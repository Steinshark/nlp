the gates of the north will be opened up and out will come the powers of the nations which were enclosed within and the whole earth will reel from their face and men will cry aloud and flee and hide themselves in the mountains and in the caves among the gravestones and they will be deadened with fear and many will perish for none will be to bury its bodies for the nations coming from the north eat the flesh of men and drink the blood of beasts like water and eat unclean things snakes and scorpions and all abominable and disgusting beasts and the reptiles that creep upon the earth and brutal things and dead bodies and the aborted fetuses of women and they will slaughter infants even producing them from their womb wombs and they will boil the meat and eat it and they will corrupt the earth and befall it and deface it and there will be no one able to stand before them um and basically this is the thing that precipitates the end [Music] [Applause] this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world [Music] [Laughter] so hello everybody we are here with richard roland once again and uh he's wearing some great symbolic world merch of uh ethiopian cross which will be related to what we're going to talk about today because today we're going to talk about the we're going to talk about gog and magog we're going to talk about the crazy hordes of nomads which come down from the steps and devastate the world and how this was inscribed mythologically in in our different texts and also how it kind of played out historically so richard thanks for coming i'm excited about this yeah this is going to be um i mean this is one of those this is one of those topics where there's like a kind of meta symbolism at play uh which is when you start trying to talk about the symbolism of the step hordes there is a literal flood of information that just kind of comes overwhelming and makes it impossible to talk about in any kind of a structured way but we're going to do our best in it so yeah so let's start we're going to start with going back into the apocalypse of pseudomethodius because this has kind of been in some ways a an example of a universal history which was extremely influential both in the in the east and the west and which has all these kind of narrative mythological images which can help us understand you know kind of how we can link actual historical events to this grand narrative uh so so start us off richard yeah so to dial things back even a little bit further than that um in the in the book of ezekiel the prophet ezekiel chapter 38 we get this reference to uh says son of man set thy face against gog the land of magog the chief prince of meshech and tubal and prophesy against him so this is a prophecy against basically the barbarian hordes of northern europe and just as one example the uh the the jewish roman historian josephus identifies gog and magog with uh or gog from magog yeah which is what it is here in ezekiel um identifies that with scythia right so the scythians are a um they're a group of uh essentially uh well they're they're an ancient nomadic people uh who lived in or who came from the region that today is what we call kazakhstan um but they were they're you know basically on the russian steps of the of the of siberia in eastern ukraine and um they invaded uh during the classical period they invaded the pontic step um and that's kind of how they came into contact with the biblical world um they're probably an iranian people in origin and anyway the main thing to understand is they are a uh they were an aggressive nomadic people um they were they they wrote on horseback back they shot bows and pretty much all the people that we talk about today are going to be aggressive nomadic people who wrote on horseback and shot bows and so this is back in the time of ezekiel you know and it gets carried forward to the the it gets carried forward to for instance the book of revelation uh revelation chapter 20 verse eight when gog and magog so there's it sort of changes the hebrew gog from magog to gog and magog but it um where they're seen as this these barbarian hordes of the north right and so we talked a little bit last time about if you draw a map facing east then the north is on your left hand right and if you're a lord of spirits listener for instance you know that north is the liturgical direction from which evil comes from which darkness comes from which the enemy comes and there are still some christian traditions today that actually for this reason certain certain services they read the the gospel facing north because it's a proclamation of the victory of christ to the enemies of god at the enemies the people of god who sort of historically come down out of the north if you lived in the levant right so we talked about this is a jerusalem-centered view of the world if you go to other cultures you'll find that other cultures have their traditional direction of evil is going to be maybe situated differently depending on where they're from yeah so but there's a general there's a general notion in that the west and the north are somewhat sinister because the west is the place where the sun goes down and the north is the place where the sun never goes so the north is naturally dark in in its the way that we actually experience it and not only that but the way we experience the north is also related to um to the cold and to you know desolate areas in terms of the the north pole but also in terms of mountains like we always have to understand the way that that even even in um even in israel like looking north they would have had those mountains that would have been right with the white caps and so yeah sort of that that whole that whole uh that psalm that says i i lift up mine eyes unto the hills and it was towards the north from where does my help come that's that's uh those are two separate phrases sometimes english translations make it sound like the the it is the hills from whence my help is coming but it's the other way around it's like i'm looking at the hills i'm looking at the mountains i'm looking towards the north who's going to help me who's going to save me right is what that solomon's asking so yeah um the basic idea here is that you have uh hordes of barbarian nomads um barbarians being you know anyone who doesn't speak greek or or just uh you know and then much later on the usage just means people who are situated outside of that sort of roman household the roman world so you've got hordes of barbarian nomads and uh typically speaking the nomads are are are horse archers right um which i don't know how nerdy you want to get here um because i was super i'm still super into this stuff when i was a kid i would go to the library and just check out every single book they had on horse nomads because i've always found them like one of the most uh fascinating uh phenomena of history um this you know this basic you know basically you have one piece of technology which is the the the composite recurve bow right and that one piece of technology makes possible the largest land empire that has ever existed in human history yeah and obviously everyone knows uh i heart the romans um you know you gotta love your parents right so like for all the things that are messed up about rome and and for all the good things too like i love roman history but i gotta give it to the mongols here you know if you're just going going like sheer size of empire you know maybe not so much lasting cultural artifacts but sheer size of empire like the mongols have it for sure yeah and um it's also interesting to read about the horse archers because of the the madness of the account like some of the accounts make them sound like these superheroes even their own accounts the way that they describe the amount of arrows they're able to shoot like the idea of catching an arrow midair and putting it in your bow and shooting it back that kind of crazy stuff i mean that is just amazing yeah that stuff is that stuff is awesome yeah the stuff is just awesome like yeah so i'm i'm super into this stuff uh several years ago there there was this amazing genghis khan exhibit that was uh touring the country and i came to dallas and so i took to my wife and some of my family members and uh that was amazing and they had a bunch of like his stuff like his armor some of his arrows things like this all there um and then there were like three people that showed up to do like the throat singing you know oh yeah yeah yeah which was yeah which is super cool so anyway all that to say um this has been uh something i've been really interested in for a long period of time and so when i talk about this stuff um it's definitely from a place of of love and as much as is appropriate a place of admiration obviously there's a lot about the mongols that would not be admirable from like any kind of a civilized point of view um all the genocide for instance you know like the it's a little problem yeah but um but for all that you know it's a really fascinating historical uh uh you know area of study i guess you could say so um and actually if somebody wants to uh if somebody wants to just like really take a deep dive into just mongol history uh from a kind of a mongolian point of view yeah dan carlin's hardcore history podcast um there's a uh he's got a series on the mongols and i don't know if it's still free you might have to pay for it but even if you do pay for it it's totally worth it's pretty long so you get a lot of hours of listening a lot of days listening out of it and uh he goes into really deep detail on a whole bunch of facets of mongolian history there are a few things in there that when i was listening to it i was like i don't think that's quite right and so i wouldn't check like primary sources that i have access to and know about it's like ah no he got this this little detail wrong or something but on the whole it's quite good so yeah people might want to check that out all right so you got this so now we've got gog and magog inscribed in revelation now moving into the alexander yeah legend or corpus yeah so we talked about the alexander romance uh quite a bit and they it's really like some people have said alexander romance is not so much a text as it is like a genre because they're actually a whole lot of different alexander legends uh there's a syriac one that is quite important um although i don't think there's a really a good english translation of it uh right now but there is a there's a there are some pretty good greek editions that will also have the interpolations for the syriac is different they'll include that and there's a pretty decent one from from penguin classics i think um so in the alexander romance and in other works that refer to it i mean uh obviously the apocalypse of pseudo-methodist one we've been talking about this is right here towards the beginning we have alexander the great do something that is actually going to um i don't know if it's the very first precedent for this but it's definitely it sets a certain pattern which then lots of uh which then we'll see play out historically in a lot of different ways and places and so what what he does there's this the story of the gates of alexander and i think in our very first ethiopia video we actually talked about this but the the gates of alexander the idea is that he goes up and there are a few different um you know geographical formations that were later named the gates of alexander and they're actually actual walls and gates that were named the gates of alexander for instance the persians built one in i want to say the sixth century and uh they called it the wall of alexander like they were very very conscious remember like alexander everybody gets to claim alexander because he's he's he was the king of everything you know yeah back then and people yeah indian they're like legends and then and uh and obviously yeah islamic legends much later and and all these so everybody kind of quran like there's yeah in the in the quran yes in the quran i mean and this this story of alexander's gates is is in the quran as well i believe yeah although he's got a different name he's not called alexander yeah yeah so anyway um so the idea is alexander goes and he builds these unbreakable gates and for instance in the uh you know the gates are usually made out of oracalcum or some other kind of magical metal yeah like an alloy like a weird yeah yeah some kind of a weird alloy because the idea is uh it's got to be magic proof because the people that he's he's uh sort of banishing beyond the the furthest reaches of human civilization they're monsters they're um and we can go into all kinds of ways in which they are monsters you know the different texts describe them differently the thing that they all tend to have in common is that they're cannibals sometimes they have the heads of dogs that eat uh bugs they um they eat you know aborted babies and like all this different stuff like they're really monstrous you know and they're banished beyond the they're banished beyond you can just understand the gates of alexander as being like the furthest point of human civilization right so there's like there's like human civilization including like the the edge and then beyond the edge there's the wall and beyond the wall there's monsters yeah and we can we need to understand it as really a mythological representation of something which has many historical iterations some which precede the the the the apocalypse and some which come later you know whether it be the chinese wall whether it be the different walls in in uh in the uk uh yeah yeah so this is virgin wall like this this is the third region yeah this is the thing that i want to wanted to point out is that historically in the east there were several different walls which were built obviously there's the great wall of china uh alexander's wall which is the second i think the second largest wall uh ever built um and actually bigger in uh than some of the early sections of the great wall of china um but uh that was built in built by the persians to keep out a group called the white huns um and uh but then yeah you've got the same thing going on in the uk um yeah the anthony wall and the hadrian's wall yeah yeah they build two different walls to keep keep out the pics and the other you know the really crazy really out there barbarian civilizations that were like you know england you know the island of britain that's the edge of the roman world literal the edge of the roman world but there's crazier stuff beyond that like monsters beyond that and they built walls to try to try to keep that stuff out and of course the the uh the story of all of these walls is that eventually they fail um you know eventually they fail and they usually fail because people people stop keeping the watch or people were bought off you know people were bribed um or or or the you know they didn't have money to maintain the wall anymore or something like that like it's always it's always you know not a failure of you could say like the physical structure itself but a failure of the vigilance failure yeah failure of attention yeah failure of attention and so they um and so something happens they stop keeping the watch on the wall and that's when the monsters start coming in and um and so this is like kind of the basic pattern of gog and magog and it it basically informs the way that the levantine world uh by by when i say the levante world i mean both the christian um the jewish and also the the uh the islamic world of the middle east during the middle ages that this this colors that affects the way that they think about and experience these step hordes which from their perspective are coming kind of out of the east and out of the north um and we talked a little bit last time about um for scandinavian peoples who at a slightly earlier uh who at slightly earlier juncture in history were gog and magog right um that's that's the um that's the thing to say about this this idea of gog and magog is a little flexible right the way i like to talk about it that it's a category like friend and stranger right so the category of stranger when i say that's a stranger it's a it's a category which is true and which exists but that but finds body and whatever embodies it and so yeah it's almost like the word barbarian itself the word barbarian doesn't actually uh it's not a it's not like an ethnic word it's a word talks about that which is outside and so i think gog and magog seems to play that role as well yeah a kind of uh a weird or goofy or uh maybe even at this point in history a sensitive example of this um just so that we say nothing at all controversial in jonathan's channel is is uh when i was growing up you know growing up in this evangelical setting um the you know in the south in in uh in the south of north america um in the american south uh so i live in the dallas area and uh dallas is actually the home of the origin point of a kind of theology called dispensationalism which all that left behind stuff the rapture stuff um [Music] we invented that yeah you're all welcome yeah you're all welcome everyone like where would you guys be without like a nicolas cage remake of a kirk cameron movie i mean that is a thing that is the thing that happened like people i don't know it's yeah it's pretty amazing uh but and so in this in this kind of dispensationalist point of view i mean i can remember when i was a kid i would just chuck out i i read every book in in our church library we had a um i don't know if that's a thing that a lot of the churches that i grew up and had like a church library yeah [Music] at my parish now we have a church bookstore which is not quite the same thing um but um but we had a church library and you could uh and actually i volunteered at the at the church library surprising to everyone um i volunteered at the church library so i would go and i would i would work there on sunday afternoons after church to help people check books out and check books back in and contact people who are late on their books and so on and um anyway so the uh but this church library was mostly books about the end times pro about end times prophecy i mean that was it was a very small room there were probably 2 300 books and they were mostly about end times prophecy and at some point in the process of my childhood i read all of these books wow i was just really fascinated by this stuff and one of the things that um uh you know i read this one book and the thing is like i didn't know how old some of these books were like a lot of these books were written in like the 70s and 80s so yeah and so this is the thing this is this is where this long and rambly story is going is that i would read this story and it you know and it you know i'm reading a book that's written during the cuban missile crisis right and so gog and magog are cuba and russia and then i'd go home and i'd be like really freaked out i'm like dad do you know about these missiles in cuba and all this stuff and he'd be like actually that that happened like a long time ago and it's not you know when you know to happen before you were born it's not a problem now it's you know but yeah so so this is the thing is that that gog and magog were you know russia and china or russia and cuba or you know they're basically like whatever whoever the other is whoever the enemy is whatever the sort of unknown um and and it's kind of like uh it i mean in in currently like political correct critical race theory discourse and things like that there's this there's a lot of talk about not othering people right but there's there's something to that right and what i mean by that is is basically as soon as as soon as like something becomes really familiar to you uh you could say as soon as it becomes sort of domesticated um you know so as so if you uh if you don't know i mean for instance you know russia is the bad guy you know right now in america so like if you don't know a whole lot about russian politics or culture things like this then it's really easy and and obviously this russia is gog and magog stuff has been making the rounds again right because of that um if you do know a lot about the political situation over there then you might not you know uh you could say oh this war is terrible we need to pray for these people all this stuff but but in your mind they're the sort of they're other human beings nations have wars all the time we need to pray for the situation but but there's not that that not that same sense that you know they're the barbarian horde on the edge of the world right so it's it's uh so this is an identity that is always kind of looking for a home you could say yeah well that's why that's why one of the reasons why emphasizing christopher so much is because i think that the iconos and christopher md the story of saint christopher is a way to both acknowledge the strangeness but then give you a method by which to to domesticate it and then engage it so i think that that's it's important to understand that and i what you see in the old pentecost icons is something like that too which is like we acknowledge the strangeness of the of the the foreigner but then we don't we don't see that as an absolute limit like it is possible to slowly enter into contact with them and that and then yeah kind of bring them into our bring them into a relationship but that's not a but it's so it's not it's when people say don't bother others like don't other than that's like you can't do that we're made that way like this is something that we do automatically if you don't realize that you do it then you'll do it unconsciously uh and and you won't even realize just as you're criticizing people from for othering you'll be doing it at the same time right um exactly right better to recognize it as a normal mechanism of perception that we see strange things as kind of monstrous kind of hybrid you know off-key and then how is it then that now we can domesticate that to the extent that it's possible sometimes you also don't because i'm there are some strange things that are dangerous for you you know it's like that that really could so if you if you see a dark stranger in an alleyway you know you don't know who it is but you might not want to domesticate that dark stranger in an alleyway it might be better to walk away because that dark stranger in the alleyway might just kill you you know yeah i mean weird food is another great example um i mean i grew up eating uh in kind of like an asian american household uh so kind of living in these two worlds we ate a lot of ate a lot of chinese food like really traditional chinese food and a lot of traditional chinese food and let's say like traditional poor people food in general right the way that the way that something like i'll pick on you because you're french ish the way that the way that a snail becomes a delicacy right you're not supposed to eat snails you're not snails are bugs they crawl around on the ground they're slimy you shouldn't eat snails but if you're poor enough you will figure out a way to cook a snail so that it kind of tastes good and that's when there a flip happens and you have all these things that used to be basically poor people food i mean a great example is shrimp or octopus or any other invertebrate that comes out of the ocean that's all trash food yeah right that's mediterranean trash food that's why it's that's why you're allowed to eat it during a fast because it's a bug right so that's trash food it's crawling around in the filth at the bottom of the ocean right literally at the bottom of the abyss right at the bottom of hell there's a bug crawling around eating garbage and you're allowed to eat that but eventually people figured out a way to like cook that so it's really tasty and uh and that's why like in the united states shrimp lobster et cetera are delicacies so um i mean that's a good way to to understand the process of domesticating a certain thing but then there's stuff that's like even beyond that a little bit i took the kids to the dallas world aquarium aquarium yesterday and uh they had like a bunch of puffer fish in the tank and i was looking showing them the puffer fish and unfortunately none of them got angry at us i was hoping we'd see one of them kind of you know pop up but but we were talking about puffer fish i was explaining to them how puffer fish work and what they do and how they protect themselves and uh but then also explaining that you know puffer fish are extremely toxic and potentially lethal to eat but that hasn't stopped them from being a delicacy in certain asian countries yeah um japan in particular right and so so then that's like that's like taking that to the very edge of what you can do in terms of domesticating something right but then there's stuff that nobody can eat right there's there's there's stuff that nobody can integrate yeah but i think and the images that we see in the the way they represent gog and magog right like that they say that they're cannibals the fact that they say that they that they eat human fetuses you know like that the other images that could be used would be incest or all these kind of taboos that cannot be integrated that they just can't like if we integrate them they could destroy society yeah yeah and and you know drinking the blood of animals which is actually a thing that a lot of these nomadic tribes certainly did you know drinking drinking mares blood uh drinking you know eating eating horse flesh things like that horse flesh is a um let's say uh uh a a gray area when it comes to food to booze um a lot of a lot of societies don't eat horses for some reason that they don't eat dogs is like uh it's a little it's an animal that's a little a little too close to the human experience in some way um but also also unclean for you know uh other reasons as well so yeah um so you've got so you've got the symbolism of gog and mega out on the edge you've got the gates of alexander and then that that idea of the gates of alexander actually manifests itself literally a bunch of times in throughout history right so you can i mean this is the way to read this apocalyptic literature is to look for the pattern and then see the way the pattern is manifesting but in in the apocalypse and in the alexander romance and in the islamic legends the idea is that at the end of the world one of the things that will bring about the end of the world or while the end of the world is playing out of gogen the gates of alexander will be breached and gag and magog will be unleashed on the world to kind of devour it judge it all that stuff yeah yeah so this is this idea um that we find in the apocalypse of pseudo-methodius but we actually find it way before this in in the old testament and in the book of revelation for that matter right in all of this apocalyptic apocalyptic literature even in things like the prophecy of habakkuk right what the prophecy of habakkuk is all about why would god use these heathen barbarian nations in this case the neoc what are called the neo-assyrians by historians today in the bible they're called the babylonians why would god use them to uh why would god use them to punish his own people right isn't that i and this is a big question i mean there's a bunch of the ezra literature so like um there's a whole there's a whole genre of of literature in the in the second temple jewish period around the prophet ezra and his apocalyptic visions um and so this starts out with a book called fourth esdras uh which is actually in the russian orthodox bible um so if you're in the russian tradition it's in your bible you should go read it it's actually pretty rad it's super cool um uh and it's all about this this idea like why why would god use uh why would god use unjust people to punish his own people you know which is this question that comes up over and over again in the holy scriptures and then kind of more generally like why would god use barbarians to punish you know roman civilization why would god use demons to chastise humankind things like this right it's it's that same question kind of over and over again and we see that um we see that question kind of expressed here like that's one of the main things the apocalypse of pseudo-methodius is dealing with the the the time of this of the writing here is probably during the muslim conquest of much of the levant and much of the byzantine world and so that's one of the things that the author is trying to really come to terms with is to say why are we what's going on here what happened to the you know the kingdom of god what's going on which is also a question that a lot earlier for instance augustine is trying to answer said augustine try to answer when he writes the city of god right it's the same same kind of a question when we're confronted with history that doesn't seem to be going the way we think it should we have to sort of we have to step back and get this apocalyptic perspective and that's what an apocalypse is for it's to show you here are the patterns of the ends of things but also the the larger pattern of how god is working in the world and so this is what it says it says that um [Music] after the the conquest of uh of visas or you know there's the byzantines by ishmael and ishmael's children um that he's going to uh he'll he'll eventually be defeated uh ishmael will eventually be defeated and he'll be defeated by two things one will be the resurgence of the king of the romans coming out of ethiopia which you've already talked about and then the other thing um the other thing that's going to happen is going to be that the gates of the north will be opened up and out will come the powers of the nations which were enclosed within and the whole earth will reel from their face and men will cry aloud and flee and hide themselves in the mountains and in the caves among the gravestones and they will be deadened with fear and many will perish for none will be to bury its bodies for the nations coming from the north eat the flesh of men and drink the blood of beasts like water and eat unclean things snakes and scorpions and all abominable and disgusting beasts and the reptiles that creep upon the earth and brutal things and dead bodies and the aborted fetuses of women and they will slaughter infants even producing them from their womb wombs and they will boil the meat and eat it and they will corrupt the earth and befall it and to face it and there will be no one able to stand before them um and basically this is the thing that priest precipitates the end um the king of the romans after this shortly he he he gives up the kingdom we've talked about this already he gives up the kingdom to god and when he gives up the kingdom of god the antichrist appears and then the end comes right so um this so there's this idea that as part of the end of you could say like the end of a cycle or the end of a period or the end of the world right as part of part of what happens at the end is that the barrier is broken down and all the things that you were keeping out they show up and they show up they show up uh as this powerful destructive force but also as sort of a um you know what saint gregory nissa would refer to as the left hand of god right is they they show up and and their destruction is not without a purpose right yeah that it becomes sort of like a um like a wildfire right where it kind of burns down all the stuff that shouldn't you know all the corruption all the decadence that's building up yeah and also a flood it's really related to the flood yeah yeah yeah definitely related to the idea of the flood that comes but people like and i think just maybe to kind of point to the symbolic aspect how people understand that this is really the description of death in general it's a description of how something ends so you have a that's what death is when the outside things finally break in that's what death is so you are there your your body you're fighting the outside your your body is holding together and kind of let's say integrating some outside things you know ejecting some some things but then at some point your body stops to do that and then the worms the things everything breaks apart and everything from the outside comes in and then there's no difference between the inside and the outside you basically decompose and so this image of the barbarians coming in finally breaking the barrier that's what it is it's the same thing like i have an apple falling to the ground and then ultimately it starts to to get mushy and finally it breaks down and then the inside and the outside coalesce but it also is a breaking down which can produce fertile ground for a new beginning at the same time right that's just a natural pattern of things did you ever read uh the last battle like the final narnia book i read it when i was like 11. that that book is like one of the most insightful books to read if you just want to see the pattern of the end of the thing and and this is one of the things that happens at the very end as the i mean it's you know starts with you know it starts with the the ape which is like a false man and the donkey which is like a false lion and all this stuff uh really beautiful symbolism um we should we should like read that and talk about it one day because i think people would would really think out of it but um uh but what you know as the as the world is ending as narnia is is kind of ending you know the stars fall out of the sky um of course in narnia just like in our world stars are our people and um and maybe not just like in our world but similarly and uh so as but so one of the things that happens as the world is ending is that there are all these monsters that live in the northern wastes okay so it's again in the north and this is the nice thing about narnia um if you're trying to get it get a sense of things and like a biblical you know a biblical cosmology or framework narnia is also east facing which means all your bad stuff comes out of the north because it's to the left and um uh whereas whereas for reasons we talked about in the previous video tolkien's legendarium for instance is west facing um although bad guys also live in the north in in in the legend in tolkien's legendarium but um but the but the really scary stuff comes out of the east yeah so um uh but all these monsters and they're just they're described as being like dragons giant lizards giant snakes all these different things they're at the very end of things they are released out of the north and they come down and they just eat everything until there's nothing but barren rock and then they die yeah right and the idea is it's just like a cleaning or like a scouring um that that takes place and uh this is one of these things you know louis louis's symbolic intuition was really strong in certain places so definitely yeah that'd be a fun book to look at sometime i keep coming across things that i'm like you know if we did a symbolic world uh like like a read-through kind of like a universal history reading club or something like that there's some stuff that would be kind of fun to go over that'd be great yeah so all right we have the description of these monsters barbarians that are up in us and then then we have examples like let's say fractal examples of that happening when these these groups pour in from the steps and basically ravage society you know try to turn society into grazing pasture basically yeah so the earliest uh furthest examples of this were basically the uh the germanic peoples the uh in in western european history this is what is referred to as the barbarian invasion starts in fifth and sixth centuries um and it is what basically precipitates the breakdown of the western half of the roman empire there are a bunch of different people groups that are involved in this and basically you get successive waves because basically you have one really big group in the back which was the huns and they're pushing all the other groups forward and so it's like you have a most monstrous group and then they're pushing the second most monstrous group who are pushing the third who are pushing forth so you start out by having oh you think these people are really uncivilized but actually they're kind of civilized because they've lived in contact with roman civilization for a long time and those guys in fade and they invade and they settle and then what the romans end up doing is hiring those guys to fight the next wave of invaders yeah and that's a great i mean that if you want to understand an image of reality that's a really that's a good uh yeah itself and it's a way that uh you could say and then uh this civ that it's it's how civilization puts on garments of skins you could say is like taking the taking the you know like a literal garment of skin would be something like i kill an animal and i wear skin yeah right so you have this you have this you know basically i i integrate a new civilization and i wear that civilization skin so i i um i mean this happened in the united states when the quakers came and settled pennsylvania um big shout out to the the forest of william penn i'll be there uh next week with father andrew um but um uh when the quakers settled pennsylvania they had all these problems with uh with the native americans that were living around them because quakers are pacifists and turns out the native americans were not and uh so they what they did is they invited all of these scotch irish to come and settle on either side of them right the scotch irish being famously bellicose people you know uh because they didn't want to fight so they they took somebody who was like a little more barbaric than they were and settled them on either side of them yes so that they would have somebody to do their fighting you know for them so i mean this is a thing that that this is it's a thing that happens and um it can help you understand then that when you're dealing with this problem of identity there are two things there are two things you want to do one is you want to you always have to understand the function of the fringe on the edge because the fringe on the edge can sometimes be a little annoying but if you get rid of it there's a bigger fringe waiting for you behind it so that's why you always have to be careful when you remove you'd say the things that don't fit from your society because behind that are things that really don't fit and not only don't fit but actually want to devour you yeah yeah yep so uh in the roman empire the way this worked is they would br as these barbarian tribes invaded they would fight them for a little bit and then eventually they would buy them off they would buy them off and pay them to fight the next wave and obviously there are a lot of historians uh gibbon is the most famous one who wrote the decline and fall of the roman empire and he basically sees the the decline and fall of the roman empire which he really sees as being the western empire he did not have any kind of a love for for the east um but he uh he basically sees the decline in the fall of the roman empire as being a result of two things one is christianity coming and emasculating good rom you know hard roman virtue um uh didn't not a big fan of christianity was was yes we know that yeah and then but then the other thing that you saw as being a major cause of the downfall of the empire was the way that they were hiring uh that that the way that they weren't you know producing their own soldiers anymore they kept hiring new barbarian mercenaries but i mean the sort of problem with that is is that uh the thing i think gibbon didn't understand super well is that this is just this is the normal pattern like in in america today for instance our military is is a is an entirely volunteer force right and so and and of course living in the united states and especially in the south there is certainly a tendency to kind of glorify our military uh where i live for instance yesterday here from when we're recording this in the states was memorial day which is a day to remember and and if you're an orthodox christian it's also a day to pray for uh fallen american soldiers nothing wrong with that however we sort of forget that historically the reality has been you do your army is not made up of your best people armies tend to be made up of the people who cannot fit in society otherwise right the the let's say the dog-headed men in your in your society and you said those are the guys that you send out to fight the bigger monsters on the edge right and so this is the same pattern the same pattern that was happening in rome during the late republic period but now it's just being extended further right toward as as the empire reaches its end and so um the big the two biggest groups that come in um the first one is the goths who cause all kinds of trouble for rome um they cause all kinds of trouble for christianity uh in that the goths are uh when they were evangelized they were primarily evangelized by aryans you know they were coming they were they were invading and coming into contact with rome uh really right during that period of you know the aryan controversy so a lot of them were evangelized by aryans um although also they they actually in an ironic twist they also killed the last aryan emperor in battle so there you go salt so they sort of solved that problem but also caused it caused another problem and uh the goths in spain particularly the visigoths remained uh remained aryan for a really long time and there are some people who who believe or say that the filioque originated uh in what in spain and the iberian peninsula as a way to kind of combat this mysterious among the gods yeah which is probably probably true so um all that to say you've got the goss and then behind the goss come the last big scary group of this long procession of barbarians and that is the huns right yeah so i think most people like even if you don't know the details of the hunnic invasion of the roman empire like you probably have heard of attila the hunt yeah the image you have somewhere in your mind yeah yeah right like it's a it's a i mean that is a cultural memory which has left such a deep scar in all peoples of western european or northern european descent or eastern european for that matter um and mean the thing about the huns is like we don't even totally know who they were um they were certainly a big confederation of tribes but for instance a lot of the hanukkah names that we have attila being a good example are actually gothic so um so they were basically there were goths fighting the huns but there were probably also a bunch of goths among the huns right so at the very end it was just this big conglomeration that had sort of picked up had probably started in what is now mongolia but as it made its way across eurasia and ended up in western europe it had just picked up all of these other people groups as they went so attila's name uh this is fun uh actually is a gothic word for little daddy um so it was like uh probably like a term of endearment from his from his gothic soldiers yeah yeah but he's also known as the scourge of god yeah he's also known as the scourge of god yeah and i mean it's one of the great moments in history is when he's invading he's marching towards rome and uh uh the pope goes out yeah he goes out to to meet him and they have some kind of a conversation and a tillage turns around it's so that's that's like one of the most mysterious moments in history you can't trying to understand what happened there it's very difficult yeah yeah i mean really quite amazing but something to say about attila and this will be also true for genghis khan much later in history is that attila was very conscious of the role that he was playing uh in terms of being the sort of left hand of god right so he let's say he leaned into this scourge of god identity right um and of course attila had had grown up uh let's say he was no stranger to roman culture he's no stranger to christianity right um there had been like some fostering and hostage swapping and things like that that had gone on during his childhood so he'd spent a lot of time around romans and he had basically like foster brothers who were the sons of of roman consuls and emperors and things like this so he was no no stranger to roman culture no stranger to christianity and he and he was very familiar with like he he understood the role that he was playing and he really kind of leaned into it um and and of course he's eventually defeated and driven back at a very famous battle and um but his his invasion i mean that sets you know the earliest uh the earliest uh no the earliest bit of germanic poetry that we have the earliest bit of norse poetry that we have is this poem called the battle of the goths and the huns like it's the very that's the very oldest bit of written poetry that we have you know from that society so it it left like a deep deep memory in all of these different cultures so much later on um you have the mongols and before we talk about the moguls this is a good place to introduce so we have this idea of we have this idea of gog and magog right coming out of the north we also have this idea of professor john and we talked a little bit about professor john at the end of the last video the idea of presser john is basically this this idea of that there's this king who is in the extreme east or maybe the extreme south sometimes he's in ethiopia other times he's uh in india and we talked about how for the reasons for which those are kind of the same location in the roman world um and uh he's uh the the title prester in english this is an adaptation of of the greek word for priest as an and and it's a it's it's a it's a cognate with our own word priest and the basic idea of president john is that he's this king of the east but he's a priest king now the whole priest king thing is a um this is one thing that tells you that he is uh legendary or mythical but also that tells you that he sort of belongs to uh another world or like another more extreme world because like the you know there are lots of priest kings in the ancient world and then in the in the kingdom of israel priests the priesthood and the kingship those gets more or less permanently separated and they are only actually unified in christ right and so the idea is that there's this melchizedek priesthood is this really ancient priesthood one of these days we should talk about melchizedek um because there's all kinds of yeah a lot of freaky legends which maybe they can't maybe they cannot or should not talk about on lord of spirits but we can definitely talk about in this context um there's some weird stuff around man but um uh so so there's this idea that there's this king out there this king in the east and um the this you know and and these legends are predicated on these ideas the reason we laid all the groundwork we did last time right is because there's this idea there was this fourth son of noah who was enlightened he went to the far east there is this um there is this king of india that was evangelized by the apostle thomas right so there's all these different legends especially in syrian christianity of a king in the east yeah so but you can also understand that there were that the professor john figure is a is really a function it's not an individual yeah yeah this is because yeah because people are looking for him a thousand years later like they're you know people you know christopher columbus is still looking for for for press or john or whatever like this is it really is something like a this function that exists in the east of a christian uh a christian kingdom that could that we could be connected to yeah so it's it like you just said it's really important to understand that this is a role right and so the fact that it um so the actual legend of pressure john first materializes in um prob probably starts to trickle in via oral accounts especially during the crusades as peop as people from western europe are going east a lot but also just across the trade routes these rumors have been trickling in for hundreds of years but they're first written down in the 12th century um in a chronicle actually a work of universal history a deliberate work of universal history uh by otto of freising um in his chronic on which he wrote in about 11 45 and just as a side note i i would love to actually like there's not a good translation of the chronic con into english um and maybe if i have just excessive amounts of free time one of these days i'll try to do one um because i think people might get a huge kick out of reading an actual work of of of of medieval universal history and just see that we're not making any of this stuff up but um yeah so in his chronic on he he recounts that he had met uh this guy named hugh um and he was the bishop of basically the crusader kingdom of edessa and so he was like a western like a latin bishop in syria at that time because of the crusades and he ran into hugh at the court of pope eugene iii and um hugh told um and basically he was on a on an embassy that eventually results in pope eugene calling for the second crusade but hugh tells otto who is writing this all down in the chronicle he tells him that prester john um who is this uh this king of the east who serves in the dual position of priest and king had basically conquered the kingdom of or the city of um uh batana which is a very very important ancient persian uh kingdom for our city from uh that he'd that he had conquered it from the islamic caliphate in a great battle so there's this rumor that there was this christian king out there who's sort of eating away at the caliphate from from the from the eastern side and um uh but what's what's interesting is that otto mentions in this account that he was supposed to then be marching out to rescue jerusalem and conquer the holy land uh but that the swollen waters of the tigris river had forced him to return back to his own country and um there is a an idea here that comes up again in some of the later prester john accounts which is there is this christian king of the east he's conquering the he's conquering the caliphate but he probably won't show up at jerusalem anytime soon so you can't count on his help um and i think that it was very important like they're trying to get crusades going you know it's very important to say listen you can't just count on these guys to do it yourself we got to do our bit too um but um and there may have been some uh for instance there are several historians who have connected this with real historical events um uh of when the uh the the uh one of the khanates um one of the candidates one of the mongolian khanates actually did defeat um defeat the seljuk turks in persia in a pretty large battle about four years before this account so okay there probably is like a historical event you could say that that kind of ties into this yeah so already people are going to hear that it ends up being a connection between professor john and the mongols or the these steps and specifically between pressure john and the what we could call the nestorian christians or the church of the east under presser john so at this point we should just say a little bit about this um uh most people who follow symbolic the symbolic world are probably at least a little bit familiar with the fact that there was a major church council called the council of ephesus which is also sometimes referred to as the third ecumenical council and it was at this ecumenical council that the the theology of nestorius right who said that um uh he said that mary was not the mother of god that she's only the mother of christ right and so that she only let's say gave birth to his human uh human nature not his divine nature um and this churching was repudiated by the church at the at the council of ephesus um uh specifically through the theology of saint cyril of alexandria uh who said listen mothers don't give birth to natures that give birth to persons right very simple um and so because of this it is it is it is meat and right one could say to call mary the theotokos the the mother of god the one who gave birth to god and uh so the churches that rejected this uh which were you know the majority of churches that rejected this sort of fell outside of the the what was really the roman empire the roman world the roman sphere of influence at the time the churches that rejected this became known as the uh as either as the historian church historian christians um and some people say that that's like a pejorative term we should use that to talk about them and i i mean i don't know um i've talked to folks from the church of the east who who you know definitely consider nestorius to be a saint is one of their saints and identify themselves as historians but um some people prefer the term true to the east so whatever floats your boat people um and uh and so the church of the eastern historian church um this is this is the uh basically the majority of christians in persia um what is modern day like iraq iran and um going all the way to china and so we talked last time we talked last time about this um this uh uh for instance raban bar salma who's this chinese monk who makes a pilgrimage all the way from beijing to basically makes it as far as paris um one of the longest overland journeys ever recorded actually um and uh makes it to paris and while he's there in paris he actually communes king edward the first at mass so i mean that's a pretty pretty wild story um but um um he was a he was what we consider an historian and the christian missions in china were historian yes yeah and there's a lot of really good documentation now about the basically there was a there was a a relatively successful in the story in mission uh where uh you know under a certain dynasty under the tong dynasty where christianity was highly tolerated um in ancient china and so and so it grew and flourished and you can like look at early documents where it seems like they're really struggling to speak to the chinese people in their own language and then there are later documents where you can see they've done the basically the same things that christianity did with the language of greek philosophy they do that with like the language of taoist philosophy and are able to are able to more successfully talk about christ in a way that the chinese people can kind of comprehend um and then there is a big wave of persev persecution and it almost gets completely wiped out and then it has another resurgence under the mongols exactly and so part of the mongols part of the people associated with the mongols or that were part of the mongol tribes would have been historian certain yeah in sections certain tribes and groups and they're the big kind of yeah the nestorians were never a um they were never a majority in the mongols but there were there were whole tribes of mongols who were historian christians and there were um a lot of uh you you have the same kind of thing going on in early roman history where it's like the majority of romans aren't christians but they're like a suspicious number of wives and mothers of powerful roman men who who are who are i don't know it's like uh it's kind of a kind of a thing about christianity and mothers i don't know you know it's uh and so you have the same kind of thing happening in the khanates so there were there were whole tribes of of um there were whole tribes of the mongols who were christians and actually marched to battle behind the sign of the cross um and this is actually this is an important detail because this is one of the things there is in the 1160s there's this letter that circulates called the letter of presser john that circulates all throughout western europe and it's it describes the glories of the kingdom of pressure john and his armies and things like this and the part of the reason that i spent so much time talking about the alexander romance and the letter of alexander to aristotle in our previous video is because a lot of this a lot of the this letter is sort of you could say cribbed from the alexander stuff and some of his crib from other sources like the acts of thomas right and so there's this basically we you know you could say the western world and i'm including like constantinople in the western world in this particular frame had a had a vocabulary for talking about the great king of the east and so they took that vocabulary and they used it to describe this this sort of legendary figure of presser john but one of the things that's described in there is you know his his army is marching to battle behind the sign of a cross which you can you can see being like a kind of a comforting thing for uh for crusaders and for other people uh who are fighting in the middle east themselves marching to battle behind the sign of the cross and then they hear hey there's somebody else way over there who's doing that too but but there there is a historical reality like from a modern historical perspective there's a reality behind that which is there there really were mongols who were marching to battle behind the strength of the cross yeah and lots and lots of famous um uh descendants of genghis khan for instance um several of his grandsons uh sons-in-law um daughter-in-law uh who is uh who is an historian christian um so there are lots of there are lots of historian christians and actually one or two of these historian christian bishops who actually converted to calcidonian christianity and uh did not go super well for them when they did that but um it is the thing that happened so there's a lot more that could be said about this but for our purposes it's just important to understand this and i mean the thing is most most people maybe don't know very much about the mongols at all other than that you know they were scary and they invaded and genghis khan and like they've seen mulan um you know whatever although i think in the mulan cartoon they're actually fighting the huns because that was like a less politically dangerous uh uh thing it needs to use yeah yeah um but all this to say the the the there was a significant nestorian or church of the east christian minority among the mongols uh during this entire period and this this this led to lots of alliances between the uh the land crusader kingdoms or the the let's call them the franks because that's fun um but uh uh but i mean those alliances are called the the franco mongolian alliance right yeah um because there's a there's an embassy there was an ambassador and all the way to france one of the ambassadors and there are texts there are letters that you can read and the king asks ask the ambassador like how's president john doing he's like oh he's doing fine it's like yeah he doesn't think he's not created that he exists it's not just that like for instance uh uh doku's cartoon who's the wife of huluga khan and the mother of a bakker khan right with uh hulu khan hulago hulagu khan there we go being the guy that sucks baghdad right so this is his wife um she and uh her um [Music] her mom i think i might have that wrong it might have been her one of her daughters but uh they're referred to no it's it's she is she and she and like a cousin or something that's an another female relative of hers they're referred to in letters to the french and in letters to the king of con uh the emperor of constantinople they are referred to as being the daughters of professor john huh like like and and actually do we know their parents who they're who they're i i have no idea her daughter or sorry her son abaku khan marries maria pelo peologina of the byzantine emperor michael viii so so literally at one point there was a marriage alliance between the the the mongolian khanate and then a byzantine princess like so at one point the khan was the son-in-law of the byzantine emperor yeah that's a thing that happened which is crazy it's wild right well it can make you on it can help you understand a little more what what what's going on or why it isn't these types of legends because they're difficult because they're so vague and they move around that's why they appear also in this kind of mythological form because there's something real that's happening but it's also hard to point down because it's so slippery uh that it ends up boiling into this character it's like oh they we can't we can't talk about all this these weird mongolian tribes and these christians among them it's like okay professor john this is the way we talk about it and so it can help people understand also why things appear in mythological forms yeah because it's a way to talk about uh talk about phenomena that it's sometimes hard to encapsulate yeah because there's too much detail like like even me trying to describe something like the frankish mongolian alliance or the byzantine mongolian alliances or the ways that they coordinated together to defeat the the caliphate and you know all this different stuff like there's just too much detail but i can basically just say presto john you know and like like it kind of it kind of actually encapsulates all of these different scenarios and so one of the crazy things that that we mentioned together before we started is that we have to remember that the apocalypse of pseudomethodius is also a nestorian syrian type not not an historian but oh it's not um maybe maybe a probably non-uh probably non-chalcedonian yeah yeah so so to ivy just a little bit of like uh uh so you have the the the third ecumenical council which is rejected by the historian churches um and then you had the fourth ecumenical council which is rejected by the groups that we so we now call like the oriental orthodox so that's a really recent label right like the cops and the ethiopians and the armenians and um and also some of some of the other uh saint thomas christians are like that the syrian versus uh syria is how that's usually yeah so that you have like syrians who are non-calcedonian and then assyrians who were who rejected the council of ephesus but did actually formally accept the council of calciton so it's a it's kind of a an interesting kind of a thing so so then the the the epoxy of the pseudomythologies would have been the non-cacidonian yeah yeah yeah which which again we talked about this because in the apocalypse of pseudo-methodius the place where byzantium and ethiopia come back together happens at calcidon in yeah i remember yeah yeah yeah so um yeah so so all of this is to kind of say uh we should probably at this point talk about the really big place where this prophecy kind of comes to pass right so this idea is you have these barbarian kingdoms out of the north these monsters on the edge of the world and if you just read the way that for instance the the the muslim uh caliphates the umayyad caliphate and the other ones the way that they experienced the mongols when the mongols invaded they understood the mongols as being the wrath of god um and in fact um again genghis khan much like attila the hung genghis khan leaned into this so when he would show up to invade somewhere there's this great quote it's my favorite genghis khan quote and it goes something like your sins must have been really terrible for the god of heaven to have set me loose upon you like just yeah and even even the even the like the really pro-christian or at least christian friendly cons when they would send embassies to talk to the pope or to the you know the king of france or something they actually started out uh interacting mainly with the pope and then at some point they realized i think it's actually the king of france that is running europe and so they they switched to just talking to him but they would send these embassies and they would be like uh yeah the god of heaven has ordained that you're going to bow the knee before us so you should probably get on with that and we'd be more than happy to help you with your problem in the middle east but you should probably get on with you know uh sending tribute please please uh please address your tribute payments too here's here's here's the address you know kind of a thing uh really i mean even the really uh the friendliest mongolian embassies were like this yeah you know and um so they saw themselves they saw themselves functioning in this kind of way as the left hand of god and they leaned into it um they saw themselves as the judgment of god or the gods uh mongolia's society is pretty pluralistic um sometimes sometimes but um but they saw themselves basically as the judgment of god on these different on these different uh countries and so this kind of culminates for instance in the destruction of baghdad um and this direction of baghdad under uh uh hulagu khan is probably one of the most scarring and most complete military victories slash genocides in the history of humanity yeah um unless you've read a lot of literature from this period you cannot understand i mean uh the city of baghdad was an incredibly developed city extremely wealthy extremely advanced extremely decadent all these things and um very powerful and when it was destroyed it was cataclysmic you know it was it was like it was analogous to the fall of constantinople for the muslim world yeah but even much worse because yeah he actually was raised to the ground yeah the libraries were burned they were like you know mounds of skulls like it was just insane yeah i'm not even going to describe the atrocities because they were really bad um but you can go and look this stuff up um yeah i mean just like i somebody did the math one time on how many uh i mean this here's the thing about the mongols like people don't understand the romans were also good at this um is is that the mongols and the romans both worked out because you'll read they massacred this many people this many tens of thousands of people over this many hours so then like you'd have to start like you can do the math on that and figure how many people per hour would you have to kill to massacre that number of people and you realize that at some point these people i mean the mongols were not at some point they figured out the most efficient ways of quickly killing large numbers of people i don't know how to say it like like we're talking genocides yeah unprecedented in human history up to that point and um yeah so somebody's done the math on the siege of baghdad and like how many people they had to be slaughtering per hour but one of the things that happens in the siege of baghdad is that doku's cartoon you know this christian wife of the khan she intercedes on the behalf of the nestorian christians living in the city of baghdad at the time and they are largely spared the destruction i don't think they're totally spared i mean uh you know sacking a city is real messy jonathan uh but um but but they are largely spare the destruction of the city so this is a way that this this this you say this legend of pressure john um manifested itself in this in this uh kind of ultimate or final way yeah it's really kind of dark way but yeah in a dark way yeah um and and i will say after this the mongols and the byzantines and the franks like did continue to work together and there are differing you know over the next two or three generations and there are kind of differing uh perspectives from modern day scholars and historians as to how effective their efforts were or were not um but if people want to read about that stuff they can they can go out and look it up so it's important for people to to understand that there are images of hulagu and his wife or hulago and his mother i think that are represented as constantine and helen holding holding across your cross in the center yeah yeah i mean again this is wild stuff and uh people should not for a moment take away that you know like we're endorsing something like genocide in the name of christ right or something like that because it's not at all a that's not at all what we're talking about and b like you would just have to understand the this is the symbolism of of of the edge like the gates of alexander being open this is what happens and um and it's something that happened historically um and you know obviously in this dark and terrible way it was an awful awful time for probably everyone involved but it did happen and um the way that uh from the perspective this jerusalem-centric perspective of history that we've been talking about of understanding the world the way that they describe that was was through these legends of pressure john this king of the east this christian king of the east um which which by the way um uh doku's cut uh or sorry uh uh hulagu khan himself was not a christian no in fact he i uh he was he was a shamanist and and converted probably to buddhism at the end of his life despite the wishes of his wife so he wasn't a christian yeah nobody nobody's really saying he was but he was participating in this pattern of presser john that was so important to to the sort of you could say franco byzantine world at the time so so the last thing i want to mention maybe before we we we finish is that there is also an interesting and important understanding of this kind of wind or fire that comes from the north and when we we talk about how it is both a force of destruction but also a force of renewal is a way that we can also see if we look at the historical precedent of how that works so you can see that what happens when the people come down from the north usually is that they bring something like strength but they don't bring identity their identity is mixed their identity is confused it's a mixture of tribes it's a mixture of religions it's all this kind of wild kind of chaos and then they come in from the north they destroy and then they usually become fertile ground for something new and what ends up happening is that the strength of these northern invaders gets taken up by the identity of the people they invaded and that's like the weirdest thing but it's important to understand that so when the germanic goths and and all these germanic people come down and try to destroy rome they end up becoming the defenders of rome and end up becoming the continuation of the roman empire when charlemagne uh you know becomes holy roman empire and all these northern people kind of take up the roman identity we see the same when the the vikings are coming down the norm they they they're they they're given normandy they convert to to christianity and then they become the place of strength for western europe becomes in normandy and and the norm has become the strength we see the same with the russians scandinavians come down to russia they convert to orthodox christianity the same with the mongols the mongols come down they become the emperors of china they become the emperors of india they become all these these powerful figures but that don't actually preserve their mongolian identity yeah end up taking up the identity of islam or buddhism or of the different groups that they encounter and so this is a type of interaction that we often struggle to understand we don't think in these terms but it's important to see that this is a type of interaction which is possible and which exists and also understanding that strength and identity are not the same thing power and identity are not the same things uh and that that sometimes even a minority that has identity can take over a very very powerful group uh it's not just about strength and about military might yeah i mean there's there's a there's a plethora of historical examples of this where you have a a small but powerful minority who brings in strength and then adopts the adopts the identity of the larger group such they such as they become like the new guardians of what it really means to to to fully embody that identity there's a whole string all the best emperors of a certain period of the roman empire were illyrians who were all barbarians but they were power they were skilled generals they were effective leaders um and so what they were able to do is actually embody roman identity in a way that the romans themselves had lost the ability to do um there are lots of there are lots of other examples of this as well that you can find throughout history um and yeah i mean it's important to say that er the the khanate the ilkana destroyed baghdad but the golden horde which is the longest lasting remnant or the longest lasting part of the mongolian empire uh and of course obviously ruled over you know russia and lots of other orthodox territories for a long time and then the church yeah but the golden horde was muslim right they they adopted they eventually i adopted the identity of the people that they conquered um and uh i mean this is this is powerful even within christianity right now right not just in orthodoxy but in pretty much every every kind of christianity that is um you know that that sees itself in a traditional way let's say we have we have lots of people who are coming in from really difficult backgrounds really rough backgrounds um who were not christians before who were not uh uh who were maybe even the enemies of christianity before and then as they're converting they are uh they're becoming really vocal defenders of their faith and maybe not always in that you know people who have been christians a long time they're like oh man i don't you shouldn't talk to people that way or something like that you know but but we we need to understand what's going on here um that this is actually something that's really vital and important in terms of how we are um sort of you could say like this new strength this new potential that's coming into christianity right at this moment yeah so yeah all right folks so i think i think we done enough talking about the crazy history of these of gag and magog so i appreciated everything is there a last thing you want to say richard before um yeah it's just uh i i think something i'd like to circle back on a little bit is in our previous video one of the things that you mentioned that that i think is worth really thinking about is uh and it relates to what you just said about strength encountering identity is that the most honest and sincere way to encounter the edge right is to is to fully embody the identity of the the thing that you belong to um as we uh you know many of your viewers are christians um and so i'll just speak to christians for a moment like as we are as we are encountering you know the monsters on the edge of the world this strange place of hybridity that we're moving into uh this influx of new converse to christianity which i am all for okay um this new this this conflict this this influx of new converts to christianity this influx of of new ways of i mean the internet itself the fact that you're listening this video on youtube guys that's a that's a weird thing right that's a that's a thing that's happening kind of you know the ways that the internet sort of functions as the as the end of the world right um as as we're doing all of this the the best thing that we can do the most powerful thing we can do um as we encounter all of these things at the edge is is not to like freak out or panic it's not to it's not to try to uh you know exclude other people from the gospel uh who really desire really need it because you know they're gonna lower the property value so to speak of our neighborhood things like this the most important thing that we can do is to fully embody christ right um is to and the way the way that we do this i mean this is the big paradox of christianity um is that you know christ says that you know at the last judgment we're going to stand before him and he's going to say hey why didn't you visit visit me when i was in prison right why didn't you feed me when i was hungry why didn't you clothe me when i was naked and we're gonna say lord we never encountered you in any of those situations because we weren't looking for you out there and so this is the thing as as we encounter this stuff we need to fully embody our identity as christians go to liturgy read the lives of the saints be a christian like us as thoroughly and as authentically as you can be because it's the only way that as we encounter the destructive forces uh of the culture around us that's the only way that we're going to kind of survive that and we might not survive it in terms of keeping the empires we've been trying to build for ourselves um but christianity always wins through martyrdom so all right everybody on that note thanks for your attention and uh we'll be back with more with more universal history very soon bye-bye this episode is part of a series of discussions i've had with richard roland on universal history you can find a list of all these episodes on my youtube channel where you can find them also in my podcast stream from the symbolic world on your different podcast platforms make sure to check out richard's second podcast which he hosts in collaboration with father andrew damick called amman sewell which looks at the relationship between tolkien and orthodoxy this podcast has also inspired me some ideas for creating some images whether it be the king under the mountain whether it be the grail or beautiful ethiopian traditions i've created some products which you can find on my store the symbolicworld.store and there will probably be more of those to come very soon so stay tuned this conversation is ongoing and there is still very much to explore in the universal history
