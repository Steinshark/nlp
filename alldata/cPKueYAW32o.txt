foreign [Music] Ty no I don't care about that I'm so tired of that hype no I'm telling you these are a big deal really if you don't pay attention and you don't start implementing them your job will probably be taken over okay I'm listening tell me more now in all seriousness this is a really big deal this announcement about being able to prompt more than just with text using images and also your voice and I'm going to share with you in this video exactly why that is how you can use these new features that are coming to chat GPT for learning how to code learning design really learning any technical or non-technical skill using these two different prompt methods and I really wanted to dive into this and make a video about it because as I was reading the news today seeing all the headlines come up as to how you can use these prompts for things such as fixing your bike or fixing things around the house it got me thinking you know what would be really interesting to to use this for is learning to code to learn ux UI design to learn these different skills in a visual way in a more interactive way it's no surprise we all learned so differently and I think it's we're going to see so quickly that the old way if you will of learning was just sitting there reading a piece of paper taking it in and then having to go from there now that is a great way and still super valuable but now with these new ways coming out that are more interactive and making it feel you have this personal one-on-one tutor I think people are going to be able to level up and upskill at a much quicker pace so let's get into it oh before we do hit that subscribe button for more Tech coding career related videos leave in the comments any other questions you have I will do my best to answer every single one of them you can hold me to that alright now let's get into it foreign the images I think are where we are going to see the biggest interaction as far as upskilling and learning quickly so let's save that to the end of this video or the the larger portion of this video and start with the boys interactions so what is so good about voice interactions as opposed to text well when we think about learning in a classroom learning with a tutor we are learning and interacting in a two-way format unlike where we are currently at with chat Bots where it's we are yes interacting and they are responding it still feels a little bit one-dimensional now with being able to have these voice conversations it makes it feel as though you can learn quicker by having more accurate conversations you can really what you say is going to differentiate as to what you type and a lot of us who are Learners that want to interact with others this is a great way to do so before we go any further though let's share a little clip of that Chad GPT shared or open AI shared about what this will be like and as a side note one thing that really I took me off guard or I noticed instantly was how much the voice in chat gbt sounds like an actual human I think it's really close to getting there what do you think let's take a listen in a pocket or under a tree oh where could my little Keys be I checked in the fridge behind the TV even the cat looked up up as if to plea they jingle they jangle they open the door always end up on a different floor I searched high and low left low left and right why must you vanish out of plain sight all right so let's hop into exactly what are some ideas that you can use this for and as a side note this is still rolling across subscriptions I'm a paid user so hopefully I will get access to this very soon but they say it's going to be rolling across the board equally soon so even if you're not a paid user you should receive this update very soon in the meantime though until we all get those updates let's go through some example prompts so when you do have that update you can easily start doing it let's say in this case you are learning JavaScript specifically react and for this you want to have a conversation a voice conversation with chat chpt on react through text it's kind of stagnant in the sense of you'd be like explain to me react like a 10 year old or whatever the case is that you want it to be explained to you like now you can be like like hey Chad GPT or whatever you want to call the chatbot that's weird hey Chet that was awkward you get what I'm saying though explain to me react in a few sentences that makes it really easy for me to understand I'm a student in computer science with this background and I have a little bit of trouble understanding technical things so make sure that it's easy to understand maybe at the level of say you were explaining it to a 10 year old a 15 year old whatever the case is but you can see how much more detailed I was able to get in such a quick amount of time versus using the text and I think that's one thing we will see is our prompts will become so much more accurate with this it feels much more human to be able to speak to this chatbot versus typing and I think a lot of us will feel that way and naturally it will make more of us in tune to becoming a prompt engineer I always say or I have said in the past that prompt engineering will probably turn not into a specific role but rather will evolve that everyone is a prompt engineer in a way that needs to learn just like we all have learned varying degrees how to Google especially as a developer or other roles you really hone in on that skill the same will be true for prompt engineering and now we are getting to a point where we can prompt engineer simply with our voice all right now let's get into the part we've all been waiting for or I've been waiting for which is inputting an image and prompting it that way VIA an image first though let's take a look at the demo that chat GPT shared I'm doing just this now you can see here on the demo they input about a bike they wanted some help fixing their bike and one thing that we will get to in this video is how they use it to specify ask a question based on Chad gpt's response so is this the lever and then sending an updated image of the lever or asking if it is also to note how they now have access to the draw tool so you can draw on these images for specifics if you are looking to point to part of an image or anything like that and this is really interesting this is what really got me excited when I was reading through the updates was using images now to interact with chat GPT mainly because I'm a very visual person but I want to share with you some ways that when we start thinking of how we can learn with images and chat GPT it really will open up your your eyes to the of possibilities picture this we are a designer and we have a figma file we've built this beautiful landing page right they're just in figma so we exported it as say we exported as a PDF or any kind of image format now what we can do is simply upload that image to chat GPT and let's say write code for me use JavaScript to build me this one pager from this image that is now possible that's wild also as a side note I feel like there's so many tools right now that turn figma into code that this might just completely wipe them all out I don't know what do you think that's one use case I thought was really interesting is enabling non-technical people to build faster with code and if they have an idea or an app that they want to build I'm not saying it can be production level ready of course not but what they can do is make a prototype now with this image prompting this is really breaking barriers another thing I thought was interesting was I like system design system architecture I like to geek out about I I just think it's super fascinating and there's so many layers to it so I was thinking what would be really interesting here is in chat GPT one of their plugins actually will create diagrams for you kind of like mermaid.js if you're familiar with that so we'll create this diagram of how systems work whether it be through technical or non-technical systems but let's say Technical Systems so maybe it is how is this website built and it goes through the different Frameworks and and systems used what you can now do with that image that is of a diagram is input it into chat GPT yes get it to explain it to you but also to really get it to interact with that image more so maybe it is something like build me a similar website using this architecture I don't know to me that just blows my mind just with that single prompt the possibility so once again these aren't you know through this one prompt we're not going to get Enterprise ready websites what we are going to get is a really great starting point which will allow for so many more people to build new businesses come up with new ideas feel more unable to build and learn quickly so how is this going to affect your job today let's talk a little bit about that well we've seen now more than ever how AI is continuing to grow at such a fast rate and gone are the days where we can just kind of push it off and think that yeah whatever it's not a big deal or this is super hyped the hype is here to stay it's continuing to go faster and faster so once this is available I really encourage you to Tinker around with it build with it try using it to learn something new through the ways I shared with you use it to lean on for a project you're working on obviously don't use this at work unless your company or business that you work for has given you permission to I think that goes without saying but the possibilities with this update really can expand our learning to the next level all right I'm curious to hear what do you want to learn with these new updates leave in the comments and if you haven't already hit that subscribe button for more Tech coding career AI you know all the good stuff uh related topics and I will see you soon all right let's get
