ladies and gentlemen welcome back to day two of Advent of code an adventure that I will likely regret where we choose a new language every day to do the Advent of code challenge in if I get the challenge wrong on the first try chat gets to replace one of these languages here on my magical wheel with the language of their choosing I made that rule up yesterday on the spot and I'm already like I can like all the comments on the YouTube video yesterday were oh hll brain Ada for TR like the minute I start to get this wrong it's going to be a disaster let's get started here we're we're going to spin the wheel we got a couple good ones I replaced C++ yesterday with rust I really want to get rust on the board I want to do some Rust challenges I want to get a little bit better with rust so let's spin this wheel chat are we ready to go let's get let's get rolling oh no oh no PHP okay um Jesus Christ sometimes in life you do things that you don't necessarily think through and like I kind of put PHP on here as a meme to myself I kind of forgot about it so Advent of code day two in PHP this was such a mistake I'm I'm already regretting this so the issue is I need to actually like install PHP I think thinks okay so I have engine X so we just need to do engine X PHP dude if this is more than like a oneliner I'm going to cry Docker image yeah I might just do that beautiful all right cool so in theory now if we go here if I do like Echo AO are we good perfect okay we're winning we're cooking with oil let's go ahead and read the challenge now so if you're not familiar with Advent of code every day we have a challenge where we have to help the elves through some kind of predicament in their you know attempt to fix some kind of problem problem so the issue is that there's no snow we are trying to figure out how to help the elves make snow we do that by collecting stars and doing challenges so day two Cube conundrum so yesterday they put us into a trebuchet and they launched us into the sky so here we are you launched High into the atmosphere the Apex of your trajectory just barely reaches the surface of a large island floating in the sky oh that's interesting you gently land on a fluffy pile of leaves it's quite cold but you don't see much snow unfortunate an elf runs over to greet you hey elf what's going on the elf explains you've arrived at Snow Island and apologizes for the lack of snow he'll be happy to explain the situation but it's a bit of a walk so you have some time as you walk the elf shows you a small bag and some cubes which are either red green or blue each time you play the game he will hide a secret number of cubes of each color in the bag okay so we said red green blue cubes he puts in the bag great and your goal is to figure out information about the number of Cubes to get information once a bag has been loaded with cubes the elf will reach into a bag grab a handful of random cubes show them to you and put them back in the bag we'll do this a few times per game you play several games and record the information from each game your puzzle input so each game is listed with its ID number game one for example like the 11 in game 11 okay so we to figure out how to parse the string in PHP followed by a semicolon separated list of subsets of Cubes that were revealed from the bag like three red five green four blue okay so three red four four red okay this is one game and these are the r random showings that we have the elf would first like to know which games would have been possible if the bag had only contained 11 or 12 red cubes 13 green cubes and 14 blue cubes in the example above Games 1 and two would have been possible or 1 two and five would have been possible if the bag have been loaded with that configuration okay this is literally just a a game in string parsing so determine which games would have been possible if the bag had been loaded with only 12 red cubes 13 green cubes and 14 blue cubes what is the sum of the IDS of those games okay so effectively the solution here is going to be read for every line Parts the string into parts so we have the split off the colon space part that gets us the game section and the data section and within that split off of the semicolon space and we could do this in Rex God damn it this is okay so this isn't even a PHP challenge this is a redx challenge oh dear God okay so let's go to reder real quick quick if you haven't used red xer before huge tool really powerful in making rxes this was not a good idea all right I really really really really really really really really don't want to do Reax do file equals day 2.txt we'll do this um we'll get our puzzle actually we're going to start with this one right um so someone have been eight for this okay let's do this we'll do day two and we'll go over here to our AOC day2 and we Vim um day 2.txt this will be our our sample input right so let's make sure that our PHP still runs okay so we have a 500 internal error wonderful it's file get contents underscore I see file get contents file read contents have this no more 500 error perfect um so this is not file this is file data uh we could do Echo perfect okay lines equals explode file data on new line so to iterate over an array in PHP it's for each line as the reference to lines and we'll do instead of echo file data we'll do ECHO line perfect oh string separator and then the string that's that's pretty bad um beautiful okay so we have that split and now we're splitting the so now let's do ECHO line and then Echo new line has to be BR you're right cuz we're using it's rendering as HTML cool all right there we go claps in chat so we're now we're opening the file let's go also I got to chill cuz my son's room who's a baby by the way uh is like right upstairs if I'm too loud that poor kid will wake up at 700 in the morning on a Saturday so only 4 months he starts learning rust his first language will be HTML okay we'll get them we'll get them a little little HTML for babies so we have this line right and the syntax is game n colon space 3x 4 Y game equals line v no no no no cuz for some reason the splitter is the first part so we're going to explode the line the colon space and then we'll do um explode the line and its index Zero game one perfect God I have the fact that I have to put HTML in my solution like this is a like I'm I'm not happy about dude th this is going to be disgusting more and more I might be considering doing Rex but like cuz what I'm going to have to do now is do explode uh into space this and then take this the first if element okay so I mean I have this but like look at this this is a disaster this is really bad ah it's so gross no this this is a Rex challenge I have to I have to do a Rex some repeating amount of these groups D and then it's going to be a white space character and then it's going to be one of either green or blue or red wait do you even have a valid red EX no I don't um let's see so I need these groups I need this and then this okay so we're going to iterate over every line okay okay okay okay and we'll do um PR match pattern subjects which I'm already feeling like is going to not work let's see boom boom boom line and the matches go into aha okay is this correct wonderful and then let's do can we Echo an array is that like allowed in PHP I think it's the new line that's making it sad can I do what is it like G three blue four red this dude all right we're we're just going to go the explode route I'm over it I'm good okay so rounds equals explode by colon space the game I'm good NOP thank you no thanks Rex I could have been done by now if I didn't go the Rex route I swear to God holy okay good three blue four red boom boom boom okay so now we're going to do four each rounds as round Echo round and then Echo bur round one round two round three wonderful and then you do cubes equals explode by comma space and then for each uh Echo Cube much easier so game one we have three blue four red we have one red two green six blue we have two green wonderful okay so going back to the whole point of this what we have to do is walk the amount of Cubes that are each color in every game and if these numbers are above at any given point the maximum amount so it was 12 red 13 green 14 blue so we got to create some Global variables here we'll say Max red equals what is it 12 Max Green = 13 we'll do Max Blue equal 14 cool so we have each Cube and then now we have to split again po equals explode by space the cube of one and then number equals explode by space I'm going to get so much flame for this in the chat but like or in the YouTube comments but I I don't give a and then we'll say how do I cast to an INT uh int to or stir to in PHP this feels like C type casting though this is really bad my God so we'll do this we'll do Echo numb wonderful wonderful guys we're having a blast we're having a good time all right three 3 2 2 1 one wonderful if stir compare if not stir compare color to red and numb is greater than Max Red game possible equals false great take this we're going to copy this we're cooking let me cook let me cook I refuse to touch PHP yeah I agree dude uh blue num ma greater than Max blue and then green gra number than Max Green okay what do we got 500 error perfect okay that's what I wanted oh oh oh oh oh guys guys if not C yeah I had the paren in the wrong spot total sum equals z no not double equals equals z so now if this is possible we do um total sum plus equals game num and I have to cast this to an in int of explode perfect so we'll do this zero still possible yep good Echo no we won't Echo AO we are going to Echo total sum all right ladies and GS here's a deal things are about to get weird are are we confident no one's oh my God the nose are okay now we're evening up part two in each game played what is the fewest number of cubes of each color that could have been in the bag to make the game possible in this one there could have been as few as six blue two green four red the power of a set of Cubes equal to the number of Red Green and blue multiplied by each other the power of the minimum set of the cubes in the game is 48 426 there we go okay give a little stretch so what we have to do here effectively is just track the the maximum number uh Min red equals z Min green equals 0 Min blue equal 0 um if color equals green and num is greater than Min green Min green equals num we literally just copy this we'll do RGB red blue power equals Min red time Min Green Time Min blue total sum plus equals power and then I'm going to have my day two input we'll change this from day two to Vim sample.txt CU I don't want to mess this up go to slart 2. PHP great oh like that boom sweet okay 2286 is that the answer for this okay so this is the correct answer for the sample.txt here we go okay so in theori that's that's the answer I got a lot of Believers okay dude if I get this wrong the the doubters are going to cash out 10,000 on yes and only 400 on no zero points for you well you got to hang out here man and get me get yourself some points all right here we go guys woo let's go let's go we won this day first try normally I would replace the wheel myself but stand by real quick I'm going to choose but chat will have the opportunity to suggest answers uh I'm going to erase PHP cuz I refuse to ever do that again that was horrible um let's see Elixir Elixir Mojo o camel ladies and germs we are adding Elixir to the wheel whe as an input from chat if you suggest hascal or brain I will I will just ban you Advent of code day two in the books little bit of PHP I didn't mind PHP the language so much I M Mound I mounded minded um Rex Rex ain't it if you're ever doing stuff and you feel like you need Rex just don't just split parse split parse and you're all good portability of your code the ability for someone else to read your code and adapt it later on that all you need to do is explode your strings and go on from there so if you enjoyed this video hang out with me tomorrow on day three and we'll see you in the next one take care
