- Can I have one double cheeseburger? Ew, this is disgusting. Can I have a double cheeseburger? Can I just have a double cheeseburger? McDonald's, you better be at least decent. Why? Why do they all suck? This tastes like crap. Can I have a double cheeseburger? Hardee's, please don't let me down. I swear this burger doesn't taste good. It sucks too. Jesus, I hate this burger. There's only one logical thing to do. We're here in North Carolina. In-N-Out is a fast food restaurant that's only in California. So, we're gonna drive from
North Carolina all the way to California to get In-N-Out Burger because every other burger sucks. Would you rather drive five
minutes for an F burger or drive 50 hours there
and then 50 hours back, but have a good burger. I think the answer's pretty simple. - Heck yeah, I'll ditch my
family for a week for a burger. Heck yeah.
- Heck yeah. Also you're gonna wanna watch to the end because I'm actually eating In-N-Out with a YouTuber who has
more subscribers than me. I already called him up and
we have it all planned out. It's been a couple hours and we are at gas station stop number one. - Gotta get those red bulls. - Yeah, we're feeling kind of,
oh, that's a creepy person. So, we just finished with our first stop. Everyone got red bulls. Hopefully we don't fall asleep and die. I'd rather see how many
views this video gets. I mean, it would get more views if I died, but I mean, I don't know. Being alive would be nice. - Tennessee. You're the only 10 I see. Actually, I can't see you. You're like black right now. - We've been waiting for this gas station to open for like 10 minutes. It's 5:00 AM. - Hey, viewers. I'm so tired. I want a nap. - While Chris naps, we
are actually in Kentucky. - You suck. - So, we got a little
distracted at the hotel and we ended up in a hot, hey! - Hello. - Hey Chris, what were
you doing down there? - Little stuff.
- Okay. So yeah, we got a little
sidetracked in oh, there's Garrett as well. Yeah, we all ended up in a hot tub. - All right, men. You're ready to go to California. - Jimmy, are you? Hey, Hey Dave, me and
my creep are having fun. Do you mind?
- What is all this minecraft? That's inappropriate, that's creeper porn. - And you're cuddling with a dude in your Minecraft bed? Whoa, I'm gonna get outta here. - All right, guys. So, we're back on the road. We had to stop and give
my 5 million subscriber, 5 million pieces of popcorn which is why this trip's actually gonna
take a really long time because we have to go north and now we gotta go
back south-ish to Cali. I'm not gonna act like I
know what I'm talking about. We're gonna follow the GPS. As you can see, we have about a day and four hours until we hit California. So, we were driving down
the road and we saw a tank. You guys don't know this, but I've been trying to get
a tank for over a month. There's this one video idea
that I really wanna do. And literally for the last 30 days, we've been calling everyone we can find that privately owns a tank
and offering them 10 grand to let us use it for a video. But no one said yes. Hey, so can we buy one of those tanks? We kind of of need it for a viral video. - Well, I don't think you could buy it, but you talk to the owner
and see what they say. - Yes, perfect. Chris, that's the portal the aliens are gonna use to kill us. - Wow, look at that beautiful arch there. - Honestly, I don't
think the viewers care. - I think they would. - Do you care? Do you guys really, here, come see this arch right here viewers. Do you really care about this arch? Does this really make work? It's not. - I thought it was beautiful.
- Bad Chris. Everyone said bad Chris. They don't care about the arch. - Fine. - How dare you show them an arch? No, you're our arch nemesis now. They don't care about the arch. Good to see that, I apologize. Fun story. We were just eating at
a Mexican restaurant and we left our camera there. This is camera number two. - Mr. Beast! - What's up man? Hey, it's your long lost brother camera. Thank you man. We found the camera boys. - Camera, camera, camera, camera. - Hop in man, we gotta go to California. - Yeah!
- Let's go. - So, we're in Kansas. And this is a normal
burger, not from In-N-Out. Watch. Even the Kansas road sign
doesn't like normal burgers. That's what we wanted. Fun challenge, floss
on the side of the road until someone honks at you. And if you die, it's also not my fault. Welcome to colorful Colorado. I'd get out, but it's currently 3:51 AM. Chris. What are you doing there buddy? - Thinking about life,
if I like it or not. - We're just going 70 miles an hour with the door open. Yeah, it's convenient.
- Feels good. - Hey Jimmy.
- Yeah. - What do we do in tunnels? - Unsee it. All right, we're at Denny's. Tyler drove us through the night. We're almost in California. Let's go get some breakfast. Look how many bugs we murdered as we were crossing the country. Like, holy crap. So, we just entered New Mexico. And for those of you who
saw my Uber video, yes, I didn't know it was a state back then, but I know it's a state now. I apologize, guys. And to show how sorry I am for not knowing you guys are a state, I put money inside this burger which isn't an In-N-Out burger, which means it's a piece of crap. Whoa, for everyone's money, go get it. Wrong day to wear flip flops. - Wrong day to wear shorts. - I got hit by cactus.
- Me too. - My leg is covered in cactus. We were filming a skit on
that mountain over there and we saw a coyote,
and we started running. And I ran straight into a cactus. It didn't feel good. I'm still pulling them out my leg. It kind of hurts. Chris, my brother we've come a long way. - We have.
- And we're almost at that In-N-Out. We are in California,
home to In-N-Out Burger. This is the last non In-N-Out
burger I will ever touch. Be gone thought. - Oh, you hit that bush there. - Yeah, it reminded me of the cactus. I'm like still bleeding. - Do you wanna see how close we are to dying all the time? - Yeah, we're literally on
the side of the highway. Watch this. God, it's so close. So, where are we Garrett? - We're in California.
- We're in LA. What time is it? Our time, Chris. - 4:30 AM.
- Precisely. We're tired, we're gonna go to bed. - Too tired, I've been
driving for two hours. - We got in at 2:00 AM last night and obviously all In-N-Outs were closed. But they're open now and
we're gonna go get our burger. 3000 miles, we're so stupid. - No, it's worth it, always worth it. They're more stupid
for watching the video. - Dumb viewers. - We're at the great In-N-Out. - Looks like there's a
bunch of people in there. You think they drove 3000 miles for it? In-N-Out, we drove 3000
miles to go eat a burger at this In-N-Out. It better be a rare, super tasty burger like we've been told. We drove 3000 miles for an In-N-Out burger which is only available on the west coast. - And Texas but we found that out later. - Yeah, and Arizona. So, yeah Chris, 3000 miles,
an entire week of our lives. Let's take a bite. Is this rare burger better
than all the other burgers? Tastes just like every other burger. - It's just a burger man. - Yeah, oh, what's up H3? - What's going on? - So, we got In-N-Out and it's
just not really that great. I don't,
- Really? - Yeah. I don't know what to do. - I usually always like it.
- Yeah? - Dude, mine tastes terrible. What'd you do?
- I know what the problem is. - What's the problem, man? They undersalt it.
- Really? - And you just sprinkle
a little salt on it. - Oh, oh, that's a lot of, okay. - I'm a man of salt. Imma hit that? - Yeah, let me hit that. - See that?
- That's perfect. It's like a fine powder. - Wow!
- I got you. - I really feel my
tongue burning right now. - Right? But it's good. It's exciting. - Brings tears to my eyes. - Every little cut I had on my tongue, is just on fire now. - Right, but it's thrilling. It's like a,
- Yeah. - That's real. It really brings out the meat. - Maybe you didn't get
enough the first time. - My eyes quite aren't watery yet. This here will seal the deal.
- Nice. - I'm quite terrified to do this, but I gotta go along with the joke. - Here you go. This is not a joke. Oh wow, oh yeah.
- This is so good. - That looks so good right now. I'm super excited to take a bite of this really salty burger. - Just hit right over the
grill, that's the biggest thing. - Tastes like heart disease. - Yeah, it does. - So good. - I'm glad we drove 3000 miles for this and I'm glad we met you because without you this 3000 miles, would've been for nothing.
- Really? - We would've thought the burger was bad. - Oh, I'm glad I just ran
into you in this parking lot because this is the best burger. - And that's what LA's all about. There's just so many YouTubers. You just like, see 'em just like, it's even better if you get the salt. By getting salt on you, that just adds to the flavor. Thanks, man. I didn't realize like having salt on my leg would make
my burger taste better. Like, I need a little more salt. It just wasn't good enough. - More salt?
- Yeah. Just let here all out, yeah. I wanna die in my sleep tonight. That'd be great. - I don't have diabetes medicine, but I feel like I need it. - Yeah, same. - You wanna enjoy your burger or not? You drove here from the east coast. You might as well enjoy it for grace sake. - That's looking like
the mighty good burger. I'm gonna bite right there
where all that salt is 'cause I want maximum flavor. - Oh, God.
- Nice. Good.
- Yeah, there it is. - Really good, right? Really, really good.
- It's very tasty. I'm finding the back of the tears boys. - Yeah. - I think it's time we bully H3 though. Since, we can't get on his podcast, we're just gonna question him here. - Yeah, you're about to get podcasted. - I'm getting podcasted. - We had a very important question. This is something we deal with. - Every day. - We both have micro penises and we know you have one as well. - Yeah.
- So we just like, how do you deal with that? I get a lot of comments
of people being like, how's your dick so small. Like, that doesn't even make sense. - They say that to you.
- Yeah, a lot of them. It's really annoying. So like, how do you deal with it? - You use your hip really, you know. - Motion of the ocean, right? - You got, I mean, my gut
sticks out further than my cup. - Nice.
- So, you gotta work that. You know what I mean?
- So, it draws attention away from it is what you're saying. - No, but like when you're having sex, you gotta create friction somehow, right? The dick's not doing it. - I'm following.
- So, you get in there. That's actually very useful information. - You're skinny.
- Yeah. - That's not good. - So, I gotta get fuller. - You guys are too skinny. - Honestly, this is such good advice. I kind of need to write it down. So, - Write this down. And the other thing it does is good is that when your fat starts
folding over the cock. - They can't even see it. - They don't even know.
- They can't even judge you. - And by the time that you're
like, oh, we're in bed, we're having sex.
- What are they gonna do? Walk away?
- Yeah. Oh, oh, your dick's too small. I'm getting outta bed. Yeah, right. Got ya, that's what I say to 'em. - Gotcha. - They're like, where's your dick? And I'm like, got 'em. - All right, gain some weight
to help mass tiny dick. - Got it.
- Exactly. - Dude, that made this all worth it. - Nice man. - We should drive 3000 miles
for sex advice next time. - I'm here, I'm here. Anytime dude, I'm here. - So, I just like to point
out that we kidnapped him and put him in a van to eat burgers and talk about dicks with us. - It was actually a fake taxi. He doesn't know it, but
there's a lot cameras and, - We're in a tank right now. - Yeah. So, we've just casually
been sitting in this car, just staring at the scenery. - And dealing with
shredder, another YouTuber in the parking lot, what
are the chances of that? - Wow, this seems to be so normal. - What are the chances of that? - We're gonna zoom in on your dog. Oh, yeah. That's also another cool thing. If you want YouTubers
to hang out with you, you just gotta give him a free burger. Like, here you go, man. - I mean, he just DMed
me and he's like, dude, you want some In-N-Out? And I was like, just fucking
tell me when and where. - Yeah, exactly.
- Whatever you want. - That's actually exactly how it went. - I don't take shit man. Free In-N-Out. - We tried to make the world's
largest baking soda volcano. And it started raining. - Did you never get to film it? - Well we did, but we scraped it. Here, let's use that footage here. World's largest baking soda volcano. - Whoa, that was insane.
- I know, right? - That was so crazy. How
did that, unbelievable. - That was like dude, the explosion and yeah, it was crazy.
- I fell. - Wow. - Yeah, cut to when Chris
fell off the volcano. That was pretty funny. Hopefully, we say goodbye to H3 before he burns alive in a car. - Yeah, yeah. Well I appreciate you coming down and feeding my homeless ass with a burger. - I appreciate getting invited
on that podcast, I mean. - Well, you didn't get me, you let me know like one day. I need some time to plan, you know? I wanna do your ass service. - Yeah. - You're gonna have to drive back to LA. - All right. I guess we have to drive back just to be in the podcast later. - Thanks for the burger dog. I was really hungry, So, I definitely appreciated that. - I drove 3000 miles for it. - Thanks man. - Nice meeting you.
- Nice meeting you. So, enjoy the yeet and, - He really likes the word yeet. Can you please say that
in the future video? So everyone watching this, just. - Just to know that it was you. - Yeah. - All right, bye guys. - Bye. - Thanks for the burger.
- Yeah. - Chris, Chris, I can't believe we just met H3. - It's literally insane.
- Oh, my God. - He even acknowledged my micro penis too. - That's crazy.
- Had a lot of fun. - What's the homeless man back? - Yeah, he's coming back. - I noticed you guys have like a bag of a, - Yeah, this one? - Yeah, are you guys gonna eat these? I noticed there was some
fries and burgers in here. - Oh, didn't you eat like two burgers. - Yeah, but I mean, if you
guys aren't eating 'em. - Yeah, yeah. - Okay, I guess you could have 'em. - Yeah, you don't wanna
waste food on camera, right? - Yeah.
- I don't wanna waste food. - You're working on the
micro penis, hiding it. Yeah, yeah.
- Okay, so this is all good? - Yeah, man.
- Yeah, all right. - Okay.
- Have fun in mixing it. - Thanks again for the burgers, all right. - Chris, you got a really nice shoe. Look at that. - Our shoe game is on point. - I got the Gucci shoe.
- I got Eazy's and Guccis. - Yeah.
- Shoe game is, - Wow, oh my goodness, dude. - That's insane. - Guys, comment who
has the nice shoe game. Honestly,
- I mean, I don't want 'em to, I'm gonna lose, - I'm done shoving a camera in your face. We're about the head into In-N-Out. As you know, like we're
both super famous, you know, like, we're gonna get kicked out. - It's gonna be chaotic. - Yeah, last time you went in wasn't there like, a swarm of people around you? - The police are gonna be coming. There's gonna be a lot of chaos. - I'm ready. - Pandemonium.
- It's gonna be fun. - It's not really gonna work
out but let's give it a shot. - I think we're gonna get arrested. There's just gonna be so
many people following. - It's a hazard, really. I shouldn't do it, but for
the video, we'll check it out. - I don't think anybody's
recognized you guys yet. - I think that guy. - Nah, I don't think that's happening. - Mr. Beast? - No, no. - No, it is not Mr. Beast. ♪ Mr. Beast oh! ♪ ♪ Mr. Beast oh! ♪ ♪ Mr. Beast oh! ♪
