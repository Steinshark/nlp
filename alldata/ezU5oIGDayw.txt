passwords suck even if you have a password manager to help you keep track of the dozens of credentials you're probably using they come with quite a few problems other than simply being hard to remember secure passwords can still be hacked as they aren't always stored in a secure Manner and even if they are passwords can and do get stolen by a social engineering like when a scammer calls up your poor old grandma oh hello and security concerns aside the whole song and dance of having to create a password in the first place can actually lead users to just give up on using a service altogether especially if it doesn't have that sign in with Google or sign in with apple button available as an option and obviously Services you sign up for want your business and aren't exactly thrilled when a user walks away so it shouldn't be surprising that pass keys are starting to become more common these are credentials that allow you to access an online account without a password to use a pass key you still need to authenticate that it's actually you trying to use it but instead of a big long silly word you use a fingerprint sensor or facial recognition or a QR code or pin which are useful if you're on a device like a desktop PC that might not have biometric recognition Hardware of course you have to remember a pin which does negate one of the advantages of pasis but Biometrics are already extremely common on phones and laptops and can be cheaply added to a desktop but regardless of the authentication method pass keys are stored in a different way than traditional passwords which is one of their main selling points in terms of security we'll tell you exactly how that works right after we thank secret lab with their Black Friday Cyber Monday sale coming to an end secret lab said why not just keep the savings going that's how they sound their holiday sale is live now and you can save up to 150 bucks on shares like their illustrious Titan Evo with his Dynamic lumbar support and four-way adjustable armrests or save up to $100 off their desks like the premium and versatile Magnus Pro check out the sale out the link below and save big this holiday season instead of hanging out on a server somewhere pass Keys live right on your device but if that's the case how does the server know that you're giving it the correct credential when you try to connect the answer is public key cryptography essentially the same basic idea that underpins most of the encryption you find on the web we have another video with more details on cryptography but the gist of it is this the website or application you're connecting to stores a special string of characters called a public key and the key that stays on your device is a private key the public key is useless on its own but when the key pair is verified as correct you're granted access baby bingo the cryptographic algorithm that generates the keys is nearly impossible to reverse so if someone breaks into the server and steals the public key it's very unlikely that they'd somehow be able to figure out your private key unless they have a quantum computer or something pass Keys also don't need to use multiactor authentication involving those numerical codes that you have to copy and paste unlike a password-based system a bad actor would physically need access to your device to get into your account if you're using a pass key this means that the second factor for a pass key is effectively your fingerprint your face or your PIN which you're already using to sign in anyway of course this doesn't mean that pass keys are absolutely secure for example someone could set up a weak pin misplace their phone and suddenly it's quite easy for a bad actor to get into a huge number of their accounts but the point isn't absolute security as that is isn't truly achievable instead the goal is to make your accounts easier to access and more secure than they are with traditional passwords both at the same time and seeing as how way too many of us are still using passwords like Cy the companies that are pushing pass Keys might just be on to something so thanks for watching guys if you like this video maybe watch that other video on cryptography or switch it up how about why are planes white it's a great one
