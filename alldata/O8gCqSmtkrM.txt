this is one sad man he was just one week outside of the three-year warranty period for his monitor when this happened yeah look at that the panel seems to be fine but there's something going on in the brains of this little guy that's causing it to power cycle all day long now he could just go out and buy a new one but that's going to cost about 300 US Dollars and besides this one's already broken what's the worst that could happen if we tried to fix it oh I mean it's already broken maybe right here actually great deals on AMD ryzen processors and AMD Radeon graphics cards are yours for the taking including amazing game bundles for a limited time from June 5th to July 1st check them out of the link below tell me what happened uh yeah it was just power cycling I woke up in the morning it would just do this for a while it would do the whole logo at first right and then it kept getting worse and worse and worse I just turn it off unplug it plug it back in hey it would work I did that for about a week okay so then what you're telling me is that you're a week out of warranty and you knew about this for a week before you contacted anyone some of you that actually just uh yeah cool always consult a doctor as soon as your symptoms develop friends well one way or another you're out of warranty now which means we need to fix it ourselves now in a perfect world we'd get replacement parts directly from the manufacturer but unfortunately Asus like many other manufacturers doesn't really stock replacement parts for their older devices so it's off to eBay pick click yeah pick click that's great where we're going to run into another Asus problem this is super cool the just the density of these results is amazing yeah don't you hate searching through eBay and you got to sort through all the parts like yeah it takes forever to find the thing you actually want a valve index uh clip uh Cable cable clip I need a cable clip I lost my cable clip for my index genuine OEM valve index cable clip replacement for back of headset that's the one I need wow the system works oh it opens in a new tab oh because of course it does because it's a really well designed web so they know you're going to want to click like five tabs of these things this is kind of awesome all right anyway Let's uh actually get back to your monitor but it doesn't save us from that Asus problem I mentioned some of their products uh laptops for instance have part numbers that differ only by the last couple of characters to indicate a different internal configuration but for the same model of product for monitors on the other hand we've got results for the vg27aq that's what we have and also the vg278q1a which is a completely different product if we bought a replacement board from that one and tried to put it in here that would not work so even if Asus support can't sell you a replacement part I would suggest contacting them for some guidance to ensure you don't order the wrong thing for our part though we managed to find this replacement board for really 50 bucks shipped yeah not bad there's some other ones on here that are like 112 So I think we actually saved a bit of money yeah that's awesome I mean it's used so who knows how long it's going to last but personally for that price I'd rather take my chances than wait the months that Asus quoted us to get a new part yeah really it came packed like this yep used parts I really hope this works anyway this should be everything we need a main board with low voltage differential signaling speakers and oh I guess there's the daughter board for the joystick controller at the front of the monitor as well so you've got everything there yeah yeah it's basically a full replacement because I don't know which part exactly in the chain is busted so we just got it all okay well let's crack open the existing monitor from the back where there's like no protective anything to hey look at this this looks kind of like the same size as this okay I couldn't help noticing this is quite is that is that how this was taped in here yeah huh that's a monitor for you you know it's a little less impressive when you look at the inside hey wait no no it's actually like this yeah it's actually like this we did open it up to take a look at it and everything so it has been opened before but yes it was legitimately mounted with tape like this angle yeah yeah okay because I've opened a fair number of monitors in the past I've never seen one that was mounted at an angle sometimes they look a little better than this yeah but it's at an angle for the rest of the case right you see how these two HDMI ports here they're at an angle on this side or this side I can't remember but yeah exactly because we got to replace all these ribbon cables oh uh oh we only have three second yeah we only got three ribbon cables well I really oh they're labeled okay so cn1 I have two two and this is three so hopefully cn4 Works yep I sure hope it does that that's a lot of ribbons between the main board and the panel I don't think I've seen that many before 1440p 165hz right yeah it does do HDR but I'm pretty sure it's just single panel uh you know there's no actual full array local dimming so I'm not sure why it's got so many ribbon cables are we even going to bother replacing the joystick in the menu buttons I don't think so it's it's probably fine without it yeah let's do it you know let's do everything else see if it works if it doesn't then hey we know what the problem is I see some manufacturing schmoo on here but there's nothing that's obviously just shorted or popped or anything like that the new one looks cleaner which is nice I guess but that also has manufacturing yeah not as much though now this is interesting you're getting a new revision of the board oh you're getting rev a11 instead of a00 that's a huge upgrade is it I don't know do we know that this new board works even uh not yet okay so it could be more broken than it was to start with you never know neat we should probably replace this guy too really what does that guy do uh I don't know maybe probably power supply yeah and you know what if it's power cycling I'm kind of concerned that it's part of the power supply is the issue okay what's going on here because the DC in comes in on this board but I don't see anything resembling a power supply yeah and it doesn't connect uh connect to this guy I mean it's got this cable here like way over here why don't we do one thing one thing on why don't we figure out what the actual problem was why don't we just try a new power supply to start okay so original board dupe you're not gonna short the board out or anything yeah don't worry about it I mean but it's what it's going to get more dead okay Power if it breaks at this point this is on you hold on hold on no no you were here supervising ah it was your responsibility to stop me yeah but this was your idea yeah it's uh no it's still flickering okay still power cycling let's replace Parts one at a time then okay I kind of like the idea of trying this new power supply here yeah if there's anything that has failed it's my money is on the power supply um just because it's a weird power cycling thing it's not like I suddenly lost you know an input or it just doesn't do the OSD navigation or anything like that so and if there's anything that I've learned in all my years doing this it's that if a problem is unpredictable or uh flaky yeah it's Ram or power supply yeah and this doesn't have Ram so ready to try this yeah okay and Power no still wrecked let me yeah it just power cycled a couple times yeah all right well it was worth at least exploring because think about it this way even if we weren't able to buy one individual part for our repair if we determined that hey it was only the power supply that was dead you can resell this and maybe recoup some of our costs well yeah but yeah off my cost yeah yeah exactly that's what I'm saying and that and I suspect you could get more than 20 bucks for this just because it's a standalone part good luck looking for it yeah exactly and it's the main part yes your board after we've done this if it's still messed up then maybe it is a cable oh yeah I guess that's true not a loose connection but maybe one of them is just shorting out for whatever reason yeah just bad because that's the other thing that often goes wrong if it's not Ram or power supply we spend like an hour and a half troubleshooting uh busted cable I can't wait until we make our own cables oh yeah like yeah that's that's happened to me at least like two or three times on different videos so I can't imagine how many other times this happened to other people too oops so that's the new power supply Pro tip put a little Sharpie Mark oh yeah or just you know put them somewhere completely different from the space where you're working just mark them yeah I press the button nothing's happening really it's not power cycling or anything uh you made it more dead no that's not possible but it's gonna get more dead did you put the old power supply in yeah okay look I gotta try stuff at this point yeah I mean maybe we maybe we had it switched switch the cables out maybe you broke one of the ribbon cables with all the finagling as possible it's possible I really don't think so don't worry very confident right now uh I'm trouble getting that in there no no no okay highly highly confident right now he's gonna be like the camera fixing video no nothing will ever be like that again yeah luckily we're not trying to bake anything in the oven you must bring up every one of my past failures who do you think you are my wife here we go big moment pretty cool um we've done a full replace you guys saw everything okay you know what okay here's what we're gonna do we're gonna replace literally we're gonna we're gonna go back to the original board for a second here God hold on hold on we're gonna see if it power Cycles sure because then we know whether it's the board or something or maybe it's maybe it's the installation maybe I got some of those funky cables kind of mixed around or something I'll take this off please tell me it at least power Cycles please so it's not doing anything are you kidding okay is this plugged in I checked that earlier that was one of the first things I looked at the squid should still be on we can change it to a different port if you want it's going right here no I believe you but like yeah we haven't done anything just us okay what I don't know I don't understand I don't either man what is even the purpose of this channel hey you should DIY repair your stuff don't worry it's really easy oh my God it's lighting up okay lights up those old board yeah it's power cycling okay yeah it's power cycling for sure okay we're back where we started hell yeah should we just try it again yeah oh we got light this time full disclosure we went through a whole thing with this thing where it seems dead um we were not getting a light oh I got an OSD input selection wait really yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you wanna look why so we've got the new power supply the new board yep and we're good yeah it's yeah we should probably plug in HDMI okay to make sure it fully works I am not letting myself believe that this is actually fixed yet but I know I don't seem I don't seem very excited right now 100 percent 100 and now what we just tape this yeah we do yeah this is bizarre this is where the vase amount goes into it's not screwed on I gotta put Gap tape over top of that just for some added rigidity great but Gaff tape is going to do anything you know it takes a gooey tape probably not but it makes me feel slightly more comfortable slightly while he's putting that together why don't we talk about one of the jargony terms that I was throwing around earlier I said this is an lvds board lvds stands for low voltage differential signaling and it's a communication standard that's created to help deal with electromagnetic interference or emi emi can degrade the signal to the point of malfunctioning so this lvds is typically used in computer buses and video data transfer including on LCD displays there are a few reasons that it's used over other signaling standards it provides a more scalable approach to voltage easily adapting to small Supply voltages while maintaining signal Integrity the voltage compliance is doubled because it's not limited to a single ended output and the output current remains constant which simplifies design and reduces overall cost which as we know is I pretty much everything is designed to the way that it is that's why we assembled it with tape speakers even if they weren't I don't need the speakers all that much oh you listed it up before I hit it no no you got to put it down when you hit it yeah yeah okay he's not stressed look at him you can tell he's not stressed now hold on a second you already replaced this thing did I just refurbish it so that you can sell it no I'm not gonna sell it I'm gonna use it I've currently got a little 24 inch 1080p 60 monitor for keyboard streams for monitoring chat and stuff and um you're going to use 144hz gaming monitor for monitoring chat yeah I'll put a vertical you know how much you're making everyone's brain hurt right now right why by holding like this no by using this to monitor chat you know it's gonna look really good Starving Children could have eaten this game well that's true you know what maybe at the very least I'll sell the old 1080p 60 that it's going to replace for basically free I'll give it away to somebody look at that it works does it yeah are you sure okay plug-in a it does incredible there you go Jesus we found it incredible at last they don't have to search anymore I I'm never gonna get tired of that joke yeah that's pretty good and I'm never gonna get tired of telling you about our sponsor
