people feel like they can't speak their minds the Millennials are just saddled in debt we have a system in which H or a third of American colleges produce graduating classes in which the median graduate makes less than the average high school graduate like who can blame young [Music] people hello everyone watching and listening today I'm speaking with Greg lucoff and Ricky Schlott co-authors of the new book The counselling of the American mind we discussed the Inception and inspiration of this new book which seeks to assess Council culture as it's harshly affecting American universities and other institutions we break down the difference between feminine and masculine tendencies in regards to free speech the entirely real and yet rarely discussed phenomenon of toxic femininity and why we must prioritize a cultural shift away from the ease of self-described victimhood so you have a new book coming out on October 17th uh this is recorded in 2023 October 17th cancelling of the American mind authors Greg lukinov and Ricky schlot so congratulations on that um thank you so much why don't you start by telling us a little bit about the book and how why you guys are partnering together also to write it yeah well it I mean I think it's probably a little unusual for a 48-year-old and a 23y old to be writing together but I feel I couldn't feel luckier then to get to get to work with Ricky Schlott she's absolutely brilliant and it was something that we knew right away when we saw her writing when she was 19 and 20 that there was something very special about this young woman so originally Ricky reached out to us because she read our my book with Jonathan height coddling of the American mind um and said this is exactly right this is this is exactly what I'm seeing in my own environment that the threats to free speech are also devastating to mental health um and she actually dropped out of NYU in 2020 um also during coid which I think is exactly the right move you know once you're on lockdown drop out um the the defeats of major point of college and originally what we were planning to do uh was write a book or what I was considering doing was writing a book that was a follow-up to codling um even though cancelling is a follow-up in a sense something that was much more directly a follow-up because it it's me you know the book was written by me and Jonathan height like two 48 and 60-year old genen aers but a lot of it's concerned about the terrible uh Injustice we du to young women uh teaching them the mental habits of anxious and depressed people so she wrote me and height to talk about um if we thought maybe co could unod uh young people by presenting challenges that they could then overcome it's a little optimistic yeah probably a little a little overly optimistic uh but I was excited about the premise and uh immediately realizing just how brilliant she was from her writing uh she became a fire fellow and we talked about the idea of working together um on something that would be a follow-up to to talk about from a a gen Z young woman's perspective um but as we were getting ready for that I started realizing that there are still people out there who are trying to claim that canc culture isn't real and I'm like okay I'm sorry like fire is sitting on a mountain of data something absolutely catastrophic has happened on canus in the last 10 years this is easy to establish so we decided to do a book that that focuses on three things one prove it's not just real it's historic um we we don't see the kind of numbers of professors fired uh in the last you know since we we Mark cancel cultures beginning around 2014 we don't see the kind of numbers of professors fired during cancel culture culture since the 1950s uh in the United States there's nothing even close about twice as many professors fired than the standard estimates of mcarthism for example so people saying it doesn't exist is just crazy then then we try to situate it as a as part of a a a way of winning arguments without winning arguments that essentially it succeeds so well because people realize I could well I could try to refute you an argument and I might fail but I could also scare you into thinking that you don't have a livelihood going forward to just make it make the cost so high of dissenting that you win arguments without persuading anybody and then the last part of it is really trying to point to differ potential Solutions yeah and I would also add that the difference of our perspective together is is really rich because I'm I'm Generation Z we're we're decades apart we have very different political beliefs but everything in this book in terms of Classical liberalism and and free speech and pluralism and reinvigorating our democ Ry and our our Civic conversation is just like we hold that so near and dear into our hearts and I think that that cross-generational um kind of melding really worked very well to our advantage in the book absolutely and Ricky also made me more of a cat person no well that's always I seem to get cats in the scheme of in the in the time that we did the book together yeah good good well you're Al always supposed to pet a cat when you meet one on the street you know so I remember that from your book and iice that's exactly right so you now you guys said a bunch of interesting things there and we'll go through them but I want to ask you first Ricky you pointed out that you two have different political beliefs like you share some core presumptions but you have different political beliefs so how would you characterize both the similarities and the differences in your beliefs yeah I'm a I'm a right-leaning libertarian I don't I don't want to speak for you in terms of how you define your politics but I'm I'm left of center homeless Democrat um but definitely and when it comes to and that may sound in like highly inconsistent to a lot of people these days but there was nothing inconsistent for for someone my age to be really pro- free speech and also think of themselves as as a left of center um unfortunately there are fewer and fewer of us when I when I look at what was going on in the 90s you know I always thought kind of like the more working class element of the left would W would win over I and I thought the people who believed in speech codes and you know some of the identity politics stuff were just our crazies who would eventually self- marginalize I'm really disappointed to see that they seem to have all the juice on the left at the moment yeah and it seems like at least in my lifetime the word liberal was associated with very illiberal actions and and things in a way that you know true Classical liberalism is not a partisan divide in my mind and I think that that's really where we share our our common values and um and certainly in in terms of free speech and cancel culture that's like the heart and center of our book and we pull no punches you know when we think the right or left has been wrong just like we do is fire we call them out but when it comes to the um but when it comes to the phenomenon cancel culture the place where it's the most dominant of course is in higher ed and that is a very you know um disproportionately Lefty space and we got and uh it and it's gone really off the rails as you will know in higher ed Ricky how how in the world did you become a Right leaning leaning libertarian I mean as as while Jonathan Heights data in particular I Craig worked on this too I mean the data is indicating quite clearly that there's a growing divide among young men and young women in relationship to their political affiliation with young men increasingly tilting towards where you stand I would say right leaning libertarian and young women increasingly not only becoming much more miserable on the mental health front but also becoming much more leftist so why how is it that you how is it that you aren't part of that cohort since you're not why can why do you think it's reasonable in some sense for you to speak for younger women younger people people younger women and uh why did you drop out of University so I'm actually 23 but my father is 86 and having that breadth of historical knowledge in my household and so near I think made me a little bit more resistant to generational Trends um and you know the tides and just kind of Shifting away from from what I think common sense right and left was which happened and I think a lot of my my parents or my my friends's parents were a little bit more lenient towards the nonsense of what my generation would bring home whereas you know I'd come home to my dad sometimes at dinner and and come home with whatever the next politically correct ism is and and say oh no Dad we don't say African-American anymore we say black and my dad would be like what we we changed that rule like four times and what's what I actually my intent is what matters more than the impact and I think that those sort of formative lessons definitely um grounded me in a different time in space um and I would say you know despite that the the coddling was talking about mental health and and a lot of the cognitive distortions and even though my political orientation is different I did grow up on the internet I did grow up on on Tumblr I have a bunch of friends I saw firsthand just how ugly and and how horrific the Mental Health crisis has been for my generation my freshman you're at NYU I remember like one of the first nights that we were in my dorm um we were all sitting around about six girls and every single girl was comparing her self harm scars I was the only one that didn't have scars and I just remember in that moment being like wow there's something so wrong with this generation and and I'm here firsthand watching it on the ground I feel in some ways a part of it one foot in and one foot out at the same time but certainly I mean it's it's hard to ignore even if your politics are different you're you're myed in it and it's it's so pervasive um and then lastly my decision to drop out of um NYU actually and also I got into Columbia recently and I don't expect to be doing that as well I I don't I don't want to finish my undergraduate degree frankly because I've had I had two great years at NYU but unfortunately this stifling environment was just so beyond something that I could handle for myself and I also think you know I I mean I had a 4.0 I was succeeding I was headed to law school I was I was on the right track but I found something that I was passionate about and I realized that I'd been kind of Hoodwinked by A system that was telling me that I needed to Fork over enormous amounts of money and spend time fulfilling requirements that weren't important to me and writing essays that you know defied my own personal opinions because of the obvious Slants of my professors and so at a at a certain point I realized there are more than one Pathway to success and and I'm going to tread my own and fortunately people like Greg were there to kind of pick me up and and make sure that um I ended up on the right track and so this is a way cooler place to be at 23 than to have just graduated so Greg I wanted to commend you for something first um you're not a psychologist but but you are the most outspoken psychologist that I know of pointing out the fact that if we had set up a cognitive behavioral therapy program Nationwide to demoralize young people we couldn't possibly have done it more effectively speaking strictly from a clinical perspective than we have done yeah every psychologist there is who's worth his or her salt knows that you don't hyper protot people because you make them dependent you don't inundate them with idiot trigger warnings you don't try to infantilize them you gradually expose themel expose them voluntarily to situations and people and ideas that they're leery of and by doing so you fortify them in terms of their own self-concept and their ability to deal with the world and there isn't anything there's nothing that therapists who are real know more thoroughly than that if you don't know that you're not a therapist you're a bloody fraud and despite that there there is an absolute Dar of psychologists speaking out against say cancel culture trigger warnings all of this infantilizing idiocy that characterizes the campuses now that's partly because as I found out in Canada that if you do speak out and this obviously speaks to councel culture the probability that the midlevel miserable resentful bureaucrats who are in charge of doing things like handing out professional licenses will come after you and if you can't afford to have your career threatened well then you're in trouble now I don't think that excuses people precisely because I think there's a time and a place to speak in some ways regardless of personal cost but and the thing is you've spoke so obviously it can be done now I want to talk to you both you guys about some Psych olical ideas that I've been working on and some of them are quite contentious and I'd really white like to know what you think so first of all there is a very large literature on female antisocial Behavior now it's not as extensive as male antisocial Behavior literature because males who are antisocial tend to be violent physically and that gets more attention but there are antisocial females and they have a very set way of going going about destroying their opponents to their own advantage and the way they do that is by innuendo reputation savaging and gossiping and this literature all arose before the dawn of social media and it was very EST well established for multiple decades now my observation is that that scales brilliantly on social media right because you can Savage reputations you can use inuendo you can gossip you can destroy destroy with zero cost to yourself now women tend to turn to that because they they don't engage in physical fighting not between each other very very rarely and they certainly can't fight physically with men so if they're going to be antisocial and instrumental narcissistic Psychopathic and all of that they're going to do it in this more subtle manner now I see absolutely no limits to the expression of that sort of behavior whatsoever on social media in fact quite the contrary that leads to a even more dismal possibility this terrifies me to tell you the truth so you know the the problem of parasitical criminality parasitism in particular is so deep that sex itself evolved as a as a solution to the problem so the problem of parasitism is very very old and this proclivity of the psychopathic and narcissistic types to denigrate and to elevate their reputation falsely is a form of parasitism and it has no constraints whatsoever on social media we know that the troll types and online Criminal types are much more likely to have dark tetrad personality characteristics Machiavellian narcissistic Psychopathic and sadistic because the other three weren't enough my sense is is that we've enabled we've enabled the Psychopaths they have free reign to express themselves in this more feminine antisocial Manner and we risk bringing down the whole house of cards because of it so the first thing I'd like to know is like what do you guys think about that hypothesis this disparity in the virtual versus the real world well uh first thing is that we took this you know head-on and codling of the American mind we we said we didn't apologize for the research and we made the point that when it comes to the different ways that males and females um exercise aggression particularly when they're uh teenagers but also throughout their lives that men is much more physical you know like i' I've been in a lot of fights in my life I've been a bouncer I I I i' I've I've seen that but I also grew up in a house that was dominated by women and that female aggression tends to be um relational that that definitely all these mechanisms that are much more relying on you know verbal Tendencies um and and ways of battling things out verb you know are well established and I I don't think it's any coincidence and this is a very sad fact um but it comes out very it's very clear in the polling is that in general and of course this is you know this talking about um you know polling um women are are more skeptical of uh of freedom of speech that than men are so when you look on campuses um the polling for women's attitudes this is actually a very funny um uh statistic that we found that the schools that tend Ed to have the highest level of students saying um that violence is acceptable in response to speech or that shout Downs are acceptable in response to speech or that um uh or that blocking doors are responsible are acceptable speech or either women's colleges or former women's colleges um so that's that's a distressing you know and that's one of the reason why we have to we want to reach more women because we know that there are plenty of women including Rick Ricky and naen straon who who works for fire you know who are who are great civil Libertarians and we need we need to recruit from that because as universities become uh more feminized it could be a bad an even worsening situation for freedom of speech unless we actually you you know really bring that argument to more women but anyway yeah and I would I would add to that point that I think especially in the past couple decades now that attacks on Free Speech are are tied to emotional harm and the idea that people need to be protected and that that their feelings are hurt I do think that it's just an honest like truth that that just speaks to the female proclivities a little bit more and so in some in some aspects and I suppose the more antisocial people that becomes a really militant response that they they act on when they feel as though they're they're able to be the Arbiters of justice and to protect weaker more vulnerable people um in just like a pure emotional sense I would say as well a few decades ago private citizens used to be largely that private the internet has changed this think about everything you've browsed search for watched or tweeted now imagine all of that data being crawled through collected and aggregated by Third parties into a permanent public record your record having your private life exposed for others to see was once something only celebrities worried about but in an era where everyone is online everyone is a public figure to keep my data private when I go online I turn to expressvpn did you know there are hundreds of data Brokers out there whose sole business is to buy and sell your data the worst part is they don't have to tell you who they're selling it to or get your consent one of these data points is your IP address data Harvesters use your IP to uniquely identify you and your location but with expressvpn my connection gets rerouted through an encrypted server and my IP address is masked every time I turn expressvpn on I'm given a random IP address shared by other expressvpn customers that makes it more difficult for third parties to identify me and harvest my data and the best part is how easy expressvpn is to use no matter what device you're on phone laptop or smart TV all you have to do is tap one button to get protected so if like me you believe that your data is your business secure yourself with the number one rated VPN on the market visit expressvpn.com Jordan that's expressvpn.com Jordan for three extra months free expressvpn.com [Music] Jordan yeah or or they or they pretend a kind of genuine feminine compassion and use that as a mask to cover their actual antisocial motivations right because the the borderline personality types and the real psychopaths this is particularly true on the female side in relationship say to borderline pathology they use self-proclaimed stories of victimization as manipulative techniques and part of the reason for that is that if you're really Serpentine in Your Capacity to manipulate you harness the person the persons that the person that you're manipulating you harness their compassion right because that's a very effective way of of hiding from them your predatory proclivities it's extremely dangerous and so I have a question for you a deeper question Ricky and so this is a horrible question I don't think anybody's ever raised it so I am I am I am not convinced that higher education institutions and maybe institutions in general why should we be convinced that they can survive if females run them and here's I'm not saying they can't but I'm going to present the counterargument just for the sake of getting myself in all sorts of trouble here's what I see happening I mean first of all or what may be happening childless women infantilize other people because they don't have an infant and so female administrators infantilize their students female professors infantilize their graduate students they they use that fundamental impetus to protect they misuse it misapply it now that's well documented proclivity in the clinical literature the psychoanalysts documented that starting with Freud that's the devouring mother fundamentally so and then we have no historical data suggesting that women as such can organize large scale social institutions because as the feminists themselves have claimed forever they were either not doing that or excluded from it forever and it may be naive to assume that that's just something that women can do even though that's as I said there's no historical there's no historical precedent for it now I did research in 2016 before I had to stop fold up my research Enterprise entirely we were looking at what predicted authoritarian politically correct beliefs and we did a very careful job the first thing did was analyze political beliefs to see if there were a collection of coherent beliefs that you could identify as authoritarian politically correct and there clearly was so it's not just a right-wing conspiracy theory that such a complex of ideas exists and then we looked at what predicted the proclivity to believe in those ideas and the first predictor was low verbal intelligence and it was a walloping predictor it predicted politically correct authoritarianism better than General cognitive ability predicts grave so that was quite shocking to us but the next best predictor was being female and the next best predictor was having a feminine temperament and so you know all that together makes up a pretty damn brutal story and so you said both of you said that you know you're very much hoping to reach out to women um and and fair enough and obviously there are women like Ricky who adopt viewpoints that aren't totalitarian compassionate let's say but something's very strange in higher Academia and in our institutions overall and I think toxic femininity is a very much underd discussed phenomenon so well with that have at it because like anything I said that you think is wrong boy I'd sure like to hear it well I definitely can only really provide anic data to the survey data that you have but I would definitely say that in my experience the people that have been most militant in circles of higher education have been my my female uh my fellow students and also professors as well but I think that you know regardless of of whether there's a a on the mean of women is to lean that way further one way or another like we can't change that aspect of Nature and one thing that I do think that we can change just going into the inevitable future of more women in these institutions is making sure two things first I think from the root of Education just as young as kindergarten we need to emphasize rationality and stop like feeding into kids emotions and just saying you're always right and you're totally you're totally valid and you do you and if you're if you're upset about this or if you feel harmed by this then we need to empower you to accept that reality I think that we like that's what the cuddling of the American mind talked about and I think that that really hijacks women's psyches more and I think that we need to from the start of Education emphasize rationality that emotions are are a valid part of the human experience but that they should not lead your your rational Common Sense kind of mindset so I think that's one thing and I think the other thing is also making sure that our our universities can maintain a balance that's more healthy than the balance that we have right now because like I I think of Richard Reeves and his research in in boys and men falling behind and so I think it's a a combination of having to make sure that we can foster young men who are able to take up leadership roles in higher education um I think that the education system by and large is is fairly feminized and and it definitely feeds more into to female strengths than male strengths especially um given the fact that girls tend to develop a couple years earlier than boys and so I think that that's another thing that we you know maybe it's as simple as redshirting boys and making sure that we have more young men who will end up in those leadership positions in the end because having a 6040 uh split which I think is what the current situation is in higher education right now is not healthy I don't think for the future or for society no one no no one side should be falling behind so dramatically and so quickly over the past couple decades so those would be my two my two things to point to on that front Okay so let's talk okay let's talk about that so so the first question you might ask is if there is a feminine proclivity to prioritize emotion why might that be and I would say there's two reasons one in one which is nested in the other so women are higher in trait neuroticism which makes them more prone to feeling negative emotion they feel it more frequently and more powerfully and that's extraordinarily well documented phenomena cross-culturally I don't think any psychologist who knows the literature would doubt it and it's butress by the fact that there are sex differences in different forms of Psychopathology so men for example are overrepresented in alcoholism and in violent antisocial proclivity but women are radically over represented in depression and anxiety and that's also true cross-culturally so women feel negative emotions more intensely now then you might ask well why is that and the answer seems to be well it has something to do with sexual maturation because the differences in temperament aren't there in childhood they appear with sexual maturation and the reason for that here's three reasons one is well women are smaller than men at physical maturation and so they should be L they should be more anxiety prone in a physical conflict and that should that should co-occur with puberty because that's when the size and strength differential kicks in then women are much more sexually vulnerable than men because of course they can get pregnant and they have to bear the cost of that and then probably more importantly women have to take primary responsibility for early stage infant care and the thing about infants is all they have is emotion to communicate and and more importantly possibly their emotions have to be regarded as 100% valid and correct right because if you're a good mother and I saw this with my wife who by the way is not particularly agreeable and is very low in neuroticism she would respond to her infant's distress like in a microsecond and that was extremely helpful and it is the case that because human infants are born so helpless so neous that they have to be attended to with great care and they have to be treated as if their distress is 100% valid now you got to stop doing that at about 9 months of age and that's a hard transition for women to make and so I have this sinking feeling that the default female ethical proclivity is to prioritize emotion to attribute it to to it 100% validity because that serves infants best and that that bleeds out into the relationships that women establish when they produce large-scale social institutions now you said and fair enough you know possibly we could prioritize rationality over emotionality and we could start doing that in kindergarten but I guess the counter position would be hey you know that's what we were doing and then the consequence of having women flood into these institutions is that was instantly inverted and so maybe education can do something about that and and maybe not so and it's not like I'm happy about this or even that I believe it although you know it's it's a hard argument for me to escape from I'm certainly not happy about it I think it's completely bloody dismal but yeah but unless see Greg you said earlier something really kicked around in 20 2014 right something shifted and the biggest shift in the last 20 years is definitely on the sex balance in universities like that's the most stunning transformation so have at Greg what do you think about all this sure well when it comes to um whether you know um feminization of Institutions um it's a fact it feminization of politics feminization of Corporations or higher education and we just have to figure out ways to make uh to to not give up on these institutions because they become feminized now I do have some hope there partially because uh I you know I'm I think that men um have been able to reflect on uh downsides of masculinity um in including things like excessive machismo which can be very destructive um and I've certainly seen that in my own life and among among my own friends um that there there there's a there's a kind of dangerousness and stupidity that men have as well now as a society gets more feminized I don't think um it's going to take forever for for people to start realizing that a more feminized Society also has its own unique downsides and for people to especially women to push back against some of these and there certainly are women out there who are pushing against it I should note that some of the best Champions against cancel culture are themselves women Al Alice Dreer uh Megan D Bridget fsy there's a long list who really JK Rowling who have really really stood up against this so I think that yeah I I think that by Nature you know uh different genders and this is actually of course the fact that saying this is radioactive I think is just absolutely ridiculous talking about that different genders have different strengths and weaknesses that's a fact um but we C we have we do have a not bad track record of learning how to um recognize uh what were our strengths of weaknesses and and get past them and and we're going to have to because it's not like a higher ed is going to is is going to suddenly um have good gender balance like immediately but one of the things that we really do try to point out in the book and a major part of the book um is we talk about different kinds of rhetorical fortresses um and what we mean by that are really creative and some not very creative ways of getting out of addressing someone's actual argument and we talk we we first go through the ones that left and right and basically all human anity uses which we call the mindfield and the obstacle course but then when we get to on the left we go through through this thing that we call the perfect rhetorical Fortress it is just this Exquisite Maze of dodges uh all over the place of ways to not have to address your your the person's argument and we even go through that what we call the Dem the first one by the way is labeling someone conservative um and this worked back when back when I was in law school I'm embarrassed to admit and I and I I'm very embarrassed to admit it worked on me that essentially if you could label a writer as yeah that if you could label a writer as Conservative then suddenly you took them less seriously um and that that was something that I I'm embarrassed to admit um so that's level one and that's just ridiculous that's that's the way children are argue but then we take through the entire demographic funnel and of course you can dismiss someone on the basis of gender on the basis of sex on the basis of uh race on the basis of Etc and we bring get you down the demographic funnel to about 0 4% of the entire population of the US and then say and by the way none of it actually mattered because if you have the wrong opinion like JK rling or for that matter um uh black conservatives you're still discounted anyway um and and one thing that really kind of gave truth to the lies I talked to every black conservative writer and black moderate um that I know all of them said they've been told they're not really black um for having the having the wrong opinion so it's really more of a Dogma protection uh system so I do think that there is hope that if if we basically can get even if we can just establish uh get back to rules we all know are better for finding truth um and get away from from this ridiculous way of arguing that literally has no uh help hope of getting you towards the truth and actually waste time to just get to whatever your opinion is that if you can focus on constructive ways of arguing there is still some hope I would also add that I see some hope in in alternative educational methods that are popping up especially postco and you know I think part of the problem is the education schools are so politicized in America and so feminized and um and also at the same time you have the vast majority of teachers especially at younger grades who are women but I think so ideological too education absolutely and and I think that and it and it tap those schools tap into those those instincts and those those um negative feminine instincts that you're talking about Dr Peterson and I think that especially postco now that we're looking at different models and and different um educational forms and different ways that parents can be involved or or positive male role models can be involved in in education uh from the start I think that that has the Upstream effect hopefully of of counterbalancing some of the the excesses that we see in our universities today I honestly think that mechanisms that that allow people to completely sidestep higher education is actually in some cases our best hope for making higher education better because right now you know you go to Harvard you know um you who knows if you're it's a good guess that you're probably pretty smart and work pretty hard in high school but not necessarily um you you you could also be like the kid of a major donor or let in on an athletic scholarship um and the average grade uh GPA now at Harvard is 3.8 which which is which is like an A plus so right now we have at least an opportunity that schools the really prestigious Elite schools are no longer very good markers of who are going to be your best hires or who are going to be your best employees because you might they might be smart they might not be you can't really tell if they learned anything because they all get 3.8s um and they also are likely to come with them a very um difficult to work with kind of idea of you know my my workplace is oppressive meanwhile if there are ways for the for for hardworking smart kids to be able to show that they are conscientious that they're able to re they're able to read at a at a high level that they're that and that they are the hardest working and and best and brightest that can be done actually really inexpensively um and if we start actually looking at some of these alternative uh ways of of educating yourself it could it will scare Elite colleges like crazy and I mean and I tried to practice what I preach here because originally like we had a policy um and I didn't realize this that we have a policy that we wouldn't uh hire non-degree holders um when I re when this was pointed out to me when we're considering hiring Ricky I'm like oh my God I'm not I'm not practicing what I preach here we have to get rid of this policy um and I think more places should because there's going to be a lot of really super smart people who are smart enough to see that they should opt out of the of higher ed as it currently exists and and try to figure out to show that they're the best brightest hardest working in different ways we're going to launch a new University in November called Peterson Academy and I've spent a lot of time researching objective assessment methods for General cognitive ability and for conscientiousness and the universities have left that all on the table and it's of unbelievable economic worth and my sense is is that a system that would actually provide a genuine assessment and accreditation of people based on their intellectual Merit and their ability to work hard would be of e incalculable economic value and could supplant the universities very rapidly that is what should happen I had no idea you're working on that by the way just completely we got 30 great professors already up we think we can knock the price of a degree equivalent down to $4,000 so which I think would be absolutely hilarious yeah so Rick Ricky I should point out here you know I I went after women pretty hard and I think rightly so in some ways but I I want to point some things out that I know too just so just so you know and everybody listening knows where I stand the data on ability with regards to men and women is pretty damn clear men and women have virtually identical levels of General cognitive ability there might be some additional variability in men although that's disputable but fundamentally half the intellectual capital in the world is in the hands of women and we'd be absolutely fools not to make full use of that right and we know too that countries that have a better record of uh of rights for women and also providing better access to women on the educational front they do way better economically it's it's not even close and so it's obviously the case that it would be to the benefit of everyone if we could harness the full potential Talent of people regardless of sex you know the old liberal dream um that doesn't solve the problem of the fact that we're corrupting our institutions at a rate that's absolutely beyond comprehension but it does mean that you know we're not going to put the genie in the back back in the bottle and neither should we if we can as we have if we can free up women so that they can have their families and their relationships just like men and they can produce and and explore and create in relative Freedom obviously that would be better for everyone I just wanted to make that clear I want to put one more pessimistic observation that you guys can comment on and then maybe we'll turn to fire for a minute and your recent rankings of freedom on free on campus well so we have this potential problem of the feminization of the institutions and and the rise of politically correct authoritarian Doctrine and the cancel culture that's emerged out of that we've talked a little bit about that I guess I think May maybe maybe we're in a perfect storm because if it's true that antisocial female behavior in particular scales extremely well on social media maybe what we're seeing is this weird unexpected interaction where we have you know the emergence of female dominated institutions at exactly the same time we have this immense technological capacity that we never had before that enables the worst of feminine like Behavior to make itself fully manest in the public sphere now I know that lots of trolls online by the way are men and perhaps even the majority of them but but that that's not precisely the point the point is that it's reputation savaging gossiping and innuendo that the net does particularly well and that puts us all in a well it exacerbates it might be exaggerating substantially the the detrimental effects that we're also seeing as a consequence of the rapid sex transformation in our institutions so Greg I don't know if you have any thoughts about that if what you think about that as a potential observation um I think that when you pointed to the the sex difference being the major change that we saw in 2014 and I know it's almost become a cliche I really do think that the big change that that allowed for cancel culture more than anything else is a massive technological shift and when I was in the law school I did six credits on censorship during the tutor Dynasty um and because I'm a First Amendment nerd and our our uh theory of prior restraint in the United States and First Amendment law comes actually out of the old print licensing scheme in tutor in Stuart England um and I I actually studied a lot of of of the first person who to licensed printers in um uh in England which was Henry VII and you can see from 1521 to 1538 this desire to uh put the genie back in the bottle as you say um but the the simple fact is that when you introduce a huge number of additional people to a global conversation it is unavoidable that you'll enter an anarchical period you're going to enter a a a crazy period because yes printing press long-term great benefits to it shortterm increase in The Witch Trials um absolutely crazy bloody wars of religion um that it led to some short-term really horrific results and what we've just just done particularly with the rise of social media is we've done something and people really have to appreciate like how what the scale of this we just made it possible due to largely social media and the internet over an incredibly short period of time introduce billions of additional eyes um and and mouths to to a discussion and when you have that much that many critical eyes on a problem you can tear down any person and that's cancel culture any idea or any institution um but I think that the pessimism that we have right now is part partially because and I and I you know my my co-author John height and so many other people are trying to figure out ways to put the social media Genie back in the bottle and I'm the one telling them like I've got bad news for you there is no way to avoid this being a crazy period however cultures adapt people people learn um people do actually learn new cultural ways of adapting to a major technological shifts and over a period of time it actually turned out that those extra million eyes that the printing press brought on to problems were incredibly good at actually getting towards truth because you had Mass disconfirmation you had people you had that many more people reading something could actually point out falsity much faster and that's the way you get to truth Mo mostly is just by chipping away at falsity um and I feel like there is I I have not stopped being at least to some degree a techno Optimist because I think once you have an extra billion eyes on on a problem you can actually solve some problems um much more thoroughly and much more quickly if you're not using it just to gossip just to cancel people just to if if you use it to argue towards truth and that's something that we really emphasize in the book it's like listen social media as it currently exists there could be a better way and I know that there're all small companies trying to actually figure out ways to argue toward uh argue towards truth so so the short-term pessimism that we all feel it doesn't have to be this way forever and I think that when when you alluded to the idea that there are some reasons to be wildly optimistic as well you know like I think we're both there talking about uh potential technological advant advances it really could you know save save the species so to speak um so I do I do think that long term a lot of the problems that we're seeing right now are the early problems created by something that will ultimately prove to be a positive shift yeah well your your well your comments about what happened after the printing press was enabled are very interesting I mean so what's essentially happening according to your uh analysis is that the territory of public discourse has expanded extremely rapidly twice in the last 500 years once with the introduction of the printing press and now once with the introduction really well of a variety of modes of communication that were not there before including long-term video and audio and the permanence of those and and then the fact that people commun can communicate with the pen stroke with millions of people so we've expanded the polity of free speech dramatically now you could make the case and I think this is what you're doing that there's going to be a lag before the institutions catch up right and those would be the cultural norm institutions but also the rules and regulations the laws it's the wild west and what that means is in the wild west while the Psychopaths have an opportunity to flourish at least temporarily till everybody figures out how to get the back under control yeah the problem I see that's fair enough and you could well be right the problem I see is that well there's a bunch of problems is that the way that Psychopaths the manipulative types are held responsible is that people eventually learn who they are right so well first of all if you're enough of a prick in in face-to-face contact with people especially among men you're going to get punched and so that tends to keep that down as long as you're in embodied form and a few feet away from each other and of course that disappears if you're separated which is why people are more aggressive when they yell inside their own cars for example and it's completely gone well right exactly it's a very well-known phenomenon and it completely vanishes online now the problem is with online communication is there's no iterability in it right because you can poke someone hard and then run away and never just never see them again so there's no constraint of iterability which is a big problem and you can do this anonymously you know and I've gone after the online Anonymous trolls and I know the Le literature uh indicating that online Anonymous troublemaking trolls tend to have dark tetrad personality types and they all at me because I they think well we have to be anonymous because you know we're heroic whistleblowers and otherwise we'll be cancelled it's like no one of you in 10,000 is a heroic whistleblower and the rest you are just the sorts of Pricks who sit in their basement and poke at things who would immediately get punched in high school and that's gone and so and so but I can't see a way like one of the things I've I've thought through is the fact that you know the social media companies could separate the anonymous types from the people who had actual verifiable identities but I'm also afraid of verifiable identity because that takes us down the whole digital identity route and that's God man look what's happened in China that's just that doesn't look like's happen in Canada well oh yeah Canada yeah yeah yeah yeah I know well people in Canada they say well you keep warning that free speech is endanger it's like no no guys I'm War warning you that free speech in Canada is already gone it's not in danger it's already gone and you know to the the degree that that's the case in places like the US is debatable but I don't think it's debatable in Canada it's just that people haven't woken up to it anyways you are optimistic but with that optimism I mean what do you see what do you see okay okay well fair enough fair enough you know I mean we're we're in very very variable times let's say I mean I'd call myself hopeful okay well what do you see you you've thought about this a lot both of you what do you see that might actually be done concretely to regulate this proclivity towards Council culture without also you know I see what Christopher rufo and people like him are doing in Florida you know and I have some real sympathy for their attempts but I can easily see that going astray too you know once the politicians enter The Fray of ideas I mean how could that go wrong I mean it's going to go wrong real fast right real fast real fast yeah absolutely man because most of these ideas have to be beat in the realm of ideas as far as I can tell yeah right so but so what do you see as concrete steps that are positive that we could take moving forward say within the universities yeah no ABS absolutely and what what's funny is um you know I end up you know arguing with with uh rufo about reforms and step number one and I believe profoundly in higher education reform um but step number one of reform is you have to pass something that actually is legal is actually not going to be immedi laughed out of court and so this is what we warned about some of the regulations that they were trying in Florida um because I'm I'm a First Amendment lawyer and and we looked at what the stop woke act that disantis you know came out with them like no no no no no that's going that will never survive judicial scrutiny and by the way we are principal and nonpartisan and will be one of the ones to sue them but definitely even if we didn't the ACLU is going to sue and you're going to lose and you're going to lose very clearly and you're going to waste oxygen of the reform movement you're going to achieve nothing you're going to give them a new Boogeyman it will get you nowhere and so far that's exactly what happened um meanwhile some of the other reforms that Dan santis was talking about were were great ideas um when it came to you know for example having you know um as part of orientation debate Series where you actually have people argue about the uh most radioactive Topics in the country that could be amazing talking about free speech and orientation could be amazing um I think that uh that reducing the bureaucracy is something I've been saying for decades um a lot of the worst things that are happening for freedom of speech at first for the first part of my career they were overwhelmingly coming from the ranks of Administrators um and then in 2014 they started coming from the students as well um now people sometimes think what I'm saying is it used to be administrators and now it's students no it now it's administrators and students and usually and students they like so like what happened at Stanford my myma moer um when they you know shouted down judge Kyle Duncan you know that very much seemed to be a collaboration between some administrators in the Dei programs and and and students students themselves to do to do a shout down there so I think a deep bureaucratized University will will have more uh will have more free speech um it will have more due process uh and it will have fewer of these uh fewer of these incidents but I also think we desperately need the kind of experimentation that you're doing and University of Texas at Austin is doing uh manura University out in San Francisco like ways that actually can perform better at much lower costs that can actually tell you who the best and brightest and most hardworking are out there um and and your point about the laws going horribly wrong that essentially if you think you can just get rid of bad ideas on on on campus through legislation well I've got bad news for you they're already trying to do that all across the country they're just coming at it from the left rather than the right and I'm very proud that we were able to find because we've been looking and Dr Peterson we've been looking for this for a long time we wanted to find a a really good read terrible uh Dei policy to shoot down in court to make it clear that this is compelled speech this is against academic freedom this is utterly inappropriate for a place that's supposed to be the marketplace of ideas and we found that unsurprisingly in California uh and the California community college system had a system that actually requires you what and this includes whether you're a chemistry professor English Professor to incorporate uh um uh what is it called uh intersectionality um anti-racism uh you know which is which is kend's kend's idea um to incorporate all of these ideological things that a a lot of people don't even believe are true to begin with but that you have to actually um incorporate in your classroom regardless of what you teach and regardless of whether or not you disagree with them or not so we brought this in court and it's very it's been very funny to me um watching people who were totally with us when when we litigated against the stop woke act freaking out that we're litigating against the Dei um tyranny and and making the point that that and I just argue back to him like no this is a gross violation I always make the point that telling people what they can't say is really bad and we will always fight it telling people what they must say is a thousand times worse and we will definitely fight that right away that's what I objected to in Canada and that's also why my license is on the line now is because I am being told what I have to say which is way different than what I can't say you know it's a little bit of both but yeah it's stunning it's beyond comprehension well the other thing the other thing we found by the way in that research I referred to was that if people had taken even one course that had a politically correct orientation they were also much more likely to be politically correct authoritarian so this this tactic that the radicals on the left have of gaining control of the education system that's unbelievably effective and Ricky you mentioned earlier this is something that's been an absolute bloody mystery to me I can't believe you know I'm not a fan of the Democrats in the US for what that's worth given that I'm Canadian but um the Republicans and the conservatives have their problems and some one of those problems is kind of shortsightedness is like I cannot believe and I haven't had anyone explain this to me except Chris I talked to Chris Christie about this because he went to battle with the teachers unions in New Jersey so you know the faculties of Education have a monopolistic Hammer lock on teacher certification right and there's like absolutely no reason for that the faculties of Education there to call their research dismal and misleading is to barely scrape the surface they got to stupid several decades before the rest of the universities they generally have the students who perform the worst academically and so and everything they teach is ideological and unfounded there's no evidence whatsoever that the faculties of Education know anything whatsoever about making better students and yet they have a hammer lock on teacher certification and that essentially gives the progressive radicals access to 50% of the state budgets in the US so it's no bloody wonder that the Liberals the real liberals and the conservatives are losing the culture War I mean they handed the children and we've handed all the children to the faculties of Education for the life of me I can't understand how conservatives can't see that and I just want to add one thing that we didn't know when codling of the American mind came out and we should have um is that uh we've been calling out education schools you know since we were founded at fire and one thing that we fought successfully by the way um what was the accreditation body for most education schools tried to have a social justice requirement I'm saying that you could not graduate with a degree in education unless you proved your commitment to social justice um which is is were like uh guys if you don't see this as as an obvious political litness test then I don't know what to say so we got that defeated but of course when you have a situation where only fire and some other groups are objecting to an obvious political litmus test um and it's considered just fine among other people in the field then the problem's already gone way too far one thing we didn't know though is how much of the administration at universities come from education schools and that we we were way ahead of the curve fighting um at University of Delaware back in 2007 they had this absolutely crazy brainwashing program um that involved you know people having mandatory meetings with their raas where they had to confess um to uh they had to talk about like when they discovered their sexual identity and this was in this case like one of the examples we had was a y a young woman you know being in a in a session with a a man's room being asked this and and her answer was none of your damn business and she actually got written up for that we're like that's exactly the right the right call on that so we we've been fighting this for a long time but we didn't actually fully fully understand how much of the distortions we see in highered as it currently exists actually come from the fact that that the administrators who are enforcing these rules and enforcing the speech codes and enforcing the bias related incident program policies are actually education school graduates themselves the Bible is the root of all wisdom inspiration and spiritual nourishment the hall app

they're they're responsible also for the worst excesses of so-called psychological research in the last 60 years it's like the self-esteem movement that was a complete bloody catastrophe that was the first time that the univer or that the schools set out to actually produce neurotic narcissists and they did that quite successfully they pushed whole word learning which plummeted California from top of the national standings and literacy to bottom within about 10 years right predicated on the idea that just because expert readers could read a word at a glance that we should teach children to do the same even though we have a Phanatic alphabet which might have been a hint right the education schools produced multiple intelligences which was a complete bloody fraud they produced practical intelligence social emotional learning like it's just one destructive counterproductive anti-scientific fad after another and that's in addition to the fact that while they're woke Beyond Comprehension incompetent and generally have the worst students and the lowest academic standards so the conservatives couldn't possibly have done a worse job of defending their own territory if they would have come up with a plan to do so so Ricky with with with what you're doing like my daughter is pretty active on social media and she has a background similar to yours I'd say her political leanings are probably approximately the same as yours somewhat right leaning libertarian um what sort of what sort of cancellation Etc do you face online like I mean I've read the comments directed towards my daughter and I mean the ones directed to me are pretty brutal but women do face a level of brutality especially personal attacks often appearance related that men just don't face and so what's that been like for you and how is it has it been a problem and how how do you defend yourself against that look at the expression yeah um yeah I think you know it I'm I'm benefited by the fact that I grew up with social media and I was on this is one of the few upsides of that fact that I've been on Instagram since I was 11 unfortunately but I do know how to deal with um negative comments and negative feedback just from day one essentially of being a an adolescent but I would say yeah when I I did my first real foray into Mass exposure and and seeing what you know I I I tend to be like I kind of roll my eyes at the like misogyny and ult like a lot of my feminist friends who are seeing it in every corner but my god when I did Bill Mah did I see just like the wrath of God come for me a way that was not coming for my co-panelist so that definitely was a um a a humbling experience I made the mistake of reading the Reddit threads and then told myself never again now I know what's out there I know what they can come come at me with um but I would say yeah there was that that definitely um weirdly all people on the left I found so far at least when I am on conservative forums maybe because they're more friendly to my ideology I'd get less of that um but certainly a lot of the more left leaning Bill Mah fans were um less less fans of mine than than most of my audience Jordan I I I I tweeted out um you know about like how uh like I said at the beginning how lucky I felt to work with ricking and we're we're a great team because I'm I'm a crazy overwriterz with um and I I mentioned this on Twitter and of course a lot of people who think of themselves as Champion women and and and uh you know very Progressive on the left immediately were like oh you're just riding with her because she's a uh because she's a skinny blonde who works for Fox and I was kind of like wow so you're just I'm I'm writing with her because she's brilliant and the funny thing is we we'd never met until probably like we met after we signed the book deal actually in person for the first time which is funny this is a pandemic uh pandemic meeting of mine so it was kind of funny like because I I was so impressed with her and my interactions with her was was just like email and phone calls when I first saw her I'm like oh my God you really are a kid my response and Dr Peterson if I may go back to your question about what we can do to actually solve cancel culture I do have um you know my my expertise is certainly less professional but more on the ground as a young person growing up in the age of cancel culture for as long as I can effectively remember and I have to tell you one thing that I think is just so underappreciated is the fact that just courage is contagious and when I was at NYU I learned I learned the hard way that cancel culture thrives off of making everyone feel alone and as though they're the only person around them that thinks the way that they do it incentivizes you to close in on yourself to not to not share your beliefs and you know you could be sitting next to a roommate who feels the same way or someone across the hall and I was when I first decided my first article um that was published was actually in the daily wire and when I first decided to put my name to an article I was ready for everyone I knew to instantaneously hate me and disown me and some people not huge fans of what I was writing and that's fine but I found out that there were so many people that I was so close to in so many ways that actually shared a lot of my political beliefs or at least the core principles of of Classical liberalism or or they respected me in a way that I didn't expect and even at a place like NYU and I I actually say this in our book but um I when I was a freshman I was hiding books under my bed including your book 12 rolls for life and Thomas Souls books so I had my like secret Library underneath my bed which I'm ashamed to admit looking back but when you're 18-year-old in a new place yeah exactly but when you're an 18-year-old in a new place like the incentives are to to close in on yourself and as soon as I spoke out I had administrators professors people that lived on my floor in my dorm people that I was friends with for years and like if we can just prove that this is a tyranny of the minority which it absolutely is statistically even with Gen Z even though our genz politics are so out of control if you look at what Generations have a positive view of cancel culture the most positive view is Millennials it tapers down as as you get older but the least positive view by far is Gen Z because we grew up in it we know how awful it is to be a teenager with trip wires all around you and if we could just get more young people to say you know what here I am being open and honest and humble and and criticize my beliefs but they're they're out here and this is who I am then the courage will be contagious I feel very confident in that well there's something I want to zero in on that too so you tell me what your experience was so you said you know you were hesitant when you first started to write but um so one of the things I've realized more clearly in the last five or six years is that the the meaning that sustains you in life is certainly not a hedonic meaning and the reason for that at least in part is that well Hedonism can make you impulsive and make you sacrifice the future for the present and it can alienate you from other people because if you're hedonistically inclined you'll use other people but there's a deeper reason why it's not reliable as a means of orientation and that is that if something terrible happens to you Hedonism isn't going to protect you because you're not happy when you're suffering and so if you're relying on a hedonistic Viewpoint then as soon as you're miserable you're doomed so then you might say well what do you turn to to sustain you and you can think well you have your relationships your loves and your interests and all of that and I think that that's crucial but there's something else that sustains you too and I think this points deeply to what makes life actually meaningful and that is that Adventure sustains you you know and I think were built for the kind of Glorious Adventures that we like to go watch on movies maybe a romantic adventure that's the Pinnacle of Adventure you know and then you might ask yourself well if you wanted to have an adventure maybe a true romantic adventure that was even beyond the scope of your wildest dreams how might you find that and I would say well you find that by telling the truth because if you see if you tell the truth you have to let go of what you want right because you don't know what's going to happen happen when you say what you think if you're crafting your message to gain a particular outcome you're not telling the truth you're using your words in a manipulative way now you have experience of this is this is what I've gleaned from what you've told me so far is that you know you were in a relatively woke environment to say the least and then you decided that you were going to actually write what you believe to be true okay what was the consequence of that for you I mean I certainly have a few less friendships but they were not the the ones that were um meaningful and actually bringing me towards my my higher purpose in life I think 100% And I I mean I have to say looking back as scary as it was to be on the precipice of deciding do I want this to Forever you know Google will exist and that my name was forever in the record with all my political opinions and it felt very much like like a noo back sort of situation and I can I have absolutely zero regrets at all whatsoever because as you're saying like the authenticity is is the most important thing and I I think that there's real crisis with young people who are growing up online even if it's not their politics even if it's just feeling like if they say something in Artful or they make a dumb joke in they're a teenager that it could be screenshotted and sent to everyone or sent to their college or their college might revoke their admissions like I think that we've the the way that our our our teenage fumbles are just so etched in stone with technology and social media today I think is really causing a crisis of authenticity with young people and we need to wake up that well you know you said you started writing and that went very well you it propelled you out of University it propelled you into this career you already have at a very young age as a columnist it's propelled you into a fire uh fellowship and now you're about to become the co-author of a book that will probably be bestseller and you know you got rid of some friends you didn't need because you found out who they really were and to me that seems like nothing but benefit now that you know my observ has being if you do say what you think there's a short-term price to be paid which is of course why people lie to begin with they want to avoid the price or they want to gain something they don't deserve so that's the reason to lie so what's the reason not to lie well the answer is you get to have your adventure now you have to pay the price for it and that might be that you get raked over the coals a little bit when you open your mouth but it looks to me like you know you're on a pretty good pathway at the moment and and that wouldn't happened if you wouldn't have de decided to take the risk to actually write down what you believe to be true you know despite your Youth and your lack of preparation for doing so right so you have that psychological authenticity but that's not all that happened as soon as you did that a a whole series of doors open to you and there's no reason to assume at all that that's going to stop and I think that happens to everyone if they actually if they actually abide by and speak the truth I think that pathway is open everyone and Jordan a ma a major theme of the book um and one of the things we try to explain to people is sometimes people say oh canc culture is of course real but it doesn't affect me I'll never be canceled I'm not an environment where I'll be canceled and time and time again of course I hear this from professors and within like a year they're they're writing fire to ask for our help um but even off campus one of the ways in which cancel culture is devastating and and we we see this in the case of like Carol hooven um a professor at uh at Harvard who stepped down down from her position um and and left Harvard for a while um after she just went on Fox News and argued that biological sex exists and got targeted by by administrators there and argued it so tactfully tactfully compassion mistake she she's a she's wonderful person but of course what I feel like the the these people don't get is as like you know that you've completely destroyed any credibility that anybody will have ever debating these topics ever again when it comes from Academia if if people know that one Galileo can be sacrificed for arguing that this you know the earth goes around the Sun they're they're not going to trust anybody else who says that the Sun goes around the earth again you know um like it that that's just the way it works and from that kind of effect of having the billion extra eyes on the problem what I feel like it is it showed us how shallow our expert class is how shallow our pundit class is how uh you know it let let more people know about the replication crisis and how much shatty research comes out of higher ed and that led to sort of like an epistemic anarchy kind of situation like we currently have but that's not sustainable and what happens over time and I think is happening is people are looking primarily to individuals who they're like okay who who has always been honest to me who has actually always said what they think is actually true and I think that one of the reasons why I'm like I said I'm not necessarily optimistic but I am hopeful is that and particularly on places like substack for example you you you see some of these experts who have always shown Integrity you know having creating audiences around themselves to be the people who raise their hand and say by the way one thing I can say is you'll always get the truth from me yeah yeah like Jay Bacher at Stanford for example yeah there's lots of examples like that now and there's more academics like that coming out of the woodwork all the time hey so let's talk about Harvard you brought up Harvard I used to work at Harvard and I loved it there it was a great institution when I was there in the '90s um you in a fit comic uh accuracy your organization fire has just awarded Harvard your coveted you score below zero on campus freedom score and which I don't know how you can score below zero on a scale so I'd like to hear about that I think you gave them you actually invented a new category which was abysmal and abysmal is not good um can you explain why is this not just a joke let's say and can you justify what you did and let people know what it means yeah I've been I've been kind of amused by uh some people that I know at Harvard um claiming that our survey was arbitrary because it couldn't possibly be true that Harvard scored actually Less Than Zero by by by our um by our rating now to be clear we have done every year we've been doing it fire has conducted and progressively the largest study of student opinion about the atmosphere for freedom of speech on their campus ever um like from the very from our very first one I believe it was the largest one that was ever of student opinion and now we're up to 55,000 students that we talk to we create um we work with a group called College pulse we create representative panels at each school um we survey them on everything from how acceptable violence is and response to freedom of speech to whether or not they feel uh like they can disagree with each other or whether or not they're afraid to disagree with their professors we also have the largest database of speech codes ever put together um we we evaluate universities according to their their written policies we evaluate them in terms of cancellation of professors and attempts to cancel professors we certainly think that if you have a huge number of professors who have been targeted that certainly speaks badly of the environment to begin with but certainly if you're firing them to or punishing them to that that's even worse and that's a bigger D we have the biggest database of students be uh being targeted and we combine all of this research together in in definitely the most ambitious attempt to rank schools according to freedom of speech you know ever done and I don't put a thumb on the scale at any of this and Harvard when we uh never did well on on our survey it was always in the bottom fifth sometimes it was in the bottom 10 um last year it was uh in the bottom fifth um but every year we try to refine it we try to make it more and more accurate so we we figured out rigorous ways to actually include things like Professor cancellations and that sort of stuff but the biggest thing we emphasize are what students are actually saying about the environment on campus and the News wasn't great um interestingly michig Technological University ended number one the most elite school that ended uh in the top 10 was University of Virginia University of Chicago always does very well but besides those schools Elite higher education has done terribly last year the dead last one was Colombia um and this year it was Harvard but Harvard really scored abysmally like it earned that because for example pen Penn uh uh University of Pennsylvania in in in in uh in Philadelphia um has had a really rough bunch of years I mean they're targeting Amy wax is just one of the things that's going on like a tenear professor that they're trying to get rid of um but the students themselves are saying this is an environment where it's really hard to have a discussion about anything important um and of course you know a lot of these schools you end up them at the same time having you know being kind of soft on violence and response to speech which might be part of the problem um but University of Pennsylvania which was uh 247 out of the 248 schools that we ranked got a score of like 11.63 U which is really bad um Harvard score was negative 10.67 we rounded them up to zero because we thought that uh because we thought that was a responsible thing to do but they actually scored below zero according to all the different environments uh that that we rank including again most importantly what students are actually saying about the environment at how can you score how can you score below zero how do your scales work I know this is a technical issue but I'm still curious I mean how how was that even possible POS uh we give schools scores for whether or not they support students when they're in situations um when they're when they have their free speech challenged uh and when they have a a speaker disinvited and you get you get negatives for things like dis like if you have a disinvitation and the school didn't do anything to stop it you you you you get negative points and most schools actually sorry all 247 other schools were able to we didn't think there was any risk that that a school could get an actual negative score um because we we do we do these little uh these little adjustments here and there very you know very rigorously to try to um accommodate for the fact that one you know students sometimes go to schools that they think are actually pretty good for Free Speech but actually if you look at the record they're firing tene professors for freedom of speech so like Princeton actually scores surprisingly well um even though they fired tenard or or they forced out Professor Joshua Catz now of course they said that was for sexual misconduct but it's really clear the reason why why he was targeted was because of his calling um I think BLM like a a hate group or something like that um that that's when the scrutiny started and that's what they actually got him out for so they get a ding for forcing out a tenure Professor but the the students there are themselves and this comports you know somewhat with my own experience I actually think the environment is not that bad for free speech Princeton doesn't do great of course um but in uh so we we we include all of these factors together and Harvard you know Harvard's been on our our 10 worst schools for freedom of speech list I think four times already and we've only been doing that since 2011 so nobody it shouldn't have come as such a shock to Harvard that they need they need to fix things and meanwhile you know good good friends like our our our advisory council member step Pinker who's been a friend of fire forever he created a group that was to defend academic freedom and freedom of speech at Harvard I think he got a hundred um Scholars to join it and this is something that actually creates an opportunity for them to be taken more seriously and meanwhile kind of like we as far as schools that we interact with fire has a really good track record of convincing schools to do the right thing sometimes we have to take them to court sometimes it's just public pressure that actually leads them to do the right thing Harvard won't ever budge on any of this stuff and the question is like will the fact that their own students and that their own behavior has gotten them that this ranking will this make them take the issue of academic freedom and Free Speech more seriously and actually honestly Jordan you probably know better than we would yeah well the question is is har is Harvard a university or a hedge fund no I'm dead serious I mean just because something says it's I'm laughing because it's true yeah yeah yeah I mean I'm laughing because it's true like I worked out that that they had something like the GDP of Lithuania you know to one side several years ago and now it's up to many of the Nordic countries like they have like $60 billion or something like that to one side exactly well that's it and I mean at some point the the universities a sideshow and we already might be at that point so that could easily be the case you know I read this great book decades ago called systemantics by a man named John G and it's a great book very very short um tongue in cheek in a way but brilliant and he has a lot of maxims and axioms it's a list of axioms about how you analyze how a system works and one of his axioms which I've never forgotten and has been unbelievably useful to me as an analytic researcher was uh the system does not do what its name says it does and so that when you approach a system you have to look at so if you want to for example figure out what a system does you look at where it spends its money so I learned this when I was working for the Alberta Government 30 years ago 40 years ago as a junior uh analyst I had to gather statistics on how much the social services branch of the government spent on the actual people to whom they were delivering Services right so that would be people receiving welfare and and uh who are being subsidized for kindergarten and so on everything that comes under the rubric of Social Services and I found out that the the that there were no stats the system wasn't set up to actually monitor its own behavior and that the consulting company that had been hired to produce the report detailing those numbers the year before it just basically made them up and no one could tell any different yeah and then I real there were no stats no no no nobody had actually looked at how much was how much the net recipients were receiving right you couldn't find the data no no and I'm sure that's still the case wow oh yes it's beyond belief but it's no different than most Charities you know most Charities spend 90% of their money running the charity now you know I'm not completely cynical about that because most corporations have about a 5% profit margin so that means they spend 95% of their money running themselves you know it's not that easy to get an Enterprise up and running that actually does something other than take care of itself but when you look at a a organization like Harvard and it has that immense Storehouse of money you think well why do they care about being a university what the hell difference does it make there's $60 billion sitting there that's got to be the fundamental preoccupation now that doesn't account for why it's become so insanely politically correct you know and I've talked to Harvard professors one from the Kennedy School which was particularly worrisome given its primary role let's say in determining American domestic in foreign policy and then one from a different department who both told me that one from the business school told me or the Kennedy School told me flat out that the professors there are terrified to say anything they think because the students will skin them alive and then same thing from a Kennedy School person last month yeah well isn't that wonderful you know when it when it was the preeminent well it's just it's just so absolutely appalling and so yeah well we'll see if Harvard responds to any of that they might and they might not it was a great institution when I worked there you know I mean I mean the faculty ran the place the senior faculty that is and the senior faculty were top rate and the second people the second most important people were the undergraduates and then likely the junior faculty then The Graduate students and only then the administration and the administration actually ran the university I'll give you an example so I had a friend who was a professor there uh Patrick Kavanaugh brilliant psychologist in investigating vision and they invited him in as they did with senior faculty members with you know good bonus and and money to set up their lab and he wanted to shower in his lab and they said yes and the reason they said yes was because they were smart and they thought well if we have professors and students who want to stay in their damn lab so long that they don't go home they sleep there and they need a shower it's like okay if you want to work 17 hours a day hey man we'll build you a shower now you know at my last institution the University of Toronto that would have never happened because they would have just thought of that as a luxury because they weren't you know frankly that bright but Harvard was the sort of place they I'm dead serious about that they talked a lot about Excellence but had no idea whatsoever how to facilitate it although they were very good at talking about it and so they put obstacles in the way rather than clearing them out of the way and so Harvard was great and I have no idea what the hell has happened to it in the interim although you know the fact that Pinker felt compelled and he's a very reasonable person and a liberal by any stretch of the imagination he's hardly a right-wing you know some sort of right-wing conspiracy theorist not Steven Pinker and the fact that he felt compelled to set up a whole organization to facilitate free speech at Harvard is another indication of just exactly how Dreadful that place has become alumni should stop giving right that's part of the solution as well especially if they're entrepreneurial or libertarian it's like don't give harv money what when we talk about this um like how maddening it is for me to to to run a nonprofit that we we defend Free Speech you know off campus as well now we we just you know relaunched to expand our mission but we still Focus over overwhelmingly on higher ed and that's still that's always going to be you know Central to what we do and how often I talk to people who are who um they're they'll complain and complain and complain about the schools and that's and then they'll say it's like I'm even reconsidering my gift this year and I'm like you're reconsidering your gift this year um and and a lot of times these are these are gigantic donors yeah well people can't believe it I mean this is what I'm seeing in Canada is that yeah Canadians in my situation I'm being pursued by my accrediting board at the moment who want to take my license or subject me to re-education which is you know just I just can't even believe that this is the case and or how they think that's going to work possibly because I'm definitely not corrigible by standard re-education techniques so but I think Canadians when they look at my situation they have a very hard choice to make and it's the same choice that you're requiring people who are analyzing higher education to make you had in the United States you guys had Stellar institutions man those your Ivy League schools they were knocking it out of the park for a long time and the state school system in California was deadly good for a long long time and so it's a complete bloody catastrophe that those institutions have inverted and and are now actually pedling hard in the opposite direction and it's not the least bit surprising that people can't believe it like I'll tell you a funny story about this so I was in the UK a while back okay and I was talking some of the members of the House of Lords and they're pretty elderly people generally speaking and all of them virtually have had Stellar careers um and they had all been forced to take Dei training and I asked them well what do you mean forced like like you guys are actually only responsible to the queen technically no one can force you to do anything and they said well they told us that we would lose our library privileges we would lose our cafeteria Privileges and we wouldn't be able to park if we didn't take the course really this is actually true and I thought well why didn't you just tell them to go to hell and they said well you know we just thought we we'd had a couple of scandals on the sexual front and we thought maybe it wouldn't hurt us to you know brush up a bit on our conduct and but they had no idea they had no idea whatsoever that there is an entire ideological Enterprise underneath this pushing everything in this insane Progressive Direction they had no concept of that whatsoever and so I think a lot of people who are looking at the universities and the political institutions you know they can either think that me and people like me and that might include you too unfortunately for you are you know just noisy conspiracy theorists screeching in the wilderness or our major institutions many of which were world class and which took hundreds of years to instantiate have now become virtually irreparably corrupt well it's obviously a lot easier to write off the bearers of bad news and sure and unsurprisingly and in Canada you really see that cuz most of our institutions here they worked until well you say 2014 that's probably about right yeah yeah no it it it it is funny watching the various ways you get dismissed talking about this and one of the funniest ones is when people point out that in my book on learning Liberty I talked about 2007 as being the worst year I had seen and that was the one where at the University of Delaware um you know brainwashing program that I mentioned before a crazy case involving someone getting you know expelled for a flyer um another case in which someone uh said the the epithet wet back in class and then criticize to in order to criticize it and was immediately suspended all things that are day-to-day occurrences now and people are kind of like oh but you're saying that things have been you've never seen it as bad but you said that back in 2007 I'm like because they kept on getting worse every several years and you you always have the danger of course of being dismissed as a as a cook or unpleasable uh but it's particularly difficult when you're saying like I've been doing this for 22 years it was already worse than I thought it would be for free speech on campus in 200 one um and it's definitely had Peaks and valleys here and there but the trend line has overwhelmingly been it just gets worse so 2014 was a was a bad year 2015 was 2017 giant acceleration ints to get professors canceled and then that's put in the Dust by 2021 20120 and 2021 and to get to the Dei stuff the idea that in the midst of a of a situation in which there are departments that have literally no conservatives particularly in Elite higher education where they have record low all-time low Viewpoint diversities of viewpoint University among professors when they have cancel culture when they have brts when they have a tenure process that screens out for loud people when they have all of these what we call the Conformity Gauntlet in the book they have all these mechanisms to shut you up from high school for actually from K through 12 on up including nature human behavior saying that they won't actually publish things that are found to be harmful to groups which is just like w survive all that and still not and and they decided in addition to this um that they would add Dei Ms being required for professors um they needed an additional political L test it's like I can't believe any like only an administrator would look at the world of higher education and see you know what there is too much freedom of thought there's too much heterogeneity among among these professors we need a mechanism to make it even more rigid you know I might also add in terms of being dismissed as a a conspiracy theorist for for pointing out these realities I think that the people who I've I've seen to be be most amenable to um these arguments that higher education is just completely turned on its head are young people who don't remember the model that that you both remember of it actually being better at some point in time when you look at the statistics of faith in higher education with Gen Z two-thirds of of current high school students say that they think that they can tread their own educational path less than half of um of current high schoolers say that a college degree is necessary for financial success 100% it's a necessity um and I I mean just the statistics are staggering and and and who can I mean like who can blame young people for looking at the situation in which people feel like they can't speak their minds the Millennials are just saddled in debt we have a system in which H or a third of American colleges produce graduating classes in which the median graduate makes less than the average high school graduate like the system has absolutely been been filled with with federally backed money and student loans the generation above us is crippled the insti are dysfunctional and no wonder young people who then were told oh not only are you going to Shell over an arm and a leg to join this University but now we're going to do the pandemic and what NYU did still charge us still charged us full tuition for Zoom school and that was when my family was like you have our blasting you get right out of there yeah no that was UN that was unbelievable and like I I real I really feel for you in a most fundamental way you know when I was a kid going to school in Alberta now Alberta was a rich place at that point you could make quite a bit of money working in the summer because of the oil industry essentially at at you know elevated salaries I it took me a month's work to pay my tuition for the year and I could make it enough in I could make enough in four months to pay the whole year no problem you know and I worked part-time during school and then I would also say I went to a little College when I first graduated from high school I only have had about 700 people Grand Prairie Regional college and all the professors there loved to teach and my first year classes were seminars and I had a blast it was great and I learned so much I I basically became literate um I knew my professors on a first name basis it was I met all sorts of new people it was great I was you know trumpeting the praise of college to everyone far and wide and it didn't saddle me with any debt I graduated debt-free essentially and also with my graduate uh education because I had a fellowship and so and lived in Montreal which was also dirt cheap at the point at the time and so I was this is no Nostalgia you know I had an excellent low cost higher education experience and I had excellent mentoring in particular as a graduate student it was high quality the clinical psychology program at Migel was like extremely effective and you could do research it was great and then when I went to Harvard I had a blast the students were great I loved my colleagues I thought the university ran like a charm so it's not just you know old guys looking back thinking things were better when we were young it's that things have become so corrupt and so expensive that it's actually it borders on what's being done to young people on the higher education front borders on criminal the bloody administrators figured out how to pick the future pock of the students that's really what happened and so they just elevated tuition fees Beyond any reasonable norm and then to add to that your observation I couldn't believe the universities did this it's like well we're just going to teach you on Zoom which is way worse than a video lecture like way worse yeah and we're going to charge you full tuition mind not to mention like half the kids in my classes were in completely different time zones so they're up at like 3:00 a.m. and they all have their cameras off as well it was just it was an abdication of all of the school's responsibility on just a fundamental level at the same time all of our lives are being torn apart with these wild cancel culture mobs which we talked earlier about whether social media made cancel culture Go arai I mean certainly when you not only have social media as the predominant tool of of of communication going into a pandemic but then you require that it only be the the primary sole communication between people where you no longer have to look at your classmate in the eye and stuff like the the conversations that I saw on on social media even in Zoom chats during lectures like just absolutely rampant out of control antisocial behavior and I think before the pandemic we were all kind of complacent for a while and thinking that you know cancel culture slowed down after 2016 and people often are are very early to Champion that it's over and ended but then we have one little cultural we have a cultural Hiccup and then we're right back to square zero and we're burning the whole the whole house down and carrying people down with it so I think you know 2020 in terms of just the experience of being a young person was really um life-changing for for all of us it wasn't great for the olds either yeah yeah yeah well hence hence your center right libertarianism so let me let me come back and maybe we'll close with this uh let me come back to one thing you mentioned earlier and this touches on the work that uh Jonathan and Greg have done and that Jonathan is pursuing I imagine you guys delve into in your new book too which by the way for everyone listening is coming out October 17th tell me the title again the caning of the American mind oh did you rehears that that that that that yeah that was real good that was real good Counseling of the American mind yeah you mentioned in your you know the first discussion that you had when you went off to University that all the girls that you were sitting around had a history of self harm you know and Jonathan has done a very good job Jonathan height has done a very good job of documenting this cataclysmic rise in self-destructive neuroticism hey here's something that's useful to know so you know in the neop personality questionnaire that it's the gold standard for assessing uh the five dimensions of personality so you know one of the subfacets one of the subfacets of neuroticism so that's the proclivity to experience negative emotion literally one of the subfacets is self Consciousness there's also a very large body of work now that documents the propensity of people who are either depressed or psychotic so seriously mentally disordered in the miserable in the on in the miserable direction are much more likely to use pronouns and terms that are self-referential so they say I and me far more and so it's literally the truth that the more you concentrate on yourself the more miserable you are and of course your generation has been taught to to I identify to put their own subjective self-identification Paramount to do little else but concentrate on their own feeling and to do little else but to concentrate on their own feelings now in your personal experience you you mentioned what happened to you in that first group at University what what do you feel has been the consequence of this what do you see happening around you in terms of the the ongoing conse quences of growing up in social media and this depressive well in particular well let's say for women in particular also for the relationship between young women and young man I mean I I have to say that it feels as though a lot of my cohort is experiencing kind of like a a prolonged adolescence I don't know if that's uh of in part because of the pandemic and and our adulthoods launched uh in just such a bizarre way but I mean I would I would say it's just even still now when I was a teenager I thought you know when we get older we're not going to be mired in the same sort of like depressive malaise I I it's the only word I can really use to describe how I feel like my generation is just like there's this Cloud over us and and it's it's often very negative to be in groups particularly of young women together I mean it's I I remember that night still it was just heartbreaking to me it was UN unbelievable to me that like it was almost like why was I the one person who in this group was not able to share in that experience I mean it's just it's so common it's so pervasive and even as we've gotten older I've not seen it subside I mean I don't I don't have friends that are still cutting themselves like they did when they were teenagers but there's still this this depressive um like downward poll of my generation I I think it's harming our interpersonal relationships I see my especially my female friends I think that we are um certainly more more likely to to indulge in like social contagions and when they sit around together it just gets even more miserable um I mean I completely agree with with what you're referencing with the the gender relationships I think that that's completely ay um I I I mean I feel like we're we're growing up in a in an age where you know the the relationship between male and female is is quite recently changed very dramatically and we're still trying to get our footing on that the way that we communicate with each other is completely upended because we're now completely digitized the political environment around us is so dysfunctional and it's just like I I don't really know what to say about the state of my generation besides it's just it's just Bleak and I'm concerned that it doesn't seem to be getting much better and somehow we just all seem to be folding in on ourselves no you know one of the things I've observed traveling all over the world now for five years is that you know if you try to demoralize young people for 60 years by telling them that their Ambitions are pathological and World destroying and that everything's predicated on Power and oppression you you actually do demoralize them especially when you add to that the vision of a necessary apoc necessarily apocalyptic future brought on by that ambition that can only be rectified by having everyone especially the poor give up pretty much everything they own it's like well we're pretty much done also self-hatred by the way massive amounts of despising yourself just Justified self-hatred as a as a as a parasite on the on the surface of the planet yeah I think we've pretty much had enough of that and we do to end on a positive note you know I mean your situation is instructive you know you took these technological tools that are at your disposal and you're doing that right now and you decided to say what you had to say and you know your future as far as I can tell from the limited time we spent together your future seems to be pretty damn bright and there's no reason that can't be the case for everyone and so it is a very sad situation that we've managed to demoralize young people so badly and to split them apart at the level of sexual relationship and that's a real catastrophe but by the same token and you you'd mentioned this earlier there is a an increasing space for people who are willing to stand up and to make their case known to do that extra with extraordinarily Effectiveness using the tools that are at hand and so maybe that and you know I think fire is one of the organizations that's actually pushing for that outcome to be the one that is going to Prevail I hope your book also Tils things in that direction as your previous book did quite successfully I mean it's had a good run and people still talk about it still sells and so and it did draw a lot of attention to what was going on in universities I know that Jonathan height has got a new book coming out I don't know it's it's well it's got to be in March right and you're right right so there'll be about a six-month Gap e yep yeah yeah well so October 17th tell us the name of the title again see if you can do it in unison I'll give it to you that was creepy the first time the cancelling of the American mind yeah well that would be a catastrophe for the World by the way I mean one of the things you bloody Americans have managed with immense what would you say Panache and to the benefit of everyone is you managed to create a culture where for a long time you aimed at success and you by in large you admired it we're not jealous of it that's a very very very very difficult thing to pull off and if it doesn't happen then no one gets to be successful and when no one gets to be successful then everyone gets to be miserable and that's the situation that we increasingly find oursel in we don't want that to Prevail so I hope we don't cancel the American mind I hope your book is one of the things that helps everyone wake up to the fact that that might happen I hope your generation gets a revitalizing vision and good luck with your book October 17th very ni nice to talk to both of you thank you Dr be thank you so much yeah my pleasure and to everyone watching and listening thank you for your time and attention it's always appreciated I hope you found this discussion useful and engaging and interesting and educational you know all the things that universities used to offer and so and this can offer now um thank you to the film crew here in Florence and uh I'm going to talk continue this conversation for another half an hour on the daily wi plus side so if you want to join us there please you're more than welcome to do so [Music] bye-bye
