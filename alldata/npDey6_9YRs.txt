- [Mr. Beast] Anything you
can carry, I'll pay for. But this time we're gonna mix
in some duos to spice it up. Up first is Marcus and Cooper. Their shoes are tied together. But if one of them drops
anything, they both get nothing. You starting off with electronics? - It's a must.
- [Mr. Beast] Go for it. It's a strong foundation. - Oh yeah, dude. - [Mr. Beast] All right,
you can't put it down. - You can't put it down, brother. - Me? I didn't want a TV. - Yo hands is on it. All right, here we go. - Remember, if anything
touches the ground, you get nothing. Do you want a mouse? - I'd love a mouse.
- How about a headset? - I would love a headset. - Marcus, your partner's
racking up the stuff. - It's okay, patience is virtue. Oh, could I get a drone? - [Mr. Beast] That shoe
is untied, that scares me. - Where are we? I think we should get an Xbox. Bro, you gotta hold this up, bruh. Hey, you tilting it forward. Don't don't tilt it forward. We can't lose any of it. He's not holding his end of the bargain. At all, at all. - Look at that, my style. - So this is the laptop you wanted. - Yeah. - It's getting heavy, whew. - We got the Oculus' over there. - Yes.
- Oh, the VR. - [Cameraman] It looks like
Marcus is holding more weight. - You see it.
- No way. - You see it. - All right, I'm gonna
put it here, is that okay? - That's fine. I'm sweating. - So they have two
PlayStations, an Oculus, a giant TV, a laptop. Should they risk being
greedy and keep going or should they just take what they have? - What do you think? - [Marcus] Man, we greedy. Cash register right there, shorty. - [Woman] Get the TV! - Get the TV?
- [Woman] Get the TV's! - They too heavy to be carrying. - [Woman] No, it's not. - [Marcus] Okay no,
wait, we're just walking. Why are we just walking? We need to be looking. - The cameras are back there. - Where? (starts beatboxing) Let's go to the cameras! - [Mr. Beast] That's a $500 camera. - [Marcus] I need it. - I might need you to
do a little push, push. - A little trip? - Yeah, a little. - A little butter in the
aisle, a little banana peel? - This is a $500 camera. They're racking it up. - Oh, this is getting heavy, buddy. My back is hurting. Look at me, I am sweating. Oh! You better not drop that, boy. - Can we get a pair of Beats, too? - Jimmy, you taking your time. - Get you a pair of headphones. - We gotta roll, we gotta go.
- Let's go. Get out the way. - You got it, you got it.
- Get out the way. Yeah, we out, we out. Slow and steady. - Do you guys want phone cases? - Jimmy, don't trip. Come on, Jimmy. - [Mr. Beast] Guys, you're
in the home stretch. - Watch the shoelaces. - Right here, right here,
right here, right here. - [Mr. Beast] They are safe. (Marcus screams) - Let's go! (laughs) We did it, we did it. Now come untie my shoe, come
untie my shoe right now. - Good job, buddy's. - [Mr. Beast] Pick a store. Don't look.
- I'm not! - [Mr. Beast] Pick. Wait, let me see it, let me see it. Oh my gosh. - [Man] That's gonna
get you a lot of money. - [Jake] What is it? - You're gonna be ecstatic.
- Oh god. - [Mr. Beast] This is what you drew. - It's Victoria's Secret.
- Yes! Here we go! - [Mr. Beast] In order to
make things more challenging, we created the die of fate. - [Cameraman] Safe item. - [Jake] Safe item, what's that mean? - That means you get one item
and I'll carry it for you. - Nice.
- Love that. So Jake.
- Yes. - Grab it. - Uh yeah, I'll grab... grab it. That's me.
- This is you. - [Jake] This is me. - My mom and my wife's
mom watch these videos. - My mom watches these videos. - They're gonna be proud. - This is my safe item,
Jimmy, this is for you. - Okay, 'cause he rolled
it, I have to carry this. This is $60. - It's just a bunch of strings. I'm gonna get one of
these and I'm gonna get one of these.
- [Mr. Beast] Why? - Bruh, these are some
dope sling shots, bruh. - These sunglasses suck. - This is sexy. - [Mr. Beast] Chandler,
what are you doing? Stop.
(Chandler makes ghost noises) Hey, no, hey, get those
panties off your head. - She needs an avocado sponge. - [Jake] She does need an avocado... oh! - [Woman] Likes lipsticks? - Oh, I dropped that. I dropped a sponge.
(emotional music begins) I dropped a sponge, can't get it. - That means you can
only get the safe item. - Oh, for real? - [All] Yeah. - Oh no! Okay, good thing we got the safe item. - Wait, did you not know that if you... - I didn't know. I knew if I dropped it,
I wouldn't get that item. I didn't know I wouldn't
get any of the items. - Chandler. Why didn't you explain the rules? - Because I'm bad at explaining. - Before we start, you
must roll the die of fate. - [Chris] Yay, backpack!
- Backpack. All right Chris, here's your backpack. - [Chris] Thank you. - You know, my dog chewed
up one of my controllers. - Is it Xbox or a PlayStation? Do you want a blue on our gray one? - [Chandler] Blue. - We're not stealing, I promise. I'm gonna get a GoPro
'cause I'm going on vacation and I wanna take videos of me underwater. Should I also get the grip stabilizer? Oh, well I guess I'll just treat myself. - As long as he doesn't drop it. - [Cameraman] What are you getting next? - A MacBook Pro. I don't even like Mac. - I think so far he's spent almost $2,000. So getting a little nervous. - And we got a MacBook. What else do you think I should get? He's doing light stuff. - You said it's Dustin's birthday, right? - Yeah.
- It is. - Let's get Dustin a PC. Oh my God, oh my God. That's so heavy. - Do you need to go to the register? - No, not yet. - What else do you want?
- I'll figure it out. - Here you go, do you want a monitor? - [Chris] Slide that up there. - You want like a ninja turtle. - Chris, you sure? You could get more stuff, you could. - My arms are falling off! - You could spend another
thousand dollars, all right. - [Chandler] He made it.
- There we go. and the competition is over. Anything he could carry, he got. - That was complicated,
my arms started to hurt. - $5,312. I can't pay you this month. - Sorry buddy, I got
you a controller though. - Yeah, I can't eat a controller, Chris. - I appreciate you buying
me all this stuff, man. - Not me, the merch. Without it, I wouldn't
be able to afford this. Chandler, it's your turn. Draw a store. Don't look, don't look. Draw. - Hey. - [Mr. Beast] Chandler drew Walmart. It's time to roll the die of fate. - [Chris] Oh.
- [Chandler] Are you freaking kidding me?
- Oven mitts. He rolled oven mitts. (laughs) Put on the mitts. - [Cameraman] Look at that. - This is Gorilla Tape, too. - [Cameraman] Show us what
you got here. (laughs) - Chandler is now mitted
up and touching me weirdly. Anything you can carry, I'll pay for. - Chandler, loaded bacon and cheese- - No, no, no, don't touch me. Hickory barbecue. - [Cameraman] All right, you can't put that down now.
- This is my baby. - [Cameraman] There's lots of candy here. - Would that be smart? - Yes.
- [Cameraman] Bubble gum? - That would be extremely smart. - [Cameraman] All right,
you can't put it down now. That was a dumb idea. You don't even have... you
don't have hands anymore. Don't drop it, Chandler. Chandler, this was a waste. - All right boys, here
we go, the holy grail. - [Cameraman] Chandler,
you're getting pretty high up. Chris spent five grand,
you've spent like $40. - I wanna put that underneath everything. - There's literally no way. - [Cameraman] Oh, I
thought that was Chandler. That was Chris. Chandler, the trade off. - You can't suck that hard. You do suck, but not that hard. - [Mr. Beast] All right
Chandler, I feel bad. Go to electronics to get one
expensive thing, come on. - It's getting kinda heavy. - Yeah, let's do that. (Chandler shouts) - I just touched you. Why did you react that way? - [Mr. Beast] Chill,
you're making a scene. - [Chris] Chandler, you lost. - [Cameraman] It's literally glued on. - I was just trying to help
you get the Harry Potter- - You scared me. - How did I scare you? - 'Cause you tickled my neck. I won't be able to eat for a week. He said he didn't have
money to pay me to eat. - I got an iMac. - I got sweaty hands. Okay, somebody... - [Chris] No, we're just gonna watch. - Sadly, you fumbled the bag. Next store. Pick your store. I think one of them's a tractor store. - GameStop, whoa! - [Mr. Beast] Okay.
- [Chris] Dang. There we go. - [Chris] After you. - You want a cute purse?
- What? Absolutely. - [Cameraman] Okay, well don't drop that. - I'm not dropping it. - [Mario] Let's a'go! - Oh my goodness. - What is this? - Do you know what this is? - (voice slowed) What is this? - This is a Saiyan Scouter. - Well, you put it in my hand so now I can't let go.
- There you go. I want my Nintendo Switch! Sega, got the Atari. - [Mr. Beast] Time out, we
forgot to have you roll the die. Guys, she forgot to roll
the die, what do we do? - The sun's 93 million miles away. - How are we gonna resurrect her? - [Mr. Beast] I forgot,
you guys are not helpful. Can you roll this? - [Woman] Absolutely. Three minutes?
- [Mr. Beast] Three minutes. Okay, starting now, three minutes. - Can I get a PS3, a
Nintendo and a Switch? Give me that egg. - [Staff] You want an egg?
- [Woman] I want an egg. - All right. - [Mr. Beast] Oh God (laughs) Well, I think you just tapped out. All right, well we... - [Manager] Are you guys
recording in the store? - She has a minute and a half left. You leave, we're not allowed
to record in here, go. - [Chris] That's a GameCube controller. - [Woman] Let's get another one. - All right, she has a full load. We couldn't record. - [Cameraman] Look at that. - That's it. - She maximized the square footage. - So you might be wondering,
where did this all come from? - GameStop. - No, actually it came from
shopmrbeast, go buy right now. It's redemption time. Chandler gets Target. Roll the die. Safe item. Now this one has a little twist because Target always kicks us out. So if we get kicked out
Chandler, you get nothing. If you drop anything or get
kicked out, you get nothing. Also you get a safe item. If we get kicked out, you
still get your safe item. (clock ticks) - [Staff] Hey guys,
you have get permission from Target to video in here. - That was record timing,
that was like 10 seconds. - [Chandler] It's like
he knew we were coming. - Chandler, we got kicked
out so you don't get anything but you still get one safe item. So we'll go to Shoe Carnival,
grab your safe item. You never grabbed your safe item. - I never even got in the store. Come on, let's go. - [Mr. Beast] Chandler's
try not to get kicked out. - Oh no, no. They're coming, they're coming. They're coming, they're
coming, they're coming. - [Mr. Beast] I think we've been spotted. - [Cameraman] Oh god,
we have been spotted. He's right behind you. - Dude, they're closing in on- - [Man] Mission failed, we'll get 'em next time.
(emotional music begins) - Wait, you're not kicking us out? - No, heck no!
- [Mr. Beast] Oh, thank god. We were hiding from you guys. - Don't hide, go have fun. I'll see you later. - Unlike Target, these guys aren't anti... - Mr. Beast.
- [Cameraman] Anti-money. - Anti-fun, anti-sales, anti-revenue. - Hey, do you shop at Target? Well, you should stop. - [Cameraman] You didn't say that. - I didn't.
- These are my opinions. - [Cameraman] These are his opinions. - Oh, hold on a second. Drain this shot. - [Cameraman] Yo, he drained it! - [Man] Kobe!
- Let's go. I'm gonna give these away. - [Cameraman] Ooh, okay. Some fire in that box. - [Mr. Beast] We're here at Best Buy again and this time, it's the cameramen. - Oof. - They've been holding the
cameras the entire video so it is your turn. Zip tie their hands together. - Don't make it too tight
'cause I'll get claustrophobic and drop everything, everything. - [Mr. Beast] You heard
the man, make it too tight. - Please don't make it tight. - All right, stop being
a cameraman and go shop. - All right, let's do it.
- Let's go. - If you drop any... oh, oh. - We're not on the same page. All right, you ready?
- This way. - One, two, three. Do you wanna do a TV?
- TV. - All right, let's do a TV. Here, rock, paper, scissors for the TV. - [Both] Rock, paper, scissors, shoot. - I'm getting the TV.
- He got the TV. - [Mr. Beast] Okay,
wait, wait, wait, wait. There are $2000 TVs over there,
you sure you want a $300 TV? - So the nice TVs, you gotta call for. - TV! - [Mr. Beast] This is $600,
it's a hundred dollars off. I'd go for that one.
- [Tariq] All right. If this touches the floor, this is over. - If this touches the floor, you're doomed to being cameramen forever. - Is my hand on your hand? - Your hand's on my hand.
- Wow, we're holding each others hands. (laughs) Oh, camera bag because
my camera fell in poop. All right, hey Louis, I
think we're doing great. - We are. Can we set it down? - No, no, no. - [Mr. Beast] Do it and
you won't get anything. Tariq, how mad would you
be if he set that down? - I will cry real tears. Real tears. - [Louis] I'm actually losing
circulation to my hand. - Are you really? Me too. (laughs) Be careful. Louis, I love you, Louis
please, I love you. Let's go to the register now. - [Louis] The counter's right there, the counter's right there. - [Tariq] The counter.
- [Louis] The counter. - No, that's not a counter,
we gotta go through the line. Yes!
- [Louis] We did it! - Oh my God. Yo, this is the hardest
challenge ever, dude. Please save us, dude. This was the most painful part. Good job, man. - Chris spent more money by himself than both of you combined. - I've had a lot of experience
spending your money. - I'll get to Chris's level one day. Thank you to all the
fans that buy the merch. Without you guys, I wouldn't get a TV or a PS4 or any of that nice stuff. So thank you guys, appreciate it. Subscribe. - ShopMrBeast. - And now Bed, Bath and Beyond. Get behind each other.
(upbeat music begins) - Ooh, I feel your cheeks on my cheeks. - Thanks. - This one's different. For this one, Chris and Chandler... will be duct taped together. - Careful. - They work as a unit. If Chandler drops anything,
both of them get nothing. - Chandler, I wanna get some
bed, some bath and some beyond. Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. I got on flip flops, I
can't walk backwards. Hermit crab. - Oh God, don't do that, don't drop him. (Chris screams) Let Chris be the front walker. - I got flip flops on. - (growls) I hate walking backwards. - Chandler, I have to pee. - I'm gonna punch you. Take a break.
- Wait no, we gotta get... - [Cameraman] Right in
the middle of the road? - Just take a break in
the middle of the road. - All right, stop moving. My stomach's making me throw up. - [Mr. Beast] You guys haven't
even gotten inside yet. - But really though, can I go pee? - Let me drop something real quick and then you can go pee. No. - [Cameraman] Let him pee, let him pee. - No, the Gucci flops! No! - None of this is appealing to me. - [Chris] I've always wanted an iRobot. - No dude, it'll map your house out. - [Chris] I always wanted a robot. - The government owns that. - Chandler, don't let the
government take him over. - No, I always wanted a robot.
- No. The government will map your house out. - Why are your being are difficult? It's in my house.
- You know a defense agency makes those, right? - [Cameraman] You know
what else they make? - Roombas. - Our country's safe. If the government wants to keep
my house safe, let's do it. - You're moving out anyways
so I guess it's okay. - All right, there we go. I like these sponges. Really good for doing dishes. What is that? - [Mr. Beast] Wait, we
need these at the office. - Yeah we do, wow, look at that. This is the beyond. - I want the lamp.
- [Chris] Okay. - [Cameraman] That's a nice lamp. - Hey! (growls) - [Mr. Beast] I need you
guys not to drop anything 'cause I really want those outlets. - [Cameraman] Yeah, we gotta
get these outlets, guys. - All right, go, go, go, go. - Wait, we didn't get my Roomba. - I don't care. It wasn't meant to be. - Where's the Roomba at? - It's up top. I'll go get it real quick,
I'll go get it real quick. - What's your name? I love you, Will. - I think you should just put it down. - No, the Roomba will happen. - [Chandler] Turn, turn. - [Mr. Beast] Where are
you gonna put the Roomba? - I'm about to drop this blanket, Chris. - Chris...
- It's falling. - Chris, it's sliding. Chris, is it worth the risk? - If you're about to drop
it, just yeet it up there. - Wait, has he put anything down? - No, it's hovering. - [Cameraman] Oh, he just did.
- Did he? - Oh no, he did. - Dude, Chandler, what are you doing? Never mind Will, Chandler
sucks, I'm sorry. (tape rips) - Oh gosh. Oh, I'm dizzy.
- I got it. We did it. I'm sweaty. - My diaphragm is now dented. Dented, I say. - You're probably wondering,
where did this money come from? - I am wondering and guess what? I was not wondering, I
really know the answer. - What is the answer? - It's shopmrbeast.com. - No, it actually came out of my pocket. - Yeah but where did the... - Oh, the money got in my pocket from shopmrbeast.com? - Yeah, yeah.
