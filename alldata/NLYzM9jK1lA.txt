hi everyone in this video we're going to be quickly rendering out some images of the armor we modeled last episode just to use as icons for the games inventory so I have a new blender file open here and I'm just quickly going to delete the default cube and light and only go into file append and navigate over to the player blend file go into object and I just want to append the plate leg plate body and helmet alright so the pen those and with all of these selected miscrit press alt G just to position those all at the center of the scene I could get rid of this armature here and also only move each of these onto their own layer so I'll leave the plate legs on layer one and then have the plate body on layer 2 and the helmet on layer 3 alright I'll now press 1 to go into front view and then ctrl alt 0 to snap the camera to my viewing position in the render settings over here I then want to change the resolution to something square say 800 by 800 and then I can just select this and say scale it up to fit this little camera window and then let's press render and see what happens so it's rendering out completely black since there's no light enough sin I'll go into the world settings here and just add some ambient occlusion say with a factor of 0.8 and if I render this out again I can just press f12 to do that we can see we're getting quite a nice rendering so the only thing I want to do is just make a transparent background so I can go into these shading options here and just change alpha to transparent and then if I render this again the background will be transparent now currently the render is a little bit grainy so we can go back into the world settings here and just up these samples under the gather settings so if I change that to 10 for example press f12 you can see that's a bit higher resolution so I want to save this image so I can just go to image over here and save as image I'll and of course and just choose where I want to save this on my hard drive and I'll give it a name say plate legs icon and press save then let's go back to our 3d view go into layer 2 this is the plate body I'll scale this up to the correct size and press f12 all right that looks good so I will save that as well call this the plate body icon and then we just need to go on to the last layer scale this up as well maybe move it up a bit f12 and let's save that so this is the helmet icon ok so that is actually already everything for this episode I will be sure to save this blend file so that we've got our camera and light settings set up for when we next want to render out some more icons but for now there is everything so until next episode Cheers
