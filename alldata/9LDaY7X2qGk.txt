ladies and gentlemen I have some very very bad and very scary news and it has to do with chat GPT many of you have probably used chat GPT some of you may live in places where chat GPT is banned Chad gbt is a chatbot and it does pose an existential threat to some jobs and some walks of life as this growing functioning Beast a brain of humankind if you will but it can't play chess it can't play Chess at all I've made multiple videos exposing it and showing how ridiculous it is when it goes up against Martin bot or even itself or stockfish that's all finished my friends I have very very very troubling news chat GPT not only can play chess now it nearly defeated me in a game in today's video I'm going to show you chant GPT 4 the new and improved version of chant GPT against Gotham chess myself and how I nearly lost and nearly lost means that I will probably lose in the future also one quick small announcement if you're lucky enough to watch this in the first few days that the video is out I've been announcing a lot of things my book is out now and we've got live fan events in New York City I just dropped a new course it's called tactics master class that are over 400 exercises 7 hours of video you can check out the free sample in the link below but also um the TAC course is mainly that was a weird lag the tactics course is designed for people that solve a lot of puzzles but can't actually see tactics in their games so definitely check it out all courses are 25% off for the next 3 days to celebrate the launch of the new course uh and if you don't want the new course and you just want to see Gotham versus chat GPT look no further okay my YouTube channel is my biggest marketing platform so I'm telling you all of this now we get it out of the way here we go ah oh my goodness this is very scary so I started off against Chad GPT uh by playing the move E4 normal stuff so far now I have no idea what to expect but generally chat GPT plays E5 in the four kns Chad GPT played C5 okay and uh and that already was kind of a big you know warning sign for me uh so I played Knight to F3 and it played D6 we are entering Cutting Edge Mainline Theory Bobby fiser Gary Kasparov Magnus Carlson just the name a few have played this version of the Sicilian Defense all right we are going to enter either the knorf or the dragon so I play D4 and I told chat GPT we're playing an open Sicilian because I thought listen as the chess teacher of the internet you know the the the book uh you know with uh two two billion total views on chess I got to educate Chad gbt 4 and it said yeah I know we're playing the uh open Sicilian stupid C takes D4 I was like oh my God okay Knight takes D4 Knight F6 attacking my Pawn in the center Knight C3 A6 now chant GPT just said I play A6 to potentially prepare B5 expanding in the future and I told it hey Chad GPT you know that we're playing the nidorf Sicilian right I'm actually going to play Bishop to E3 which is the most popular move this is known as the English attack Queen D2 F3 and long castles is my plan and and I played Bishop E3 and I swear to you I told chat GPT that and it said indeed we've entered the night or variation of the Sicilian Defense and Bishop E3 is a well-known and aggressive setup aiming to prepare queenside castling and launching an attack I will respond with E5 challenging your knight and aiming to grab some space and then it proceeded to tell me that players like Bobby Fischer Gary Kasparov and Magnus Carlson have played this opening and I was like oh my God it knows way too much so in this position I retreated my knight to B3 and chat GB played Bishop to E6 and said that it was preparing active intentions on this diagonal and supporting the center yo this thing knows way too much I don't know when that happened I played Queen D2 it played Bishop E7 I castled and it castled then I played F3 telling it that I was supporting my center and preparing a kingside expansion and CAD chbt played Knight bd7 when it played Knight bd7 it said develop my other Knight your move and I said I'll play King B1 do you think that is a good move and it said King B1 is a typical move in positions like this especially when the King has castled Queen side it moves the king to a slightly safer square and clears the C1 Square for a rook or a bishop in some lines it's generally considered a good prophylactic move indirectly preparing for any potential complications in the center or on the queen side and now I will respond with B5 ini initiating a pawn storm on the queen side and looking to open lines against your king your move um chat GPT used to violently have diarrhea and vomiting at the same time and I apologize if you are eating something at home but you have to understand chat GPT used to be the equivalent of a 2-year-old in diapers this is horrifying this is absolutely horrifying I played G4 on my next move which is a direct countermeasure and I said now we're both attacking each other have any games occurred in this position before and it said G4 is a strong aggressive move initiating action on the king side and aiming to open lines against my king the position on the board is a well-known type of position that has occurred in many games especially in the night or variation redundant but we get it the exact position have definitely occurred uh in high level games as this type of Pawn structure and set of plans are quite common in these types of Sicilian positions we're both engaging in Pawn storms on opposite Wings which is typical in positions where we have opposite side castling the game is likely to become very sharp and tactical from this point forward I'll respond with Knight to B6 aiming to reposition my knight and potentially support Pawn advances on the queen side let it be known that Knight to B6 and everything it has done thus far is the top choice of stockfish that is absolutely ridiculous so in this position I played the move Pawn to G5 and it has an option of going here which is generally the best move in these positions because you can then put your knight here it also stops H4 H5 but it played Knight fd7 which I had a feeling was not the best move in all likelihood so I asked chat gbt why did you play that why did you play Knight fd7 and I followed up with H4 and chant GPT said about this move regarding your question Knight to H5 is indeed an interesting alternative aiming to reroute the Knight to better squares and potentially exchange one of your attacking pieces one of the potential downside of this move is that it might allow white to play G6 no that's incorrect with the idea of opening the H file the Knight on H5 could become a target of attack okay good in in in practice not exact in its you know but it basically said I didn't want to put my knight here because it could be a Target so I'm going to play Knight FD okay okay I played H4 so I played the move H4 here taking a little bit more space on the side of the board I'm ready to play H5 now keep in mind I am not an open Sicilian Defense player right now we are both Pawn storming each other possibilities for black include the immediate B4 which would send my knight to D5 and then maybe black would try to play something like this which is very aggressive and very scary I would likely move out of the way but this attack is still knocking on my door Queen C7 Rook C8 Knight C5 very potent position for black another possibility here after I played H4 is Knight C4 and uh I was deciding which Bishop I was going to give away I was leaning to give away this bishop but I wasn't so sure what would happen with this B file but the more I analyze this I mean I'm not going to get M it because the bishop is covering but you know I would need to play King A1 Queen C7 Knight E2 Queen B7 Rook B1 probably and I would need to survive this attack Chad gbt 4 played Rook C8 again it is keeping completely even with me and at this point I decided look I don't want I'm actually have no idea what level it is by the way it's playing like a 2200 2300 easily it's not got the fullest understanding of the Sicilian but I'm in a completely equal position against the chatbot on move 14 like this is unprecedent unprecedented levels of good chess so I played Knight to D5 and the idea of this move was let's just trade some pieces I know it's going to take and then this and then Bish F five right so I played Knight to D5 and um and I thought all right you know let's uh let's trade off some pieces let's be in good shape so if Bishop takes then of course I will just get kind of cart blanch but then Knight C4 and I thought takes takes and I would play Knight to C1 my other idea here was just to play something like this and get a position where I'm restricting Black's pieces maybe F4 maybe bishop D3 in the future uh Chad gpg took my knight and then said I'm repositioning my Bishop to Target your Pawn guys this is crazy it is 16 moves and chat GPT still has a full grasp of the position admittedly it's GP it's gp4 but like this is this is nuts how is it playing this well so I played Bishop D3 it took I took and it played F5 which is still one of the top engine moves the others are queen C7 and Knight to B6 and I mean again we are attacking each other on opposite sides so it's a very tense position very big fighting game right now where it's almost like we need to study the tactics master class from Chesley available right now at 5% off I'm just I'm just kidding but seriously great course and if you don't have it yet check out the free sample all my stuff you can check out for free uh F5 and so in this position I thought all right I can reroute my Bishop there but I decided to play this pawn move F4 and I was going to see is it going to keep the tension is it going to take the best move for black here is not to touch this Pawn because if you touch it you give me a Target if you go E4 you open up too many squares in your position like Knight D4 Knight E6 the best move is to keep the tension just keep the tension line up your queen here so I played F4 and I asked chat gbt do you think F4 is a good move it said F4 is a double-edged move on one hand it supports your Center and restricts my Pawn on E5 making it difficult for me to Advance on the other hand it also weakens your own King's position slightly and opens up potential targets for sort of kind of the position is becoming highly complicated and sharp with chances for both sides it is crucial to stay vigilant and calculate variations accurately in such POS positions and E4 and I explained to Chad gbt here this was a bad move because despite the immediate effect of attacking my queen black has now locked their Center pawns and black is preventing the pieces from getting any form of activity so this is a shortterm move and not a long-term move and I explained that and said your observation of the position has been insightful upon p on e4 does indeed restrict my mobility of Knight and Bishop and creates a fixed Target for your pieces however it also gains me space in the center and challenges pieces potentially creating opportunities for me as well your move Queen E2 is a good choice retreating the queen to a safer Square while maintaining pressure on the E4 Pawn not really but for the most part good now at this point unfortunately chant GPT decided to malfunction first it played Knight to E5 and I said chat GPT that's not a good move uh because of this and so I reminded it where all of its pieces were I literally said here are where I got my pawns here are my Queens blah blah blah blah blah and after I explained everything it tried to eat its own Knight I told it it couldn't do that so it proceeded to hang its own bishop and I thought okay I thought you know what that's the end that that it was a fun video while it lasted but you know now it's going to start playing like actual Chad gbt if you haven't seen my videos on actual Chad GPT CAD GPT just throws pieces all over the board from multi-dimensions and crazy stuff happens this is not what happens here I was going to play as hard as possible okay so I told it that was not a good move because I can just take your Bishop right and uh it proceeded to play Rook takes F6 and my friends it literally started playing completely like normal it just basically had this moment here it didn't really know what to do it lost track of the position watch this takes takes and I said Rook G1 now since black lost the bishop I'm a piece up this is open I'm just going to Barrel in this way there are two ways to win a winning position trade everything and win an end game or go directly for a Checkmate a brutal assault on the enemy King it played Queen C7 and I played Bishop D4 and it said I'm playing Rook F7 defending my king oh my God and so here I realized that you know it kind of malfunctioned and gave me its Bishop so what if I gave it a bishop back right of course the best thing here for white is to play H5 Rook G3 Rook go here Rook G1 if black ever goes here that becomes a hook which is a pawn in front of an enemy King that you can Target with your own pawns or pieces and yeah black is obliterated Rook H1 Queen H2 just ma is coming I mean you will win you know so I decided to sacrifice my Bishop I played Bishop takes G7 and when I played this move uh it said it's an aggressive move capturing the pawn and attacking The Rook not exactly but then it said this this this Okay the reason this position is still slightly better for uh for whites is due to the infiltration along the G5 F and Knight D4 and Knight E6 and I thought okay I'm still going to win this game no matter what because there is no chance this bot is going to remember this position no way right I mean it can't be that good I estimated to be playing at around 2,000 strength minus that random Bishop blunder where it threw a tantrum so I played Knight to D4 my friends in this position with Knight E6 Knight F5 Queen G2 Rook G1 coming I thought the game is over it's going to last five more moves Chad gbd played the best move Queen C4 that's actually the second best move in the position Queen C4 is the second line of stockfish now stockfish says go Queen H5 play Rook G1 play Knight so what did I do I played one of the other you know good moves which is Queen G2 Czech and Cat GPT in this position I did not think it was going to play the best move five moves to choose from the top engine move hiding the king in the corner and I realized my plan doesn't work I just thought Rook G1 but Rook G1 loses because of this defending Checkmate and I went wait a minute cuz I didn't play with the eval bar I didn't play with the eval bar you I played it I just relaying I thought Queen G2 Rook G1 boom then I went whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa I can't play Rook G1 anymore so let me go C3 because I thought I play C3 and then Rook G1 and then mate and I just thought there there there's no way Chachi bt4 took my Pawn I did not think that it was going to see that not only now am I not winning I'm a pawn down I'm a pawn down to chat GPT the chat GPT that could barely remember where any pieces used to stand the chat GPT that would invent where pieces are it has not made a single illegal move it tried once it had a little tantrum I realized if I go here it's just going to play Rook G8 I can take I can take I can go Knight F5 but I'm not going to win this end game if King F7 Knight takes D6 King E6 Knight takes C4 King F5 look at this I'm not I'm not going to win this game King G3 H5 so I decided okay Queen G5 Chad GPT now played Rook to f8 and I thought look the only chance I have is probably playing H5 6 and Rook G1 so I played Pawn to H5 it's the only way I thought it's it's but it's it's keeping equal with me for 30 moves I'm a 2300 rated Fay M oh my goodness I just demoted myself wow Freudian slip International Master 2300 is a fiday master uh level and I recently have been playing at Fay Master Level I play at GM level occasionally like CAD GPT but then for the most part I play Garbage uh I demoted myself there you go uh International Master uh which you know my highest was 2430 we don't talk talk about that lost to a bunch of 10-year-olds you're welcome 10-year-olds and I thought what how good is this thing this thing used to play at 300 level it plays E3 and so I thought the only way to stop this Pawn is to go Queen E7 it turns out this is wrong turns out that this trade of Queens is actually good for black I thought it was good for white because I would play F5 turns out that after Rook G8 Rook G1 it can just hold on to its pawn and I can never touch the pawn and then it's going to go here and bring the king now luckily it doesn't play End games like Magnus Carlson and instead it lost its Pawn on E3 now here's something funny happened here chpt started doing weird things it played Queen E4 check but it didn't just play Queen E4 check it said Queen E4 Queen E4 F4 I was like what chat GPT literally said I'm I'm not I'm not joking it said Queen E4 check Queen takes C4 F takes C4 exchanging queens and pawns your move it made my move for me I who said I wanted to take what if I wanted to play Knight C2 best move defending my pawn and opening up a discovered attack it made my move for me and I thought you know what fine F5 unfortunately now my friends I think sensing its coming defeat sensing that it was losing its grasp of the position chant GPT 4 went rogue it stopped listening because now unfortunately we have to toggle to this board we have to toggle to a totally different board to continue the game from the exact same position this is how I usually record chat gbt videos because you know I'm playing with the white pieces here because its moves are generally illegal and egregious and so my friends in this position Chad GPT played Rook C4 sensing that it was about to start doing some seriously UGA things to me I decided I need to go execute it I need to go kill it with my bare hands before it can do any more damage to myself or itself and I play Rook G1 Rook G1 sealing off the file and I thought F6 Knight E6 I'm going to go Checkmate it it played H6 it played H6 it said I play H6 making a l for my king CH pt4 played punon to H6 and said it's making a l while also playing illegal moves now you got to remember you got to remember something my friends the original version of chant GPT is the one that makes all of the illegal moves you can forgive it because it's basically like a child it's basically like a puppy it doesn't know it's peeing and pooping in the house it can't control those types of things it has no moral code but this chat gbt is chat gbt 4 and it means that it can create good moves humanlike moves and it knows what it is supposed to do and what it is not supposed to do I played Rook G6 in this position it said King to H7 it knows what it's doing it knows what it's doing from the previous move it is defending itself against me so I played Knight to E6 yes that was was a free Pawn but I needed to go after CAD gbt as fast as it played Rook C8 and I thought in this position easy Rook G7 check King h8 I take I push I push I push I win but in this position chat gp4 decided to play Rook takes G7 and that's when I realized it was over but I made a promise to myself I would not resort to the same tactics as chat GPT or chat gp4 I am a good man and I will go down the right way and I played Pawn to F6 and chat GPT did not see this it went here but I decided strategically I will not take the Rook because then it's going to win my pawns F7 losing to Rook takes and then of course promotion is stopped but it played Rook F6 and I took my chance and promoted to a queen it took and I took and in this position chat GPT luckily despite all of that forgot that it had a night and it played King to G8 I took thinking that's it there is no way it knows the rest of the position I'm going to go eat the pawns and I'm going to go win but that is not what happened and yet even from this point there are plot twists this was not the end of the story I thought that I had escaped the worst of it I thought that the barrage of illegal moves would continue it played King F7 it played King F7 and said I am centralizing my position I'm centralizing my king in this position I played Knight to B8 attacking its Pawn thinking it would just absent-mindedly run its King around the board it said good move Knight B8 attacking my Pawn I play A5 what how does this thing still remember where its pieces are Pawn to A5 I played Knight to C6 it said good move attacking my Pawn I play Pawn to A4 oh my God this thing still knows where all of its pieces are and is completely capable of making illegal moves Knight to D4 it's an evil machine which knows that it's making illegal moves it played King to F6 unable to defend its Pawn I played King Knight takes B5 it said good move attacking my Pawn D5 oh my God I played Knight to C7 it said good move d4 but it forgot that I had a pawn there myself C takes D4 and at this point I thought there is no way chat GPT knows it has an E Pawn cuz it ain't moving it it said King to F5 I said Pawn to D5 will it go stop my Pawn I will be irritated King F4 it doesn't know that it has a pawn D6 now the king is outside of the square and I will win easily but I did not anticipate the following sequence of moves in this position it played E3 realizing once again that it does in fact have a past Pawn now I played King C1 because I am in the Square so I can stop the pawn in time it played what did it play you know what it played it didn't play anything in this position chat GPT said I play E3 You'll Play King C1 you're move what it said E3 King C1 your okay don't got to ask me twice I'm playing D7 let's go it played E2 now if I queen it Queens so I played King to D2 it played King F3 and I played d8 making yet another queen now Black's best move is this and I will give a check and deflect the king away my friends what I was not expecting is for chat gbt to to pull some nonsense for a final time you've made it 25 minutes in the video in this position chant GPT promoted to a queen and also made my move for me and said King D oh it's evil now we're in a queen end game I was so close it's like a villain that will not die so I played Queen F6 check and I said you know what you you you stupid SOB if I've got to beat you in a queen end game I will I will beat you in an end game you you you rodent King to G4 Queen takes H6 now I will go check and I will win with the H Pawn in this position chat GPT said I don't have many more moves I will play Queen A1 creating counterplay and in this position I set one more task for chat GPT if it could find this best move it would win the game if if it wouldn't I would win I played Queen G6 check King to H4 and I realized I am on the same diagonal be very careful in Queen end games when you are on the same diagonal as your queen I played H6 now I lose because Chad GPT can play Queen B1 check my queen is no longer defended and it played Queen to H one I gave it one more chance I played H7 at this point this would no longer win the game because I would make a queen but it has one last chance unfortunately it played Queen D5 I proceeded to take with my knight and in this position chat GPT and I quote says I am out of material well played and I said what what do you mean you're out of material well played and it said you're right thanks for pointing that out I still have some pieces left with that in mind I play King to H3 ladies and gentlemen Pawn to h8 Queen ladder Checkmate this is the story of how I played chant GPT 4 and it proceeded to play 33 moves in a completely equal position against me my chess.com Blitz rating is 2700 as high as 2,860 this thing played the Sicilian knorf Main Line Cutting Edge variation which has been played tens if not hundreds of thousands of times at the highest of levels it attacked me it counterattacked my pieces and for nearly 30 moves we were dead equal yes it made a positional mistake yes it had a little malfunction here where it lost its Bishop but the second I gave the bishop back it found Queen C4 Queen takes D5 it was defending itself nearly flawlessly this is terrifying this is both fascinating and terrifying chat GPT is no longer bad Chad GPT knows how to play chess and it knows how to play it very very well check out the tactics masterclass free
