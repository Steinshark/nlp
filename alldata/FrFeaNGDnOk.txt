hello everyone and welcome in this video we're going to be talking about turbocharger blankets and whether or not there can be performance improvements by using a turbo blanket can you make more horsepower can you make torque sooner what does it do the temperature underneath the hood what happens with temperatures yeah so charles you bought this for your gti yes yes what's the logic behind a turbo blanket so the logic behind the blanket is to keep the heat where it's supposed to be the hot side of the turbo charger keep the heat there and keep it away from the cool side of the turbocharger as well as everywhere else in the engine compartment so if we keep the hot side hot we are going to increase temperature increase pressure and with more pressure comes more boost right yeah the the ideal the idea is spool faster and keep everything cooler uh they do talk about horsepower gains on certain vehicles but obviously that's a dynamometer type test uh to prove yes so we're going to get into that at the end of this video there's a cool very cool study scientific you know they used lab coats and glasses and a real engine dyno which i'll talk about at the end of the video uh with like super hardcore real data but we did our own little testing uh because it's fun to do on your own car and see what effects it has so we're first just going to be looking at temperature differences in different locations on the car we're going to be using two tools to do that one of them is this flier t1k camera this is a thermal imaging camera and it's fifty thousand dollars so we're being really careful with it uh i definitely don't own that fear was kind enough to loan it to me this piece i do own not quite as expensive this is uh temperature data loggers so we've got thermal probes in different locations on the car and we're going to measure temperatures at each of those locations the things we were kind of curious about most was what does it do to some of the things right near the turbocharger and how does it change the overall engine compartment temperature so we put a probe right over the hot side of the turbocharger right by that oil line which is right above it right at the oil line there's a coolant line that runs near there which is a factory location and then on the intake yes on the intake right beside it and then one near uh the intake portion of the turbocharger outlet so right coming from the turbo before it goes to the intercooler right so we did we did a bunch of different testing we took it on a drive let the car warm up we then did some pretty aggressive pulls i would say some wide open throttle poles uh for those of you wondering the boost is right around 12 psi average on this car a handful of other modifications too and then we came back logged all our temperatures and used the flear camera you can see really just how hot the turbocharger is yeah so the turbocharger uh itself was getting as high as 500 degrees celsius and so then we put the turbo blanket on top of that and that top the turbo itself when i measured it you know you're seeing somewhere in the 430 degree range to 500 degrees c when we measured this turbo blanket it was only 160 to 200 so you have far less heat radiating out to the rest of the engine and so consequently you can see numbers drop not across the board but in a lot of areas so looking on the compressor side of the turbo we're seeing temperatures around 125 to 145 without a blanket and down to 102 to 137 with the blanket so on average look to be lower on the turbo out intake and on the coolant line we didn't notice a temperature change so around 60 to 70 degrees celsius on the turbo out and 100 degrees c for the coolant line so the coolant line was the temperature of coolant for those i think it's important to note too that the air temperature today is probably in the 20 or so degrees 25 degrees fahrenheit it is very cold and i think that probably is impacting a little bit of what we're seeing underneath the hood yeah i would say so uh and so what else did we have oh we looked at the inside of the footwell as a passenger at your feet what is the temperature going to be like because of the location of the turbocharger and its proximity to the bulkhead we were really interested to see how much heat was radiating into the cabin of the car on a car that doesn't have a heater core at this time versus you know without the blunt without the blanket versus with the blanket and we saw a pretty significant yeah we saw a filter and felt a pretty significant temperature difference with the blanket versus without the blanket yeah so the peak temperature i saw without the blanket was five to six degrees celsius in that footwell right on the other side of the bulkhead and the peak temperature i saw with the turbo blanket on it was minus one to minus two degrees celsius so we were not getting warmed up and in the winter turbo blankets could make you cold if you don't have heat we did this test by first starting with the car stone cold like overnight cold we hooked up all our probes let the car warm up for a couple of minutes took it got the car up to operating temp then we did some moderate to heavy acceleration to really heat soak everything as best we could brought it back did some measurements with the flear camera let it cool down as much as really was necessary once the car's up to operating temperature there's no point in letting cool all the way back down i at that point installed the blanket charles did it and not a team effort it was not a collaboration there uh we put the blanket on and then repeated the same route and the same amount of light medium heavy accelerations to try and really get as close to the exact same scenario as we could during this test it's important to note again that ambient temperature was pretty cold but was consistent i think throughout our filming time those are of course variables that can play into these readings when when we're looking at our data overall but it's affecting our data overall and and in general any effect we would see would be the air temperature would be warmer and since we did testing with a turbo blanket second it would have a negative effect on the turbo blanket results not the other way around which would cause for concern so thankfully we thought about it a little bit right or we just got lucky and happened to do it that way yeah so the results from this data logger so we had those four points we measured at the oil line on average so what we did is we took that that loop run from when we start driving and then the loops that we make and all the hard pools i averaged the temperature of each of these four across that entire driving duration so no time spent idling always driving and averaging the temperatures at each of these four locations on average the oil line was 12.7 degrees celsius cooler the coolant line was 14.9 degrees celsius cooler the air intake which this is pretty cool 3.4 degrees celsius cooler and the turbocharger out basically feeding the intercooler before it gets to the intercooler right out of the compressor was 6 degrees celsius cooler so improvements in every single category and that's where you see that huge benefit of this keeping all the heat within the turbocharger and not letting it escape out into the engine bay and i'm these were kind of the four areas that i was concerned about you know the oil line being one the coolant line being right there as well the one i'm really happy about seeing is the is the intake temperature number that low you know that lower temperature is going to be denser air so that should produce more maximum horsepower and make the car a little bit more fun to drive they do mention you should feel better like a better responsiveness from the car i didn't really experience any change in drivability with the vehicle positive or negative it seemed to behave exactly the same way as it does all the time overall these are minor changes i think but add them all together having a a cooler under hood less heat soak you know less wear on components hopefully and and probably if we were to do these dyno runs seeing a slight percentage increase which you may or may not feel depending on how much money you spent and how soon you installed your part after you spent those monies on the butt dyno okay so those are the results from our testing with charles and i'm sure many of you have seen perhaps one or two flaws with our testing uh i call nonsense i think we did a great job there's no flaws to be uh but it can be done way more scientifically and that's what we're going to be talking about a study out of the university of texas at austin which was done in 2016 with a ptp turbo blanket uh everything is super relevant of which i paid for it this was not sponsored this is not sponsored by ptp yeah uh or anyone and so they took a 6.7 liter cummins diesel and put a turbo blanket on that engine and looked at temperatures before and after they also looked at tip in so applying full throttle and then watching what happens with torque what happens to the turbocharger rpm what happens to boost and so very very cool study very well done and the only difference between testing this is all done on an engine dyno so laboratory controlled results you don't have to worry about external factors the only difference literally the only thing they changed was putting a turbo blanket on uh no engine tuning none of that they purely wanted to see what the effects would be of just putting on a turbo blanket so they looked at seven different locations and monitored temperature the first temperature they looked at was the very top of the turbocharger the surface temperature of the turbo and they saw a 150 degree increase using the turbo blanket so kind of earlier when we were mentioning it holds all the heat in this is the proof of that so the turbocharger itself increased by 150 degrees celsius they also measured the air intake temperature leaving the compressor on its way to the intercooler that remained relatively unchanged they saw a increase by 0.7 degrees celsius but basically a negligible gain for the intake leaving the compressor also somewhat negligible was the exhaust entering the exhaust turbine so it dropped 1.2 degrees celsius uh but really you know not a huge noticeable difference the exhaust gas exiting the turbocharger was about five degrees celsius hotter and part of the reason for this you can see the exhaust itself the actual exhaust pipe exiting the turbo was about 113.7 degrees celsius warmer now they also measured the side of the turbocharger the surface temperature uh the exhaust portion of it and that was 225 degrees celsius hotter so you can really see how much heat this thing is holding in uh pretty incredible and one of the things that was really interesting that they did is they measure the oil temperature coming out of the turbo so you're feeding in oil to keep that bearing lubricated and a lot of people might think if you put on a turbo blanket and your turbo's getting way hotter your oil temperature as a result is going to suffer well interestingly enough there was was almost exactly the same temperature before and after putting the turbo blanket on now this does have this turbocharger has a heat shield between the turbine side and the center uh so that it prevents exactly for this so the idea um it's pretty interesting that you can actually put these on serial benefits and not worry about you know coking your oil uh so that was fascinating to me because i thought one of the downsides might be oil temperature and it turned out in this test it was not yeah so instead of you know that oil coming in and pulling the heat out it's not the oil pulling it out it's going out the exhaust which is is good yeah i think the one thing that you may you know need to actually think about there is letting your engine cool down rather than just going super hard and then shutting it off then your turbocharger is really hot that oil is no longer moving it's sitting right there and then it would likely get warmer the the other side of that though is that's good turbocharger practice whether you have a high performance car whether you have a normal you know average turbocharged car blanket no blanket that's good practice to do period yes absolutely let your car warm down if you've been driving it like crazy [Music] [Laughter] now they looked at all kinds of different data points in this test and one of the ones that i thought was interesting that they did is they took a low load so the dyno applies a low load to the engine a form of resistance to it and a constant torque and then they measure what the engine is doing uh and in all of these scenarios they took five different engine rpm with a constant low load somewhere around like 25 to 30 percent load for the engine and in all five rpm intervals they noticed that the turbocharger with the turbo blanket had a higher turbo speed so it was rotating faster and they noticed that the boost was higher for all five rpm as well so you would expect that with the turbo speed being higher so in all five cases at a low load okay so what happens at full load and this is where it gets really fascinating of what they would observe so it's a tip-in scenario you apply throttle and watch what happens and so really interesting to see at any given point in time the turbocharger with the turbo blanket had about a 200 to 250 rpm engine speed advantage so what does a higher engine speed uh turn into well they saw the turbocharger rpm about 10 000 to 12 000 rpm faster at the same point in time with the turbo blanket than without the turbo blanket so what does that translate to well about 0.2 to 0.3 bar of boost or about three to four and a half psi additional pressure at that given point in time and at one point this was as high as 140 newton meters of torque 100 pound-foot advantage at the same point in time purely because of a turbo blanket and that is fascinating well and that back that legit backs up all the claims of faster spool more power given by the manufacturer which is honestly it's incredible yes and they were saying basically having this turbo blanket on was the equivalent of while you're spooling up not once you get to peak torque but while you're spooling up the equivalent of having an additional leader on this 6.7 liter engine which is crazy so and that's all just from changing this and keep in mind you wouldn't want to just stick this on after you've let's say you were designing it from the start from scratch you would design that turbo specifically for having the blanket so this turbo isn't optimized for having a blanket but it still can make use of it if you were to do it from scratch and say we know we're putting a turbo blanket on this you would design the turbocharger slightly differently to fully take advantage of those changes now does it make more power so here's what's interesting it enabled the engine to get to peak torque faster but ultimately both of them did reach a very similar peak torque so the change wasn't my car has more power it's my car gets more power sooner and so that's that's actually really cool i mean it's it's going to accelerate your car faster because you're getting that power sooner you're getting that torque sooner and as high as 100 pound feet at the same point in time uh advantage so crazy i wish this gave me another 100 pound feet of torque yes unfortunately your engine's not quite as large as a 6.7 liter uh diesel and it isn't a diesel so the torque the torque on a common 6.7 is enormous i think it's something like a thousand newton meters uh even still to see a ten percent over ten percent increase is very cool at a given point in time so this has been fascinating and thank you charles for inviting me uh it's been cool to learn about turbo blankets and their effectiveness not only from our own tests uh real world with you know what happens out there just driving around on any given day with a sweet volkswagen gti which by the way pulls really well when it gets traction yeah wedding construction it definitely likes to spin tires and kind of chase around out there it's it's squirrely is the word i like to use yes it's very squirrely i told that to a race car driver and they looked at me like what are you saying and i said squirrely like oversteer and well i mean this is understeer in this case but you know chases are there exterior is actually i think more accurate steer is also squirrely yeah so anyways you guys should check out charles's channel i'm sure you already have before because he's been on lots of times but check it out and subscribe to him he's a really cool guy he's super smart and he's good looking [Laughter] stay fun stay fun have safe be dirty see you guys bye
