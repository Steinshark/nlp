average rating has to be below something and every team has to have a female player um this was unbelievable I'm gonna show you four games I'm gonna feature a game of each player uh and uh really I like I'm lost for words for how incredibly proud I am of this team we fielded a roster of 10 players I think nine players played one of our players wasn't able to play uh she was uh winning tournaments in Europe uh we fielded a lineup in the playoffs of Hikaru Nakamura Vladimir for the save sham season who's a very strong uh Grandmaster from Uzbekistan a member of the gold medal team and a Wim from Kazakhstan who's just 15 16 years old and her name her name is not Alo normansen I think that's like an anime name her name is ALU and Romanova she's a 2600 Blitz player on chess.com and in this game she be the Women's World Champion the champion of the world in women's chess Juan Jun from China so let's start with this then we will look at some siegen's game then we will look at a way a game played by Big Fish and then we will look at Hikaru um so this is 10 minute rapid format uh nirmandava plays the king's Indian everybody knows she plays the king's Indian she plays the king's Indian all the time and um Juan Jun played in a way where she traded the pieces and she was gonna grind down her young opponent in an end game she was gonna play Bishop G5 she was gonna bring her Rooks she was going to utilize this diagonal and that's exactly what she did she played Bishop G5 uh alua played the move for Rook D7 this is Theory by the way Rook D7 might look very very very dumb because you're blocking your Bishop but it's actually a completely reasonable move uh the Women's World Champ started instigating on the queen side with Knight A4 Knight C5 black played Rook D4 now here for reasons I cannot fully comprehend um Jew and June did not defend her Pawn I really truly do not know what was wrong with the move Rook C1 I don't know also it's very interesting that when I make a move she loses 9 minutes on the clock I guess that's like chess that comes way of saying that this you know move is analysis instead she did this and the idea is quite clear obviously Rook C4 Rook d8 check back rank problems and you lose um but Jew and June went on to just lose this Pawn anyway so after Knight to E4 uh she just she chose a line where she doesn't guard the pawn and alua is the type of player like she's lower rated so because she's lower rated and she's on the team obviously so the average rating balances out but she's underrated because she's low rated people take more risk against her because you know if you're like 1400 and you're playing a 700 you it's not the same yeah but what I'm saying is when you play somebody lower rated Than You by 400 points you're like well I'm gonna win it's just a matter of time right so her opponents very frequently you know allow her to get very commanding positions and actually at some point in this game she was completely winning she was already completely winning and throughout her run she only played Grand Masters and she drew a couple of 2600 in the playoffs she Drew buscar on adiban from India she Drew Benjamin Bach like she was drawing some very good players uh and in this game all of a sudden she was up two pawns she's just up two pawns she has seven pawns Jew and June has five what does Jew and June have going for her number one world champion bonus when you're the World Champ you just feel like an alpha right number two very annoying Queen side pressure now here alua plays E4 sealing out the bishop and opening up her own white plays Rooks rugby one and sets a little bit of a trap here with this nice idea Knight to D2 and now this Rook is dead all right The Rook is gonna die however The Rook might be able to escape by sacrificing for a piece now if you're gonna sack for anything you should sack for the bishop because at least that pawn is a Target and at least your knight can come to D3 and life is not so bad uh but then she played Bishop D4 and she managed to use the E Pawn to break out so now if Rook takes D4 there is this and if you play F take C3 which obviously looks like a very natural move whoopsies and you you don't have time to trap my Rook look if Rook C4 there's even this incredible move a triple Fork of the king in both Rooks I mean it's insane right so Juan Jun plays Rook D4 and a Lua nirmanova is up two pawns against the Women's World Champ not only is she up two pawns she is able to use her b-pawn play Rook A5 so that her Bishop can be taken and when the Bishops are traded she puts the Rook behind the pawn she brings the king Boots the rook and that is GG she was over 2200 takes down the number two player on uh the Shanghai tigers which is Juan June our board four takes down the Women's World Champ I mean this is Sensational stuff while that has been happening in a different match I'm taking you through all the playoff matches we we had a match against India we also played St Louis by the way St Louis archbishops that was our closest matches AKA Shield 12 has an uncanny ability to get himself into a total position of total chaos he was playing the board number one of mgd1 which is another team we played in the playoffs and the position that they had out of the opening looks something out of a sci-fi movie what is happening here why are these pawns scattered all over the board and the bishop and our generic guys he played a brilliant idea which is C5 and just absolutely wrecked Black's position look at the position it's move 19. sham season has pieces on the back Rank and he only has three minutes on the clock but he is such a creative Defender Rook A2 hitting the bishop But Here Comes the queen hits the Knight hits The Rook hits the pawn which hits the rook and queen A4 check he just moves his King he's not castling two minutes remaining on the clock for shamsidian against the board number one of the Indian team this is ridiculous by the way did I mention that you could get the courses for 50 off hello 94 Rook to B8 King G7 and I pulled up to this game right around this moment look at look at this move this man shamsidian is is dead lost Rook is hitting the queen Queen's gotta go to the center then Knight D3 is a fork so the queen can't go to the center so the queen has to go to A8 then you play Rook B2 and queen D4 check this Manchester Rook D5 plays Rook B4 that is such a ridiculous move if you take his Queen he takes your queen you take his Rook he takes your rook and suddenly he's better Rook B4 is a ridiculous move to play it with one minute on the clock and all of a sudden the position is utter chaos make no mistake every guy see is still better Queen takes G4 check Queen G5 look at this Queen G5 and black Against All Odds But Here Comes F4 it's a fork but he just gets out of the way in time and covers up his King Bishop E7 look at what he does look at what what is even going on how is shim season surviving with six seconds on the clock we have our board four beating the Women's World Champ in a different matchup we have shamsidian creating a Tetris piece of chess pieces Knight D6 check King f8 94 94 back King E8 our air guys he's looking for a way through he right here 94 is winning if he brings out apologies apologies apologies uh uh uh you have to play Knight A4 Knight C5 that is the winning idea the winning idea after bringing your king to the center like this for white is to play Knight A4 and Bishop takes A4 looks like a free Knight and then G4 and the point is that if the queen takes on G4 Rook d8 bishop d8 and you have Knight D6 and queen F7 mate the queen is no longer defending uh that square so you have to play Knight A4 Gambit this and play G and that's just not findable uh with 30 seconds on the clock and Eric icy all of a sudden is back to an equal end game and I got news for you it gets even worse than that because what Shram seeden has is a bishop versus a knight and a past Pawn a bishop verse tonight is already advantageous in the end game because the bishop is a long range piece but having an outside pass Pawn when you have a bishop versus a knight in the end game is also advantageous because the Knight is going to struggle some tremendously to stop the outside pass Pawn so shamsidian has the benefit of the doubt he can trade the Queens basically at any moment and we have a monster game where the pawn walks down to A3 and Against All Odds it is stopping White's pawns and winning this game this man let me tell you something right now this man had zero business winning this chess game zero bro look at his position after 20 moves he got no development government he got two minutes on the clock but he found clutch moves like rugby I mean what Rook B4 is a move sent down to the human Realm by the chess gods Rook before he he should make an nft of that move and it will either sell for 200 000 to some random people you've never heard of or it will be worthless but that's just you know nfts in a nutshell um Rook B4 is ridiculous and I mean he will he was a and he ends up winning the game he wins the game because white cannot stop his Pawn Shield 12 AKA from seating walking up aka the board three for the New York Knights uh Gotham Gotham Knights New York guys was ridiculous now the MVP of the team the man who won the MVP award in the entire season and won another five thousand dollars Vladimir for the safe frequent battler of Hikaru plays Blitz all the time I have a horrible record against him my record against big fish is two and a half wins and 21 and a half losses I am 2 and 21 against the fact that I've even beat him twice should go on a statue and he's playing the board one of of of uh the team from China Shanghai this is way Yi waihi is like a top 30 player in the world big fish in this game and just throughout the pro chess League played perfect matches like he won 3-0 he was our board too and he won all his games now there was this game where Wei very clearly is trying to launch an attack at his opponent and fetus save is standing there with the black pieces like do your worst come on fire away let's go you play G4 I'ma chop the Knight I'm also gonna strike at the center what are you gonna do right so Wei plays King H1 now you'll notice whoa what the heck was that why did the board refresh the move King H1 was played with one minute and 30 seconds on the clock and fedes just P5 principled move C5 now here comes way Yi watch how fedesev Ducks under the punches manages the distance and lands absolutely brutal counter punches to win this game Bishop D7 back is a ridiculous move right excuse me I meant to say not a ridiculous move I just forgot a word this is a very natural move it's not a ridiculous move uh White takes on D5 now watch as far asev takes advantage of one inaccuracy and absolutely obliterates the white position he takes this Knight then he takes that Knight and he plays Bishop C6 he offers a queen trade freezing the white attack completely in its tracks and here comes the Avalanche of Rooks and I got news for you I'm all I'm not only taking this Pawn it's impossible to protect this one so I'm gonna get that one too if you try to defend this Pawn you know what I'm gonna do get in here with my Rook C4 you now cannot move these two pawns this is called a queen side majority I have three pawns versus two and not only that I'm gonna get my Rook to your second rank which is very dangerous in end games by the way endgame's Master Class coming to Chester you excited about that I'm currently working on a course 50 end games master class which we'll teach you about Rook end games minor piece end games pawn and games Queen n games Rook D2 Rook C5 and the game ends as Wei tries to fight back and a beautiful little tactical sequence sometimes end games are decided by C3 C2 sometimes they're decided by very flashy tactics C takes B3 if you take the pawn I take your Rook so obviously you do this because if this you just come back no if C takes B3 Rook C5 first check PA Queen C takes B3 way you resigned fat assay have played this game at a 98 accuracy that's crazy you can't ask for much more I mean you really can't ask you can't ask for much more and he didn't do too much look at what federal save did he just played solidly he waited for his opponent to attack and his opponent overextended and immediately got punished for it swiftly feta say of MVP of the entire protest League we'll take it we will take it five thousand bucks for that prize but you know who the anchor of the team is you know who you Trot out onto the court onto the football pitch on into the hockey arena we have the McDavid all right we have the Holland we have the the LeBron James on the team Hikaru it must feel really good to look at your lineup and to see Hikaru because this man is a defensive genius he he almost never loses literally and sometimes when he wins against some of the best players in the world he makes it look effortless he had a game his first round against harika dronavali she is the board for the last player on a team is a grand master that team is stacked MGD won their board four is like a top 10 female player in the world she's a grand master Hikaru plays an ayokin's defense and offbeat opening and plays you know they play a little bit of a sideline white you know takes this big Center but what is white not playing on the light Square so Hikaru plays H5 and his idea is to play Bishop out and Knight C6 and E6 and life is good his opponent doesn't stick to natural development doesn't play Bishop D3 doesn't play Bishop B2 instead tries to instigate with him a little bit with the move Knight H4 tries to say I don't think your Bishop is very comfortable because for example E6 here is possible but then this you know white gets two Bishops what does Hikaru do is Bishop G4 his opponent goes here and now look at this sneaky little move E6 now so that the Knight is hit hi and now white probably has to bring the Knight back Hikaru immediately changes plans normally you want to put the Knight there Here Comes C5 Hikaru is playing an advanced French with a bishop out it's like an OPI Karo Khan the French defense features the following Pawn structure but look at who you sacrificed to get there the bishop the advanced Karo Khan with C5 features this what do you sacrifice to get there a pawn and two Tempe because you move this Pawn twice Hikaru has it all this man has the position he wants and the bishop is out and his opponent is a grand master he's better than every single person watching this video right now unless Hikaru is watching this video but she is better than every one of you if y'all live four lifetimes and combine your elos you wouldn't get to her ELO no disrespect Knight C6 and look at what he chops tonight and the second the bishop takes its eye off of this Square here he comes he chops the center if his opponent plays Bishop takes D4 in this position the Knight takes the pawn the queen can't protect the bishop anymore because if the queen tries to come here the whole position falls apart you just get butchered so she goes here to try to win the pop back Hikaru doesn't let her win the pawn back he just goes he does this that Pawn's not that Pawn's just not going look at this the pawn is just hanging out in college now with parents supporting it from far away that pawn is never ever ever going to be recaptured and then it goes from bad to worse as in this position hikara plays the absolutely oh my God this is such a high level move G5 the point is you sacrifice the safety potentially of the king in the future because the king is actually safe in the center you need to pull apart the defense if you don't first of all you're threatening to trap the bishop if white plays the move G three Here Comes H4 you're knocking on the door you're gonna blast all that open so white has to do this but now loses the center Pawn and Hikaru enters the end game up a pawn and here he plays an unbelievably high level move what is the best move for black in this position the like the way to the way to answer this question is to think what does white want what does black want black might want to win this Pawn and white wants to play H4 to have any stability so Black's best move is not to move the Knight not to move the pawn not to move the bishop nothing H4 played by Hikaru in 0.9 seconds he found that move in less than one second of thought he knew it was the best move Rook G8 and now he's just up two pawns now you might ask yourself what about rookie three that does look like a good move nope gonna lose everything you're gonna lose everything and Hikaru up multiple pawns walks his King out of out of danger his opponent does do a nice job fighting back but she is down not just the pawn she is down two connected passers three pawns that are connected but these pawns are walking down the board and uh now there are three of them and unfortunately you are just not going to stop these three pawns there is absolutely nothing you can do Hikaru brings his King forward The Rook infiltrates F4 and that's it he ends the game up just two pawns but they are flying down the board and Hikaru in matches like he had a match against St Louis he made four draws but the team picked him up and every match he was incredible he got the second MVP award we had the first and second place MVPs of the entire season on our team feta say have got first place as the most valuable player in the protest League Hikaru got second losing just two games out of like 20 something you could even argue they were flukes but uh the Gotham Knights are The Undefeated champions of the protest league and I and I wanted to talk here for a few minutes about uh how we put the team together obviously we built a team around Hikaru but the pro chess league has certain things that are like if a player is over 2700 they count as a 2700. if a female player is over 23.50 they count as a 23.50 so if you have a 2500 level Grandmaster and she just so happens to be female than her rating counts as 23.50 um now you might argue well what that's that's a weird one they did that to incentivize the best players in the world to compete like Zhu and June they did that to incentivize players like that I don't know it's it's they could maybe change that in the future we have a manager on our team Alex ostrovsky a good friend of mine and he um we searched every single rating chart on fide he searched and we talked about it and we found a lunar manava our board four alua played in the world Cadet championship in 2019 in Wei Fung China I was there I was coaching a player on the American team who ended up getting the bronze alua got silver and we found her she's from Kazakhstan lives in Kazakhstan doesn't play a huge amount of tournaments but she's 2600 Blitz she's a speed chess specialist same thing with shim season volkidov Blitz and Rapid specialist same thing with Vladimir faresayev his classical rating isn't as high as some of the other players in the league but he's a 2750 rapid player he is ridiculously strong our team was put together so that our average rating was 2549.75 and the cap is 2550. we were 0.25 points under the cap best manager best Captain
