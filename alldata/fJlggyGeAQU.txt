ladies and gentlemen the game of chess has been around for thousands of years and we don't get a lot of game updates or patches on the 64 squares but what we do have is drama and we have lore and in this video I'm going to share with you a completely insane story about Magnus Carlson the best player right now and likely soon to be the greatest player of all time you will learn about how Magnus basically invented a chess opening in the most popular opening that exists on the fifth move and he played it for the first time under crazy circumstances and then I will show you all of the tricks and nuances of this opening so you can also play the Magnus Carlsen Sicilian all right uh so we're gonna go back a couple of years to 2018 Magnus is playing a tournament known as the gashimov memorial it was named after vugar gashim of a very very strong Grand Master from Azerbaijan uh who passed away do due to a brain tumor he was way too young and so they named the tournament after him and Magnus honored uh vugar by playing A variation that he played against the Sicilian Defense in the fifth round Magnus played Knight C3 D6 and D4 bringing out his Queen early but this is the insane part of the story liked to play Bishop B5 which pinned the Knight to the king and disallowed it from capturing and basically white says I'm Gonna Keep My Queen in the center of the board but in this game Magnus played Queen D2 the move Queen D2 had literally never been played before at any level of like of eliteness it had been played by 1600 a 500 it had been played by a 1000 and that Magnus has a higher rating than like almost those other people combined this was the first ever Elite game where Magnus played Queen D2 but there is where anybody played Queen D2 but there's more to it before this tournament so it goes Peter Heinen Nielsen made an annotation that's Magnus Carlson's coach longtime trainer he said that he had received an email from an international master in Greece by the name of Johannes simeonidis Greeks I hope I uh pronounce his name more or less correctly and he said hey this idea bring out the queen and bring it back it looks absurd why would you break the just generic chess rules of moving the queen two times in the opening this doesn't make any sense but there's Venom behind it and since then Magnus has played this a few times and this went from being literally never played to being played thousands of times thousands of times now back then voitashek played Knight F6 and this is the idea white is going to put the bishop here and Castle queenside so Magnus basically plays an opening for the first time ever borderline inventing it I mean the idea was suggested to him but as we all know all good inventions come from stolen ideas right or something like that uh it's not stolen obviously but he added an analysis to it and the point is that if black just plays normally this is by far the most popular setup the dragon setup at your level white gets a position like this where he just starts an attack and we will look at that later first we're gonna look at the Magnus game then if you have the patience I will show you another absolutely incredible concept so this is the point now in the game vitashek played like this and he tried to just take this very cagey setup look how Magnus just never been seen before at the highest level never Magnus plays a brand new setup imagine your voitashek one of the best players from Poland literally number two um and you're playing against the world champion and you're like what is he doing I mean no one's ever played like this against the Sicilian before right F3 and the idea is that you want to go G4 and hear why Tasha was like well if I just sit around he's gonna go like this so I'm gonna play H5 which is which is an over commitment it's a bit too much of a committal move and uh you can kind of see that the the engine doesn't really like it because now Magnus doesn't even have to play G4 he's gonna he's gonna go Knight H3 and Knight G5 so he he is Knight just sits comfortably whereas normally this Pawn would be used to kick it out now vitashek advances the pawn again looking to justify his play but at this rate his King is going to get stuck in the center and Magnus takes advantage of that with a very quick F4 the point is that you're gonna break through but also you might drop the Knight back to its home Square so vitashik plays Bishop to B7 okay uh just trying to complete his development natural stuff we have King B1 this is almost always played this move King B1 in fact if I can just uh go back to this position oftentimes black will move the queen out here and the King goes to B1 which we will look at a little bit later because not only do I want to show you this insane Magnus Carlson game that he played under these circumstances uh paying homage to uh you know an homage I don't actually know how to pronounce that word I hear everybody say homage I hear homage how do you say that word fromage anyway but paying homage to uh uh the the Grand Master who passed away too soon the very strong Grandmaster from Azerbaijan playing it in the tournament named after him just amazing stuff and in this game Magnus had a brilliant position and he could have played a very thematic uh Sicilian sacrifice which is Knight D5 this is a brutal way to obliterate the black pieces the point is that you hit everything and after it takes takes if the Knight let's say Retreats back to d8 Simply Bishop G4 and then if the Rook moves you have Queen D3 hitting the rook and you just very very very slowly completely rip apart Black's defenses it's just the king is stuck in the center plus six at a minimum and the Ruckus traps basically uh so Magnus didn't play Knight D5 uh Magnus generally likes to squeeze opponents to death if he has the option and in this game I mean he's basically doing that I mean the engine isn't blessing his play necessarily but uh his position is still very very good what's funny is that Magnus played the inaccurate move G4 two times first he played G4 and accurately here and then he played G4 and accurately here but again we're looking at the with the game with an engine kind of cheating you know this looks absolutely horrifying to deal with and now Magnus uh plays Knight E2 so he brings the Knight back and he tries to trade off some pieces here vitashek tries to trade off the Bishops so take take Magnus says no we're not going to trade the Bishops and your king is still in in basically the center so I'm gonna rely on these Pawn thrusts to open up the position it's a very tough position to play with black uh just because the engine for a move or two gave it equality you know I wouldn't I wouldn't be so sure and you know Magnus steps on the gas immediately with this move E5 black has a very unpleasant decision he can open up the position if he locks the position the bishop is permanently blocked and the guy attacking wants a close Center so now this is all shut off F5 comes in Queen G5 F6 Bishop sacrifice it it's just game over so D takes E5 is played in the game and now the position absolutely explodes F takes E5 vitashek brings The Rook down trying to trade off pieces uh unfortunately this loses the game to a very brutal and Swift execution Magnus plays takes takes and what is the diff What is the uh one similarity between this King and this bishop is that amazing how on Earth are you going to get to both of those at the same time Rook H2 you're gonna play for this and this and if this danger levels right if you take my Bishop I'm gonna take your queen but what's worth more than a bishop and a queen combined you you're worth more than a bishop and a queen combined but also the king check forces the king out and boom Queen A7 and vitashek resigned because he's gonna have to move his King and then Rook takes H1 uh will simply result in a full winning of a bishop and the King has a getaway Square so there is never background Checkmate you know the king is always going to be able to go to B2 then this is a completely winning position for white because he's simply up a bishop and then he will win the other pawns and promote you can give checks but the king is always going to be safe I promise so a very successful experiment with Queen takes D4 and then Queen back to D2 but vitashek played in a slightly different way like I think vitashek played in a way like you know E6 A6 H5 this isn't really seen anymore I mean he was reacting to something for the first time and therefore he played maybe in not necessarily the most uh Accurate Way um but still you know Magnus kind of made an inaccuracy a little bit later but it seemed like he was always in control of the game um but uh yeah this is sort of the idea now I told you uh in the intro that I would show you another concept right and I you shouldn't leave just yet because you can actually add this to your repertoire in fact I will be making a course quite soon it's not out right now but if it is out you should check the description it'll be in the first line because I'm recording this January 31st I think the course will be out in March or April I am going to record a course on this opening for why and other openings it'll be based around E4 um now I want to show you how to play this the way it's supposed to be played the way it's played at your level so this is very applicable to you don't go anywhere just yet uh this was a game played in 2022 uh between Grandmaster very strong Grand Master uh baghdan Daniel dayak from Romania uh and uh an international master anastasios pavlidis and it was the same opening Knight C6 back and this time look how black played Black played in a very traditional Dragon setup the reason why white plays D4 against D6 is because the bishop will not go this way you see this opening makes a little bit less sense to play Let's you know let's say uh against this because the bishop but it's it's actually still playable but the bishop will come out this way so you only help the other guy right and even then it's playable but against D6 you know you're gonna force your opponent into a dragon setup and folks watch how quickly the black position gets obliterated okay in many of these positions black wants to attack with these pawns with this bishop and with this queen White's attack is like dynamite it's like dynamite all right and Magnus brought this to the world well I mean you could argue that Johannes simeonidis brought us to the world but with a name like Magnus attached to it you know it's like it's like when you go on Shark Tank all right you pitch an idea to an investor that's basically what simeonidas did and now I'm mentioning his name here right so Bishop E6 was played in this game now 92 and now what we are going to be seeing is this and bringing the king to B1 all right now in this game black played Rook C8 so as you see Bishop E6 Rook C8 Queen A5 King B1 played A6 and now it's Off to the Races the center is deadlocked you cannot break through in the center because white setup is so intelligent it completely controls where black wants to break in the center and the other amazing thing is White's Knight is so strong so everything in White's position is completely Rock Solid which gives him the time to go G4 and then Knight F4 and he's combining this attack with the capture of the bishop maybe just going to an end game or maybe jumping to the D5 square but the king is always completely safe so black plays Knight E5 and Bug done just plays Bishop B2 just slowly improving all right black brings the Knight back now jumps in the Knight to D5 I told you he's taking advantage of all of the benefits of his position take take sends the and now uh-oh uh oh oh uh oh H5 is on the way H5 is on the way you can kick mine you you can try to kick my night out with E6 but I'm coming back and this is still on the way black plays F6 and this is the beginning of the end as Knight F4 jumps into the light squares black plays Knight C5 check here and the attack just keeps going I mean folks the absolute demolition of the black position here cannot be understated G5 and now H6 the bulldozing continues he takes takes on G7 Queen H5 threatens made in one Bishop C4 activating look at this Demolition and the pawn will be the deciding factor as the position completely falls apart Pawn takes F6 Pawn takes C7 check and baghdan trades Bishop for Knight gives a check and black just resigns he resigns because the King has to go somewhere and anywhere it goes the bishop will be capturing The Rook on the next move and when the bishop is done capturing The Rook the queen will take the Knight and it's over you lose a rook you're also down about 400 rating points nearly and you are also getting mated so uh yeah this is basically a dream scenario in this variation and just one more game uh this one was even more brutal than the last this is a game uh between uh Josh Castillo Joshua Ruiz Castillo he's a grand master from Colombia and he was playing in a just just a random tournament his opponent is is a 2000. now yes this is a lopsided uh matchup but 2000 is higher than 99 of you so this game is still applicable to you because a 2000 opponent would beat most of you is just the statistics but watch how this game goes down all right and at the end I will show you kind of the current meta so this is the most popular setup look what happens if black tries to fight back I'm only gonna take about 30 seconds of your time Knight to D5 if you take the Knight I take first I'm gonna do this then I'm gonna take then I'm gonna bust open your king I mean Black's position falls apart in the game black tried to do this he took on G4 and Castillo just played H5 with no care in the world then he took on G7 then he played Queen H6 and then he just got rid of the Knight the game was over in 15 moves boom check and black resigned actually I think black played latter I think black did not I think black allowed this ladder Checkmate in 19 moves are you kidding me against the 2000 yeah I'm telling you folks this system that Magnus brought to the Forefront of top chess is ridiculous this queen D2 Sicilian Queen D4 Queen D2 is wild stuff nowadays the top players are playing G6 B3 and Bishop H6 some super wild lines white goes F4 and black plays F5 it's like super super complicated and there's this very interesting variation here where white actually sacrifices the E4 Pawn just completely gives it away and the point is to get a position with like H3 and Knight on E2 and G4 and start this kind of monster attack anyway at the cost of a pawn so super interesting stuff is happening in this queen D2 Battleground um and black has many ways of playing it now of course if black plays Knight C6 on the second move you can't do this but there is some tricks here too there are some tricks here too I should say first of all you can play Knight F3 and if your opponent plays the night ORF they are completely out of prep meaning if you're if your opponent plays this and tries to play a night or Sicilian which is this by making them play Knight C6 you have already taken them out of prep if they play another Sicilian without Knight C6 you just took them out of their prep like they don't play this so Knight F3 and they have to either play E5 or play something that they've never seen before okay so it's a very tricky move order and not to mention you have Bishop B5 which is also a very tricky line I I really enjoy these positions for white but the point is that when they do play this D6 and a lot of people do millions of people it's the second most popular move and it's close to Knight C6 D4 take take and this is the story of how Magnus just played an opening that had never been seen at the highest level of Chess he beat a very strong opponent made it look relatively easy and since then thousands of games have been played here this is the amazing thing about being a guy like Magnus uh is that you can play an opening like this and then people take it to the next level you have your own analysis some you got from simeonidas some you made yourself and some people made after you like discovering this whole system of G6 Bishop H6 F5 the super imbalanced stuff amazing stuff and if you look at the database there's barely any games played so this is the story of how Magnus played an opening for the first time dedicated to a man who passed away far too soon at a tournament named after that same man vulgar gashimov gashimov used to play Bishop B5 and a lot of azeri players used to play Bishop B5 and Magnus took an opportunity to literally play an opening for the first time ever at the highest stage the biggest stage dedicated to the man who used to play in a very very similar way amazing just a crazy story right and now to this day Queen D2 is played I mean it's probably been played 50 times in Blitz Games while I was recording this video so there you go this is your calling to go try the Magnus Carlson Sicilian and if you're lucky enough to watch this video in you know April May 2022 2023 2023 then um maybe at my uh my E4 course is already out on it there you go folks hope you enjoyed the video now get out of here
