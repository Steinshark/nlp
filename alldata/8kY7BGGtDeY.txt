hello everyone and welcome in this video we are talking about one of the most efficient cars ever created this is the Mercedes EQ xx and it is the most efficient car Mercedes has ever created now what's really cool about this vehicle is it gives us a starting point to basically determine what is the theoretical limit on efficiency and energy consumption for cars now let's say you want to create a vehicle that can travel a thousand kilometers for about 600 miles well it's very easy to do if it's a gasoline car you simply give it a large fuel tank if it's an electric car you simply give it a giant battery technically it is very possible but what if you want to do that as efficiently as possible so if you look at today's cars a 100 kilowatt hour battery pack is good for about 300 miles or about 500 kilometers so Mercedes set out to double this in other words take that same 100 kilowatt hour battery pack but instead of try traveling 500 kilometers travel a thousand kilometers okay so if we're to translate Mercedes goal into an energy consumption number what they are targeting is 10 kilowatt hours per 100 kilometers driven and so if you're from the US and you're like what the heck does that mean basically what they're talking about is about 209 miles per gallon equivalent miles per gallon is a terrible unit so we're going to try to avoid using it in this video but we're going to be looking at five different aspects of the card that help create this consumption number and what those specific numbers are for Mercedes in each of these five categories all right so to set the mood we're going to start off with this beautiful plot right here and what we're focusing on is this purple line so what does this purple line show us well it shows us at any given constant vehicle speed while traveling on flat ground what is our Mercedes EQ XX energy consumption in kilowatt hours per 100 kilometers for example if we are traveling 10 kilometers per hour we can see that our energy consumption is about five kilowatt hours per 100 kilometers so you might wonder okay well why does this have the shape that it has so if you think about if you're sitting at a stop light you've got your screen on maybe you've got a fan on you've got music on you're consuming energy but you're not moving so your relative energy consumption is very high it's basically infinite if you're not moving and then that as you start to move the importance of that screen being on is very little if you're traveling at a high speed but as you get to higher speeds then you start to run into aerodynamic drag as a problem so it gives you this shape here where your floor is made up of rolling resistance it's not a perfect line but for the purposes of this video that's fine so for this Mercedes EQ XX what they're doing is trying to optimize a car for efficiency within this range right here at higher speeds they want a high speed efficient vehicle in other words they want it to be efficient on the highway now that doesn't mean that if it were to drive slower it wouldn't get better efficiency it would it would get better fuel economy better energy consumption if they were to drive slower but they're optimizing it for driving on the highway so we'll talk about what that means a bit later but know that this is what it's optimized for if you were to design a vehicle that was always going to be driving at a lower speed you would do things differently but we live in the real world we want to drive in the real world at real world speeds so that's what they're designing it for so for the speeds that Mercedes is targeting aerodynamics makes up 62 percent of the overall energy consumed so if you look at the equation for aerodynamic drag well you can look at what are the variables that I can mess around with in order to improve aerodynamics and there's only two that you really can control from a design standpoint your drag coefficient and the frontal area so as far as the drag coefficient basically what you're doing is you know a human has to sit in that car right so you take a five to ninety five percent human you put them within a space and then you try and design a car around that space so that the human can fit and you have a really aerodynamic shape around them that also looks like a car part of the requirement is it needs to look like a car so if you look at cars like the Mercedes eqs which is a production car and when it came out it was the most aerodynamic vehicle from a drag coefficient standpoint lowest drag coefficient of just 0.20 that's exceptionally good I mean we're getting towards the bottom of what is possible with production cars a penguin has a drag coefficient of just 0.05 you know so we could be driving Penguins maybe we should be driving Penguins but we're not we're driving cars and so this number this drag coefficient for the eqxx is 0.17 which is better than the best production car um there's some there's some disclaimers that go along with this first of all there's a diffuser that retracts out from the back of the vehicle that gives you a point so that takes you down from 0.18 down to 0.17 also this 0.17 is with the cooling shutters closed so there's some Outlets some exhaust vents on the hood of the car uh if this is actually opened and you're allowing air flow through the front of the car with the shutters then that's giving you an additional .007 to your drag coefficient so with both of those that's putting you closer to 0.19 Mercedes says that if you get to a drag coefficient of around 0.16 well then it stops looking like a car one example is you know Mercedes said they could have gotten down to 0.16 but they would have had to cover the rear wheels and they didn't want to cover the rear wheels because it's ugly I mean a lot of us agree so it is possible that you can get below a number like 0.2 but it starts to look less and less like a car and honestly if you look at the eqs you know at point two it's like does that thing look like a car I guess kind of but the point is you get towards a limit right and Mercedes says that limits 0.16 unless you start covering the wheels and realistically you know that's with some things happening there that are kind of hard to achieve with a production car so we're towards the limit when it comes to drag coefficient okay so the next aerodynamic variable we can play with is the frontal area and what I like about this is that they kept it realistic so the eqxx has a frontal area of 2.12 meters squared you can compare that to Vehicles like the Prius or Tesla Model 3 which have frontal areas of about 2.2 meters squared so while this is on the low end of like a midsize sedan it's basically the smallest practical size there are Vehicles out there with smaller frontal areas for example the old Honda inside or smart car but there's a reason why all of us aren't driving smart cars right there's a practical element to having a larger sedan so they're trying to keep it within the realm of practicality and we have this frontal area of 2.12 meters squared all right so if we move on to weight Mercedes says this makes up about 20 percent of the overall energy consumption and so once again if we go to our equation for you know how much energy is being lost from weight and what variables can we control well we can control the mass of the vehicle and the tires we select so the mass of this vehicle is 1 755 kilograms which isn't all that light of a vehicle but compared to Mercedes electric or the eqs that's coming in at about 2500 kilograms so it is significantly lighter now as you know the battery makes up a significant percentage of the overall weight of an electric car so it is very interesting to analyze the battery in this vehicle so here I've got an example of a production Mercedes the eqs here we have an example of a competitor you know a Tesla Model S with 100 kilowatt hour battery pack and then we have our prototype eqxx so here we have the battery size in kilowatt hours here we have the battery weight in kilogram here we have the battery volume in liters and then we can look at so we can compare them directly the energy densities by mass and by volume so the eqs has an energy density of 150 watt hours per kilogram versus the Tesla Model S production car which is at 186 Watt hours per kilogram the eqs production Mercedes at 215 Watt hours per liter with the model S at 250 watt hours per liter now the eqxx with its prototype battery achieving an even better 202 so still fairly close but better than the model S one hours per kilogram but a very impressive volumetric energy density of 400 watt hours per liter all right so how do you achieve such an impressive volumetric energy density well one of the major factors is that this battery has passive cooling so it doesn't have cooling channels liquid cooling channels passing through the battery now that immediately raises some concerns right this is just a big box of cells so you can get a lot of you know energy density into a relatively small space however we need to think about heat heat is the enemy of batteries also cold temperatures right if this thing were to be starting in super cold temperatures you'd probably want like some sort of resistive heater within the battery in order to heat up those cells before you get going but heat is what we're really talking about here so if you have a lot of heat being generated within this battery pack well you need to be able to get rid of that heat the thing is we're talking about a super efficient powertrain so we're not generating that much heat so we really don't have to think about it as much from an active cooling standpoint however you still have to charge the battery pack right and charging is going to put a lot of heat into that battery pretty much no matter what so you can limit the charge rate in order to reduce how much heat you get building up in that pack well it's still at a charge rate limit of 120 kilowatts which is actually pretty good now you might say you know that's kind of trash compared to the Hummer EV which can be charged at 350 kilowatts well yes this is about three times the number right but actually because this vehicle is so inefficient if you're to look at if you charge for just 10 minutes how far can you travel with either charge rate for the Hummer that turns out to be about 130 kilometers for the Mercedes that's 200 kilometers so even though the charge rate is a third because it's so much more efficient you can actually go further with however much amount of time you spend add a charger now I don't know how feasible passive Cooling in a production car actually is because we have some examples of electric cars with passive Cooling and the batteries tend to have pretty poor longevity they don't last that long and so one of the things that is acting in Mercedes Advantage here is that while they may not have active cooling for their system and heat does kill batteries they are operating under fewer charge cycles because of their efficiency so if you think about a car that travels 300 miles and that takes a full battery charge to do it because it has a 100 kilowatt hour battery pack well that's only half the battery in this Mercedes so to travel the same distance let's say 200 000 miles it's going to take half the amount of total charges in order to travel that distance so while it is at a disadvantage from a cooling standpoint it doesn't have active cooling it's probably going to operate under far fewer charge cycles over its lifetime than a diff different product and so because of that perhaps the longevity issue is not as big of a concern all right so getting back to Rolling resistance we have our vehicles weight and then we have the coefficient of rolling resistance of the tires so our tire selection is critically important these are specially designed tires for this vehicle and they have a coefficient of rolling resistance Mercedes was only willing to tell me that it was less than .005 I don't know what the actual number is but I know that it's less than that number they have a Max load rating of 50 psi for the inflation pressure and so they told me that they were getting close to this number for inflation so again we're getting close to theoretical limit of like coefficient of rolling resistance how much rolling resistance we're going to have because it's unrealistic for a vehicle at this weight to get into pressures that are much higher than that and numbers that are much lower than this so you know it could be a 0.004 but point is these are extremely efficient tires so they have done their homework as far as getting a very efficient Tire on this vehicle alright so our final category Mercedes says everything else makes up for 18 of the energy consumption so this is including things like our powertrain efficiency our electric systems HVAC I believe it includes acceleration deceleration because 18 is still a pretty significant amount uh interesting thing about this vehicle it is rear wheel drive and you might think okay if I'm designing an electric car for maximum efficiency I might want to choose front wheel drive because as I'm decelerating and you have that weight shift forward the maximum rate the amount of energy that you can pull from that front axle will be greater than the rear axle so long as you're reaching really high deceleration rates right as long as you keep it within normal rates you know 0.2 G of decelerating well you can do that with the rear axle you don't have so much load transfer going to the front that's an impossible number to reach so that's kind of one of those design choices here another one of those design choices there actually took a two-speed transmission from a future electric Mercedes and they removed the first gear so the first gear mostly used for accelerating they basically just kept the highway gear and optimized that single gear for that driving speed that they believe it's going to spend most of its time at so choosing the gearing and just that one gear rather than having more moving Parts more weight because they have the luxury of Designing something just for efficiency for one specific scenario now a super impressive number relating to this EQ XX is the powertrain efficiency of 95 and this is not a peak this is not this single point where okay let's pick the absolute best scenario best point and we can achieve 95 percent this is over their internal long distance driving cycle basically like a highway driving cycle they can achieve 95 Powertrain efficiency and so to kind of illustrate how crazy this is and there are other cars out there that can do this uh this has been achieved in Formula E for example but those are race cars this is trying to be a road car but if you look at for example a battery that can discharge with an efficiency of 99.5 an inverter you know that energy goes from the battery to the inverter let's say the inverter has a 98 efficiency then goes through a motor which has a 98 efficiency than through a transmission which has a 99.5 percent efficiency again in this case it's just one gear but you're going to have losses through that gear regardless you have losses through everything if you multiply all these together you get 95 percent efficiency these are not numbers from Mercedes the only thing Mercedes was willing to tell me is that the inverter and the motor make up the majority of the losses so I just made up these as an example of how you could get to 95 percent but what this really illustrates is how close this is to the Limit because you know think about how much does it take to improve this just a little bit and is it worth that financially right like these are really good numbers and if it takes a lot of money to increase that 99.5 to 99.6 it's like was that worth doing so again we're getting towards the theoretical limit on efficiency when we're talking about powertrains uh in the realm of 95 percent now before we get into the juicy finale on theoretical limits I think it's cool to look at existing technology in comparison to what Mercedes is seeking to achieve so they set out to achieve 10 kilowatt hours per 100 kilometers according to the EPA the best efficiency we've ever seen in a production car sold in the United States is the Tesla Model 3 standard range plus which achieved about 15 kilowatt hours per 100 kilometers so we still have a significant jump between that and this Mercedes or about 142 mile per gallon equivalent now if you look at combustion engines without the assist of a large battery pack so I'm excluding plug-ins here and only looking at hybrids or other gasoline diesel powered vehicles that have the ultimate fuel source is you know either diesel or gasoline and it is powering a combustion engine the best example sold in the United States with the highest combined rating is the Hyundai ioniq hybrid which had a combined rating of 59 miles per gallon or about 35 kilowatt hours per 100 kilometer so you can see how much of a gap there is this is actually drawn to scale in kilowatt hours per kilometer how much of a gap there is between combustion engines and electric cars it is massive now that is not to say that they're not bad electric cars out there the Hummer EV is off the charts it's up here and that is because it has an incredibly large energy consumption it is more efficient than a Hyundai ioniq but it's massive it's not aerodynamically efficient shall we say and so because of that its energy consumption is very high so the ionic is really impressive for what it is for gasoline-powered vehicle it is extremely impressive but overall we're Limited at an efficiency with these combustion engines of about 35 and you might say Jason there are combustion engines out there with greater than 35 percent efficiency yeah some of them have achieved 50 but what manufacturers love to do is give you one number at one condition at one RPM one load that it can achieve that 50 and then you ignore the rest in the real world combustion engines especially the ones in cars we like to drive they vary in RPM and they vary and load and so yeah you can have things like cvts you can have a series hybrid you can do things like that to optimize that combustion engine But ultimately there will be variants in the loading and because of that there will be inefficiencies so there is a cap you know somewhere around this 60 mile per gallon plus where combustion engines just aren't going to go beyond that without the help of something like an electric powertrain so was Mercedes able to achieve their goal of driving a thousand kilometers yes they did it twice so they did two drives in Europe both times they were easily able to achieve you know that 10 kilowatt hour per 100 kilometer in fact they beat it quite significantly the first one being at 8.7 kilowatt hours per hundred kilometers easily hitting a thousand kilometers on their drive and then the second one at 8.3 kilowatt hours per 100 km owners they hit 1200 kilometers on that drive so I'll show the speeds and distances that they went on the screen but ultimately what's really interesting about this to me is that when we start to look at all of these factors you know we've maxed out our aerodynamics from both the frontal area of a practical vehicle and something that looks like a car not a penguin we've you know we've done really well with our tires we've done extremely well with our powertrain perhaps we could pull out some weight but again understand that this is just 20 percent of overall energy so even if we were to cut that weight in half which would be extremely hard to do well then you're only saving 10 total energy you know so even if you go to a hundred percent efficiency with your powertrain right it doesn't get you all that much so if you start to look at these numbers here it kind of tells you that a real world realistic efficiency cap the theoretical limit that we're not going to go beyond is about eight kilowatt hours per 100 kilometers or the equivalent of those of you in America of about 260 miles per gallon and you can see you know compared to the technology we have today in production cars we're at 142. so yes we have room for improvement but it's not going to go to some insane level you know there's that 15 versus the same maybe we can get you know half of that uh but but that's really a stretch in order to get there I mean you can see some of the compromises that have to be made but but things can be done to get to a better Point than where we are and ultimately there is a limit of where we can go thank you all so much for watching if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below
