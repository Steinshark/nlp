- What's up, Logangsters? Today, we're gonna be eating the most expensive and bizarre foods, like a golden steak. - 24K Tomahawk. - Octopus. - Look how hard it is. - Kangaroo. - It tastes like Kangaroo Jack. - Cockroach. - Goose liver. - Smell it before you eat it. - Ghost pepper. - It's making my nose run. - Shrimp. - It's got googly eyes. - Are you still chewing? - It only gets severely worse from here. - Oh God. - And Kobe beef. Speaking at Kobe beef, we're
outside the restaurant, let's go eat it. - Whooh! - I am Logan Paul. We are about to eat Kobe beef. I can't wait to see how this tastes. This first steak is called Kobe beef and we wanted to experience it because it cost $1,000, and we wanted to see if
it was worth the price. Dude, this just smells good. This right here is $1,000. - Yes. - This is like $30? - Close to. It depends on how you do the math. Oh, actually it was $40. - No. It tastes like butter. - Whoa, let Chandler do his first. - All right. - Boy, oh my goodness. - I know, right? - Easy, easy. - Yeah, I don't know. - Hold on, hold on, hold on. - Boy, that is so good. - Wow, that was insane. I can't wait to eat the rest. - Oh my God. - All right, bros, I'm PewDiePie. We just ate Kobe beef and spent a grand. - Beautiful. - Kobe. - And we're gonna go to the next place. Let's go. So, we're waiting on our next reservation and we're gonna play a quick game. This is a grasshopper. Chris, I'll give you $100 if you eat it. - $100? - The crunch. - That's pretty good. Can I have some bottle of water? - Garrett, I'll give you $100, if you eat a grasshopper. - No. - Chandler? - That's not a grasshopper. - Okay? - Eew, it's just like crunchy. - Crickets, grasshoppers. $1,000, would you eat 'em? - You guys want an
opportunity before I do this? - No. - Chandler, for $1,000. - Shoot. - Chandler, what could
you buy with the grand? - Don't do it, man. Are you doing it? - Just don't think about it. In one minute, you'll be $1,000 richer and you'll be glad you did it. - You think I'll do it? I wanna hear no as an answer. - No. - Oh my God.

liver with a century egg. It's gonna be pretty gross. - Oh God. - Dude, if he said it's gross, you know it's gonna be gross. - Gentlemen. - Goose liver, I don't care. Let's try it. - You just ate that whole thing, man. - Is it bad? - It's really good. - Okay. - You're eating a goose liver. - Im' trying so hard right now. - Eat it. - Don't you love the liver. - You don't like liver, man? - God, that was so good. I'm glad I ate it all and
didn't spit it in my name. - That was so nasty. - We gotta do the egg now. - Oh no. - Century egg. - Smell it before you eat it. - Put it in the napkin. - No. - Dude, I could smell it in your brain. - No, Chandler, you eat that
whole thing you get $500. Whole thing. - Yeah, right, I just throw up. - Come on. Swallow it. - $500. - I don't know if I want to do this. - Chris, Chris, Chris. - Yeah. Oh, yeah. - It's like if somebody hopped
a loogie into your mouth. - That is the perfect
example of what it is. I wanna remind you guys

Let me think about this. - 10 seconds. There you go. - They're like poking out your mouth. Look at that. - Yeah. - Chandler, $2,000 If you take a bite of this octopus. - Dude, I took this. - Chandler, two grand. All you have to do is
take a big bite to that and swallow it. - Oh God. - I don't see you doing that. Dude, can you even eat this? - Chandler, Chandler, Chandler. - This is a challenge you gonna win. - Chandler, Chandler, Chandler. - Yehey! - Did he serve it to you raw? - Probably fried.

eating kangaroo, camel, fish, shrimp, octopus, all this stuff. The guys were over there just throwing up. Now we're gonna go to New York which is a little ways
away and eat golden steak. So, let's go do that. - Chandler, why do you
always lose challenges? - Ooh. - Yeah, dude. This is the most expensive
restaurant we could find. If I don't spend $10,000,
all of you can punch me. - Yeah. - Cause we will spend $10,000. What's that name? - Nurserer.
- Nursery. - Exactly, none of us
knew how to pronounce it, which means it's good. Let's go. I want to spend $10,000 on
a meal for me in the squad. And this place is perfect
because they're known for putting gold on food
and other crazy things. - You're welcome to Nusr-Et Steakhouse. - My name is Saadin. I'll be taking care of you today. Do you have any questions
about the menu so far? No, it all looks good. Can we just get one of everything? - Are you sure about that? - Yup, why not? - Good evening, gentlemen. Welcome. This is our meat sushi. This is cooked rice. You're gonna put the
ginger pickle on the top, dip it on the soy sauce. Enjoy. - I think this restaurant's
too fancy for me. I don't know how to eat here. - I don't belong here. - He said pickled. - I think we've been cooking food wrong our whole life. Yeah, you're supposed to cook food with flame throwers. - I was like right at the camera. - You grab it by the finger and do one shot, don't use fork. - No fork, Chandler, no fork. - No fork. - Okay, so just one
shot right in the mouth. - Right. - Hmmn. - This is the best grape
juice you guys have, right? - Absolutely. - Chris loves grape juice. - This I love, I'm a big grape juice fan. - So how was your premium grape juice? - It's very good. It's very it's way
better than Welch juice. - Is this better than the grape
juice they serve in church? - Good evening, gentlemen. This is our Wagyu beef carpaccio. - It looks like a pizza. - Wow. - Oh man, he's getting fancy. - That was like an intestine though. - Slightly. some olive oil, Some aged balsamic. - That, that looks good. - Yeah, signature. - No spoon.

out to a fancy restaurant. Do you not like it? - My turn, my turn. - I'm just gonna go over here real quick. It's not for me. - Your turn. - I mean, it's, it's... - I like it. Think anybody's ever
dabbed in this restaurant? - I was the first, I was the first. Play that in slow mo. - I think I figured out the
expensiveness of this place, it's the plate washing. Every time they bring you something, they bringing new plate. Dude, they're going
through so many plates. - They're washing-
- They're washing so many. Yeah, that backroom? t's just plates. - Thank you so much. - This is our lokum sliced-beef fillet, it's a tenderloin cuts. This is one of my favorite dishes. - Oh my goodness. This one we made it to it. - Oh man. - Heart with love. - Oh, that's with love - Mine wasn't made with love. - Yours wasn't made with love. I'm the only one who gets love. Can I get a smiley face on mine. - Smiley face, why not? - Yes. - Look at that. - There it is. - Who's going first? - Me.

It has onions, and shelves inside, and our special secret sauce inside. Delicious. Gentlemen. - Oh God. - Oh man. That was a delicate placement. - You always get more
delicate placements to me. - Oh, that was pretty delicate. Oh, look at that, that was delicate. - I want to go first. - All right. - Why does everything here tastes like chicken butter? - Chicken butter? - This is gonna sound weird but if you mix the taste
of spaghetti with steak, that's what that tastes like. - Well, like really soft spaghetti. - Yeah, really soft. It has like a spaghetti taste to it. Does it not? Does it not have a spaghetti taste to it? - Yeah. - Dude, it tastes like
spaghetti, but it's awesome. - Wait, smell it. - You know, it tastes like a mushroom. It smells like tacos. - It do, oh my God. It smells like tacos so much. It smells so good. - I don't want to eat it.
- Why? - 'Cause then they won't have anymore. - Jimmy, if you gonna take
a small pinch of salt, you will not regret it. That's the best salt you've
ever had in your life. Put it in your mouth. That's a good salt. - It is. - That's so good. It's like eating candy. - You all good? - Guys, told Chandler
to put his phone away. We're at an expensive restaurant. - Here we go. - Oh, that's how saltbae does. - It's another Wagyu sirloin steak. So we're gonna wrap it with 24K gold. - The first thing is ready. - All right, let's go. Ladies and gentlemen, 24K gold steak. wrapped with eatable gold. - Nice. - You wrap it in gold.

anything like this. - That's gonna be 595. - I probably get up there. - There we are. - Does this make me a
unicorn if I eat gold? - [Server[ Ladies and
gentlemen, 24K Tomahawk. - How much is it? - The big boy, this is thousand dollars. You are the second person actually ever eat the steak right now. The first one I did it, the boxer Canelo, after he won his fight like two, three days ago in New York - I feel conceited, having the time. - The best part, there it is. - How bad would it be if
I dipped it in ketchup? - If Salt Bae was he's not gonna like it. - As you see lots of gold. Oh my God. That is amazing.
- That is amazing. - That is so good. - It's delicious. - Corn on the cob. - So cool. - Corn on the cob. - This is our initiation into the squad. - We got a corn on the
cob, a piece of gold. - Oh my God. - Now I have gold on my fingers - Dude, my fingers are covered in gold. - Look at that gold. - The two tables together,
we've hit eight grand but we've run out of things to buy. - That's so annoying. - I want to spend 10 grand. - So, we're thinking about
buying two people in this place a Tomahawk golden steak. - Let's do it. - Let's do it. - Generally, we can just order a Tomahawk for random table. - So they wanna buy you $1,000 gold steak. - Oh my God. - Oh, thank you. - It's a gift from them. - Oh no. - For daddy. - The best steak ever. - There we go, the bill is ten grand. - So, we have the card
to pay for the 10 grand. For the tip, we're
gonna do one, two three, and 14, 15, 20, 21, 22, 40, 50, $5,000 for the tip. Here we go, here's the tip. Thank you so much, gentlemen. Remember that video
where the last to leave the circle got 10 grand, or that other video where the last to take their hand off the
Lamborghini gotta keep it, or the recent one, last take
hand off house gets to keep it? Well, we're doing another
one of those in February except for this time
we're only inviting people that buy merch. We're gonna pick four random people that buy either shirt or hoodie during the month of January. We're gonna email them, fly them out and let 'em compete in one of those challenges
for a big prize. This might be one of your only chances to ever be in one of my videos. So if it interests you, make sure you buy merch
before the end of January. And like I said, we'll
pick four random people and fly them out. If you subscribe, I'll
show you Chandler's tattoo. - Well, that's a good prize. - Chandler, they subscribed, show it. Where is it?
- Where? - Show it. They subscribed. - Should I really?
- Yeah, do it. - Oh, wrong arm.
