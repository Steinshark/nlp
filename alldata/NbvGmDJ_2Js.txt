today i was accused of being an internet sicko a guy that would do anything for views my accuser lana rhodes she fired back at me today saying you shouldn't worry about the nft scam don't you know there's a war going on saying people who are concerned about her scamming investors are being stupid because quote people are living in fear for their life in ukraine right now and people are worried about nfts what does this world come to and i know what you're thinking yeah what has this world come to where a girl can't get a free pass on a scam dude you hear what putin's doing i mean look i'm just gonna respond to this real quick i don't feel like it needs it but um we know we know a lot of two bad things can happen at the same time just just because we're talking about you doesn't mean we forgot about the tragedy in ukraine just because we point out one bad thing doesn't devalue the other thing we're all adults here right in fact i dare i say it we might be able to hold a third one hold on one second let me try to create it without losing all knowledge of ukraine maybe using war as a cover for your scandals is bad maybe that i don't know did you guys all forget about ukraine for a second honestly i did real quick um but this rubbed me the wrong way guys in part because of a situation going on here at coffeezilla hq many of you guys don't know about but those ogs do which is that all of this all of coffeezilla really is designed created by a ukrainian even i am the creation of a ukrainian his name is ed we've had him on the channel before aka young pixar as we like to call him as of yesterday he's stuck in ukraine he literally can't leave his country's being invaded but ukraine won't let young men leave because of like rules about men under 60 leaving the country it's very confusing and i've been calling everyone trying to use every ounce of influence i have to get this guy out i barely slept and then this chick lana rhodes comes and goes hey stop being mad at me guys you hear of ukraine don't you know people are suffering yeah i think i think we caught that lana thanks though you know here's a take that might get me in trouble um just cause putin exists doesn't mean you're a good person right just because there's someone worse than you and doesn't make you better right maybe if your argument for why you're a good person is that you haven't invaded anyone yet maybe that's not a good call uh anyway i got ed's permission to talk about this um publicly and i just wanted to say before you you know go to the next part of this segment if you're in la viv or have suede to get people out of ukraine please contact me on twitter or by email it's all i wanted to say but now with that out of the way i also want to address some other stuff that was said about us me specifically which is that i was accused of being an effing sicko a disease of the internet who will do anything and say anything for views now i'm going to be honest here i didn't have it on my bingo card that lana rhodes would accuse me of being the one to do anything for reviews but here we are i guess i'm just wild like that just just crazy i'll say anything things like my number one goal for this project is to increase the value of cryptosys nfts and make it a lucrative investment for holders i mean i'll say it oh wait that wasn't me who said that that that was lana rhodes she's the one who abandoned the project and took the money i mean look honestly guys all i want is the same thing i've wanted all along which is for her to return the money to investors i guess that makes me some kind of a freak some kind of a disease of the internet wanting people's money returned to them look guys she can't do that right right how can this millionaire possibly live on millions of dollars minus like a million dollars how can she live if her net worth goes down like a percent i mean what do you want her to starve what does this world come to where lana rhodes is being ridiculed while putin is invading ukraine now i will say one positive thing that has come of my coverage right lana has once again taken an interest in her nft out of nowhere posting for the first time since she disappeared she said it's on the holders if they're gonna make their money back quote i'm not saying i can turn this investment around for anyone or make anyone profit that is up to you guys at this point now i do find this funny that she's basically like look i'm back but it's all on you i hold no responsibility here for what happens to your investment even though it was all my idea actually look i'm even saying a partial refund at this point i'm bargaining dude i'm way past full refund i'm just saying look she denies she made 1.5 million dollars instead lana rhodes says she got a cut of that but if that's the case fine give that money back right give that money back to investors like where's the talk of that i wonder if they're like in a room discussing this scandal lana rhodes has going on and they're talking about like how to handle it and you know someone's in the back like hey maybe we should uh refund them another guy's like hey maybe we should like deliver on what we promised everyone and lana rhodes is like no wait i've got it we'll blame it on ukraine
