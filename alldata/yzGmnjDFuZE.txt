my favorite streamer ninja is currently doing a charity livestream for suicide prevention I really like ninja and I watch them just about every day and one thing I've noticed is he's very passionate about helping people who deal with depression and he takes suicide very seriously so I'm watching this charity stream and I'm like why don't I make this a video so I can get a sponsor on the video and give the sponsors money that they give me to the charity and that's exactly what we're doing the sponsor of this video is quit I'm going to take the money quick gives me and gives it give it to ninja to help raise awareness for suicide prevention so basically quit is an app where you can collect cards and stickers from your favorite shows or games so some shows for example are like Game of Thrones Rick and Morty Dexter's laboratories for you nineties kids so quit is basically a card collecting app as you'll see over here you just open up packs of cards and each cards have a limited amount so you can get rare and epic cards that no one else in the world has you know it's basically like collecting cards but for the digital era and a really cool part about quit is I actually have my own packs on the app like I've literally done so many videos with them that they I literally have mr. beast cards on there and there's actually a lot of mr. beast packs so if you want to download quit and check those out that'd be cool but that's not it like they literally have every show you could think of up here that Breaking Bad I mean Archer Bob's burger whatever your favorite show is they probably have it here and all you do is you download quit and you can open up cards and packs and stickers and collect your stuff from your favorite shows and what's really cool about the stickers is you can actually text them to your friends like this so what I want you to do right now is download quit honestly it's a fun app it's pretty cool give it a try don't knock it till you try it and I want you to go on the meat tab and I want you to hit friends find friends and add mr. beast as a friend on quit acne as a friend what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna be replying to some messages on there I'm even gonna be damming some Amazon gift card codes to some people who download quit and add me as a friend and send me a message so you won't be entered into a chance to win a gift card literally just download quit add mr. beast as a friend send me a message and like I said dude just check out the app in start off pretty small and we'll do $1,000 all right we just did a thousand dollar donation let's see how he reacts I'm excited I love ninja thank you so much mr.
