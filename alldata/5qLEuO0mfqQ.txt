ladies and gentlemen if you know anything about Chess then you probably know the names Magnus Carlson and Hikaru Nakamura and that's because they are the two most handsome and also most popular chess players on the planet and we don't get to see them play against each other a lot because they're prize Fighters they don't just boot up chess.com and play 50 Blitz Games Against One Another like you and I would but rather we see them play in Elite competitions and recently we've been seeing them play a lot and in this video I'm going to show you a game that they played yesterday which as always is a certified Banger it goes platinum it is a FDA approved it is I mean it is non-GMO organic I mean these games are absolutely spectacular and yesterday's Blitz game was so fun I mean these guys just somehow provide an entertaining quality to all of their games and and you'll love to see it so first of all Magnus was uh despite playing with the black pieces in this game Magnus played all of title Tuesday playing H4 on move one and H5 move one with black like Magnus spent the entirety of the tournament playing that but then Hikaru hits the man with A3 see Karu really recently has just been playing A3 against Magnus and which is hilarious because this is like the stuff that Magnus does the people hikar doesn't let him do it to him now uh like a week or two ago I made a video where Magnus played the move C5 by the way the board might be a little bit glitchy uh that's because chess.com is at like Peak capacity right now made a video about it yesterday don't worry about it um and then in that game Hikaru played E4 in this game Hikaru uh rather Magnus plays E5 so now kikaru does the mirror image which is so funny I mean there's probably no better move against E5 right now than playing something like C4 and playing in English because in this move order it actually makes sense but it's so funny that like they just keep mirror Imaging each other with C5 and E4 anyway Magnus plays Knight F6 uh Hikaru plays this and we're actually in what's called a reverse Sicilian Defense so like it looks like black is playing white with E4 C5 and now we're kind of like in a night or so if Magnus plays the move D5 in this position Hikaru would capture on D5 and then we would get Knight captures on D5 and it looks like it's a night or of Sicilian except white is playing black and black is playing white so that doesn't happen Magnus tries to take advantage of the move order and play D5 we have Knight F3 and Magnus blunders upon on move four just kidding what is the problem with playing Knight takes Pawn what do you always need to look for in chess very good Checkmate free P checks captures attacks so if you take Knight takes Pawn black has two checks in this position one is stupid it loses a bishop the other one is Queen A5 and that hits these two pieces and you lose a knight shockingly Hikaru didn't blunder a piece in five moves he played Bishop G5 H6 went back and developed his pieces as follows Magnus played Bishop E6 Hikaru finished his development with the move Knight C3 and in this position uh rather than just kind of slow playing with castles uh Hikaru decided to attack the center right away with the move d4 so Magnus and Hikaru clashing sorry if I hit the microphone in the center of the board very tense position what is black gonna do well this trade looks fair to you because it's one Pawn for one Pawn but all pawn trades have a winner and a loser most trades have a winner and a loser in this case it would be Magnus who was the loser because the Knight hits the bishop so Hikaru is threatening to gain the bishop pair and the d-file will remain open so the queen will have long-term pressure on the pawn white would not take back in the center with the queen or the pawn uh because the queen would be a target for the black pieces and if you take with the pawn it would block your D file I hope that makes sense so Magnus instead keeps the tension like this this looks like it like might trap the bishop but it won't the bishop can just move here so kikaru plays Rook C1 Magnus goes here and now castles okay so both sides have completed their development they've castled they've moved some pawns what now right isn't this the hardest part of the game this is the game where you probably get out of your opening prep that you learned in one of my videos and go well now what right yeah that's chess I mean sometimes the game can have like 15 different combinations permutations simulations emulation stimulation I don't know I'm just I'm going nuts uh for both players okay and um you don't really know what's gonna happen right so Magnus plays Bishop G4 okay now Hikaru can do a million different things here he can Target the bishop he can move the queen he can bring the Rook he decides to go here and basically trade the Bishops right like he wants to reroute his Knight the problem is this is kind of a step backwards for the white position and Magnus just immediately capitalizes so he takes the pawn on D4 because if you will remember White's entire idea was to take in the center with the Knight so by doing this it's actually held black more than it's helped white and Magnus takes on D4 right away because now Hikaru is going to have to recapture with the pawn Hikaru is not going to take the bishop on G4 because after this and a long sequence of moves uh black will emerge on top so we have this Magnus trades and Hikaru plays Queen takes but see this trade like I said not all trades are equal this trade benefited black why did it benefit black because it's now Black's move and he's able to seize Central space right away black was very passive earlier uh this also creates a threat of hitting the queen so Hikaru is gonna have to move the queen again which is a waste of time for the white position because only black has made improvements so against Bishop G4 Hikaru probably should have played something mildly more energetic than Knight T2 is he losing no but black has a very pleasant position and you know I'm I'm sure Hikaru wasn't too thrilled with the outcome of this but he plays Queen to D3 and this transformation is also an improvement for black because now he has play against what's called an isolated Pawn isolated Pawn does not have neighbors on c and e and to successfully play against an isolated Pawn you need to control the square in front of it which is that square otherwise it will move forward and trading pieces helps so now Magnus takes advantage of the Obscure coordination of this queen which came out like this and like this and he plays Knight C5 so Magnus is slowly taking over and as you'll notice it's now a 30 second time discrepancy which is a lot it's like 25 of the allotted time bank right Knight C5 you cannot take it you cannot take it because of this so now hikaru's got to move his Queen again it goes back to its home Square not a good sign all right Magnus is now taking over he plays Knight to E6 the square in front of the pawn is blockaded this Pawn is a big weakness now if white plays very passively what black will do is probably trade off the bishop so he might play Knight D5 Bishop takes and even Rook takes is fine but the point is you're blocking the square in front of kikaru's Pawn you're not letting it move forward and you're gonna build behind it as you slowly apply pressure and ultimately win the pawn and ultimately win the game right so hikaru's got to act now and he knows that and Hikaru is so good at snapping out of a series of bad moves in mid game I've he's probably the best player on earth at doing that like Hikaru will play a few moves and visibly get upset at himself for playing those moves but he won't get mad at like it's not gonna affect his future moves he has this switch that he can flip mid game sometimes mid Street and he just right now he takes on F6 so he gets rid of the blockading piece and he shoves the pawn forward so he begins complicating matters he's like Magnus you want to beat me I'm 40 seconds down and the game is completely trending out of the direction that I wanted to and I'm still gonna find a way to take over now Magnus takes on D5 okay now if kikaru were to play Queen takes Magnus would probably take the Knight first Hikaru would probably take this and then he would take this and then he would take this and Magnus would probably just being annoying he would play Knight D4 and try to play rookie too and um so Queen takes Z5 is a possibility but there is also like you know he could take this way Hikaru does it this way he takes with the Knight Magnus plays Bishop D4 and now we have Knight ce3 and it looks like white is doing very well but why did Hikaru give up the B2 Pawn right well if he tried to hang on to all his pieces black would have played B5 and that would have been devastating because not only would Hikaru lose one Pawn he would probably lose both and just be two pawns down for nothing so what does Hikaru do he starts creating chaos despite being down to his last minute Bishop takes B2 Rook B1 Bishop A3 down two pawns but now he gets B7 so now Hikaru is only down one Pawn now admittedly it's an extremely annoying Pawn it's an outside pass pawn it is a Pawn on the opposite side of the board that the white pieces basically cannot deal with so knowing that you are going to have to deal with that pawn in the long run white needs to play fast okay Hikaru understands that what does that mean play fast that means create threats right now make black think about something because let me tell you something right now Magnus is gonna go here and literally push this Pawn he has a very powerful piece which controls the entire board on a diagonal these Knights are stupid and drunkenly stumbling over one another alright long night at the bar and this Pawn's just gonna walk so Hikaru plays win H5 all right only man I think on the planet who can stand up to magnesian style play as it's happening Queen H5 Magnus defense against Queen takes F7 I'm not even sure how many of you saw that move and in this position Hikaru plays a move that I I really like if I gave Grandmasters in the world an opportunity to play a move here I'm not sure it like I mean it is such a high level move it completely puts White's plans on hold and only looks at what does Magnus want what does black want here now a lot of you are going to say no these guys know how to do time and space and Harmony all together with their pieces so you know what they're gonna do here black is going to play the move let's say white goes rookie won black wants this that is what black wants to get rid of the aggressor in White's position trade this off and now free reign and now the white pieces are gonna have to go play defense and they're just not fast enough so Hikaru plays Queen H5 and follows it up with H4 which is not an attacking move it looks like it but it's not it prevents Queen G5 well look at his time last last movie at 56 seconds he spent almost all half his time on that move literally 29 seconds he plays H4 Magnus responds with the best move offering in exchange to hikaru's Rook hikaru's got a swap and he plays Knight to F5 right I told you Hikaru needs to play quickly energetically I'm telling you this is an insane game standing up to Magnus you cannot take this because I have Knight E7 which is a fork it's not even that I'm winning your Queen by discover check it's literally a fork so the amazing kind of Brotherhood of the horses you know Knight F5 sounds like a you know some sort of like chapter of House of the Dragon Brotherhood of the horses uh Knight F5 Knight D5 all going down this way sacrifices looming Magnus plays King H7 holding on to both pawns and Hikaru activates his rook and suddenly he's back in the game all right he has stood up to Magnus now Magnus once again plays the best move like all of these pieces standing around looking like there's threats on the queen Magnus plays the best move you know what the best move here for black is folks with the Rook staring down at your queen and you know all your pieces Under Fire the best move is the absolutely cold-blooded A5 that is the best move basically asking Hikaru what do you got let's go let's go let's fight you wanna you wanna fight let's go A5 A5 and I'm just gonna push my Pawn Hikaru has basically three or four turns until absolute disaster so where's the win magnus's King is completely protected how is Hikaru going to pull this off by playing the top engine move himself Queen G4 do you know what that does that prevents the pawn from moving forward oh my God he is attacking and he is defending at the same time he's taken his eye off this and this but now he's got eyes on G7 so he might play Knight F4 he might go here get rid of the Knight and then take on oh my God so Magnus plays Queen C8 and Hikaru here plays a ridiculous move Knight F6 check nine seconds on the clock the idea of Knight F6 is that after Pawn takes it's Queen H5 it's Queen H6 it's 97 made but there is a top engine move here four Magnus to play defense with one of them is completely ridiculous uh the other one is the move Queen C5 defending the E7 Square against the Knight and threatening this but with just 10 seconds on the clock roughly for both players as time is ticking Magnus thinks it's too risky and plays King back to ha it is 9 seconds versus 12. now Hikaru could continue to bulldoze with Knight H6 and so on he plays Queen H5 all right now the Knight on F6 is completely Untouchable but Queen H5 is a massive mistake because Hikaru should have played faster now maybe he thought you know a draw was not good enough he could have tried to force a draw here if G takes H6 he can go here and there is a Perpetual check but he decides to play Queen H5 and Magnus finds defense from across the board Queen down to C2 oh God imagine getting hit with this move from Magnus Carlson with seven seconds on the clock he's threatening Queen F2 he's got eyes on this he's got eyes on this he's got eyes on that in the future if he wants it what does Hikaru do cold-blooded Rook F1 played instantly didn't even lose a second Rook F1 just playing defense Magnus once again plays the best move Queen D2 completely controlling the white rook and also defending H6 so Pawn takes Knight becomes a possibility what does Hikaru do Knight back to E4 they both with one second on the clock Hikaru plays 94. one second on the clock Knight E4 is on the board how does he have enough time to even make a move Max plays Queen F4 Queen F4 hits this what does Hikaru Knight comes back to G3 now black is completely winning Hikaru just barely avoiding time but Queen hitting the pawn on the other side of the board in this position magnus's best move is F5 utilizing the free space where the Knight just was that attacks the Knight and there's really loud dirt bikes outside oh my goodness oh my I'ma just say this right now if you got a car that loud you're just a terrible person that's all you know I'm just nobody likes you really now if you have a car that's like quieter you're great you're loved of course um now if Knight C3 Queen takes G3 and the bishop pins the pawn to the king F5 would have been it but with this little time on the clock you're basically making quick moves in your head so you're seeing Queen hits Pawn no problem A4 and Hikaru again with no time on the clock finds Queen A5 which is a fork but black is still winning but he's only winning if he finds a bishop move giving up the pawn and once again this F5 idea Magnus it all comes down to this F5 idea prying the fingers apart all right prying the hands apart as they hold on to the edge of the cliff like in Lion King E4 G3 right the Magnus misses it and plays this thinking Hikaru is going to take the pawn but in a catastrophic time scramble mistake he's blundered his Bishop now he finds F5 but he had to find it a move earlier but now they're both down to one and two seconds Hikaru Knight C5 on the board Magnus can play Queen D4 here pinning the Knights of the queen complete chaos white would have had to find Queen E7 unpinning and hitting both but instead of that we have Knight F4 and Hikaru just takes this is not made because Knight takes Knight and in this position Magnus ran out of time but he's also just losing he's down tonight oh my goodness these two provide such high quality games even with no time on the clock like their openings once we get past them once we get past this A3 business um they play such high level chess like the tension in the position right Hikaru looking to simplify Magnus taking over the initiative playing against the isolated Pawn Hikaru blowing the position open so that his isolated Pawn is not a liability finding these ridiculous measures to sacrifice material and understanding time space Harmony boom Queen H5 playing quickly H4 H4 is the move of the game as far as I'm concerned like such a ridiculously high level move understanding that black wants to trade the queen and fight back and he spent all his time on it Magnus also a high level defense A5 and It ultimately comes down to this absurd time scramble and Hikaru I mean just a just ridiculous vision amazing and then obviously I mean you blunder with four seconds on the clock it happened so hikaru's gotten the better of Magnus several games in a row now in these title Tuesdays and let me know if you enjoyed the videos I mean on the one hand
