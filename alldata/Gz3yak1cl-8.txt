- This is the circle. Before your torture begins,
let's go over the rules. This white line is the
outside of the circle. You can step one foot out, but if both feet leave, you're out. You do not win the 10 grand. See this purple line? Don't cross it with your feet. You can reach across it with your arms. Don't cross in other
quadrants with your feet. You can step on it, but
you can't do it like that. Any other questions? - Can I throw my poop? - So Garrett chose that quadrant. Chandler chose this quadrant. Chris, which quadrant are you choosing? - I think this quadrant
is my kind of quadrant. - All right. And Tyler, that leaves
you with that quadrant. All right, that is all Chandler's stuff, and it's all in his quadrant. So this is all Chris's stuff. - Pop-Tarts.
- Pop-Tarts. Lots of other snacks,
blanket, toilet paper. Any other fun stuff you
wanna show the viewers? We don't have to give it all away. Ooh, okay. All right.
- Yeah. - And then you got your poop bucket. Last person. Tyler, what do you have?
- Lots of bread. - 'Cause you did get lots of bread. So everyone else went
pretty heavy on food. You didn't really go too heavy on food. You just got bread and peanut butter. You went more for survival stuff. - I have the bread of life, the Bible.
- The Bible. 9:50... It's blurry. It's 9:57, three minutes
until we begin boys. Chris is helping him build a tent. He has a minute and like 20 seconds left. All know is it's 10 O'clock.
- It's 10 O'clock. All right, you can still
build, but it's 10 O'clock. If both your feet leave this white circle, you get nothing. Last one of you to leave the
white circle wins 10 grand. No peeing in other people's quadrants. Chandler is having his first sip of water. How about you, Garrett? What do you- - I had my first sip of water as well. - Just a little update, guys. It's actually really hot. Everybody's feeling it, right? So I went ahead and got pretty much naked except for my underwears. It's gonna be hard. Are you filming me? Are you filming me vlogging right now? - Yep, yep.
- Oh my goodness. - But I thought of
something really important. Chandler, who do you think will win? - Chandler. - Hey, Garrett, who do you think will win? Wait, you think Chandler's gonna beat you? - Yeah, I think Chandler's gonna win. - Chris, who do you think will win? - Chris. - Tyler, who do you think will win? - Chandler. - Oh, he's just saying that to confuse the viewers. They all think they're gonna win. And guess what? Only one of you get $10,000. - All right, it is 10:12. - Oh, so you guys have only
been in here 12 minutes? - I mean, finally, after
15 minutes I did it. - 15? You started at 9:00-- - That was an hour! Took an hour to build this tent. Hey guys, I'm about to go to bed soon. - All right, Chandler, what time is it? - It's 11:25 PM.
- 11:25. It's getting pretty late. Chris is being a sleepy boy. He's being a sleepy boy. These two are getting
ready to be sleepy, boys. You doing good over there?
- Yeah. I got my tent up.
- Oh yeah. Dude, you were getting so
frustrated, it was funny. Chandler, Garrett, Tyler, Chris, you keep an eye on each other. Don't let each other step out. Technically, you could step
out if no one's looking but if someone catches you you're gone. - So Chandler said he really doesn't kind
of wanna do this anymore, but he's not gonna quit. He said he was just gonna
annoy the piss out of us. So Chandler's dad said, if
he felt like not doing it, then give him a call
and he'd motivate him. - Chris offered me $300
to leave right now. - 300?
- Yeah. - He lost his mind. Tell him you'll leave right now for 1,500. - Ooh.
- Oh! Ooh. Chandler wants to leave. Chandler asked me to, did anybody want to buy his land? And he was gonna sell it for 300 bucks, which, I mean-
- Oh my God. I knew, when I got home, I said, "That boy's not gonna last
through the night probably." - 350. - No, 500, man. He's gotta gimme 150 of it. - Come on. He gets to go home. - 500, that's a good deal. You have so much money. That's a lot of money. And it's only if you win. - All right, have fun sitting through
the night, Chandler. - Yeah, it is. - Chandler's now trying
to sell off his snacks. "$30 a snack" he says, like
he's a freaking airplane. - Dude, it's a good deal. - It is not! It's $30, I have bread and peanut butter. What else do I need? - All right, well, I'm kind of bored. I want 500, like-
- How long has this been? - It's start of Saturday. - It's been about two hours almost. - It's been two hours and you gave up. - I haven't. I'm not out of the
circle yet, so I mean... Give me a deal, 500, that's a good- - It'll be 20 bucks for all your snacks. - Get out here. What do you think this is? What, do you want me to starve? - I think you're about to
lose your spot to Jimmy in like minutes. Oh, you're not gonna get up now? - No. If I don't get anything out of it, no. What's the point? - That's really gonna rough it, right? - Yeah.
- In your chair? - Yep.
- In your bed chair. - Yep. - Chandler, that was the
poorest decision ever. - I didn't make the decision, I just offered and no one said yes. - No, I'm talking about buying a chair! Where did your money go to, man? - I got Gushers. So my dad's trying to get someone to fill in for him at his job. - Chandler, it's been two hours! - Come on, bro.
- What the heck? - Sorry, I don't have a bed to sleep on. What up? My dad's calling me. Hello? - I can't get up with . - What about Brother Bobby? - Brother Bobby's been hit by a car. He can't even freaking walk, someone in little knee scooters. - Oh. - Right? He was drunk while crossing
the road and got hit by a car. - Oh my God. Right, Dad, I'm losing patience. - Dude, what-
- Okay. Like you gotta get home and do something. What the hell are you gonna do? - Sleep. - You got an option to get off work for four days straight. - It's Wednesday. They're gonna be here
till like next Wednesday. - No, they won't. If I had a little more warning, I'd have prepared better
than what you did. And my would be at camp there. - I asked you what to get. - And you got a chair. - You got a chair that my big wouldn't fit in. - Chandler spent like six
bucks on Fruit Roll-Ups, but $5 on his chair. - Dude, I saw a box in the floorboard. - All right, man. I'll be here. - Dude, go to sleep. - I'm not tired though, that's the thing. All right, bye-bye. - Keep going, man. You're getting by.
- All right. - Chandler's dad, exact words. "If you leave, I'll beat your ." - Oh, you gotta survive. You should buy healthy food. Chandler's like, "Oreos,
that's gonna help me survive." - Hey, I got beef jerky too. - All right guys, I'm
taking my first poop. Got a nice little toilet seat. I dunno if you saw that, but- - Are you pooping? - I'm going to be going
to bed here in a second. - Chris, can I vlog? - Yeah, you can. - Soccer Dad here. Gonna go to sleep. Love y'all. - Though these guys are gonna
burn out of their energy super quick. - It's your boy, Garrett, I'm so awake. It's nighttime, everybody's
asleep except for Chris. - Hello.
- And Chandler. - Garrett sprayed Silly String on my tent and now there's ants everywhere. So I'm never leaving again. I got bit everywhere. - Hey. - Get that away from me. - Yoh paparazzi. I have to pee so immensely, badly. Wanna watch? - We all officially made
it through the first night. I went to bed at like 12:00,
woke up like once or twice. It wasn't the worst sleep I've ever had. The only thing is we're all kinda, everybody would agree,
we're all kind of sweaty. It's not bad. The rule was, if you're
close enough to the computer, reach it, you can use it. So put on some chill music
just so we could all relax. Yeah, Tyler walked out of his tent and literally got destroyed by ants. You know I love you. Hugs and kisses. - Yeah, I need like a- - Garrett, tell us what you're having
for breakfast there. - Milkshake Pop-Tarts.
- Milkshake Pop-Tarts. So me and Tyler, and
you're in on it too, right? We are not gonna be eating. Our strategy, we're not eating. If you don't eat, you
don't have to poop, so... See that sun right there? It's hot. Everybody's being affected by it. - All right, Chris, who do you think will
be the first to leave? - I mean, judging by last night... - I got it outta my system, okay. Chandler, the mental games are not
looking on your side. - See, Chandler- - I think Chandler's gonna win
and he's gonna leave first. - See Chandler, maybe. I've seen Garrett's been on Tinder, so. - Some girl's- - He's gotta get a booty
call and it will be like- - If it's someone hot, "I want
you to come over right now. "I don't wanna date. "I just want you to come over tonight." - I'm looking out for his fake accounts. Don't worry about it. - I'm a creative fake douche.
- Catfish! - I'm a catfish.
- He has, keep in mind he has three phones and all the time in the world, so. - You gotta be bored. I don't wanna make this easy on you. - I'm bored.
- I'm not. - I'm gonna have to
remove your electricity. - So we all have a prediction. We think that Jimmy's
gonna break before us, 'cause he misses us so bad. Just sitting here, drinking water, telling stories about our yester years. We're actually talking about movies. So it's kinda like watching a movie. I guess that's why they did
back in the caveman days, they just talked about like
Nicholas Cage movies and stuff. - It's 1:16. Garrett's trying to sleep. Chris is laying down, I don't
know if he's trying to sleep. He's got some kind of cloth over his face. - I'm making my first sandwich,
got two pieces of bread. Take bananas and cut
'em into little slices. And then on the other piece of bread, you spread peanut butter on it. And it's a peanut butter-banana sandwich. It's unbearably hot, which isn't really
getting to me that much. My wife works night shift and we don't ever get to see each other. And Friday, Saturday, and Sunday are the only days we get
to spend time together. Like I haven't seen her
at all this entire week, and it's Thursday today. So I'd really like to see her, and I feel like I'm gonna crack. The other guys are asleep right now, but I really think I'm gonna crack because I would really like to see her. - I'm not asleep. - I'm not gonna crack, but I might have to make a
deal with somebody or something because I could stay
here, but I'd rather not. So if somebody offers me
a sweet amount of money, I'll probably do so. - Stay number two. It's been kind of rough. Just woke up from a long nap. Anyways, I'm gonna hand the
camera off to somebody else so they get a chance to vlog. But I'm winning this
10K, no doubt about it. - I haven't been vlogging that much. I'm focusing on surviving. These guys are decent, Chris
is my big competitor right now. He's got a tent. But I'm literally gonna sit
in here as long as it takes 'cause I kind of need this 10K. Garrett and Chandler, they're probably gonna
get rained on pretty soon. So I'm thinking that I
have a very good chance, I've just gotta knock out Chris. Once I get Chris, it's all
downhill from there, so. - So word on the street is you're trying to quit, Chris. - So Tyler said that he thinks that I'm
his biggest competitor. So he said he would gimme
$1,000 if I walked away now. - That's if he won! But if Tyler doesn't win you get nothing. - No insult to Tyler, but Tyler literally has no life, and he will sit here until I freaking die. So I'd rather just go
ahead and get $1,000, and not spend five days
here and get nothing. - Are you auctioning off
your tent to one of them? - Yeah. - You want some gold fish? - Yeah, I'll take your
goldfish for my tent. - Try it. - Did everyone agree on the trade? - I'm gonna prove that
I don't need a tent. - 'cause you're screwed honestly. Chris, are you sure you wanna do this? Once both feet cross,
you can't win 10 grand. All right, no 10 grand for
Chris, he's officially out. No longer a joke. Tyler who owns that quadrant
now gets Chris's quadrant, but he has to give Chris $1,000 if he win. That was their deal.
- Yep. - All right, to make things simpler. Tyler's getting these two squares and Garrett's taking Chris's tent. 'Cause we don't- - That way we don't have to move the tent. - Yep.
- I'm never leaving. - Never leaving?
- I'm never leaving! - One down, two to go. This chair that was once
Garrett's, now goes over here. And if he wants it, he has to
leave the circle to get it. - So you're the underdog right now, right? - Yes. - Why do you think that is? - I don't have a tent. Everyone's hating on me. I have no supporters. - Chandler, where do
you think I went wrong? - You got married. That's your first mistake. - Katie's gonna kill you. - Sorry Katie, love you. - So what do you think, what do you think your competitive
edge over these guys is? - I'm crazy. - You have what now?
- Oreos. - Oh, you think Oreos- - And Doritos and Gushers. - Is that your competitive edge? - Yeah. - We've all bonded here together, right? - Yes. - I think we know a lot
more about each other. Garrett actually, he's a priest. We didn't know that. - It's like almost seven
O'clock and Chris is gone. No one thinks we're gonna win. - Pretty much, it's just
me, Chandler, and Tyler. We're all just kind of
like ignoring each other 'cause we're in like the hate stage. We all hate each other right now. - I'll offer you $1,000
to leave right now. Jim, guess what? I just offered Garrett. - What'd you offer him? - A thousand, and then he said, yes. - But that's only if
you win, he gets $1,000. - He knows. - So you're gonna go up
against Tyler, forever? - I have to prove you wrong. As you can see, he's on the way to confirm this situation and I'm one step closer
to beating this dude. - There's no way. Chandler is gonna buy out Garrett, which literally means that
I'm just gonna win this because I didn't even
have to buy out Garrett. This is the easiest thing ever. - I'm like super tired right now. I'm just chilling in Chris' tent 'cause Chris sucks, 'cause he lost. But I'm about to do the same thing. I'm about to cop out. He offered me a thousand
dollars for my lot, and I really do believe
that he's gonna win. - All right guys, feeling
pretty confident right now. Jimmy's on his way, so he
can confirm Garrett leaving for the $1,000 I've given him. - I'm leaving. - He's using his phone. Garrett, you are leaving. - No, I'm not. - It is 8:10. I got a multi-case. So it's been 23 hours and 10 minutes, and Garrett wants to tap. Did you get a match on Tinder? - No! Matter of fact, I did. - You did?
- I did. - Yeah?
- Yeah I did. - She wants to hang out tomorrow? - She wants to hang out tonight. - Wait really?
- Yeah. Now look at me. Now look down here. This is how you exit the circle. One foot out.
- One foot out. - One foot in. - Foot in the Orvus, and this next- - Now I'm a loser! - You cannot win 10 grand. You have put both feet out. All right, now, you own that quadrant
over there with the tent. - And you owe me $1,000 if you win. - Garrett is giving Chandler his quadrant and Chandler has agreed, if he wins, to give Garrett a thousand of the dollars. You now own that quadrant
and that quadrant. Tyler owns this quadrant
and this quadrant. Chandler, are you sure
you don't want that tent? - I'm 100% sure. - You are stupid. - Who do you think this is? - Yeah, but why?
- You think I'm a chump? - You could have had a free tent. The circle is cut in half
with that line right there. It's a little blurred. This half is Tyler's. That half is Chandler. - The odds are stacked against me, but I'm gonna pull out the win. - Yep.
- And get this 10,000. - Are you gonna have Chris' wife's sister bring you food while he's asleep. - Is that allowed? - I don't know. I just wanted to bring up that you're dating Chris' wife's sister. - Well, there you go. - Well, you have fun on your Tinder date. I'm gonna keep babysitting
these guys all night. You just... - Have fun.
- Yeah. All right, we're talking to
Chandler's dad if he picks up. I just wanted to let you know that it's down to Chandler and Tyler. They're the only two left. - Oh my God. - Who do you think will win? Your son or Tyler? - Tyler's mighty hardheaded. - Yeah? Do you have any words of
motivation for Chandler? I mean, he's doing pretty good. He wanted to quit, but
now he's in the final two. Like, you helped him last
time, can you help him again? - Better not quit now. - Yeah. - His car's about to fall apart. - And I need the money. I need the money. - Yes, absolutely. - All right.
- Chandler, you better not leave, boy.
- All right. - Chandler, I'm pulling for you, brother. Tyler, I'ma get you tonight
about midnight, bro. - Bring it. It is nine O'clock. We have been the only two
that have survived 24 hours. Everyone else has bailed. Air high-five. - Don't touch me.
- But I'm gonna still win. Right Chandler?
- No. All right, guys, it's
about, like 11:40 at night. I'm getting really tired of being here. - All right, what's up guys? It's Friday. Went through the whole night. Slept pretty well, willing to stay out here
as long as it takes. Pretty much everything I've been saying, other than, it's the next day. And I don't know. I think Chandler's
looking kind of defeated and I think I'm gonna take this one. - All right, guys. How you doing? Chandler, you good? Chandler, you sent me a
text a little while ago. What did you wanna? You said you weren't feeling it anymore. - Yeah. - But it's $10,000. - Chandler, I'll be honest with you. I'm about to quit right now. And I'm just kidding. I'm here for a while. - Tyler has a tent. I think Tyler's gonna last a long time. - For real? - I'm done.
- Really? Are you sure?
- Are you serious? - If you step over that line, you can't win 10 grand. Yes! Man, that's what I'm talking about! - Shake hands-
- Let's go! - Shake hands. I want you guys to be good sports. - You're a hard competitor.
- Yeah, yeah. - I appreciate it, thanks. - Chandler, the viewers appreciate you. - Can I step out now?
- Yeah. Yeah, I mean, you already won 10 grand. - I'm free! Thank God. Oh, I was on my final legs. I only had like three more weeks left. - At least three more weeks. - Tough. - 'Cause you had a tent. All right, Tyler.
- Hey. - There's your 10 grand. - Hey!
- Enjoy it. ♪ Please don't, please don't ♪ ♪ Please don't, please don't ♪ ♪ Please don't, please don't ♪♪
