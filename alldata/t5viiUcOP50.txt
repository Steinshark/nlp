ladies and gentlemen in the World of Sports there are some very historic rivalries I'm talking about Yankees versus Red Sox I'm talking Knicks Boston Celtics other sports like Real Madrid versus Barcelona you name it most sports have a very big rivalry and chess is no different in chess one of the greatest rivalries is that of the botes sisters talking about Alexander botes and Andrea botes of botes life and yesterday April 29th 2024 they were paired for the first time ever in a chess tournament against each other a serious classical chess tournament against one another and I'm going to break down the game for all of you and whatever you think of Chess influencers or the bowest sisters in particular was a very instructive game and there's a lot to learn and this is a very uh intriguing matchup because they've never played each other uh and they Trash Talk each other all the time and they're very close in strength so here we go also I just got back from Europe a little bit jet lagged also my allergies are like ridiculous of I sound disgusting in this video I sound disgusting in every video uh but uh please excuse me I was in K in Germany and then I went to Brussels for 24 hours amazing City Brussels was incredible uh and if any of you took a picture with me on this trip and then I went to Amsterdam for a few days and I went to denh uh which was great uh so those are the three cities I I visited I was only there for a week with my wife and I'll be back so many of you have been inviting me to European cities uh where you live and and so on and so forth and I think the next time I come back I will do a proper tour we'll do some Live Events and I I hope it'll be great uh and I will be in Spain I will be playing in a chess tournament in Spain and also doing uh the match there between Jose Martinez and Vladimir karnick that will be in June let's get into this Darby day this Manchester United Man City this Chelsea versus Tottenham is that a rivalry I don't know Andrea botes with the white pieces opens up with Pawn to D4 and that is because she only knows one opening uh I'm not trying to insult her if anything this will motivate her to learn more openings she literally only knows the London so for all of you people out there who are like I only know the London like sometimes chess fans talk to me on the street and they say I only play the London so does she it's literally she doesn't know any other opening and Alexander botes plays normally like the king's Indian which is like they play the same openings they are they are sisters they play the exact same openings but in this game Alexandra goes for E6 which is a main line and there are already certain things about this setup for white that matter if black does not play the move D5 black has sort of played like a NSO Indian type of setup and if black plays B6 here one of my favorite lines to play is Queen F3 this is in my London course and it's a little bit of a stupid move but the point is that you know black then has to pin their own bishop and they can't move it quite as easily and then you very quickly Castle get an interesting position but Alexander plays D5 now we're just in a Mainline London we're in something that has been studied many many times Knight F3 black once again has many setups Black can play C5 now black can delay C5 black can put the bishop on E7 or D6 uh and uh she plays C5 right away which is the most principled move Andrea plays C3 which is the most principal move and the main line in the London you are taught C5 C3 C5 C3 uh Knight C6 Knight bd2 and now black has a choice so the London has been studied and meta studied and Giga Mega studied and Omega super Giga studied and turbo studied and you know black can take on D4 and play Knight H5 that's a line CD Ed Knight H5 like this has been tried at the high level uh also black can play Bishop D6 which is the main line also black can play Bishop B7 which is kind of like a sneaky move trying to get this bishop uh black can also play like A6 B like black can waste time and just kind of pass back the move to White uh Alexandra plays the main line Bishop to D6 just trying to trade Bishops and there's a rule of thumb if black can successfully play E5 in the London then black is completely fine so if black can get this position uh black is not worse at all which is why Bishop D6 is played and generally with why what you do when you get hit with Bishop D6 is you rotate back because you would like to be captured because if you get captured in Black castles you will have some attacking potency in the position that is the idea right so Bishop G3 so far both players in their prep castles Bishop to D3 this is the main line this has been the main line of the London system for like 7 years now this position uh there have been other trends like I said black can capture sooner black can delay the move C5 but if black plays the main line black plays the main line and actually white now has an option here to play a few different things white can play Bishop E2 Bishop D3 and there is this move Bishop to B5 which has been played by none other than Grandmaster gakamsky World Championship Contender for many years uh and he plays a lot now as well and he actually streams and this move is kind of trappy the best move here for black is to rotate the Knight over here uh but uh there's you know there's a trap like for example Queen C7 loses a pawn because you walk into a pin and now DC is just winning a pawn uh I actually had this in an over theboard game once and I hung onto my pawn and I went on to win uh but that's sort of the idea Bishop to B5 but Andrea plays Bishop D3 and Alexandra plays B6 uh after a few minutes of thought which is you know strange because this position has happened many many times so black has three main lines here B6 Queen E7 to play E5 and Rook E8 to play E5 so black can play two different moves that allow you know prepare E5 and against those moves white will frequently play Knight to E5 uh and there's a trap here uh in certain lines where you know if the Knight drops back too quickly uh you can you can land a really devastating attack um there's uh you know black plays something like Bishop D7 white will play F4 and go on go on another very big attack so after Bishop D3 Alexandra does in fact play this move B6 and now Andrea spends a lot of time uh if that's right I don't know why she spent 20 minutes on that move uh but she spent 20 minutes on that move um the other move if you don't play Knight E5 the main move against B6 is immediately opening the attack on the center with E4 and if black doesn't know the theory here black could get a very bad position very fast the best move for black against E4 is so counterintuitive like if you don't know the move here you will never play it the best move for black is to just get the bishop back to E7 what why why would you allow E5 well E5 Knight H5 and this bishop can't move Bishop can't move there and there and somehow it's very difficult for white to create an attack the best move for white is Knight G5 attacking the pawn and doing an you know creating an attack here then you play Queen H5 and then Queen E2 and then the game continues like CD H4 Bishop D2 check you lose a pawn but then you get the pawn back and you try to play for H5 like it's very complicated line very very complicated line so the best line is to go back to E7 because if you take on e4 after takes takes takes this is hanging and after it gets protected white plays DC Bishop C5 Queen A4 attacking this and if black plays something like Queen C8 you have Bishop H7 check King H7 you rotate the queen you get a Greek gift and you're winning you got to know all of that if you don't know that you'll never play E4 like that's because you're taught in the London like you you have your pyramid but but there are moments E4 is good for example E4 is not particularly good let's say in this position because after this exchange this is not hanging black doesn't have to defend it black will take on D4 the point is that now since that Knight is hanging you can go for this E4 idea but Andrea plays Knight E5 which is completely fine uh now the main line is Bishop B7 and white plays F4 gets the Stonewall structure this is the idea of the London system and now if you give white a few more turns with Queen F3 for example and then like Bishop H4 white will generate a winning attack this is a completely winning completely dominating attack black is not fast enough on that side of the board I mean black can arrive you take the Knight you threaten mate the game is over like wh's attack is dominant and this is why the London is one of the nicest openings to play if you know the ideas that is sort of the point you get the Stonewall structure Alexandra did not play Bishop B7 she played Queen C7 which has been played Here Comes The Stonewall and so now I think you know sibling rivalry especially when you're the older sibling you know you you try to let the younger sibling win some of the wrestling matches right I don't think these two were like fighting like physically but that's what you got to do you got to let the younger sibling win every now and then it's like a big dog and a little dog all right like the big dog sometimes rolls over because you got to you know you got to take turns that's how you you know you play and so here Alexandra kind of plays posum she kind of like you know she covers up she like oh no the attack is so strong no now what she should do like she can Counterattack all right like she's not in any danger yet it's completely fine we're far away rotating this Knight back is always a good idea because you can block this bishop as well it's a hard move to to play if like you don't study these positions like a like a nerd uh so she takes on D4 which is not uh a bad move according to the computer but strategically it's a small inaccurate because it's okay like it's it's it's completely fine in my opinion but you give white the E file right like white used to have a pawn there they don't now so now the queen is very good there and now black doesn't have a queen side attack and you know sometimes black may want to have a queen side attack not not now but just in the future so she takes this and before Andrea can get anything going she plays G6 which is the best move the best move plays G6 and um and uh now she's sort of like all right come beat me like I'm I'm I'm saying this you can't have an attack I mean and Knight E5 all of this this is to have an attack if I'm playing white I'm thinking H4 it doesn't work because black goes here you bring your queen out all right then black just you know kicks your knight out like where you going to go you you you going to sacrifice maybe but then where's the attack this is blocked this is blocked everything is blocked it's actually a very good strategy because now Andrea as the younger sibling has to Play Patiently she can't play aggressive chess she has to play it slow she has to play Queen F3 she has to play Bishop H4 and maybe if you slowly improve your position you're going to get something right because black is going to try to trade and if black makes a a bad move now you have Queen H3 it's still not particularly clear where the attack is but the attack will slowly arrive you know it's just going to very slowly very very you know slowly methodically and again you see how Alexandra traded this Pawn she has nothing now it's going to take her a long time to generate more play and by the time she can you rip open the position you take on D7 you play Bishop F6 and queen h8 m is just Unstoppable so she got to play it slow all right now Bishop F2 okay I you know fine she's trying to get out of the way and and now she needs to bring the queen next Alexandra plays A5 and A5 is trying to create something on the queen side because she doesn't have a c Pawn anymore all right she doesn't have a c pawn and she's trying to go Bishop A6 very common idea so for example Queen F3 black is considering Bishop A6 and the thing about this position is it's actually okay to trade the bishop because at the end of the day you have one very important resource in this position which is this move A4 and black has no forward Mobility on the queen side anymore black cannot play B5 or A4 and black doesn't have a c Pawn black can't play Knight B4 or Bishop B4 so white completely controls the queen side now if White rotates a knight to B5 like B1 A3 B5 you're going to go from having an attack to playing a little bit more of a positional game but Andrea plays Queen E2 Queen E2 stops Bishop A6 but she didn't really have to like she could have just played aggressively because she has all the makings of in fact the best move here according to the engine is just straight up G4 because after this you can trade and guess what you can kick the rug back maybe you even play H4 like H4 F5 you can't play H4 right now cuz probably H5 is quite strong but that's the idea so Queen E2 now Knight H5 a very nice move from Alexandra who makes white play defense this is not what white wants to do white wanted all the pawns on the fourth rank moving together and now Alexander plays a very very interesting idea she wanted to play F6 but what she didn't want was this this she did not want that trade so what she does is she actually plays Knight back to B8 with with the same concept I've shown you this move Knight E7 and the idea is basically now this Knight cannot relieve itself pause like I didn't mean like P or poo I meant like you know it can't you can't relieve the pressure and take on C6 so she plays Knight B8 and now white really has a moment here where you got to like think for a second go all right so F6 is on the way right so what if I Castle right and then black is going to go F6 like do I play Knight F3 you know and then again it's a big battle for the big question is can black play E5 if the answer is no well then white is going to be okay the other idea of Knight to be8 by the way was to play Bishop A6 I just told you about this she's really trying to trade off White's Bishop right so Knight B8 now A4 from Andrea controlling talked about that move already so it's a pretty high level game I think up to this point they were playing like 95 96 % accuracy and now this move F6 and a very big moment you can go back you can go back you can sacrifice the Knight to open up Black's King you can also leave the Knight but leaving the Knight is dumb because you're only going to get one Pawn so you just lost the Knight for a pawn you don't really have anything and Andrea here decides you know what I've had enough of being the younger sibling I'm going to sacrifice my knight and attack Alexandra Knight takes G6 and and when you sacrifice a knight you can apply general principles or you can apply specific principles general principles are you should not sacrifice a piece like this unless you have two more attacking pieces than they have Defenders does white have two more attacking pieces than they have Defenders no however there are exceptions you know for example if you play Queen G4 now and queen H4 Queen H7 yeah that looks pretty good but then maybe black plays E5 Queen H4 is mate they move the Knight you know etc etc you got to keep calculating and it's a close game it's close so she sacrifices the Knight right she plays Bishop G6 the engine is is calling it what it is it's like well you know black is up a pawn so it's minus one uh black plays Knight G7 and so now white needs to figure out how to get more of an attack going cuz black is going to start opening the center the best way to strike back over here on a flank attack is to strike back in the center of the board and I talked about general principles I use this rule of plus two the general principles specifically when you talk about specifics you need moves like when you calculate in chess when when players sit back here and they go Knight takes Pawn takes Bishop takes attacking the Knight the knight's going to go there okay in that position I need to find the best move for white is it bringing my queen or is it bringing my pawn and the best move is is to bring the queen you need the queen to hang out for a constant threat this is incorrect this is too slow I mean in theory it looks very nice and black has a limited amount of time right and one thing I I've been doing recently is I've been turning off the eval bar because you don't know what the evaluation is during a game right so one move that black can already consider is striking back in the center with E5 it's a very thematic move and if the Center opens up black is going to be really close to ruining the white position white is just not going to land the attack in time uh Alexandra brings the Knight back to C6 which makes sense she's trying to Target the center and she's trying to trade Whit's only attacking piece on G6 uh Andrea plays H5 right spends a little bit of time plays H5 and you know she's but she's only attacking with a bishop and a pawn just inherently something should feel a little bit off just a little bit like and black should be able to defend herself and now Alexandra while being attacked on the edge of the board she does in fact strike back with this move E5 and um now white needs to be very careful the right way of going all in here with white is to take on E5 once it's very important you don't take with the F Pawn because then everything falls apart you have to take with the D pawn and then what you do is you have to Castle why like this because the f file is closed and the diagonal is closed and the f file is still closed and the diagonal is still closed and the point is now you bring your Rook right you bring your rook and now you actually have a claim to an an attack you get your king out of the way and you bring your Rook that is the way that that that white had to White had to just bite the just Castle Queen Side open the position and do it that way now she went H6 which is a completely reasonable move but now she needs to do it again she has to go takes takes long Castle because after takes you just open everything up like I don't even care about Knight F4 all right although trying to think do you lose your Bishop completely here I was hoping I had some trick but maybe you just lose your Bishop all right I do care about Knight F4 so we don't take this Pawn we do something else like bring back the queen or play G4 G5 I mean black is going to defend themselves with best play the sacrifice on G6 was flawed for several reasons uh but that's life I mean that's that's what happens so Queen G4 is what Andrea chooses she's threatening all sorts of different things and uh Alexandra just very calmly moves the king to h8 and now I mean the amount of money white would spend to get rid of the H Pawn your own Pawn blocks your attack and there's just nothing you can do about it I like this move F5 but Knight G5 gets in the way black has too many defensive pieces I said you need two more attacking pieces than white that than black has Defenders this is still the only attacking piece the queen cannot get in you could go H7 it it doesn't do anything because I'm not going to take right I'm not going to take Knight G5 and now yeah it goes from bat to worse here Andrea castles and once you start castling in this position it's a bad sign also you have two minutes on the clock black plays Knight E7 this is going to be traded off you will have zero attacking pieces remaining you cannot even take so she takes on E5 Bishop E5 and that's it I mean this is all you got this is all you got to show for the sacrifice Queen E2 there comes the bishop white is officially completely out of attacking pieces and the older sibling will be taking over The Game King goes to G2 the pawn Falls in front of the king and only one king is on safe here and it is not the botes king ha it's funny because they're both bz's Bishop takes B6 is a desperation attempt trying to get Queen B6 Rook F5 which is still winning for black but uh black plays Knight to H4 check the King goes here and now black is up a bishop and the Knight now if you could teleport your queen to G7 it is made but that is not possible white plays Queen D3 attacking the bishop Bishop B5 also very nice time management from Alexandra up 27 minutes that'll do it so if it was 1 minute for black and 27 for white maybe there's still a blunder possible Rook d8 uh and the easiest thing to do here by far simplify put the Rook on the second rank Rook to H2 is a Checkmate and two threat King G3 Knight H3 mate and in this position Andrea resigned and the older sibling Alexander botes reign supreme defeating the pesky London system the best way to defeat the pesky London system which is play a main line play like you know nine to 10 moves implement the game plan and the thing is the London is easy but if you don't know The Cutting Edge ideas like E4 for example you can very easily play All the Right ideas but not take the Right Step at the right moment not capitalize on based on the way your opponent is playing and then you'll find yourself in a difficult situation now Andrea didn't really do that she actually played completely fine she played F4 she put all the and this is an incorrect idea as far as I'm concerned for black like I would love to see that in one of my games but Alexandra just played very solid she just said you know what if you're if I'm just not going to let you attack me and then white was kind of stuck between do I attack or do I play solidly this was a very nice idea and Andrea got aggressive at the right moment at wrong moment she did not get aggressive at the right moment is what I was trying to say she got aggressive but after playing a series of relatively passive moves and had she been more active then the sacrifice would have been Justified for example if the position was something like this now this is a fantastic sacrifice look it's plus three take take take because you cannot go Knight G7 cuz of Queen h78 so it all depends and it was a very nice defensive effort maybe Andrea had a little bit of a chance to complicate things if she castled Queens side she didn't see it she was probably pretty pessimistic about her position and Alexandra wins nice defensive game be very careful when you sacrifice your pieces and when you play your openings and you're getting to this 2,000 level a lot of you ask me like how do I move from intermediate to advance how do I move from advance to mastery well you got to get your London down and then in this position you should still be able to write a thesis statement on the opening the same way I explain to you while there's Bishop B5 there's Bishop D3 there's Bishop B7 there's blah blah blah blah blah this is what you have to do like you have to know all the different paths an opening can take even on move 10 this is this is chess and like these two are quite a bit stronger than like the Prototype nowadays London player who's probably like 1,200 right is looking at this like I never even get this position so an interesting battle uh the lifetime record is now one to nothing Alexandra versus Andrea and um we will see if they get paired in the tournament again I hope you enjoyed this game breakdown uh I don't do a lot of these but you know these two are two of the biggest chess influencers on the planet so I figured I would and it was an interesting battle uh and I will uh see you in the next video get out of here
