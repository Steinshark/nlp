hi everybody so as you may or may not know although most people know if they're vaguely awake um bench perro and Tom McDonald have the number one song in the world at the moment and it's very comical because it's a rap song and just the idea of bencho doing rap hip hop is comical in and of itself it's even more comical because you know he's been a Critic of that particular genre so it's very interesting to watch Ben step out of his presuppositions let's say and also his domain of previous competence although he is a musician anyways on with the analysis they call me offensive controversial it's only two genders boys and girls okay well the first thing we might point out here with regards to use of language is that Tom does use genders and I think that's actually a what would you say that's an interpretive mistake because he should have used Sexes um by using genders he fell into the Trap that the leftists have laid with regards to language utilization they're very very good at what would you occupying the linguistic terrain um there are a variety of temperaments and that's easy to get confused with gender and that's part of the reason we have the problem we have and Sexes would have worked because it's also a two- syllable word and it's a minor critique but in some ways it seems peun which means minor but it's it isn't it's more important than that because if you let your political opponents gain the linguistic territory then they win right you can't once you use their words they win so that's something for everybody to keep in mind you can't cancel my message cuz I'm the biggest independent rapper in the whole freaking world CL that I'm racist y right I'm not ashamed because I'm white if every Caucasian a bigot I guess every muslim's a terrorist every liberal is right so with regards to every Caucasian being a bigot and his claim that then therefore every Muslim is a terrorist and every liberal is Right which is you know definitely not correct direct especially if you're talking about the progressive mob the fundamental problem with the there there's a variety of fundamental problems with the woke algorithm reductive algorithm or ideology that Ben and Tom are criticizing we did research back in 2016 looking at political correct politically correct authoritarianism and and that was back when psychologists were just starting to analyze left-wing authoritarianism and we found that the best predictors of being a left-wing authoritarian were being not verbally intelligent that was a walloping predictor it was the variable most most closely associated with intelligence that I had ever seen including grades and so if you're not very bright the woke idiology is very attractive to you the second best predictor was being female the third best predictor was having a female temperament the fourth best predictor was ever having taken a course that had the woke ideology as a portion of it now we are noting all over the world now that men and women's political beliefs are segregating and so that's a reflection of the fact that this woke ideology is also a perversion of the basic female ethos it's the extension of compassion far beyond its relevant domain and it's an extension as a consequence of Pride so the women who are doing this there's men are doing it too especially those that have a more feminine temperament they're making the claim that their love is so encompassing that everything can be brought into the circle right even the snake and that's the Eternal sin of Eve by the way so so so there's a group identification claim the fundamental claim essentially is the world can be divided into victims and victimizers the victims are like infants they're always good they're always always innocent the victimizers are essentially Predators so you can see the feminine ethos in that the problem with that is when you start to apply it to groups you completely demolish the presumption of individual innocence and there's no difference between the demolition of that presumption and the imposition of a totalitarian state so now you might say there can't be that much information in those few lines but the whole point of poetry with its Reliance on imagery is to pack way more information into utterances than you could otherwise manage and so a a dense poem which is the use of words to produce images can have levels of meaning that are almost inexhaustible that's partly why we remember poetry and and poetic poetic verse let's say image Laden poetic verse will remember remember that for centuries because it's literally inexhaustible they say a picture is worth a thousand words it's like well a complex picture is worth a lot more than a thousand words and words can bring images to mind [Music] go woke go broke you know it's a nice rhyme but there's something there too and what Tom is pointing to is that if you construe yourself as a victim and you develop no and you have an external locus of control that's the technical term from the psychology research um literature then you believe that you are nothing but a pawn of circumstances that are beyond your control and you adopt the guise of powerlessness now if you could gain a moral Advantage from that you know that's a secondary gain that's how that would be interpreted from a psychoanalytic perspective it's doing something that isn't good for you because there's a payoff and so if you construe yourself as a victimizer you only believe you're moved about by external forces you won't develop a vision of your own and that will mean that you're anxious and confused because you're being buffered around by the winds of external forces it'll mean you have no direction in your life and that makes you hopeless the combination of those two things will mean that you have no motivation and the consequence of that and we know this perfectly well because highly motivated people are much more likely to be economic economically successful the consequence of that is that you won't have any money and then of course you'll use that to buttress your claim to victim status and then you're in a loop that's the dragon that eats its own tail by the way that's a symbol of chaos and then you're basically in hell so uh I wouldn't recommend that you know as a clinical psychologist which I still am by the way so all right next line Pro Choice progressin prot okay now here's here's something else to understand so imagine that you're you know compassionate in your basic ethos so you have a more feminine temperament you're high in agreeableness now but you're also full of Pride and so you want to overclaim the utility of that and bring everything to you clutch the poisonous serpent to your breath rest as I pointed out okay so what's the problem with that well this has been modeled very well um even computationally we understand this make no mistake about that so imagine you set up a society that's full of agreeable people who do nothing but cooperate fine and they all get along and that can be extraordinarily productive as long as people keep acting in that reciprocally altruistic manner which means they treat you treat someone well and they treat you well back that can be extremely productive and that's actually the basis of a productive Society one of the basis it's not enough though because you need enforcement and that's why you need men with spines and the reason for that is that if you have a whole community of Cooperators and you drop one cheater into the mix one shark he will eat everything and so what the you can see this you see this happening for example when Seattle set up its its Progressive City it took like two weeks before it was controlled by armed gangs this exactly the same thing happened happened in Alberta recently by the way with all the tent cities so as soon as you have a a place of victimized people run by the hyper compassionate the bloody thugs move in and then you better watch yourself and if you think that's not and then of course if you're hyper if you're prideful and Hyper compassionate you're going to think oh the poor thugs they just had it rough when they were children you know and a lot of them did but I'll tell you something else about that and that is that there's a lot of people who had it rough as children who don't turn into like Psych AIC Thugs and you all you hyper compassionate people who are out there like feeling sorry for the criminals you wait till they show up in your bloody house you'll be thinking twice about that and we've seen no shortage of that on the victimized liberal side people who get mugged out in the street after they defund the police and short circuit because oh my god look I got attacked it's like yeah well you enabled the Psychopaths and I wouldn't recommend that so that's what happens compassion defund the police no protection rule by psychopath yeah I wouldn't recommend that where the American flags at remember when people would hang those they've been taken down they all been replaced with BLM Flags or a rainbow okay so flag the flag idea man that's a complicated idea so the idea of a flag is something like the idea of a staff and a staff well you have a staff if you run a business and the staff is something you rely on a staff is something that supports you a staff is something that moves you forward a staff is something that helps you find your way a a flag is a staff with a banner and so the banner is something around which everyone can unite a flag is a uniting symbol okay so what's a rainbow flag well let's think about it it's a flag of division literally because a rainbow is the division of a Unity what's white into a plurality what's a rainbow and you can't have a Unity of plurality well you can in a world where a man can be a woman you can have a Unity of plurality and I'll tell you that's the reign of utter chaos now we already pointed out that the reign of utter chaos brings in the psychopath the true oppressors the real victimizers and so and it this pride flag what what would you say um waving this Proclamation this praying in the streets this this false moralizing is a way of once again proclaiming to the world that your compassion is so overwhelming and inclusive that you can love the whole world you know and that's fine except for the snakes and you know you can imagine why women do that because in some ways they want to advertise to men that they're going to be good Mothers you know and that is what they're doing even if they don't know it and then you might ask well why would men do it and I'll tell you what sort of men do that the sort of men who do that have no masculine utility whatsoever and so they ape feminine utility they act like girls that's a good way of thinking about it then they can be a friend well hopefully a friend with sexual benefits right and so loser men use false compassion pridefully as a way of attracting stupid women and they're particularly good at doing that if they're Psychopathic and the data on that are very clear because young women especially naive young women are much more likely to be sexually victimized by Psychopaths and narcissists and you might ask well how will the Psychopaths and narcissists close themselves and the answer is that they're not going to come out with shark teeth on man because then you know who they were they're going to tell you how nice they are how lovely they are and how they care for everything in the world it's like you better take that with a grain of salt cuz if you don't you're going to pay for it so we'll get back to that to that particular Motif as we progress we ain't selling drugs we ain't going to overdose we ain't pushing guns and promoting stripper POS we won't turn your sons into thugs or your daughters into okay Sons into Thugs and your daughters into hoes yeah that's a great juxtaposition all of that so the first thing Tom is doing is singing about Hedonism right and that's the pursuit of say easy sex and and materialist markers of localized success right and so then you might say well what sort of people pursue short-term mating strategies because that's the technical biological definition who are looking for easy sex one night stands and who parade around their shallow materialism and the answer is we already talked about these people we know this short-term mating preference is associated with the dark tetrad narcissism so that's the desire for unearned social status melanism so that's the willingness to use manipulation to get what you want psychopathy so the worst criminals are psychopaths by the way psychopaths are predatory parasites that's a bad combination now first of all those were the only three traits that were studied but that didn't work out very well because it turned out there there was a missing variable and that was sadism so if you're a psychopathic narcissist mellian you also end up wanting to hurt other people for your own pleasure and those are the people who are engaging in the hedonistic strategy right short-term pleasure you see this and they're the ones that'll enslave you you see this in the in the Disney movie Pinocchio it's beautifully portrayed because the little thugs Pinocchio Falls in with the bad crowd little thugs um LED by lampwick by the way and lampwick is a reference to Lucifer and Lucifer is the prideful intellect by the way and so Pinocchio who's trying to become real follows lampwick and The Coachman who's like Satan himself to Pleasure Island where they do things like desecrate classic works of art we've seen plenty of that lately and they turn into braying jackasses who are then enslaved by dark Forces operating behind the scenes you remember that go watch that that section of the movie and see if you can figure out what the hell it means so what does it mean there's something deep here this Thug ho thing is extremely deep so I'm going to read you something um that you'll find quite interesting here so this is from The Book of Revelation and it's quite a shocking um a shocking account this is really a hallucinogenic vision and so this is the vision in Revelation 7 1718 one of the Seven Angels who had the seven bowls came and said to me come I will show you you the judgment on the great prostitute who sits on many Waters okay so the great prostitute is the mother of all prostitutes right so it's disinhibited it's the essence of disinhibited female sexuality and what does it mean that it sits on many Waters well water in the biblical account is a symbol of chaos and so the underneath disinhibited female sexuality is chaos itself right the chaos that devours everything with whom the kings of the earth committed sexual immorality and Earth's inhabitants were made drunk with the wine of her sexual immorality well we can see the emergence of the of Babylon because that's what that is Babylon being the great state by the way we can see that emergence in the technological transformation of women into what would you say um succubi and incubi that's a very good way of thinking about it right so sexually attractive apparitions that take everyone's Vitality so that's real fun the the account continues and he carried me away in the power of the spirit into a Wilderness and I saw a woman the same woman the the of Babylon sitting on a Scarlet colored wild beast so that's blood colored essentially that was full of Blasphemous names and that had seven heads and 10 horns okay so this is the Beast of the state and the multiplicity of heads that's what occurs when the state no longer has its Unity so you could associate that for example with the with the pride flag the rainbow idea the notion that diversity can be be a Unity it's the collapse of a Unity as a consequence of the death of God into the Beast of the state okay so what rides on the Beast of the state the idiot Hedonism that power mad tyrants entice you with to turn you into slaves right now this hallucinogenic account is a image Laden imaginative description of how societies collapse as such so how they collapse in eternity so the woman was clothed in purple and Scarlet and she was adorned with gold and precious stones and Pearls so she's beautiful and attractive and looks valuable and that's her cover story and she had her hand in her hand a golden cup same sort of thing a golden cup is generally the container of the redeeming fluid let's say the redeeming liquid the Water of Life the blood of Christ and so this is a an inversion of that it's it's uh the golden cup that was full of disgusting things and the unclean things of her sexual immorality so that's pretty damn rough image you might say and that's what she's offering the world to drink great on her forehead was written the name a mystery a mystery Babylon the great the mother of the prostitutes and of the disgusting things of the earth okay well that's fun now I wrote a whole article about that called identity individual and the state versus the subsidiary hierarchy of Heaven I wrote that for for the alliance for responsible citizenship with Jonathan Paso where we took apart this particular imagery so what happens in the Revelation story is the the of Babylon sits on the degenerate beast of the state offering everyone hedonic Delights allied with power and the Beast eventually kills the and so what does that mean it means the bloody tyrants will offer you everything you want you can have it right now just like the half wit dim wits in Pinocchio's Treasure Island but eventually they will take everything like that from you and you can see that already not least in the fact that young people are becoming sexually sated and and overflowing in a manner that's actually stopping them from forming relationships stopping them from getting married stopping them from being with one another staying virginal like the the end result of hedonic Lous and this is what Tom is pointing to the end result of that is that nobody ever gets anything pleasurable at all right so I wouldn't recommend that either so let continue I don't if iend I was put to okay so let's think about offense for a minute okay so here's why you have ideas now you have ideas so you can Orient yourself in the world in abstraction now you might want to think something through before you do it because if the thing you want to do is stupid and you think it through and you understand that you will come to a Bitter End if you pursue that course then you can kill that idea now maybe you're kind of fond of that idea and you've invested a lot in it so there's going to be some godamn pain when you kill your own stupid ideas and that'll make you offensive to yourself now maybe you can offer those ideas to other people you know and you you offer them you say what do you think of this and they go after you hard and they kill the idea well of course that's going to hurt your feelings because it's part of you that's dying but it's a stupid part that doesn't mean there's not going to be any pain associated with it and so this is it's often the people who oppose your ideas most dreadfully who are in some sense the force that keeps your stupidity in check now that's not always the case but it's frequently the case and so what this means you have to understand what this means is there's no genuine critical thought without hurt feelings do you understand that no critical thought without hurt feelings okay then so then you say well we'll dispense with critical thought because we don't want anybody's feelings to be hurt then then they wander off a cliff and die and so that's not a good substitute we evolve thinking so our stupid thoughts could die instead of us now the death of a thought is still something that's associated with a certain degree of emotional disregulation because the chaos that that thought constrained is released when that thought dies and the Future Vision that was associated with that thought disappears as well and so there's a certain amount of dissolution of Hope but it's better to have your stupid thought die than for you to suffer directly physically or even die and so if we inst Institute a rule that critically minded people so those would be disagreeable people the same people you rely on by the way if you're compassionate to protect you from the you know the idiot Hedon hedonistic thugs if you forbid people's ability to speak in a manner that some especially the prideful victimizers regard as offensive that's no different than stopping them from being able to think critically and you know thought has three components you you know you ask a question you receive an answer but then you have to evaluate the answer and you evaluate the answer with critical thinking and in so far as you do that you're going to cause emotional distress you're going to be offensive so now when Ben the entire song rotates around the notion of facts and facts versus feelings well feelings can Orient you in the world right they give us a first pass low resolution quick Instinct Laden manner of evaluating the world literally evaluating it telling the difference between what's good and what's not but we've Allied that with a much more differentiated communication system that enables us to build a representation of something approximating the objective world and what we generally do is we refine our emotional commitments with the facts that we gather around us because we could be led astray by our instant Instinct so for example the Instinct of a compassionate woman is going to be to feel sorry for like everything and everyone and fair enough you know because there's lots of misery in the world and there are true infants and there are children that need to be taken care of and there are old people and there are sick people it's like so I would say to women it's like go out and find someone that actually needs to be taken care of that would take some work have a child for example instead of inventing victims so that you could pretend to be female and so that's exactly what's going on here so all right continue you can cry you can scream you can ride in the street okay there we go all right so here's another way that feelings can be perverted by the narcissistic now if you cry that's a distress cry and you're you're you're showing that you're dissolving you're dissolving in the salt water of tears and what's dissolving is your adaptive stability right you can't handle it you can't manage that's why you cry you're overwhelmed and the cry signifies that the tears and the lack of ability to speak because you can't speak when you're when you're really sobbing it's a distress cry that's sent out to the world to gather attention and resources okay now if you're a child and you're crying because you're I don't know you have a diaper pin stuck in you to use a example from like 60 years ago you know you're too hot or you're too cold and all you can do is lay there so what you got you can cry you know and that brings attention to you and then care and now attention is a very valuable resource okay so what does that mean it means pain cries can be gamed by narcissistic Psychopaths that's what it means and so we know this because obviously the worst people are going to guise themselves in the highest form of moral virtue that's the essence of hypocrisy and so if you're a whiny crying victim and you attract attention in consequence well then you're gaming the system that was used that was that was cobbled together as a consequence of a lengthy evolutionary process to ensure the care of dependent infants you're mimicking that you know and that's that's a what what that's a terrible form of theft you're taking from the people who are genuinely in need and you're deflecting all that attention to yourself and why are you doing that well so that you don't have to bear responsibility for your own life how's that so that you can sponge off on someone stupid enough to feel sorry for you and then you can wave your bloody flag of moral your your divisive flag of moral virtue out in the streets instead of like going to volunteer in a hospital to take care of sick children or having a baby for example which is where all that Superfluous maternal Instinct should most genuinely be directed we know perfectly well as I said earlier that being a a woman and being female are the second and third best predictors of being a politically correct authoritarian well how about if we made the hypothesis that that's a perversion of the maternal Instinct that isn't being utilized properly by young women between the ages of 18 and 30 who are far more likely to be Progressive than any other kind of person if we're going to like have a serious conversation about this we're always too godamn cowardly to do that so all right so that's that I what okay so Tom asked what would Ben do now this brings us to a disc discussion of personality so it's one of the things that makes this video so compelling and interesting is that Ben and Tom are quite different in personality in a subtle way um although the overt manifestations of that aren't subtle at all Tom is a crazy looking bastard you know metal teeth um tattooed to the hilt crazy hairstyle like he's quite the monster now I did a study at Harvard 30 years ago 40 years ago um with a colleague of mine I won't say her name because I don't know if she would be happy about it or not I mean we're still friends but anyways we didn't publish this study unfortunately but this study was done just when piercing and tattooing entered the mainstream and it was starting to become a fad um a contagious fad and so we were interested because we were both personality psychologists and psychopathologists in whether or not that proclivity to tattoo and to pierce was a marker of Psychopathology potential for mental illness or maladjusted personality now we thought it might be because up until that point all of that had been part of like circus subculture or prison subculture there was a there was a a a subculture that was characterized by pierces and tattooing but they were always Outsiders often The Outsiders who run am parks for example often Carneys or prisoners so the genuinely marginalized now what we found was that there was no association between that proclivity and psychopathology but that it was a marker for the fifth personality Dimension openness which is essentially openness is a openness to experience is the technical name it's a combination of imaginative creativity and aesthetic sensibility and interest in ideas and verbal fluency and that's where Tom and Ben really split they're both very very high in openness because they're very creative people and that's associated with verbal intelligence and being able to wrap is a marker of verbal intelligence and verbal fluency which is associated with articulate with the ability to articulate and that in turn is associated with a high probability of success in the world and so part of the reason that rap artists are attractive is because they're manifesting their intelligence in a creative way and that's a signal of their General utility it's a display of their intelligence now Ben and Tom do this in very different ways so you could imagine that Tom is an imaginative genius right he's the same kind of strange character let's say as Marilyn Manson and and David Bowie and and Mick Jagger and and and Russell Brand for that matter these extremely showy people who are geniuses of imaginative Association right and so they're working at the level of the dream they're they're in the image domain and now they can translate that into words to some degree as well and and that makes them poet so a poet is an intermediary between the semantic and the linguistic and the imaginative and then you can imagine that there are experts of creativity some of them are experts of imagination and some of them are experts of word and Ben is an absolute bloody master of word although he's not anywhere near as open on the aesthetic side as Tom Ben's quite a conservative person now he's very very high in conscientiousness orderliness dutifulness that goes along with patriotism and so forth he very high in that but you know he he's a very conservative looking person short haircut you know uniform suits essentially but unbelievably verbal and so that makes him a rapper it's interesting to see him working with Tom because Ben with his almost purely verbal intellect although he's interested in music you know so so it's not a un dimensional guy but he can Ally with Tom to delve into the imaginative realm and that's what they did with this with this rap video which obviously caught the spirit of the times because it's the number one song in the world at the moment which is like absolutely hilarious Beyond conception that Ben Shapiro is now you know a star rapper it's especially comical because he also criticized rap because it's excesses offended his his excesses offended his conservative temperament you know and there was some utility in that in so far as it's a culture that promotes the thug ho juxtaposition and thus the horror of Babylon and the Scarlet Beast which is not really a very good idea but you could argue on the open side that he failed to understand the cultural significance of hip hop and rap as a as a genuine expression of artistic Endeavor and creative intelligence and so but being somewhat exploratory in his nature even aesthetically he decided to go ahead with this rap song and collaborate with Tom and they look like people on the opposite End of the Universe and the collaboration produced something that was quite Stellar now you can take tremendous liberties with your imagination right so that's what creativity is tremendous liberties with imagination you can dream all sorts of insane things well why because you don't act them out when you dream you're literally paralyzed so you can't go around and act out your stupid imaginative ideas and die right and so but you experiment like mad now the problem with that broad experimentation is that a lot of it's going to be noise rather than signal a lot of it's going to be off the mark So then you might ask well how do you how do you see which of your creative ideas the plentitude of creative ideas that you've produced are off the mark and one answer is you talk to other people and you get their critical feedback but that's particularly useful when you're doing that with someone like Ben because Ben has a very very high level of verbal intelligence like it's off the charts and verbal fluency as well but he's also quite disagreeable impolite and so that means he'll tell you what he bloody well thinks and you might say Well that's pretty hard on me it's like no it's hard on your stupid ideas now if you're desperately identified with your stupid ideas then that's going to feel to you like a death you know and so and you might fight to the death to protect yourself from that happening but that's not wise because you should subject your ideas to stress test so Tom's radical imagination has Allied itself with his admiration for Ben and I don't just mean within this video obviously Tom is an admirer of Ben and the reason for that is because Tom has enough humility to subject his wild imagination to the critical evaluation of the intellect so openness to experience bifurcates into interest in ideas and interest in Aesthetics and the really wild creative artist types are high in interest in Aesthetics women are slightly higher in that by the way too whereas and they're interested in fiction for example compared to non-fiction and they're interested in people rather than things that all Stacks up on that side of the openness equation whereas the the more cutting cut and dried intellectual types like Ben they're more they're they're more um well they're less elusive in their thought processes and they're more allied with the forces that criticize thought and hone it rather than generating in it in this imaginative sense now that's a lovely playoff right because you're in a stellar position if you can have a collaboration in your own mind like the one that Tom and Ben established where you have someone who's wildly creative talking to someone who's wildly critical because then you get a plethora of ideas and you can kill all the stupid ideas off until you're left with just the like shining examples of the most brilliant ideas and then you don't die because you're stupid and imaginative and everybody benefits from your creativity so anyway so that's why Tom is turning to Ben and that's that's uh one element of the creative logos turning to the other so it's so here's another way of thinking about this so when God throws Adam and Eve out of out of paradise he sets up these cherubim they're monsters monstrous Angels terrifying and they are accompanied by this sword that's on fire that turns every Wich way so this is a sword that cuts and burns from which you cannot Escape right that's what it means to for it to turn every Wich way and you might say well why would Paradise be barred by a sword like that and by monstrous forms and the answer is well nothing stupid and weak and useless you know in the in the fundamental sense is allowed to exist in heaven that's the place where only anything that's perfect can can make its can make its entrance and so that means everything that is unworthy has to be cut and burned away and so then you can imagine too that if you were stacked to the gills with unworthy thoughts and proclivities and imaginative routines then those cherubs wielding that sword would look to you like like the Devil Himself and you're passing through that cutting process would feel like hell so critical thinking is a burning and cutting operation right it's what gets rid of the Deadwood and that's partly why we have to allow people to have free speech so that we can have these battles in abstraction so that we don't have to act out our stupid ideas and then have battles in reality right because once we lose the ability to argue abstractly we we revert to to fighting right because arguments are abstracted Wars that's what they are an argument is an abstracted War now it can be a civilized war in which it's got a g in which case it has a game-like aspect but make no mistake about it if you remove people's ability to speak freely and engage in verbal conflict something Ben is absolutely superb at then you devolve the conflict into action and you get a chaotic War right and we're on the brink of that in multiple ways so this isn't some mere abstraction that the philosophical or the literary-minded are preoccupied with because they have nothing better to do quite the contrary let's just keep it real fact don't how you feel man if you want my PRS I'm the man I'm the man who don't respect look at the stats got the my money likez my pockets are fatom I'm epic don't be a w dog yomie No Cap okay so this is this is like ridiculously funny and and Ben is ridiculously funny and he does it with his straight face and so he's pointing to something here too which is that he has a long-term orientation as a conscientious person right so he's willing to sacrifice the hedonistic pleasures of the of the present to the Future he's got a long-term Vision that's also what makes him not a short-term Mater not a psychopath not a narcissist not a maavalan not a sadist he sacrifices in the present to gather good things in the future that's one of the things that makes him a reliable husband and a reliable provider for children and what he's trying to point out to the people who are listening in his tongue and cheek Manner and quite comically is that you know you can pursue hes and cars and flashy gold and live in the moment like a overgrown three-year-old or even a 2-year-old or you can learn how to make the proper sacrifices and you can grow the hell up and you can have an eye to the longer term which is exactly what happens once you start to care for children and then what the wealth that is genuine wealth starts to acre to you plus plus you don't get killed and you know gunned down in a gang fight when you're like 22 so so so all of that's happening in the verses that he's laying out in his you know very straight-faced straight laced witty manner I love his I love his Thug hoodie too that's like good work Ben that's extreme I saw someone yesterday they called him little shop L shop I thought that was great I think everyone should call Ben Shapiro little shop for the rest of his life look at the graphs look at my charts you're blowing money on strippers and cars you go into prison I'm on televisions no one knows who you are okay so there you know so the other thing Ben's pointing to there is well prison and death that's not great that's not a great outcome you know uh and and then he's also pointing out too something we know to be a fact so about three to five% of people have a psychopathic narcissistic tilt that's significant enough to be clinically relevant so that's you know one person out of 20 or 30 what that shows is it's not that it's not a particularly successful strategy you could think about it as a niche strategy you know you can survive and propagate to some degree if you're a psychopathic exploiter but it's not a good strategy partly because people catch on partly because you can't cooperate with other people because once you screwed them once or twice so to speak they're not going to have anything to do with you how we know this so Psychopaths betray everyone else but they also betray their futur s and that's why they end up in prison and you might say Well they're doing this to gain attention and Ben's point is well whatever attention you gain is going to be pretty damn fleeting you know it's not going to last and plus it's not real it's based completely it's based on a tissue of maav alion and manipulative lies it's not a good strategy now it's complicated because a lot of these tough guys who use these short-term mating strategies and power you know they are in some ways more courageous than the absolutely useless weasels who do nothing but remain dependent for their entire life and that's partly what it accounts for the attraction of the Shadow you know shadow figures dark figures dark heroes anti-heroes in movies and so on you know the the ability to integrate that aggression is a developmental milestone you know a boy who's too dependent has to integrate his aggression so that he can push his mother away even aggressively and move into the world right so the aggression has its place you can't you can't dispense with it you can't like surgically excise toxic masculinity or the testicles that give rise to it which we seem to be doing to a radical degree in our society it has to be integrated it's everything in its right place right everything in its proper order everything properly subdued and set where it's supposed to be in the proper Heavenly hierarchy that's Adam's job by the way that's the job that God gives him in the Garden of Eden right to name everything to speak properly and to put everything in its proper place and that's what the Tom and banner are trying to do in this video you know in this artistic way and that is what everyone who's listening to it is trying to do even if they don't know it okay parents Nikki Tak some notes I just did this for fun all my people download this let's get a billboard number one I don't care if I offend you I was put here to upset you you can crying you can scream you can ride in the street you defunded the police now there's no one to protect you out by you I ask myself what let's just keep it real facts don't care how Okay so so let's look at that for a minute I'm the man who don't respect you okay so imagine women have this problem with with men right because they they have to evaluate men to see to distinguish the genuine providers the genuinely productive and generous men and hopefully a man with a spine from the psychopathic narcissists who act like that but aren't the real thing right and we know that younger women have a more difficult time with that than older women because they don't have the experience now men have an analogous problem which is how to differentiate between the women who pretend to be compassionate and caring and therefore productive and generous and who do that to elevate their femininity and their moral status and women who would actually commit let's say to a long-term relationship and to the care of actually dependent people which is very hard it's very hard to care for infants it's very hard to care for sick old people right and that's a lot more difficult and parading around your compassion like a false flag and so when Tom says that he's the man who I'm the man who don't respect you what he means by that is that he has developed the perspicacity the Acuity of vision to distinguish between people who are truly compassionate and so that would be the genuine mothers of the world or those with a genuine and maternal impulse and those who are just parading this false flag to look good for their friends and for every for anybody who's foolish enough to be entranced by their their claim so all right let's [Music] continue VI I'm be the man oh yes so I'm going to be the man so what is Tom saying it's like well he's being called upon to be a compassionate Ally and he has enough sanity to distinguish between false and true compassion and he's decided that even if he has to suffer the slings and arrows of Outrageous Fortune he's going to be a tough guy and he's going to say what the hell he has to say and let the and let and let the and let the chips fall where they're going to fall now I would say also for you men that are listening that's also something that makes men truly attractive to women who are actually Discerning right that capacity to stand up against the mob the Psychopaths and to differentiate between genuine andal false compassion and you really need to do that as a father you know you learn this when you have little kids is that you have a finite amount of energy and you want to devote it to the care of those who are truly in need that'll be your parents at some point it'll be your wife at some point you as well because everybody gets sick and old and but even more importantly it's your children you don't want to waste that energy on the false cries of the um what would you call the falsely oppressed and we're being called upon to do that non-stop that's really right at the core the culture wars and all that's being pointed to in this video that's why it's a number one video you know it's not just it's a joke you know but it's a joke that hits the target a joke doesn't become that popular unless it hits the target you you you you just try to get attention being triggered all you have you mad you mad you mad you blame everybody else for every problem you can yeah okay so there Tom talks about being triggered and getting attention that way so that's that false cry and then he moves into the next part of this song which is a discussion of Madness let's say you mad okay well there mad has two meanings right you're angry and bitter and resentful like Cain who ends up killing his Idol his ideal Abel so you're mad you're angry you're bitter and resentful bitterness and resentment man those poison your soul that plus arrogance and deceit and you're definitely in hell and then mad is also insane and if you pursue these shortterm strategies of Hedonism and power and chaotic divisiveness there's no difference between that and Insanity so the madness goes two ways and of course as you descend into madness you're going to become more angry and destructive and then you get another Vicious Circle going so yeah that's not good it's guess it's cool to be the victim well if that's all you've got you know when Tom said he's not going to be the victim and that you know one of the things that you learn in the story of Job for example example so job is terribly tortured by God terribly he loses everything and becomes extremely ill and he refuses to play victim as a matter of Faith it's a proclamation everybody has a reason to construe themselves as a victim life is very very difficult and unfair things happen to people all the time so do you play the victim well playing the victim is the Eternal Pathway to Hell fundamentally especially when you also then start to identify the victimizer because if you're a victim and you're innocent then the victimizer is the perpetrator and the ultimate perpetrator is no is nothing else conceptually than Satan himself and so once you've placed Satan himself in the midst of a group let's say the Jews then there's absolutely nothing that bars your action and so then you can have all that resentment and anger and Madness it Finds Its Target you wonder why the Nazis went after the Jews it's the Eternal story you put Satan it's himself right the victimizer in the midst of an ethnic group which is like the definition of racism and and you play this game that all the virtues on the side of the poor innocent victims as if they're innocent babies and they're not and all the perpetration is on the side of the of the of the victimizers and then you can add another twist to that isn't it so lovely that if you're unsuccessful you can identify the successful with the victimizers because then you can attribute your fa failure to your own moral virtue what a good deal for you if you really want to be insane and angry and then it's pretty hard on the people who've been successful isn't it because now you've identified them with evil itself now if you take the most successful people in your culture and I mean the most genuinely productive and generous and you start to identify them with evil itself how the hell long do you think your culture is going to last think about that because it's it's not that many people who are hyperproductive and generous and if you take them out you're done and if you don't believe that you go read about what happened in the Soviet Union in the 1920s and see what you conclude or in MA China and you'll see exactly how that plays out and you might think if you're a bitter resentful angry mad sad victim well it's worth it because the whole goddamn system is so corrupt it should be burned just burned to the ground it's like fair enough you know but you'll be one of the people who's thrown by your carnivorous allies onto the fire first along with everyone you love and I wouldn't recommend [Music] that I never I'm I ain't I don't care if I offend you I was put here to say you you can crying you can scream you can ride in the streets you defunded the police now there's no one to protect you I hope I offend you I as myself what we been do let's just keep it real facts don't get how you feel man if you want my pronouns I'm the man I'm the man who don't respect you okay so there's one other thing I'll point to and we'll we'll we'll draw this to a close let's just keep it real the the postmodern ethos that's allied with neomarxism this insistence in a victimizer victim dichotomy is also allied with a a a a philosophical claim and the philosophical claim is that meaning itself is only cultur and that it's also only instantiated in language and if you accept that well then you can you can play the game of assuming that gender for example is nothing but a cultural construct and that people can be anything they say they are because you're making the claim that the world is the world's reality is instantiated entirely in the semantic or the linguistic it's the ultimate pretension of the luciferian intellect it's a good way of thinking about it when Tom says let's just keep it real what he's pointing to is the existence of levels of reality underneath the purely linguistic and so one of those would be as the bloody postmodern whining nihilists have it themselves is well there's a reality in the emotional sphere right there's the reality of feelings now they're not the only reality obviously obviously there's the reality of material fact there's the reality of transpersonal value there's a lot of different Transcendent realities and hypothetically this is the monotheistic claim hypothetically all of those Transcendent realities unite in a single superordinate reality and if that's not the case then we're bound to divisiveness so all right so let's sum this up you have a collaboration between two types of Creator in this video who are analyzing using poetic imagery the core elements of the culture War that's engulfed us way down below the political right at the level of the Sacred and they're using a blend of humor and creative imagery to lay out the conceptual territory and they're using music to help people music and Rhythm to help people attune themselves to the argument and allying that with a with a high degree of of wit and and and and a satirical intent and so it's very masterfully done and Ben you know I think in particular Ben is to be commanded here for allowing himself to enter the domain of the Absurd now he's got an absurdist side it's interesting to see because he's a very straight laac person and a very conservative person uh not least as a consequence of being an orthodox Jew but he has this absurdist capability that that allows him to capitalize on the entertaining side of things and so that's very interesting to see manifested in this so anyways you never know what's going on beneath the surface do you right right there's endless depths to everything that's for sure everything is a burning bush right everything's a gateway to the sacred if you pay attention to it enough and that's definitely the case with with cultural Productions of this sort especially when they strike a cord and so that's why I thought it might be worth running through an analysis of this Preposterous piece of artistic production thanks very much for your time and [Music] attention [Music]
