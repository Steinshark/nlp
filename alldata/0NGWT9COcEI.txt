- I have five debit cards, each with a $20,000 limit.
(cash register dings) What's five times 20? (modem connecting) - Ten.
- Exactly. (knocking on door)
(intense booming) - FBI, open up! - [MrBeast] We have a
hundred thousand dollars in credit cards right here. You have 24 hours to
spend the hundred grand. - Hundred thousand. Let's go guys, let's go!
(intense rock music) - [MrBeast] Wait, wait, I need to film it. They've experienced two
of these challenges. They will guide you today. - First things first, let me hold these. (shrill noise) - Good.
- Wow, great. - [MrBeast] Chandler
would literally run away. - He passed the test. (upbeat jazzy music) - [MrBeast] We are going in to Best Buy. Good luck, brother. Alright, CJ, you just bought a 32 inch TV. That's it? You have 100 grand.
- I know, I know. - Buy this, it's anime. - Oh, it's a good one.
- Yes, that's a great show. Yes.
- Alright. - He's so distracted right now. He doesn't know what to do. Here, you want binoculars? - Yeah. - [MrBeast] Why do you need binoculars? - When I watch your YouTube videos, so I can understand 'em more. So I can fully see everything. - So a lot of these purchases
might not make sense, but this guy right here is
making a YouTube channel, so a lot of this stuff he's
buying is for his channel. We'll tell you more about that later. Alright, keep going. - Speakers for your editing computer. - Oh, definitely. - Wow, this one's two grand.
- This one's 22 grand. - [MrBeast] It's so cheap! I'm just kidding. (laughing) CJ, you're a YouTuber now. You got stacks. - [CJ] Okay, I'll take both. - [MrBeast] You are a YouTuber, but you don't have any revenue yet. (intense grinding) - Here, somebody get me that one so I can go to the next person. - [MrBeast] You go over there. I'm gonna veto that. Just get him that one. - Okay. - [MrBeast] Are you buying this desktop for your editor?
- Yes. - [MrBeast] This is his first partner, and then he has two editors, and he has another guy to help him set up. I set my brother up good. - All my employees can
have the same phone, and so I can call them,
and they'll answer. - That is helpful, yes.
- I appreciate it. - Technology! - [MrBeast] Here's your iPhones. - Okay. - [MrBeast] So five iPhones. Wait, Chris, did you boss
buy you guys all iPhones? - Bought me a Google Pixel one time. - [MrBeast] Good enough! Chandler, did your boss buy you an iPhone? - No, look.
(glass shatters) (both laugh) - Hey that's a $600
printer, you realize that. - I'm getting a bunch of gifts. - Why does it feel like this is expensive? - That's $300.
- Yeah. - Wait, they have an $1100 one. They have a $1300 robot. - Bitch, this is my money,
not your money, okay? - [MrBeast] Bro with the sass. - I'm gonna hit him with Gucci shoes. The ultimate disrespect.
(both laughing) (Chandler grunts) - [MrBeast] What is going on? - I'm excited for CJ. - I will take four of the Hero7 Black. Alright, I'll take the silver one too. - [MrBeast] Chandler,
how much have we spent? (machine grinding) - $32,000. - [MrBeast] Well, the viewers
have a number right here. We have no idea. - I do need a calculator, though. So I can calculate how
much money I give away. - [Chandler] Sick. (laughing) - Chandler, I forgot my Xbox. - My soda! - Can I take this? - [MrBeast] I don't think it's an Xbox. It's just a poster. - Oh, shoot. - [MrBeast] Xbox One. Boom.
- No way. - Pinata.
- Pinata. I got a surprise for you. Here you go. - Thank you. What are you, Ninja? I would never throw it at you. (glass shatters)
(transmission squelches) - We just forgot the most important thing. Just so I can play the part of YouTuber, I need to look like I have money. I need AirPods. (MrBeast claps once) We didn't get AirPods.
- That is actually very important. - Chris, AirPods, STAT. - So, are we coming over to your channel? - Yeah, you want to
come over to my channel? - Okay, how much? - I can give you a computer, all those toys that I bought you. - Yeah.
- I'll get you a Five Guys burger, not
a McDonald's burger. - I think we're doing
business together, CJ. - [CJ] Who's getting Twizzlers? - [Chris] The ones that are pointing. - Did you get Twizzlers? - I did. - I cannot afford this right now. (upbeat music)
(scanner beeping) - [Tyler] CJ, what was the total? - The total was $30,302.46.
(cash register dings) - Alright, so you have 30.2% done. - [Tyler] You spent an entire college tuition at Best Buy. - I should have probably
paid off my college tuition. - Chandler, we have a math question. Is $70,000 more than $15,000. (in a slowed voice) Is
$70,000 more than $15,000? - That is not bigger than 15. - Darn, CJ, you're gonna be stuck in debt. (melancholy music) (upbeat music) So, you want a car. What kind of car? - I want a truck. - Chris, where are we
going to get a truck? - East Carolina Chrysler Jeep Dodge Ram. - Okay, see you guys there. (intense dance music) We are here at the car lot, and CJ, you can buy whatever car you want. - Alright, go!
(CJ zooms away) - [MrBeast] He did just
tell himself to go. - Hey, he's leaning. - Alright, so we were trying to think. So we bought a car with dollar bills here. We bought a car with pennies. - You smashed my car. - Oh yeah, we smashed-
- You put slime in it, yeah. - We smashed his car and
bought him a new one. We smashed Ethan's car, our editor, and bought him a new one. Point is, we've bought, this is like the 10th car we've bought. - I'm thinking, like, it's a lot of money. I've never had this
money before in my life. Oh my goodness, it's so nice. Oh wait, the sticker's on that side. - Oh.
- 46? Uh, no. - [MrBeast] Testing out your car? - Yep, this is the car I'm gettin'. - So you got it?
- I'll take it. - Good deal.
(upbeat music) - This is the most important
signing of my life right now. - [MrBeast] So MrBrother? - Yeah, I'm excited about it.
- Congratulations. CJ, are you comfy? - Yes.
- Chris, are you comfy? - I'm comfy. - Tyler? - The window doesn't work. - So how do you like it, CJ? This is $26,000.
(cash register dings) - Dude, this is even more expensive than the Camaro that you bought me. - You're gonna own that
Camaro, and then this. Dude, you're building up assets. - I'm gonna be on like
one of those MTV shows. Show my cars off. (exciting music) Alright, so we're gonna
take a lunch break. Jimmy.
- Yeah? - [CJ] We've gotta go. I've still got a lot more money to spend. - We're spending your money right now. Thanks for the food, right, Chris? - Yeah, thanks man.
(wrists smack) - [CJ] Wait, I'm paying for this? - I gave you literally
all my credit cards. - [CJ] Chandler, you got us, right? (crickets chirping) - So we just ate a big meal. You know what that means. Big tip.
(majestic music) How much is it? - $750. - But the meal was only $200. Why on Earth would you
ever leave a $500 tip? - 'Cause duh, we don't like money. (money explodes) (people chattering)
(rock music) - Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh! - I can't believe y'all did that. - Oh man.
- Hey. Well thank you so much
for the great service. - Thank you guys!
- Of course. - Thank you so much. - [MrBeast] This was
actually not from MrBeast, it was from MrBro, his brother. Starting a new YouTube channel, and he's gonna be doing this as well. - Dude, thank you! I have an eight year old little girl, and she's such a huge
fan of y'all's channel. She's not gonna believe this.
- Amazing. Amazing, well congratulations.
(cash register dings) - Thank you so much!
- Yeah, thank you. So next on CJ's list
(upbeat music) is he needs some cameras. - Hey, I forgot to buy
cameras at Best Buy, so.
- It's all good. So here we are at a camera store. Should he just use our
big time lapse cameras that we use during these long challenges, or if he should buy his own? It's your decision. - [Tyler] What's your decision? - My decision is, I buy my own. - Oh.
- Let's see, I'm also gonna get a tripod. Let's get this. Alright Chris, so I'm just grabbing like random stuff right now. Am I doing good? - [Chris] No.
(modem beeps) - I'm getting this, guys. - Let's go over here to these batteries. - Oh, it's these.
- These are regular- Not those batteries.
- Oh. - [MrBeast] Here, pick out your bag, CJ. - I want this one. - I wanna get you this one. - Why? A whole backpack.
- You could put literally all the cameras
you just bought in there. - Alright, so I'm gonna
grab all these SD cards, so I can make fire content for y'all.
(horns blaring) - You got a lot of people relying on you. You've spent a lot of money. - I know.
- Just don't fail. Or, it'll be really bad. - You have five helpers, a warehouse, office space.
- Uh huh. - You got $100,000 starting budget. - Two pennies. - We're doing your thumbnails for you. And we're helping you think of content. - Aren't you editing, too? - I'm shouting you out, and giving you over a million subscribers.
- Multiple times. - Literally all you
have to do is not suck, and you should be fine. This is like literally, CJ,
(all laughing) here's everything. Just here you go.
- Okay. - Just threw it at him. (upbeat music)
(cash register dings) - Next place is Lowe's. - [MrBeast] We just pulled in to Lowe's. I don't know what we're gonna get here, but probably a lot of supplies. Extension cables, we never
have enough extension cables. He actually has some employees and rentals that I'm currently paying for. So if you don't go watch his videos, I'm gonna have to keep paying for him. Go watch his videos, my friends. So we only have two debit cards left. Buy what you want.
- Alright, let's go. Windows. Oh wait, I do need a clock. - [Man Voice] Bruh. - Alright, so we're at the tools section. This is the most important part. If I don't have this equipment, I can't make y'all good content. I'm gonna wear protection. - Good, 'cause I don't know
if you have insurance yet. - This is a little table saw, so I can go like this
with the wood, and cut it. It's kind of a heavy box, ooh. I got this. (grunting) - Is anyone gonna help with this? - I can't get this. Alright, so I'm gonna get a lot of drills. Just so I can work on some things. Get some hammers, 'cause it's hammer time. (hammers clink)
(CJ giggles) - So we broke off from CJ, 'cause he was taking too long, so we're gonna help him buy things. - Let's go look at some carpets! (MrBeast laughs) I'm gonna try this out. - Why are you like this? - Alright he said roll him up! (all laughing) - Can we buy this now
just because of this? Nothing to see here, don't worry. - Chandler's in the rug.
- Alright, let's set it back down.
- Before we kill him. - Put him back up here. - I just got sick in there.
(laughing) My worst fears came to life. Thought I was buried alive. - We are on a Jimmy hunt.
- We need a Jimmy hunt cam, right here, boys. - Jimmy hunt. - [Both] Do do do do do do do do do do do. - [Tyler] Guys, we found Jimmy. That's Jimmy. - We found him, boys. Hunt over. - We went on a Jimmy hunt. We figured you'd be in the woods. - Tyler, heads up. (smacks head)
(intense buzz) - Ow! - [MrBeast] Heads up. - Alright, it was funny the first time. - [MrBeast] Dude that
would have been buckets if it missed your-
(boxes thudding) I'm gonna stop when you make me stop. (items thudding) Jake, quit drying the floor. (upbeat music) Go ahead. - Who?
- Yeah, you're good. You're good.
- I appreciate it. - [MrBeast] Yeah. - So we accidentally
bought all your stuff, 'cause it mixed in with ours. - I sure do appreciate it. Thank you, thank you MrBeast! (electronic music)
(cash register dings) - Alright brothers, we just finished at Lowe's, and now we're going to Staples. We still have like 18 hours left, and I think he only has like 15 grand, so he's good, he's gonna manage. - That printer looks like
a small child in his hands. This is me holding this printer. That's Shaquille O'Neal. That's insane. (intense buzz)
(Shaq shushes) - I want it. (chair squeaking) - [MrBeast] You want that chair? Right in the basket. - [Chris] Looking at
me, like I don't know. - I don't know many I actually need. - Well, (indistinct). - I'll take four. - Alright.
(machine beeping) - Total came out to 2098.03. - $2,098.03.
(upbeat music resumes) - Gonna put all this
stuff in Chris' truck. (music resumes)
(cash register dings) Chandler.
- What? - Keep CJ blindfolded for his surprise. - Alright. - [Tyler] CJ's just walking by himself. - [CJ] Guys.
- Hey Tyler. - Come on, CJ, come on, come on. And... Oop! - Ow.
(laughing) - I don't wanna kill him. You take it off. - Voila!
- Voila! - Oh! - It's your own mini warehouse to film all your challenges.
- Is it? - You can torture your friends here, you can torture yourself here. You can torture people who
aren't your friends here. He's seen this place before, but we're acting like it's new on camera. - Whoa, what? - Yeah, this is the warehouse we gave him to film all his videos. Go watch it so we can afford to pay rent. - Thank you so much, Jimmy.
- MrBrother. - Alright, I'm taking it back now. (all laughing) (electronic music) So boys, we got 13 grand. Also, Zac, Chandler's brother, is actually my brother's other partner. - Hey Zac.
- Yes. - On my channel, we have
Chris, Chandler, and me. On their channel, they have my brother, Chandler's brother, and Tyler, which is Chris' brother. We're trying to get him
adopted by Chris' family. It's literally my squad's
brothers is his channel. - I see what you did there. I heard you say it was brother. - SF5.
- Sony SF5. - SF5. - So you only have $8,200 left. - I need a PS 4. - Hey no, we need a trailer. - Oh yeah, yeah.
- Oh yeah. - Oh yeah, we need a trailer. - It has two wheels. It can hold 15,000 pounds. - That's 1,500, close.
(laughing) - How do they know that? - 1,500. Steel, 100% steel. Let's do it.
(Chandler crunches) - I bet they'll be-
- Chandler, eat later! - Oh no, we'll buy two.
- Let's join. - Three.
- Raise your hand if you're all for it. You're not part of his team. - Oh. - You have $5,500 left. Let's try to get his business
rolling and profitable. - Yeah, so I need a PlayStation. - For giveaways, yes, alright. Five PlayStations.
(cash register dings) - Let's do five.
- Alright, five, five. - From the bottom of our trio's heart, we want you to go
subscribe to our brothers, and watch every single
one of their videos. It is your sworn duty when they upload, to click on it and watch
