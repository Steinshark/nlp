- Anything you fit in this triangle. I'll pay for. - Bet, let's go! I think I wanna start right here, bro. - [MrBeast] You're
starting off with the TV. Where are you gonna put it? - [Adam] Yeah, we can put
this right on the line. - [MrBeast] Oh my gosh. I just realized how big this triangle is. You want another TV? - [Adam] I'll take two, bro. You gotta double up,
(dramatic note) you gotta-
- [MrBeast] Oh, Tareq, Tareq! - [Adam] What are you doing? - [MrBeast] Tareq, you do realize, if this touches the red line, he loses it? You almost just made him lose. - [Adam] Do you hate me, Tareq? - [Chris] What if we use those big TVs and then you can put other
things on top of them. - [MrBeast] Adam, you can walk away with a million dollars. Don't let Chris screw you. (high-pitched alarm) - [Chandler] I thought
that was the bathroom. - [Chris] You gotta stand it up. - [Adam] You gotta stand it up. One, two, (groans) - [Karl] Go, go. - [Chris] TV's in. - [MrBeast] We need to
start going over with it. - [Karl] Lift your side up a little bit. - [Adam] Okay. We're good. - [Karl] There you go. Slowly.
- Yes. - [Chris] There we go, there we go. - [Adam] (screaming) Yes! - [MrBeast] We have
now created a TV table. - [Adam] Guys, we can get that 85 inch on top of this one and
make a double table. - [MrBeast] So you guys
wanna do another TV table on this TV? - [Adam] Absolutely. - [MrBeast] There is zero chance this is happening. (upbeat music) Oh, oh, oh
(startled sound effect) You almost touched it. Watch out, man. (duck quack)
All right. - [Adam] One, two, three. (sounds of effort) - [Chris] All right, Chandler, hold up. (varied noises and instruction) - [Adam] Slowly, guys, slowly.
- No way. - [MrBeast] There's no
way this just worked. - [Adam] (screaming) Let's go! (varied exclamations) (punching sound effects) (upbeat music) - [MrBeast] These boxes
are starting to bow. Something's bound to go wrong, man. - [Adam] I think we're good right here. - [MrBeast] Okay. Never in a million years when I laid down this triangle did I think he fit this much stuff. Adam managed to fit over
$23,000 worth of stuff in this triangle, which is only a fraction of what other people
later in this video won. It gets crazy. This is a parking lot. Just kidding. It's a giant red triangle and anything you fit in this triangle, I'll pay for. Follow me. I'm pretty sure you could fit this entire Sam's Club in that triangle if you wanted. - [Darren] I'm gonna try. - [MrBeast] The reason why Darren has such a big triangle outside is he actually runs my food pantry. Boom. Cart number one. Cart number two. (explosion)
Oh, dropped your pistachios. Cart number three. We maybe filled up half a percent of the triangle. Darren, grab as much as you want. We're gonna head out. Now we're inside a GameStop and if you can fit the entire store in this triangle, I'll pay for it. - What the heck? - [Guest's Friend] I think
it'd be pretty easy, actually. - If you're with me, - Uh-huh.
- we can do anything. - [Guest's Friend] We're
gonna move it all over there and then we're gonna plan it. - [Zealous] Wait, wait, wait. We can't put it in the circle yet. - [Both] It's a triangle. - [Zealous] I never passed geometry. (dramatic music) - [MrBeast] Chandler wants to- - [Karl] (screaming) No! (slower and deeper) No! (slowed clattering) No! - [MrBeast] If anything
hits the edge, they lose. - [Chandler] How did you do that? - [Zealous] Karl, it's okay, bro. - [MrBeast] Zealous, come here, buddy. - Wait, actually? - I'm gonna need you to leave. - All right, see you guys. Bye. I love you guys. - [Karl] I'm so sorry.
- It's okay! - This time we brought two people. Have at it, boys. - [Patrick] Is the shelf for sale? The shelf could hold all of the small, loose items. - [Dave] Oh. - [MrBeast] These guys were so serious about winning that they
used a tape measure to measure the dimensions of the triangle and then measure the
dimensions of the boxes so they could perfectly fit them in. - [Patrick] We are
almost outta space here. Bring me three more games. - [Dave] We need to move
some of these things over to this side. - What do you think the
configuration should be? (cheerful music) - We build a perimeter. - Side by side vertically - and then set one on top. (dramatic music) - [Patrick We have crossed the line. I'm gonna put it down. (dramatic music) - You put these large boxes, you filled it to the brim in the middle, and you still have over
half the store left. Where do you go from here? - Up. (dramatic music) - This is possibly the craziest thing I've ever seen in my life. And the funny part is they still have a lot of stuff left. - [Patrick] Do we just
keep going up from here? - [Dave] There's nowhere else to go, sir. We can't build down. - I've never liked Funko Pops but now I hate them more than ever. - [Karl] Hey, let me tell you right now, when you were coming up these Funkos right here started shaking. It did that. That's exactly what they did. - There's a lot of opportunity for everything to go wrong and I will cry. (worried exclamations) - [Dave] Oh my God. - [MrBeast] He is less than one pinky away from the triangle. - What else is there to do? (dramatic music) - This will fit, but to fit, it has to
go down on the ground and slide in and it'll touch the triangle. - So we don't put that there. - Yep. - This has gone too far. The dude's shoveling stuff in a crack in between two boxes. Guys, you got about 10 items left. - I am so stressed out right now. - I'm stressed out for them. Come on, let's just do it. - [Patrick] Ah. Okay, okay.
- No, it's... that is not straight. That is not straight at all. - [Patrick] I see what you're doing and I love it. - Could you not have made the triangle just like, a little bit bigger? - Why? We're having so much fun. (grunting)
All right. This is what we've all been waiting for. Okay.
- This is all the marbles. - Everyone's gotta let
go at the same time. Three, two, one. Everyone let go, everyone let go. No one touching it?
- No way. - Oh! Congratulations. - We did it! - [Dave] Oh my God, Oh my God! - [Tareq] Nothing is touchin' it. - We did it! - I don't know how you did it. - What did you do today? Oh, I went to work, I had some dinner. What did you do? I won a GameStop. - [MrBeast] How is this still up here? Ironically, this is my third time buying a GameStop. Triple fist bump. (explosion) You might be wondering, why is there a giant triangle in front of a car dealership? Well, as many cars as she can fit in that triangle, I'll pay for. Here's the thing, if any of these cars touch the red lines, you lose. Which is why we brought these boards to get the cars over the line. All right, you two are the board guides. - [Karl] Look good to you?
- I think so. - Karl, this is slanted. - [Nolan] What, you don't want her to win a bunch of cars? - [MrBeast] All right. As straight as you can. Okay. Oh, all right. Boom!
- [Karl] Woo! - The first car is in the triangle and it did not touch it. Shirley seemed like a really sweet lady. So me and the boys
definitely did everything we could to make sure she won. (all exclaiming) - [MrBeast] All right, keep going. - [Nolan] You can come forward. Yep. All right. (excited exclamations) - [Shirley] More cars, honey, more cars. - [Karl] Woo. - Okay.
- [Shirley] He better move. - [Karl] You're good. - Oh.
- Oh, oh, that one was close. - Oh, clean.
- Ooh, that was perfect.
- Oh, it's clean. - Right there.
- And... Yeah, okay.
- Right there? - [MrBeast] Keep comin'. - [Karl] It looks good to me. - [MrBeast] All right. - [Karl] Yeah, it does look good. - [MrBeast] All right, back wheels. Bada-boom! - [Karl] You're good. You're good. - [Nolan] You good?
- [Karl] You're good. No, you're good. You're good. - This is terrifying.
- Now you're good. You're good, you're good. You're good. - [Shirley] One more time.
- [Karl] No, you're good. - She's got close to
$100,000 in this triangle. - Woo.
- This is serious. - Yeah.
- Okay? If you make her lose, you're gonna see a grown woman cry. - And it's gonna be completely on Nolan. - Why me? - She just picked her next car and it's one of the
biggest ones on the lot. - [Karl] We gotta be careful. This one looks easy, but if we mess up, - Okay.
- It's all gone. - [Shirley] Okay, let's do this. - [Karl] Hey, don't
worry, you got this, okay? (laughter) - [Karl and Nolan] Onward! - You're good,
- Holy cow. - you're good.
- Holy cow. - [Nolan] You're good. - [Karl] Woo. - [MrBeast] Now it's just the back wheels. - [Nolan] Just the back wheels. - [Shirley] Don't scare me no more. - [Karl] Keep it comin'. Let's go. - [Shirley] Oh God. (excited exclamations) - [MrBeast] Just don't even move. You now have five cars in the triangle. Over a $100,000. - [Shirley] Okay. Are you going for another, or are you calling it here?
- No, no. I'm calling it. - Congratulations! - [Shirley] Thank you.
- What are you even gonna do with five cars? - I get any car I want? - Every single one.
- All five of these cars are yours. - [Shirley] Wait a minute.
(record scratch) - [MrBeast] I don't understand how, but she didn't realize she was getting all five cars. For whatever reason, she thought she was only getting one, even though she put five in the triangle. - Wait a minute. You said all five cars, I won? - [MrBeast] Yeah. - Oh my God. (sobbing) - [MrBeast] Oh gosh. - Oh my God. - Okay, we're just crying now. - Okay, calm down, Shirley. - [MrBeast] Moments like this are exactly why I love giving away stuff. Just watching this footage back warms my heart. - Ooh. What do I do with five cars? (laughter) I'm just (indistinct) with one. - [MrBeast] This is Dino. And if he can successfully jump out of a plane from thousands of feet in the air and land in this red triangle, I'll give him $20,000. And because I know Tareq
is afraid of heights, I offered him $20,000 to go up there and skydive as well. - Face those fears, Tareq. - Unless you hate him. (laughing) - Okay. - Let's do it. Let's go. - [Chris] Don't worry, Tareq, I'll always remember you by this. - [MrBeast] Don't forget, Tareq jumps, you get another $20,000. Godspeed. - Whether you go with him or whether you go by yourself, you're getting out this plane. (laughing) - Oh my God. (dramatic music) - How high are we? 10,000 feet? Oh my God. - [Dino] I'm gonna see
you on the ground, baby! (music ramps up) Here we go. (beat drops) (thrilling music) There's that triangle. I'm gonna hit it, man. We're gonna get that money. (thrilling music) - Apparently they just
jumped out of the plane. So we should probably- - Yeah, we should move. - We should get outta the way.
- Yeah, we should get outta the way. (thrilling music) - All right, he's coming in. He's comin' in. Oh, oh, oh! (loud bang) (various exclamations) - [Dino] We just didn't put the brakes on enough, man. - Wait, play the footage back. (slowed exclamations) You landed in the triangle. Here, go back over there. And as far as I can tell, he never left. (cheering) - Thank you, bro! - Hey, wait, where's Tareq? - [Tareq] Oh, this is crazy. (excited exclamations) (cheering) - [Dino] How you feel, baby? You made me feel great. - He landed in the
triangle and won $20,000. And because you jumped,
he just won $40,000. (cheering) - Have you ever had $40,000 in cash? - No. - What are you gonna spend it on? - I don't even know. (laughs) - All right. Well, while he figures that out, let's go check on Darren. According to the cash here, so far you've spent $25,000. I gave you this giant triangle. - I know, I know, I know. - And all you spend is $25,000? - Can I use pallets? - Yes. Get some pallets. Put 'em in this triangle. I'm gonna go give away more money. We need food to feed people. Neil. Under this black blanket is a triangle and whatever you can fit in that triangle, I'll pay for. - It's a big black tarp though. - It is a big black tarp. There's no key indicators here. Anyways, grab whatever you can. - Those are like $2,000. - These are $400
- That's what I'm gonna get. - Supreme clippers.
- That's what I saw. - I almost have $5,000
in my hands right now. - Let's put it on the table. - You're confident whatever triangle is over here, these are fitting in it? - [Neil] No, I'm not. - Baseball bat. - We could probably stack
it on the side, right? If I think it's not gonna fit, I could put it aside.
- No. Whatever you put here, you have to put in the triangle. If it doesn't fit, you
have to put it back. - We might have to put some stuff back. - Put back the baseball bat. Do I have to say it? - Wait, so you're
putting these shoes back? If you're sure. Here you go.
- I'm not sure. - Then I think it's time we show 'em the triangle. - [Chris] The moment
you've been waiting for. - [MrBeast] Wait. This is really cool.
- [Neil] We're supposed to look at my triangle. - [MrBeast] Oh yeah, we were supposed to reveal this. (various exclamations) - [Neil] Oh man, that's easy. - Oh!
- I can stack in there, easy. - [MrBeast] Sorry, this was my pizza box. I accidentally left it there. Did you think this was the triangle? I totally didn't put it
there to throw him off so he wouldn't spend as much money 'cause there's like a
$1,000,000 in this store. (slowed effect) There's
no key indicators here. - [Neil] I'm still gonna
go with the game plan even though it's
unnecessary at this point. (dramatic music) - [Chris] Oh. - [Karl] You're not using much... (alarmed exclamations) - [Chris] What're you doing? - [MrBeast] What're you doin'? - That legit scared me. (laughs) - [Chris] Come on. - All right, you're good.
- Stop. Stop! (all exclaiming) Oh my gosh. - [Karl] It can't touch this. - [Chandler] You can't touch the tape. - [Neil] Your finger was blocking it. - You're welcome. - I coulda kept my bat. That was the one thing that I really felt bad about.
- Your bat? (explosion) - Okay. Congratulations. You made it all fit. What do you have to say before we go? - Man, thank you guys for everything. This is awesome. Thank you for the tips put in the bag. It was definitely needed
to fit in the triangle. - [Chandler] Yeah.
- Appreciate everything. - And now it's your guys' turn. Chris, I need you to go hide. Far away. Anything you fit in this triangle, Chris will pay for. But when you finish,
we're gonna remove it all. And anything Chris fits in this triangle, you'll have to pay for. Do you think Chris is
gonna go easy on you? - He'll go easy. I'm running up though. - Yes!
(clapping) - While you're doing this, just remember he has a kid and a wife. - Oh well. (laughing) - Alexander McQueens. Yeah, we'll take some of those. - Why is this a thing? This is Supreme Wheaties. You're gonna make Chris pay for this? - Yeah, we gotta get that. - Why are making him pay for this? - I'm thinking of the children. - It's for you though. - Oh, I get to keep this? - Yeah.
- Yes. - Oh. - But Chris gets to do the same thing. - Oh. (giggling) - He didn't even get it. (grunting) What did Chris do to you? That's so much money. - I know. He's gonna hate me. - [MrBeast] Wow, you went easy on Chris. I was joking. Chris is literally gonna hate you. Chris is gonna be mad. - Big mad. - What's the total? - $6,574.45 - Chris is gonna screw you over. Get outta here. Chris! Chandler filled this triangle with stuff that you have to pay for, which we hid. And now we're gonna have you do the same thing for Chandler. - How much did he spend? - How much do you think he spent? - Like, $4,000. - $4,000 is the friendship barrier? - Uh-huh. And is that okay? - You're not gonna get anything outta me. - Is that a big or a small number? - We're not giving you hints. - Is that a big one? - We're saying go grab stuff and put in that triangle. - Grab whatever you want. - I literally set this aside before the video started and I was like, "I'm gonna buy this" but now Chandler's gonna buy it. - Just for fun, you should get this brick that caused Chandler to lose here. - Not only did it cause him to lose, it also just cost him $100. - Hey.
(explosion) - Let's go! - What if Chandler didn't put anything in the triangle? Or what if he only put one pair of shoes? - L! (laughing) Maybe I should have got a bigger book bag. - [Karl] Why are you doing it like that? - [Chandler] You guys ready? - [Karl] Okay. (ding) - All right. And what is the total of
everything he grabbed? - $4,558.18 - Whoops, I broke the
$4,000 friendship limit. Sorry, Chandler. - Chandler is standing
in front of what he got. And Chris is standing
in front of what he got. Gentlemen, take off the blindfolds. (dramatic boom) - Ey, it's pretty even! Did you try to stay under $4,000? (laughter) - Oh my God, no! I didn't see the other side. - Chris, you have to pay
off $6,500 worth of stuff. (laughing) And Chandler, you have to pay
$4,500 worth of stuff off. - The friendship limit's $4,000. - You owe $6,500. You owe 4,500, hug it out. And while you guys are paying for stuff, we're going to the next place. This is Heather and she works
at a children's hospital. Whatever you can fit in here, I'll pay for so we can donate. - [All] Toys, toys, toys, - I don't know why we're chanting. Toys. Assembly line. - [Chris] Whoa. Salmon. - I can just like, see the kids light up when they see this stuff. It's gonna be so cool. Dinosaurs. (explosion) - [MrBeast] We also brought some PlayStation 5s for the children. I think we call it here? (explosion) We're gonna check out and then go take it to the hospital. We checked out, loaded up the U-Haul, and drove everything to a local children's hospital. The children and staff there were so excited to receive everything and I'm just beyond
grateful we could help them. - [All] Thank you, MrBeast! - Karl, do you remember in GameStop where you did this? - (slowed down) No! - That was literally yesterday. - Because of that, he lost the GameStop. I think you know where
we're going with this. I put a whiteboard on Karl's floor. - [Karl] That's not an Expo marker. - Is that a peanut?
- Is that a triangle? - Zealous, anything you put in this oval, I'll pay for. Let's go steal stuff from Karl. Ay, yo, bro, bro, bro. - What? - If you're gonna take the PlayStation, take the controller. - [Nolan] This guy has another PS5. - That was my secret one. - [Zealous] This is
nerve-wracking, actually. Jimmy, can you catch this Power Glove? - [MrBeast] Sure. - [Karl] Not the Power Glove. - [Nolan] That's a mini fridge. - [Karl] It's my Monster fridge. - [Zealous] All right, hopefully nothing falls. - Wait, slow and steady. - Yep, yep, yep. - I can't believe that worked. - Is that Totoro?
(laughing) (squeak) Oh, he's so cute. They took gaming consoles
and laid a TV on it. They're serious. - [All] Robbing Karl, robbing Karl. - [MrBeast] All right,
take your hands off. It's good. This is all balancing
on two PlayStation 5s. - Yeah, I think we'll call it here. - Congratulations on all this stuff and Karl, everything he took, I'm gonna buy you a replica of. - [Zealous] Oh! - All right!
- Let's go! So, he didn't actually take anything, I'm gonna buy replicas for Karl, next bit. All right, Darren (indistinct) - [Chris] What the heck? There's so much food here. - I think it's been 12 hours. I don't even know anymore, but I have given this everything I got and I couldn't even come close to matching your generosity. - [Chris] Yeah. - You know what you coulda done? You coulda just taken apart the triangle and put it around Sam's Club. - That woulda been easier. - You managed to put a lot of food in this triangle, cut the drone shot. Let's go see the total. And now the moment of truth. Buffy, tell me the damage. How much did Darren spend? - $82,058. - You couldn't even get over $100,000? - I did my best, man. - Genuinely thank you so much for staying open late. Can I shake your hand? - [Buffy] Yes.
- [MrBeast] I appreciate you. - We were happy to help you guys. - Because of the food
we bought in this video, we're literally gonna start servicing another community every two weeks. Go check out the Beast
Philanthropy channel. We'll show you there. Goodbye. (explosion) (cheerful music) (explosion)
