oh my goodness look at that the man the myth the legend Ginger bill it's a night oh my God I'm doing well yeah let me put those address codes so I just came appropriate so you look really good I I must say that I can I can tell right away that you clearly are very talented uh eloquent uh you obviously know today's modern modern fashion very modern these headphones aren't even plugged in that's that's why how much I am in yeah yeah that's but that's what you gotta do you gotta live the life it's not about just doing it here and there it's about living the life of course you got you got to take it to the stream you've got to be prime level that's what you're gonna do yeah you know I'm gonna take these off because I can't hear a thing properly okay that's fine you are the creator of Odin Lang that is correct yes oh wow okay okay so let's kind of let's start like maybe a little bit more origin story here what inspired you to kind of create something different there's a lot of options out there right Nims even you know catching some steam Zig everyone's loving Zig why create something different as opposed to investing in what is so to give you the short story I started it nearly seven years ago and at the time there were no options oh so what I mean by that is I am primarily a CNC plus plus developer that's what my background is anyway when did I've done many of the things as well I've done python I've done not got Matlab as well I've done many things throughout my career in different languages and of the Year 20 2016 I'm not gonna I'm gonna give the short story of it rather than a long story but let's say I got so fed up receivers plus so what one day effectively I just went look I can do a better job myself but before I even did that I went look are there any other languages out there that I wanted I wanted a statically typed compiled language okay I had manual memory management okay I like I like all those things yeah that which was better than substantially better than CNC plus unfortunately that rules out rust by the way so rust was out there at the time but Russ is not actually manual managed by default it still has automatic memory management everywhere okay can you can you dive into that a little bit and what you mean by Russ doesn't have it because I think most people would consider it in some sense manual memory management even though you're right it's like is there are places where they will automatically allocate memory for you but when I say completely manual I want Custom allocators Custom support of things everywhere by default I don't even want the allocator allocating things in in behind me just because it needs to handle have a lifetimes work or any anything like that or the copy Constructors or anything of that nature I know that's not what they call them in Rust but you know in that sense okay yeah yeah we call them copy traits implementers yes that's exactly what I mean yes all those type classes yeah yeah so wait so if you were to redo Odin today do you think you would have fallen into the zig area and just tried to improve that or do you think Oden Lang is still the right choice to this day I'd still say Saint right choice to stay so I know Andrew Kelly quite well I'm friends with him I've known him for a few years now and the zig language we we've spoken to a lot but we've got completely different philosophies and I think that's kind of the different things is like they are very different languages very different feeling like and I always recommend people always try out what you can if you've got an opportunity to try different languages try as many as you can because you'll be surprised what you actually like and what you don't like yeah maybe like Ziggy my like code and you might not like any of them they may want to use rust and that's great and um those are the kind of things that you have to try out so yeah I think we give her they are very different languages and people who've tried both they'll go yeah they feel very very different as well okay okay um that's I I really like that kind of approach to life because you know I've seen a few people in over you know the course of my career where they've done just one language their entire time and you know it's not bad to be specialized like I think that's a very good thing but they have no other perspective and so I think there's something about that that's kind of you know Trixie I think even I fell into that trap right at one point I thought Java was the best language why would you write anything but Java yeah and then I wrote JavaScript I thought why would you write anything but Java and then eventually I wrote something else and I thought oh wow this is actually really exciting and so it's kind of always seemed like the more I got exposed the more I realized how much differently you can write software or really how much differently you can think about a problem by just seeing difference in how you can express it and so that's really powerful to me yeah indeed and I think for me to many ways I think language is just tools like it is a tool to get the job done the problems I'm trying to solve at the end of the day and I do want the decent the best tools I can get as well for that job I don't really care what that tool is if it's the best of the job I'm going to be using it okay so if it and that's kind of thing for me but it was like for me I knew I could make better tools for myself so I just made them so I have a quick question I have a good I have a quick question there because because I hear this phrase all the time and you don't fall into my typical category of someone saying that phrase use the best tool for the job yeah I know it's a bit cliche it is super cliche and usually what it means is I'm going to use JavaScript so how do you determine what is the best tool for the job what is like your criteria for determining that there's a lot of different criteria of stuff is for instance uh if the problem has already been treated before like okay what see what's already done and see use that thing so if I I'm my background's actually in physics I'm a physicist by professional wow so I would have um if I was doing something complicated like I need to do some statistical stuff like okay I know these tools okay we'll say go to use Python use numpy and titles do that or if I had to use Matlab because it was like the top they told me to use it I'd do that or if we had a big set of libraries we had to use that language or if I know I'm having to do low level stuff at the time I would just use C because I know I have to write onto an embedded machine like there were different tools I'll sometimes just write assembly because I needed to actually get every single thing and I couldn't rely on the C compiler that was provided for me for that embedded machine the best tools I know it's a cliche thing to say but it's very much like the reason why I say it's like yeah but you need to know your Alternatives you need to know your options like don't just say oh the best thing is like you say JavaScript in your sense but it's like do you know what the alternatives are and if you don't know the Alternatives you can't really say it's the best tool yeah you can't do those comparisons I like that I like that a lot because uh it requires you to have a broader perspective which means that I think a lot of times what we mean when we say the best tool that for the job is we mean the best tool given our time constraints and our knowledge and so often that just means I'm going to go default to using the tool that I'm most familiar with because I know I can solve yes the problem in it not necessarily that I can solve it well or even if I know that there's a better way to solve it I just know I can and so I always you know it it trips me up a little bit because you know I often will fall into this trap like recently just at Netflix uh I work on Netflix by the way uh obligatory I work in that place um when I was there I've been creating this project and as of this last couple weeks there's more and more people asking for service so they can integrate their tools they want to be able to call out into an endpoint I can I was having 16 gigabyte instances not even being able to handle five concurrent requests because of how much memory JavaScript uses and the amount of information that I was going through so I was very curious so I just went and grabbed rust uh built something that grabbed all the same memory and did effectively the same thing it was less than one tenth of memory and I realized okay so the failure here isn't that I did the right thing it's that I chose the wrong tool at the beginning I solved the right problem with the wrong tool and now I'm having to create this for Effective purposes a bastardized version of the program or actually check to see if a binary is in the path and call into that and have it solve it for me in a lower memory sense and then still have my node service that's interact you know that interacts with the Netflix ecosystem in a very simple way and so I'm like trying to cheat my way through the system for this exact reason which is you know it's just a reminder for how important it is to choose the right thing because you don't know how far these things are going to go and even if you do choose the right thing in the moment it may not be the right thing forever no no and sometimes a quick bodge or a hack or whatever you want to call it is sometimes better just understand like get it out there like I don't know sometimes the solution I just have to do it yeah so I just use the tools the languages are most proficient with at the moment it's now Odin I'm just literally defaulting Odin most the time but I used to go to either sometimes python I used to go to C plus plus C literally I'd be using any language like what everything is like oh I'm gonna do this just touch it here I didn't really care it was just very much a I knew I got this done I can get it done in this do it but it's kind of gotten to that point where I don't know there's and maybe I'm just probably this very laid back as a bloke in this case but um like use what soul is best for you as well because I don't when people say hold up Russ is the best language in the world or no it's near or is it uh JavaScript or whatever I'm like is it good for you Greg go go ahead do whatever yeah as long as it's good enough for you you're problem solving and don't and if you're doing it commercially good for your customers yeah don't forget them yeah okay so so let's get let's let's kind of focus on Odin Lane because you said you're building pretty much everything in Odin link which is Odin laying a general purpose programming language that is correct yes it's a general purpose program language it would be I would cast it as an alternative to C um on the emphasis on like the joy of programming compared to just having to pull your hair up whatever little we've got left yeah um for when you're doing C I can see that you've done a lot of C in your life I'm sorry yeah unfortunately yes yeah yeah that's it yeah that's I mean this is what a head of hair looks like when you do Java you know you just get a little bit you get a little bit more hair in the end I know I just I tried to the C plus plus but it just remained the same yeah I know it just doesn't help uh well it doesn't help you might have a parent Constructor problem though like if we're being real here uh okay maybe so so you did give me some like examples of Odin Lang I'd like to look at a couple things that make it easy I right away see Dynamics uh arrays and strings because yeah those two things in C well they're not fun well really any data structure is not fun and see you have to hand roll everything yourself so I'd love to to look at some of these so I see a bunch of different ones what is like a good one I can jump into to kind of see some basic things the best one out on that is actually not in that demosition it was the one I gave you was the demo the Odin file that pretty much just shows you just Odin there's the overview which is fine but the demo.one file which one of that whatever it was okay hold on oh there we go there we go this one right here there we go it's this big beast but it has literally pretty much everything you can learn a lot from that just by reading it top down it's a very simple language okay yeah the package thing is like similar to go but it's influenced from like the modular family in that sense okay and so since this one's package made I assume that your program assumes there's a main function in this file correct the lease is the main function yes entry point you have double entry point yep score is uh your standard Library correct yeah we caught the core library because they're trying to stay away from STDs as much as I possibly can you know that's a good so yeah yeah okay so what's going on here what what what is this so we're just showing the basics General syntax the Declarations and such like this because Odin's declaration syntax is quite foreign to most people yeah but it's quite simple it is name colon type and then it's constants another colon and then the expression itself so it's just name type expression okay you've had to say like rust has got like a decoration the front lights it's Funk like impact goes as Funk or is it f fun in if you're in gut rust um so they say in that sense they have the specify what type of Declaration is then the name then the expression Odin just says Nope just put the name at the beginning and then separated with the curl ones that's thing so it's a little bit weird but he's a very kind of elegant design with how it actually works with the Declarations intacts okay YouTube very quickly this this it's it's the basics two colons means it's static did you say this is a like a constant constant declaration okay constant and then it's constant because it's a function and there's no return to this function I assume correct yes it's no returns yes okay cool and obviously your standard hello world right there why hello yeah hello uh it's always what I've been using instead of hello um it goes back from I just remember hearing this woman kept saying hello hello all the time and I just couldn't stop laughing so I've just kept it okay that was literally it goes back a day that's it's random it's just for me it's idiosyncratic okay uh obviously you have these uh what is this like a scope lock is that what we're looking at here just a skull block very again it's very C like in that regards we're not trying to do we're not trying to be very radical in this case in design okay so you've declared it you've declared it int it may or may not be uh it's not initialized initialized always to zero in Odin the default initialization's to zero and I can see where nothing everything could be just run about you I honestly I cannot tell you how many I am just four weeks ago I had to fix a I had to fix the bug in one of my little Netflix pieces of Hardware because I was passing back a value an integer that I forgot I didn't initialize and I just didn't never said they passed it into me I never said it and just like that was it and of course that means my video frame size was just like some astronomic figure and I kept getting all these overflows or underflows and I was just like what what's happening how am I ruining this right now and I couldn't figure it out and of course that's because I'd forgotten and that's why there's loads it's loads of stuff like an Odin we've tried to fix the problems that people hadn't seen and just go one by one okay what's this problem okay fix that one what's this one okay do this one because there's loads of loads and loads of issues in C yeah and we've pretty much just got rid of all of them okay nice pretty much it as much you can strings we've got string type because why would you want to do no terminated pointers like yeah that's just I understand back in the 70s when memory was concerned I'm like oh storing an extra length is actually all difficult yes yes when when bytes were the level of concern right now we're more in the gigabytes are the level of concern so I feel like we got some wiggle room I I have 24 gigabytes of vram on my graphics card yeah it's a very different land we're in now yeah okay so you got some you got Unicode you can do standard exams what is this little does this mean just like so this means we're just assigning it to nothing it's just the like seem to go in that sense for people who could listen to he's just signs to nothing because Odin has multiple return values as like similar to go or like lure okay I do want to let you know you just lost all street cred with me and my audience right now I just opened this up and see something that's it yeah I know I know Windows some windows action going on right here no no because then it's easier to port to Linux rather than the other way around usually so that's usually what I do that's my personal view yeah is that true when you do an application development yeah it's much easier to go from Windows to Linux than the Linux to Windows why is that just just out of my own personal curiosity um because when you're a Linux developer you're seeing positive everywhere and you assume any other tools that don't even exist and many libraries which are not part of the C library but they're part of the Unix so when you work with Windows it's made clearly obvious they don't exist okay okay so it's like you just don't touch them okay sorry my wife's telling me uh my wife cannot currently make a smoothie without making too much so I have a lot of oh you guys can't even see it it's green it's a green smoothie but you can't see it or lovely wife you've got there thank you I think she's lovely too all right so you got some python styled lengthening here right that's that's pretty yes just go do the same thing ideas from python mainly anyway but I hadn't many influences from literally dozens of languages okay you can scroll down this is just based literally the basic syntax most people understand this this is just the oh you've got certain types his assignments how they work oh can your heart can you help me with this one what what happens here you've got a float but I see an end so I like my brain so in Odin it's trying to explain um the console value system so to go explain why this even exists C exists so in C all literals are typed you may not realize this many people don't but if you just type them one that's got type in 1.0 it's a double yep but in Odin it's like no the value is fine this is one that could be represented as an integer so we'll be able to use it as an integer it is just the number one doesn't matter if it's 1.000 it's still one question if it's 1.1 what happens here it would just say nope this is an error you can't do this you'd have a truncation so okay yeah so he's trying to get around many of those issues that you would have in C again obviously very cool it's yeah it's many of those little things here but this line right here like for those that don't type in that don't use a like a strictly type language this is one of the most incredible things ever you just assigned a float with the number one like this is really really great this is just beautiful that it knows the underlying type and it goes oh I know what a one is that's a 1.0 right like that that's that's exactly and there's loads of type inference within Odin as well like it's just it we even try and minimize the amount of types you have to type obviously but he's still all statically typed so it's just like okay just like again Russ does this as well so there's nothing like a new it's just if you've been using CNC Plus for years you're like wow this is new yeah well Russ does not allow this right here no no no that's uh you know there's that one theoretical number that's 16 digits long that you typed in that does not quite translate well it literally the compiler will figure out is this representable by this type and if not it just won't allow it oh interesting okay okay yeah yeah I like that all right so we got this thing right here let's go and let's keep on going new variables keep going oh is this a tuple oh oh nice you got three um okay multiple return values does that happen from functions as well yes yes it does completely everywhere much it's much closer to like lower than it is go in this regard that's more um expansive I do like multiple return values what's the difference between why a multiple return value versus a tuple right because aren't they in memory the same thing no oh so so this gets a little bit bizarre so a tuple or a tuple I have no idea I'm gonna say Tuple because it's not like Tupperware or something I don't know um the um a tuple is like a struct but it's with a bit of bit extra sugar and also less sugar at the same time so it's like trying to go on the keto by having the um like they shook free stuff I don't know it's a little bit all over the place but I mean it's still a strict in memory while multiple term values inodently it's their abis they're passed individually all different on the apis there might be multiple registers they may be one is ready but they'll end the rest past this pointer it'll do whatever the best like most efficient way of doing it is so they're not actually one construct in memory they are actually separate values okay so you'll get some nice um again if you're super plus crowd in there the copy lesion effects in there as well so you just minimize wasting the stack okay okay one quick question did you need to do these extra little uh scope locks or is that just like habitual it's just for documentation in your code folding usually in editors well okay oh oh okay so you take advantage of cold folding I never thought yes oh okay so I know some people do I just like doing that's why I put the comments next to the blocks as well when you called code yeah what thing is yeah yeah okay just I'm pondering it that seems interesting all right no no no okay so you got your traditional for Loops obviously super uncool these days like Twitter would hate they are super and cool but we do have don't worry we have the fancy for Loops as well don't worry okay okay I would just like to let you know though people very angry right now all right your standards shorthanding okay so you just replace the wire colons because the semicolons would just say drop them just make it a while loop yep okay yeah okay then you got the forever one okay okay I like that driver just show off oh yeah the fancier ones I've got ranges both yes so this I the syntax here I think I actually borrowed from um rust if I remember correctly okay that particular syntax like the equal sign so you know which one's the range when you're looking at it because the dot dot means I had so many different things in different languages if you go from Ruby and you go to rust they're the opposite to each other it's really confusing oh yeah that is confusing okay so dot dot less than is an exclusive uh range and this one's an inclusive range correct yes I can buy that that's that's fine I know I I don't hate it I saw a reaction is just like what the hell is that thing doing in there but you know I can get I can get used to it no yeah yes okay okay so how does this work right here so okay strings are assumed utf-8 or are they of course utf-8 they are assumed you cannot enforce because anyone could just put bites in a round of mode obviously okay well yeah I think rust always like enforces it doesn't it I can't remember if rust and forces yeah will we effectively assume everywhere and we have like CC never had a code it literally like what do you call it what's the coding convention I can't think of character encoding that's the word I'm looking for so it could be anything no it's utf-8 it's the best worst choice you could get whatever yeah okay so we got to say we got your static arrays right here right static rays and slices as well so C doesn't have these obviously um as well so slice is the one without a value in there so it contains a pointer and a length that's all it is very simple okay and this one on the other hand contains a pointer and a length and a capacity well it's a it's a static yeah just a static array so yeah yeah and then but this one on the other hand contains a pointer a capacity and a length correct and also an allocator because we support custom allocators at the language level so yeah okay okay so it contains so you each allocate each Dynamic array and use the dynamic Maps can have a different allocated to them as well so okay so is that a extra word length for for the is it like two actually um makes an extra two because of how the allocator is developed for optimization reasons because we don't do inheritance okay uh thank you The Inheritance is the one flaw of oop that I feel like is just it's the it's the Pit of Doom versus the pit of success I I don't have a problem with classes it's not even it's not even it's just how people instruct our inheritance as well like internally it's just bad yeah it's just bad every time I use inheritance I'm like this is this is the I do it literally all the time I I once every three weeks I try inheritance again and I go this is the problem to use it then afterwards like oh this wasn't the problem I tried again and I fail every single time in hater the only time to use it is when you're forced to use it pretty much I know I I keep saying that but I keep wanting it to not be true because my head It Feels So sensible oh on automobile in a Lamborghini right subclassic and you just feel it feels so right every time I hate it every time oh yeah oh I I fell off oh my God you see all the other stuff here let's just squint it through whatever I actually do want to look at that because there's some things I do want to see here yeah yeah uh because I really like sorry these are these are the things that are very interesting because I'm coming at this with this idea of being a you know like a sleep replacement yeah how do I get down here again logic I don't know yeah let's get rid of windows web browsers they don't I never know how they work yeah they're like magnets yeah that was a very good joke actually I know how magnets work that's the thing um damn it that was such a good joke and then you ruined it I know I've got to ruin it I'm sorry all right so this is Ghost kind of ghost Island it was this going to go style issue yeah yeah but with extra much better features like that map is heavily optimized it's actually SOA based internally what is SOS completely cash a structure of a raise so instead of arrays of structures it's structure array so the better way of thinking is that you know you've got to say a struct and you've had Ray over each elements individually what a structure of Ray does is each element is an array of itself so you have an array of x's array of y's and Ray of Z's rather than having an array of xyz's if that makes any sense it's an optimization benefit don't worry think about it for a second because that just you just you just WTF to me yeah don't worry it's like explain these words that aren't easy it's like you have to just show it sometimes in code it's like ECS it's what's someone's saying components in that sense kind of yeah yeah okay then one more quick thing this the fur is just like ghost defer where at the end of this box it's not function exit yeah because goes is the way it is because of how the garbage collector and exceptions work it's insane with scope exit which being sensible yeah okay so this one upon the scope your control float even is named control flow upon exiting this scope delete gets called on these items one more quick question because I'm gonna ask my most frustrating question with go if you were to not initialize this map like if you just defined it as a type and I try to access it is it a null pointer exception or is it a hey zero but you can actually just check on it as well so I did copy the zero the go thing here but the reason is most of the Odin language is making the zero value useful or zero is initialized and it's taking it quite kind of just taking it seriously so you're in that sense you may not like it but it's you can always check to see it exists it's there's lots of different ways okay it hurts me a little bit but I'll accept that all right I can understand I can understand why people don't like it but yeah sure okay everything doesn't have exceptions though that's the problem it's like C doesn't have exceptions okay oh really what does it have does it have error says values we have errors values multi-term values and loads of decent things we don't do the stupid uh if nil thing like go does all right can you hear where's the air section I want to see errors here type in or or it's all underscore return quite easily um so these just just write a basic in on whatever fine um and it's showing all the different random calling stuff fine if you just scroll down a little bit struggling on the syntax so this one Auto puts in effectively error.net oh interesting okay correct and it's it's implicit yes this um just because it knows what the type is so it just says oh okay we just don't actually type it for you yeah this can be a comment okay I've seen this one yeah okay this is a go this is a dig directly Echo okay oh my goodness there we go okay so hey so hold on all right you must address this somewhere else yes right here so yes y equals this or return and so how does this what happens here what is or return it effectively does the exact same logic as the thing above does it does the if statement and then returns it and Returns the it that error value as the last value for you okay okay you're you're getting a little error value right here yeah yeah it does a default thing because they are named at the top so they'll act as variables they've got the naked return going on maker returns yeah which allows for the beauty of the all return they are they complement each other a girl would do something like this I I actually really think that this is a good uh yeah this is a good middle ground yeah it's a good middle ground it's not quite like I'm not a fan of naked returns but if they gave me this I could love them yeah again I'm not I wasn't big fan of Bank returns until I had this okay okay so it was very much a but no I was like oh God now I understand them all right okay this is very uh this is very let's see hold on let's see how I'm using non-bear oh it's a Han do you have a example of the if statement with the error so let's see do this one no and it's just explaining sometimes you may want to have it have a different error and you want to handle it differently so you want to change what the thing is so that's just showing you that you have to be a bit more explicit but again Odin is trying to be hey look this is what's going on we're not trying to hide the control flow um this is the thing yeah okay and then what is this right here explain this so this is just deferring an if statement that's it and all it does is that gets called after the return so that means actually so it's a bit clever and not regard yes you want to sit with a voice it might be you want to do some cleanup you may want to set certain turn values whatever and it's just a way of get handling all those such that this is super cool this is actually super duper cool because yes that's the exact thing where if you have multiple early returns handling error conditions having this thing where you have to like copy out this logic or find some way to do something to said other variables this is actually this is super cool this is super cool okay because sometimes if you fail on a fairway case you want to actually handle some of the other things to clean up yeah and like I know this is it you can't I mean like rust you can get around it but even with like Russ's question mark thing it's like it's just now we're just fair we don't have to clean everything up and hopefully they drop things get cool yeah yeah yeah like it's a little bit more like you just programming in a different style yeah okay okay very very cool is there anything else you people would want to see just about the language um about language it would just be because this was a good little kind of that's a good little thing random things yeah some of the things that people asking like the SOA stuff or even like I say the array programming stuff so in Odin we don't have operator bloating because we just added the things you'd actually add operating overloading for which in in C in sequel to A C plus plus you're adding it for data types well they already exist in Odin so that's already sold and we also would have been for like a math types like when you're making a game you want to vector and you want to do all that sort of stuff and you want to add two arrays together well you can just add two arrays together it's that other words just goes value by value and just walks through yeah value yep we even have matrices built into language for you so if you're doing like games and everything is built in the arrays also have swizzling things um I don't know I'm not saying Swizzle on that I'm more of a saying if you've ever used glso and you've got this like the dot XYZ and you can put them in different orders and it'll do that correctly well that's built into a language because the computer does it why not have a feature to do it if the computer can do it directly okay yeah I I don't do GSL I don't do anything if anyone's a game developers here they'll be like oh God this is oh I wish I had this in another language we can though okay okay I like that that's actually pretty cool so one last I think one thing I keep saying over here which is generics what do you have for generics we do have generics um just literally control F and look for the dollar symbol and then that will give you up the parametric polymorphism okay there's a little example that's just how you make a maybe type or an option type whatever you want to call it but here we go some more generic things everywhere so in this case it's like we're saying hey the dollar sign on a little on on one of the names in it in this parameter on this function it'll go oh this means this is a constant parameter name t and it takes in a type ID so a type and you can just pass that around this work you can apply that generic things onto structs as well onto unions whatever okay so what going on here what what is this uh what is that that symbol so that's a pointer this is pointers they're pointy and Odin brother star or an ampersand it's a pointer this comes from Pascal oh the reason why is because on the left it's a pointer and on the right you're de-referencing it so that in Odin it's very consistent the types on the left the usage is on the right it's really easy to read at types in Odin okay so this is okay so hold on just so I understand this yeah absolutely you created a new concrete type from t yes then Yep this means it is a reference 2T we're dereferencing it dereferencing that type okay thing okay so new increase pointer yeah and this thing is the D reference into this drive I don't know what that means yet but then you're recording this is that's magic yeah okay and there you go huh okay hmm sorry that's actually uh okay so this okay okay I got this all okay so if you wanted a point for something yeah if you wanted a pointer to something you'd be pointy on the left hand side treating it like that side yes correct and if you wanted the D reference that you put on the other side correct yeah same with the ray if you have an array you put the square brackets on the left hand side and then you access it on the right hand side does that mean you can go like T do you do t uh cap or whatever you call this pointy uh dot or do you just go t Dot how do you access into it you can just do you can do both we have a little bit of implicit dereference there we compiler goes like Oh we know you meant to just do reference it we'll just do it for you okay it's called a carrot everyone's making fun of me because apparently yeah it is well okay all right this is great this is great this is actually really really cool so you actually have some cool like examples of things that you have you you guys have built especially this Ember gen business thing right here so um this is what we work in jangrafx all of our products are written at Odin we've got about half a million lines of Odin code at this point uh a company all right all right so we have amberjen which is this amazing piece offer every smoke fire an explosion in this trailer is made with amberjen okay he's rolling games films and TV shows okay hold on hold on hold on one second so all of this the concrete coming up everything is the car is not the concrete just the fire and explosions and uh the smoke yes so yeah we do real time volume um simulations that's what we're doing real in real time okay okay yes a fire yep the air bending there yes okay oh wow and so when you say real time do you mean that what does that mean does that mean it's computed upon render in real time and then yeah yeah as in you can drag around and you can see the effects in real time all that the old the competition before of us we just have to wait weeks literally weeks for it to render really so is this like the Toy Story thing where they like to render Toy Story it took like 9 000 computers multiple years to rendering yeah oh yeah we've gone from being like Oh I'm gonna have to wait a week for this to render out compared to oh I can't even get a cup of coffee it's done oh really okay so so okay so before like literally before your product you're talking yeah 72 hours 100 plus hours of compute time to do this and it so what what was the unlocking Secrets I don't know if you can share that but what makes it so good for unlocking the the GPU itself so we haven't actually technically Odin has helped us to do the entire application in many cases but we've unlocked the power of the GPU understanding how that works and exploiting it because it does certain calculations faster than a CPU does and that kind of thing so we on GP we're just still using glso because you kind of have to or some of the shade language but everything else how it all interacts is with Odin because we are trying to it was we're trying to play CNT response for ourselves we have it's just so much nicer to use as a language it is but the thing is also on our team there's about 9 or 10 Odin developers now and it's just it's a pleasure compared to if I was on the same size of team with C plus plus I'd be pulling out my hair on my beard I still every single time I open up the application I go I don't know how that works like I just look at macro code oh yeah looking at like these preprocessors making stuff all over the place and I go I can't understand anything that's happening in this language oh speaking of macros does Odin have any first class support like rust for macros or no okay okay is that a design decision or just no it's a design decision yes yeah I'm not a big fan of how do I put this I'm not a big fan of all Russ macros I just think they're it's pretty bluntly insane oh okay macro rules I have seen some stuff where people have done insane things with them I'm like um I know please don't I'm like I'm not very smart I can't read this I keep trying to make macros work lately because I've been trying to toy around with this project where I'm I'm trying to get something working and every time I build and I got that that's it's the wrong move I can feel it right now is the wrong move yeah it's more about like I'm not that smart okay I I'm not good at trust future build to be able to do this like present Bill's not that smart future Bill's Dumber I'm going to bet this so don't do it don't do it what do you think about zig's uh comp time though yeah so I was originally wanting something like that before even comp time existed because I was discussing with Andy about this um and then I originally went no I'm just gonna go more the more traditional approach okay um right it almost kind of it is almost but not full way there um it's not even it's literally a design decision it's not a technical one it is literally I went no I I don't want to go that full Direction so we have enough to you've got enough to do generics everything you can do in like templates and Super Splash you can do an Odin effectively okay but it's cleaner nicer again it's not insane are you able to uh constrain I forget what they call them NC plus plus uh 20 Concepts or trait are you able to trade out two things to a certain extent so we don't have traits in Odin okay well um we don't even have methods in Odin all data just plain old data it's very dumb in that regard it's just you have Standalone procedures nothing else but one thing I did Nick from rust as a Nick to wear conditions okay I think we're constraining them at the end doing it that way okay so if you need to do something or you can constrain like basic ones with little types and such so there you go where Clauses there you go oh interesting you can have like a programmatic one right here which is like yeah this function has to be called where X is greater than one yes and then you can also do this type of yeah that's just showing like this is these are pure sanity checks but then you can say more explanatory things below it here like for instance oh I want a cross product but make sure that the element of the array has to be a numeric type so do that okay done okay so you can restrict it so yeah yeah because it won't be a two multiplications on like booleans or strings so just restrict it that's in your code but you're putting it at a non-shitty version of assertions yeah yeah because I used a lot of assertions these days I'm actually I I took the Lex Friedman approach and starting to like increase everywhere everywhere and they've just been great so yeah I draw the crash early and then fix it run for them like just putting this up it's cheap yeah I didn't get rid of them later anyway this is this is super cool so you have compiled time effectively of the static assertions or whatever they call them and yes and the the first thing language all right okay so real question what I'm seeing here is I see a pretty viable uh alternative to C plus plus in the truest sense right Russ I don't feel like is it's not really the successor right rust minus minus is jokingly C plus plus but it's not really a successor it's a different language with different kind of principles whereas this one feels like a potential successor to see much like zig yes I do feel like uh this one do you think here in some amount of years you'll see Odin much more popular in the gaming industry yeah I I think it's probably much more appealing to people like in the game industry or visual effects industry or even tooling industry but that's kind of where we've kind of it's just been tailored like okay like for instance in Odin we have all of the graphics apis already built into Library we even have metal natively which may not sound impressive to some people like no no you could only use metal metal from Objective C and Swift we now have we can call objective sequels directly no problem okay so just spent we I spent a week doing that I went okay I'll just do it all right then follow-up can you do is it is is Odin really easily uh like Zig right isn't that one of the claim to fans of Zig is that it's you can integrate it into an existing project is Odin a very simple language to integrate into say a larger C plus world or is it not really meant the same it's because it's got effectively you can always export functions no problem or import C functions it's got the foreign import system no problem so you can because it's the ca cabi every language knows the cabi which is the application binary interface for people in there now um but that's very easy to integrate Zig on the other hand I know I'll just clarify zigg's main thing is why once you can replace it is because it couples itself with something called Zig CC which is a clang front end so that's what Zig the compiler tool chain is its selling point it's like we actually have a sane way of installing clang for you guys which allows you to just do everything else while Odin's gone more like yeah we use llvm as well but we're not doing the entire tool chain thing because it is we're just not doing it it's a lot more integrated than that anyway that's why they do it but yeah that's the thing is again that's a zig tool chain rather than Zig the language itself so make it very clear of Hope okay that makes sense all right well this is actually really really cool is there anything else you kind of want to show us and because I know you gave me a couple links I'll I'll paste these all uh because I'll cut this out into a YouTube video I'll paste out all these things in there so people can go check it out uh because this is this is awesome I I will say that Odin I had on the lowest here I'm glad that I can't believe you watched the stream first off I'm like such a scripture well anyways I've been watching you since you were interviewed Casey moratori oh really okay oh okay I'll check this out I've been even enjoying your videos ever since I am such a script Kitty comparatively to you you obviously are Next Level programmer if I'm a 10x or you're 100xer uh but I must say that my perception of Odin has vastly changed I do like I do I'm excited to try it out to build uh yeah I'd like to at least think about trying to build something with it because I love good tooling right that's a huge important part is being able to have a language that builds good tools it's it's a huge pain in the ass to build uh good Dev tools to have good experiences and so anything that shortcuts it right now for me rust is the best language to build Tools in I I'm sick and tired of building tools in JavaScript ever because you know it's loosey-goosey it's really fast at first but then three months into building something it's a horrifying experience and so like even with typescript it's the same you know it's better but still horrifying and so rust has been the best tool so far for me to build stuff in so I'm actually now more Curious Zig wasn't there I will praise I will praise rust word and he's praising like rust is if you need something to be truly safe rust is probably your best bet okay at the moment but that's this one gives you much greater control and it looks simpler it looks like I could probably get running fairly well I'm a simple man I I I find Russ too complicated for me at times I just wanted something dumb or maybe need a Galaxy brain to you know I don't have a Galaxy brain this is already a big enough head already um but yeah that's my third joke I've done about my school I know it's okay it's okay you can make fun of your hair all you want I'll make fun of it too I know okay well hey thanks for coming on thank you for this I think this is fantastic uh dude love I I this the language seems appealing there's some things that they kind of just gave me a weird feel like obviously the the carrot being for pointers I'd have to just play with it for a little bit uh async await I don't I didn't see anything in there about that no no there isn't any async waste mode in um like that it's just a long discussion as to why not yeah um yeah it's actually very big technical discussion that's not a five minute thing that's a five hour thing yeah what about iterators do you have any just like Rusty yeah we're just function calls they're dumb okay but if you have a function call that returns a multiple return values and you put it into a for Loop it will work [Music] oh that's pretty simple yeah but does it have to produce all the stuff up front like that because you say multiple returns so then kind of the Fallout returns so all it has to be is the last value just has to be a Boolean and it says the bowling is literally the the condition to keep going through the loop oh so if it returns like X true then your Loop will call it again it'll go y true and then it'll call it again you know go Z false and I'll go okay we're done here yeah pretty much okay okay I like that all right don't don't add a new console when you can just use something else it's simpler okay one more question sorry I got a couple more languages uh what about threading and all that do you have a pretty simple threading system here what do you got here yeah we got threading we've got all the synchronization Primitives and such um no problem there all the synchronization parameters uh are just like very mutants stuff in there uh we haven't got all I need to work on the write up the channel stuff again that haven't been that yet like in Rust has you know have the uh the the multiprocuser channels and single producer channels I need to add them again um because I've just redone the entire threading stuff so it's it's the fastest possibly can be okay okay so you got condition variables mutexes semiforce oh mutexes yeah four uh and then you got uh okay so you got pretty much all the things you would need so yeah okay very cool I think this was a good tour of the language and it showed okay so look at this we're looking at this little thing right here okay so this is a dynamic array of pointers of thread objects correct did I nail that that's perfect awesome your pro already Fantastic look at that I'm a genius damn uh all right well cool thank you very much for doing this Ginger I take back everything I said about Odin Lang it's super fun you didn't say anything so I said it was dog water too right if I'm not mistaken yeah I think you just shrug to be honest with you're like yeah I don't know it okay it's fine I'm like I wasn't offended don't worry you're a little offended it's just a little bit no it's offended like that's the jangra effects logo I was like what we didn't even get my language oh no yeah it's all like wait what we dunked on the product and not even the language it looked we're the dummies then we are the dummies then yeah all right that's why I was a little bit confused I was like wait what well thank you very much Ginger Ginger where can people find you at let's see I think I if I was thinking I got you on the uh the old twitters I'm on the Twisters at the ginger Bill yep I actually have you right here I'm on YouTube as well underwear Ginger Bell on YouTube do you do any streaming on Twitch in fact that's how Odin started I I got drunk one night started streaming so yeah this part in the area I didn't want it because I didn't know how PC friendly I was meant to be or like a pair I don't know if the children watching or anything I'm trying not to swear either but yes don't get I got drunk one last night because I got thought you know what I can do about a job so I did we got a lot of classic Brits in in the chat right now um yeah okay yeah don't worry we make a lot we make a lot of uh ligma jokes around here so you can you know no no I meant innuendos but I wasn't trying I don't know I wasn't sure you know no it's 10 o'clock for you guys you never know yeah it's it's fairly early okay so yeah so you got drunk one night and said that's it damn it I've created my own language pretty much yeah and how many how many years ago was that uh it'll be seven years in July did you ever guess that getting wasted caused a seven year career no this is like uh is this real like I'm living my dream job at the moment like programming in the language I created doing the most amazing stuff as well working on these amazing this amazing stuff it's like if you told me at the time when I did it be like no just go book her off yeah just yeah it's like no but yeah I was like it it like it's surreal is all I can say it's completely surreal okay so you hit some sort of bomber Peak you were programming and you're building this thing and then obviously yeah that's I I have a pure experience from it so yeah and then you you obviously fell asleep or whatever and you woke up the next day maybe a little hungover at what point did you think this is actually a real thing like what cued you into taking Odin from a drunk evening of power programming into a real project because those are very different experiences I kept got in it just for a month um and then after a month I went you know what this could be viable I've only spent a month and I've got D I can use it usable language this is as good as C at the time I went maybe I should work on this as a hobby and just as a hobby initially it was so because at the time I think I was working at surprising I was using web server back and stuff I was working at GoDaddy at the time I think oh GoDaddy I heard that place is awful no don't talk about yourself as a company but it was on the English side so okay different size and it's quite a nice company um little short uh how do I claim to fame if you've ever seen domain connect records in your domain names uh I'm to blame sorry nice nice I think that's my problem if I'm not mistaken I think uh primagen.tv I registered at GoDaddy because I couldn't there's very few services that can register a DOT TV name and I went through a few of them as I find things quite expensive that's why to register it that's why many of them don't do it yeah anyways that's that's where I ended up at so okay this is great I can't believe this this is fantastic well look at that um hey I really do appreciate you coming on here I really appreciate you thank you for helping me seriously I will say that this is a very unusual thing that happens in our modern world which is I went on in front of however many thousands of people and said Odin language dog water and your response was let me show you it's not dog water as opposed to being like this guy's a [ __ ] on Twitter yeah awesome loved it there is one thing I okay this is true there is one thing I really do like to do with guests can you please give me one hot take one hot take of yours that you feel is fairly spicy hot tape in respects to programming so like here here you go here's mine I'll just toss one out there for you okay please do uh tdd is trash and then now I'd go on and explain my positioning why I think yeah so do you have one in which you're like okay here's one that's if people hear it either they're gonna love you or hate it hate you for it I know that's the problem I'm gonna have to say it I could no I'm not gonna do a joke um I can do joke one that's the problem obviously I'm trying to think of a really serious one uh don't think you're clever yeah I know it sounds like okay I'll explain what I mean don't think you're clever do something dumb really dumb really right and if you're thinking enough but don't be zealoting as well so I mean that's what I mean don't say oh I want everyone should use rust everyone should use the best language whatever Mike shut up I think you're just an idiot when you say that I'm the idiots they're not you particularly today or anything like that just literally people go like oh everyone should be using this thing I'm like shut up you look like an idiot you don't know what you're talking about okay I'm not hurt don't worry I'm not real stupid I'm just not roast it could be any language I mean literally any language yeah yeah like but I know that's gonna be clipped out now I'm like yeah um me making a sad face uh actually that would be great short that actually just might become a short you never know right flip if you're watching that short short material right here yeah just say don't don't don't whatever yeah no ripped that was good uh that's pretty good okay I like that ask for a hot take leave a little sad you know you know the thing is is that I had to be on the other side of a hot pick eventually you know it's only bound to happen um all right I now know what a Florida man feels like so thank you very much for being on here I really appreciate it uh we should definitely one of these days I'll try to build something in Odin if I can find the time and I'll shoot it over to you and maybe you can you know trash my code and be like here's the real way you should have done it sure if you'd like yeah happy how up to it all right awesome well thank you very much Ginger Bill take care I'm gonna I'm gonna ping uh your Twitter one more time anyone tweet at him if you have any questions I'll answer them all night don't worry yeah I forget you're kind of on the evening schedule now so yeah yeah it's fun all right take care okay bye bye
