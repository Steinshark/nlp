Mac users got a major update recently Mac OS Ventura named after the place in California not the pro wrestler who dabbled in politics since this is a full-blown new version of macwest instead of an update to an existing one there are a lot of changes many of which are pretty cool and one that's already proven to be very divisive but before we get into all the changes it helps to know if you can even run it most MacBooks and iMacs from 2017 and onward are compatible though if you have a MacBook Air you'll need something from at least 2018 Mac minis from 2018 will also work as well as the new Mac Studio naturally let's start out by talking about a hardware Improvement that Ventura offers it's a feature called continuity camera if you're unhappy with the quality of your webcam built into the Mac continuity camera connects to your iPhone and lets you use its far better camera instead it also enables a cool feature called desk view which uses the iPhone's telephoto camera to create a top-down view of your desk if you have something to share during a video call but surprise these will only work if you have an iPhone 10r or newer speaking of video calls another feature called FaceTime handoff can seamlessly switch a FaceTime call from your iPhone to your Mac without having to hang up useful if you like to sit down at your computer for longer calls but let's switch gears now and talk about some features that might remind you a bit of other certain platforms that Apple competes with there's a change coming to iCloud called the shared photo library which allows you to share photos and videos with up to five other people who can also contribute to the shared Library kind of like the shared folders feature in Google photos still it's a great feature next there's a UI enhancement called stage manager which was previously an iPad only feature instead of having to dig through the dock at the bottom of the screen when switching programs or Windows stage manager keeps small previews of everything you have open on the left side of your screen although this is kind of like the alt tab live previews of getting Windows 11 stage manager feature teachers smaller previews that just persistently stay in a column on the left side of your screen so you don't have to switch out of whatever it is you're doing in order to see what's open at a glance Apple has also improved the spotlight feature which is their combined system and web search feature the format has been tweaked to give more information for a given search but perhaps more notably you can now use quick look in Spotlight allowing you to do a quick peek of a search result like a YouTube video or a file on your local drive just by hitting spacebar cool stuff but there's another major change that while meant to be more useful is already ruffling feathers we'll tell you what it is right after we think our sponsor Mexico if you're working from home and are in need of a new webcam Mexico has a wide variety to choose from to keep you looking sharp on your conference calls whether you're on a budget and need high quality video or you just want the best possible webcam regardless of the price their

next level and get a next ago webcam using the link down below the system preferences app has been reinvented as system settings which looks a lot more like the settings app in Windows in that you have a big list of categories on left side and actual settings to toggle on the right previously system preferences was more like the windows control panel so the change does make tweaking your computer feel more like a modern experience if you will however one big gripe users have is that it seems to be based off the iOS Settings app which doesn't translate perfectly to a desktop environment users are frustrated with the massive amount of empty space as well as the fact that many common settings have been moved around making them tough to find for long time Mac users it's like someone just comes in your house and rearranges your furniture for no reason but there are a slew of other changes that are less controversial yet still worth mentioning if you've bought further into the Apple ecosystem with airpods you'll now have full control over them in Ventura whereas previously settings like double tap and noise control were unavailable on desktop the mail app is also getting a Gmail like cancel send feature so that's a godsend there's finally a full-blown weather app and you even get lockdown mode which restricts programs and connected devices if you think you're at risk of being attacked and for gamers Apple's new metal 3 API is supposed to more effectively use the GPU on Apple silicon ships which will hopefully entice more developers to release games for Mac Resident Evil Village has already gotten a Mac release partly as a result and no man's Sky should be coming soon and while these games aren't super bleeding edge it's exciting news for folks who have
