[Music] all right welcome back to tech intern guys so today we're going to be doing is taking a look at one of the projects i created when i was in university and that is spotify to youtube mp3 so basically using spotify to download all of the songs from youtube now uh in order to do that we're going to have to understand oauth and we're going to have to interact with the spotify api so in the very beginning here i just want to explain how oauth works and i want to explain um how we are going to interact with the spotify api now the great thing about this is that we're going to use this for basically any application we want to interact with if you want to use google or facebook you know if you've ever seen those sign in with facebook sign in with google if you want to implement one of those in your app it's going to be the exact same principles so today we're just going to really quickly learn all of that and you'll never have to worry about that ever again so let's get into it okay so the first difference we have to think about when we talk about oauth the difference between authentication and authorization so authentication is when you log in with the username or password this is you proving who you are so you're saying to facebook or spotify for example hey my name is jason and let me listen to my songs now let's say in your application you wanted to uh you know interact with with spotify on behalf of the user well you could ask them for their username and password so that you could log in for them but that's not safe that's not sustainable and nobody is going to trust you with your user their username and password however if you do ask for their username and password you can log in on behalf of them and one way that you could do this is with selenium so if you check out our channel you'll see another video where we do this method to get information from instagram and we log in with instagram and we go and grab all this data the reason we do it that way is because the instagram api doesn't give you access to certain information and the only way to to get access to that information is through authentication the other option is authorization so the difference here is you're not proving that you are jason for example you're not proving that you are a user you're saying hey here is proof that the user is giving me access to this data so you're saying hey like i am not this person i am a service i'm an app however i know that the person that you know i know this person i know jason wants me to get access to this information so for that we're gonna use oauth this is kind of a general breakdown of how this is going to work so here we've got the user which is me a really flattering picture of me we've got my app which i've labeled tech and turn which is the name of this channel and we've got spotify it's the very first thing let's say i'm i'm the user right i want this application to get access to my songs on spotify so i log into the app and i say hey access my songs so my app will contact spotify and say say jason told me i could access his songs now spotify doesn't trust my app right spotify trusts the user so spotify is going to ask the user did you tell my app this this app that uh it could access your songs and then the user which is uh you know this flattering picture of me is going to say back yes and so spotify is then going to reply to my app okay i i know that jason does want you to access those songs i verified that myself here is an access code uh and this is kind of the screen that the user will get when they during this whole interaction here step three and four this is the the thing they're gonna get connect the app to your spotify account then there's gonna be a description of the app and what data the app wants to access uh you can see that here the app will be able to receive this account data this is what they have in their spotify api documentation basically here is your app here's the spotify account service and this is the user and it's kind of the flow we just talked about with with more words but we're gonna go through this in code but yeah so basically you just uh you send the user to the spotify you send the user to the spotify service they log in and then the user gets redirected back to you with some with an access code you swap out the access code for um for a token for an access token and then you can use that access token to make uh requests now don't worry if i mean if this thing seems a little overwhelming which it was for me which is why i created this because this is way way easier to understand this seems a little confusing we're going to go through it in code and you're going to realize it's really not that confusing but there's some definitions you should know first scope this is what i get access to user playlists email basically just account data right redirect uri uh we'll talk more about that in the next slide client id this is just the unique id for your app think of it as your app's username and your client secret well this is just a private secret for your app think of it as your app password i mean your app has to have credentials too right okay so now we're going to understand the redirect uri so think about this the user is connected to my app all right and when we need them to interact with spotify to tell spotify that we should get access to information we redirect them to spotify servers so now the user is no longer on our app they're on spotify spotify and the user talk you know they say hey should should my app get access to this the user is going to say yes and then spotify is going to send the user back to my app they're going to redirect the user back to my app so the reason that we have this redirect uri is so that spotify knows where to send the user back to so this is an example of how we're going to use the spotify application and look it's got those four parameters client id and client secret we're going to be given those when we create an application the redirect uri this is where spotify is going to send the user back to after they approve and the scope this is what i want to get access to and that's it like that's basically all there is to oauth uh for our purposes and it's really not that difficult so um that's all i have for this first episode and in the next episode what we'll do is we'll start setting up our python project with flask uh to actually you know build a server because we need to create an end point here this redirect uri we need an endpoint so we're gonna use flask to create this endpoint and we're gonna go through the whole oauth flow and we're gonna get access to the user's library so that's it for part one uh thank you guys for watching
