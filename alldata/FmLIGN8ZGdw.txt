I'm going to talk about Zeta regularization and uh values of the remon zeta function at negative integers okay where do we stop so I think it begins with contemplating what we call infinite series these would be getting numbers uh which you have to construct through some infinite process so for example kind of famous one is you take a number which is like 99999 repeating so the NES will keep on going forever and you ask yourself like is this a number that I kind of already recognize is equal to something else with a different name and in this case all the way from this perspective the decimal expansion is very complicated it's actually equal to one one way to try and like convince yourself that this must be the value is if you take this thing here let's call it like X let's say we don't know what it's equal to but if I take this X and I multiply it by 10 well we know multiplying by 10 just kind of shifts each decimal point like one one thing to the right so I'm going to get like 99.999 repeating this thing looks a lot like the X right the X was like .999 0.999 and so the only thing that's different about X and 10 x is this 9 in front so let's say I subtract the X from the 10 x okay so I get 10 x - x and now I just get 9 because now everything else kind of cancels out here when I do subtraction so here I'm getting 9x = 9 and I've concluded therefore that X should be equal to one I feel like I've been tricked when I say that like there's been slight of hand or something Miss I felt the same way yeah when I kind of first saw this I mean part of it is just to you have to sort of decide what what do you really mean when you say equal what do you mean but when you think about like infinite decimal expansions and in math there's a kind of formalism for this called convergence and it's like if you have a number like this where you kind of keep uh adding very very small things to it like 0.9 plus 9 plus and so on then if it's getting closer and closer uh to to some Target value then we're just going to say it is equal to that Target value so there is a there's a kind of a framework of analysis here that which we're kind of suppressing uh which really justifies like why you're allowed to say these kinds of equalities but that's is that a bit lazy though if I went to the Olympics and I was running towards the Finish Line as I get closer and closer I still haven't reached the finish line I'm not going to get the gold medal until I cross it just like 0.99999 isn't going to get its Oneness until it crosses the finish line and it doesn't cross the finish line so I think uh this concept of infinity is kind of a mathematical maybe abstraction to some extent like in our daily lives we rarely encounter a proc which is truly infinite where you can really just keep going forever forever forever and so um so it's a bit of an abstraction that it's introduced for introduced for kind of mathematical convenience like it makes things work this kind of thing is counterintuitive because in kind of real life we don't necessarily encounter infinite processes so I'm going to show you another example where you can apply similar reasoning but uh it can lead you astray so let's do something like 1 + 10 + 100 + 1,00 and I think you see where I'm going I'm just going to keep adding a number which gets uh one more zero at the end so now this is very much not converging in the previous case when we did this 0.999 thing you kept adding something smaller and smaller and you're getting closer and closer to the Target value here we're adding something bigger and bigger and bigger we're kind of uh not getting closer to anything it's blowing up blowing up exactly however you could try to carry out the same sort of reasoning to say well suppose suppose this was a number x uh then what would 10 XP well you would get 10 right 10 * 1 is 10 plus 10 * 10 is 100 + 10 * 100 is a th000 and so on so it actually looks exactly the same as X except that it's missing a one so you could try to say well therefore 10 x is actually really just equal to X except it's missing a one so let's call it x - one uh and then we would manipulate here so I could move this x to the other side so I'd get 9x is1 uh and the conclusion would be that x is1 9 so that big blow up thing now yeah yeah right so this doesn't really look right right because it one is positive 10 is positive 100 is positive you know when you add positive numbers to positive numbers it's still positive and in fact it's getting more and more positive it's getting larger and larger and larger in the positive direction how could it end up being Nega 1 over9 what is the problem you did the same thing last time and we were comfortable what's different this time right right so what's different this time is kind of in the sense that I said last time you're allowed to take this infinite expression and assign to it a value and then you can perform this reasion to figure out what the value is so this is some value the value turn out to be one in this case this infinite sum doesn't actually have a an official value it's not allowed to have a value so when you try to analyze what that value is you're going to get gibberish because it's not uh it's just not it's not true that this is equal to some number so the whole the whole the problem started the minute you said x equals yeah I said x equals this and I was trying to to work with X as if it's a number like any other number but that's not really allowed but there is uh there is something legit here so I think that's you know that's part of math is that um sometimes you find something and it's not technically in the rule book that already exists it's part of the research process is to figure out like to what extent is it Justified or what maybe it's a shadow of something which is actually allow I like that a shadow of something that's allowed a lot of times like people ask like what is math research it about and it it's very sometimes it's this kind of doodling where you do something you say well this isn't real allowed but seems like it would be 1 1 nth and what is the meaning of that so the meaning of that here falls under some topic which we call analytic continuation and the idea will be I can take uh an expression let's try to kind of generalize these two things so I'll I'll take something like one + r + r 2 plus R cubed and so on this thing will will'll have some value X if R is less than one an absolute value so in this theory of infinite sums and convergence this thing will be a number if this absolute value of R is less than one because it won't blow up because it won't blow up exactly because this if R is less than one when you raise it to higher and higher Powers it will shrink to zero so you're adding very little at each stage so it's going to kind of reach some Target and it turns out that this will be equal to 1 over 1 - R to see this you can play the same gam as we did before you can say well I'll take R * X you know and that'll be r + r 2 + R cubed plus so on and that's the same as X except that this one right is uh is present in X and it's not present in R * X so uh what we see is that this is equal to X - 1 and then if we kind of shift things around to you know side divide by the r - one we're going to get we're going to get the conclusion that X is equal to 1 1 - [Music] R okay so what we just discussed was that um I have this thing 1 + r + r 2 plus so on an infinite sum and actually equals this kind of more finitary expression 1 over 1 - R if the absolute V of R is less than one this left side although I said it's not it's not really a number if R is bigger than one it's not allowed to be assigned some specific value because it doesn't converge um the right side you see this 1 1 - R makes a lot of sense even if R is something like 10 or 100 something bigger than one so the way we think about this is that these two sides they're equal on some part of the number line right if R is like between 1 and one then these two numbers will be equal say R is in here but then if R is bigger than one then only one of them makes sense so this is this analytic continuation that I referring to where we think of it as like in order to make sense of this value when uh a prior it's not allowed like you're not allowed to take the sum when R is bigger than one you need to find some other way to express it and that other way may there then make sense even when kind of the input R is not in the original domain of definition okay that's just thing that we call Anal continuation it's like you have a thing and you need to find some other way to another perspective on it which makes sense um in a kind of broader context if you had a name right like your name's Tony yes but if you had a name with an infinite number of letters uhhuh I couldn't write your name so I don't know what to call you so someone says to me all right call him call him Tony cuz that's got a finite number of letters and your brain can handle that yeah that's all well and good and it helps you and I communicate and for me to call to you from across the room but it's still not your name like I still haven't said your name mhm isn't that the problem here like we we've assigned a value to this series but it's still not the value so that that's maybe a bit more philosophical but I would say going back to this this example 999 and what do we mean when we say this is equal to one and you could say like so I I think what you're saying this analogy is like well this isn't really one because one is one and this is not one so it's something else but what we're trying to do here is is create a formalism where this kind of thing uh 0.99999 instead of saying oh it's an infinite number not a not an actual number but like some something close to a number we're just going to we want to think of it as an actual number and I'm saying it really is equal to one so I think the analogy it would be more like you maybe in one language my name would be Tony in another language it would might be like Tony Tony Tony Tony repeat it infinitely but we would recognize is really we're talking about the same thing just they happen to have different names you could call them different things but really they are the same does every series that you can conceive of have a unique identity under analytic continuation or could two or three different series identify themselves by uh you know minus a half or something like that um you could definitely arrive at the same value with two different uh kind of appearances for example this is one where I could say one is really 1.00 and the zero repeats and that's that's going to be the same as this uh you can also have examples of these infinite uh series which just don't have any other name that we recognize and one is one of them is like um you know 3.14159 so I'm getting at pi here so this is not there's not a simple way to write this you know as like 22 over 7 I mean that's an approximation but there's no there's no such thing like that so it's not necessarily the case that every series has some nice value that we already had some other name for there are some people watching this some number five viewers that are thinking very much about the sum of the integers at the moment I know this looks like a bit of mathematical Hocus Pocus sort of thing but actually in truth it's not and I'll tell you why we know it's not that is where I want to go next so um there's there are certain kinds of sequences sort of like this 1 + 10 plus 100 but and so on but a little more complicated which have some historical significance and also modern mathematical significant so that's what going to talk about next so I just want to uh recap we decided that this kind of Thing 1 + 10 plus 100 plus 1,000 and so on it's not really equal to a number but we can say in quotes is equal to 1 9 and what we mean when we say this is that there is another way to think about this thing uh like here it's kind of this thing when R is 10 we can think of that instead as 1 over 1 - R and that's what we are what we mean when we say this kind of equality so there is a function of r and that function uh can be extended to a region where it has a different appearance but it still makes sense and it still has nice properties and then you can plug R into that and and get a well- defined uh number and so here we're saying this 1 plus 10 plus 100 that's really the specialization uh when R is 10 of the left side and then this left side is equal to some other function which makes sense even when R is something like 10 even though this equality was originally when when R is less than one so I'm going to do another example in the spirit but uh it's slightly different and it shows another one of these dangers of um doodling without uh without any rules so if we take this sum 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - one continuing with alternating signs suppose that this thing were to have a value What would value B so you could say why don't I group up this sum like this break this into groups of two so 1 - 1 and then I add 1 - one and I add 1 - one and so on so here this is of course 1 - 1 is 0 0 0 so I'm adding zero to itself bunch of times so it should be equal to zero question mark But if I look at it a slightly different way suppose I just group these things differently start with this one when we do the subtraction of one and the addition of one in one step so then I do 1 - 1 + 1 and then I subtract one and I add one and I keep doing this so now I'm going to get zero here I'm also going to get zero i' I've just get a different argument that it's 1 - 0 - 0 blah blah blah and that would be one because you're you're starting with one you're doing nothing to it so it seems like we've given different arguments that this should have these two different values 01 what what's going on here so this is one of the dangers of kind of manipulating the infinite sums uh without any rules so that's what in math we have rules about what's really allowed and what's not allowed um sometimes we break those rules in order to try and guess uh what what sort of things out there that we haven't discovered yet but uh in the end we need to justify things with rules and here both of these computations they're not really Justified because of this issue that this thing isn't converging it's really like oscillating it's like starts at one goes to zero and then one and zero and so on so the way to justify what the value really should be is to say well this thing here is again the specializ ation um of this kind of expression when R is Nega 1 so when R is negative 1 this 1 + r plus r s and so on will be this expression here with alternating signs and our recipe is telling us that we should think of it as 1 over 1 minus 1 so that's 1 / two so in fact the correct way to regularize this kind of infinite sum uh at least in this kind of context is going to produce the answer of 1/2 how much is it halfway between the two you exactly yeah it's halfway between these two extremes is that just a coincidence that's halfway between the two extremes or um it would certainly have to be between these two extremes but uh there's definitely no rule like oh it'll always be you know half of the if you have two different answers it'll be the average of them there's no rule like that okay so now I'm going to discuss um a slightly more complicated example which is related to things that uh mathematicians these days care a lot about and it also has some historical significance so I'm going to consider a sum that looks like this 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 plus and so on and this like the other ones we've seen is certainly not converging you're adding numbers that increments are are bigger and bigger so they're not kind of converging to some specific Target nevertheless it's it's actually interesting to think about when we have this expression if we were to assign to it some numeric value what would that value be and then at the end also how can we justify it how are we going to analyze this so I'm going to do something which is mathematical doodling where we're going to do some operations we're going to not worry so much at first at least that we're breaking some rules like assigning this numeric value and uh then we're going to try and justify the conclusion later if I look at this thing here suppose I contemplate -4x so I can calculate what this is but I want to position it in a certain way so I'm going to think of it as -4 * this 1 and then I have to add -4 * this 2 but I'm going to put that over here so I'm sort of doing things in steps of two here so minus 12 and so on uh and the point of it writing it this way is that now if I add the X and the -4x on one side I'm going to get of course -3x but then the other side I'm going to get 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 and so on so it'll be the kind of alternating sign version of the original X now I'm going to do something kind of similar again where I just say well -3x is and now I'm going to shift the positioning by one so it's like 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 and so on so I'm I'm writing the same expression but just shifted over by one and the reason I did that is because then I'm going to add these things I'm going to get -6x and it's going to be equal to this 1 - one + 1 - one and so on did you break any rules by doing that little shift moving them over that was just for visual reasons wasn't that was just a help yeah yeah the shifting it shouldn't do anything right because it's the same expression I mean the adding and subtract doesn't the positioning doesn't really matter of course I I broke rules when I wrote the equal sign and I was treating X as a number um so this is all on kind of shaky grounds but this is the kind of doodling which was done by a mathematician from the 1700s named Oiler and and it turns out that it does produce the correct conclusion um so it's it's kind of interesting but we have to of course in math we have to go back and justify like why why is it okay all right so minus 6X gives us something we're familiar with you showed us we saw that yeah exactly we saw it earlier we saw that this is 1/2 and so conclusion is that X is actually 1 over2 sold except for that naughty thing at the start right right so what does this kind of conclusion actually mean uh how is what how does it Justified and and sort of what is the significance of [Applause] [Music] that so earlier on we were talking about this function 1 + r + r 2 plus r cub and so on as a function of r and then we said wait as a function of r it's equal to 1 1 - R uh at least when R is less than one in absolute value and it's 1 over 1 minus r actually that has fewer restrictions on what you can plug in for R you can plug in any R that's not equal to one you get a sensible answer so similarly here there's this thing called the remon zeta function so it's a function of a variable s and it's 1/ 1 to the S + 1 2 to the S + 1 3 to the s S Plus 1 4 to the S and so on so you're going to see every uh positive counting number here so the way we would write this in shorthand is sum overall n of 1/ n the S we need to ask ourselves like where does this expression actually make sense and it's only going to make sense when s is big enough because you need to make sure that you're adding very very small increments in order to get this quantity to kind of converge to a to a fixed value so it turns out that this is okay if s is bigger than one mathematicians care about this ruman zeta function because because its properties are actually closely intertwined with the distribution of prime numbers um so if you've heard of the REM hypothesis one of the kind of longest outstanding uh conectors in mathematics then um it's about the the properties of this function cool so that's a big deal it's a big deal yeah so I said this makes sense if s is bigger than one so for example there's kind of famously Zeta of 2 you can plug in S = 2 and here you're going to get pi^ 2 over 6 if s isn't than one the problem is what your your denominators become less than one and therefore the numbers become the actual numbers become bigger the integers become bigger and just turns into this Whopper again exactly yes so when you have these infinite sums in order for that to have a well- defined Target value then the increment that you're adding each time has to get small quickly enough but actually when s is less than one the increment the increments are not small enough and so for example if s is -1 then what you would see in this expression is something like Z of1 you know you tried to say it's equal to I'm going to put this in quotes um because now you think it's a negative sign so it's really 1 + uh 2 + 3 + 4 there it is this expression that we saw before that uh we said should be equal to um -12 cool it's a similar story to here where this Zeta of s I've defined it in a way that sort of only makes sense when s is bigger than one but you can produce some other description of it which makes sense uh actually when s is less than one as well as long as s is not equal to one then it it it will have a well-defined target number say Z of s makes sense as long as s is not equal to one this makes sense means there's some analytic continuation of it so there's some other perspective on this definition that you're allowed to plug in uh for example negative 1 and two and it is true that Z of1 is12 is that arriving at -12th using a significantly different technique like is it quite the the doodling technique you showed me which you said was on slightly Shaky Ground is the technique that you would use this second way different is it I think the doodling you can make it legit uh so I there's different ways to approach this but the doodling can be turned into a real proof but there there's certain doodlings which I didn't show which would could lead you to the wrong conclusion so you be careful about those those cannot be so it's a bit of a fine line at the end um you you definitely have to do more work to justify it but basically the doodling is uh is part of maybe like it's the tip of Iceberg on some actual mathematically rigorous approach so if someone tells you that the sum of all the positive integers all of them to Infinity whatever that means is minus a 12th what do you say what do you say to them do you say yeah oh I'm cool with that um well my first instinct would be like you know what are you talking about it's obviously ridiculous um but I guess after studying the theory then you know then you sort of think like I know what you really mean but I'll just say it's kind of funny anecdote which I think is um somewhat convincing is that sometimes uh you're doing some actual calculation like in physics there's this thing called the Casmir effect in quantum mechanics and you're trying to you know you're trying to predict some experimental outcome and uh you're trying to calculate the energy and you run into this kind of thing you say like oh seems like the physics is telling me the energy is something like 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus four and so on um and so of course that doesn't make sense um but then you say okay so maybe the correct way to make sense of it is in this sense of the zeta function this is called Zeta regularization where it's a kind of procedure by which when I see certain types of Infinities that look like this kind of thing I'm going to replace them by the value of the zeta function and it turns out that this this leads to kind of an experimentally verifiable outcome so um you could have the point of view that like when you see these kinds of Infinities uh it's Nature's Way of really telling you that you know it should be this other kind of negative 112 thing okay I just wanted to give a little bit of extra context and information about today's video cuz as you may be aware we've covered the issue of minus a 12th before pretty much exactly 10 years ago now when I was in Berkeley and met up with Tony who was in today's video I didn't know what he wanted to talk about and he hadn't watched all the number five videos he didn't know we'd covered a minus 12th before when I realized what he was going to be talking about I thought it might be an interesting experiment to hear someone else explain the whole concept and Tony was cool with that so he hadn't seen the previous video and I thought it might be interesting for you to watch this and compare it with what's been said before now going back to the original video 10 years ago one of the people in that video also called Tony was Tony Padilla and he's been interested in a minus a 12 ever since it's followed him around and recently him and a collaborator have written a new paper all about it about how it links in with physics how minus a 12th could be a shield nature uses to protect us from Infinity if you'd like to hear more about that I've uploaded that video newly to number file as well I'll include a link in the description and I'll also include a link to a playlist to all our minus or 12 videos knock yourselves out it's because of that sharp transition it says you don't have to do it like that that's not there are other ways to regulate this sum now I'm not doing anything weird no weird analytic continuation anything like that ter to says there are other ways to regulate some don't do the sharp transition do a smoother one something that takes you between one and zero in a much smoother way it's blowing up you get larger and larger so there is no sense of being getting closer to to anything so traditionally what do we do with the Divergent series we just ignore our we just ignore them we just throw them away uh but the question is whether this is the right approach whether there is actually something we can say about such a series
