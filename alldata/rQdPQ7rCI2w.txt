welcome to today's stream which is going to be about hiring in C plus plus and what many C plus plus offers about this and we mostly going to talk about the job fair which is in November at the end of November we have an extra Fair on 29th to 30th um so let me get to my smarts and so um just before we get started I know like why meeting C plus plus just want to point it out at the beginning uh I do have a reach into the community which is huge um and it was not over 26 500 followers on um LinkedIn Twitter has like 28 000 and there's Facebook which you know still some people there um and that's an untapped possibility for companies to you know to access as uh candidates and says to be visible in the community and um so a few HR department is asking why a meeting C plus plus that's one of the reasons uh visibility and I reached a lot of folks you know with all those folks which follow meaning C plus plus of course are self uh followed you know they made the decision to follow foreign then from the other side when I hear from the HR departments and companies and people which have to do with hiring on C plus plus I always hear that c plus devs are hard to find and so you know I've been hearing it for years literally and makes you wonder why first I think that everyone is looking as one of the problems or one of the you know reasons because it's not hard to find a C plus plus job as a deaf when everyone is looking right um and then there is just the whole mechanism how recruiting Works in our time uh that everyone gets spammed even if you're not looking and alienates the rest of us and makes recruiters not being very popular within our community and I think generally within the Tech Community itself that's not specific to C plus plus because you know they you know they always claim to have looked at your profile and you have you are the perfect candidate and um in this example like in my profile I it's literally standing that I'm not looking for jobs in German so no they they didn't and I know that on LinkedIn some people put like uh um and emoticon or some smarty until there um name to know if that person type the name or does it was copy pasted from some script and yes I also got misgendered this year from some that wasn't automated but yeah so happening to women way more especially if there's automated messages and those automated messages often don't really look on gender um another example what happened to me a few years ago is like when you attend your product status or when you changed your status or add new things to your profile search agents are triggered and certain recruiters are notified that you you know added products on looking to your profile and in the reality it was not looking for projects so I got some offers after that which kind of annoyed me um and I wondered how this is in the community so I did a Twitter survey last year um if it was about a year ago if people that are not looking for your job still have been you know contacted by recruiters and how how many recruiters was in the last three months and this is the results um so most people have not been but then the majority of people have been um than the survey um I did the survey in spring in this year and same question same but different results you know spring it was way more people that are being contacted and very very more recurs also so this is a persistent problem now for years and of course if you ask on LinkedIn it's even more persistent and the trend from Twitter already known um has been uh you know not not so new right and on LinkedIn also carried forward um and I guess not none of that is surprising the two folks which have been on the tech World for for some time right um so when I started two years ago my online user group I thought maybe we should try a different approach and so came the job fair to basically um use the reach I have on the commute and if companies were willing to be at that event access to this reach and give people who are looking for a job the opportunity to come by say hi go to a table and talk to the recruiters OR tech people from that company and get a feeling and that way it's kind of mutual right um and in this year we have had four editions already and we have a first one uh we had an unplanned Edition in June because some companies missed the May edition and they wanted to have a summer edition um and the current one I already mentioned this month in the end 29th 30th November we will have the last drop fair and this year um oh and yeah so plans for next year but especially also for the next Edition um I want to enhance the Fair events with starting with a live streams where employers can introduce um themselves with a short like you know overview or something which I want to say five five minutes per employer or depends on on the time and the number of employers we have at the event that also serves the uh purpose of you know getting a bigger audience to the event and also being able that I can introduce the event platform to the audience uh because um you know the ideal thing is that you're going to the event to find a job so there's from the job searching audience very very few people which are recurrent and which already knew the concept so I should add something to introduce people and um I do want to go also more into the direction of employer branding um so coming to the job fair of course as part of that but I feel like you know and I probably wants to have their own live stream on LinkedIn or Facebook um that would be possible by next you also should mention the sponsorship of the user group meeting which is possible and there's of course other ideas which I have or maybe you as a company have to to present yourself on meeting C plus plus I'm open to those um and this brings me to the CV sharing form this is the other component which is important to the um to the event um the CV sharing form captures the attendees which are coming to the event party but especially it captures the folks which are not able to come and it's always online and if your sponsor the job fair if you're there as as a full member in the job fair uh you are being listed on this phone for six months from the time of your order um and so this form um gives a light candidate profit on the first page um this is letting the candidate choose where they're coming from which is like continent it's very you know abstract but the next page like let's improve the country in the country choose their relocation remote options there sequence bus skills which is like you know zero standards Frameworks build uh Technologies Etc um field of work where they have we worked in which Fields you know it's kind of explanatory and use of experience and this also gives me on the other hand an aggregate from all the candidates right um so quickly go back to the site and say on the next page of this form the candidate then we'll choose uh the companies they want to share their suvi Swift and upload their CV edit but we'll get to that um so this is an aggregate which gives me then um also make feedback from from this year it's a bit of a chicken neck problem if I do not have companies from a country I have less candidates from that country usually one big exception is India we always have a lot of in interest from Asia in general because you can see there's packets from the status last year the Aggregate and it looks similar for most events this year and then there's always like some you know countries which pop up at one event which like I think at the last event in October we had the first submission from Japan and we have sometimes submissions from Africa which are also kind of you know a lot of countries in Africa and not a lot of developers will be reached out there and um so this is a markup of the countries where we have submissions from it's fairly International but it has a strong focus on Asia and Europe um this is kind of what this Goods look like last year uh C plus 11 14 Linux object orientation modern C plus plus and C plus 17 are usually among the group which are in the overall population the most uh known things and then there's other things like you know which are also important but not everybody knows them or is like putting that uh on the on their selection there's like boost uh seem like got a lot more popular this year so you actually probably will see you in a minute um Frozen fields of Works um no big surprise the other desktop is very uh very popular I added a few in this year so that uh other is not as high as it was last year um and then there's also this is like has a big big influence on the companies if you have a lot of companies from Finance we have more Finance uh gaming companies we had King last time so gaming is up and this year through that um years of experience um we always have a lot of candidates which are starting out which are finding there the first second or third job in the industry and then we have folks which may are still on their second or third job or first job but are like over 10 years in the industry and it's kind of split in half if you kind of you know see that a little bit more like 60 40 maybe to the to the uh Fox attacks not stuck around in 10 years for a decade in our industry um and this creates a light candidate profile for you as a company right something to look at something uh companies May filter for like International candidates are interesting to you um that that is an option to just say we are in North America we only want to see North American candidates or that's up to you um the next step for the company candidate which I also mentioned is select the companies to share with upload the CB resume and uh add a general cover letter not everybody does it but it's that kind of optional um and this is some numbers on on the candidates itself [Music] um with on the right of the last event was 66 submissions through the form and so you know you kind of keep it equally over 50 and then we have the next two is a prior quarter and second quarter in this year where we had two events and they kind of you know start cannibalizing each other for candidates uh because they're like back to back like May June and so that's why the numbers are down in that field and um then we see the first event this year March it's always very popular with companies because you know it's it's new in the year and folks are looking for jobs and companies offering jobs and so um this is kind of how um the setup has been over the years and the other high pandas September event from last year um and as I already said like the the mix of companies which and how many companies are attending is always a big influence on um of the audience showing up right um here we see the first event from this year versus uh overall um aggregate of last year and we see the secret for 17 this year has become more popular and see makers become more popular than it was in the prior year um you know since tmac wasn't in all the events available as an option I've added a lot of options in the last year but this year I did not add as many because most are covered now which brings me to the event itself okay so the event offers sponsored and free tables um sponsored tables offer you most what I talked about um you are being listed on the website in the CV sharing form for six months on the website which is there's a logo and the listing um on the job fair page itself and of course your logo also then will be in the drop section for six months um and I will give you some space to introduce your company in the live stream uh you have access to the recruiting tool in which we'll talk later about um and it enables me to advertise the event right if I have logos to to show to people and say hey this is this company do you know them um makes people more interested in the event in my network um and of course I'm always happy to hear feedback from those companies that actually you know sponsored the event and made this possible to work on this and um this has you know driven a lot of the tooling that you see now in the past um I want to give companies also a chance to kind of you know get used to this so there are free tables um they are below the sponsored tables in the event so they get less traffic they have less visibility um therefore getting for a few for the event format they're limited to two visits and their smaller table over like you know if we have an eight percent table for the sponsors normally or for sponsor type depends on how many sponsors we have then your table will be smaller and you'll you'll list it below um I quickly also want to answer what the table is this is always being a very popular question um because it's virtual right how can a table exists so this is like a lounge uh like um UI where you can see like the tables and cultures of various things and we can add your logo to this table um the table has seats and as soon as two people sit on the same table The View you see here will disappear and you will go on a meeting mode and you will be in a video conference with that person you will be able to share slides Etc everything that you kind of use from a video conference will work on this environment um these meetings start when a second person person has joined your table um and they're limited by who below to one hour so that our ends then you should read on your table and as a candidate that's is also kind of a mechanism to redistribute candidates right not to have them sitting at one employer all the time because they like their conversation but maybe then they they get reminded that they should go to to some other employer um and yeah everyone is able to join a table even if this meeting is going on which you can see you can see kind of this this modish gibberish above the um tables that's the time which is left for the meeting um that's unfortunately something which I cannot turn off so it's just what we have to do first um and this is a table this is how the event works for three hours and I already mentioned the recruiting tooling which I have uh you know implemented on my website if you go into recruiting um and you register for the event you will see those graphs which are specifically about the people which submit it to you and as an event can have many people submit to you I've offer kind of a tooling to have give to give you access to it should mention that every candidate that submits to you and selects you as a company you also get made as the CV and a lot of companies prefer that they are like oh okay and then they have their own tooling and I just do this to you know to give you the graphs and to give you an overview on what has submitted has been submitted um there's also a search and a text search where you can find like candidates at selected cubes right we have really like 40 to 50 candidates submitting to you as a company sometimes and I want people to be able to search for certain positions if they you know know this position I mean it's cute or they have another submit submission for uh a position in which needs an embedded job stuff like that they kind of kind of find the candidates from your pool at me C plus plus that fits that position you have currently and also for for smaller companies that's not as useful but for for bigger companies that this is a very useful thing um and as I mentioned the job fair is a long time project it needs always the employer support and if you sign up early it helps me a lot with Distributing the knowledge about the event who is there and um helps with advertising in the community itself and with that um so if you want to give the CV upload form as if you're candidate then you can already right now submit to five companies um through CV upload meeting cpu.com um as these are companies which are listed from the last event or for already for the event in November um let me quickly go over the submission model candidates come to the submission form fill out their profile the selects employers which then you know create an application State maybe they also you know go that over the filtered search and then this is kind of you know interesting to the candidates again um the submission form is gathering the skills the field of work the region which is continents and later in the form of the countries um years of experience and on the first two and the layers of experience companies can filter and also on the region so for the community I hope this will improve hiring this will improve the experience to find jobs and I hope to be able to you know include Employers in in this community in a better way and of bring like free online events on a paid platform because the video is not free and it enables might work as they do with some easy class plus building a community for C plus plus and a platform and of course I'm looking for employers to join I saw someone of you already wrote me a message or sent me a network invite over LinkedIn I'll be going through those in a minute um if you have any questions I think yes so questions um you can post them to the chat and I might be able to read to them now um you find the job fair under job fair dot meeting cpu.com and also I'm happy to you know have all your emails if you have emails uh send me your email and questions pretty email that's also welcome thank you for listening foreign
