hello everyone I'm pleased to announce my new tour for 2024 beginning in early February and running through June Tammy and I an assortment of special guests are going to visit 51 cities in the US you can find out more information about this on my website jordanbpeterson.com as well as accessing all relevant ticketing information I'm going to use the tour to walk through some of the ideas I've been working on my forthcoming book out November 2024 we who wrestle with God I'm looking forward to this I'm thrilled to be able to do it again and I'll be pleased to see all of you again soon bye-bye that type of family destruction is what I personally find most objectionable about scientology whether it's coercing women to get abortions to keep serving Scientology instead of starting families I challenge anyone to name one other quote unquote religious organization that Weekly buses its clergy members to the abortion clinic I don't think you'll be able to find [Music] one hello everyone today I'm talking to Aaron Smith Levan and he has a YouTube channel called growing up in Scientology where he discusses as you might guess growing up in Scientology but it and and he left the he left the organization after a number of decades um and we talk a fair bit about why he did that why he came to the realization that this was a sterile route but more importantly the conversation allowed us to delve into a problem that we all face which is the fundamental problem of distinguishing truth from falsehood especially organized falsehood the the difficulty that we face in determining what organizations which are clearly necessary can be trusted and what metaphysics are reliable how you distinguish bitter fruit from from sweet fruit in that regard or separate wheat from chaff and so our discussion is very interesting in in that regard enabled us to take those abstract considerations and to nail them down to something very specific you know the events of aon's own life and the particular cult-like nature of Scientology which is one cult among many and so well welcome aboard for the trip I've been writing a fair bit in this new book I'm finishing up it's called we who wrestle with God and it'll be the subject of my next tour I've been writing a lot about the manner in which we come to distinguish truth from falsehood in general in our lives in the scientific Enterprise and then let's say in matters of Faith you know now the scientist types would say well all faith is delusional but I'm I'm afraid we can't move forward without faith so that's not a helpful that's not a helpful objection but it does raise us the fact that that is an objection at all indicates the existence of a very serious underlying problem which is well how do we distinguish truth from falsehood especially in relationship to religious claims which in some sense by definition are amendable to Scientific analysis or proof one answer is we just throw out the entire religious domain but that that's actually not even technically Pro possible so I thought it'd be interesting to talk to you today about scientology specifically because I think that it's not unreasonable whatsoever to regard it as an outright cult and that will enable us to use a very specific example to delve into a more General problem which is how do you separate wheat from chaff or bitter fruit from good fruit in the pursuit of the truth or even what is the truth and um it's always better to to ground an abstract analysis in something concrete and real and so talking to you about your experiences and what you've learned should enable us to get a long ways in this discussion then we can more broadly flesh it out into the issue of you know Truth Versus Falsehood in issues of Faith so let's start right at the beginning um why don't we just why don't you tell everybody a little bit about yourself personally about where you come from about your background your employment let everybody get to know you a bit and then we'll turn to the Scientology issue more specifically I'll do my best um how about I start from present time and then I I backfill a little bit sure um so one of the things I spend most of my time on right now is my YouTube Channel Growing Up in Scientology and so that alludes to the fact that I was essentially born and raised in Scientology I was actually four years old when my mom got into Scientology as a single mom of uh of two young boys and I was 12 years old maybe just 13 years old when uh I was taken out of school and started working for Scientology full-time uh full-time not day job you know 100 hours a week 110 hours a week and so you know my first employment history was Scientology and I've had employment history after getting into Scientology I've had employment history uh after um leaving Scientology but just probably most relevant to the ation that we're having is you know by the time I was 30 years old I'd spent half my life working for Scientology as a staff member and what they call a c organization member those are the guys who signed the the billion-year contracts so um yeah I mean we can go deeper in that if you want but that's the uh that's the nutshell well okay I think there's two directions we could go there the first is um well let's start when you were four even so what do you think it was that attracted your mother to Scientology like you said she was a single mother and so it's easy for single mothers to be prayed upon because they're quite isolated generally speaking and so that's a problem what do you think and and and what has she told you about what pulled her in the direction to begin with and what was her structure of belief or background you say metaphysically before before the blandishments of Scientology were laid out in front of her so she was raised a Christian she was raised in a very religious household going to church every Sunday um I don't know exactly to what degree she would have would describe herself as having been a True Believer um but I know the way she's explained it to me it was just this feeling this understanding this that there is something more something greater something outside ourselves but not necessarily having bought in uh to the traditional religious story she always there was that she was meant for something greater she was here for some reason there was some greater value to life um um than is a you know just a parent in this Mortal realm and for her Scientology um answered that question that you know it filled that hole whatever shape that hole was it was a Scientology shaped hole apparently um she was introduced to Scientology by a woman her same uh her same age roughly who had just had uh her own son just a few weeks before my brother and I were born um she was not a single mother but that relationship between my mom and this woman named Cheryl who got her into Scientology ology um that that's how my mom was introduced was through her friend Cheryl that's how most people are introduced to Scientology is through some friend or associate you know business associate or acquaintance or something like that now the thing about scientology particularly at the lower levels is Scientology is something that builds itself as requiring no belief no faith Scientology does not see itself as a faith even though it does see itself as a religion now and the the distinction between those things if there is one might be an interesting thing for us to discuss but scientologists do not believe that you have to believe in Scientology they believe it is a technology it is something you apply it can be measured the results can be measured you know they have this device the the e- meter that they believe assists with this measurement and so it's this kind of two-sided coin where my mom's looking for some greater meaning looking for some greater purpose looking for way to help others Scientology doesn't you know she comes across Scientology and she goes oh it's something that will give me greater purpose and greater meaning but isn't asking me to believe in X Y and Z we can just do um there's a very kind of like self-helping applied practical aspect of Scientology which by the way is why they call themselves an applied religious philosophy is how a Scientologist would describe Scientology okay well there's a bunch of things to delve into there so so so let's list out some of them and we can pursue them so your mother was raised religiously and so there's two interpretations of that on in the realm of possibility that spring to mind and one is that that prepared her to be subsumed into an alternate cult right because you might say well because she was raised in a religious family she was in the belief that you should turn to some sort of religious belief system was inculcated into her you could also say that she needed that initial religious belief like everyone does but she but it lacked something that she required which is something you alluded to which is the sense not only of a higher purpose that's specified for her but a higher purpose that can be practically worked towards and then you also mentioned and this is has more broad implications that Scientology was attractive to her because it claimed at least at the outset to be part of the the technological Enterprise the scientific Enterprise you might say that you didn't need Faith there was a technology that was at hand it had that that at least the the facade of scientific acceptability we can talk about the eers in a while and that it was practical and so it seems to me that the most logical conclusion with regard to your mother isn't so much that her previous religious training had prepared her to be subsumed into a cult but that the lack that there were lacks in her previous religious training for example the specification of a particular Destiny for her and the provision of practical what would you say practical guidelines for how she might act to bring the world into a higher Harmony all of that was attractive to her does that seem does that seem about right yeah I would agree with that okay okay and we'll talk about the eer from my understanding of the Emer is that it's a Galvan galvanometer and of course that measures skin conductance changes in people's hands and you know when I did my uh PhD we used a Galvan galvanometer essentially it was a bit more sophisticated but same basic idea back in the 1960s or thereabouts this was done even before then I think reaching all the way back to the 1920s it was shown that you know you could ask people questions while they were having the skin conductance of their skin surfaces usually their fingers measured and if something produces emotional arousal when it's touched upon your skin conductance increases because you sweat a little bit and that makes electricity flow more or easily and so you can use galvanometers to get at underlying complexes and I know that the Scientologist have capitalized on that idea and the overlap between what they do with the eer if I understand it properly and what psychophysiologists have done for a hundred years with the galvanometer also adds a layer of scientific credibility to it so you know and there is some utility in trying to get to the bottom of things so so let's unpack that a bit later okay so now she got introduced invited let's say by a friend now if you're an avid adherent of the Scientology discipline let's say or cult is it incumbent on you to try to bring other people into the into the faith and and how is it or into the Enterprise how is it that that's done and and and how is that also developed and fostered or trained so it's something that's highly encouraged it's not mandatory it's not required um there's an incentive to do it because when you bring someone into Scientology you're called their a field staff member their FSM and that person is called your selecte and as an FSM you get 10 or 15% Commission on every dollar that person pays to Scientology for courses or auditing or straight donations uh uh so there's a financial incentive to bring people into Scientology uh in addition to the there a Pam that is there a is is there a pyramid scheme element of that or is it do does it only go to one person like if if your person brings in more people is that also of benefit to you it's a it's a one LEL it's one level deep so you you don't get overrides on your downline you're you only get credit for the people you you directly bring in and once you bring them in you have to continue to be sort of their personal coach and and mentor on their way up scientology's bridge to total freedom or another Scientologist can swoop in and become that person's FSM and get commissions for them so oh I see so there's a competition for that as well an ongoing competition yes it's definitely a zero sum game and okay let let's start out by giving the devil is due you know obviously your mother was attracted by this and it's reasonable to assume that by hook or by crook some something that was genuine or at least significantly attractive was offered to her what do you think Scientology did for her that that filled the void that that had opened up inside of her at the lower level Scientology gives you an explanation for what's wrong with you that or you know anything that you could um in an insecure way feel is wrong with you indecisiveness uh not living up to your full potential um uh self-doubt insecurity all these things that that the cause of this is called the reactive mind and that's kind of elun hub's ver version of the the forian uh subconscious and that the reactive mind is a collection of all the recordings of pain and unconsciousness and these recordings are called engrams and these engrams compose your reactive mind and and and you're not to blame for the fact that you have a reactive mind it's not your fault the engrams are the source of all of this wrongness and negativity and Scientology and dianic give you the tools to resolve your reactive mind so there's an attractiveness to this which is saying you're someone who uh always has wanted to do better than what then how you've been doing this thing called your reactive mind is holding you back it's not your fault and we have the technology through our procedures in our processes we can get rid of your reactive mind and that will leave you um uh once you shed your reactive mind that basically leaves you as a perfect Computing analyzing uh it leaves you with a perfectly Computing and analyzing mind that's the pitch in the beginning so it's kind of solving a lot of problems at once and shifting responsibility to something outside of yourself right now is that clearing yes the procedure of getting rid of your reactive mind is called clearing and then you achieve the state of clear and if you ever hear a Scientologist say our goal is to clear the planet that's actually what they mean it's getting the majority of the population of Earth up to Scientology state of clear okay okay so we're going to give the devil his due on that front too so um you know obviously hubard pulled his ideas from the broader uh like intellectual body that was popular and developing during his time and all of what you just described is analogous to psychodynamic complex Theory and so the and you can see so let let me give you an example of that so if you're sitting with a client and they communicate a dream to you and you want to analyze the dream you can look for corresponding literary motifs the same way you would when you're trying to understand any story and analyze it thinking of a dream as a story but the association technique that Freud developed is predicate ated on the idea that you can flesh out the meaning of a dream or any thought for that matter any thought by analyzing the pattern of associations that surround that thought or story so for example if there's an image in a dream know imagine that you were dreaming and you dreamt that you uh you pulled a boat out of a rampaging River and there was a diamond inside of it you know the first thing I would ask you is well what comes to mind and you have to watch this what comes to mind when you think of a river and then maybe person will tell you a couple stories about a river and then you can ask them about a boot and you can ask them what a diamond means and you you try to flesh out the whole expanse of ideas that surrounds those images and what you're doing is investigating the structure of the associated ideas that gave rise to the images to begin with and what you find when you do that is that and and and Freud laid this out first first is that if you if you pursue that with enough seriousness you'll find something at the bottom of it that's often an unsolved problem and that would be so the engrams are memories that's a good way of thinking about them and there are obstacles to people's progress that are un implicit assumptions that they bring to bear about particular situations that are invisible impediments to their progress so for example I I had a client who uh had a very traumatic experience in a hospital when she was about five she fell into the hands of a she had kind of a dreadful accident she was in a shopping cart that actually rolled down a hill and it dumped her and hurt her quite badly and when she was put in the hospital she fell into the hands of a very sadistic nurse who was kind of tormenting her behind the scenes and and at that time the hospitals didn't let parents visit because they felt that the continual introduction of a parent and the separation was harder on children than just the absence of the parents which is a absolutely Preposterous absurd and cruel Theory but that was the case and so she felt simultaneously betrayed hurt betrayed and then she fell into the hands of this sadistic um nurse and so when we were investigating some of the dream imagery associated with her memories that story arose and she'd actually developed an entire complex of paranoia and suspicion in relationship to all establishments of authority because when she was five she had been betrayed by her parents who abandoned her in the hospital that's how she felt when she was five and then of course she fell into the hands of this Psychopathic nurse who was basically torturing her behind the scenes and so it's often the case that so what H what that what happened to her as a consequence of that was that because she developed such a deep distrust of Institutions every time she was involved with an institution she got herself in trouble CU she was you know she was like a little puppy that growled you know when someone pet leaned down to pet it because it had been kicked too many times and her paranoia just got her in constant trouble with institutions and of course that fostered her belief that institutions were basically bad news the reason I'm going through all that is because the notion that there are invisible imp impediments to your progress that are nested inside your Miss systems of memory that's true and it's also true that clearing those now you don't clear them just by recognizing them you clear them by reconfiguring them you know so with her what we did was a pretty lengthy analysis of under what conditions a mature PE person would trust institutions and under what conditions you should be skeptical you know we tried to generate a more mature Viewpoint of Institutions per se rather than this reflex of distrust which was too unsophisticated and low resolution now the reason I went through all that is because that explanation is actually quite credible and even the alliance of the galvanometer with that explanation that's derived directly from early psychoanalytic work in the 1920s because that's when all that started and psychologists social psychologists and personality psychologists psychophysiologists still use psychophysiological me measurements of various sorts to infer the existence of these complexes that lurk behind the scenes it's very integral part of psychology so you can understand well first of all where those ideas actually came from but even more importantly why they would be attractive to people now you added another thing that was of Interest I want to ask you more about this you said that the scientologists also insist that this isn't your fault now the classic Christian attitude towards your complex of problems is that the degree to which it's your fault is open up open for dispute so let me give you an example of that so imagine that you have a mother who's kind of overbearing and overprotective and you're a six-year-old kid and you're you didn't do your homework one day and so you decide to feain illness to skip school and your mother who's overbearing and over for protective also hasn't pursued her own life and she's Lonesome and so you tell her she's you're sick but you're not and she doesn't think you are but she is just as happy if you're at home and so you might say well that's the mother's fault cuz she's so damn overbearing but it's also to some degree the kid's fault because he's looking for an easy out and so and this is what you do in good psycho therapy too you know like if I found out that you had a complex the first thing I'd try to do is think okay well what were the situational conditions that gave rise to that like maybe you had a very overbearing father but I'd also want to find out well what Temptations did you fall prey to let's say that increased the probability that you would develop that complex for reasons of your own those are called secondary gains so for example this is the secondary gain issue I'm curious about you said that these what did you call them andrs these grams these engrams in the reactive mind they're not your fault see you can see why that would be attractive right because it enables you to place the responsibility for your suffering on someone else's on someone or something else and so I'm wondering what do you think about that like is that one of the things about scientology that's particularly manipulative or there's a mercy in it you know and I mean lots of people are abused by their parents and abused by society and it's not surprising they're hurt and it's not exactly their fault so what do you think about that the appeal and the attractiveness of being told that everything that's wrong with you is because of this thing and you are not to blame for this thing the attractiveness of that is why that is the message Scientology gives you at the introductory lower levels the that's so it's the bait the switch is that as you progress in Scientology you come to realize that actually as a spiritual being everything that happens to you by you by others to others is actually your fault and to assume full responsibility you have to understand how you are actually the prime cause for everything that has ever happened including happened to you and so uh this is the difference between Dione Xs and Scientology actually um Dione XS is supposed to be a mental science and it's supposed to be the process of getting rid of these engrams and then fast forward a couple years after Erin Herber started Di itics and then he started pursuing the spiritual angle the religion angle and so instead of trying to recall moments of pain and unconsciousness as early as you know prenatal incidents in the womb all of a sudden people were remembering painful incidents of pain and unconsciousness from previous lives and that opened the door to oh previous lives What's Happening Here the introduction of an immortal spiritual being and then El Ron Hub continued on with the religion angle and said well actually as a spiritual being you were the one creating your own reactive mind and once you've gotten rid of your own reactive mind El run Hubbert introduces you to the confidential upper level materials which is by the way you as a spiritual being you're in Scientology they call you a thean you have now gotten rid of your own reactive mind but now the reason why there's still things wrong with you is you have tens of thousands of other fans Spiritual Beings stuck to you as parasites as entities on your body all over your body and those beings all have their own reactive mind and those beings are through some sort of you know spiritual connection um projecting onto you you are experiencing their pains you are experiencing their Neurosis psychosis whatever you know anything that could be wrong with you and so now you have to go through a yearslong process of telepathically counseling using the Scientology procedures these entities these beings these theant to basically exercise them off of your body wake them up so that they'll realize who they are what they are and go and pick up a new body at the local Maternity Ward and and grow up to be a cleared individual and likely join Scientology so this idea of getting rid of your reactive mind is something that's introduced to you at the very lowest levels and applies all the way up to the highest levels it just switches from getting rid of your own reactive mind to to getting rid of these entities reactive Minds okay okay so so let me take that apart in a couple of ways so the first question I have there is how is the switch from it's not your fault two it's your responsibility how does that come about and what's the rationale for that it comes about when uh you introduce the immortal spiritual um The Immortal Spirit into the equation and elron hub's version of that is that about 65 trillion years ago there was some sort of spiritual big bang when all spiritual entities that exist came into existence you'd think he would talk a little bit more about this in Scientology but he really doesn't and um and that these spiritual entities are all natively Godlike and I'm not not like the Christian God but like like you know ripping atmospheres off of galaxies um creating planets destroying planets creating universes like that each in each spiritual entity here on Earth me you we are natively Godlike and we we've basically we basically got so bored with our power that we wanted a more interesting game so we decided to handicap ourselves in various ways and then just choose to for get that we had handicapped ourselves uh we used to not even exist in a physical Universe they used to not be a physical universe so we created a physical Universe to have something that we could then trap ourselves in to have some sort of a game that we could try to some sort of a trap that we could try to get out of to have this you know interesting experience um and without being too long-winded about this it it's basically when elun hubard makes the jump from just trying to be a poor man's mental healthc care like a mental therapy di index was supposed to be mental therapy to going okay we're going to slightly jump off from what we're pretending as a science now we're going to get into religion and spiritual philosophy we're going to um and honestly that was introduced by going into past lives when you start going into past life memories you have to talk about some entity that transcends death and that becomes scientology's thetan the soul the spirit right well okay so so there is he is introduced see part of the reason that Cults have such attractiveness is that they do harness archetypal ideas right Eternal religious ideas that's a good way of thinking about it or patterns of attention and action that are intrinsic to to what it means to be human and there's clearly the introduction of a karmal likee idea there right that that your destiny is a consequence of your your past choices I mean that's that's a tenant of Hinduism obviously and that you're playing out the consequences of this infinite array of choices extended over the longest possible period and it's also the case that see and this is a very tricky issue so dovi said for example that you're not only responsible for everything that you do and that everything that happens to you but for everything that everyone else does and everything that happens to them right and that's well that's a Doctrine that's associated with the broadest possible conception of responsibility and then the Buddha now when the Buddha hits Enlightenment under the bow tree he's offered the opportunity to stay in Paradise forever but you know eternally and he rejects that because he believes that it would be inappropriate for him to occupy the paradisal state unless EV unless everyone was brought into the same state you know and so in Many religious systems there is a transition point that you might consider equivalent to the initi ation into the religious Enterprise that brings people beyond their local concerns let's say with their own destiny and provides them with the Insight let's say that they are in some sense ultimately responsible right and then God only knows what that ultimate responsibility means now hubard concretized that and added a level of you know a variety of levels of strange narrative overlay um including the idea of these thetans but let's let's take that apart a little bit too you know you might think that you have your act together quite well you know let's just assume that you do as an autonomous individual but then you know you you're home for Christmas and you go see your family members and there's all sorts of unresolved issues around that within your family and those are definitely affecting you in all sorts of ways right and then in the broader social Community you're going to be interacting with people who are possessed by one idea or another and that's going to inter interfere with your movement forward and so in some sense there is no Redemption for you in an absolute sense in the presence of the pathology unresolved pathology of the past and of other people and so it sounds to me like hubard concretized that idea with the notion of these fans and so you said that they he conceptualized them as sort of stuck to you and so can you elaborate a little bit more on that like how did he conceptualize these these fatan likee beings and what does it mean that they're intimately associated with you and that you have to also clear them and how do you go about doing that so this gets you know into some things that have been widely ridiculed fairly so in places like South Park and other places on the internet so at the lower levels of Scientology the non-confidential levels everyone's considered a a aan aan is the primary animator of the body it is the basically the prime mover unmoved uh we are I'm a th and you're a th and aan is something you are not something you have okay it's not until you get to the upper confidential levels of Scientology that elron hubard introduces this concept of a body Thon and A Thon cluster and his explanation for what this is and how it came about is that um and by the way Scientologist concept of life in the galaxy is very much like Star Wars every planet or every star system has uh intelligent biological life okay so elron hubard discussed this thing called the Galactic Federation however many in this in this galaxy of however many planets that was composed of there was this politician um hubard decided to give him a name it's zenu or zimu and he decided his system was too populated so his plan to get rid of you know good portion of the population was to call everybody in for tax audits under false pretense and then when they showed up to freeze them in glycol and load them up on Space planes and fly them to Earth and drop these people into volcanoes and blow them up with hydrogen bombs now this incident was so severe this was such an engram for them and this happened about 76 million years ago of course the volcanoes on Earth didn't exist 76 million years ago but don't think about it too deeply and this incident for these beings was so you can't kill a thean but it came about as close to it as you could that it's basically left these beings um in this half dead unconscious you know crazy State and they're just blowing in The Winds of Earth for the last 76 million years and so then when uh you know the human body uh evolved through natural selection which scientologists are not opposed to necessarily um hubard had his own spin on Evolution but it doesn't necessarily contradict with natural selection uh that when human bodies arrived here on Earth uh a fresh set of fans that were not exposed to the volcano incident a fresh set of fans were rounded up and dropped off to this planet so that this planet could be a prison planet and elron Herbert says that if you're on this planet you were a troublemaker you were a rebel you were a an artist you were someone who couldn't be controlled the system wanted to uh didn't like you thought you were going to help overthrow the system one day you're like the hippie spiritual hippie and and so l c elron hubard creates this explanation that this is a prison planet that we are basically doomed to Live lifetime after lifetime after Lifetime with our memories being wiped in the between lives implant station and that the fact that we live uh We believe We Live single lives uh for the most part most people on Earth are not spiritual or religious We believe We Came From mud uh Elon hubard was very much um uh he hates Psychiatry psychiatrist psychology uh Darwin you know the anything anything opposed to spirituality hubard you know later on claimed to be absolutely against and so and even Huard would even say that the religious people on Earth who uh according to hubard have been pre-programmed by our alien captor overlords sort of spiritually programmed to invent these stories the world's major religions to of keep us occupied and to keep us from uh realizing that Earth is a prison and to keep us from uh seeking a way to get out of the prison and that even the religions of Earth serve the purpose of helping to keep the CI the the population of Earth trapped trapped spiritually as we head toward a presidential election in November one thing you can be sure of 2024 will be a tumultuous year how will your hard-earned savings Fair you already see the impacts of inflation at the pump in the grocery store the dollar continues to lose buying power quicker than wages can increase so how are you protecting your savings consider diversifying with gold from the Birch gold group for decades gold has been the choice of investors in central banks to hedge against inflation if you have an IRA or 401K from a previous employer that's just Gathering dust call Birch gold and they will help you convert it into an IRA in Gold you won't pay a penny out of pocket they will simply convert that 401k into physical gold which unlike digital currency can't be tampered with just text Jordan to [Music] 9898917350 why why is it what's the explanation for the motivation to trap us spiritually and to put us on the prison planet like what's his so basically he's trying to conjure up up an explanation for the Fallen state of man speaking let's say from a judeo-christian perspective yeah and we have to address that because people do feel that well people do feel that the world is a veil of tears and that that requires an explanation so why and and you Associated that to some degree with the fact that the the fan spirits who were trapped on Earth were there because they were Rebels or because they were artists so there's a there's but rebelling rebelling against what exactly so hubard doesn't spend a lot of time talking about this but it would just essentially be that just think of Earth as the goog of the Galactic Federation anyone who's speaking out anyone um who might become popular enough to gather enough power in society to to be an a thought leader an opinion leader Maybe One Day lead a Revolt that any anyone that zenu or anyone likes zenu I mean his name could have been Bob for all that it matters um that this is just a Dumping Ground a Dumping Ground a prison where no one's people are going to forget that we were ever even sent here no one will be coming to break us out and it's really only elron hubard and dynetics and Scientology that for the first time ever has offered the solution to free everyone from this trap now you mentioned Buddha you might be interested to know that Al Hub claimed to have been Buddha and claimed that as Buddha the state that he thought he created um and you'll know better than I is it bod is it Bodi do you know I mean I don't know B yeah okay that he thought Bodi was a permanent State um but afterwards he he learned it was only temporary and he had to come back and create dynetics and Scientology to create a permanent state that you not yeah yeah okay that makes sense yeah well it's okay so it's so interesting because hubard was the science fiction writer and this is such an interesting meld of archetypal religious idea and science fiction presumption and it is also the case by the way that you know science fiction is very and and fantasy associated with it is extremely popular among atheistic materialist people like engineers and the more technically minded like they get a tremendous amount of their religious education and motivation through Science Fiction and Fantasy and you can see that manifest itself in the you know absolute cult-like followings of shows like Star Trek and and uh and Star Wars and hubard was certainly part of that Dynamic complex I mean I don't remember how many science fiction books he wrote but plenty and so you can see this you can see this as the a more religious manifestation of a much broader cultural proclivity to turn this kind of mythologizing into something approximating a belief set and that's certainly the case with Star Trek and Star Wars you even see it to some degree in the Marvel Universe right with the notion that the Galaxy is populated by these Cosmic beings it's it's a recreation of the of it's a recreation of of of the of the of what the Divine hierarchy of the Greeks and the Romans essentially it's Recreation of the same ideas and so how much okay so I can see the archetypical rationale for many of these ideas now there's a couple of things you touched on that that are again Temptations I would say but they also rely on archetypal structuring so you don't get initiated into the Mysteries until You' delve you've demonstrated your commitment to the religion that's not something unique to Scientology and it's confidential so that makes it into a mystery religion but there's also a really interesting appeal to narcissism embedded in it because from what I've been able to derive from what you've told me hubard is also essentially describing no he's presenting to his higher level acolytes the possibility that they're truly remarkable Divine beings right marked out by their ability to become potentially dangerously charismatic and to pose a threat to the to the cosmic tyrannical order and you could imagine that that's also you know it's certainly the case that the typical sort of nerdy engineer who's a Star Wars acolyte let's say likes to style himself in his fantasies in the image of of Mark Hamill's character right and and to look for a mentor like Obi-Wan Kenobi I mean and so the notion that hubard could because you might ask yourself well what's enticing people farther down the rabbit hole once they've hit that threshold of confidentiality and the higher Mysteries are revealed and the Revelation that you have this infinite responsibility to set the world right but that you're also the sort of being that has that capacity because of your intrinsic specialness you can understand that that's a pretty potent and heady offering especially once you're in it why like you in it for a long time and I mean you said you were born into it so you know that makes it more complicated but what element of ego do you think was present in what Scientology offered you that was psychologically attract Ive to you so for me and and and the experience of someone who was put into it brought into it pushed into it as a child is greatly different than someone who chose to join as an adult I truly believed in the most fundamental level of the Scientology story that we are Eternal Spiritual Beings that these bodies are actually a a prison of their own type and that with enough Scientology auditing you can get to the point where you you can positively and stably exterior at will with full perceptions go in and out of your body at will this is you could go create this to remote viewing you could like that is essentially what scientologists are hoping to accomplish is to get to a point spiritually where you can be fully stably exterior of your body at will and with full perception so it's not some vague sense or feeling it's like as clearly as I'm looking at you from behind my eyeballs right now I would be able pop out over here and do the exact same thing and look at myself from behind and that might seem like um an interesting little parlor trick that people are hoping they're going to attain except that the ability to do that would be evidence that you are completely free from the pins that are holding you to this prison this mortal flesh and that and that you think that once you achieve that ability you should be able to uh stop keep reincarnating here on Earth you should be able to go out to you know visit all the other get born on another planet somewhere or something and El Ron Herber said no no no no you don't want your fellow mankind on your conscience so if you get to that level in Scientology it's ACC combinant upon you to come back reincarnate grow up again in a new body and help get more people into Scientology and up scientology's bridge to total freedom because um keep in mind um becoming this natively all powerful uh spiritual being doesn't inherently give you the power to help your fellow mankind you can still only help your mankind by using Scientology technology and so scientologists are hoping to get to the point where they achieve this spiritual ability and also are able to bypass I mentioned this word before but I didn't describe it the uh the between lives implant station so these are literal you know maybe a combination of physical and metaphysical locations that scientologists believe exist on the moon and Mars and Venus and whatever and that we're programmed as beings as a part of our um sentence to be you know to this Prison Planet we're programmed that one once our body dies we you know flash over to the implant station get our memory wiped or fan memory wiped flash back down beamed back down the earth into a new baby body and and you live a brand new life um with full Amnesia of your prior life and lives and scientologists believe that with enough auditing you can achieve this skill of being fully stably exterior at will with full perceptions and also the awareness and the ability to bypass the between lives implant station so that when you come back next lifetime you'll have full and Total Recall of everything you learned in Scientology you won't have to get trained on how to be a Scientology auditor again you'll retain that knowledge and you can just hit the ground running as you know I don't know a 12 13 14y old Scientology auditor helping to move more people up to the state of clear achieving this state of clear getting rid of your reactive mind is everything Scientology is supposed to be about now in modern times it's become nothing but a real estate fundraising scam but you know if we're talking about back when elron hubard was actually running things um uh achieving the state of clear and getting at least half the population of Earth to achieve the state of clear is is the day-to-day mission of Scientology okay okay so let's let's parallel two things here so I think we've done a good job of giving the devil is due now what we might ask ourselves is well hubard obviously had a talent for tapping into the archetypal fantasy substrate he wouldn't have been a success uccessful science fiction author if he hadn't been able to do that so he certainly had some talent in that regard now you made I I guess I would ask like so then given all this its attractiveness on the ethical front its explanatory power why and the fact that you were born into it why in the world did you start to become skeptical on what grounds did you manifest that skepticism and how is that associated with your kind of offthe cuff comment there at the end that you know this is degenerated into nothing but a giant real estate scam right and this this brings us back to the beginning of our discussion it's like well we need to live in a metaphysical realm we we need to live in a story that what would you say offers food for the craving we have for a metaphysical explanation to round out our lives and H provided a very baroke and elaborate explanation which isn't without its internal logic now but you obviously decided that some point that this wasn't for you or maybe for anyone else and so apart from the you know science fiction preposterousness of the entire account which as I said is grounded in a set of archetypal ideas um what is it that well let's say what bounced you out of the Scientology conceptual world all right let me let me take a whack at this CU it's never just one thing but I'm going to try not to get too far into the Weeds on this um and let me first make sure I fully answered your previous question which was even as a person being born into it what what was it that appealed to the ego of it and so for me it was actually believing that this is a prison we do all need to be free from the prison and that these upper confidential levels which I had never done I did not know what was on them these upper confidential levels really did deliver that result and that basically we're in The Matrix here and by doing scient you get unplugged from The Matrix and nothing could possibly be more important than that and even though um I could see people in my environment as a young little good Scientology staff member I could see people who had done all of scientology's auditing levels and I could see that they were no more special in any way than I was not having done any of the levels that was evident to me at a very young age AG I still let the belief in what scientologists call the upper unreleased OT levels see in Scientology you can only go up to ot8 well there's this story that elen hubard went off for the last six years of his life and created ot9 through 15 and that when he dropped his body in 1986 he didn't die he didn't have a stroke he positively shed his body after finishing up through ot5 and he shed his body so that he could continue on with upper OT level research that his body was preventing him from being able to do so the myth that I believed as a Scientologist is the myth of the upper unreleased OT levels ot9 through ot5 okay that simple little idea that the real magic is still in the vault and if we can only expand scientology's current organizations up to a certain level based on the instructions Elon Hub left be behind these levels will be able to be released and we'll finally be able to have auditing that allows us to become fully stably exterior at well with full perception that for me was the Lynch pin that for me was like my version of believing in a heaven right right right well did that also help to explain to you why the people who had gone through the clearing process were still not sufficiently special it's because well they'd gone a long ways but there was still much more to be discovered yes exactly exactly and so what do you think okay so let's let's look into that a bit like what do you think what do you think made you find that appealing like it was the knowledge of I guess it was the knowledge that there were still things you could discover that would Enlighten you that were still part and parcel of the process that you'd already invested a fair bit of your life into and that also had like encapsulated your mother I mean because to step outside of that you have to let go of a lot right you have to think oh my God my mother was far off the Beaten Track and that's a really complicated thing to come to term terms with and then you have to come to terms with the fact that you were sort of arbitrarily placed in a position at your birth where you were engaged you know involved in this cult which seems to be kind of unfair at a cosmic level and then you have to re-evaluate all of your own beliefs like there's a lot that you have to let go of before you can escape from this so that's a problem on the anxiety side but then it also beckoned to you with the promise of knowledge yet not yet attained that you could get to with sufficient discipline well that's a headyy mix you know okay so so yeah and not knowledge but ability okay right right right and I would argue that it's not that there was an aspect of this that I found appealing it's that this is what I was told was true it didn't matter if it was appealing that this is what's true and this is a prison planet and it it'd be like you know uh you you're familiar with the movie of The Matrix I assume oh yes well you live in The Matrix they can make your life amazing and the steak tastes great and the women and the everything but reality if you get unplugged from The Matrix reality is not as nice it is not as fun it is not as comfortable but it's reality and scientologists you know as a Scientologist what I was told is look this it this might be a great Lifetime right we might I might have trappings of wealth and great weather and vacations but that's the prison don't be distracted by The Matrix we need to unplug ourselves from the Matrix and we need to unplug everyone else so in a sense it's not appealing in a sense it's just the burden of the responsibility that we have if this is the version of reality we subscribe to right well well that's so interesting because that means that it's not appealing in the narrowly hedonistic manner but that it's actually a call strangely enough to adopt something like a higher order ethical responsibility right adherence to the truth and then participation in this process of universal salvation okay well again that sounds pretty good so why did you stop why did you stop with your adherence so the experience of being a staff member in Scientology and being a seor member in Scientology um it's a very hectic chaotic high stress experience and as a good little Scientology staff member I always believed that at scientology's secret management base now I know it's in Gilman Hot Springs California but at the time in Scientology no one was allowed to know where the secret intern management base was where David mavich and all of his staff worked in order what I believed of Scientology led me to believe that if Scientology were true if elron Herbert's technology was true and accurate and worked all the time when applied correctly the international Scientology base would be a Utopia it would be like a perfect existence of people working in Harmony in coordination in Affinity with one another no stress no anxiety no anger no temper none of the trappings of the reactive mind mind you might say in 2009 the Tampa Bay times did a series of Articles called the truth rundown and for the first time ever some of these Scientology Executives highlevel Scientology Executives who had recently departed but scientologists didn't know these people had departed not only had these people left the management ranks they had left Scientology altogether these people were celebrities in Scientology these were the international manag managers that all scientologists would see at the international events six times a year these people started speaking out about what a unmitigated hellhole the international Scientology management base was working under David mavich that for me was the first crack in the dam it just caused me to immediately question and reframe things like hold on hold on hold on at the international base they don't even have to deal with Scientology public they don't even have to deal with anyone demands they don't have to deliver services to anyone all they have to do is get along with with each other H how could it be so bad why did you believe the accounts do you think oh because they were people who I had um uh uh famous figures in Scientology I see I see so these were people the highest level managers working under David M okay so it was hard to reconcile well that's right and so up until then any horrible experiences I had in Scientology working as a staff member or a member in my mind I was like it's only bad at this level because we're too far away from David miscavage he hasn't there's too many um filters between us and him but one of the things that kept me believing was that the closer you got to David mavich the better things were and once I was exposed to information that allowed me to credibly conclude that the actual opposite was true the closer you got to David mavich the worse it was and what I was experiencing at the lower levels was just the trickle down effect of his horribly abusive and psychotic behavior right right so now the higher echelons are contaminated rather than pure that's right and so that's the first thing that got me going hold on something is not as I thought it was okay but that wasn't it that wasn't it the following item is what did it for me there was a particular seaorg member that I knew of by the name of Dan and he had a particular job at uh International management where I knew that if anyone knew what elron hubard left behind it was this guy like the job that he had was to compile everything elron hubber had left behind and figure out what of that material how it could be organized and released as services that Scientologist could do he was one of the former Executives that left and was speaking out and when I heard from him that these upper unreleased OT levels were a myth they don't exist elen hubber did not leave behind any notes there's nothing in the vault that that no one in Upper Scientology management has any clue whatsoever what was supposed to be on these upper OT levels I said you should have told me that 20 years ago I'm done I said that's all I needed to hear I said that was the Keystone that was holding it all in place for me anyway was this belief that that's why Scientology was important because these unreleased OT levels is what would unplug all Humanity from The Matrix and then we would go off to another planet and unplug everyone on that planet and off to another planet and so honestly Jordan it was just that one piece of information there are no upper un level well that's a major piece you know well one of the there's a gospel um insistence that you can that that you have to evaluate the spirits to see if they're of God right because you can have a revelation you can encounter information that seems credible but that is perverse in some Manner and so then the question is how do you distinguish again truth from falsehood and by their fruits you will know them is a good one so let let me give you a concrete example of that so I worked in the '90s at Harvard and that was a very interesting place to work they claimed the pursuit of excellence and when I went there that was the case like everything at the University virtually everything was subordinated to the pursuit of Excellence so when the graduates arrived there they weren't disciplined harshly it wasn't a rule-bound tyranny it was a place that was extremely competitive but it was competitive because everyone was doing everything they could to work as hard as they possibly could and so it was very intimidating for the undergraduates because they came there with all these other very smart kids and you know they were generally valedictorians and so forth in their own class but when they got to Harvard they were kind of average on average and so it was a very intense place but that also was true of the assistant professors the junior professors it was true of the associate professors it was true of the full professors and the administrators served that Enterprise and were Bound by the same ethos and so Not only was Excellence worshiped at the top you know as a principle that ethos saturated the entire organization okay now I left Harvard and I went to the University of Toronto and the University of Toronto is a pretty good University but it wasn't as good a university as Harvard by any stretch of the imagination and it did a lot of mouth service with regard to Excellence in fact you couldn't walk anywhere at the University of in Toronto without you know being berated about Excellence but in the details that just wasn't the case like the pursuit of Excellence was frowned upon often and punished now not not universally I'm I'm not saying that but in contrast to Harvard which you know was arguably the preeminent University in the world at the time and so you could you could tell the difference between the two organizations in the actual details of day-to-day interaction right there was a fractal relationship between what was being claimed excellence and its distribution at Harvard which was obvious and then at the University of Toronto where you know any deviation in the direction of Excellence you might say this about Canada in general by the way was just as likely to met be met with punishment as as reward and so that is one of the ways that people can calibrate the truth right it's not the only way and and it's not sufficient but you can go to an organization this is one of the reasons by the way I've like to work with the daily wire you know I had no idea what would happen when I started a partnership with them but my experience has been that they're very open to creative ideas and not only do they leave me the hell alone if I have an idea they they try real hard to help me put it into practice and it's actually helpful right so as far as I'm concerned that adds to their credibility right because they're practicing what they preach now what you pointed out was that you had a belief that at the higher levels of effort there would be a commensurate reward that the whole Enterprise was predicated on the pursuit of something approximating excellence and that was one of the things that kept you going and then when you found out that that wasn't the case that the fruits were bitter that was enough to collapse the Enterprise for you now you laugh about that now kind of ruul but that like I can't imagine that Discovery was anything approximating Pleasant for you like why didn't you collapse completely I think it's because to a certain level what I did in Scientology was I I was really just as a child put on this path given tasks and at some point decided that what I my goal was just going to be the absolute best at doing what it was I was being asked to do and I didn't NE it didn't necessarily require a huge commitment on my part other than getting really good at my job I did not every day have to buy in to this entire story of the prison planet it was only when I would be struggling when I would you know feel unappreciated if I was feeling I was receiving an injustice that I didn't want to do this anymore that I would go now hold on a second there was a really good reason I'm spending my entire life dedicated to this cause now what was that reason cuz I seem to have forgotten it and then I'll go oh Prison Planet uh Prison Planet the reason oh I feel so much better now that I've reminded myself that the reason I'm suffering in this way is for the cause of freeing everyone from the prison plan it and then I would rededicate myself to very much doing my job in the best possible way right but are you a conscientious person well I mean I don't know if I'm qualified to say that well you said you well I'm asking because you said said that you found it meaningful to be dedicating yourself to your job and attending to the details you know and there is a moral striving in that like I'm going to use this example and I'm not saying it characterizes you but it's a good example like many of the functionaries in extraordinarily pathological States so we could take the national socialists for an example were very good at their local jobs you know and they tried to now there would be some striving upward and some ego competition there and some struggling for power but lots of times people were just as they say following orders but to make that more realistic is that they had a bounded world where they had their tasks and they were microtasks in some ways and there was no reason for them to lift their heads up above those microtasks and ask where the whole damn ship was going and you said you know essentially that characterized your life that is part of being in the Matrix in a sense but it's also the case that people generally that is generally how people run their lives like once you decide you're going to be a school teacher you concentrate on teaching rather than assessing the validity of the entire educational Enterprise right even if you're playing soccer if you're out on the field you don't be berating yourself because you're not playing basketball right you're concentrating on trying to get the the ball in the goal so so it's not surprising that you took refuge in the you know the microcosm that you inhabited and what did you find that was locally rewarding about that like what what in your job daytoday kept you going you know I know you had to remind yourself of the metaphysics from time to time but what kept you going dayto day you know there's a lot of great people in Scientology scientologists are motivated are good people they're motivated by an intent to help they think Scientology is the best tool by which to help people and my job in Scientology was always um to help people this is interesting to think of it this way my job was to help people who someone else had already convinced to pay for the course and yet another person had convinced them to come in and take the course and my job was to help get them through the course so I was in my own way as a good Scientology staff member helping people who wanted to be helped and that's just a rewarding experience no matter um no matter what the um uh however it is you're helping if you're if if you're doing something that's appreciated by someone um who who you think is a valuable person and scientologists this is the irony of the whole thing scientologists really are are are um the ones who believe it and are in it they genuinely believe they're saving all mankind Tom Cruz believes that I promise you it's not a show well you know it's interesting too one of the things I've thought about Tom Cruz that's quite you know rather striking is I one of my friends in Hollywood informed me recently that there's there's maybe only one star now who's left that can guarantee boss office success on the basis of his name and that's Tom Cruz and I've liked Tom Cruz's movies and one of the things you can say about Cruz that's very it's Preposterous in a way but it happens to be the case is that his commitment to Scientology has protected him from woke nonsense so you know that's very interesting for me to see that and and I would say like you're a lot crazier if you're woke than you are if you're a Scientologist and so you know it's a lot more destructive a discipline as far or Endeavor as far as I can tell but but so the reason I'm saying that is because you know people can be in error in fundamental elements of their metaphysical commitment and still be in truth in some elements of the way they're acting and behaving and you know that's essentially what you were pointing out to yourself for yourself but so that begs the question still is like why did you decide not to just ignore that evidence like you could have Twisted yourself into knots and said that these people who were uh Now sort of Heretics and who were criticizing the organization were corrupt or that they were part of a background conspiracy or something like that like you could have written that evidence off that's true so why you must have been at a point in your own psychological development where for other reasons you figured it was easier to accept what they had to say as true rather than you know to go through all the shenanigans you would have had to to justify their their uh their deviation from the true path to believe them was very easy because they were there at the highest levels so even if they were lying about the existence of the upper levels meaning even if they were lying to me by saying they didn't exist then they really did exist there would clearly be something um I'll take half a step back if we use this Matrix analogy and if someone can incredibly convince you that the Matrix is real unplugging being unplugged from it is real only Scientology can do it and nothing could ever be more more valuable than that and if you experienced the truth of that for yourself nothing could ever get you to leave nothing nothing and so these people and it was Dan is the only one person I mentioned because I knew that out of all the people speaking out he would know even more than the others about the upper unreleased OT levels but the others would also know just due to their proximity to David mavich and his entire staff these people will would know if Scientology provided so much off offered the promise of so much spiritual uh enhancement that you could put up with any amount of abuse obviously I mean if we try to switch the conversation to you know um Christians saving people to go to heaven and I don't want to talk above my pay grade here but it's like if you truly believe that you're salvaging Spirits for eternity nothing could get you to stop and I knew that these people at the highest levels all having left and all saying the same thing the fact that they could even bring themselves to leave was already a hell of a lot of evidence that whatever was being offered at the top wasn't enough right got it so either way even if they were lying the fact that they had got that far and then and would then lie was even then that was indication that something wasn't right okay got it got it okay so how I'd like to know two things as we go forward I want to talk about the material Corruption of the Scientology Enterprise because you referred to it as a you know a real estate scam and I want to delve into that but I also want to know the mechanics of how you freed yourself because I mean you aren't only metaphysically committed which is a big deal and borne into it which is a big deal but you were also practically committed because it was your job and so that's a lot of like so for you to leave that's a more intense psychological transformation than even a divorce which would be you know that's up there that's about as bad as it KS for people in terms of that and death and so how did you manage to step out where did you step to why didn't you despair or deceive yourself and you know what what belief did you manage to orient yourself with as an alternative so the answer to that question starts in 2006 when my wife and I were both working uh in the C organization of Scientology out in Los Angeles and we were getting sort of fed up with our day-to-day experience and in the C organization you're not allowed to have children if you're going to have children you have to leave the C organization um and so we basically um uh got pregnant so that we could have a very easy route out of the sea organization now we still believed in Scientology we just no longer wanted to you know be basically working on a billion-year contract 365 18 hours a day uh we were like and you both agreed on that on leaving the sea organization yeah it was very evident see you're not allowed to talk with your spouse about leaving the sea organization but wink here and a nod there we were like we're ready to be done with this I see I see so you had an ally you had a real Ally that's real helpful okay yeah all right when we verified she was pregnant we each went to our respective ethics officers at our organizations that we work for and we said we're pregnant we're not getting an abortion we're leaving and that was our fairly easy route out of the seaorg that was 2006 we didn't officially leave Scientology until 2014 now 200 so when we leave the C organization at that point we are what they call in Scientology public scientologists we are now people who pay to do Scientology we don't work for Scientology so from 200 when my wife and I moved from Los Angeles to Clearwater Florida she had a lot of family here great place to raise a family two and I start working at at jobs uh making a good living for various scientologists different companies um 2009 is when the Tampa Bay Times newspapers come um stories come out called the truth rundown so that's three years after I left the C organization now information is coming out publicly that's making me question the entire Scientology Paradigm I start I secretly start getting in touch with some of these former Executives now this puts me in a very dangerous situation because speaking to people that leave Scientology is something that can get you kicked out of Scientology but I was still my entire existence I was still dependent on the Scientology ecosystem for my friends um my my income my my children's friends my kids schooling all connected to the world of Scientology so interestingly enough from 2009 as we described that's when my whole belief in Scientology started to dwindle even when I no longer believed in any part of Scientology I did not want to get kicked out I did not want to have to disconnect from my friends I did not want my wife's family to disconnect I didn't want my family to disconnect I was willing to continue to exist in this ecosystem and not speak out not spread around negative information to other scientologists um I decided that how I was going to add value was I was going to be someone on the inside who shared information about the current status of things with former members who were now on the outside and are report reporting on such things to the world at Double Agent then I wanted to be a double agent yes yeah yeah unfortunately I'm I'm just way too sloppy to succeed at that for more than a few years at a time So eventually and at this time my mom had gotten kicked out for spreading around information about David mavich that they considered to be negative and they told me I had to disconnect from my mom well or I was going to be kicked out but I didn't want to be kicked out but I was never never going to disconnect from my mom so I just lied my butt off to them for two years about this that I had disconnected from my mom but in reality I didn't in Scientology they have a very strong snitching culture people are reporting on each other all the time and I was just getting that's rough lazier and lazier and more careless in how I was well I was hiding all of this so that's that that that's something we shouldn't just jump over we'll go back to the story here right away in terms of the fruits by which you might know an organization that's another good one is so that we already talked about hypocrisy people claim to be pursuing one thing but their actions indicate that they're not that's a performative contradiction philosop philosophically when you claim an explicit belief but your actions be it but then that snitching culture that's a really bad sign right because one of the things you see that's absolutely 100% characteristic of totalitarian States is that they're they insist upon the ethical duty of their participants to inform on other people to the authorities and you really can't think of anything that poisons the relationship between people more thoroughly than that right because not only are you in danger of being informed on at any moment you're also in danger of being informed on by the worst sort of person who lies about you to inform on you to do nothing but redown to their own credit plus you don't know who you can trust and who you can't trust in which case you know you have a proclivity not to trust anyone so so the snitch culture how in the world did that develop within Scientology and and what were its manifestations as far as you were concerned oh my goodness um how it developed I mean Alon hubber explicitly laid down um various sets of quite Draconian rules and then created another policy that says if some if someone is found to have done something and you are found to have known about it and to not have submitted a report on that activity and behavior you would be penalized to the same degree as the person who actually committed the crime so in Scientology there's something called a knowledge report and all scientologists are expected to submit knowledge reports on other scientologists it's considered the individual group members putting in ethics on each other not leaving it up to the executives to put in ethics on everyone under them but uh people putting in ethics on each other El Ron Herber says so it's a distributed tyranny that's right he says a productive easy to live with and work with group is group that enforces the discipline member to member on each other and doesn't leave it up to the higher ups and so uh the snitching culture is such an important part of Scientology and I remember way back when back in like 1998 I saw this um movie called oh my God it was about um Swing Kids and it was about people in Nazi Germany and the swing swing dancing and this is when I still believed in Scientology but it should have been a red flag for me way back when I remember seeing the snitching culture portrayed in this movie about Nazi Germany and I I remember sitting there going that's Scientology that that's that's Scientology I mean it might seem like it's a stretch there but it's like the idea that the only the only good Scientologist is the one who's reporting on all of his fellow scientologists oh yeah boy that's not that's bad that's bad yeah yeah well that's also you know it's that's the one of the ways that totalitarian systems really get a grip you know one way is that everybody in a totalitarian system lies about everything all the time but the other one is they inform on each other to to the so-called higher authority right and then they make that into a moral virtue yeah that's really that's really really that's really bad so that that's a bad one okay so you're you're being told that you have to leave your mother but you're not going to do that you don't want to alienate her your wife and you have already decided that you're going to have a child you've left the the specifics of your job and and uh and um you and now you're kind of living a double life he no I'm going to I'm going to try to cover this superficially and quickly because if I get into the details I'm going to get emotional and I'm GNA try not to do that okay okay so what did you remember that that produced that emotional response it's the answer to an grab me it's this is the answer to the question for sure yeah and the story that I'm going to tell you here is why why I do my YouTube channel and and very much relish exposing Scientology every single day on my YouTube channel you could say I'm motivated by pure revenge and that's okay with me so by the time they realize I'm not going to disconnect from my mom they officially kick me out of Scientology and then they go to my wife and they say well you have to divorce your husband now at this point we have three daughters so you have to divorce your husband or you're going to get kicked out of Scientology and she says that's not going to work for me so they kick her out of Scientology and so then they go to her parents and they say you have to disconnect from your daughter and your three granddaughters or you're going to get kicked out of Scientology but my wife's parents have three other kids who have spouses that are scientologists who have kids you know whose whose spouses parents are scientologists and I felt like my mom had a had a choice that she could have made for herself I felt I had a choice I could have made for myself I felt my wife had a choice she could have made for herself but by the time you get to her parents they're basically going which kids do we want to lose which grandkids are we never going to see again so my wife's parents disconnect from her and the grandkids even though they live five minutes down the road brutal and then my wife never saw her dad again until the day he died oh yeah that's a rough one all right and so my kids you know when when my wife and I were officially kicked out we had both been working for scientologists so we lost our jobs um our kids had been going to private Scientology schools so they were kicked out of their schools and um and all of we live in Clearwater Florida which is the home of the largest Scientology organization in the world so the vast majority of all of our friends you know severed all ties with us including you know our best friends and so um that type of family destruction is what I personally find most objectionable about scientology whether it's coing women to get abortions to keep serving Scientology instead of starting families I mean think I i i d i challenge anyone to name one other quote unquote religious organization that Weekly buses its clergy members to the abortion clinic I don't think you'll be able to find one oh yeah that's a rough one that's a rough one and and those women have a lot of pressure applied to them to convince them that they have to get an abortion because uh it's so much more valuable to save the Save the Planet than it is to uh raise a family well there's plenty there's plenty of that going on in the broader public at the moment too too yeah all right well look look let's do this let's do this um cuz we're coming up on our hour and a half I want to talk to you more about what happened to you personally after you've left and about I know so for everyone who's watching and listening there is a website there is a website associated with with Aaron that is hosted by people who aren't very happy with him and we haven't had a chance to talk to that about that at all and so what I think I'll do we've gone through some of your autobiography which is often what I do in the additional half an hour that I speak to my guests on The Daily wire plus side but I think we'll do that there and so for all of you who are watching and listening you know thank you very much for persevering with us through this part of the story if you want to hear that part which is extraordinarily interesting it's the backlash against Aaron and what's happened to him publicly as he's come out as a Critic of the Scientology movement we're going to Del into all that on the daily we plus side and so um before we do that I'll thank everybody who are watching and listening for their attention and the daily wire plus people for um for facilitating this conversation I'm way up here in Northern Alberta we got a crew gathered so we could do this today so that's really good and so we'll delve into all that for another half an hour you guys can join us on The Daily World plus side if you want to do that and I'm going to thank you for walking through this I learned a lot about scientology you today and it was very interesting to you know to see what it is that it offers that's so seductive both on the plus side right the fact that it provides people with a framework within which their life takes on an enhanced meaning and then on the negative side the punishments that are associated with any deviation from the true path and so we'll delve into that more on the daily we plus side so thank you very much sir for your time and attention and for everyone else who's participating and watching and film crew here in sexsmith Alberta which is where we are today and we'll take 10 and then we'll get together and and finish this off sounds good thank you thank you very much [Music] sir
