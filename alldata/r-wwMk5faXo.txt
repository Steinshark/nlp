Normally when you pip install a Python package, it 
will download from PyPI, the Python package index.  But did you know that you can actually 
pip install directly from GitHub?  Take the git URL to your favorite 
project and add "git+" in front.  Then you can just pip install it to try 
out the latest commit from that repo.  You can also add an "@" sign with a git reference, 
such a branch, tag name, commit hash, or pull   request number to install a specific version.
This can be useful for testing versions of   packages that haven't been officially published 
yet, like from a feature branch or a pull request.  It's good practice to also specify the 
egg name, which is what pip will treat   this project's name as for the purposes of 
dependency checking, so if you later install   another package that depends on the GitHub 
one it will know it's already installed.  All this only works if the repo is an 
actual Python package with a setup.py file,   not just a lonely script.
Check out my video on automated   testing if you want to see how to set that up.
If the setup.py isn't at the root of the repo,   you can specify it with the 
subdirectory query parameter in the URL.
