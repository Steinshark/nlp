in this video I'm going to attempt to get random students I got for my Discord into big tech companies Facebook Apple Amazon Google Microsoft set it out blah blah blah all the big ones if I can't get at least one student into one of these companies then I uh I have to take a bite out of this thing the point of this video is to show you that anybody can do this it's not all luck I mean it's not no luck but it's not all luck I've designed an entire process I'm going to share with you the whole thing and show you the results at the end so here are the rules I can use all my knowledge and resources and all the money I don't have to help these students but I cannot offer students referrals why did I choose these eight students well because they were the best and brightest minds and also I only had eight applicants if you want to see the students profiles pause right here okay let's talk about the three major components to getting a job there's the application the interview and the part where you go home and cry because you didn't get a job and you feel really bad and that that last one might just be me first let's focus on the application this is easily overlooked by 99 of students yes that's a real statistic don't look it up don't just take my word for it so there are three important parts to an application first there's generally an ATS system and second the average recruiter only looks at your resume for six seconds so for the ATS system so this system takes your resume and stamps the hell out of it like aggressively and then it takes whatever it got from that just just a bunch of text and it Compares it against a job posting so I'm over here it basically ranks you against that job posting not completely unlike how my parents rank me against my more successful cousins then it spits out a score determining how well you matched that job posting simple right I should say Facebook recruiter told us that they don't do this for intern applications but take that with a grain of salt in fact you know it's take this whole video with a grain of salt so here's what I designed I designed a two resume approach Yes you heard that right two resumes the first one is an ATS scannable one the second one is just a really nice looking one now let me explain if your resume doesn't scan through an ATS system and they use one you're just dead in the water like very simply put there's no coming back now a good way to check if your resume is ATS scannable is open it up do control a select all text then go over to a notepad control V paste it all into that notepad and if everything looks messed up and you can't read anything then your resume is not ATS scannable if it looks kind of structured enough then you're probably fine there's resume is like job skin dot Co which we use in this video and it will rank your resume against any job description that you plug into it it's a really cool tool but we will talk about it later and no I am not sponsored by job Scan they didn't respond to my email we noted a few things from job scan most students were getting a 20 match between their resume and the job now with just a few simple changes we got that up to 60 to 70 percent pretty quickly another thing ATS systems don't generally play well with abbreviation so put the full length word and the abbreviation just to make sure you get both do you remember the movie Moneyball in it fat Jonah Hill came up with this algorithm for deciding if baseball players were going to be good or bad and it was pretty elegant and simple the only metric was how often does the player get on base and that's any base not even just a home run this simple heuristic let them replace all of their big names with like cheap level substitutes and they ended up almost winning whatever people do in baseball I created a similar heuristic for our purposes how long does the recruiter look at the resume my goal is only to optimize on this metric so I created these resume templates the Facebook resume that looks like a Facebook feed a Google resume that looks like Google search Microsoft resume that looks looks like Windows 11. these have been available for a really long time on my website but I originally created these just for this purpose for just for this experiment and I actually didn't give everybody access to them until these eight students used them if you want these resume templates you can still go to hired4tech.com enter your email now here's what you're going to say this is you look but Jason the resume won't scan through the ATS system [ __ ] 200 uploads in my comment section look I saved you the trouble that resume is not going to go through the ATS system you use your first resume to get through the ATS system any instance when you're going to be emailing this to someone or you know there's no ATS system or you're in a career event and you're in person use the other resume because that's the one that's optimized for that situation if you're thinking those resume templates actually help one of the students reached out to a Facebook recruiter and showed their resume and got this as a response the last thing I did for these students was I reviewed their resumes every single version of it that they created for every company and then I had them review each other's resumes which was one of the most valuable parts of the whole process okay now let's talk about the interview process so you might be sent an OA or an online assessment which is just basically a coding test to see if you're qualified to do a coding test okay it's [ __ ] but a lot of people they tell you you have to do these things alone but I'm going to let you in on a little secret most people don't do these things alone they do them in pairs or sometimes more I don't want to be sitting here telling you to cheat on it so I'm not going to say that so you pass the OA I don't know how you did it You Beautiful Bastard but you did it now sometimes there's a phone screen probably no for interns but they ask you like a semi-technical question something like how would you explain a computer to a five-year-old or how would you explain recursion to a five-year-old basically the recruiter has a five-year-old and they really want to get them into coding and they just have no idea do it okay so you've solved that you got that and now you're on to the actual interview now this is the part of the process that's been so beaten to death there are hundreds of products out there some free some paid they're all essentially just doing leak code problems now because I was trying to pull out all the stops I felt like I needed to spend money in some way on this part of the process so I paid for algo expert now you might be thinking Jason you're doing paid promotion for Clement now and uh no in fact I've never spoken to him my entire life if I did I'd say hey Clement nice to meet you and then I'd probably say like hey man go easy on the hair and then shouldn't say that no to cut that I'm not even gonna say that I'm kidding I think it's clear it's a joke if you don't want to purchase algo expert by Lee code or do blind or grind 75 they're just lists of leak code problems okay so now that you heard the full plan how did we actually do so there were a few problems to say the least well after I made this whole plan and created all the resources for it the world hit a bit of an economic scare a bunch of tech companies basically went on hiring freezes to stop the bleeding of all the tech companies that we planned on getting into only Amazon and Google ended up making regular job postings but the students still applied so let's take a look at how they did two students snagged four offers first one landed offers at vidyard Omar's tribal scale awanda and then I think they took omares second student landed offers from Ford point-click care TD and blackberry fun fact I worked at blackberry and they sold my entire team including me to Ford funny another student matched Iota one student got an interview from Citadel and they emailed him to set up a time and then they just randomly revoked it which also kind of sucks three ended up not getting any internships but they're gonna try again for next term uh that was a mistake one of the students here got an internship at 10 gam but one student got an interview at Amazon I ended up not being able to help him through the process too much because I was on vacation at the time but he did a pretty bang-up job and he got wait listed meaning that he passed the interview but they don't have enough jobs and they're kind of rolling them out now he also ended up getting a job offer at a company called level.co and he ended up taking that because he thought a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush one last really cool thing now remember I told you that two students didn't get an internship well the very next term one of these students applied to Amazon and got an offer I asked her what was the difference between your resume the last time we applied together and this time when you applied on your own this is what she said so the format of my resume was pretty much the same the bow tie but I think I did pick two very important changes the first change was that in my most recent Co-op or internship I made sure to kind of optimize the information a little bit and make it more relevant to what Amazon was looking for and then the second change that I made was I actually added a research position that I did at the University of Waterloo so by adding these two changes I think that definitely helped and even after talking to a lot of recruiters from these big companies they all talk about how they're actually looking for how much internship experience you have so I guess the more internship experience you have the more likely they are to accept your resume now since you got that job outside of the 90 days I had to do this challenge I'd still have to do the punishment so here we go this is what you've been waiting for okay as promised no student got hired it's actually not too bad oh that's in the nose oh actually that's not good that does not sit well oh my God [Music] you better subscribe to this video [Music]
