ladies and gentlemen it is with great pleasure that I welcome you back to Tata steel chess 20204 this is the first major chess event of the year uh there are two sections there is a master sections and a challenger section uh this is frequently referred to as the Wimbledon of chess the winner of the Challenger section every single year qualifies to play in the following Masters we've got dingly Ren back in action the reigning defending World chess champion who is also playing in the same section actually as Jan Jun who's the women's World chess champion we have yanomi we have Anish giri we have Ali Resa fua this is round number two and uh we're going to we're going to just jump right into it I hope you're all having a good weekend if you end up watching this when this comes out also funny yesterday I forgot to change the year and I forgot to change the year I mean like I I just put 2023 so I left it up there uh and I saw some of the comments and uh and I was like wow I completely forgot it it's 2024 now I will recap many many games for you today and then we will look at the standings the first game I got I got to show you just oh my god oh oh what a game what a game this was this is incredible what I'm about to show you is going to blow your mind of course I'm talking about the one only Ali Resa fuja originally from Iran actually originally teammates with his opponent baram makulu who now is the number one ranked player in Iran uh but Ali Resa moved to France E4 E5 played by Braham we have Knight F3 we have Knight C6 uh we have a Spanish with Bishop to B5 which targets the Knight and pan plays Knight F6 now at Elite chess level this is the Berlin and black tries to take that pawn on e4 white has the option to play D3 which is an anti- Berlin or white has the option of castling now I am willing to hypothesize something aliv Resa fuja has a very important tournament coming up in a couple of months which is called the candidates tournament the winner of that tournament will play for the world CH Championship I think oliv R is saving a little bit of his of his anti Berlin L preparation for that event cuz he's going to face it a lot instead he castles takes and now not D4 which would lead to Knight D6 take take D and an end game this is called the Berlin end game instead of that we have Rook going to E1 which targets the Knight and then Ali RZA just quite simply takes the pawn brings the bishop back to F1 so it couldn't be taken and it couldn't have been taken a move ago because of discovered attacks and we have the following position after some 10 moves now this is a very boring Berlin position the players have traded a little bit of pieces black is going to try to put two Pawns in the center and frequently the result of this game is a draw because the Berlin is one big fat draw that is what it is all the res Play Bishop F four Bishop F4 is a bit of a Gambit line like Bishop F4 loses a pawn take take and now Bishop takes D4 the only reason you cannot Rush with this move with Black is that white takes this and gets a very annoying long-term pressure against these pawns actually all engines say that despite being upon down white is doing very well which is why Paran plays this move as you can see he's not thinking yet he wants to put two Pawns in the center Ali RZA is gung-ho on giving up the pawn on D4 like he could play C3 you play C3 to make a draw you don't play C3 to try to play for a win so he plays Knight C3 that pawn is hanging the other idea is that now black cannot play the move D5 because white could actually just take it and then if you take you actually hang mate so that's not going to happen but if you can't actually play D5 in this position and you play something like D6 you might be okay but white gets a lot of activity and has more space and black really wants to be okay so black decides all right look this is D I'm going to take the pawn all right Ali Resa justifies his play by jumping into the center of the board but he's actually not threatening anything at all uh so now it's up to Black to catch up in development now you can see from Bam's time span he's still in his notes he still knows the position Ali Resa plays Bishop G5 the idea is that you can't take so the point of this move is to weaken the black position make him play a move like F6 cuz Queen D7 looks possible but then there's Queen E4 there's Rook E1 black gets a lot of his piece stuck and he can't develop very easily so position is quite strong you also have Bishop D3 by the way position is quite strong alira inducing weaknesses from his opponent plays Bishop H4 and now param spends 20 minutes and grabs another Pawn clearly at the this point param was out of his notes okay he had remembered up oh my goodness my nose is so itchy um he remembered up until this point and now he had to think by himself it's a very annoying position it's actually surprisingly difficult to make a move for black for example if you play Bishop F5 you lose to a fork okay well then I'll just develop the bishop to D7 great then I'll go here and if you take my Pawn I will go here and you cannot take my Rook because I will Checkmate you there's a force mate Bishop G6 Queen H5 Queen F5 is mate brutal absolutely brutal you just get absolutely slaughtered there is literally nothing black can do to prevent that by the way F5 I just take no moves so the point is it's actually shockingly hard to make a move while P says you know what it's going to be shockingly hard for Ali Resa to get through this position down two pawns Rook B1 and now I go back and I'm just I'm chilling I'm I'm up two pawns aliv resa is down two pawns but aliv Resa has what we call compensation all right in just what you compensate for a lack of material you have active pieces you have targets you have a lead in development right black pieces haven't caught up in development when you compensate in real life you're like not smart and you know to to to maybe compensate for a lack of intelligence or whatever you try to have a big car or something I don't you want to look really want to drive like a big vehicle that you're renting for the day or whatever you know people compensate for different things I'm I'm I'm not speaking from experience I've never done that wouldn't know anything about that um in fact anytime I like go somewhere and I rent the car I rent like the cheapest car just life advice from your favorite chess YouTuber I rent like a Chevrolet Malibu or like a Volkswagen Jetta it's like a you know normal car economical car don't need to rent the Lamborghini don't don't want don't even want to rent the pressure of driving a Lamborghini is ridiculous anyway that's all aside and saying that the next time you go on vacation don't rent the Lamborghini Bishop E6 Bishop C4 Ali Resa develops a very pleasant position param still defending himself but Ali Reza centralizing all his pieces not taking the pawn back yet still creating threats Bishop C5 look at the Knight I mean the knight's going for it the king slides over to Target the Knight so how is Ali Resa going to make progress he can't make much progress now one option is he could play Rook E1 but then Black Goes D5 and a lot of open lines are suddenly thrown your way and black is doing very well oi RZA had it all planned out though and in this position he played the absolute Ely gangster Queen takes H7 which received a brilliancy I'm going to add nope those are the settings uh I'm going to add this look at that a brilliant move Queen takes H7 brilliant move why cuz he left the Knight to die two different ways now if you take it like this it's it's pretty EAS it's just made you don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure that out but the other idea of Queen H7 is that if the king takes the Knight I Rook e one still can't go King f8 because of this if you go here I take that I got that I got that you're going to lose so Queen H7 and now param took the bishop that was another question what happens if you take the bishop cool Comm and collected Rook E1 and black is going to get mated that's what's about I'm about to go here the threat is actually kind of crazy like the threat is just simply this and this but if black were to play I don't know Bishop E6 trying to give up the Knight G6 Knight f8 Knight h8 rather I can take this I can keep the attack going so param after Queen H7 has to sacrifice his Queen he takes takes takes aliv Resa calculated all of this comes back Forks Black's King and Bishop and then wins it doesn't even take it stalls for a little bit finally takes the bishop and when it was all said and done this is what he had to work with what a what a what a what an attack he has a queen for a rook and a knight and a pawn nine is equal to nine but nine is not equal to nine in chess because this nine ain't this nine that's not what we're doing that's not what we're doing here he has a past age Pawn which is always going to be a problem and Ali Resa Zips down there completely freezes the black position trades down and the pawn is just going what's better than one Queen two queens I mean not in like a a romantic way that that's up to you and your partner and your preferences but in chess oh my goodness look at that look and and param just resigns just resigns why did he resign because he can't stop the promotion for example King C7 H7 and let's say you play like Knight F7 all right you stop the pawn I just go here and you you you can't guard everything if by some miracle this was the position pretty different story actually pretty different cuz tough to break through now white is still winning probably uh but uh what a game I I mean my man from the very beginning just sacrificed two pawns and just absolutely bulldo oh my goodness what a move Al the res starts the Tournament 2 and0 now let's check in with some of our other favorite players of course I'm talking about Hans Smokey Neeman as well as Mustafa Yas uh Mustafa is Turkish Grand Master I believe top three in the country might be number one probably number one but I never know like they they bounce around there sometimes uh but I think he is but they have a lot of strong Gun Masters they have like vahab salal I think I think iata still plays for turkey but anyway uh Hans plays a London you don't see that every day a London at top level we get a uh normal London stuff Queen B6 targeting the pawn Hans defends it Bishop D6 and then Hans trades and nowadays top level Grand Masters are playing these londons in these kind of ways where they're like I'm not interested in the advantage I just want to play a game of chess which is what we're playing but you you know you know what I'm saying I just want to just want to play I'm not looking for anything special we bring the bishop back to E2 we put our Knight there instead and Hans is just kind of going for like long-term nagging pressure kind of like a mosquito like a mosquito in the middle of the night is is there literally anything worse in the world other than like famine War like there there okay but on the list of things you know once we get past that stuff waking up at like 3: in the morning to a mosquito like come on like let's I that's bad you're I mean really like Miami Dolphins playing in 30° conditions and losing by 20 points I mean like it's it's bad but mosquito in the middle of the night like that's serious business anyway that's the kind of position that Hans is going for just like a nagging little like I'm going to just buzz around here and maybe I'm going to get something and mustaf this is not a fun position like no no if you told the chess grandmas that they would have this position with black every time bro they would quit chess man they would play drafts they play back gam poker this is just white is just it's a it's cards blanch like white just gets to improve his position indefinitely he's trying to get the Bish up he's trying to create a little bit of imbalance here if you take this I have a nice little fork zichun and Mustafa too is CR he's got the horses in the back is in the back um and he's defending himself Hans takes gets a little closer but it's just Black's doing a very nice job defending himself this is hans's biggest advantage of the game 18 minutes first time at off of zeros he keeps pushing maybe H6 was good as well to just try to soften up the structure it definitely is better but black is is so it's so tough and and now you got to trade the queens and like I said maybe maybe there was H6 like maybe right there was H6 and then you know if but how do you get the pawn back not easy not easy but it's what the computer likes computer always likes these kind of Pawn sacrifices to break up the structure Bishop D3 very odd moves but you know now apparently it's a draw because Bishop G2 and I can force a draw anyway we go into a queen and knight uh rather Knight and Bishop endgame and I mean Hans literally from like move 10 to the 50s just had a small nagging Advantage but you're not you're not you're not going to win this position it is unwinnable but uh we go 64 moves iconic and we make a draw 64 moves 64 squares on the chessboard Hans unable to break through that game but you know we need a little bit of these uh little little in between games to uh to show because then we go back then we go back to the uh go back to the big guns uh this might be a match between players you don't even know first of all I've never heard of Stefan I don't know if it's bukima Bima I don't know how they pronounce it in Flemish femish in Belgium I I never heard of Stefan in my life and that's not an insult as it turns out Stefan is born in 1996 and he's rated 2400 he's Bor like I'm 95 I'm December 95 nobody knows about us we're the Forgotten generation and he's not a grandm right Stefan won the qualifier last year so there's three sections the qualifiers The Challengers and the Masters he won that section last year so now he's playing he's playing with the IMs and the GMS in the challengers section he doesn't even have a photo on chess.com I mean seriously this is what I'm saying like Stefan keep fighting the good fight I'm cheering for you you're going to get the GM title one day uh elen robers I I'm doing my best Dutch folks I don't even know how the hell y'all say half your names uh like an giri that's not we not talk about Anish D Haven or something um anyway this is a matchup uh in the Challenger section Elina is uh I am I think she's like 17 recently got a big sponsorship uh over in the Netherlands so they're supporting her a lot this G the opening was a weird one in this game it was like a Indian thing it was like a you know like a kind of a Catalan invitation for white and then black BL C5 so we just kind of got a goofy position white developed the pieces like this to prevent anything from coming here and good good Synergy good Harmony in the position preventing Black's pieces from expanding a little bit of a weakness some weak stuff here you almost wish this Pawn was on C4 uh but he took a lot of space he took a lot of space early on he had a nice Advantage Elena started fighting back and controlling his Queen side got in there with the queen but he did a nice job and then that very annoying nagging Outpost with the with the pawn and the knight in the center he had a big Advantage early and then he launched an attack with F5 th this was Master Class in same side attacking chess right Rook C7 Rook C8 black trying to create counterplay but white just too fast right but now Bishop B5 sniping he took and then he went here and and this is how you you started realizing uhoh he's defending his position and attacking with the same piece that Bishop is a beast Rook C3 from Alina and then she plays Bishop E5 and she did a nice job as well creating this monster Bishop which was defending and attacking also she just had to be a little a little bit more precise defond did everything right to try to keep posing problems then he just said you know what I might need a pawn in an end game let me just zip out over there grab the pawn and come back Knight F7 he brought the bishop back and now Rook C7 and that was a fatal mistake black should have went Bishop F6 blocking the file ready to put a knight on E5 instead of that she went Rook C7 and Stefan a man after my own heart 27 28 years of age only an international Master going to get that grandmas title hopefully before he's 30 but maybe in his 30s Stefan you got to prove me you got to prove all the naysayers wrong that we can do it in this position my man Stefan bukima sacrificed his Rook Rook takes out five he got five pieces in the game and they are all attacking if you take it is just game over momentarily she tries to give away a pawn to S to try to fight back he gets he just takes it which apparently is the wrong move by the way scumbag stockfish here saying that he should have gone Queen G6 Queen H7 and then played this absolute monster move take take King E7 Queen F6 King D7 Bishop B5 and black is just this is what the kids call cooked severely well done de though at doesn't really matter I mean the engine doesn't bless it but I mean dear Lord what an attack from Stefon every piece utilized a beautiful same side attack he takes Bishop C4 is going to win the queen it's a lot worse than that actually it's not just about winning the queen that's mate like Queen G7 is made so the king's got to go here he'd go here and then it would be it would be game over a very nice attacking game a rough start for Elina in the Challenger section who has I believe zero I think she lost her first two rounds and she was a person a player to look out for now let's pop over to the Masters uh we have yanish we have J and June yesterday yanish just a scintillating vintage Yan pishi Victory with the black pieces versus max vadam J and Jun the interesting thing about J and June playing uh in tata steel is the fact that she is the women's world champion and of course there's always this conversation about like why is there women's chess and and open Chess it's like it's women's and and and like men's but you know technically it's not technically it's open and women's and I am going to make like a longer Deep dive video into the history and all of that I can't answer all of that at this very moment that's just sort of like how it's always been uh and the argument that like it's not a physical sport so Etc I mean it goes on and on and I tend to agree with some disagree with some it's a Nuance conversation all of that aside it's always interesting to see and I'm not sure this has happened in a very long time that the reigning defending women's world champion is playing in the open of Tata steel and yesterday she had a fantastic game against Anish giri I think she's underrated and frankly I think there are many women in the world that could be underrated cuz they play in like their own little bubble which is weird Okay yesterday J and Jun had like a 7h hour game against the n giri and she's 2549 like if you put a 2549 like a like a real 2549 I mean I I'm not sure that that would happen and you're going to see from this game as well I mean yanomi plays a Catalan probably using some World Championship prep Jan June showing nice control in the opening equalizing pretty comfortably playing this absurd setup which looks like it just doesn't make any sense I mean looks like black is playing uh I don't know Tetris over here on the side of the board and then she creates a little bit of counterplay and and and nepo early on was was down on time he's he's generally a fast player uh and you know what he did was he he kind of sent it to an endgame they had a they had a large exchange of pieces and we had this and when I saw this I thought okay Jan is not Magnus but he's going to slowly you know improve his position and all this stuff and he did he really did I mean like he he he really improved his position but Jan Juno's excellent understanding plays G5 which is a really obscure pawn move but she's just trying to shut down any advancement over here Yan keeps dancing and seizing a little space and she's just sitting back like dude you you got nothing you get we have the same pieces we have Rook Knight Bishop we have the same pawns same exact pawns how you going to win Knight B2 Knight D3 He gives away a pawn he's trying he's trying to create winning chances she completely unafraid go ahead get my Rook I got get the rook in here I'm I'm not worried let's trade Knights now we have rook and Bishop end game traditional wisdom is pointing to the fact that white should be better in all end games because four of Black's pawns are on the wrong color all of these pawns are on the right color they they are the different color than the bishop and this bishop can't touch them but it was a battle and you know they shuffled and white tried and he poked and he proed and and there's and he tried to make some counter but it's just just keeps simplifying and black is defending very well and nepo ended up down upon PA he like gave away a pawn to try to get some activity but he never got anywhere in the game like this is this is how it ended and like a relatively effortless draw for Jan Jun against Yan poni which is what I'm saying like this is very fun to see she's had almost no problems in the first two rounds against an average rating of like 2755 which kind of like goes back to the whole theory of like why are there different divisions and like vastly different rating systems etc etc and I'm curious to see how she continues to do CU she has had basically no problems in two rounds and uh I mean yesterday she was outplayed in an end game and that's life and it was a tough end game now two games to go both exciting Jordan van Forest uh whose name again it's probably more like Jordan vanest versus Max vadam uh these are the number two and number three ranked Dutch players I believe unless there's somebody in the middle uh yesterday Jordan lost and now we have another London and with that I'm going to go to the next game no we have a we we we have two guys who love the London so much they both played it at the same time all right and then they copied each other for a little bit and uh they both castled queenside I've like never seen a London where both sides Castle Queen side but these guys are very uh flexible players very Dynamic players Jordan plays Queen A5 this almost looks like a game between like two third graders and I don't mean like prodigies I mean like two friends who are just like well you Castle Queen I'm going to cast a queen side and then this guy plays Queen A5 and he's like he's never going to see that this Pawn is hanging now admittedly if King B8 is played here white could actually build up an attack pretty quickly uh but after Queen A5 Max takes on E5 and then he goes here and then Jordan keeps trying to push a little bit but black is actually very safe and then Max plays this and he's got very clear intentions that he would like to attack Jordan as well Jordan has a very difficult decision to make and for reasons I don't quite understand he went here now me you ask me what to do here I put my king on A1 I'm like I'm not opening this for him King B1 F5 then I go E5 then your Bishop is garbage your Bishop is garbage maybe I could even take and I can attack your e- Pawn but he plays E5 himself Max goes Queen C5 and now now the game gets tactical now we now we got a lot of open lines lot of open lines Jordan plays this trying to grab the pawn and trade okay we trade the queen but now we cannot take this because this is check bait basically so then we go here Max plants the bishop and Max has a very annoying position Bishop B3 back and Max has a very annoying wait a minute what is happening suddenly Jordan sacks The Rook how did that happen how what Bishop apparently what we needed to do was play this Rook d 6 B3 Rook C6 run the king this way don't know if that's very human B5 take Rook C2 all of this is the top line of the computer and white just says I'm not losing I don't know about all that he did it this way and said I'm going to sack the rook and try to draw the end game but uh Max was just too powerful here with his Rooks he repeats he's not going to make a draw he starts bringing more Pawns stockfish still not giving a winning advantage to White uh rather to black I mean I would hope it's not giving a winning advantage to White uh but uh Max very controlled now Jordan's going to try to create counterplay with his three here King D7 G5 B4 but Ju Just this and you can't take because you're forked and you may be wondering why Jordan try didn't try to make any more progress cuz he can't he like physically can't he plays H6 that's it he can't move a single Pawn forward so a weird a weird game like a double London where like we had a pretty symmetrical position and then white went for an attack which didn't work basically immediately and then black just somehow in the dust cleared had this paralyzing position like I I mean this move E5 cost yordan the game I that's what it I mean it's not that simple of course but I was just shocked that he you know clearly like I said if you play King B1 black will go E5 and try to reopen the position maybe black will play F5 himself as well F5 to try to get everything but at least when like your king gets here and then you're not getting mated and but yeah this is a wild move he played this and it totally backfired totally to and he's actually 0 and2 he lost the first round to fuja last game I have for you Wei versus GES always interesting to see Wei back Wei does really hold the title of one of the biggest wh ifs uh in chess I mean that that's really the reality he was 27 40 at the age of like 17 which is why in stories like fua we always kind of hold our breath and we see what happens always interesting to see him play always interesting to see gcash play as well um wey plays in a way that provokes G5 it's a very common system nowadays and there it is there is G5 and black trying to be very aggressive on that King side but way trying to be aggressive on the queen side so we just basically showed up today to get in a fight with somebody take take you know like sometimes you leave the house in the morning you're like if somebody messes with me today I'm going to punch them in the face strategically like of course if you live in a big city you're not just going to get in a fight with anybody some some big dude's GNA you're like I'm not going to no you could do whatever you want you got to strategically pick your fights you know that's what we he did he's like I'm going to strategically get into a fight with gkes today all right Rook C1 and now D4 this kind of oh stubborn oh my goodness it's a little bit ugly I mean it looks like we're playing checkers out here but it works Knight F1 Knight E7 we're maneuvering and now gukesh says all right I'm tired of waiting going to go for an attack myself C4 very complicated position we could sit here analyzing this for 30 minutes if if not C4 you can play Bishop D3 back and then you can play A4 and I can't explain either of those moves to you I mean Bishop D3 at least defends the pawn but it's not like the pawn can be taken if you take on e4 there's all sorts of tactics C5 could even block your Bishop out of the way we have Pawn takes Knight D5 giving up the pawn not taking back right away Queen d8 now he does take the pawn but I got news for you that's not a fork because of this how is there even a knight on G7 all right black plays Bishop C5 targeting the pawn here maintaining the pressure you may be wondering why black did not give a fork that's because after Knight E7 Queen E7 there is C5 gambiing the pawn right you can take the pawn but then there's Bishop C4 check and the bishop re-enters the battle there is also Knight F5 and after take take white is actually the one attacking so there's a lot of complicated tactics in this position it's never that simple Knight takes C7 and we initiates a massive tactical sequence leaves his rug back here Queen C7 leaves the rug back there again gkes takes allowing the pawn to capture on D6 for a brief M moment gash is up seven points of material but after Pawn takes D6 his Queen is hanging his Knight is hanging his Bishop is hanging he goes here now we can take and threaten this or we can take the bishop and leave the pawn he takes the Rook is hanging the bishop is hanging The Rook moves now he's got to take with the Knight but what about his Bishop well first we play EA Queen deflecting one of the pieces to take it takes now we take with the bishop oh my goodness the bishop still is still hanging and now in this is crazy now instead of taking the bishop gukesh plays Rook takes A2 removing a defender of the Knight and sniping the pawn queen F2 is mate that is mate Queen F2 Queen G2 so so Wei has to go here check King h8 brings the Knight forward but it's really a defensive move and when the dust settles wait a minute has the dust even settled The Rook is still hanging but he can't really take it because the Knight is hanging so if the dust settles black is just up a full piece full piece four pawns each so we plays Bishop D6 Lukes plays Queen A5 and he just centralizes threatens a queen trade hits The Rook wa he just resigns out of nowhere like the position was more or less kind of balanced you know was like very much in the balance age5 this move really freak way out like he really didn't like the prospect of being threatened on this side of the board so he decided like I'm I'm going to start taking a little risk I'm going to go for the C4 C5 idea I'm not going to take back on D4 right away and then right here was a big moment for what he had to do he had to take a deep breath but with seven minutes on the clock instead of taking a deep breath and just like relaxing maybe sacrificing The Exchange and then moving on no instead of doing any of that he just he got into a huge scrap he just got into a huge scrap he just rolled the dice went C5 and when the dust settled he was lost what he had to do he had a couple of things he could have played Bishop C4 check and then he could have taken here just kept the pawn there another thing in this position he could have done I I think after the promotion is uh Rook F1 just defending mate but the thing is he's still losing like he's still down a rook for a knight and black has a pass B Pawn and so it's all bad it's all bad uh Wild game and gkes wins he comes out on top and your standings after two rounds of action are as follows Aliva fua two and O Yan giri and gesh with this Victory with one and a half yordan V is the only one scoreless but there's only two rounds played we we got still many more rounds to go haven't featured donchenko yet donchenko is the winner of last year's Challengers haven't featured Prague because he drew two games haven't featured nerb because he drew two games and those are the only players that I haven't featured yet uh but that's okay dingly Ren today also made a very solid draw and your standings in the challengers Salam Salah haime Santos latasa from Spain Hans miman Leon menona who's an Indian grandmas although that name with that name if I didn't know I would have thought Italian but he is from India then we got Stefan who we got to get a profile photo for chess.com and there we go I will see you all for round number three I might not be making daily Recaps because I kind of don't want to cover this tournament for two straight weeks maybe I'll make a recap of rounds three and four uh but until then get out of here
