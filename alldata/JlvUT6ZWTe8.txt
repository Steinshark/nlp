hacker put malware on a Discord that I hang out on so naturally I downloaded it to see what it did the hacker was trying to convince us all that the software was a game he and his friends were working on and wanted to know if we would try it out being the engineer that I am I trusted him downloaded it and ran it just kidding being the paranoid skeptic that I am I decided to reverse engineer the game and see if its insides were evil or not like any good reverse engineer I ran strings on the binary to get an idea of what I was in for at a quick glance at the strings I was assured this probably was not a game after some initial triage in my favorite disassembler Ida love you girl I found out this game wasn't a game at all it was malware what does the malware do who wrote it and are they after me all these questions were racing through my mind and me and my girl I'd ever gonna figure it all out eventually I discovered that malware was one part of a two-stage attack this game was actually just a loader that disabled a ton of stuff on my computer like Windows Defender real-time virus protection spyware protection and a ton of other windows anti-virus features after this the game downloaded its second stage from this sketchy URL here which it later executed under this name so you guessed it I downloaded the bigger malware too now that the actor had my IP address because I didn't use a VPN good job idiot the Clock Was ticking the second piece of malware was bigger and more intricate unfortunately this binary was heavily obfuscated I didn't have time to reverse engineer how it was packed and right and unpacker so I did what any sane person would do I just ran it but I ran it in a sandbox dropping the second stage malware into any dot run I saw the malware doing a couple of interesting things first the malware called out to this IP address with a bot ID where the server returned a second binary that eventually got executed by the loader loader ran took a screenshot of my desktop sent it home and created a task to run this command here after all was said and done it turned out that the final stage of the malware was just a Monero crypto Miner nothing too malicious but I still wasn't happy when I went to confront the hacker in Discord he was gone that's all for now guys thanks for watching leave a comment and let me know if you want to see more reverse engineering stuff and then after that check out this video about how it exploited a bug in my server software we'll see you there
