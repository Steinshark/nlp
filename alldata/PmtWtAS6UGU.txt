ladies and gentlemen in today's video you are going to see one of the dumbest chess games ever played and I do not say that lightly because I am the professor I am knighted I am the PHD graduate of idiotic chess games and this one is right up there now you may notice there is a hotel room set up here that is because I'm currently on vacation in Europe and this game was so bad I actually considered getting an early flight home and getting back to my home studio and not even recording this on a laptop that's sitting on a bed uh I will be uploading photos of all of my home setups I'm currently sitting like this so without further Ado allow me to show you this absolute travesty um this is a person that managed to win a chess game against another individual while losing by two queens and a lot more than that now we're actually going to look at this from the heroes perspective hero is playing with the black pieces and this is a poker term uh hero is not Italian but gets the Italy flag because I was just there many of you guessed where I was based on the stuff behind me now you can guess where I am again although you don't have to guess really because I kind of already showed you where I am but maybe you don't know that anyway guests from this curtain where I am in the world now um so these people are 400 allegedly what you're about to witness um that's what it's said on Reddit but they lie on Reddit a lot so the game begins with the move E4 which is already a good start and the tragic opponent with the white pieces plays Knight C3 now I got really excited when I saw this because I thought oh tragic opponent must be my subscriber right because they're playing the Vienna and then promptly on the next move they played this which which is a legal move but it but but it's it I mean the whole like this is the Vienna Gambit the whole point of not developing the Knight there is to play the move F4 if I misclick anything by the way it's because my mouse is currently on my lap because the table that I'm using just put my mouse on doesn't register my mouse but my pant leg does my wife is laughing at me in the background because this is the links that we go to to show you chess games um anyway black plays D6 you know which is a move it's a legal move as is evident from it being made on chess.com it's not the best move the bishop is blocked in a little bit but okay whatever these are 400s like nothing special is gonna happen yet but something special is going to happen on the very next move and for the duration of the game um actually something special happens every day when you tune in to watch a Gotham video Bishop to C4 so far wonderful stuff this might not be my subscriber that's not this might not be somebody that plays the Vienna or even tried my free sample all right I'm like one of those people that's asking you to take the free ice cream sample on the street I don't know if that's just the thing in New York uh all right the memes begin at move four when here for whatever reason not developing a bishop or a knight or a bishop or literally any other normal move black plays the move B5 that is a bad move the way I want you like newbies to think about this is if your move resemble or your opening resembles nothing that you have seen in any of my videos it's probably bad this move loses upon two different ways there is literally no justification for this move you should not even be playing moves like this you should be like a child getting chastised by parents you do not get to eat sweets if you don't eat vegetables proteins whole grains like what stop it what even is this white takes unfortunately white then proceeded to take the next Pawn too because they just assumed you know it's Checkers and that's not a good move because it just loses a knight a bishop rather the bishop can just be taken by the Knight but you but you haven't seen anything yet nothing at all you haven't not even close so it looks like we're back to normal territory right I mean I wish we had gotten there you know with Knight C6 but all right white decides to take a pawn and then take the next Pawn too because if my opponent blundered one Pawn that means they definitely blunder the second Pawn all right now white should Castle here white plays D3 I don't hate that move now what black needs to do here before they go to battle is they need to go Bishop E7 in castles but basically or like Bishop G4 or something you need to use the pieces that you have the chest Gods gave you so many pieces give everybody a turn do any of you have siblings you gotta give them a turn too you can't just hog the PlayStation or whatever the kids play nowadays I don't know viral Tick Tock Talent challenges that result in God forbid deaths I mean like I don't know what you all do nowadays but back in my day it used to be you know playing Jack 2 on the PlayStation um anyway black does not do that and and black here follows the ancient proverb of if me just move horse me move horse again Knight to D4 you know you you just moved it so why not it's is it a fair trade Knight takes Pawn takes is it good to trade when you are uh up yeah yeah it's good it's all good take take fantastic okay so it's good to trade nights when you're up white plays Knight D5 this is not a complicated equation if it's good to trade Knights when you are winning and you just initiated a night trade and now your opponent initiates a night trade should you take the Knight so I want you to think about it for a second I'm gonna say it one one more time I'm gonna paraphrase what I just said if trading is good when you are winning and you just initiated a trade that went successfully and your opponent initiates a trade of the exact same pieces should you make the trade correct you should Knight to D7 God him her themselves could not possibly explain this move to me why did Black do that is it a bad move no according to the computer it you know it loses Advantage but just take the okay whatever castles now at this point black realizes wait a minute I haven't developed my Bishops I also have Bishops black 10 moves into the game did what any 400 does which is realize they have Bishops so let's just like it didn't dot like they just spawned you know like black booted up a game on charles.com and realized oh wait a minute wait what am I doing I got Bishops like I forgot all right Bishop B7 fantastic now can we also get the second one out and then Castle or maybe or or maybe maybe take the Knight because it's you know and then right now what we are going to do here is we are going to play the move F5 which is not a bad move only if your opponent is a donkey the idea of F5 is actually a very logical follow-up to the move Bishop to B7 because the bishop has eyes on the Knight black in this position played the move Pawn to F5 with one idea in mind and that idea is if the pawn takes my Pawn the bishop takes the Knight that's it I commend the hero for even realizing that but if you want to gain another 200 ELO you got to ask what if they don't do that and does this move actually cause me more long-term harm it does because you're weakening your king from the diagonal and also your king is in the center so you really shouldn't be opening up the center of the board and that's very important because that's that's what's about to happen and it's about to expose itself pause so F5 black played with one idea in mind if Pawn takes then Bishop takes nine all white has to do is not take the pawn and this plan is bad white takes the pawn immediately white loses the Knight this is why y'all stay 400. y'all stay 400 for the same reason that Ronda Rousey fell off so hard in her UFC career Ronda Rousey this is a mixed martial arts analogy if you don't know that sport basically let me explain it to you there was a dominant Women's Champion but she beat all of her opponents in 30 seconds she probably bought into her own hype and none of her bad habits were exploited she was not challenged in any way and ultimately she had a very sharp and quick fall the reason you cannot push past 400 is because in half of your games you are still getting away with the same nonsense like this then in the other half of the games I don't know you disconnect hang a queen in one move anyway it's bad to open up your king why because it moves like this now what should black do here unquestionably black should play Bishop to E7 and Castle the king but black really hates this bishop and furthermore black wants to be in a Gotham video so to be in a Gotham video you have to violently vomit all over yourself in the middle of a chess game preferably not physically that's a metaphor but if it happens physically I hope you feel better so black plays Knight E5 which is definitely not a good move it's not a good move because you're putting a piece of paper in front of a steamroller like I I this is this is not gonna work it yeah and now is Black's one final moment black is in check the queen has eyes on the pawn the pawn and the bishop and some empty squares over here black can play King F7 which is a scary move but it's actually safe blackened late Bishop E7 which is a scary move because it loses the pawn here but you're up to Bishops and you're about to slaughter the opponent or black can block with the queen and lose the bishop or black can move the king and now white is better yet you put your king in front of your queen and you lose the bishop 400 ELO chess is like The Hunger Games like hey you it's just everyone dies all right and like in untimely ways and the spoiler alert by the way um and uh it's it's just chaos it's by the way now black decides to play this move why now can I just ask why did you find the bishop after the apocalypse happened like why couldn't you have developed the bishop oh I don't know literally at any other moment like maybe here or maybe here or maybe here or maybe here maybe here no you waited for your face to get butchered and then you played this move white brings the rook and now black plays a good move it's been a while but black plays rookie eight I really like this move trying to trade the Rooks this is exactly what you should be doing um white plays Queen takes pawn and now black trades the Rooks I don't hate this but again the reason that white is now significantly better is because black completely did not take care of their King this is a massive weakness whites King is completely safe and uh and and and and white is in great shape but now my friends it is time for it it's it's time for the bad stuff from this point forward what you are going to witness will make you sick or you will laugh so hard your stomach hurts or your stomach will hurt because this game gives you diarrhea I don't know Queen to B6 Queen B6 again that the move Queen B6 is played for the same reason the move F5 was played in it's a one move thought if they take then I take which is why you need to get rid of those bad habits because black played Queen B6 with the following intention when black played the move Queen to B6 the logic was oh if I get taken I take back that was it that was literally the only reason you might as well have snuck out here there is a chance that white actually hangs the rook and coincidentally hangs mate Queen to B6 completely disregards any other queen move and there's a lot of them one two three four five six set like there's a lot of moves eight and and now yeah now Black's in real trouble now black isn't real trouble now Black's gotta run the king because that rook and that Queen they are butchering the king can run and now black finally plays the move Bishop E7 there could not have been a worse moment to play this move I have been begging for the move Bishop to E7 to have been played the entire game black plays the move Bishop E7 unprovoked hanging the bishop completely not only hanging the bishop it's made you're not going to get mated right away you are just simply going to lose all of your pieces but you know if you're a long time viewer of mine or if you've clicked on enough of my videos that there is a plot twist well let's discover the plot twist Queen takes isaf that is not the plot twist Rook takes E7 was the top engine move but the engine can eat a Frank King to C6 Rook to E6 wins the queen it gets played fantastic follow-up the king moves The Rook takes the queen and the King goes here now white wins this game very easily all white has to do and I will actually say this first make sure the king can never get checkmated I don't care if you have a queen I don't care if you can win all my pieces do the right thing and never hang a back rank mate you absolute schmuck if you lose this game by background Checkmate that is inexcusable because the only open file is this if somehow The Rook gets there and then buy a miracle it gets down there you suck you deserve to be whatever ELO you are so just make sure you don't get checkmated promote your Pawn which literally cannot be stopped get rid of this Rook take the pawns don't stalemate promote to a queen get a ladder Checkmate alright or do what white does which is check the black king into a fork that is absolutely boss Behavior you didn't even need you didn't even need to save your back rank because now you literally cannot get back rank checkmated that is perfect play fantastic stuff if you don't want to take all of these pawns don't because if you don't take the pawns they will always have a legal move if you take all of your opponent's pawns you might stalemate them some of you are not good enough to not stalemate so just leave them there and promote and my friends that is exactly what white did Pawn to F6 now black runs the king because I don't know if the king cross is there the king could promote to another king F7 A5 f8 perfect technique it does not get any better than that there is a big future for the person playing with the white pieces white plays A4 and now it's mate in two what you should do in this position is swarm the king with the queen black is down two queens black is also down Five Pawns which means that black is down 23 points of material white here plays this I don't like this move because the king could kind of get tangled in the pawns here but now it's made in one Queen to D6 Checkmate in one move Queen to d8 Checkmate in two moves Queen B8 made made not in one move but definitely in a couple what you should not do is this you're very lucky that's not a stalemate the black king actually has no legal moves in this position but the pawns do which is why it's important to keep the pawns on the board Pawn to A3 now if you were greedy you would take this Pawn but you're not greedy so instead of that you're going to play queen cc6 or queen aa6 Checkmate in one move okay you still have a lot of mates you have Queen here and not in one but in two like plays Queen d8 all right perfect now the King has no legal moves so that's mate that's mate that's made that's okay King before it's still have Queen A5 made but now the king is sneaking in and in this position up 22 points of material and two healthy Queens white played Queen to D4 and lost the game to a pawn promotion back rank checkmate
