i think what's interesting about the metaverse at least early on is it's likely to be some mixture of social vr and and gaming and in fact that's what you'll find to some extent in this world that paul and ed have created the reason for kind of coming in having a chat with you with you about this is facebook kind of pivots to meta and the metaverse you've been dealing with virtual reality and mixed reality for decades now is that right i mean why now this interesting question i mean the meta versus an idea as a kind of an online mass social vr thing and that's been around for a long long time in fact before you really trumped me i was reading neil stevenson's book snow crash 1992 which is where uh in this cyberpunk novel that the term metaverse first comes up um and they've been several attempts to kind of create meta verses over the years second life in active worlds was a kind of big commercial try to roll it out and i guess one of the questions that underlies whether you can do this is about just the infrastructure uh is the world technically ready for it do people have powerful enough computers and devices are the networks fat enough and you know i guess the facebook uh microsoft and others are now banking on the fact that we're pretty much there and we can really roll this out into many many people's homes so who's going to be hosting this meta versus facebook trying to just get the get the jump on people i can't speak for what facebook's business model might might or might not be you'd have to ask them but i mean you know i think it's interesting to think about why the different angles those bigger companies are coming from and as you know as a i guess a social platform company that's invested in vr headsets what six or seven years ago now you know facebook has been positioning themselves for a bit to take the step you know as a company that makes uh computer games and platforms microsoft also might be coming at it from another angle is there a huge amount of server side stuff happening to make this work i mean it's being created in unity i can tell that because it told me when i joined but what's going on server side what's going on client side can you talk us through it the server side handles our communication and moving around so where you see everyone else and also messaging through the shout function whilst client side handles all the looks and how everything is portrayed just to keep things simpler the server side is combining freeze other technologies which is agora for the video and audio that you're hearing mirror networking which is how we're moving the avatars around and a service called pubnub which is for the messaging that you'd see in shouting so there are some technical challenges uh which are quite interesting uh from from a research perspective about how you make this stuff scalable zoom calls teams calls etc they don't scale especially well and they don't scale well for a few different reasons so part of its technical part is about bandwidth how many video feeds can you put on the screen and i i'm part of it's social how do you organize a conversation with a hundred people when only one person can talk at a time and what we were interested here with was how do you take those hundred person teams calls and make them socially functional right when you have a when you have a hundred people in a real room it's not the case that one person talks at a time what happens is people distribute across the room they spread spatially into smaller conversations people whisper in the corners they nudge each other even if you're in a kind of lecture environment there's still a little bit of back channeling going on but in a social environment that's even more necessary for people to be able to form small social groupings and this platform is all about spatializing those video calls being able to go off into a corner but it's actually a little bit more than that because first of all we need to make capable of handling more than a thousand people right imagine a big music festival so we've been looking at small music vessels but imagine a glastonbury where you've got 100 000 people there the problem is everybody wants to go to the stage everyone's going to want to go to where the action is then you've got everybody in the same server where the action is so how do you handle that well our idea was to allow people to create what we call bubbles which is why this system is called bubbles or their own private instances of the world where only they and the people they want to share a video call with and the performers are part of that world you're still aware of everybody else everybody else appears as certain little ghostly avatars but you have this high fidelity communication with just the small group of people that are in your bubble and that creates this really interesting social question of how do you create bubbles how should they be organized is it you know you buy some tickets and as a family group or a friend group you're given a bubble or is it here is a social bubble for dog lovers or a social bubble for people who are specifically interested in drinking guinness or whatever whatever social groupings there might be i think that's quite an interesting uh research challenge for us is to think about how you would structure bubbles how you get people into bubbles because it's both technically necessary to make the system scalable but also socially necessary to make the social situation scalable for me the most interesting thing i think about it is that emerges this kind of digital world with real world social interaction which is the kind of it's the best of both really um so it allows you to participate in social occasions from the comfort of your own home without losing the ability to connect with people on a kind of very human level in a really naturalistic way which i really like yeah i'm not i'd really like this idea of kind of even just looking at the pose of someone you can see if they're looking at you or talking to someone else or paying attention to something else i mean we're kind of using this a little bit like a teams or a zoom call but it's just so much better because i can kind of go over here and talk to steve or i can go and talk to paul or i can go back to talk to ed so there are several core activities here the most important one because it's a festival is the main stage just to show you how that works i'm going to step onto the stage now i'm now a performer and what's happening here is you can all see me regardless of what bubble you're in we've increased the size of my avatar so that i appear on stage as a large onstage performer we've increased the audio quality of my avatar so if i want to play music to you um i can well then come on let's have some music i probably shouldn't come on let's have some music why not should really get steve doing this he's much better at this kind of thing [Music] i should really have tuned my guitar before doing that never mind anyway where's the applause button where is this um media asynchronous media so when you look at a lot of online festivals um they're a mix of live performance and pre-recorded performance and videos um and so we wanted to showcase that in here this is using a set of green screen videos so i'll let you go up to the video yourself because they're locally played [Music] the second video format we wanted to look at was 360 video because here we are in a 3d world why not allow for 360 videos we have these balls and the balls are interesting because they're a way of presenting 360 degree video from the outside and what essentially you do is you walk into one of the balls as you walk in you'll find the video starts to play and you can look around and feel like you're there so you can view them from the sphere outside or go in it's the last is a more kind of standard video where we can walk up to a video and it starts playing one of the companies we're in conversation with at the moment is a circus to look at how you might use volumetric video 3d video capture where you can actually look all the way around the video for yet another kind of form of um embodied content in here when you go to a festival it's not just music right there's more there there are sideshows there are activities and the busy castle and the ferris wheel are there to provide that they're just silly examples but they're very easy to do [Music] so the system already allows you to jump but if you stand in the bouncy castle you can jump a bit higher it's like a bouncy castle except no kids have been sick on it [Music] i think one of the key things about this whole thing is it goes beyond being a zoom meeting or uh you know a team's meeting is it's placeful and you know one of the things we really wanted to create was the festival as a sense of a place that you go to perhaps more than just watching a performance you know all of the other things that you can wander around and spend your time doing and i think that um you mentioned playful we happen to be in um willitton park by the looks of it that's bulletin hall behind you which is some viewers may recognize as it was wayne manor in one of the batman films but that's in nottingham so that's where we are at the moment um but one thing that's quite important for all this sort of stuff is is that idea of the state of the place and does it change if i change something will you see that change so that is our kind of next goal um we have the we have the technology as they say um behind this so we we know we know how to do it we haven't implemented it for this particular version um but one challenge there is how you make that interact with the bubbles system the idea of we're in separate bubbles so how do we sync the the world itself so you can sync objects with this idea that in a specific bubble you should sync the videos the audio the balls in the coconut shy the gondolas and the ferris wheel any kind of physical objects should get synced correctly for a specific bubble but they don't need to be synced for a separate bubble the question you might reasonably ask yourself is what happens if you switch bubbles whose world do you get right if i've got a ball from the coconut shroud rolling across the floor and i join your bubble should i join it where there's no ball rolling over the coconut shower should i bring my rolling ball with me and this is interesting questions about negotiation about ownership of bubbles and that kind of ties right back into metaverse and commercial ownership of the metaverse right so if i own this theme park right then should it be my version of the theme park that everybody gets or do they get to spawn off their own version of my theme park if i build a house in here imagine i'm playing minecraft and i've got to serve if i build a house in the server and somebody hides off a version of that server who owns it at that point and those are real challenges we've seen this before in second life and things like this from a computer scientist you know kind of point of view you know pull something talk about something really interesting when do you want the world state synchronized and when you want it asynchronous and in this kind of environment where it's kind of crowded with potentially lots of strangers but you're also in it with some people that you're sharing it with a small group of friends or family you sort of want both if i go up to the coconut shy i don't want to have to wait for a thousand people to finish with it before i have my go on the other hand if i go up there with you as my mate we want to play together and paul's notion of bubbles that you can get into a little bubble with people and that means you can share audio and video with them and you can share world state i think it's really nice for that as long as my high school follows me steve i don't really mind another kind of tie back to the metaverse the idea of there being virtual real estate that exists when we start playing with this notion of bubbles i can sell the same house 50 times to different people all of whom are having that same address in the same location and just happen to add this bubble to that address and suddenly you get reusable real estate what that will do to those people who want to sell digital real estate is another question entirely but uh i think it's an interesting it's an interesting question i would move between we originally called the system dimensions this idea that you would have several dimensions of the same environment it sounds like all you need to do is add the word blockchain to that and you've got an ipo ready to go have you used this for meetings and things i mean can talk to me about that could this be something some people you know use or jump into so we used it for meetings in its own development um which was an interesting activity because it was it was obviously building as we went along so we were finding errors as we went along and finding quirks as we were went along and working out how much audio attenuation was appropriate and that's when you reduce the volume if you move away from people right absolutely um so yeah we used it we used it for its own meetings we also had our christmas party in it which was quite fun um i dressed the world up for that so we put snow on the ground i replaced the trees with christmas trees we made a snowball fight mechanic um and that's interesting end of itself because so it pulled the pulled the mechanics out of the the coconut shy but allowed to throw the balls at each other and score a point and then we put up a leaderboard uh in in one corner of the room or one part of the space um and it created this extra little layer of things to do in the space specific interaction things to do and a snowball fight's a funny thing because it isn't always between friends you know if you get a snowball fight in a village people will just join in even with strangers um and i thought that was an interesting thing to play with this notion of a a competitive ish but not too competitive game that could just be snuck in to the environment so that if the conversation died down you can just lob a snowball at somebody um which i mean i've been in lots of academic conferences where occasionally i would like to just love a snowball um i think i was talking about this morning actually that the the first five minutes of a zoom meeting or a team's meeting when everybody's waiting for people to arrive there's a rather awkward silence and i like the idea of having a ferris wheel or a coconut shy or a snowball fight just to fill that gap yeah yeah perhaps there just needs to be an alarm to bring you back because of course you won't hear people starting to speak when you're at the other side of the i mean yeah obviously i wouldn't want to contribute to anything that blurs the definition between a party in a meeting that would be a i think a dangerous thing i think as long as you bring your own booze it's absolutely fine people sort of tend to agree in the visions of the metaverse that it's persistent and you know and that means kind of several things it means uh it's kind of always there when you want it but it also means that you can sort of change it and it stays changed and it possibly means that you can own it too and that's been the business model of you know things like second life in the past by real estate in the meta person i think it was very much the idea in the book and then paul's idea of bubbles plays with that in a crazy way because now you can also have parallel versions of the universe that are somehow connected and now question of who owns what becomes much more interestingly complicated but i mean you know just to kind of play devil's advocate people were selling an acre on the moon you know 20 30 years ago i've got an acre on the moon i'm hoping one day i'll get to visit it i mean um this then probably comes down to who owns what server right and and you know feel like there's not going to be the money to be made for the mark zuckerbergs in this world if everything's open source i don't know what do you think there's a slightly more altruistic goal are the mechanics behind what we're doing with this software is to build a platform on which you can overlay this communications medium on lots of existing worlds or worlds that you create so anybody that can build a world in unity ultimately we'll be able to import that world into this space now that is definitely at odds with the notion of a platform that would like everybody to use the same platform and ideally buy bits of it however we're still dependent on third-party technology providers so ed mentioned earlier on that we use agora as our back-end video conferencing system now they have hundreds of servers they have you know significant resource and bandwidth for shipping video around and because they have that they're going to do it better than we could have done it and we are at that point kind of beholden to their servers so there's now a cost associated with running this system which means that we can't simply open source it and say hey everybody go do your own thing because there is actually a bandwidth cost there is a network cost and regardless of whether we ran it ourselves there would be a network and a bandwidth cost so these things can't be entirely free which means there needs to be some degree of commercialization whether that is through a large company like meta facebook microsoft whomever making them available for you know advertising or subscription or whatever or whether that's through us saying here you can have this thing but you will have to pay a subscription to a goer to be able to use it or whether it is us saying okay here's this thing and here's a plug-in by which you can plug zoom or skype or whatever into it and then separate all those feeds there's lots of different ways we might approach the problem yeah i would say you know i'd hope at the very least that you know the protocols for the metaverse will be like with the web uh support interoperability and you know there's been lots of attempts to do that in the past the virtual reality markup language vrml onwards have been attempts for people to define standards for this so you'd hope at that level things will inter-operate fingers crossed kind of thank all of you for joining us today and uh it's been great and i might go off and have a go on the ferris wheel yeah enjoy it thanks very much sean bye so let's look at b we probably don't want to go that way so this is going to be a smaller or bigger wire depending on if you're a mathematician or a computer graphics person so we're going to go this direction now we're looking at e and the problem and i think mike's going to demonstrate this in a second is that log4j is like milk it's like water it's everywhere
