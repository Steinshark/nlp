hi everyone the theme 4043 was sacrifices must be made and I sacrificed my weekend to make a little game where a group of batteries is trying to find a safe home away from humans to get there however some of them have to sacrifice themselves to power the platforms their friends can get across the player has the ability to rewind time and take control of a new battery here for example the battery has to hop onto the platform wait for his friend to provide the power and then jump across to the end platform I started off by creating a simple battery sprite with big innocent eyes of course to make you feel extra bad when they die I then got the battery jumping around and colliding with stuff using the raycast controller from my old tutorial series I wanted to get the cool rewind mechanic working as soon as possible so I started by recording the players keystrokes along with the frame number and then just played those back I was worried doesn't you have the same divergent physics problems that I've had in some of my other projects but I found that as long as i cute the inputs and processed them and all the player and platform movement in a fixed time step then the replays were perfectly consistent to show each platform yet this power from I wanted to generate a hanging wire between two points I thought I'd come up with a pretty good approach on paper but when I implemented in code it sadly turned out to be nonsense my final solution was to apply gravity to each point but then also have the points be attracted to one another this worked okay and I could attach one end to a moving platform like I wanted but it was extremely stretchy together to look right I came up with the hackey approach of just increasing the attraction force the further away the platform was to simulate the wire becoming taut at long last I added the eyes to the battery and made them look in the direction of movement I also made a little battery coffin for the battery to climb engine I then hung the wire between the battery holder in the platform the wire was just rendered with a line renderer so I could control the gradient property from script to make an effect of the electricity traveling up the wire initially I had the batteries use a power with every movement they made which I still quite liked but I was struggling to come up with any good levels so I changed it that the batteries were only drained when powering a platform I still found it a huge struggle to design interesting levels though especially since I only had in platforms to work with I would have liked to introduce more elements but rather like the batteries I was running rather low on energy so to end things off I made a simple gradient texture which I could tint and overlay with others to make this in a little prettier I also made a game of a screen originally featuring a giant smiling battery but ultimately ending with the little batteries just bounding happily across the screen so that in short was my experience with LD 43 thanks for watching Cheers you
