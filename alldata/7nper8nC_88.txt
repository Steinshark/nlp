hello world today in hacking news Google has a gift for cyber criminals a brand new top level domain called dot zip okay just like.com dot net or dot Pizza yes that's a thing you can register a dot zip domain today for just a few dollars a year by the way I haven't got rid of my screen tearing so you know what you guys can all go yourself uh I'll trust me I'll get this way at some point okay at some point I'll get this way one obvious use case for dot zip is a link shortener and someone's already done it this comes with a bit of irony of course thanks to the file type with exactly the same extension you have zip files which expand and now you have zip links which also expand however is that is that irony or is that Serendipity that's not irony it's a disaster no I'm pretty sure that's not I iron it is neither yeah I guess it's not neither because it's not Serendipity because it's not a coincidence so it's it's it's not even dramatic irony it's not irony at all right like I I'd say the only irony would have to happen is that if you got a zip URL the only irony that would exist is that a dop zip IRL URL is longer than all other URL shorteners so it is actually the least shortening of all URL shortening so the thing in which is supposed to make it short and sounds like it's supposed to be the fastest and shortest one is actually the longest and least good one that would be irony but this is just yeah this is just a pun there is a price to pay for this minor amusement and that's because cyber criminals are going to love dot zip Dimensions okay why for example and this is wild let's say you receive a perfectly innocent email from a family member containing some photos but importantly with the file name in the email because dot zip domains are now a thing that's file name becomes a link a bad actor could register a bunch of common file names so that if you mistakenly click the link thinking you're just downloading the attachment you're sent to the website familyphotos.zip which Auto downloads a file of the same name within which there are no family photos just malware by Google introducing this new TLD damn you know between that and the fact that AI can now do voice mimicking really really good like old people are getting screwed right not only are they not going to be able to get their family photos their precious granddaughter is going to call them who's apparently been adopt abducted and is crying for help but it's actually just AI they're gonna get double had in the same day they're gonna get dot zipped these nuts and then dot Ransom to Deez Nuts all at the exact same time foreign honestly if I ever I think that if if you get caught using AI to scam people by by making it sound like their daughter or their granddaughter is ransomed and you're caught with that I think you should just you deserve to be hung that is just so awful yeah people simply stating get them out have potentially been weaponized overnight and it won't surprise you to learn that bad actors are already jumping on the bandwagon there's a GitHub repo which has been tracking newly created zip domains this includes backup.zip archive.zip homework dot zip and thousands of others however some of these you deserve that dude you deserve that if you are a college student or a high school student someone's like hey you want to cheat on the homework homework dot zip and you fall for homework dot zip oh man I hope it gives you the ligma malware deservingly just to buy white hats in order to take them off the market so to speak denying cyber criminals access to them some have been turned into landing pages lambasting Google for introducing the dot zip TLD but there are malicious dot zip domains I've been to Microsoft office.zip I've been to this one I just can't wait to put my credentials in there because it is like it's so exciting you could put credentials in here I almost feel like what would be the truest thing you should do is we should get some sort of distributed Puppeteer to visit this site over and over again and give it Millions of bad credentials to the point where we DDOS these dumb people that'd be great huh be in use such as this one Microsoft Office Dorset which hosts a lovely phishing page however there are other malicious uses of dot zip domains that's already more sophisticated than just waiting for Passive traffic to roll by I found a sneaky method in a medium article which I'll link below there's a bit of an explanation to this one but stick with me because you absolutely have to know about this and I doubt you've seen it before take a look at this URL it links to GitHub and downloads a kubernetes repository in the form of a zip file right well no click the link and you'll be taken to v1271.zip which could be configured by a bad actor to do anything like serve you an infected copy of the tip you work what hold on okay hold on here hold on I got I I got a GitHub so how does that work so we're gonna go to get or GitHub archive refs tags that okay so uh github.com the primogen uh TS zigdy's nuts uh archive tags is that what it is archives tags hold on hold on I gotta see this uh archive or refs tags archive ref tags archive refs tags at yourmom.zip at used to be a credential login it's it's an at anything before the ad is basically wait hold on hold on hold on hold on what am I missing it's fake slashes oh it's fake slashes oh [Music] yeah okay keep watching yeah I'm dumb okay I see what happened here click the link and you'll be talking yeah be configured by a bad actor to do anything like serve you an infected copy of the tip you were expecting but what's going on here clearly The Domain in the URL is github.com yeah let's not touch this you'll see an app in the URL just before the domain now you get the whole oh yeah there's a big red flag and is a sign that the link is taking advantage of a little-known feature of URLs called user info this parameter can be used to specify login credentials for damn you know just looking at that it still blows me away like this is legitimately little known I mean it is a fairly I mean when when people say little don't you got to understand that this individual chat has probably sshed more like statistically type one in the chat if you've used SSH go ahead type one if you use SSH yeah uh that looks nothing like the real world I want you to know my mom doesn't even know what SSH is okay I'd have to go put my SSH keys on your mom's computer if she wishes to SSH into anything okay feel me you feel me okay calm down now okay calm down now we're a web application coding with Lewis I agree this this editing is incredible this is what I yearn for but at the same time I don't yearn for it so you'll automatically authenticated when you're sent to whatever comes after the act however this feature of including login credentials and URLs is more of a legacy feature and doesn't really use much nowadays because people quickly realized that including plain text credentials within a URL is pretty bad for security nevertheless the future lingers in modern browsers yeah so in our malicious URL everything before the at is treated as a user info parameter and you're really sent to v1271.zip instead that's a great hack I mean the link to this very medium article includes an at to specify the author of this article so why doesn't this invalidate.com this is because when the browser sees a slash character in the URL it treats whatever comes after it as a path so you can't really just take any URL and Tack on at arbitrarydomain.zip and expect to be sent there our malicious link however accomplishes this through the use of a certain Unicode card character that looks very similar to a slash but dude Unicode was a mistake okay the fact that there's like that whole Greek question mark That's a semicolon and now slashes that aren't slashes okay I don't I okay I don't get this okay it feels like my world is falling apart constantly without with Unicode okay if we could just go back to just non-unicode days okay ASCII is beautiful okay it has all the characters we ever need including decimal 30 record breaking space okay that's all you need it isn't compare the slashes in our malicious URL to the slashes in an innocent URL there are slightly more of an angle but it's not enough of a difference to set off alarm Bells this all makes possible hyper convincing fishing links that only give away that something just isn't right the true domain appearing in the bottom left when you it's not just that the kerning is all off did you see the look at that look how bad the kerning is that okay well at least you can kind of visually tell that something's effed up turning is a really hard thing you know that we had production issues at workiva who used to be known as web filings because of the enterobang the enterobang okay Kern Deez Nuts is what I have to say to kerning okay the way that something just isn't right here is the true domain appearing in the bottom left when you hover over the link and the fact that some fonts do make the fake slashes look slightly odd but other than that there isn't even an opportunity to realize you're being sent to a malicious domain because as per normal download link Behavior the time if someone ever sends me the email download kubernetes I'll know I'll know right away that whether or not the link is malicious the intent is clearly malicious okay someone trying to get me to learn kubernetes via email I don't think so okay suspicious sus sus okay you should just know by now that nobody is going to be sending you kubernetes links via email until the download starts oh and if you're holding on to hope that this will be fixed by browsers don't a chromium bug report seven years ago raised the issue of Unicode lookalikes and it was decided that nothing would be done this fishing method isn't new per se but it's made a whole lot more useful thanks to Bad actors now being able to serve the exact foul type the victim expects I feel like it wouldn't wouldn't the proper fix quote unquote the proper fix is that any URL with the slash in it should just get Auto URL component encoded and this just make sure that those type of Unicode characters get Unicode encoded they get so you have to do that right so that way you'd automatically see your url all screwed up yeah percent whatever codes yeah whatever they're called so yeah that happens a lot it does happen a lot when I tried even when I tried to do that at sign if you didn't notice that when I tried to do that at sign wherever it was where did I go you'll notice that it did it did it gave me a little percent 40. like it did it for me I don't know uh it would need to encode before you click the URL well I mean it kind of I think I'm not yeah I guess that's true yeah whatever I don't know it sucks it's just it just feels like something this is something that Chrome should like warn you about you know like anyone that's putting their you their username and password this just feels crazy this just feels crazy that we've opened up this huge domain I didn't even know that how bad this was this feels crazy Google has published Hard Times defending venue zip domains in which they said the risk of confusion between domain names and file names is not a new one they give the example of the.com TLD which actually used to be a file extension in the early days of Windows it was similar in function to dot exe however that's a bit of an absurd comparison because you'd have to go back to the first half of the 90s to find Stockholm files being used regularly to imply that just because it didn't pose a problem then that it won't now that is an incredible Windows logo if 3.5 really get I never did how beautiful that is you guys remember the old days of booting up starting in DOS and then you'd actually have to type in win and go into windows so good I installed Doom Doom took five separate five separate uh floppies to get it installed five okay five it was so good it was so good Windows 2K is the best no it's not so good okay I loved it I was installing Doom I was eight years old put or not even eight I was like six years old putting doom on my computer blasting bad guys beautiful time oh it's ridiculous the number of people connected to the internet back then was Tiny it barely registers on a graph and cybercrime wasn't the multi-trillion dollar industry that it is today the rest of Google's statements I only played Duke Nukem because I thought I could see some titties okay Real Talk Doom was fun Duke Nukem was for the hope of seeing titties okay when I was a little kid I was exposed I was exposed to porn at a very young age and I truly just wanted to see more titties that's all I wanted as a young kid and so that's why I played Duke Nukem we all know it okay we all know it to be true okay we all know it don't even try with me doom on the other hand you played because you want to kick some caca Demon's ass okay little Kaka demons or whatever sound they make [Music] they make that stupid sound you just make you just want to shoot him with the rocket launcher constantly what's that dumb sound they make oh my goodness I just hate it here I'll manly up my voice a little bit [Music] so stupid it's just waffle really thought zip isn't the only newly created TLD there's also.mov which has also proved PhD sharing the same extension now did you see that what dude if someone showed me their dot PhD website because they have a doctorate I would unfriend them on Facebook if I had a Facebook account got a marks Zuckerberg please don't practice your Brazilian Jiu Jitsu on me though controversial again thanks to a file type sharing the same extension now I want to hear your guys's thoughts on all of this is the existence of dot zip a dumb idea I mean there's already 1500 tlds do we really need any more in particular confusing ones or is the drama just hype and so long as developers Implement some basic changes like not Auto hyperlinking.zip domains we'll all just be fine let me know your thoughts down in those comments this video is sponsored by PCB way I'm gonna I'm gonna give him some thoughts and then I I will we'll watch his sponsorship because you know that's the nice thing to do here but I do want to give some thoughts here really quickly on this do I think it's bad I think the thing is is that Google should put in some protections the browser should put in some protections if you follow a link that is a dot zip like there's an entire class of people that will just be had by it every time it does not matter you are had 100 of the time and I think taking the time to protect people against that would be a good idea right like if you go to a non-secure place or a place that has bad https credentials they're like absolutely it's terrible proceed with caution this is this is dangerous right so you would think that hey you know maybe if if you go to a dot zip that downloads something right away maybe you should consider just maybe like putting up a little bit of a warning for somebody that could be nice for them right uh I think this that you could save you could save a lot of people that aren't tech savvy obviously everyone in here very very tech savvy they're probably gonna get had by this anyways go because you go want to go watch Family photos.zip Classic maneuver really solution for particular PCB fabrication and on-demand 3D printing needs from standard pcbs to more advanced
