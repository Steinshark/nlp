a high refresh rate monitor a carbon fiber gaming mouse a force sensitive keyboard money everyone knows that these are the things that you need to be a great gamer or that's what PC companies want you to think Razer Logitech Nvidia they all want you to feel like you need to spend big to win big but do you to find out we built the most try hard PC setup possible buying into every single claim frame and mind game the PC Hardware manufacturers pitch and we're gonna see how much of an edge we really get compared to the average PC which you know parts are actually worth splurging on and which are a total waste of money you know let's talk Hardware naturally we gotta start with the best the beastly Intel Core I9 13900k and the Behemoth Asus Rog strix 4090 because frames win games we've proven it and these two pretty much always get the most frames to manage all that power and heat we've gone with the fractal torrent equipped with a 420 millimeter nice AIO from Corsair 740 millimeter noctua industrial fans and three nff 12s at the bottom of the case for fresh air to our GPU which we then exhaust through the front mounted radiator where we've removed the dust filters entirely for better airflow finally we swapped out the stock retention bracket for a thermal Grizzly bracket to give us a few more degrees of cooling on the CPU and up in the attic lives our power supply from sea Sonic who sponsored this video we chose their PX 1300 because it's 80 plus Platinum certified and so even at 20 load this thing will be at worst ninety percent efficient and all their new psus in the PX lineup come with a 12 volt high power connector so you don't need this stupid octopus adapter when you put in the 4090. for the motherboard we are using the EVGA z790 dark Kingpin motherboard specifically meant for extreme overclockers notice that the ram has been moved up to the top of the board this is specifically to reduce the distance from the CPU to improve the timings we've used the onboard utility to overclock our CPU to 5.8 gigahertz across all cores for that extra oomph you know and of course we have ample fast storage in the form of 10 terabytes worth of PCI Express Gen 4 and vme ssds okay now for peripherals our Guiding Light is latency reduction latency is the time between input and eventual output and is the enemy of good gaming every single piece in this setup is focused on reducing the time between targeting the enemy seeing his head replaced with a thin Red Mist source of latency in your system is likely going to be the display a typical 144hz gaming display introduces a whopping 6.94 milliseconds of latency comparing that to the 390 Hertz of the Acer Nitro X the fastest monitor on the market today where each frame is displayed for just 2.56 milliseconds this Nets us a nearly 4.38 millisecond reduction that is if you can run your games that fast in scenarios where performance is CPU limited like we are preventing us from running all of our games at 390 frames per second you might want to consider the Asus Rog Swift pg27 aqn which is 1440p and 360 Hertz meaning you can trade 30 Hertz for extra image Clarity we have both here but to reduce GPU overhead we'll be unplugging our second monitor while gaming and for peripherals the azound Konig m2k uh okay this is the m1k but they were all out of n2ks and this uses the same sensor and switches so for our purposes it works at just 24 grams you are basically holding nothing this mouse doesn't waste time with side buttons or even most of the mouse what it does have is two clicks and a scroll wheel for well the m2k has a scroll wheel and 8 000 Hertz polling rate which means that your inputs will be delayed at most 0.125 milliseconds eight times faster than other piddly Gamers thousand Hertz pulling rates and if you simply cannot stand the shape then maybe recommend the more Normie Razer Viper eight kilohertz while it does come in at nearly three times the weight of the Zone Konig it has the same polling rate and sensor and it is a lot easier to buy we're using a glass mouse pad for maximum slideage feels like you're moving on nothing at all nothing at all nothing at all damn sexy Flanders our keyboard is the Wu Ting 60 he what makes this so special is that each switch is actually an analog input meaning we can do things like partially push our keys down to walk rather than run and we can set our actuation point to 0.1 millimeters a typical key switch actuates at around 1.5 to 2 millimeters into the keystroke so that takes about five milliseconds more for that key press to register just by the force of the action alone by setting our actuation point so much higher our key presses will register 15 to 20 times faster than the competition just 0.25 milliseconds the catch is that our keyboard only has a thousand Hertz polling rate meaning that the average latency will still be one millisecond the only way we could improve this is if the next revision adds 8 000 Hertz pulling what makes this action for gaming is that it's an optical instead of a mechanical switch meaning there's no debounce delay at all so as soon as you unpress a key it's instantly unpressed to ensure that no inputs get lost in the high polling rate Fray we plug their devices into different USB controllers on our motherboard you can use your motherboard manual to see which ports are managed by each controller oh wait there is one other input that we forgot to talk about our foot pedals we can't afford to move our fingers away from those Wallace keys so we got elgato's stream deck foot pedals to quickly and easily map some of our less time critical inputs to things like reloading or taunting the polling rate on this is not nearly as high as we would hope but we might be able to overclock the thing for a little bit lower latency but that's a whole other can of worms finally we have our audio solution for the clearest comms we went with an Electro Voice re20 with the dynamite preamp connected to our audient Evo interface for the front end we went with the Sennheiser HD 800s for its incredible Sound Stage which allows us to pinpoint the footsteps of our enemies with ease oh yeah and we even got the ultimate gaming router the Asus Rog Rapture a quad band gaming router that has tweaks to optimize Network traffic for gaming oh and uh naturally we have the Herman Miller embody gaming chair from Maximum ergonomics and comfort we also made some tweaks like we disabled background processes like Windows Defender which is always a good idea we've disabled Wi-Fi on the motherboard to reduce Emi and CPU interrupts we've turned on multi-core enhancement set Windows to GPU accelerated scheduling and ultimate performance power plan set XMP on and we've given our CPU and GPU a slide overclock to get a little bit of extra performance we aren't pushing too hard as stability is Paramount for the sweaty tryhard gamer okay enough Theory crafting let's see if all of this is worth it by testing it with real Gamers and by Gamers we mean Linus sub no wrong one oh get out of here we're going to compare our two setups this is the most average gaming PC we've made one upgrade a 144 Hertz monitor sure we're going to compare that to the full try hard setup the sweatiest gaming pieces absolutely get your bearings here enjoy it play a game with the most common peripherals the typical kind of experience I a desk mat from lttstore.com is there anyone else on this map am I is there supposed to be people in the fight or wants to get out of here there's no Bots what about the L Jake okay just press Escape go start a bot match or you can play a real match and see how you do I never used to feel like the g502 was Heavy it's kind of heavy by today's standards I use a G Pro Wireless at home and it's a lot later okay oh shoot wow uh okay that was probably the heavy Mouse uh it was probably because of the heavy Mouse nope Oh shoot no come on come on ah shoot oh sh no ah come on oh hold down tab that's where you are on the leaderboard well you know what it's hard you know he was at the very bottom okay it is hard yeah it's hard what if we could upgrade your game alright let's try the upgrade all right welcome to the try hard setup 999 frames per second this is the mouse yes it weighs but 23 grams wow okay and we have you equipped with the wooting 60 HP whoa this is like a hair trigger keyboard because it's an optical and analog switch you can set the actuation point as high or as low as you want I've set it to 0.1 millimeters so that the moment you want to make an action you go it also has rapid trigger so the moment you relieve any pressure from the key it just stops sending a signal you don't have to wait for it to cross back over the actuation point again pretty cool what is this doing here so that's your for your comms for your team and also we equipped you with the best headphones you could find for Sound Stage okay I should definitely try without sound first for Apples to Apples here is this a 390 Hertz monitor it is it's the fastest monitor currently on the market okay okay got him come on he's right there what do you mean I only hit him three times okay here I have a solution no you're getting clammy hammed you need to use gamergu which flavor would you like oh I'm liking the weight of this mouse I'm not liking the shape very much but not gonna lie kind of actually feeling it okay what's the gamer goo fine orange peppermint uh we'll put some on your hands so you can get improve your grip it's kind of a shiny Mouse this is chaos also we've brought you some ghost gamer neuotropics what I don't know so a nootropic it's a brain enhancing chemicals these are all legal what are you even talking about I'm trying to enhance your performance Linus well it's not going to do anything instantly well I should have taken it 15 minutes ago because that's the amount of time it takes for caffeine to kick in that's the important thing to know about all of these the actual thing that matters is the caffeine so you can just dry scoop it right now if you want um sure wow I'm gonna get him some water oh God he's gonna die I'm fine very unpleasant not recommended honestly there's too much Randomness with just people being flipping everywhere in this tip okay let's go into aimlab um just for steam it's right there no I won't oh my God how do I even oh my God I don't have a mouse wheel I don't know how to use a computer without a scroll wheel how do you actually well the good news is that the newer version of this mouse does have a scroll wheel but the company only makes a certain amount every year and they ran out they're like two guys they're working really hard okay all right all right I'm probably not going to do very well oh yeah I definitely feel sweatier I'm a sweatier gamer for sure okay 68 accuracy so I am above average barely which means that you'll probably be worse when you're not performance enhanced but I should have more caffeine in my system with my heavy ass Mouse here all right I got better okay now I want to go back and try this test over here what what did I get that time or wait I guess it's a different test yeah 45 000. okay all right familiar with the test now okay let's try the sweaty setup 49 297. that's it that's an improvement yes barely probably just me doing the test three times would account for that much improvement but uh Hey 69 kill total nice oh yeah just so you know this computer uh this whole setup it's uh it's eleven thousand dollars this one is about uh it's about 600. so that extra ten thousand four hundred dollars probably better invested in some coaching yeah yeah or practice practice but that's not that's not the point pay yourself to practice but what'd you think what do you think about some of these parts do you think that any of these actually make a huge difference like this is a huge difference maker for me yeah yeah oh yeah scores and tests aside which are affected by a human element what is the actual difference in latency between one system and the other on this system the average end-to-end latency so from click to when you see something happen on your screen that's 12 milliseconds really yeah which is a lot faster than the average PC which is 26 milliseconds and yet I still can't really feel the difference between them huh we are really at a point of diminishing returns here aren't we especially when you consider like human reaction speeds and stuff like that is it like around 180 to 280 millisecond range you're talking about a less than a tenth of your own human reaction speed right but in the event where two people across the planet click at the exact same time this system is going to win out pretty much every time I haven't gotten all five of them a single time ah if you like this video why don't you watch the one we did on the most average gaming PC since that's really all you need evidently
