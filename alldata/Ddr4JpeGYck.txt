hey everybody what's up i got my friend kailash on the show today and he's a software engineer at microsoft we've got some really really cool ideas in this podcast but this is a podcast okay so it's gonna actually be a pretty long interview now what i suggest you do is bump this video up to like one and a half or two times speed and then listen to the whole thing so maybe put it on while you're cooking maybe put it on while you're doing some other work there's some really really cool stuff in here if you want to get your next internship you want to listen to this so uh without further ado yeah i wanna i wanna just ask you to to talk a little bit about your background and uh introduce everybody to to who you are and what you work on right okay so my name is kyla singh moria and i'm a software engineer at microsoft and i've worked with the bing ads team i'm part of a really big organization and i'm part of one of the teams that which helps perform simulations so we we work with and we play with data science models and i'm one of the members of the team so i'm it's really exciting working with so many smart people every day um and i've been there for almost six months now uh with microsoft before working with microsoft i was working with amazon i was working on alexa and all of their alexa announcements product it was really amazing so that's what i've been doing at microsoft yeah and my past working history wow um and so how long have you been in the the tech industry since graduation um so i graduated in may of 2018 so i've been in the tech tech industry for on around two years yeah but before working uh before this i was also working in india so i worked with a software company for almost two years back in india before coming to the states yeah right and you got your your master's at usc is that right yes i got my master's at usc yes so um just to let everybody know like i i came across an article that you wrote a few weeks back and more or less i thought it was absolutely incredible um how you managed to get yourself an internship uh just by you know tearing down roadblocks um and so it was all kind of around this idea of automating the process of of internships so do you want to talk to me about kind of how you you got to that point you came to that idea absolutely absolutely so while i was a student at usc and um so i i started my master's degree in 2016 and uh the moment you get into a master's course um one of the major focus of uh you being there is to find an internship so students they start applying to internships right from their first semester um and because you've got two semesters so if you if you join into the fall program you have around two semesters to get a get an internship because everyone does a summer internship right so right when you start working or start your master's program everyone's applying you've got career fairs so i did all that so i talked to my seniors i talked to a lot of people i went to the career center at usc getting more information and tips uh polishing my resume i did so many things you know and then everyone has been doing that so everyone said that okay you should go to networking events you should increase your net network um so i've been working on linkedin and uh a lot of stuff that everyone has been doing but even after doing all of that a lot of people was were telling me and even i was experiencing the same thing that oh you know what the number of callback or the number of interviews that everyone is get is getting is is really low so the amount of efforts and the time that you put in to uh apply to software positions or soft internship positions versus the results that you were getting that was really low and i was like this is some we're missing something we're we're probably not doing it the right way maybe it's the resume or maybe is it the process or is it uh people start to question if it's if it's them like maybe they're not good enough so all of those things they start to play with you and they really affect your motivation of applying to software companies so uh start from the first semester um i attended career fairs we used to have a lot of career affairs at usc um around 100 150 software companies would come and their hr representatives would come and we would stand in long lines and would stand there for hours and hours just to get that two minutes without right everyone does that now you've got hundreds of people standing in one line uh talking to one recruiter or one hr person now that hr person is going to talk to hundreds of candidates every day now how do you stand out right right impression and you only get two or three minutes to talk so it is really hard to make an impression there i hardly got any interviews from that um from those career fairs i got maybe two or three uh out of uh maybe four or five career fairs that i attended yeah it was really it was really low so um so i've been attending the career fairs i've been also attending networking events now a lot of students don't do that a lot of students may probably just apply online um they would reach out to recruits on linkedin but they don't do the networking events they don't attend the networking event and in my experience it has been really amazing it has been really um it opens your mind and also a lot of people are shy they're not so open to you know just walk into a networking event where you don't know anyone and just stop talk to a finger introduce yourself so if it even if it doesn't get you an interview it still teaches you a lot about how to share or how to talk to strangers and how to create connection within that that 10 minutes right so those were the things um apart from just applying online i was still doing you know i was applying i was going to networking events career fairs i was reaching out to recruiters on linkedin um and then i was applying online as much as possible um but in retrospect i saw that you know what this process or all of the things that i'm doing it's not giving me enough results and i need to take that back i need to do something else yeah so i thought okay what is the one thing as you've read my article i i explain all the pain points right and then why we're doing certain things and why these are not working so i try to understand how it actually works so what happens is when you apply to a software position um all the major tech companies they use ads applicant tracking system right it's and they run uh algor they run an algorithm to uh rank or uh create a relevant score between your resume versus your um okay subscription right yep because even for them they get thousands of application even for one position right so they also need some sort of automation or algorithm to filter out and it's fair right because you've got so many people applying um it is impossible for a single recruiter or maybe uh one hr person to sort through all of those resumes so i thought okay so they use this system um i should maybe work on improvement improving and personalizing my resume so i started doing that i used to personalize all of my resumes and i had access to this one tool called job scan and job scan would help me calculate the relevance of my resume versus the job description yeah i was able to calculate a score like okay um i'm getting a 60 match between my resume and the in the job description so maybe i should tweak a bit i should change some keywords i should uh maybe instead of this project i shouldn't mention that project because it is more relevant to this job description so i did all of those things right and then i would start personalizing my resume and then applying i did that and even after doing that uh i was not able to see major um change in the results that i was getting in the callbacks um so i thought okay maybe i i um maybe i need to improve my numbers right so i talked to one of my usc professors and he said it's it's all a game of numbers the more company you apply to the better are your chances of getting an interview right so i thought okay like um i wanna skip the ads all together right i'm not able to break it down even after personalizing my resume i'm not able to go through that eds filtration system or the or increase my chances of getting an interview so maybe you know what i need to talk to humans actual humans you would not you would not realize it but we are surrounded by algorithms uh all over the day uh when you interact with maybe facebook or in or or google you are surrounded by um algorithms and in some ways they have an impact on how your life goes or how you you live your whole day so i thought okay maybe i should try something else i should i want to reach out to actual recruiters or actual people working at the companies that i want to work with and i said okay what can i do um and then i i had this i had a couple of ideas and as you read in the article i tried some of them so one of the major ideas that i had was to create a bot that would apply to software companies on my behalf and i will just say you know what i just want to target software engineer jobs uh software engineer internships in los angeles so these were two or three parameters i would give insert the resume or give it the resume as an input and then tell the automation or the bot to apply to positions on my behalf um if you're if you're aware uh there are a lot of ui automation tools for example selenium right yeah it can help you automate a lot of ui stuff and you don't have to do it manually and i thought maybe i can do that but the challenge with that approach was that application process for every company is different they they all use a different tool to apply or to manage applicants so some of the people may be using zip recruiter some of them may be using their own personal career portal um everyone is different so the challenge that i saw with that approach was that i would have to teach my bot uh to learn the application process of every different company and it would vary a lot defeating captchas remembering a master set of questions um and all a lot of different stuff it was really complex and i didn't have so much time right so i thought of other approaches so maybe okay um i'm doing this one thing i'm reaching out to recruiters on linkedin so what i do is i search for that recruiter um or maybe just internship recruiters or software engineering recruiters at microsoft and amazon at cisco and all of those things i was doing this over and over again and then i thought okay you know what this there should be a way to automate this just like any other software engineer if it takes for you five minutes to do something all the software and you're saying how can i automate this yeah exactly so many memes on that which is hilarious but yeah i thought that okay i think i can automate this process you know uh and i started working on in python script uh i had i had some experience with selenium working in um just had i known that selenium exists uh it is something that people use for ui automation and i thought okay maybe i can use this so i wrote a script it didn't take me a lot it didn't take me more than a day it was super fast it was just a basic script so i wrote a script used selenium and i said okay you know what i gave it the list of 100 companies and that bot would run and send connection requests to recruiters um on my behalf and it was just done in maybe i don't know an hour or so i think an hour or so so yeah within an hour i had hundreds of uh linkedin requests sent out to recruiters and within a week i was able to add 100 plus recruiters to my network wait so can i can i ask a question here so i i love using selenium to to automate this process i actually recently started using selenium to automate like my own website stuff and uh it's actually really easy it's really useful you just have to know a bit of css selector stuff and you can start jumping in so what my question is so i i did this automation task with selenium and i i was basically it was like a twitter bot or something and it was like following people right and the problem is that after a certain point it's like you follow like 60 people or something they throttle you like they block you and say you've sent too many connection requests so my my question is how did you not get blocked doing that yes absolutely so so i did this experiment in maybe 2017 right so i'm i'm not sure if they had all of those uh blocking techniques uh or maybe their throttling limits were higher so i uh i also implemented a rate limiter and also uh some sort of randomization so what happens is if you send connection requests to a lot of people in a very short amount of time uh they may consider that as automation they they are smart enough to recognize that it's not a human running the website it's it's a bot right so yeah so to to tackle that sometimes you have to implement a rate limiter so that you don't exceed your connection request limit uh although there is no limit um but they have some limits in order to identify if it's a human of it if or if it's the bot right so make sure you don't exceed that um i've also um in in 2017 maybe their systems were not that good enough so i didn't get blocked i didn't get throttled uh that much um so maybe i did that in a good amount of time but if you try if you want to do it now i would suggest understanding the throttling limits and how they recognize uh if it's a bot operating the system uh and stay well below that limit and also put a daily limit so okay maybe i'll only send a follow request to 30 people a day and then resume doing that next day so yeah maybe you can implement that that would help yeah and what i found also for for me is that um when i was running the script to test it a lot of the times i was like logging in a lot um just to get it to work and so what i did is i created an additional account just for like you know getting kind of the scripts to work in the first place before i started running it on my personal account because i figured if i was to run it on my personal one then they would ban me and then it's just game over right there you know absolutely absolutely yeah that's a really smart thing that's the really smart thing and i've done that before one of the instagram accounts that i was automating so absolutely you want to do all of your testing on a completely separate account um and then once your script is absolutely ready and it's doing what you expect it to do uh it stand when when you use it with your account so you it's not fun getting blocked on linkedin it's not fun getting bloggers because you build a network you build your own uh people and all of your posts and activity they're all associated with your account so i would recommend people who whoever are trying um try it just like what you did create a test account perfect your script and then actually use it on your um personal account right well thanks for answering that so let's uh where were we where do we leave off so yeah so i wrote that linkedin bot i was able to add hundreds of recruiters to my network but the problem is that approach was everyone was doing it right no one um it was not making me stand out it it was not something that would um immediately grab attention of the recruiter right so everyone was doing that thousands of people connect with a single recruiter every day looking for internships and i see a lot of people doing that mistake and i did the same thing um if a recruiter would uh send out a opportunity post i would say i would just comment with one text with one word interested and that's it and then i've made all of those mistakes and i've learned that it doesn't work you've got to have a different approach yeah so i was reaching out to the recruiters on linkedin but i was just gonna be yet another candidate uh reaching out to that particular recruiter i'm still running into that issue where thousands of people talk to one recruiter and it's hard to make an impression it's hard to stand out because that funnel is already very occupied or or it's already saturated with a lot of cabinet candidates so okay so i thought okay maybe i need one another thing i think maybe i need to get into um i need i need them to read my resume right that was my ultimate aim like if only they can read my resume and not my resume doesn't get filtered by ads i just want them to just bypass ads and make them read my resume so i thought a couple of ideas and i saw my um every day we get this emails by a lot of people we mean we may have subscribed to them we may have not subscribed to them but we get this cold email right from a lot of people and cold calling whole emailing approach um i was not that aware of and i had no idea how to do that or what what it is in the first place so i read a couple of articles i read how you're supposed to write and or craft an email before you cold call or cold email someone and um i i got to know like okay maybe this is something that i can do if i can just get the email ids of the recruiters or the people working at those companies uh and send them my resume like pitch myself send them my resume um maybe maybe just maybe i can get them to read my resume and the good part about that is you're bypassing ads you're increasing your chances of getting your resume reviewed by the recruiter because you're not getting um stuck in that algorithm or that funnel uh also um you're skipping you're like trying to access a back door now to get into any of this any of the maybe a restaurant or a bar you know there's always a back door you can always get in you may see people standing in long lines outside from the front entrance bus but there's always a back door which can get you in and within minutes so i thought okay you know what this email marketing or this emailing call emailing is my way of getting in from the back door so i thought okay how can i get the emails like i have no idea how can i get the emails i've seen um i've seen um a lot of places um but they have their old website set up and then maybe like a newsletter and then they they ask you if you're interested in our newsletter sign up send your email and then that's how you subscribe to them and i thought i don't have something like that i don't have a website i don't have something that people can subscribe to i'm not creating content so i thought okay how can i get like how can i still get it um so i was all i used to watch a lot of y combinators videos and i used i was fascinated i'm still fascinated by all of the founders all of the entrepreneurs who are um part of the y combinator program and how they built their business and how to build a business and all of those things and i was really amazed by everything they do so i was just exploring y combinator's website and i remembered you know what there was a section where they mentioned a list of all the companies they've sponsored or they've invested in till date and in 2017 it that number was around a thousand today if you see there are around 2000 companies that are invested uh that y competitor had invested in so i thought okay okay okay okay i got it so i have a list of companies i have a thousand companies and definitely they would mention some sort of email on their website right maybe a support email or maybe maybe a ceo's email so maybe some developers email so i thought okay i think i can i think i can do one thing i can write a scraper that can visit all of those websites parse the html content of those web pages and i have used the rejects email rejects that would filter from the html content or only the email ids and then i said okay i think maybe this can work this can actually work so i wrote a scraper and yet again scraper uh or even the automator on all of those tools or all those scripts are super easy if you know computer science every anyone can do it it's not that hard so i wrote that scripture in just one day and i gave the list of a thousand companies as input from the y combinator's website and um i wrote this paper such that it would visit each of the thousand websites and it would visit visit uh two levels deep into that website from the home page so visit the homepage gather all of the urls that are mentioned on that homepage and then visit that and then do the same thing right so do that for two levels deep so i did that for a thousand websites the scraper executed or ran for seven or eight hours by the end of seven or eight hours uh i saw um i went to sleep i got up and then i saw the result and then i saw that in the results i had around more than thousand email ids and i was crazy i thought whoa this is awesome this i actually got email ids from so many people um and i was super pumped i was super excited you know one of those projects which in which you are so focused and so enthusiastic and excited about that it doesn't let you sleep and it doesn't let you you don't feel sleepy at all so i was working on that thing for almost like four or five a.m straight nons without any um without any drowsiness or any sleepiness and then when when it finished execution i had around more than thousand email ids i filtered through all those email ids manually uh and there were a lot of invalid email ids i've mentioned that on the article as well there were a couple of invalid email ids as well so i filtered them out i had a bunch of around 850 um valid email ids then i had access to usc's smtp server so one of those smtp server i explored the unix mail command in which you just type mail the recipient email id the text or the email content and that's it and the smtp server would send an email on your behalf to that recipient email id and when you receive that email id uh when you receive that email in your inbox you wouldn't feel as if it was sent by a bot or it was sent by an automation tool you would feel as if i've sent you cannot detect that it was sent by a bot so you would feel that it was sent by me personally so i created my content i was i pitched myself i included links for my resume my projects my git up and everything i used bitly so that you can get statistics on how many people clicked that link because i wanted to track how many people read my resume and what was the success rate success rate of me doing that so i did all of that created the content executed another python script to send 850 emails they were all sent within a minute and then within just um within just 10 or 15 minutes of it my my email account was flooded by with around 50 or 60 emails from gmail saying that they were unable to deliver email to that particular email id so it turns out there was a couple of email ids that were not valid or they were maybe terminated or there was something wrong with them right so i i got to know about them uh and then okay after this um i started seeing people actually reading my resume i was also monitoring my bitly statistics or how many people opened my resume how many people have read it and uh i started getting replies from people and i got all sorts of replies like okay there were like four different types of replies they were like how did you reach out to us how did you find this people some people are surprised like how did you find us another one was oh we don't have any internship positions but thank you for reaching out uh third one was i didn't realize that i had actually sent uh my email to support email ids you know you know when people get uh if you are a startup you have a support email id and people would email you on that email saying that you know what i'm facing certain issue with your product and i would need your help with this so those were the email ids and i didn't realize that i forgot to filter those email ids from my list right right so when i sent the email i got replies from people uh saying that oh this is not the right channel this is uh for the support but there were few people who were the support engineers who forwarded my resume to the hr or to the right person to look at and that gave me a really interesting perspective that was a really interesting learning that even though you may think that certain people may not help you or certain channels are not are dedicated for certain things um there are always people willing to help you right you just have to reach out to them so those were the things that are really learned by those examples and then the other bunch of people um who replied who were surprised that i reached out to them some of them were not even from united states some of them from were from maybe um china or maybe they're from lisbon or they were from um uh kenya or all different parts of um the world and i i that's when i realized that y combinator in the west invests in companies all over the world i i thought that i had this assumption that they only invest in usa so for other types of replies i got i started getting replies with people who read my resume and they were interested they really liked the work that i had done and it kind of aligned with what they wanted and what they were looking for in an internet so i set up a couple of interviews uh after that and um fast forwarding i got an internship with uh uh a drone startup or or an autonomous airplane delivery company it's it's called valencia it was in san francisco and they use autonomous airplane or maybe now they focus on drones to deliver payloads anywhere you want so i was super excited because i was talking directly to the co-founders to get the uh to get my internship or to interview with them so uh it was something very amazing that the single piece of code that i wrote uh and it just took me a day or two to finish uh it actually gave me um an internship and put me in touch with the co-founders and directly talk to them and pitch myself to them so that was an interesting um experiment that i did in which i tried to figure out you know what there's something wrong with or there's something not working with the current way i'm applying to positions and internships i need to do something else i need to do do something to escape all of the competition i need to find a way to get in get my foot into the company right to get put into the company using the back door so i'm so glad that i did that and it actually helped me uh reach out and be more visible to a lot of people so it's important to see uh if you're doing something and if you're not getting the results you need to take a step back and understand how you can change something use technology uh to to make your life better right yeah so that's that's what i did yeah yeah i love that i love that um you know you found a way to to make yourself stand out and uh for for people listening you know it's not the only way to to make yourself stand out like i could think of going even more personal where you if it wasn't coveted uh just show up at the office and be like here's my resume let me give it to someone like put it on your desk there it is you know that's another way that you can make yourself stand out right absolutely um and i also like what you said about how some support engineers just forwarded your email which makes me think about the automation of linkedin that you did at the beginning and think maybe you were a little bit uh too assumptuous when you only connected with recruiters because that would be the normal way into a company but if you'd connected with regular engineers for all you know they would have forwarded your resume onto the hr reps and it would have been more personal exactly and that's something that i missed and i should have done that and i should have used my linkedin bot to actually target the people right or the people working because they they don't get a lot of people reaching out to them for um positions sometimes people do right but if you actually target maybe the hiring manager or maybe the the person who actually works in that team they can look at your resume and they can actually tell their hiring manager or their manager that i came across a good profile i came across a good resume and a lot of times what used to happen is while i was working in amazon we used to have um some positions that uh our team was hiring for and our manager would tell us like if you have some good candidates send them my way right so there are a lot of people uh in every company and in which um they're they're looking to hire people they're looking to hire smart engineers now if there's a way you were aware of that opportunity um you could have got that interview right so if you directly interacted with the engineer or the hiring manager um so instead of in addition to running the linkedin bot with recruits only you can run it for software engineers uh hiring managers and that would be really good it would help you to stand out like because what happens is when you apply to positions uh it goes through ads then there's recruiter then there's hiring manager right so the recruiter filters and sorts and kind of gets the top 10 from the list of uh resumes then it forwards that to um the hiring manager now if you can find a way to directly reach the hybrid manager skipping all of that that is interesting right so this is one of the ideas that i think would be helpful is if you're interested in a position try to find a contact from inside from within that company and try to identify who the hiring manager is once you get the hiring manager reach out to the hiring manager directly and impress him or impress her right and i'm pretty sure that would increase your chances of getting reviewed and getting a interview because if you impress that person he would be he would be more interested in talking directly to you right so you right a whole lot of filtration and competition directly reaching out to um hiring manager yeah wow that's that's a fantastic story i'm glad that like in the end um you know you ended up getting that internship that you really desired so that was really cool absolutely all right so thanks so much for being on the show absolutely thank you so much for having me i've heard all the other podcasts and they're really amazing so you're doing a great job keep doing it you're helping a lot of interns so thank you for having me thanks so much hey guys i really hope you enjoyed that i mean i definitely did so thanks so much for joining today and i'll see in the next episode
