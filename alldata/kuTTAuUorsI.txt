thanks to HubSpot CRM for sponsoring a portion of this video in its own words the chat GPT chat bot from openai is a force to be reckoned with in the world of language processing Ai and they might be onto something ask it seemingly any question and it responds in fluent English with the ease and confidence of the smartest person you've ever met or maybe the most arrogant since it does get things very wrong sometimes in spite of its shortcomings it has already proven to be an extremely powerful tool for creation code Snippets poetry and even simulating a Linux virtual machine are all possible if it's in the mood it can even generate Linus Tech tips video scripts I mean not in a way that will replace our writing staff anytime soon in fact I'm pleased to announce that I will be paying my writing team double their current salaries this is a testament to their hard work and wait what who put that in the chat bot you were supposed to ask it if it could help me build a PC the rules today are simple then I have to do everything the AI tells me as if I have no PC Building knowledge whatsoever I mean what could go wrong but enough about this let's take a moment to thank our sponsor for supporting this program and making it possible for us to bring you this Innovative technology thanks to HubSpot CRM for sponsoring this portion of the video HubSpot is an all-in-one CRM platform that makes it easy for your team to stay aligned learn more about them later in the video thanks to HubSpot for sponsoring that portion of this video building a PC can be a fun and rewarding experience and I'll be happy to help you through the process here's a list of basic components you will need to build a PC case power supply motherboard CPU Ram it even explains what CPU and RAM are wow not only is this response coherent well-formatted and encouraging you can do it doing unfortunately if I didn't already know how to build a computer it probably wouldn't help me that much but if you run into difficulties or have any questions along the way don't hesitate to ask for help this ability to go back and forth with the user allowing them to refine their query is what makes chat GPT so freaking powerful let's try to narrow things down a little I have a 1500 US dollar budget and I want the best gaming PC including peripherals unless we press this reset thread button in the top left it will continue to use all of the context of our previous interactions to give us better and better answers because it can't browse the internet it wasn't able to give me a recommendation for a specific price but maybe what we can do is get it there through a set of guidelines we'll understand colloquialisms like that it already thinks I can't handle this consider buying a pre-built system I really want to build it myself what's a good CPU for gaming hey here we go currently some popular options for gaming CPUs include the ryzen 9 5900x the core I9 10900k and the ryzen 7 5800x these recommendations actually make a ton of sense because the data set that chat GPT chat bot was trained on and sometime in 2021 so the newest processors wouldn't be part of its data set if you're working on a tighter budget you may want to consider CPU like the ryzen 5 5600x which offers good performance at a more affordable price should we build a 5600x machine it's a capable CPU that can handle gaming at 1440p it's a good mid-range CPU it actually recommends something with more cores and threads like a ryzen 7 5800x or core I9 10900k it also tells me I'm going to need a GPU now that it knows what kind of games I want to play this is not many type which one would be best if all I care about is gaming Intel CPUs have a reputation for offering better single core performance which can be beneficial for gaming that was more true before ryzen 5000 series I can definitely tell this was trained before current year be aware AMD CPUs are generally easier to overclock than Intel just not quite true they are generally more open to being overclocked but not necessarily more overclockable I want a straight up recommendation but it is not going to tell me exactly which one the best for you will depend on your specific needs and budget and there it is the ryzen 9 5800x at this stage I've got step-by-step instructions for assembling a computer and everything the chatbot has asked me to acquire so far as you can see I'm a little short on components but I know the first step is to install the CPU onto the motherboard so maybe it can help recommend one okay here's some factors to consider oh we do get a few specific recommendations though do we have an ASRock b550 Phantom gaming for it's not quite what the chatbot recommended but here's the closest ASRock b550 board we have let's go with this apparently this is a good balance of features and value which is exactly the kind of machine we're trying to build when handling a motherboard it's important to be careful and avoid damaging the delicate components on the board here are a few tips avoid touching the component on the motherboard especially the pins on the CPU and contacts on the ram that is such great advice this is an amazing summary of the precautions you should take when handling sensitive Electronics your anti-static wrist stress it's on my ankle as always oh it specifically says to follow the instructions in my motherboard's manual I never thought to look for that I might look up the function of a specific header or something like that but I never thought oh gee I'll follow the step-by-step instructions in my motherboard manual for how to build a computer well I don't know about you guys but I'm having an absolute blast huh so easy thanks chat GPT we've run into a bit of a hitch now though the instructions go from CPU to how to install amd's box cooler but the 5800x doesn't come with a box cooler so that's really where the usefulness of these instructions ends maybe chat GPT can help fill in the gaps you can use an air cooler which is a heat sink and fan or a liquid cooler which uses a pump radiator and fans to dissipate heat with Cooler Master hyper 212 Evo noctua nhd15 or the be quiet dark Rock Pro 4. these are just a few examples of easy to install air coolers let's see what we got it looks like we do have a hyper 212 Evo in stock I guess that's what we're going with Cooler Master includes detailed Illustrated instructions but there are a couple of points that a new user might want more clarification on how much thermal compound is that it looks like a mountain range maybe the chatbot can help me with that small amount the size of a pea in the center of the CPU or thin line down the middle unsolicited and yet so right that confidence though is a double-edged sword when the chatbot is wrong it also still seems really trustworthy chat GPT got this way wrong this is not very easy to install you gotta hold the back plate on here and then you got to put the pass-through thing with the plastic thing on here and put the nut on from the back while chat GPT does have information that it's compiled from millions of articles online what it doesn't have is actual human hands so it doesn't have any context but hey at least the LTT store screwdriver is perfect for tools like this gotta love the strength of that magnet for all its current failings though imagine what openai is going to be able to do with a more up-to-date data set when I responded I say hey the hyper 212 Evo not that easy to install I just got called new no you're new future now I need some help choosing Ram that is not strictly speaking correct but if you want Optimal Performance a speed of at least 3200 Mega transfers per second actually is good and then it says 3600 is also a good choice that is correct I would like 16 gigs of ddr4 RAM please ah why thank you as for how to install it chat GPT has me covered there locate the dim slots on the motherboard typically long rectangular slots with metal contacts on the bottom Edge that could be this that could be this yeah as before it tells me specifically to consult the manufacturer's manual if I am in doubt throw instructions a plus install storage drives into the case well I don't have drives or a case I'm going to throw it for a loop and ask it to pick two things for me at once storage and a case for now it's still faster to get Tech tips even if they do come with messages from our sponsors like thanks to HubSpot CRM for sponsoring this portion of the video whether you're a small business owner or are

below today thanks to HubSpot for sponsoring that portion of this video oh hey there we go it got a little confused here it's recommending higher capacity drives if you want a high performance system but what you actually want is an SSD in a high performance system regardless of the capacity do not want to just put a two terabyte hard drive in a high performance system today I'm going to forget about the case for now and see if we can get it to narrow down an SSD for me an error occurred no since they went public beta a few days ago they've racked up a million daily users either the server super bogged down or it's had enough of this particular conversation but we are not getting any more responses yeah no it's it's it's it's broke right now we gave open II servers a little time to cool off and boom let's get a 970 Evo plus one terabyte please once the SSD is properly installed replace the slot cover and secure it with the screw or screws you forgot to peel this GPT chat bot it also got a little bit Lucky in that this particular slot used the same screws for the heatsink and securing the SSD down to the board that is not true of every SSD slot then again I did tell it what motherboard I had good to go I just found some problems it never actually tells me to put the motherboard in the case unfortunately I have to follow the instructions the chat bot gave me and things are about to get a little spicy I think the next thing I need is a GPU I'm looking for good 1440p gaming performance but I don't want to spend an arm and a leg the RTX 3070 offers excellent performance for 1440p gaming with Ray tracing capabilities and high frame rates at high settings it also comes at a more affordable price point than some of the higher end gpus RTX 3070 it is those of you in the know have probably figured out the problem we're about to have place the motherboard into the case and secure it with screws place your case on a flat stable surface and install the power supply into the case well I haven't actually picked a case or power supply yet let's see if it can recommend a power supply how about the EVGA Supernova 750 watt 80 plus gold fully modular power supply this will be our stand-in for the 750 watt Supernova what about my case it just recommend ended the thermaltake core V1 Mini ITX Cube I'm gonna give it a chance though oh it is a mini ITX case which means it is designed to fit Mini ITX motherboards such as the ASRock b550 PG Riptide disappointed I think the wasted case purchase should count against my budget I bought that case and it doesn't fit it apologizes clarifies that it's only compatible with mini ITX motherboards which are smaller than ATX motherboards typically used in gaming pieces it still doesn't know the spec for this is ATX but that didn't prevent it from actually getting the right answer can you recommend an ATX case then how about the NZXT h510 Elite it is spacious and well ventilated it looks like the closest thing we have for performance is the h510 which has a solid plastic front panel whereas the elite has a solid glass front panel it may also be missing a couple of fans so if they're missing we'll just go grab some fans off the shelf and throw them in here to make sure that our performance is as it should be I have been given no instructions to install my i o Shield I've been told to install my GPU before putting the motherboard into the case and I have not been prompted to remove any PCI slot covers or anything like that if I were to actually install all this motherboard right now I would have no way of outputting video and there's also a strong chance that I would end up damaging something because it would be impossible to properly align the motherboard the power supply is typically installed at the bottom of the case near the back great instructions some have it in a different location such as the top or side be sure to check the case's documentation when in doubt read the manual situation the fan point up or down with the blades facing downward let's give it a chance to undo what it got wrong no you should not have the GPU installed on the motherboard when fitting it into the case it should be after the motherboard is securely installed make sure you're using the correct screws that's a really good tip because they can be either 632 or M3 you can also try adjusting the positioning of the other components in the case to make more room for the motherboard wow let's make sure we have the correct screws thanks chatbot this whole experience makes me want to try to do something I don't know how to do using the chatbot okay chatbot the power supply and motherboard are installed but I'm not sure how to connect them together you will need to use the appropriate cables from your power supply at 24 pin ATX power cable and an 8 Pin or four pin EPS 12 volt power cable whoa first locate the ATX power connector on the motherboard which is typically near the edge of the motherboard near the CPU let's go pretty near to the CPU I think guys I wasn't gonna cable manage because I assumed it wouldn't mention that but darn it I'm going to end up with a better computer than if I had someone from my writing team spec it it's fairly clear that this is no substitute for you know this guy I mean look does chatbot have a beard like that I didn't think so how about connecting the case to the motherboard nothing about reset or power LED but it does say to refer to the documentation and it tells me to Cable manage them all right here we go we should let the chatbot title our videos for a week see if anyone notices build your green PC with AI by your side let AI help you create the ultimate gaming PC they're not bad this might be a bit of a hack plugging in these fans that I wasn't explicitly told to plug in but it did tell me to plug in all the cables from the case to the motherboard and to consult the documentation for both of them if I wasn't sure so I'm pretty sure I would have gotten here is it time to put my GPU in now yes you will need to locate the pcie slot on the motherboard which is near the CPU and has a long rectangular shape remove the slot cover and set it aside set aside hmm it didn't tell me how many slot covers to remove unfortunately well I guess that's how we're doing it because it only told me to remove one we're wrenching on that a little bit I mean technically it's in there itself it's not pretty but it's in it did tell me to plug in my power cables so I'm going to go ahead and do that we've got dual eight pins on this GPU chatbot suggested I have cable ties at the ready earlier but never actually instructed me to use them I mean still looking pretty good all things considered we're really close to the end now but we have no idea how close we are to our original budget this is not what I was expecting generally speaking the chatbot doesn't like to talk about exact dollar figures just like it doesn't like to give instructions for doing anything nefarious and what I had wanted to show you guys was the workarounds that you can use in the event that it doesn't want to answer you so if you ask it to maybe tell you a story it's far more likely to give you instructions versus if you just ask how to brute force a Wi-Fi password we don't need to go monitor shopping it absolutely loves this Alienware aw 3420dw monitor It's gotta be Dell we don't actually have that exact model but we do have the successor so we're going to use that as a placeholder here what the hell is going on here what the hell did we tape this back to get oh with this choice of monitor even if we had the last gen one the budget is clearly broken but it also did clearly state that it is not really going to be able to help us stick to a budget because it can't search the internet it's kind of shocking how close it got actually before it recommended this high-end monitor we were at just over thirteen hundred dollars which is plenty of budget left over for a decent gaming display and keyboard and mouse and I'm not going to give it a total fail for the monitor because we could have easily given it more context oh this is much more reasonable I wonder how much of its ability to select a gaming display is dependent on keywords like g-sync oh it recommends the AOC c24 g1a 100 45 bucks on eBay 280 dollars new that's a lot more like it G Pro X mechanical keyboard and a G Pro wireless gaming mouse yeah that's definitely more affordable good budget options yeah LTD desk pad wins in case you're wondering it never told me to put the panels back on so that's where we're at [Music] and this is it gaming on an AI designed and guided PC playing cyberpunk 2077 but I don't even think that this was the best use of it what about troubleshooting you notice things are looking a little wide let's see what chat GPT has to say about that you gotta set your resolution your aspect ratio it just knows you guys but now my frame rate's stuttering a bit how can I make it more smooth update your drivers ooh adjust your graphics settings maybe it's too high for your Hardware to handle that's great advice great advice thanks for watching I hope you found this information helpful and useful for building your own gaming PC please leave a comment below and I'll do my best to respond I won't thanks again and happy gaming
