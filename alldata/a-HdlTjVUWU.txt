hello everyone and welcome we are sitting inside of the 2022 subaru wrx so checking out the new wrx there's three things i want to focus on for this video first of all i want to talk about the new engine i want to talk about how this car compares with the previous current generation wrx and i also want to get into you know whether or not this makes sense to upgrade to if you have the current gen wrx or if this makes sense to get into as a new car so starting off with the engine again we have the four-cylinder boxer engine uh that is tried-and-true with subaru it's now a bit larger in this wrx so going from two liters to 2.4 liters that's thanks to a larger bore meaning the cylinders are now wider the distance the pistons move back and forth is the same so the stroke is the same but the cylinders are wider so you get about 20 percent more displacement this is still using a twin scroll turbocharger but boost is now down actually so instead of 15.9 psi being peak boost for the two liter which was used in the current gen uh wrx now the new gen is going towards 12 psi of boost as the peak so the engine's about 20 larger but you're down about 25 on boost so what does this mean for torque and power so i'm going to put up on the screen uh the torque curve from 2000 rpm to 5200 rpm and that is at 258 pound-feet and then if we go to the new wrx the one we're in right now oh it's the same it's the exact same as the old one so if you extend this out then you will notice the difference between the previous engine and the current engine and that is at 5600 rpm you now have 271 horsepower instead of 268. so three more horsepower same torque very similar torque curve uh though with the larger engine you get a little bit more after and a little bit more before as far as the torque curve but peaks are very similar so to me that made me wonder you know why are we limited at this 258 pound feet and so i asked this to subaru um you know like is there something with the system the transmission the all-wheel drive system is there something limiting that torque from being higher because this engine is used in the ascent it's used in the outback and there are variations of course there's differences between the engines but very similar engine used in all of these vehicles and they have higher torque in the ascent and in the outback and so you know is there something limiting it here and that's not the case uh it really sounds like the reason why torque output is exactly the same as the previous generation wrx is that that's still better than the competition so it's kind of a bummer that you don't have more improvement here from a torque standpoint but when this car is targeting the civic si and the golf gti and it's still significantly ahead of them in power and torque then i guess you can kind of understand why subaru has decided to just kind of keep things level personally i wish that there would have been a little bit more improvement but we have switched over from the 2-liter to this 2.4 liter and so i asked them about that as well you know uh why this decision to go to it and their argument is that there's a better drivability to this 2.4 liter engine and i'm going to get into some of the advantages of it i think another worthwhile thing worth mentioning is that you know that liter turbo engine used in the wrx that turbo engine the turbo variant of it is used in nothing else so now that this engine is used you know it's used in the ascent it's used in the outback it's used in the wrx so it makes sense from a simplicity standpoint of you know all the engine variants we're going to offer to have it be something that already exists and is in other models so if power and torque are virtually the same are there any advantages to this larger engine and yes there are four advantages actually uh so the first one being you know when you're not in boost when you first put your foot down to the ground and you don't have that turbo charger spooled up yet when you're not in boost you're gonna have better power with a larger displacement engine so that's just a simple advantage uh second advantage being you're gonna get better response out of this uh because it is larger and it's running lower boost so if you think about two very different engine styles a large naturally aspirated engine and a small turbocharged engine and both of those engines are making the same power well the response that you get from those engines is going to be very different the large naturally aspirated engine is going to have really good response the small turbocharged engine is going to take time spool up that turbo charger and get that power down ultimately they have the same power but it takes you longer to get there with the turbo engine so you can think about a sliding scale between those two and with this we're moving closer to that larger naturally aspirated engine meaning our response is improving we're not as reliant on the turbo for the power because the engine is bigger so lower boost we're not waiting as long to get to these really high boost numbers and so you're getting that response quicker and subaru's shown the curves i mean these things are getting to peak torque sooner they've got a new electronic wastegate and electronic bypass control for the air intake side of this so it is an engine that gets to peak torque sooner and you get more torque sooner simply from the fact that this is a larger engine so better performance when you're not in boost better response and getting to that peak boost a third small advantage uh this one is only recommending 91 octane versus the previous generation wrx uh saying it required 91 octane so because you're running lower boost in this and the same compression ratio as the previous engine you're able to get away with using a lower quality gasoline as far as the octane rating but that said they certainly still recommend you want maximum performance you should go with 91 or above for the octane rating and then the fourth and final advantage i think of this engine is just the tuning possibilities right this engine already has more boost in it in other applications within the subaru lineup so you know it can handle it another thing this engine is used in the ascent for you know towing 5000 pounds you're not towing anything with this wrx so to me that says from a durability standpoint this thing's going to be in a better place than that 2-liter boxer engine the engine this is replacing for tuning for adding power to it you've got a larger engine to start with and you're starting at a lower boost so up that boost if you want to tune this thing and make more power i feel like you're at a better starting point to do so versus the previous generation wrx now moving on to the transmission so both of them have been updated you still have the option of a six-speed manual transmission which was what we are driving right now and then there's also what they're calling i believe the subaru performance transmission essentially it's their cvt but it's a new version of their cbt much improved it has better uh downshift rev matching if you're using the paddle shifters for the simulated gears these specific stepped ratios that it will choose within that cvt they're really proud of the improvements they've made to it so you know on the the previous generation wrx for me it's still really no question which one you want to choose you want to choose the manual it's lighter it's quicker it gets better fuel efficiency and it costs less and i believe that's still going to be the case across the board here i have not yet had the ability to try out the cvt but you are going to have advantages with the manual transmission and apparently the take rate on the manual transmission good for all of y'all who have done this and contributed towards it 85 i don't know of a car that offers a manual and an automatic and has a take rate that high on the manual so great that people are choosing it and i think you know there are a lot of advantages to it so i think that makes sense and good news with this new six-speed manual transmission first and second as well as six gear they're identical as far as the ratios and your final drive ratios are the same but they're giving you a more aggressive third gear fourth gear and fifth gear so you know keeping you within that power band as you get into those high rpms and you're shifting through the gears more aggressive third through fifth so i like to see that i feel like it's rare that you get offered more aggressive gearing as you get new models and subaru has done it so great to see that with the transmission now the transmission choice you make fundamentally changes this car i mean it's very different and not just because of the transmission but also because of the all-wheel drive system so with the manual transmission you have a viscous coupling center differential and so you have a nominal 50 50 torque split 50 to the front 50 to the rear if one of those axles starts to slip then you start to send more power to the axle that has the grip with the cvt you have a planetary style center differential which is using an electronically controlled hydraulic clutch to actuate and that has a nominal split of 45 of the torque to the front and 55 of the torque to the rear so a bit of a rear bias with the cvt give it a little lively uh feel to it and so either way you're always going to be driving both it's not like one of those systems where you have an on demand it's just driving the front axle and then when it needs it it sends it to the rear no matter what these are true all-wheel drive vehicles that are always driving all the wheels now as far as other mechanical differences versus the previous generation uh in the rear with the rear brakes they're slightly larger and they are now ventilated instead of being solid discs uh also the steering has been updated to a dual pinion steering system with the steering assist now off the axis so they take that steering assist and they put it directly on that rack rather than in the column you get better feel overall and you have a quicker steering ratio now so as far as the steering's concerned i don't know if i would say super communicative as far as the feel of it overall but from a responsiveness it does feel very quick and it's good i mean i don't have complaints here with the steering to me i enjoy it we were on some really twisty roads today and it's been just fine now this is a sports car so i know what everyone's wondering you're wondering hey what kind of fuel economy can i expect in this bad boy so the manual is actually doing worse than before which i don't find uh all that surprising considering the engine is now larger the cvt is actually doing better than before and if you were to compare the two the new manual is still better than the new cvt so the manual is the way to go if you want the best fuel economy and you want the quickest car and you want the lightest car and you want the most enjoyable car to drive so the manual is still the way to go in my opinion though i have not yet driven the new cvt you do get a slightly larger fuel tank now and something that i'm excited about is they've actually added ground clearance so instead of 4.9 inches like the previous generation we are now going to 5.4 inches so half an inch of ground clearance added and i like this i mean the 2014 sti had 5.9 this is still half an inch under that but this is talked about as this rally car and then when it doesn't have much ground clearance it's like you can barely get off any road and expect to to you know go over bumps and things like that so now that they've added a little bit of ground clearance i do like that about it and another very surprising thing that is very enjoyable about this car is that the weight is nearly identical to the previous generation and so you know this is a larger car overall you've got more space on the inside you've got more cargo space it's wider it's a little bit longer and yet the weight is nearly identical and again between the manual and the automatic you're looking at about 130 pound difference so you know that is a significant difference of weight savings if you do go with the manual versus the auto so what is this thing like to drive well i've talked a little bit about the steering uh the brakes i really like and i think subaru generally does a pretty good job with brakes as far as the pedal feel great nice linear feel as you get into it and the stopping power that's associated with how hard you're pressing i think the brakes feel super solid the throttle also i think is much improved over the previous generation one of the problems i had and i don't know if they fixed this in the later years of the wrx but one of the problems i had with the previous generation with a 2-liter engine is that if you gave it 50 throttle it would get to full boost eventually and this i've been messing with it and looking at this boost gauge here and you can see it actually holds back a little bit so you seem to have better control of torque delivery with this new car and that you can be more precise with your power delivery and where you put your foot on that pedal versus how much torque you're getting you know you give it halfway down and i'm not getting peak boost versus i then plan it and then i start to see that boost increase so the throttle control has improved over the previous generation you also have better uh from a rev hang standpoint you know it's not nearly like it was previously you get a quicker drop of those revs and so i love to see that from a manual drivability standpoint that's a nice big improvement okay let's talk suspension noise vibration harshness so this is something that i thought was going to feel different than it does this is an entirely new platform for the wrx so i mean this is a completely new car and you know the the body is uh much better optimized a much better design overall they've improved things uh pretty much across the board in this car and to me it still feels pretty stiff and i think part of that is they they kind of want to keep this characteristic of this sporty to drive uh raw feel to the wrx to me it's still a little raw maybe you like that maybe you don't but i would say it has a stiff suspension pretty stiff ride as far as noise in here i don't think it's too bad i think noise level is fine visibility is excellent which i like but as far as the stiffness of the ride i mean you're still going to feel the bumps in this thing and maybe some of the competitors are kind of trying to soften that suspension and tune a bit of that out um subaru wants you to feel things so you do feel it as you're going through the road from an interior standpoint it's a significant upgrade over the last gen you've got nicer seats they got rid of the all leather seats in favor of these micro suede seats which have better grip you know as you're going through corners it's going to keep you situated better they've got better bolsters now on the seats so i like the changes they've made you also have a nice large screen here with apple carplay so interior is a nice improvement over the last gen so now finally just getting into the question is it worth it so pricing hasn't been announced yet but i'm sure it's going to be competitive with the things it's going up against and when you look at this car it reminds me of when i bought my subaru wrx sti a 2014 hatchback and i waited for the 2015 to be announced and then once i heard about how you know few differences there were uh from the 14 to the 15 and they dropped the hatchback i was like all right i'm getting the hatchback i'm keeping the old gen rather than going to the new gen and you might look at this on paper and say okay you know it's it's not a a huge upgrade as far as versus the previous generation to this generation is it is it that big of a deal this is a completely different rework though i mean it's not like the 14 to 15 sti this is a much larger difference in vehicle from the you know 21 wrx to the 2022 wrx that said if i had the previous generation wrx i wouldn't feel like this was enough of a change for it to be worth it this is a better car in my opinion um but i don't i wouldn't say if i had the current generation wrx this would convince me to upgrade that said if you're if you're out of the market and you're looking you're maybe thinking between the two this is certainly the better vehicle they have improved the wrx um so it's good to see that i wish there had been a little bit more power but you know that comes with the territory of who they're competing against and if their competitors aren't raising their power all that much then you know subaru doesn't really have to do it either so unfortunate but i understand where they're coming from when they're looking at the si and they're looking at the gti and those are still you know in those low 200 numbers uh versus you know this is at 271. so you get good torque you get plenty of power you've got a great all-wheel drive system you can drive it in any weather uh it's a solid all-around sports sedan uh at an affordable price so for that you know kudos it's a cool car and i'm glad this thing does exist now the styling on the other hand i mean that's a subjective measure so i can't tell you whether or not it's good you have to just look at it and tell me whether or not you think it's good thank you all so much for watching if you have any questions or comments of course feel free to leave them below
