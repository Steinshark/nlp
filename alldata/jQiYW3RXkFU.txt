every language ever assembly a low-level programming language allowing wow we went this thing does not this is dead serious okay 15 minutes every single language every single language ever I cannot wait to hear about everybody's favorite language Synergy okay we got to start with assembly it makes sense me to give instructions to the computer's Hardware you see computers can only do things in terms of zero or one so assembly was created in order to make computer instructions more workable for human beings this works by using an assembler that translates the human readable code into ones and zeros assembly is one of the world's first pro almost a Kinesis keyboard it's almost a Kinesis keyboard back in the 60s this thing time traveled this thing has time traveled look at this look at this guy this guy was Pro this guy was raw dogging zeros and ones into a computer long before you did anything okay you and your JavaScript okay this is what this is what a senior Dev looks like this is what Jack Black in an alternative Universe looks like pramming languages it used to be the standard to run supercomputers back in the day but you still find it used currently to work with CPU memory and it's used sometimes in browsers via web assembly Fortran one of huh H uh web assembly and assembly are different just saying they're different the world's first highle languages the difference between a highle language and a lowle language was Fortran the world first highle language I thought um I thought algo alol alol alol uh when uh did alol I thought alol 69 okay and uh Fortran oh what about uh the Z the Z1 language that was like 1930 19 40 yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah is I thought the Z1 uh was considered like one of the most modern computers with with with with booing logic and stuff like that I thought that was like one of the I thought that was like the firstest firstest but okay okay Fortran did aren't you tired of being wrong no I never am tired of being wrong never be tired of being wrong okay I'm a programmer if if you're not ready to argue uselessly for hours over things that don't even matter then you're not ready to be a program you can manipulate the computer's memory much more directly it also executes much faster than a highle language the drawback is is that it's much harder to learn a highle language is much easier to understand and there's aot us Fortran was created by IBM in the 1950s the name stands for a formula translator programming in Fortran would be done by using a punch card then would be fed into a card reader and would be translated into code that the computer can understand this translating process is called compiling which basically changes the code that humans can read I can't tell tell you how many stories I heard in college from my professors about Punch Cards and they said the worst of all of the things that happen with Punch Cards is when you're walking to the machine and one of them told me a story about how they tripped and it was like 2550 Punch Cards some large amount tripped and just threw out all the punch cards just just let them fly had to redo your entire program from scratch cuz you tripped imagine just imagine that for a second quick sort this you filthy casual I know hand number every card skill issue you did have to like that was kind of the that was the the lesson is you handum the cards imagine not numbering them I know well you imagine numbering something imagine living that life where did quicksort come from let's see is that where quicksort came from that is where quick quicksort came from a dude that made quicksort and then was like wow I think I figured out a fast way to do sorting showed his boss and his boss is like you just invented the fastest sort ever ever and it was the fastest sort ever into the ones and zeros computers can understand com trans also known as commercial translator is another programming language what the hell did I just hear we're we're getting on the come train damn I did not I did not know that com train was one understand com train also known as  well anyways we're on to the com train let's go commercial translator is another programming language developed by IBM it served as the business equivalent to is come train is this like the precursor to cobal is this precursor is this cummer language for TR in which Fortran was used for scientific Computing it was influenced by another programming language called flomatic a programming language for data processing that ran on this giant supercomputer called the univac 1 lisp also known as list processing was created soon after Fortran it's known for using a lot of parentheses in its code it was an Innovative fair that is probably the most Fair statement ever for lisp is what is Lis known for a lot of parentheses I think today it would probably say that lisp is best known for the fact that it runs the world's greatest operating system emac but it's also fair to say it's just a lot of parenthesis language which inspired these Concepts in programming Cobalt standing for common business it was an Innovative language which inspired the tree data structures recursion I I feel like recursion had to be really you're telling me tree data structures weren't invented until lisp or recursion or higher functions or dynamic typing or conditionals or self-hosting compiler is that all true sus yes what what nope F boys yes what okay no one Concepts and programming cobal standing for common business oriented language was a programming language developed in 1959 Forest it businesses even though it was made so long ago it is still used today by institutions to process transactions The Code by the way it is wild that our financial system system runs on this language like we all just need to take a second and recognize the fact that our entire Financial stability is ran on cobal it's utterly wild it must be the most secure language ever it's because you have to write English you can't hack English it's too hard nobody can hack English Okay ain't nobody got time to hack English it's too hard to do looks like plain English sentences but this would later be translated onto a punch card one of the first adopters of the language was the US Department of Defense IBM RPG IBM report program you know for all fairness okay the American government is quick to innovate and then stops all forms of innovation and forever are frozen at a specific time I don't know what it is like the SEC uh part of its uh xbrl experience for uh after the um what's it called after the financial collapse and Enron screwing all the peoples xbrl was developed uh I forget exactly what it stands for but it was HTML 3.2 bleeding edge at that point and then they just never updated it ever again and now there's like this entire Arcane separate language called xbrl to file your 10 n or your 10ks and your 10 q's and all that crap for the financial system to prevent Enron from ever happening again I don't know it just exists generator is a programming language created by IBM meant to run on IBM systems it's one of the only programming language to makes use of r and columns for its code alal 60 short for algorithmic language 1960 is not a very well-known programming language but is one of the languages that inspired one of the most well-known programming languages in the world C it was also one of the first programming languages to use nested functions APL standing for nested functions what a good time it's such a good time until it's not a good time but it's a good time I just made one this morning and I feel pretty proud of it let's go APL uh a programming language you know if if anyone ever tells you naming is is not hard just remember that you had somebody who just finally gave up and was like it's just a programming language okay that's it a programming language first appeared in the 1960s is a programming language developed for mathematical equations mostly algebra it uses a lot of math and Greek symbols directly in the code simam I can't use the language that requires symbols okay that you imagine having to use that imagine actually having to use that like I mean I know I complain a lot about JavaScript JavaScript I love it but like just a m a skill issue you're a skill issue many decades ago that was one of the world's first objectoriented language object oriented programming is a way for programmers to use blocks of code that are is that jQuery is are we looking at jQuery right now oh gosh we are looking at so many J queries right now we are so J queried out why would you do a DOT count each and not pass in the element oh yeah that's because this is the element I forgot jQuery where's the indenting you son of a jQuery where's your indenting the indenting is just making me so angry right now I just I couldn't even read the code I couldn't even read the code what is jQuery you wouldn't understand okay you probably a react Andy you you don't get it you don't know it if you don't know jQuery you don't know usable and can interact with each other instead of pure functions and logic in object-oriented programming use blocks of code called objects by the way using jQuery as an example for object-oriented code is that was kind of wild I would have tossed out like simula as the example because that's the language we're currently covering or like Java 1.6 okay jQuery is not a great example this just not a great example of objectoriented code it's just objects are created by things called classes which contain properties and can use methods to explain it simply you can create a class called Pok√©mon name the object Charmander give it properties such as fire type and allow it to execute methods such as flamethrower and scratch speaking I'm super confused I thought Pokey man was a popular female streamer is she a furry now is that what happened can my broke boys tell me broke boys can you tell me about how good are the cookies tell me real talk who here bought the cookies I bet you one of you sons of bought a cookie press one in the chat if you actually bought a cookie come on let it out just it's okay no one No One's Gonna feel bad No One's Gonna feel bad if you bought a cookie let's go let's go we see some ones coming in let's go you know what I'm not offended At All by the way for anyone that bought one of her cookies let's go let's go you guys aren't broke boys but I did notice something that kind of hurt my feelings all the people who pressed one which was about seven none of you guys are subscribers to me I know you're not broke boys okay $5 a month you tell me you have countless hours of time easy a programming language that was mainly used by physicists in the 60s using aore in its code basic the beginner All Purpose that seems like a strange thing to be known for Speak Easy what oh by the way basic let's go instruction code was created at Dartmouth in 1963 it was created with the purpose of getting the average lay person to be able to learn how to code you see before that time programming had only been the domain of scientists and mathematicians okay first off that that this this entire math scene is not making any sense okay what are all these people doing on a whiteboard okay this doesn't make any sense there's a person right here which you can barely see there's a person in the background there's this guy and and this person is holding a pencil like this this scene doesn't make any sense who who brings a pencil to a chalkboard nobody brings a pencil to a chalkboard that time programming had only been the domain of scientists and mathematicians this was because of its easy to understand syntax syntax is basically the rules to writing in a programming language Ms Ms aka the Massachusetts General h Ms also known for how fun it is much like the disease Hospital utility multiprogramming system or sometimes just M for short was created to manage Hospital laboratory Information Systems that's right I've heard about this Ms I've heard about this I forgot who just told me this I want to say it was TJ but yes Ms the classic language for hospitals it was also used to manage electronic health records its code tends to be very tur which means you can take most of its word commands and abbreviate them into simple short letters logo and you know what you know what I mean me you can take most of commands and abbreviate I don't want to have to be typing all that in my life okay I just want to be able to just get things done dear goodness n s n t i k q s i quick set if kill K quit set if string K that's crazy hey thank you Mario I appreciate that you're going in a YouTube video thank you Mario I appreciate the 10 gifted Subs them into simple short letters logo an educational programming language made in 6s which makes use of what is known as a turtle graphic not an actual Turtle it's the name of the cursor used to draw geometric shapes as determined by the code Pascal a programming language that was very popular in the even being the default Engish for many computers back in the day was one of the first programming language to be used by an IDE which is an integrated development environment basically a dedicated program to write its code one of the most wellknown programs created with Pascal was Photoshop c a program really Photoshop wow okay hey whoa whoa hey I mean that's that's pretty impressive actually I didn't I didn't know that okay the more you know people the more you know wow okay okay in the 70s C is the greatest language of all time obviously the foundation of computer science is one of the most popular programming languages of all time created at Bell Labs it is the basis why is Bell Labs where all the good things came out of notice that IBM created all those stupid languages like RPG RPG nobody's ever even heard of it and then Bell Labs is they they came up with the Octo Thorp okay that's pretty useful um they came up with C they have a lot of things of many operating systems such as Windows and Linux it also o inspired many programming languages that came after it such as C++ C Objective C go Java JavaScript PHP Typhon and many more it's known for its lowlevel access to the computer's memory by using code called pointers computer memory was much more of a finite resourced in the past so programmers had to be much more careful about how they allocated it otherwise it'll cause problems such as memory leaks which is basically when this is a fact of life somehow we still memory leak in Javas rpt but that's not the point okay the point is is that you could also memory leak and not JavaScript it's just you know it's just a thing it's just a thing that would happen if you don't get it you don't get it I get it you know it's confusing okay um you know the days of limited Ram I don't miss them but at the same time you really had to think about things you know what I mean I wonder if we had a less of a ram appetite would we we have better software I don't know if that's true you know what I mean I think some people like I I think people like to imagine that it's true but I'm not sure if it's actually true like take the Nintendo 64 not a lot of memory right not not a ton and turoc rage Wars turo by the way the you could only get 49 out of 50 medals because there's just a bug and they ship the game anyways and I'm still hurt by it endo right I'm still hurt by it there's plenty of shitty software that existed in the 90s so I'm not sure if somehow that's a real problem when programs use up too much memory in your computer causing the computer to become painfully slow Small Talk a programming language in the 7s that was known for its object-oriented programming it inspired many objectoriented programming languages that came after prolog known as the first logic programming language it is known for being modeled after formal logic in philosophy ml also known as metal language pioneer statically typed functional programming which basically means giving information certain types such as strings integers Floats or booleans strings are just words and letters integers are whole numbers floats are real look at me shake my head okay hascal mentioned I understand I understand that hasell Haskell's granddaddy is over here I don't want to hear about the ml languages okay get them out of here shake up we're shaking off don't worry can we go back to can we get back to C please buan is something that can be either true or false SQL SQL also known as if he does not say squeal here I'm not going to be very happy structured query language also even called SQL is a language used for creating and managing databases you store information in things called tables and structure them with rows and columns the code also looks like plain English sentences it is used by many systems even today to store their data such as usernames and passwords transactions account by the way notice that he didn't even mention CSS the alternative to SQL like what what do how what are we supposed to do without CSS information and more basically think of it as a system of Excel spreadsheets C++ an extension of the C programming language the major difference is C++ has object oriented programming unlike the original C which didn't it's also known for its deep learning curve C++ is one of the most important programming languages of all time even still in wide use today still being the was that the Toby index of all time even still in I'm pretty sure we talked about this this is the Toby index don't listen to them but C++ should be pretty high up C++ is used everywhere I mean C++ is is is extremely important language and whether you hate it or love it it's still it's still very very popular Toby did get this one right okay Toby's a piece of but Toby got this right wide youth today still being the main programming language in creating operating systems web browsers databases and games Ada a programming language made in the 1980s that is mainly named after AA Loveless you know I always feel bad about Charles Babbage because like yo dog he also he he he like made the the analytical machine but ain't nobody giving him any credit right they're always just like oh I ate a love list and you're just like yo that's half the team dog why you got to always on babage what where's the love for babage but there's no love for a A or there's all the love for a but no love for BA babage it's it it ain't Fair it it ain't Fair bu the US Department of Defense it is named after the credited world's first programmer ad love mat Lab Mat lab or or Matrix library is a mathematics programming ain't no babage there I mean babage is like Intel makes a sweet piece of Machinery here aah does a little bit of programming on it and they're just like man A's so cool you're just like yo dog maybe they're both pretty awesome have you ever thought about that I'm still up Engineers matics based programming language that can be used for statistics Robotics and artificial it's still widely used today mainly by a I hate Objective C I wrote falor in Objective C it took me like four weeks I had the right to multithreaded it was the worst experience I've ever had the end language inspired by C that was created in the 1980s which became the main language for Apple Computers even being the main language for the early iPhones although its popularity has fallen over the years mainly due to Apple replacing it by a newer programming language called Swift in the mid2 t0s lab view made by national instruments in the 1980s it is a programming language that doesn't really use traditional code instead it's a graphical programming language where you build user interfaces ah scratch 1.0 okay okay we've seen scratch we've seen scratch using images erlang a programming language okay Ryan Winchester if you're in here please you're allow you're allowed to now spam Ryan Winchester you're now allowed to to do llang mentioned let's go beam got the beams designed for the Telecom language that was designed to work very well with text it's used for system administration network has been known as the duct tape that holds the internet together if you've ever seen the code it actually looks pretty wacky wolf created by Steven wolm it's a language that can perform data visualization image processing mathematics and pretty much anything you can think of it can even tell you the shortest route around Europe hll it's a functional it did a ukan circuit or whatever it's called is it a ukian circuit what's the name of the one where you start and end at the same place to go visit everything with the shortest path okay guys okay guys a uler circuit there you go uler circuit or Oiler uler Oiler circuit uh that's an NP complete problem an oian cycle hamiltonian cycle Yer y Yer Oiler is he Rich that's how you pronounced uler as Oiler uler uler is it a hamiltonian path I always forget which one it is anyways let's keep on going H mention let's go variables being immutable which means you can't change them the language is based on Lambda calculus visual there we go that's about all you need to know about uh hll okay that's called it's abstract you if you want to find any applications of hasle you're going to have to go look in a white paper database full basic a programming language developed by Microsoft in the early 90s it's used to create Microsoft programs and applications by using GIS or graphical user interfaces basically anything you can interact with with your mouse on the screen is part of the graphical user interface are you showing us an apple this is like old apple right here this is Macintosh Mac um yeah Visual Basic is is a curse and a plague upon the Earth it also has a very popular IDE of the same name Lua a language known let's go Lua for its speed and being able to be embedded into other programs it's also known for being very easy to learn Dela literally missed the most important part of Lua Brazil mentioned let's go let's go Brazil let's go Brazil let's go Brazil right like dude didn't didn't even mention the fact that it's Brazilian stands for Moon did you know it's Moon Lua Lua nothing much to say about it it's basically Pascal but with objectoriented programming it even comes with its own code editor oel oel is a functional based programming language like hasell and erling functional programming languages are good at doing maap and objectoriented programming languages are good for building Enterprise level software python python is a general oh damn did he just do what I think he just did did he just do what I think he just did chat's chat's malding we got we chat I've never seen chat bald this hard my entire lifetime what have you done you cannot possibly say that you're not wrong but you can't say that out loud you can people can get so upset purpose programming language and you can use it to make pretty much anything from desktop applications to websites creating bots or API handling servers and databases game development image processing statistics and so much more that it would need its own that's python for you python it does it it does it except for for Loops don't do for Loop don't do for Loops okay we use we use numpy for for Loops okay video python is currently one of the most popular programming languages for creating AI it's also one of the most popular programming languages in general in fact most beginner programmers start with python as their first programming language not only for its vast utility but also how easy it is to learn one of its only I think that that's probably changing a lot today I bet you the next generation of programmers those that are somewhere between nine to 13 their two languages are going to be scratch and Lua they're going to be making so many Roblox games like the reality is I think Lua is going to be one of the one of the largest uh one of the largest initial programming languages out there scratch is a great first language for kids right they get to understand kind of like the basic concepts setup loops and all that uh and then it goes from there waiting for Russ to be mentioned Russ will tends to be pretty slow compared to other programming languages like C++ Ruby Ruby is a language very similar to python even the code looks I think we renamed Ruby to dhh Lang didn't we ilar Ruby is easy to learn and the code is also very readable one of the most popular uses of Ruby is to combine it with a framework called on Rails to create websites adopting the full name Ruby on Rails Ruby on Rails is currently the backbones to many websites we know currently such as Hulu Airbnb coinbase he really came in hard with that Hulu Hulu I didn't realize Kickstarter hero I mean Heroku um GitHub yeah Airbnb coinbase damn don't even oh hey okay good dhh mentioned okay okay just Mak it sure just making sure we mention DH Shopify twitch SoundCloud and many more a lot of its popularity full stack websites full stack is the combination of the front end and the backend development of a website a website's front end is basically everything you can see with your eyes basically the entire interface the text the images the buttons and the videos are all part of the front end the back end is the non-visual part of the website which is mainly the servers and databases account information authentication and data storage is what's part of the back end Java remember the programs flip zoom in asked you to install on your computer yeah that's an actual programming language it gained popularity immediately after it's released and it's still popular today a big advantage that people forget and if for those that have frequent my channel don't forget but a lot of people do forget that Java and JavaScript made a co- announcement you guys remember that the release of java and the release of Java's web whatever and the release of JavaScript all together allows you to create prrams that are very platform independent that's because Java can be compiled into B code which can be understood by many operating systems all your computer yep right once to bug everywhere to do this which is what you're installing every time a computer asks you to install Java Java can be used to create many things like video games such as Minecraft or mobile apps on Android a meme amongst beginner programmers is that Java's code tends to be preos are a programming I don't think that's a meme I think that's just reality isn't that just I mean that's that's just fact of life no one's alleging that Java's verbose it is verose there's no alleged there's no allegedly so here okay this is not a memory or this memory this is not a courtroom okay language in which it's all right let's go main purpose is statistics it's a widely popular programming language used to organize data and data visualization it's very useful for researchers conducting epidemiological widely is a unique term I do not believe it's widely studies if you're a researcher studying in fields such as economics psychology biology medicine Etc learning how to code in either python or R is a very useful skill JavaScript JavaScript I love it is not the same as Java in fact it has uh yeah it is they both have null the same thing nothing to do with Java JavaScript is a that's actually not true uh the null was included in Java JavaScript specifically to interrupt with Java in fact JavaScript had requirements due to I'm just saying it's it's to say it's not it's they're nothing alike is is a little bit of a lie okay it's a little bit of a lie just saying a programming language that is mainly only used in web browsers in fact 98% of the can I rewind that for a quick second Java in fact it has nothing to do with Java JavaScript is a programming language that is mainly only used in web browsers someone's going to be upset when they hear about node in fact 98% of the internet uses JavaScript JavaScript is responsible for the main functional aspect of the website it's based on the ecma Strip standard and is often used in conjunction with HT remember when Microsoft held down the EC script standard for like a decade because they wanted a competitive Advantage remember Microsoft how they how they've done Shady business dealings with everything they've ever touched ever and now you guys just let them run for free on your system in a program called vs cout HTML and CSS but sometimes you can create websites with just pure JavaScript using Frameworks such as react and with react mobile you can create mobile apps HTML and CSS HTML and CSS are both scripting languages to create websites HTML he did it again H HTML is a program language okay it it has always been a programming language and if you guys aren't willing to accept that I I I think you're just I I think you're ignorant okay okay it's 2024 it's time to ex that's a tweet that is such a tweet it's such a tweet it's such a tweet it's 2024 it's time uh it's time you accept HTML as a programming language boom and tweet that one all right let's go back to this video all right we're back in deals with the pure content and structure of the website it uses code called HTML tags in order to build the content on the web page CSS is used for the design or aesthetic look of the website do you love how we used uh un unordered lists to put in ordered items isn't that just like the greatest thing ever with HTML that that just unordered list are the list of order items it just makes me so happy it deals with the arrangement of content colors borders gradients opacities and can even perform animation makes me happy PHP AKA person no no no no one uses ordered list okay that's that's ridiculous okay no one uses an O we all use U's homepage but sometimes also it is ordered unorderly unordered list everybody called hypertext pre-processor it's a programming language mainly used on web servers you can actually embed directly into HTML although waning in popularity is still the backbone of many major websites today PHP is a great language and as I mentioned earlier and I'm going to mention again okay okay I'm gonna mention this again you know why because we are yeah I'm giving a 15minute talk at La apparently my computer is just not loading things anymore uh luron 15 minutes this guy right here okay we're definitely going to have to do an intro video where they're going to drive me in they're going to drive me in in a Lambo me and Taylor me and Tay me and Tay swiftly will drive in ah very excited about the whole situation it was the language Mark zuger bird first built Facebook in action script a language based on JavaScript who didn't do a little bit of action script there's a there was a there was a thing for a while called Ratatouille I believe was its name or something along those lines uh and it was a uh the ability to run action script in the browser by compiling it to JavaScript and having an entire uh ecosystem around it this was like in 2011 I believe it died but nonetheless it was real and Flash have you ever played a flash game back in the day that was most likely made using action scripted by macr media which released action script 1 and version 2.0 but when macr media was later bought out by Adobe Adobe released action script 3.0 even though as of 2020 Adobe Flash has died out you can still use action script with Adobe animate C everybody loves like I have never met somebody that hated uh action script it seems like action script was was actually really good was really good language I kind of feel sad that I didn't know about action script yeah I'm pausing it I'm pausing it on C I'm pausing it on C uh just because I know it's obviously the the greatest language in this list language made in the early 2000s by Microsoft it was influenced by C++ in Java C's most common uses are being used in web servers with the Net Framework and video game let's go mentioned I IIs mentioned wait yeah I let's go let's go the greatest web server of all time known for its ease of use and its friendly developer Outlook game development with the unity engine Scala Scala was made as an alternative to J that's the end of C everybody unity and IIs um yeah that seems about right they didn't even mention xnaa it's revolutionary counterpart for developing video games for the Xbox and zoom handheld which came in everybody's favorite color such as brown Java it also uses many of Java's same technology such as the Java virtual machine but unlike Java it has many features of functional programming power windows command line on steroids come also people love Powershell everyone says that Powershell really is super awesome is that true production level read the manual with its own scripting language f f is the sister language to C with the difference of it being able to support functional programming je I thought F was like o camel I thought F was Microsoft o camel I I thought F was literally what Java is to C as o camel is to FIA a programming language made in the early in order to perations data analysis and visualization main advantage is that it's much anyone that does jul the code is a lot easier to read and it's much easier to learn El a programming language designed to create graphical user interfaces for websites it can be compiled in I heard Elm is awesome and I believe charm uses an Elm like pattern right to be able to do uh its interfacing and I'm going to be doing some uh some charm here shortly on on stream I'm going to be doing a bunch of charm on on stream and I know I'll be doing a lot of elm like patterns every time I've Ed it it's pretty cool it's pretty cool stuff you hate it Elm yeah that's [Music] Charming shut up I'll be doing an SSH client for Vim APM JavaScript Nim a programming language with Nim mentioned n dude I swear people that love Nim absolute brain disorder absolutely very like love it just just just absolutely problems going on upstairs it's crazy it's crazy of python combined with the memory allocation of C++ Raku nothing much to say a language for Gremlins is what you should say because that was one of its most famous articles Raku a language for gemman Raku a language for Gremlins which you can like redefine anything literally it's a language for Gremlins okay I didn't I I'm not just making these things up it's just this is this is life this is the life you need to live is to learn it's basically Pearl but version six although it has a pretty wacky logo scratch a programming language made in MIT that is completely Visual and block based no seriously the code F together like Lego blocks it was made with the purpose for teaching children how to code despite it you can make pretty complex things with It Go formerly known as go let's go C 2.0 C 2.0 let's go I like go was created at Google to be a modern version of C the code can be similar to python but it's much faster greatest part about go no colored functions let's go with compiling method it's mainly used in service with framework worst part about go it's not as complex as rust best part about about go it's not as complex as rust think about it like Docker holy C A programming language created by Terry a Davis in 2005 made with assembly it was used to create an operating system called Temple OS an operating system inspired by a revelation from God the main interest in this programming language is due to the backstory of the developer although being a talented programmer suffered from and ultimately succumbed from his battle with schizophrenia cotlin known as the RP Terry I'm glad that after that sag moment talking about Terry we are now going to go to the only programming language which also doubles as a D's Nuts joke rip Terry and cotland D nuts let's go easier form of java is a language used to create mobile apps on Android OS the most popular IDE to code cotlin in is Android Studio typescript basically JavaScript but with static typing Dart a programming link no no it's JavaScript with a linter language created by Google that you can use to create web applications or mobile apps using the flutter framework Swift develop flutter these nuts also works really well by Apple to replace Objective C it is the standard PR language to create anything in iOS and it comes with its own code editor called X I wish Apple wasn't such a dick and would just make Swift usable on not stupid ass xcode like I think xcode should just be there and not so much of a requirement I just want to like I would program a lot more Swift I think if if it wasn't so geared towards working in this one one Walled Garden Swift looks like a cool language you can only code in Swift if you have an Apple computer or use a virtual machine rust okay this is the let it out everybody let it out let it out everybody come on let it out Russ mentioned let's go let's go let's go Russ mentioned I know bu rust brust is a great language True Modern version of CN C++ it's it is not a modern version of CR or C++ good if you want to write simple code while also handling memory issues it's a very popular programming language and it's used to make applications where performance is extremely important such as game engines or operating systems solidity a programming language created for the E networ programs created in solidity are called smart contracts these Smart Tracks are later deployed to the blockchain however once smart contracts are deployed to the blockchain they cannot be changed or altered again so before a contract is deployed that's why you got to use the diamond pattern usually developers test them thoroughly beforehand this is done using you just say developers trust that to test them thoroughly come [Music] on come on we're all developers here okay you know you know you know we ain't testing with truffle or hard hat okay testing environments such as truffle and hard hat depending on the smart contract can cost memory and even money in main uses are for creating decentralized app I like the fact that they did a solidity programming app and then he put salana which uses rust right doesn't salana use rust isn't it kind of funny kind of funny I don't know kind of funny kind of funny decentralized Finance applications or defi to even your own tokens or nfts the type of smart contract you'll make will depend on the ERC format you're adhering to ERC standing for ethereum request for comment Elixir a popular I was going to make another comment but we're on to Elixir okay Brazil mentioned again we got two brazils let's go let's go Alexa Brazil mentioned Jose let's go Jose oh my goodness so good yes I'm glad I see Ryan Winchester already got a comment deleted what did he say Elixir Elixir Elixir Elixir yeah delete that  get him clean out of here good that was created in Brazil it runs on the erlang beam virtual machine erlang mentioned let's go Earl earling earling earling earling Earl Earl Earl yeah can't delete that one can you you can do with Elixir the same things you can do with earling the language is commonly used for Telecom e-commerce and finance Zig is that true Ryan Winchester I didn't realize it was used for Telecom you've been telling me it's been used for for servers this whole time I feel like to by the way we're in Zig let's go Andrew Kelly let's go King language intended to be the success zigg is the true C C++ successor I'm saying it there you go I said I said it zigg is the truest successor to C there has I think ever been you said go was go is C 2.0 it's a difference okay it's a difference Go's electric Baloo of C okay there's a big difference between being the the electric Baloo where Zig is is just C just nicer it's it's it's like everything you've ever wanted in a c like thing tweet it or fake take tweet it or fake take boom I'll say I'll say I'll say that you think you think you dude you realize my my editor who's editing this video just laid down the most offensive tweet to date and you're saying that we're worried about saying that zigg is modern C zigg is better at modern C then C++ or rust boom tweet that Zig should honestly I think Zig should have been the one that went into Linux more than um rust yeah I also just said that out loud false I'm just saying it's it's it's it's really it's it's an incredible language of C it was created in the mid-20s and is slowly gaining in popularity Microsoft Power FX a language created in 2021 wait you didn't end on Zig you ended on Microsoft Power FX what the hell are you doing by Microsoft it is used in a low code program called Power app a low code program is a program that allows you to create applications with little to no code but if you want to add extra logic or functionality to your app it would be power effects also the language is based on Microsoft Excel be sure to share this video and thanks for I thought Excel was Visual Basic of some sort okay holy cow um that video had a lot of stuff in it uh I actually like that video you know what I liked the video I'm going to subscribe I thought it was a good job like went over so many great languages in there a lot I didn't know about lot some that I did know about I mean how else do you you do that many programming languages in 15 minutes that was absolutely fantastic huge fan of Zig though I loved Zig I love I love Zig I I want to do more Zig but I unfortunately also want to be able to program things to completion so I'm just choosing go you know what I mean I'm tired of do I'm tired of rust I think I've done enough rust I've done two years straight of rust for all my side projects and all my little tools I built at Netflix and all that kind of stuff it's time for something different I'm going to try out go for a year and really give it a more solid attempt as opposed to doing it for a week completing what I was trying to build and then never using it again because I'd rather go struggle with something else you know what I mean I'm G to actually I'm actually going to do more things and go hey the name is the go aen okay
