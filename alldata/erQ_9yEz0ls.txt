- This is the most expensive
firework in the entire world. And it cost me over $160,000. And I also bought a $5,000
firework, a $10,000 one, and this big behemoth right
here is a $40,000 firework. And everything here, we spent
over $600,000 on this video and every single firework
will be launched. Starting with this one, it costs $1. Chandler, go launch it.
- Gimme this. It's lighting. (firework buzzes) That was kind of lame. - Here's a $10 firework. Let's see if it's better. - Gimme that. (firework shrieks) - Chandler got so scared. Here's a $50 firework. We're gonna go up to 200 grand. Go.
- It's on fire, but it's nuts. I don't like it! Run! (firework pops) - I can't wait till you
see the $200,000 firework. I don't know why I'm holding up a seven. - That was a little
step up from last time. I like it. - Chris just had a baby. As you see here, it's really adorable. Good for him. Hence, why he's not here today. Here's the $375 firework. You're Chris for the day, go light it. - Someone give me a lighter. - This is $375. I'm so afraid. - Oh, it's so much. Oh, oh, oh, oh! - [Jimmy] It's so colorful. - Oh wow, this is spectacular. How is it gonna get better than that? - I got $1,000 firework
with your name on it. - My name.
- Let's go get it. $1,000. - Where's my name? - Bada bang, ka-chow! Those nine boxes combined equal $1,000. - [Karl] Go.
- [Tyler] Oh, shoot - We're gonna die. (rock music)
(fireworks pop) (Karl screams) - Oh my goodness. - The drone survived. This next firework is the most epic thing you have ever seen. This mortar will leave this tube at 500 feet per second. - Speed, baby. - It weighs 160 pounds,
which is more than Karl. - But I'm brighter. - We even had to get FAA
clearance to light this. There can't be planes in the sky. - All right, buddy, go boom for us. - We're gonna light it, but you guys have to go 500 feet away. So step one is you hit the power on and then I was told to turn this key. Okay, now it's beeping. There's a lot of buttons, but they told me this
is the one that matters. Chandler, give me a countdown. - [Chandler] Three.
- [Jimmy] Fire! (fireworks explode)
(upbeat music) - Oh!
- Oh my God. - Whoa! - That looks like a nuke. - Yo, that was insane. - This is Manny and Manny wants to fly. So we strap 100 rockets to him. - We needed it to get in the air. We decided we had to dress it pretty fly, you know what I'm saying? We had to get it up there. - Shopmrbeast.com. - Buy it. - I got the Cobra boys. Chandler, I'm gonna let you do it. - Three, two-
- One! - [All] Oh! Oh! (fireworks explode) - [Tyler] Oh my God! Oh my God! - [Karl] Oh my God! - [Tyler] Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! - What did we put in there? - Why did the fireworks blow up? Why didn't we just have fireworks that just went up? - [Tyler] Bro, they like went over like- - [Chandler] Us.
- [Jimmy] Dude, it looked like aliens were attacking. - Wait a second, where's Manny? (guys laugh) Manny, are you-
- [Tyler] He's right here! - No! - [Jimmy] Where's his head? - No! (sad music) - I've always wanted to launch a bunch of fireworks in a car. What does it do? Does it ricochet? Does the car blow up? Who knows? Three!
- [Jimmy And Karl] Two! One!
- Three. Oh!
- We have the shot. (rock music) - [Jimmy] I think it's ricocheting. - [Chandler] It is. - That's terrifying. - Wait the roof blew.
- [Karl] What? - [Chandler] They're shooting far. - Whoa! Oh, shoot. - [Karl] It's on fire. - Oh, it is.
- [Karl] Yo, there's a fire. There's a fire straight up. - [Jimmy] Yeah, it's on fire. - We wanna blow stuff up. So that's what we're gonna do. - The whole trunk is full of fireworks. We're gonna add these. We're gonna light this one and it's gonna go boom. - Light me. - Your lit. Go! (fireworks explode) - Look at the fire. That's as ferocious as it's gotten. Bro, it just, go. Yo, the fire is engulfing it. Look at it. - Oh! Oh!
- Run. (rock music) - Yo! Hey! Now that's what we're looking
for right there. Yeah! (guys applaud)
- We did it. - In the past I microwaved a microwave. And after that I microwaved a microwave microwaving a microwave. Then I grilled a microwave, microwaving a microwave, microwaving a toaster, toasting an iPhone watch,
microwaving a microwave. I have a lot of experience
with microwaves. And tonight we're microwaving a firework. (door slams) Oh shoot! - Alright, let's see what happens. - [Chandler] How long is it cooking for? - I did it for a minute. I was told we only needed a minute. - [Chandler] It's gonna be so loud. - But this is supposed to explode like 1,000 feet in the air. - Oh, is it? - Guys, we got bulletproof
glass, we're fine. - Four seconds left. - I thought it was gonna- (microwave explodes) - [All] Oh!
(Karl screams) - [Karl] That was awesome! - For this next scene, we have hundreds of drones here and we're gonna do something very cool. Just watch. Hundreds of drones are
currently flying up in the sky and they're about to disappear. - [Karl] What?
- Just you guys wait, I have something really cool planned. Here's how it works, whatever you say in this walkie talkie the drones will spell. Burger. - No way. - [Jimmy] Watch. What does that say?
- Oh my God. - Chandler, what does that say? - Oh my God!
- Burger. - Those hundreds of drones currently spell burger in the sky. You could see that a mile away. What do you want the drone to spell? - Cheese balls, cheese balls. - [Tyler] Oh my God.
- [Karl] Brah! - Come over here.
- Oh. - This next one, I let Chris pre-pick it. I don't even know what it is. Oh, of course he did the gotcha symbol. - I love my mom. - Okay, I'm gonna override it. Karl's dumb. He's gonna get so mad. - Brah, what! - Whoops, I guess the drones are broken. - [Karl] My name's Karl
with a K. Stop doing this. - You thought in this video
we just have epic fireworks. No, we have tons of cool stuff. We're just getting started. What's a 4th of July
show without sparklers? - It's a bad 4th of
July without sparklers. - I agree. These are normal sparklers
that you could buy, but their lame, so activate the project. Bazinga!
- Bazinga! (fireworks pop)
Oh my gosh! - We bought 520 sparklers
and drew our logo. - [Tyler] Woo!
- Karl, yo, is this fake man. - There's nothing fake about it. I'm an expert. Like, they don't make t-shirts that lie. Let me show you around,
I'm the expert, alright? So what's gonna happen is it's gonna explode-
- Bang! - Why did that get me? - See how I didn't move at all. - Now, we're gonna launch 150
fireworks at the same time. We had a lot sitting on the table so we're just gonna do 'em all at once. - We're about see 150 explosions. - Let's do it.
- Right now. - We're back in command center. - I'm pumped, dude. This is about to be sick. - Three, three, three. (fireworks explode) - Wild! - I'm really excited for
the $40,000 firework. It's gonna be that, but 40 times better. - That's just math. - It's officially time for the big boy fireworks to come out. A $10,000 firework show. Give me a countdown and I'll launch it. - Two!
- I don't care. I'm launching. Fire! - Whoa! - [All] Oh!
- I farted. - [Jimmy] This isn't just one firework. This is an entire show. - They're like little popcorns. - A little bit bigger than popcorn. - [All] Oh!
- [Karl] My god! Oh my god!
(guys clap) - Whoo! (fireworks continue to explode) - Did you guys enjoy that show? - It was loud.
- It was good. My voice cracked. - It was good. - I think we could all agree
the 10 K show was cool. - It was wild. - But it was a little long. That entire five minute
show that you just watched, they're all gonna launch
at the same time now. Tyler, when you press fire, you are gonna launch 4,000 shells at the exact same time. - This is too much power.
- I am terrified. - [All] Three, two, one.
- [Tyler] Fire! (fireworks explode) - Oh, wow! (fireworks crackle) - That was the coolest thing I've ever seen in my entire life. Dude, that was dope. - Guys, that was dope. - I'm not gonna lie. - That was dope.
- That was dope. - [Tyler] I pushed the button, I mean. - Things are about to get crazy. This is a $40,000 firework. I could have bought a car. I coulda put a down payment on a house. I coulda give Chandler 40 grand. Or I coulda bought 10,000 copies of Shrek, but I did none of that and I bought a $40,000 firework. This $40,000 firework is literally gonna blow your socks off. - No pun intended. - It is over 9,000 shells. That $10,000 firework was 4,000 shells. This is going to be four times bigger. $40,000 is a lot of money. There's a lot of stuff
we could do with this. - Three, two, one-
- [All] Fire! (device beeps) (fireworks explodes) - [Karl] Oh my god! - I'm terrified. I thought I was gonna die. - That was crazy!
- That was the best thing. - I can't hear. - How are we not arrested? I literally had to back
up it was so bright. - I know. Now that we did that, was that worth a Tesla model three? - Yes.
- Speak for yourself! What's he talking about? - That was $10,000, a
second of flashing light. But that's $40,000. Imagine $160,000. - It doesn't get better than that. We just peaked. - We'll see. - Bro, are you kidding me? Look at this one. I can fit inside that. Do you think I could
fit my head in this one? I wouldn't tell you to
put your head in it. - Why not?
- It's a safety precaution. - It's not even on. - Ready to see the
world's largest firework and light up the sky! - It's supposed to be freaking nuts. - We are about to launch
the largest firework anyone in mankind's history has ever seen. Literally, a world record. $160,000, 4,000 pounds, 15 feet deep holes, we literally needed a forklift. First things first, you have
to turn the control panel on. - Oof. - You then turn the key.
(device beeps) - Oh my gosh! - Let's all press it together. - I'm shaking. - Five- - [All] Four, three, two- - Skip number one!
(device beeps) (fireworks explode) - Yo, you can hear that over- - [Tyler] I felt it in my chest. - [Jimmy] Oh, up there.
- [Karl] Oh my god! (fireworks pop)
(dramatic music) - That is so bright. - It's literally raining
fire for like a mile. It's so scary. - It may not look like that, but that's literally like a mile. What were your thoughts, Chandler? - On the second boom, I heard like this whoosh. - All around us. - Literally.
- I felt it in my chest and we're 2,000 feet away.
- I can still feel it. - Anyone else still just
shaking a little bit from that shockwave? - It like realigned my heart. - I know. I still feel it in my chest. Was that better or worse
than you thought it would be? - That was spectacular. - The $10,000 one was a little better. - And that, boys, was the biggest firework in the history of mankind. Hit the subscribe button. Goodbye. - Hit it now!
