are you paralyzed with fear that's a good sign fear is good like self-doubt fear is an indicator fear tells us what we have to do remember our rule of thumb the more scared we are of a worker calling the more sure we can be that we have to do it that's some good advice [Music] during the course of my career as a documentary dp i've been to dozens of countries i've lived away from home for more than 15 years i've interviewed cartel hitman i've seen more death and suffering than i'd like to remember and i've even been shot at myself i think i've done a lot of things that people would find scary and if i'm being honest those things scared me too even now after working internationally for most of my adult life i'm still nervous when i head to the airport with my bags packed but the reason things worked out is because i managed to push through even though i was scared so why after all of that am i scared of youtube before i get into that you're probably wondering who i am and why you should care about anything i have to say that's a fair question i'm a documentary dp or cinematographer and a former photojournalist over the course of my career i've gotten to work on tons of big-budget docs for people like netflix nat geo showtime vice the new york times lots of names that you've probably heard of so [Music] for a lot of my career i specialized in telling stories that were either dangerous or took place in very remote areas and unfortunately in 2019 i pushed my luck a little far and almost died i decided it was time for a change so i moved home to canada just in time for the whole world to shut down due to covet 19. weirdly even though i work on big name documentaries i found myself watching less and less of that stuff in my free time and spending a lot more time watching youtube it's a little strange i'll admit that i spend so much time working on these huge productions but then when i come back i don't feel like watching them that's just the way it is for a while i felt really guilty about that like if i wanted to be a real professional i needed to come home and study what else was out there but honestly i think i just burned myself out on docks and i couldn't handle any more serious subject matter when i was off the clock whatever the reason is i really like youtube and i have for a long time i've watched it evolve over the years from something that was kind of cheap and disposable to something where a lot of really talented people are sharing great advice and it's become a platform for education i've learned so much from youtube that i really wanted to join the conversation and actually start contributing instead of just watching but the problem was it scared the hell out of me [Music] it might be hard to believe that someone who's made a career out of working in dangerous areas could be scared of uploading videos to youtube from the comfort of my own office but in a bunch of ways making youtube videos is a lot scarier than being on a big budget production for starters being in front of the camera is really difficult i spent years developing the skills to be good behind the camera and i was amazed at how hard it is to to be natural and come off as myself when the cameras pointed at me as soon as i tried to make a single video and realized how insanely awkward it is i have a newfound respect for all those guys out there who are doing it every day and making it look easy it's really hard youtube also requires you to put yourself out there in a really vulnerable way when i work on big budget docs there are dozens of people involved from the production managers and accountants in the office to the executive producers and writers who never set foot in the field and all the way to the sound guys camera assistants fixers drivers and all the people who actually make the production happen it's a team effort everyone has their specific job to do and usually they're pretty good at it if the production goes well it's because everyone did their jobs well if it goes badly it's because everyone messed up it's not all resting on your shoulders like it is with youtube right now it's just me and the camera and if this video sucks it's my fault no one else's on a big budget dock if the project doesn't work i could easily just say like the director doesn't know what they're doing or the editor wasn't very good and people would believe it i can kind of distance myself from the final result but with youtube there's nowhere to hide i can't blame anyone but myself for the success or failure of these videos the other challenge is my eco youtube occupies a really weird space in the film world where it can really easily be seen as a lesser art form [Music] i spent a long time developing my skills to the point where i could get hired by the big names in documentary and making youtube videos can often feel like like a step down in credibility i'd be lying if i said it didn't feel good to get hired by those big name brands it feels really validating that's just my ego talking documentaries are about telling stories and there's no reason that i can see that you can't do that just as well on youtube as you can on netflix i mean obviously there's some budgetary differences but a good story is a good story when my ego tells me that youtube is a lesser art form and that i should stick with the big name people that's really just another way of saying i'm scared i'm scared that those big name clients will see these videos and not want to hire me anymore or that all my colleagues in the industry will start laughing behind my back and think that i lost it but all those things are just fear so what changed well for starters the pandemic i used to work all the time it was so bad that at one point i was only home for 12 days in a three-month period then coven 19 hit all the airports closed and all my jobs were cancelled that forced me to take some time to really think about what i wanted out of my career and for my future as a filmmaker most importantly i realized that my career was being controlled by other people i needed production companies to green light projects raise money and hire me before i could start working i needed other people's permission before i could do what i love to do i also realized that the world has to be running smoothly in order for me to do my job i never thought there'd be a time when i couldn't just jump on a plane and rush off to shoot a job in any place on earth but we know differently now all these things combined to make me understand that there were a lot of gatekeepers between me and doing what i wanted to do now look i'm not here to dramatically announce that i'm walking away from the documentary industry and that i'm only making youtube videos from here on out that's not what's happening i love my job and i plan to keep doing it for as long as i can but i also want a creative outlet that doesn't require someone else's permission i want something that's pandemic-proof and totally in my control and so here we are i want this channel to be the resource that i always wished existed when i was starting out in the industry it can be really hard to find mentors and people to give you solid advice on how to move forward and i hope that i can make that just a little bit easier for you i don't mean technical reviews on all the latest cameras and lenses because there are people out there who can do that way better than me just go watch gerald undone or philip bloom or someone like that if you want that kind of information i'm talking about skills strategies and practical advice for how you can start your career as a filmmaker professional filmmaker we can talk about things like how to work internationally how to stay motivated how to develop your own films and how to overcome those mental roadblocks that seem to be telling you that you can't make it so i'm still scared of youtube i'm terrified anyone who tells you that this is easy is a liar it is not but i'm gonna do it anyways because all that fear is is a sign that i'm doing the right thing so comment down below and let me know what scares you most about starting your youtube channel or launching your career as a filmmaker this channel is going to grow and evolve as i figure out how to be the most useful there's going to be a new video every wednesday and the more i know what you want the better it's going to get whatever happens it's definitely going to be an adventure and i can't wait to bring you all with me see you you
