- Hello, friends. I'm leaving now to go deep
into the Amazon jungle with my friend, the
incredible Paul Rosolie, deep to parts of the rainforest that very few humans have ever seen. I will try my best not
to get eaten by anything. The purpose of this trip
is to celebrate nature at its purest and most intense, and to celebrate the
work of people like Paul, who have dedicated their life
to protecting the jungle, and the endless diversity
of life that call it home. If you want to support Paul in his work, please donate or reach
out to Jungle Keepers. See the link in the description. I hope to get back in one piece and have some stories to tell, and I will also try to
record a podcast with Paul when we're deep in the jungle. I'll be offline until I emerge out. Meanwhile, no internet, no phone, no connection to the outside world, just the raw, beautiful
immensity of nature. I am truly grateful to be
alive, to have gotten the chance to live on this beautiful planet of ours with all of you, my fellow humans. I love you all.
