ladies and gentlemen today I witnessed one of the most insane chess games that I've ever seen in my life and that is saying a lot because here on YouTube I have a playlist dedicated to completely absurd chess games sent in by you and this game sent in today is by a 900 rated subscriber there's still a tremendous amount to actually learn from this game because there were some very key and instructive moments but the ending of this game was like a movie and I'm going to narrate it to of you you're going to learn something but you might laugh so hard you pee your pants and I am not responsible for any damaged clothing today and speaking of clothing this video comes out on uh 2 p.m. Eastern November 10th 2023 and for the next 3 days three days the merch store is open the first ever Gotham branded merch we got the goatee nice and clean in my opinion there's different color combinations and if you don't like the goatee or you don't like a hoodie we got sweatpants we got t-shirts but if you don't like the goatee well good news because we have the G crown and this also comes in mint blue and on black and yes I wore two hoodies for a YouTube video but more insane things have happened in the world like this game uh link is in the description my friends and uh you got three days it's going to come before Christmas get it for yourself get it as a present for somebody else three days share it with your friends it's a merch drop first ever Gotham branded very exciting stuff uh a lot of stuff going on we have the book launch we have iners fan events we got merch a lot of cool stuff and end this game end this game oh boy okay so our protagonists are Feer um which if you changed one word in that name would mean something totally different uh and FAS so we have India we have Syria we have two honorary Grandmaster titles here we go P Feer opens up with Knight to F3 black plays D5 and white very quickly turns it back into a queen Pawn game and then plays a London now black plays this very interesting move A6 this is how you know you are in the 800 level territory because nothing makes sense by the way I really like that goatee logo I I I I think it looks really nice I'm going to say I'm very happy with it the G Crown is also kind of cool you know I think it looks everybody likes different things anyway C6 E3 so far so good knight D7 black has already done several things I really hate number one black played A6 which I don't like hate hate but I like kind of hate I'm like why did you play A6 but also what about the bishop and like my friends this is this is one thing you have to keep in mind okay Knights come before Bishops more often than not all right the Bishops need a little bit of time to get into the game you can't just you can't do this and one thing I don't like about what Feer does here Feer breaks away from the traditional London setup so a lot of you have a very basic understanding of your opening but you don't exactly know where your pieces belong and the Knight just doesn't belong on C3 unless it's going to go Gallop into the position which is definitely not going to do this is a thorn bush it's just there's nothing there so what you should do is finish the pyramid and then put the Knight on D2 or the only way to put the Knight on C3 would be behind the c Pawn okay so just like little things like that now you know the D and C pawns they go together I don't like this move I don't like it you know because what do how is this Knight going to play a role in the game black plays E6 okay black building this light squared structure and I really don't like white snack's move either okay white should be trying to develop and Castle you got to give everybody a turn right now you're not going to beat anybody in five moves you're just not you're nobody can win in five moves as long as the opponent doesn't like try to lose I don't like this I like we're starting an attack but we haven't even gotten all the pieces out yet you know what I mean we don't need to play like this play the move Bishop D3 first or Bishop E2 or castle like just or Castle Queens side you know but this ah well immediately it pays off cuz now white is completely winning so the way you avoid tactical mistakes like this first of all everything in chess is a pattern you see it once you see it twice you know then you're going to get it kind of like the merch uh Bishop D6 is a pattern because this is the dark squared Bishop for black is not defended by anything which means if white makes a knight move that's useful you know that Bishop is hanging and so this move is devastating for black devastating move because it's a triple Fork it's also a discovered at deck so white emerges with a pawn up and black can't Castle now it's not it's not over but it's like very unpleasant so you guys have to be very careful putting pieces out like this that are not defended that nobody's accounting for you know why they're not defended cuz you moved every damn Pawn you own on a light Square you ever notice how top players don't play like this they don't have seven and eight pawns on light squares to start the game yeah don't do that okay of course white doesn't see that white goes Bishop G3 white goes mein mein okay but you know you you didn't really you fine but you should have developed your Bishop okay now black plays Knight E7 clearly we have a strategy here which is put the knights there instead of out to their traditional squares and again when you're 800 you need to stop inventing openings you need to stop playing chess the way you want to's nobody cares about what you want okay like I'm just going to the chess board does not care you see black blundered this again it it and black by the way could have played this move and still would have blundered this move because the bishop is not defended Knight to E7 now I I don't hate White's next move Feer plays F4 uh F4 is uh is a is a decent move it's trying to build like a Stonewall structure so castles and now both sides now the position actually looks more or less normal okay we we somehow avoided you know multiple potential explosions in the opening but now now actually things start getting very very interesting so black plays C5 and again do you notice how this Knight plays literally zero role in this game like this bishop will go here and put pressure this bishop sees that this bishop is in Black's territory what is this this Knight not white doesn't have three Bishops uh this Knight is doing nothing at all which is why it should have been here so that it could go there and there you know or there it's not doing anything here it's it's standing at an airport and there's no flights like it it's got to drive to a different airport okay now white here plays Bishop H4 I like this move very simple idea here by white I want to get my queen into the attack I want to take and then I want to go Queen H5 nice move very nice move I got to give credit where it's due black plays C4 which does in fact look like a good decision because you know you attack the bishop so The Bishop's got to go here but here Feer oh my goodness I mean Feer here plays a a gangster move danger levels the bishop is hanging but what's worth more than the bishop taking the Knight removing a key defender of the black position now if G takes F6 guess what you don't have to move your Bishop Bish back why because Checkmate is coming but what about the bishop takes yes Rook F3 now this is like some miracle stuff there is no like it's crazy black can win both pieces and just get mated there is no way to stop mate you can play Rook E8 I'll play check here and now I gotta I got to force the king back to G8 how do I do that how do I do that boom very subtle and I force a Checkmate it's a very nice little tactic now never in a million years is that happening in this game because then would be reported for cheating Bishop takes F6 black plays Pawn takes this bishop which makes a lot of sense because that Bishop is targeting you know the pawn over there now white is completely winning how do you prevent Pawn takes F6 from happening you can't move the bishop how do you prevent Pawn takes F6 from happening Pawn takes F6 is going to happen but but but but the bishop can move but you can't move the bishop what in the game of course boom boom that's what happened but how do you how do you prevent Queen G4 very nice move threatens mate the Knight cannot come play defense because of the pin there's a pin here as well so black would go here and now very simple yoink and mate is on the way and yes maybe you don't play Queen H6 but you got another mate you got you got multiple mating ideas and uh multiple mates in life cause confusion and chess multiple mates have as many as you want um C takes D3 that doesn't happen instead we have the following position so white do a pawn up white has uh a pleasant position white has all eight pawns black has seven and yet according to the computer there's no Advantage now this stockfish is accounting for stockfish versus stockfish games stockfish is not accounting for 900 versus 900 this is a very good position for white and now white very I love Rook F3 look at that that's that move deserves a heap of praise for me I love this move great move uh still going for the attack even though there's zero attack possible the way you have to start an attack in chess is generally with your Pawns but I love what white that look at this rook and can I just draw your attention to what look at all this beautiful stuff white is doing you notice how this idiot is still standing on C3 that dude is letting the rest of the pieces do the Dirty Work very very disrespectful stuff which is why you shouldn't have stationed him there on move five or what yeah literally move five and the whole game is happening as the Knight is standing around it's just standing around nothing is happening F6 now another very instructive moment here by white instead of retreating from the position white sacrifices the Knight that's a very very instructive sacrifice a knight or a bishop for two Pawns in front of an enemy King this kind of an attack can work if you have more than two pieces attacking and right now it's very close you know you're about to have more than two pieces you might even find a way for the Knight to get in maybe right so Knight takes G6 H takes G6 very very close what black has to do now is play f five what that does is gains space and you in many of these games your king is going to get chased around but your king is safe check King E7 check Bishop F6 Rook H7 Rook F7 or even here as long as there's no checks there's no checks right now the king is going to have to go on a little bit of a spiritual journey to find himself and realize that he's Super Beta and relies on on all the other pieces to do his dirty work and yet you can't even capture the damn King how stupid is chess you have this absolute Bozo he can only move one square at a time like imagine you are running right it's a it's a it's a competitive Sport and you can only take one step at a time and you get tired first of all go to the doctor you need help second of all why can't nobody take you off the board it's so dumb so dumb we need to patch this anyway um the king super super Super Beta but you can't take him and if there's no checks he's actually kind of safe and you know what now white has certain problems so Queen takes G6 black plays Rook F7 which is apparently a very bad move because now you can't stop the attack apparently white is now getting in so what do you do well black runs the king white plays Rook G3 very instructive game I told you you're going to laugh at this game but but this is a game you can actually learn something from now in this position you are trying to get the bishop right but sometimes in these positions there is an illusion there is an illusion of defense and that illusion of defense is the fact that Queen G8 is M and Rook h8 grants you access if the bishop takes Queen G8 is made I got news for you there's nothing you can do which is why black plays this move which might which this move which might have been a miracle because now Rook h8 takes the king escapes like this but here comes Rook H7 and white is so close so so so close to winning black plays B5 trying to break out excellent move just staying patient now this is one of those moments in chess you have to go backwards I say eight times out of 10 in chest sometimes even nine times at the beginner an intermediate level the best thing to do is to go forward this is not one of those cases you got to slide out of the way and the idea is to take with the rook and get the queen to the corner that's very tough to see if you don't see that maybe you try to get E4 or F5 you got to bring the Knight the Knight is the final piece of the puzzle you might even be able to play Knight takes Queen takes Rook G seven although the computer isn't as convinced but you have to find a way what you don't want to do is rush if you don't see a way in you don't want to go all in because when you go all in sometimes like in poker you're going to lose it all Rook G7 Rook G7 you don't have enough the best thing you can do now is make a draw best thing you got now again you're a rook down and you are attacking with two pieces and they're defending with the exact same two pieces you're not going to win this game and if you do the rest of the math it's this so that was White's big mistake they rushed they did not see a clear conclusion they gave away a rook for a bishop now they're stuck and now they're trading more pieces that's very bad cuz now it's Queen and Knight versus queen rook and Bishop you lose you ain't winning this game I don't care how many pawns you have I mean you are up a few pawns but they don't matter when you're playing against the rook and a bishop now what you do here is you bail out you go for the draw queen f8 queen G5 King H7 I don't care you give a check and black should try to play defense black goes here check King here and now you keep giving checks but actually the Knight despite not moving in 23 turns can participate again Knight takes D5 that's a very tough move to spot point is you're threatening all of this stuff and if this this actually you are up uh six pawns which now is pretty good so obviously that doesn't happen the king keeps running around and in this position black goes here um that's what why did Black do that I mean like it what what if you wanted to avoid checks why didn't you to go to G there's no more checks after this there's no checks of course white shouldn't trade Queens oh my God they hung and white didn't take White had like two and a half minutes on the clock here and had moved their Queen I think 10 times in a row one 2 3 four five 6 how did you how could you not play Queen Tak Queen oh my God white was so set on repeating moves white didn't win a queen white was so set on repeating moves and now now white does play Knight takes D5 because it's been 28 moves since the Knight moved and you realize it never participated and you win a couple of Pawns but it's over black plays Rook d8 that's it there's no more checks that do anything white is going to very quickly get the queen forcefully traded the bishop and the rook and the queen are all going to threaten mate it's over your pawns do not matter here this is game over and white trades the queens that is crazy how you gonna to trade the Queens here it's all you got come on give a check give a check try to be solid I don't know maybe push the pawns just don't lose the ween need five check now black I don't know what black is doing also because they're both 8900 I black goes I don't know I don't know what this stubbornness is like no I don't want to take your queen you're going to take my queen I don't know why they're and now now white says actually I don't want a queen trade now black says okay I do want a queen trade white says no I don't want a queen trade and black says fine no Queen tra now it's Queen H5 check King to G8 Queen G5 now now it actually might be a draw because you can't block because of this oh my God we're going to have a repetition of moves Queen E5 check Bishop B6 Queen C5 King F7 Queen H5 back that's it it's making a draw King D7 Queen A7 check they can't escape King C8 oh my God black is losing more pawns black is losing more pawns black lost every Pawn oh my goodness black has no pawns have you ever seen a game like this it's 8 to zero I have never seen something like this in my life material is equal it's equal material eight pawns versus a bishop and a rook that's 88 what how is this possible King E7 I mean black had like four chances to trade the queens and said like no I don't want to trade queens and now has no no pawns left queen C5 check Rook D6 oh my God now you could just push pawns you just got to be careful you don't want to go here and hang this then get mated somehow like oh my God Queen C7 check Rook D7 Queen C5 white is still very happy with the draw make no mistake Queen C5 was that three-time repetition by the way that looked very close no it's like the slightly different positioning of The Rook Queen C5 King F7 Queen H5 King G8 Queen G5 Queen G7 just don't make a draw Queen B5 okay okay good now black here should obviously start going for mate who's going to stop mate let's not forget black has the heavy artillery white has all these goofy pawns but pawns don't mean anything until they start walking Rook E7 what check Queen f8 the queen goes back Queen push the pawns you have eight pawns why are you still moving your queen A4 oh my goodness Queen G queen queen queen you said all right Queen C5 I mean how how many times are we going to play this game of like don't trade the queen trade the queen black said no I don't want to trade the nothing makes sense anymore nobody knows what they're playing for how can you possibly not trade trade Queens you just win all the pawns I mean this is this is so easily winning if the pawns are on the same color the bishop just butchers them you blockade them you put bishop and King and then you just win all the pawns what is black doing why is black moving the king when they're not even in his check black is just stuck in a zombie Loop Queen H5 check moves the King again Queen E5 repeating and finally black takes okay okay it's over okay takes it's over the bishop is going to start feasting and and just so you know like this looks scary it's it's not there's nothing you can do here because the thing is none of these pawns are actually walking into anything meaningful so King F2 Bishop B1 it doesn't matter if all the pawns are on look how easy it is to win a pawn Rook B7 and then I have to move this and then you go here and then once you start splitting the pawns apart it becomes a lot easier and they're just too slow they're just too slow this is not going to work they're too slow Bishop F5 even this now E7 Bishop takes like it just it just doesn't work it just doesn't work actually Bishop F5 technically blunders a little fork and if takes e78 got to be a little careful F5 and black plays Bishop okay everybody knows that when you can take a pawn it's better to just attack another one now you can't take anything rookie oh my goodness whoa k what about what about A4 white says you know what I'm going to run my king forward oh but it's Rook A3 but my friends this is this is like a movie this is Sparta right here the 300 soldiers that held it down this is the king and his and his pawns he stood there and went each of you will die for a good cause today this is Sparta and he just runs forward Rook to A3 hunting down one of the last seven pawns remaining H4 Rook takes B3 the the king defends a third Pawn has fallen b a c the entire Queen side has collapsed but the King has joined forces with the center pawns and the two flank pawns the board is now going to get cut in half as black tries to systematically blockade the pawns and win them one by one and then deliver a checkmate with King and Rook because black doesn't have any pawns black can't promote to a queen G4 Bishop D5 blockading King to G5 a fatal mistake white needed to advance the pawns together like this that would have gotten him somewhere that would have been really dangerous but instead he accidentally abandoned the pawn on the back ranks it's over he's lost half of his pawns and that's very important because that pawn was the base of the chain and now he's going to lose both of those pawns as well H5 you don't stress the pawns are walking to their death you go Rook E4 King F5 you lose this Pawn you're down to three you ain't saving this game with three at that point black can even sack the bishop and this is just a very very very well-known end game how to win instead after this white goes for this Pawn I don't hate it but it might be a little bit slow King to H4 you definitely don't want to play King H4 you don't want to play King H4 it's better to be in the center if you get your king cut off on the edge of the board he loses access to so many squares you have to keep the king in the center if you want to survive but Rook to G1 G5 Bishop to E6 white is running out of options Rook to G4 is a mistake Rook to G4 is a mistake because the king runs forward but it comes at the cost of yet Pawn which black forgets to capture Rook to G2 oh my goodness the King has broken in the king is now shielded by his own pawns black is panicking even though there's no reason to panic because again both of these pawns are walking to the king you have time Rook G4 and take then go back and take this pawn bishop F7 check you don't need to give checks you don't need to give checks because now the King has accidentally been giving a golden ticket to the center of the board he's going to join the other pawns oh my goodness Rook D2 finally finally uh black has regained their composure but it's a little late you allowed the king King to Traverse the entire board and now the H Pawn can be used as a deflector H7 check King G7 this is actually by a miracle a draw because the Rook cannot stop the king and the pawn this king is blocking this other oh my goodness oh my goodness but white for whatever reason with four passing pawns moves the king and suddenly loses one of his most important pawns and instead of pushing his most advanced Pawn pushes this [Music] oh oh no no no no and now any bishop move is safe again even something like Bishop B8 H7 as long as you don't go here you go here I there's nothing I can do there's nothing G7 take King E7 I take E6 I can go here there's no way something like Rook E4 Rook there's nothing here and unfortunately in this position black takes black takes the pawn and now it's king and two pawns versus King and Rook Black's King has to monitor both because if the black king goes to win this Pawn the king will slide in Rook G4 check King to F6 and white pushes his last remaining Pawn all the way to E7 Rook F4 check King to E6 Rook E4 check and this game is decided by one square because if the king could get right there it would be over but the king can only get to G7 E8 would Queen at which point we would be left with King versus King Rook D4 and now King to E8 sliding behind the pawn and now black plays this and White's King is stalemated and mummified behind his final Pawn he made it the entire length of the board to be frozen in a capsule with the one Pawn that survived the apocalypse what a movie like moment it was the king and eight pawns black needed to keep his nerves winning all the pawns one by one but instead for some reason he lost his Focus the king managed to go all the way to E7 and that was it King F6 and this game was thrown away but then saved at at the last moment by white wow you talk about a movie finish friends if you made it this far in the video friendly reminder Gotham merch out for the next few days that's all I have for you today get out of here
