perfect completely unresponsive hard lock system this is great I finally finished the Intel Arc challenge I go back to my RTX 39 and I'm like yeah I'm gonna have a stable system again and actually have nothing but problems with it but I told myself between nvidia's price hikes and their attitude I am skipping the 40 series which leaves me with what for options I mean Once Upon a Time 15 years ago I daily drove the Radeon 3870 but I haven't touched an AMD GPU at least not in my daily driver system for 15 years have they reached the point where they're usable they've certainly reached the point where they're my only feasible option for an upgrade so this is it that's right folks it's time for the AMD challenge sponsored if I see Sonic I will be running AMD for the next 30 days and I will be bringing along with me two of my very picky Tech Enthusiast friends Jake and Luke to share with you our experience so come along for the ride and uh I hope you've got a great power supply did I mention this is brought to you by C Sonic because whether you're team green or team red these days You're gonna need something pretty powerful in all seriousness I am not really expecting this to be as much of a Gong Show as the Intel version was AMD unlike Intel has been doing dedicated graphics for well ever since they acquired ATI which is I guess over 15 years now but in that time their software team has made enormous strides in terms of both compatibility and performance that is at least if the community's reviews of Radeon graphics cards aren't anything to go by they've certainly ran into some challenges with the 7000 series they had some issues with defective Vapor Chambers causing unusually high temperatures but that shouldn't affect me because I'm not using an AMD reference card so with confidence I'm going ahead to why is this still on you guys watched me turn it off what can I say I'm just a lot better at turning things on than turning them off all three of us went with the R9 7900 100 XT X so the more premium version and you know normally you don't look at the top tier card and go yeah that one's probably the better value but somehow AMD managed to pull it off the 7900 XT is cut down so much that for the hundred dollars you're saving compared to the XTX it really doesn't look like a very compelling option the XTX on the other hand as long as a major Focus for you isn't Ray Trace titles it's performance in traditional games is extremely compelling you can get more details about it in our full review of the 7900 series that we uploaded a little while back now of course the card that we were covering was the reference card from AMD this one uh is uh quite a bit beefier to the point where oh God we might actually have a clearance issue here oh god um Jake can I help you well I'm just oh God him for the same reason you're oh godding we've come up with a solution massive thanks to gigabyte for sending over this aoris card but I guess I get to use a reference card now the last thing we want is for any of this coolant to get into our high quality see Sonic power supply did I mention they sponsored this video so I'm just going to put this high quality short circuit hoodie very absorbent in the way and make sure that we don't get any water in it oh this is going to be so easy because amd's drivers are not going to be a problem um at least that's my hope because in my review of this card I kind of committed to switching to team red so I really regardless of whether it's an ARS card or a reference card I really need this thing to be good it uses amd's rdna3 architecture which is all new for the 7000 series it brings with it a huge uplifting clock speed cus or compute units AI accelerators and perhaps for me most importantly their video encoding engine has gotten a complete overhaul including support for av1 which isn't supported on streaming platforms like twitch yet but will hopefully be coming very very soon one of the other things that's really cool about amd's rdna3 cards is I mean not necessarily going to excite you from a performance standpoint but could excite you from a cost standpoint instead of building these cards using a monolithic or a single large die they used a chiplet approach similar to what they've done with their ryzen CPUs so instead of using the latest manufacturing process for the entire Die they actually use tsmc's six nanometer for their memory and cash dies since they found that there wasn't really a benefit to shrinking it down and then they used their five nanometer process for their compute die so that's where you're actually still getting good scaling in terms of power consumption and performance I mean they're still really expensive but like I guess we'll take the little W's when we can get them another thing we can do while we wait is refill the loop because the parts aren't actually here for my 7950x upgrade I'm just going to be running a bypass so the GPU will not be water cooled during this experiment this also allows me to like just go back to the 3090 if I decide yeah you know what it's really not worth the extra performance Jake we cheated a little bit he's actually already done his upgrade we're shooting out of order he says it's pretty good though right off the bat I'm running into a bit of an issue because my current graphics card is RTX 3080 from EVGA rest in peace just barely fits fortunately it's close this guy not even close so I think what I'm gonna do there's a little bit of extra space on this bracket I think I'm going to take the pump out and this bracket and drill new holes just about that much higher so that the GPU in this slot can clear it no is that the one mine is stripped damn it hey this much work just to swap an air-cooled graphics card originally the pump Circle bracket thing was using those two holes but what I found out is there's an extra set of holes in the middle so if I put the bottom holes of the Ring thing in the middle hole then I probably don't even need to drill anything I'm I think I'm going to anyways but I could just put those two screws in and that would probably be enough look at that a hole which hopefully fits this screw it looks mint I mean the holes were a little too close together but it'll work and that's that's what matters hi Arlo and there it is the top of the res hits these tubes it's only screwed in with the top two holes here which don't line up with anything on the bottom because all of those are stripped out and now theoretically this fits hey it works I don't know why the lights are in like seizure mode right now but we get that sorted this is less of an installation video and more of a aftermath explanation video I decided that either the GPU or the reservoir was gonna have to go and as the GPU going was less work that was kind of where I landed so I got this really long PCI Express Riser cable and decided to mount the GPU on top of the computer so the graphics card just sits there except that it was overloading my power supply all the time so there's another power supply in the back powering just the graphics card and it's all mounted on the top would see Sonic trust someone irresponsible enough to pour water over a powered on computer it's fine they make high quality power supplies great efficiency long warranties super quiet can't go wrong yeah well no not that thing no matter what your computer is see Sonic's got you covered even if you got a big Power hog like this thing no that's the only reference one we have it's a very bad I hope you catch it oh my gosh it would have come right out like it just opens Jake these people set me up for failure you know it doesn't take much holy crap is this still too long Jake it's too long hold on okay no it fits it fits is it too tall though oh no it's not two slots it's two and change oh no we have to use the Riser all along wait what no oh no no no no no accusing a riser I'm not catching that okay it's just gonna hit you then I got another one here you ready oh no fine oh my God that's the only one we have that way I get to use the coolioris one too dual bios so you got the silent and the OC version triple fans yeah triple fan I mean they're both triple fans but this one's triple fans on a big fat heat sink how am I gonna secure the GPU David do you ever think of that it's double-sided tape oh honestly what I was planning to do was put it right here really I mean on top of the water tube why not it's a it's a solid it's a hard line water cooling tube yeah until you put too much pressure I was thinking just kind of like that I just put it on there that is significantly better than what you had before all right I'll allow it what is postcode F3 I'm looking it up F3 blah blah blah let me turn it on like well it's Q flash something something F3 we got it what did you change I did nothing I plugged in the keyboard I didn't change anything maybe F3 means F3 just mean keyboard not found why would the system not post over that well hold on that's probably just because you turn it off a bunch of times oh uh oh uh oh no I bet the BIOS reset and I'm using like stupid AMD stupid nvme stupid raid I better not have just lost my boot OS I vote we go to bios for a moment okay and we look at the pcie devices and maybe one of your nvme's just happened to die in this process like to do raid zero them yeah why it's for Speed it's like single threaded anyways AMD rate is garbage so it's not even a the car doesn't even have raid it's just one of those four oh my God oh Linus I know what the problem is you turn the power off like multiple times I was trying to do Windows updates I was trying to do Windows updates I turned the power off one time oh thanks Windows good timing Windows update yeah but then remember when you're doing the maintenance you turn it on and off and on and off like a bunch of times I guess this shouldn't be on right now okay just power it off hey why is this still on I think you corrupted your own Windows install got a windows installed disc it's just it's one of those things where like honestly I don't know 95 times out of 100 you interrupt a Windows update it'll like figure it out yeah when you're trying to film a video and you have a GPU on a rise or outside your computer and you've got water potentially dripping and it's no after the end of the day and it's over time now here's the update we have a completely different GPU with a completely different drive we have removed the drive that we think has the corrupted Windows on it and we are still getting that same error you know what it reminds me of it's behaving like the bootloader is on one storage device but then the actual operating system files are on another on two drives yeah both of them yeah which I've seen a lot of times but the problem is that I don't have two storage devices in here no so what is happening I don't know I'm at a loss man total loss especially since we put the 3090 back in like in the slot and it still didn't go it's like an hour and a half later I think and the computer's working now so what ended up being the problem I'm pretty sure is there was some weird configuration in the Bios because of the raid setup so I ended up taking the CMOS battery out putting it back in and the system booted right up installing the drivers went totally fine we had to install chipset driver since this is from an Intel system that also went fine so it seems like everything's working great it looks like there were two contributing factors one I think Jake was right there must have been some kind of BIOS corruption and two he might have been also right about this it looks like there was a pcie resource allocation problem so in order to get it to boot up reliably I not only had to enable above 4G decoding but I also had to remove both my network card and my Thunderbolt card so I only have that carrier card for the 4m.2 ssds and my GPU in here I'm using these Optical USB things from ikron to handle USB and then I'm just running an optical DisplayPort cable straight up here Thunderbolt is not working at all after a couple small issues with the optical DisplayPort cable that's running downstairs to the gaming room I've got it running here so that seems to suggest there's no incompatibility with optical cables but I'm running into something entirely new um see if I can get my mouse here there we go USB is just cutting out for you know three to five seconds at a time periodically and I'm moving my mouse continuously [ __ ] there it goes yeah see hello nothing there it is and it's not just the mouse it's the keyboard as well just USB connectivity cuts out devices don't do they don't disconnect and come back they're just going so I'm gonna try a chipset driver update okay Mouse working fine chipset drivers who are what did the trick there it is wait what is that no um okay I mean I'm pretty sure this is running higher than I had it before with the 30 90. well I haven't played in a while that's for sure got him got him got him let's go no performance issues no hitching no nothing let's go come on ah okay that was three ball kills though I'm feeling pretty good about that where's the ball someone have it what the hell are you guys doing bloody hell stop putting it down and he threw it at me it's a bloody objective map you don't just go for kills what sucks is my teammates aren't even that bad from just like uh playing FPS standpoint they're just not playing the objective do these idiots not understand how the mode works hold the ball where are you going Can't Blame my GPU game ran great just like this great segue to our sponsor all right well regardless the computer works but there's no segue to a sponsor because the sponsor I see Sonic so thanks to csonic check them out in the link in the description if you liked this video maybe go watch the Intel Arc one because that was just as much chaos I don't actually know if it no it wasn't as much this is awful no none of this has been amd's fault so far the actual AMD experience has been totally fine
