- So you're okay with me
cutting the final rope? - Oh my God. - We're cutting the final rope. - [Jimmy] Three, two, one, cut. This could equal a $1000,000. (wild cheering) (tape rewinding) How's it feel? - It's kinda scary. - [Jimmy] And welcome
to the number two slot. How you feel? - I'm good. I'm ready to win. - [Jimmy] Is this easier or harder than you thought it would be? - I'm not gonna say cuz
y'all gonna make it harder. - How do you feel? - I'm freakin' out, not gonna lie. I have a huge fear of heights. - [Jimmy] Last one of you guys to fall into this pool of water gets the chance at $1000,000. - No way! - And here's what I mean by that. We are doing four "Last To Leave" videos and the winners of each will compete in a fifth video for $1000,000. (register ringing) You're currently watching
Part One of this series. I don't care who wins, but whoever does will
fly back in a few weeks and compete against the other winners for a $1000,000. This is arguably the most
extreme thing we've ever done. See this cage? We took it from "American Warrior Ninja." That thing. We put some ropes and
we put some people on it and we grabbed a $1000,000. And that's how we ended up here. So as I said, Chris, we're
doing four "Last To Leaves." This is the first one. And the winners of all four compete in a fifth one for $1000,000 which means there's three more. - So how you gonna pick
all the other people? - I'm glad you asked. Here's how. If you buy merch or
follow me on Instagram, you'll be entered. It's that simple. We're gonna randomly pick people who follow me on Instagram or people who buy merch in between now and the next few challenges and we're gonna invite
'em down to compete. And I'll remind you about
that at the end of the video. So we gave each of you guys a coach and we made them wear the same shirt so the viewers could tell. Cameron, your coach is Chris. Alberto, you have Marcus. Colbey, we brought you a Chandler. - Yes.
- Yes. - [Game Master] So you can go ahead and just get out now.
- I'm the best. - No, don't say that. Sorry. - [Jimmy] And you are
assigned the big guy. So there you go. You each have a coach. They'll get you whatever you need. Whoever falls last gets to move on and compete for $1000,000. Good luck. - I wanna see if I can get you a bottle of water right up there. Let's give it a shot. - [Chris] Kobe! - Catch.
- Aah. - Aah.
- Ooh. - Cameron, this matches your shirt. - Ooh.
(laughing) - Catch. - [Jimmy] Oh, good catch. - A banana for you.
- Oh my God. - [Jimmy] A banana for you.
- Wait, wait- - Ooh!
- Oh! (hands clapping)
- OH! - [Jimmy] He didn't even move. (hands clapping) - Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh. - So Chris, we're gonna
do our first challenge. There's seats behind you. And you can earn time for sitting to help you win. The first challenge for
one minute of sitting, you have to throw your contestant this egg and he has to toss it
back without it crack and if you do that, he can sit. - Dude, I was never good at sports. - Hundred. - Ooh.
(water splashing) - Aah.
- Ooh. - All right. (laughing) Bloop. All right, Marcus. - Got it. - Oh my God!
- You coulda- - Here's an egg. Great shot. If Chandler catches this, you get a sit. - Oh.
- Ooh! - No cracks. So since they completed the egg challenge she gets a little bit of sitting time. There's your seat. Colbey gets to sit for the next minute. Congrats, you're helping your contestant. While Colbey's wrapping
up her sitting time let's see if you can earn him some. - Perfect. - Ah! It is perfect.
(hands clapping) I will lower the seat. So Colbey, your minute is up. Stand up, try not to fall. And now we will take her seat back and Jake's contestant
won some sitting time. So give him his seat. - [Jake] Coming down behind you. Up, there it, yeah. - One final thing. If your contestant wins
they go on to compete for a $1000,000.
- Right. - To incentivize you guys
to help your players win, if they win the $1000,000
they have to give you 10%. - Whoo.
- You better win. - To incentivize you guys. - I'll get you anything you need. - That's a hundred grand
- You know I got you. - and they still win 900 grand. Now that you guys also
have money on the line let's do the egg challenge again, but from further back. This time it's for five
minutes instead of one. - what else would you do?
- I'd smoke chips. - Don't cross that. We have a $1000,000 on the line and our markers a bag of chips. This time we'll just do if he catches it he can sit for five minutes.
- I've got you. You want to. - Huh!
- Aah. - That's good.
(laughing) - [Chris] Did that go between his legs? - Yeah, it did. - Not it.
- Nope. - OH!
(hands clapping) - Wait! What? What?
(Chandler shouting) - [Jimmy] That's five
minutes. I'll go lower it. Here you go Colbey. - How do I do that? - I bet he's not gonna catch it. - Oh my God. (egg smashing) - Oh.
- Ooh no. - Does that count? - It drops.
- Yeah. (egg smashing) - Oh my God.
(laughing) - Sports, not good at it. - [Jimmy] So who thinks they're in first place right now? - I mean honestly, right here. - [Jimmy] You think you're in first place? - Yeah.
- Who said? - Ooh!
(siren howling) - That was sabotage. You have to do 10 laps round the pool. You can't throw things at the competitors. - I can do what I want. - When I smell sabotage
the lights turn red and the alarm comes out.
(siren howling) - This is gonna be cold. (water splashing) Whoo! This is so cold. (funny bouncy music) - Well there we go. There's one lap. - This is what happens to sabotagers here. - I'm cold. (suspenseful music) - [Chris] It's getting
a bit more difficult. - Now it's time for our first incentive. This is the unicorn of gifts. First person to get
out can have an iPhone, AirPods, Beats and a PS4. Just consider. I don't care who. (crickets chirping) - Nobody, really? - No one wants a unicorn of love? All right, they're being stubborn. Someone get me a knife. - Wait a minute. What? - Things are lasting
a while. Red light me. (crosstalk) Ooh, alright there we go. (all laughing) We'll just cut this rope. - Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. - No, no. - Oh.
- Ooh! - Okay, I'll-
- Ooh hoo. - They're down to 16 ropes. - [Chandler] Are you going again? Oh.
- 15. Five of the 20 ropes are gone. How does it feel? - There's a big difference , but- - I don't believe you. I'm cuttin' more. (laughing) - All right. Turn the
lights back to normal. We're good. - Try again. - Ooh. Hah aha. (laughing)
- You almost got him out. - [Jimmy] Bye then.
(xylophone music) - Testing.
- OOH! (laughing)
(xylophone music) - You guys have 10
minutes to draw a portrait of your contestant. I will then let people on my social media vote with a poll for the best one. The viewers will decide. Whoever they vote gets 10 minutes of sitting down. Three, two, one.
(hands clapping) (high energy music) - [Jimmy] You know, Chandler, I can't say I'm impressed. - You can't tell what that is though? It looks exactly like
what she's doing, right? - [Jimmy] Oh Chris, that looks good. Trees are lit. (fast guitar music) - Hey, you ready for this?
- Oh my God. - Oh, that's actually not that bad. - Get ready for this masterpiece. - Hold it up man.
(laughing) - You like it?
- I love it. - You see it right? - [Jimmy] Ah, yeah, no.
- We're not sure. - No? - Are you ready for this? - That is awesome. I
like the loser signs on. - I drew everything. So I think this is a winner, you know? - Are you ready for the beautiful? I got the peach fuzz and everything. It's got a W on your chest. You wanna know why? Winner. - So I put a poll out on social media, which by the way, follow my Instagram if you wanna potentially
be here next competition. But regardless, I let you guys vote. And you guys decided
that Jake is the winner. - What?
- What? - Yeah. The winner of nothing. Chris actually won!
(laughing) - [Jimmy] So sad. You threw him on the ground. (knee thudding)
- It didn't work. - Oh, how does that feel man? - Feels amazing. - Dah, look at him. He's laying all the way back. You guys are jelly right now. (trumpet music) - [Jimmy] It's been getting pretty tough. So I want you to call a family member and try to get some motivation. Hey, how's it going? Your brother is suspended above a pool and there's four other people. Whoever gets out last gets to compete for a $1000,000. - Oh my gosh. - Hey mom. So I didn't tell you, cuz you'd go off on me probably. - Why aren't you calling
me from your cell phone? - Mom, it's a competition.
I can't have my phone. I'm competing to win a $1000,000. (speaking foreign language)
- Ah. (chuckling) - She was saying, "Oh my
God, are you serious?" - Hey, what's up dad? If I win this one, then
I go back in December and have a chance to win a $1000,000. - You what? That's great, man. - All right, contestants. The unicorn of wealth is coming back. For whoever gets out next we have some Beats, some AirPods, an iPhone, an Xbox1, a PS4. That's what was up there earlier. And now we're adding in a MacBook Pro - Ooh.
- Ooh. - and some PS4 video games. - Ooh. - All you have to do is get out now and you can have 'em. Even if you win here today you're not guaranteed a million dollars. - That's a lot of stuff though. - It's about $3,500. - Go ahead and do it, somebody do it. - See, right about now is where Chandler would get out. - Actually way earlier.
- Yeah, way earlier. - No, I'm just saying like, that's a lot of stuff, man. Like, you know, if you
could go along with- - So is a $1000,000.
- I know. - He's considering it. (crosstalk) - You gotta jump now.
(violins playing) - [Narrator] You're
fulfilling your destiny. (violins playing) - Wait. What?
(water splashing) - Oh.
- Oh. (wild screaming) - Oh God.
(wild screaming) - [Jimmy] What would your mother say to you right now? - Oh my God. He gave up a $1000,000. He gave up 900 big ones and gave up your hundred. - We have three more of these where you'll also be a coach and so you still have other chances. - It's okay. - Follow me on Instagram or buy merch. You could have a chance. So here's all your items. - Tell me how you were feeling
when you were up there. - I was already in pain. It feels good not to be out there anymore though.
- Yeah. You were up there for
- That's no joke. - 13 hours.
- 13 hours? - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. - Well, thanks for comin'. Appreciate it. I hope you had fun.
- Yeah. - Alberto.
- It was pretty awesome. I was blessed.
- You did a good job, bro. - [Jimmy] There's only three of you now. How does that make you feel? - I feel hyped. Yeah, I feel optimistic. - [Jimmy] Colbey, how do
you feel now that he's gone? - I'm ready. I'm hyped. - [Jimmy] How about you, Cameron? - I feel like I got more space to kinda just do what I want and I feel more confident now. - [Jimmy] One of you will get a chance at winning a 1000,000. The other two, nothing. So, good luck. She's movin' over to close the gap. - In honor of Alberto's exit we should cut a rope. You're right actually. In honor of his exit. Red lights. We started with 20 ropes. We're down to 15. I think we'll just do this. So now we're down to 14. Now we're just gonna,
- Oh. - 13. I'll let you guys vote. Should I count one more?
- No. - [Jimmy] What do you think, Akira? - Yeah. - Colbey, what do you think? - I mean, obviously. - Okay, that's two yesses. - Aah.
- Ooh. - You wanna get this over with. If I cut another, that puts us at 12.
- Wow. - We're dropping ropes. 12 it is.
- Wow. - You guys are running
outta things to stand on. Lights back to normal. We'll cut some more ropes later. Just kidding! Turn the red lights back on. (laughing)
- Oh my God. - [ Chris] Jimmy's not playin" with 'em. - Psyched, that was just
a joke. Normal lights. (laughing)
- Oh my God. - How many hours have we been up here? - Chrissy. Wakey, wakey. Jakey. Wakey, wakey. - [Chris] Why is there a
French fry on his head? - [Jimmy] Each of you three still have a contestant left. What do you wanna say to Cameron? - He knows he's a beast and a warrior. - [Jimmy] What do you wanna say? - You're doing amazing. - [Jimmy] You? Awesome. If someone gets out within the next minute I'll give them $5,000. (water splashing) (heavy bass music) - He knows he's a beast and a warrior. You love to see it.
- Whoo! - That's what you wake up to today. - Yep.
- I tried man. I was dyin' for a long time up there. - You coulda had it easy, man. - He looks like he's going pretty strong. - [Jimmy] What are you
do with that $5,000? - I'm gonna donate some trees. Maybe go do some shopping. - He tried his best. Hey, at least he didn't
go home empty handed. Poor Colbey's gonna go home empty handed. - [Jimmy] Your contestant
and your contestant remain. - Yeah. - [Jimmy] Now that Cameron
has gone it is you two fighting for a chance at $1000,000. - Whoo! - [Jimmy] So we'll start
off with you Colbey. Cameron's gone. How you feeling? - I couldn't be more confident. I'm here to win the million. How about you? How are things going now? - 48. - He's lasted 48 hours?
- 48. Let's go. - [Jimmy] Okay, whenever
you get tired remember a $1000,000 is a lot and your brother would be really sad if you didn't win it. Okay, have fun. (heavy bass music) So Chandler had to leave. So we're gonna put you
in charge of Colbey. - Whoo.
(laughing) - For the next minute it'll be 10 grand if someone gets out. Then it draws back to seven. - You can do better, Akira. - You have 55 seconds to decide and then it falls back to seven grand. - That's pushin' it. That's a lot. - You have 40 seconds to win 10 grand. You can just lose in the $1000,000 round and get nothing. Where right now you can
walk away with 10 grand. - 10 grand. We were waitin' on this. - Akira, you could take that 10 K and split it with your twin. He'd be happy with it. - Or you can play for this million and potentially win a $1000,000. - But we're in to win it. - Yeah! - Five, four, three, two, one.
- He's gonna jump. - We came to win.
(hands clapping) We came to win! - That is a very tired but determined man. - I love that, Akira. - Seven grand still on the
table. Take it whenever. Rope cutting time. Once I start cutting some ropes one of you are gonna fall. - [Jake] Here we go. - [Jimmy] One down. - [Jake] That's two. - [Jimmy] Three down. Akira.
- Yeah. Make the call. You want one more?
- Yeah do it. - Hey! - I don't know how many you're hangin' on, but it's not many. All right. Good luck. (heavy bass music) - Here you go. Follow me. - How far back we going? We going out here? - If he doesn't catch
it I cut another rope. - You gotta catch it. - You ready?
- Yeah sure. Why not? - Yay! - Whoop. Throwing there. - All right.
- So close. - Marky Mark, Chandler disappeared. So, you're in charge. Here you go. - All right. You ready Colbey? - Right here at me. - Oh!
- I don't believe it. - Two ropes it is. - [Akira] Oh my God. Two ropes. - Red light me. Here we go. One, two, three, four, five, six ropes. (suspenseful music) - Oh, now let's go to the other side. Knife me. And now there's four ropes. Should we just do one more on each side and just get it done with? Akira, do you agree?
- Yeah. - Okay.
- Oh oh. - [Jimmy] Aah.
- Aah! - There are now three ropes remaining. (heavy bass music) - You can win 7,000. You know what? You gotta jump in the pool. - You guys just don't budge. What do you want me to do? Just cut it down to one rope? - Let's do it.
- Let's do it? - Yeah. - Let's ask our consultant. Cameron, you were up there. You know how they feel. Should we go down to one rope? - They've been up there quite some time. So I say, "Yeah." - Say no more, one rope. Red lights. Three ropes remain. I know you feel different now. Y'all feeling that? - Yeah. - Yeah.
- Yeah. - Okay. To the other side. Still 10 grand. Anyone want it? I'm tryin' to end your suffering. So we cut one over there. - Ho! - One rope remains. (xylophone music) There's officially one rope left. We could cut the last rope
- Neh eh. - and do last fall water. - It'll be a shootout. - But I'd only do it if
you both agree to it. You wanna do it, Colbey? - I mean, we might as
well get it over with. - So you're okay with me
cutting the final rope? - Oh my God. - We're cutting the final rope. - We're about to cut the rope. What's going through your mind? - I'm just thinkin' about my brothers and my family back home. - Aw, I'm cheering for you. So what's going through your mind, Colbey? How long do you think you'll hang? - Not very long. I'm a weakling, so. - Well, you agreed to it so we'll do it. They both agreed to this. Let it be known. 30 ish hours comes down to this. Jake and Marcus are gonna cut the rope on both sides at the same time and whoever can hang the longest wins. Whoever loses will still get 10 grand, cuz why not? Three, two, one, cut! - Oof!
- Come on, Colbey. - You got it.
- Let's go. (wild cheering) - This could equal $1000,000. (wild cheering) - I can't move my legs. - But you just won 10000 though. - Yeah. - And here is our winner. He is going on to compete for $1000,000 in a few weeks. If you want a chance
to compete against him make sure you follow me

You can face 'em for $1000,000. - Nah, this one's for my brother. - I think we should call him. - [Marc] Yeah, let's see what he says. - I think we should call him. - [Jimmy] Guess what your brother did. - Oh my gosh, please tell me you won. - Yeah bro.
- Yeah, he did. He got the dough. - She'll like this. - No. Hey I did it for you bro, 'cause I know this means a lot to you. I know you wish you coulda been here. So I been there for you guys.
