I have to stop being apologetic about it women want strong men and men want feminine women they want their women to be women and women want their men to be men okay let's just say it all right there's this collapse of the sexist into kind of this uniform totalitarian egalitarianism because that's what it becomes it's death to the soul it's even more complex than what you're saying because the desire that men have for women to be feminine the desire that women want men to be masculine because there's this totalitarian egalitarian you know Fusion of everything it also creates strange parasitic extreme male figures and so what you end up having is you have a weird parasitic version of of hyper masculinity which becomes popular and things like gangster rap or you know 50 Shades of Gray all these images violent dangerous men and then you have these insane kind of horror almost like prostitute images of hyper feminine broken down images and they become extremely popular so on the one hand you have this idea that we ought to be the same and then you have these figures that look like caricature of a caricature of a caricature of what a man and a woman is yeah it becomes freakish the distortions become freakish because if everything is melded together it's the only thing that you can see yeah it's the only indication of of Distinction left which still conversely affirms that the fundamental distinction the binary is true this is Jonathan Pedro welcome to the symbolic world [Applause] so hello everybody I am very happy and honored to be here with Father Hans Jacobs I have known father Hans for several years uh I actually have a very uh powerful moment where he prayed for me several years ago at the very outset of my speaking engagement and I was very uh I was very encouraged and touched by his the work that he's doing and I've seen that he's doing all this amazing work with young men he is a priest at the Saint Peter's Church Orthodox St Peter's Church Orthodox uh in Florida he is also the leader of the saint paisio's Brotherhood which is a movement that is looking to help young men to find their way to find a positive and healthy masculinity in their lives but in the church as well and so father Hans thank you for talking to me yeah my pleasure Jonathan's great to be here it's good to see you again too yeah it's good to see you so father Hans tell me a little bit about what you see as the situation let's say in terms of masculinity in the society but in the church as well and also what it is that you what you see as a as a way out or as a way forward um it it came out of a personal crisis Jonathan which I won't go into detail but basically I was brought to a place and it's by the hand of God it really was where um you know I was an honest kind of a cultural Warrior and I kind of was right and then some events happened in my life to really cause me to rethink that I took three years I took three years and it was a humbling experience but those experiences are good and long story short I prayed one day and I said Lord what do you want me to do what am I supposed to do and quite literally he said open your eyes meanwhile some young men entered my life and and um I began to help them learned a lot and the opening eyes moment was this that there were guys falling off the cliff they were falling into the fire right and instead of me trying to change you know the the culture politically and and socially and all that you know writing articles and all that I just started dealing with these guys one-on-one and those are the people that God brought into my life and I began to see what the problems really were and I began to learn how to deal with them and I did that for about five years and then I was invited by Father Patrick Henry Reardon to speak at a touchstone conference and I brought some of this stuff together and I gave a talk and after that talk it went on a slow viral and these young men started calling me up from all over the country that's when I realized that that what I had been given here it's a discovery but but what I have been given to by the Lord um it was very powerful it was very very powerful and and and men were healed by it men were healed by it and it had a lot to do but coming out of what I call coming out of the Matrix okay and the Matrix is really a cultural form is what it is and uh and even the gospel is reduced just to propositions you and Jordan Peterson talk about that a lot and it's very effective it's very very effective and I use a lot of what both of you come up with because it's you've thought through it and you you give me concise ways to say it and I call it the Matrix so the guys want to come out of the Matrix you know boys want to become men but they don't know how and the masculinity in the culture is so denigrated but so is the Christianity it's just reduced to propositions is what it is which which you know on a I would say on a psychological spiritual soul level um it it it's basically behavior modification and it doesn't work and we need Soul transformation and that's the beauty of Orthodoxy it's the the the power of of of the Orthodox Faith but really Christ and the transformation of the soul and of the human person well started bringing that forward and see these men healed and it's I have to say it's the most meaningful work I've ever done in my life that's what it is in a nutshell Jonathan but what does it look like in terms of the type of practices or the type of of of work that you're doing with them well it's a lot of one-on-one and a lot over the phone and I talked to a lot of guys I talked to probably three or four guys every day you know that adds up over the month right I don't even look at my minutes anymore but like I say I've got the uh what is it the extended unlimited plan right I got a good phone yeah but I grow to love these guys and these guys really take the council you know there's something about the beauty of Truth and it's this I mean truth has to be spoken it has to be spoken and Truth enters the world first through a word through what is spoken and and you know truth itself is self-verifying um there's nothing higher than the truth okay the truth is the truth and but there's a resonance in the soul that occurs to the man who hears it and is seeking truth truth of course manifests itself ultimately as Jesus Christ because he is the truth and truth thus is ultimately very personal so the transformation in in the heart and the heart is the center of the soul the transformation of the man occurs deep on the inside and and here you know the scriptures are so beautiful because it is a seed planted it is a seed planted and that that seed germinates and grows and you see the transformation in these men it's just beautiful it's one of the most beautiful things I've ever I've ever seen and it it happens in a again and again to see to see a person grow into what I call their personal particularity right to become a true Son of God and then to become their own man because those things work hand in hand they don't work separately right and and it it's it's really a wondrous thing it's it's a recreation that that I'm privileged to see with my own eyes brings great meaning to life and and and it posits them so one-on-one initially a lot of encouragement and just simple instruction but out of that that's how it started but out of that I realized that this problem is is is really huge and that there are many men many men who want a more solid sense of their own masculinity and there's no place to find it there really is not and so this also presents a very unique opportunity for the church and I think the means by which the gospel will be spread um in our cultural particularity all right every generation is different every generation has its own problems so out of that out of that group the concept of the Brotherhood and which I just starred and two men came to me and said we had to start this and I I I'm uh cautious now of committing myself to things because I've had a lot of false starts in my life and I realize you know just don't fly off and do something just because it's good it sounds good and and uh I thought about it for six months and prayed about it and said yeah we have to do this and so we started the Brotherhood and we're building that out now again it's a learning as you go operation but we're getting there and it's getting some traction and my goal is this is to build brotherhoods all around the country that's what I want to do that's my goal because it's through Brotherhood it's through Brotherhood that men find themselves so so what I say now and I say to lot is men learn how to become a man from other men and that requires Brotherhood and that requires real authentic communion between men because we draw our masculinity from each other and this fits perfectly with Orthodox anthropology you know there is no such thing as a single individual and it ties into um and this is where I find your work so helpful Sean it's Jonathan um it ties into the very structure of the creation you know there's a congruency between the structure of the soul and the structure of of creation and there's a particular order to that but it's ontological okay it's not a schematic you know it's not a drawing of a computer chip that you look at in this great complexity it's not that it's it's it's alive and the and the energy that energy that that vivifies it all is Love Is Love right and and this love itself has character because it flows from God and and the fathers teach us yes that the characters virtue the cultivation of virtue and the conservation of virtue is actually what brings the structure was a which is latent into life like looking at an animation of a topographic map then all of a sudden you know the mountains form and The Valleys form and you can see it in 3D that's what it's like right and it just flows with this beautiful creative benevolent energy which is actually reveals to us the character of God the beauty of the creation and the fundamental goodness of man and you see this and you know the guys that come in just really beat down really really beat down just defeated but there's something in their soul that longs for this life and again you start explaining it to them and it resonates that's the truth right that's how the truth Works in US it begins it begins with language it really begins with a language but why wouldn't it be any other way Jonathan because the world was created by speech right God said let there be light and there was light and you know that they um I'm getting a little excited here I know this but what's so beautiful about this is you know the power of that primordial word that is replicated in the preaching of the Gospel that is because what it does it's not a new well it is a new creation Paul says but it's really the recapitulation of a fallen creation towards the kingdom of God when all things will be made whole and it begins in the soul and and here you know there's the same Maximus the Confessor right man as the center of the cosmos but that's what I discovered and and so so you know the first issue is always pornography self-abuse the sexual stuff we're a sex obsessed Society but I I see that in in a materialist World okay in philosophically okay and coming out of materialism back into symbolism really you talk about this a lot you know in a materials world all you have is sex it's the only material point of transcendence because the sexual desire is a unit of Desire ultimately in the body it brings together Body Soul and mind right it's a beautiful gift from God but tremendously misused in our day and age but if a person is looking for Transcendence but they're they're they're locked in the shackles of materialism right then the only way you can go the only way you can find Transcendence is is through sexuality and that really messes people up because it's such a powerful thing so it's the reordering of that it's really the reording of that and one of the reasons I have success here with people getting out of pornography and all the attendant behaviors is is an Insight I received and it was from Saint Maximus the Confessor that that the foundation of all desire is a desire for God and so the healing from these these these maladies or their their personal maladies but they're in a sense you know culturally determined because of the way our culture is um is really to redirect the desire to redirect to the desire what's missing here I'll tell you what's missing here is that the the man's native and I'm talking about men men a man's native desire to create is actually subverting of the sexual desire which itself is a sexual desire they get all mixed up together and the man becomes defeated and here here the beauty of of Orthodox aesthetical discipline separate that right and direct that creative desire into productive work right and the gratification that he's seeking through through self-abuse and behaviors like that is actually met by Honest work with his hands right and that's once a man experiences that then he is on on the path to Healing which is to say you know the the the the the vivification of the proper ordering and structure of his soul I got way ahead on my question but that's what I do no that's correct father so maybe let's start let me let's start with because I think one of the difficulties that we that men have had especially is that there's been a displacement about what it is to be a man in many directions so we have you know we have the images of the the sports star or the action hero that type of image is there but then we also have the image of the of the feminized man or the you know the man who who who basically uh denies his own masculinity what do you think like how would you describe what it is to be a Christian man what how does Christianity preserve transform what image of masculinity does it present well I I you know we have models in the lives of the Saints okay and you see really different personality types in the lives of the Saints but I would say that that fundamentally and this is a little abstract it's a little abstract but you know you help guys find us I mean fundamentally the definition of true masculinity is to to Define for yourself who you are and what your purpose in this world is now every man desires that some men sublimate it any man who is self-aware and and has some measure of self-honesty okay that's the central question that can only be answered in communion with our creator but how do we come in to communion with our our creator it's through Brotherhood it is through Brotherhood I mean every Everything of everything that God gives us is mediated it's mediated and it you know it's mediated through matter it is it is God's energy is not amorphous it doesn't fly around and we kind of catch it it's mediated to us with great specificity and most often through other people and it's it's uh you know the best counselors are the people who have gone through the things themselves and worked it out and then they give what they have received to to the younger man and so masculinity masculinity is is is is coming into self-knowledge again of who you are and who God created you to be so so it's self-knowledge but it's also purpose a man needs that it is um realized and actualized in communion with other men so true masculinity is is a man who is on his journey with God in a journey of self-discovery self-disciplined towards the work that God has called him to do whatever that work might be I tell the young guys they say the most exhilarating Journey you can you can go on is the Journey of self-discovery they really like that they really like that but what is the Christian walk you know it's the discovery of God but the discovery of God and then the discovery of ourselves so so that's what it is in the interior life exterior life it is the cultivation of virtue which means to protect and provide that's what it means hmm and how do you see this let's say the relationship of the of masculinity with the feminine in the in in the church or in society how do you see those things being related to each other I believe that there's a fundamental structure in in in creation and um you know I went to Denmark as you know very very secular country all of Northern Europe is and um and my takeaway my personal takeaway I gave a lot and I received a lot and one of the things that I I received and I'm going to start speaking on this more clearly is that uh assert that the world is patriarchal just assert it okay and and because what I was doing is when I talked about patriarchy I always had the arguments of the detractors in the back of my mind and I would tailor what I said to answer the arguments the attractions and I came away saying no no no no no no don't do that the world is structurally patriarchal because God is father and so that means that that male and female have their own unique contributions they do but there is an ordering to this and the ordering is this and I can feel it inside me right there's always that tendency to self-center because you know what the culture is thinking and how they're going to react but that men have to be men so women can be women mm-hmm and that's a difficult thing to say because a lot of women will object to that but the the nature of their objection is is is one that is caused by by the collapse of masculinity in the broader culture I think if men become men then women will find their way as well so so the relationship is the relationship is and this goes deep and I can't say I understand it all but I think about it a lot but you know out of the Prospero which is the theotokos it's the matter it's the material Right comes the lamb who is Christ in the Chalice it's the body and blood of Christ but the body and blood come from the theodos all right so there's a complementarity and and and a deep deep interdependence between male and female in all of the creation really is but to to to think about these things that's as far as I'm going to go because the rest of what I have is just speculation I'm not really ready to talk about it but but to except for this point to think of these questions outside of of political categories and cultural polemics is very difficult it's very difficult we have to recover something that we have lost we have to recover something that we have lost male and female in the in the creation has to do with matter and meaning it does you need both you need matter to reveal the meaning you meet you need meaning to give matter its purpose and so it it it it it can fulfill its to tidy illogical aim right and and it's wrapped up in that somehow Jonathan but I'm waiting for you to work on it I think that you've got the basics right you know there's a sense in which the for sure in the church the the the the first thing to understand is that of course human beings are not just their their gender you know there's an aspect in which we can we can go beyond like what is it I mean the notion that Christ says that you know in Christ there is no male female like that is absolutely true but there's also an aspect to which we are gendered and in the respect that we are gendered then we do manifest certain realities in the world so it's important first of all it's important to make that distinction because sometimes when we talk about men and women people can think we're just reducing it to human beings to their gender it's like no we're not but we're also not pretending as if that's not a way in which the world is laying itself out and the way in which the world is is it's a filling filling the world with his glory is through this this beautiful relationship between male and female and so you're right the the the feminine is the one let's talk about Max and feminine in general mostly because then it's not just about human beings and their gender but the feminine is this space and that's why the theotokos is is presented to us as in all those images you know the ark the temple all the the images of that which sustained from below that holds or that gives body the mountain the latter you know everything that supports and then then the the male the masculine let's say manifests itself as the seed as the meaning as the you know the the top of the mountain at the place where things Heaven and Earth kind of come together and so you see that all through the all through the imagery that is that is there in the Old Testament and in the New Testament so I had the relationship between head and body and in some ways let's say in spiritually we are all we are all feminine in relationship to God like we are all called to become the bride of Christ and that that doesn't that doesn't so at that level there's no issue like it doesn't bother me to think that I'm the bride of Christ but I also have this other this aspect of myself which is gendered in the world and in that aspect I am I am I am masculine I'm a man and I have to play the role that that that uh that entails which is as Christ says you know to the idea of the the head of the family that type of imagery which is this reflection of the role that Christ plays in regards to the church so these are the things that are very culturally they're very difficult for people to understand but that's that's the way with in which the the pattern kind of it's a I I use the word fractal a lot where it it's it happens at every level of reality and in in yourself you also have that relationship you could say there's an aspect of you like the the your body has a certain aspect which is more feminine and there's an aspect of you the meaning making part which is more masculine and those relationships happen even within yourself you know it's it's a there's a let's say there's a part of you that the part of you which is which sustains the meaning which is which is equivalent to let's say the the feminine in in every other way let's say yeah well it's it's real interesting I see that's my answer because I get asked well why do we have female priests I think that's where the answer lies because if you have a female priest you have a symbolic collapse because in the Chalice you have the body and by the blood of Christ in the female body you have the creative prowess of creation of New Life men don't create like from their bodies women do yeah okay so if a woman is holding the Chalice right and the Chalice contains the body and blood of Christ but the body and blood come from the theotokos because it's a theotokos who gave the logos his human nature and makes salvation possible on that level right a male especially would look at would look at the woman and the chalice and I think you have a collapse you have a collapse of meaning right and the distinction between what we're trying to Define here between and the the material world and and and the world of meaning all right it collapses and so a male priesthood actually is a preventative against that kind of a collapse it holds together the distinctives the binary distinctives okay that are necessary within the very within the operation of the world within the operation of of society and um remove that and what happens and we see that we're getting into cultural polemics here a little bit but we see that in the churches that have adopted a female priesthood within 10 years they're into all sorts of sexual confusion yeah no but I think it's important to mention because you know 20 years ago 30 years ago 50 years ago we only had the promise where people were saying oh we need we need equality we just need this to happen female priests it's the future you know it's it's the the further Revelation it's the further feeling of the holy spirit all these arguments that they had and so it's like okay some Churches did it but now we have the fruit so let's look at the fruits so so for we can see what the fruits are and we can see the churches that have done that what happens to the to the church itself how it how it how it falls into confusion falls into revolutionary thinking it has this this type of of a of of a revolutionary approach to reality itself up to the point where the bishop here of the Anglican Church she she was the first female bishop and she'd made a speech where she says you know I'm paraphrasing but she says something like now is the time for us to reach up and grasp Divinity for ourselves and you're thinking Eve no not again yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah the quit is happening like it just doesn't take long before the the pattern sets itself up again really fast it's yeah yeah yeah and I understand that you know that revolutionary thinking is inevitable you know what it is it's just the desacralization of Christian cultural categories that's really what it is I get can't go any other way remove Christ from it right the categories still remain at least in Chris Christendom or the memory of the categories let's put it that way right that's the period we're in right now so it can only go revolutionary but this is a kind of a revolutionary myself but I think in a good way I think the most I've been telling people this the last few weeks especially I said you know we're really going to have to get to a point where we rebuild culture that's what's going to happen this is probably going to have to play out these things do and then they die of spiritual exhaustion the problem is I don't say that lightly because there's a lot of Carnage along the way there really is I mean and the suffering the suffering is real two points on that but what I want to say is that I think I've already started it right by by bringing restoration to these young men and and I'm starting it now it's much more important than kind of winning the culture wars yeah start rebuilding culture now because that's what's going to be needed in 10 or 15 years do it now and that's what part of this work is and then my second point I forgot Jonathan but it'll come back to me but you're but I think that that's the right approach because there's a sense in which the darker things get the more light will shine brightly and so you know if if you have men who are examples of loving positive self-sacrificial masculinity with authority though you know not just that we have the sense that self-sacrifice and and love just means being weak that's not what it means that's not what it meant in the case of Christ who is constantly you know reproaching his I mean Christ is not a soft figure but he's not constantly you know like snapping back at his disciples but he was willing to die for them and die for for for all those around him so this is what I this is what I tell my Protestant catech humans you know what I'll I'll ask him well why did why did Christ die and on the cross and they'll they'll they'll tell me Well to forgive us of our sins I said well wait a second there was forgiveness of sins before Christ came there was even baptism before Christ came the baptism of John was for the remission of sins so why did he really come and they're stumped and I say he came to conquer the devil we call him the Conqueror right and it removes kind of this this this feminized gloss that is over American Civil religion right removes and look at him and realize that the crucifixion on the cross was a voluntary self-sacrifice for what reason to free us from the tyranny of the devil and I contend that what I call the Matrix behind it is demonic power and the Demonic power is to to Blind Men to their own manhood and their masculinity so go going back to pornography in particular I I believe it comes from the depth of hell to to to to destroy the characters of young men before they can become before they realize who they are and what they can become right so there's a spiritual warfare to this now what what what ties it in and this is the point I forgot is that you said when darkness increases the light is greater that is so true I see the grace of God so powerful especially in the lives of these young men and when they need encouragement I tell them because it's true and I see it over and over again no one desires their healing more than God God is on their side um they've never heard that they don't believe it they're beat down but it's objectively true the grace that flows to help them overcome and to help them to be stronger is so consistent and it's so strong that I just know it's coming say the prayer it's coming I believe that that this path and this work is is directed ultimately by our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and it's absolutely necessary that it gets done so consequently part of the reason too for the Brotherhood is that I want to build resources to get to other priests that's what I want to do because a lot of priests now you mentioned it at the beginning where you know the churches are just being are filled up with catech humans well they're they're being filled up primarily with the young men that's right my contention by the way with the woman questions when the guys get themselves together the women will follow that's my prediction right but we don't know what to do you know I've spent the last 10 years doing it a little longer than that so I've learned a few things but I'd like to pass this knowledge along because they're because it's new it's something new and we we have to learn how to do it and that's another reason for the Brotherhood you know Jonathan um it's different this time around because you know when I first became a priest was like 20 20 years ago 25 years ago um you know it was basically um my catechism was okay what was your religious tradition and then you kind of tailored the catechism to that to show them where Orthodoxy was different I I call it now you know Orthodoxy and 10 easy lessons basically it was that but but my catechism changed once I started dealing with these guys and was basically how to walk how to find Christ and how to walk with them and the history and all that came later the theology was fleshed out through their own direct experience with him and the inner transformation that they experienced it's much more I would say the catechism is much more existential experiential that type of thing not so much here but a lot here because these guys and this is the difference who come into the church now they come in out of out of their pain it's their pain that that compels them to look upward and then they start going on YouTube and they find you and they find all this Orthodox stuff right and that's what brings them into the Orthodox Church yeah and they come in specifically for healing and so how are you going to scale what you're doing I guess because now it's mostly you being like a mentor you know kind of father to these young men and so how do you see this scaling in terms of having these brotherhoods in other places well I'm not building a a an organization top down and really broad okay basically what I'm doing is is doing virtually what I hope to see done in real time and locally so we're getting information out there we're learning as we go we're going to start classes where where guys sign up for and they're going to have to pay for it okay you're gonna have some skin in the game all right and and where there are certain areas in their life they want to improve on this and that we'll have classes on it accountability groups so you know maybe 10 guys and they hold each other to account right we'll build that out and all this information that we have that we're just going to give it away if a priest wants to do this in a local church fine if a bun if guys want to get together and do it on themselves fine okay it's too it's to generate a movement for the creation of brotherhoods because guys crave Brotherhood they crave the love of a brother that's how we're going to scale it out yeah I mean it's a it's a great idea because that used to exist I mean it it's so funny because it used to exist where they were these groups clubs mail-only type organizations where men uh were together by themselves in in groups and would just have this bonding and it's funny because those all those groups were attacked systematically by the feminists non-stop for Gen for like decades and decades you know saying that it's sexist and you should have women in these groups and they all succeeded so all the groups are gone and now it's super interesting because now you go to a gym and there's the women's only section or now you go to it you go to this thing you have women only clubs and you're thinking what what what happens wait wait a minute how did this how did this happen you know like you're realizing that it's important to have spaces in which women only can interact with each other so yeah we need those for men too now they're all destroyed so yeah so thank God for something like what you're doing because yeah we're going to rebuild it that's what we're going to do and I see it in the lives of men you know I you know I go and speak and and one of my my conditions is no women now it's not that this is a secret society these these these talks get recorded they're public right but I've got to speak only to men because when if there's a woman there it changes it changes everything yeah and I have to think it's the same with women yeah right yeah it's not it's not it's not it's a it's not wrong that it changes that it should change it but it also means that some subjects or some Dynamics are not possible as soon as the genders are mixed and some you know it's like if you have men and women in the same space and it will create a certain type of dynamic which which can which is just neutral it's neither good nor bad it depends what you want but some things that you would want to have only men because you want to you want to foster a certain type of of dynamic a relationship or pattern of of interrelationship that you can't have if there's a woman there and and women now the feminists are going to draw and quarter me for this but they're wrong and what I'm saying is Right women I just have to declare it I have to I have to stop being apologetic about it okay women want strong men feminine women they want their women to be feminine they want their women to be women and men and women want their men to be men okay let's just say it all right and there's this this collapse of of the sexist into kind of this this this uniform um totalitarian egalitarianism because that's what it becomes right that's just horrible it's death to the soul it's death to the soul yeah but what's interesting actually father it's not as it's even more complex than what you're saying because because the desire for women the desire that men have for women to be feminine the desire for for women that women want men to be masculine because there's this totalitarian egalitarian you know Fusion of everything it also creates strange parasitic extreme male figures and so what you end up having is you have a weird parasitic version of of hyper masculinity which becomes popular and things like gangster rap or you know 50 Shades of Gray all these images yeah of hyper masculine violent you know dangerous men become idealists and then you have these insane kind of horror you know Pros almost like prostitute images of of hyper feminine uh you know broken down images and they become extremely popular so on the one hand you have this idea that we ought to be the same and we ought to be exactly the same and then you have these these figures that look like like caricature of a caricature of a caricature of what a man and a woman is yeah it becomes freakish the distortions become freakish because if everything is is is is melded together it's the only thing that you can see yeah it's the only indication of of Distinction left which still conversely affirms that those that that the fundamental distinction the binary is true because how else could you see it if your soul wasn't longing for that that that particular distinction it goes back to the structure of things again and there's a matter in which you know Christianity for example will mediate and will let's say tame the extreme desire for the extremes let's say and we'll bring it into something that is purposeful but as soon as you if you take that away then it's not as if those opposites go away it's that they become they become like you said they become insane they become insane caricatures that are ridiculous yes it becomes freakish yeah freakish it's a great deal I mean this is this is how when you try and understand how is it that people get caught up in these perversions that's how it's really Distortion if we can see human ontology in the way that same Maximus the the uh Confessor describes it which is kind of a repudiation that man is innately evil and the whole kind of calvinistic anthropology that swept through the west and it's still largely there I think that those cultural that those ideas formed in some of these cultural presuppositions that bring us in that freakish direction if you can see it in the way in human anthropology like in the Orthodox understanding in in particularly same Maximus a Confessor you can also begin to understand how the this freakishness emerge emerges and how people get caught up in these vices there's there's a certain there's a certain logic to it you know it's it's the logic of distortion let's call it that yeah it's and it's it's we we tend I use the word parasitic I like that John traviki has that word parasitic a parasitic process which is the idea that it's a desire that's good in itself but when it gets disconnected from its true purpose it starts to turn on itself you know out of Pride out of this self looking back at itself and so it becomes a caricature exactly it becomes a kind of freakish version of what the the what it what's what's actually making it exist which is a good that it's supposed to be aligned to and so then it all becomes these weird kind of yeah freakish caricatures and I always see the benevolence of God in there and the I really do um because I'm confronted sometimes with things so that people have done or what they're they're entrapped in right a vice vice is really real and a vice can can really hold a grip over a person's soul but that can be broken the vice can be broken and the Soul can be healed because and this is the remarkable thing it's just it just really is it gives me so much hope because God is good because God seeks to pray and heal the person they're synonymous freedom and healing are synonymous right now that even a person caught up in something like that and can't find his way out can find his way out through Christ and be restored to what is natural be restored to what is natural that's Orthodoxy it's just
