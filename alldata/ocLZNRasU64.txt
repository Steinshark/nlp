hello everyone in this short series we're going to be creating a simple character based on the following design it's essentially one of those wooden artists mannequins and I think it's a nice design to start with because all of the different parts of the body are sort of neatly separated by these joints which greatly simplifies the modeling and rigging process so following this episode will be the modeling episode in which we'll create something like what you see on screen next we'll rig that so we were easily able to pose the character and then we'll animate a simple walk cycle and maybe a few other actions to go along with it finally for those of you who may be interested in the game development side of things we'll also be importing the character and animations into unity and setting it up with the Mechelen system now for the rest of this episode I'd like to quickly go over some of the basics in blender and I could try and be at all comprehensive here because most of the stuff you really go to pick up pretty quickly just by watching the series primarily I want to touch on a few things regarding changing views and the object and edit modes so if that's all I'll tattoo you then I welcome you to skip ahead to the next episode those of you remaining with me however we have a new blender file here and I just like to draw your attention to the top left where we have the words user perspective now the user part of this refers to the fact that we're viewing the scene from some random rotation you can rotate around the scene by the way just by middle-mouse dragging and then you can just move around by shift middle Mouse dragging so if we want to view the scene from a specific rotation we can go into the View menu you can choose to view it from left right back front bottom or top so I press write for example this is just go to snap to the right view as shown in the top left chair now perspective as you are all aware is just an effect where things in the distance appear much smaller now often when we're working it can be helpful to view our scene without any perspective in which case we can just go into the View menu and toggle into orthographic mode and now things in the distance appear as if they were right front of us changing views and switching between perspective and orthographic mode is something one tends to do quite a lot so it's a very good idea to memorize the shortcuts for these say for example going into right view is just three on the numpad now to clear up some potential confusion the numpad refers to the number keys on the right side of the keyboard and not the top row of numbers now if you're like me in that you don't have an unpaired then fret not all we need to do is go into the user preferences and then in the input panel over here we just want to make sure that emulate numpad is turned on and then you'll probably want to save user settings so that that will be the same every time you load blender all right now I'm quickly to delete this cube just by pressing X and delete you can see we filled this little circle in the center of our scene which is our 3d cursor which we can place anywhere in the scene just by clicking and when we add a new object the object will be added at the 3d cursor so if I now press shift a to bring up the add menu I can add in a cube object over there and when we're in object mode which you can see we are in at the moment down here we are working with the entire object at a time so if I want to move this object I can press G to move it around or to rotate it s to scale it and we can also constrain all of these transformations to a single axis so for example if I want to only scale on the x axis then I press s followed by X and can now scale it just on the x axis also it's useful to know that you can enter the values numerically so if I press s X and then five for example that will scale it to five units and I can just press ENTER to confirm the transformation now if we actually want to start manipulating this shape we can then go into edit mode you can switch between edit and object mode with tab by the way so now you can see we and actually start manipulating the individual vertices or if we go down here we can change to edge mode or face mode and here in edit mode as an object mode it is right-click to select now it's important to note that while we're in edit mode if I now press shift a and add in a new mesh it adds it in as part of this object whereas if I go out into object mode and now add in a new cube for example you can see these are two separate objects and I can go into edit mode on each of them but not at the same time now in this character that we're going to be creating we want the entire thing to be a single object so whenever we want to add in a new cube for example for a limb or perhaps a sphere for one of the joints we're going to do that in edit mode now if you inadvertently add the mesh in in object mode and you realize somewhere down the line that you've now got two separate objects you can join them together by selecting one then shift right clicking to select the other and then simply ctrl J will join these together into a single object all right so that's everything that I wanted to mention for this episode so until next time Cheers
