today i want to talk about money specifically how you can get better at managing your own money as a filmmaker so you can keep doing what you love for a long time to come [Music] as filmmakers we rely on our creativity to pay the rent and in my experience there is nothing worse for your creative output than being flat broke because let's face it the point of this job isn't to get rich but money can buy you the creative freedom you need to do your best work if you're totally broke you won't be able to invest in passion projects you definitely won't be able to afford new gear and the more stressed you are about next month's bills the less likely it is that you'll come up with your next great idea and more often than not being in good financial health is as much about how you manage your money as it is about how much money you make so in this video i'm gonna share five of the personal finance principles that i live by that have helped me not only stay in this crazy career for over 10 years but actually create a stable business that can support my life the last one in particular i only started about two years ago and it saved me almost 20 000 since then so this is stuff that actually works for me they're not just random ideas i pulled off the internet i know it's more fun to talk about actual filmmaking but if you can dial in your personal finances the creative part is gonna flow so much easier trust me so let's get into it [Music] hey guys welcome back and if you're new here my name is luke forsythe and on this channel i teach the skills i've learned over 10 years working as a documentary filmmaker and photographer if you're into that kind of thing make sure to hit that subscribe button because there's new videos coming every week okay before we really dive into this i just need to say that i'm obviously not a professional financial advisor and that everything i'm going to say in this video is just based on things that have worked for me if it worked for me i think it can probably work for you too but do your own research and make sure it makes sense before you start doing anything alright disclaimer over when i was first starting to get interested in traveling the world i made every financial mistake you can think of i maxed out my credit cards and then ignored the bills i spent my student loan money on a new laptop and i let my bank account balance get so low that i was eating plain spaghetti every night for weeks on end [Music] it took me years to dig my way out of that hole and the sad part is that if i just got my act together a little sooner i probably would have had a much easier time getting started as a photographer and filmmaker with better credit and a bit more savings i could have gotten started a whole year earlier time that i spent doing a job i didn't want to be doing just to get enough money together for a used camera and a plane ticket and even now that i've been in this business for over 10 years and have a lot more work coming in there are still some crazy ups and downs that i've only been able to weather because i stick to some pretty rigid personal finance habits some years will be good and some will be less good and some like 2020 and a lot of 2021 can be financially terrible but if you build some financial systems in your life you can get through them actually the first personal finance tip i give to any filmmaker is because of this type of unpredictability we're pretty much all freelancers in this business and when things go wrong it falls to you to figure it out there's no big company to step in when things break and a massive gear failure at the wrong time can be disastrous just last year i was in the middle of setting up a long interview for a big client when my fs7 shut itself off i tried everything i changed the batteries i plugged it into ac power ran it from v-mount batteries nothing worked sometimes it turned on for 30 seconds or so but eventually it would just shut down and there was nothing i could do obviously there's no way to shoot an interview with your camera turning off every 30 seconds so i was forced to shoot the whole thing on the b cam which meant that there was no second angles for editors to cut away to luckily the director was understanding and knew that it wasn't my fault but that didn't change the fact that i had another shoot coming up in a week and no a cam to shoot it on thank god i had set up a rainy day fund earlier that year and resisted all my urges to dip into it and with that i was able to buy a used camera to replace my broken one i'm guessing that most people know what this is but just in case a rainy day fund is a chunk of money that you set aside for emergencies and you don't touch unless you have to it's not an extension of your checking account that you start spending when your main account runs dry it's a totally separate fund that you should pretend doesn't exist unless it's an absolute crisis moment how much you put in is relative to what kinds of expenses you're likely to run into there's no magic number for everyone if you have low overheads and not a lot of gear your rainy day fund could be just a few hundred dollars if you run a busy production company and own a ton of gear it could be tens of thousands whatever that number is it should be enough to cover something big and unexpected i've had to use my rainy day fund twice in my life and both times i don't know what i would have done without it both times i've used it i've made it my number one financial priority to fill it back up again before investing in anything else related to filmmaking just knowing it's there gives you peace of mind to know your business won't collapse overnight and i'd say get one going for yourself before doing anything else surviving as a freelance filmmaker is all about protecting yourself from the ups and downs and the next thing i suggest is kind of like an extension to the rainy day fund that you work towards once that fund is in place i call it my three-month rule and it basically just means that i try to have at least three months of living expenses in a savings account before i'll allow myself to invest in any gear or other big filmmaking expenses so many times i've been going through a good patch where i'm working all the time and it can be really easy to think that things will just keep going like this forever then out of nowhere the calls will just dry up one day and you might not get another job for weeks or even months i read recently that something like 65 percent of americans are living paycheck to paycheck and that's a very risky place to be but as freelancers we don't even have the luxury of a regular paycheck so it's all going to be on you to make sure you can pay your bills even when the phone isn't ringing with three months of living expenses you don't have to panic when a dry spell hits and you might actually be able to enjoy the downtime i know banking up that kind of money is easier said than done but the key is to make it a priority that you work towards which means you don't buy that prime lens or motion control slider off facebook marketplace every time you have a little bit of extra cash get your three-month safety net in place and you're going to be able to get through the bad times and stay in the game which is the only real way to have a successful career at the end of the day but how can you possibly save up for both a rainy day fund and have three months of living expenses in the bank when you're just starting out in your career and the jobs aren't paying so well there's only one way that i know of and my third tip for you is a pretty simple one you have to lower your overheads what the only real way to save money is to spend less than you earn which sounds ridiculously simple and it is the best way to get to that point faster is to spend less there are so many ways to lower your overheads that you're gonna have to decide for yourself where you can trim the fat when i was just starting out i realized it was going to be really hard to live in downtown toronto as an aspiring photojournalist so i moved to phnom penh cambodia where the living expenses were much much lower now that's a pretty extreme decision for most people i know but it did work and moving can be a good option but maybe you're happy where you are and don't want to leave the country and i totally get that but maybe you can find a cheaper apartment or move to a less expensive neighborhood or move in with roommates or maybe your rent is already as low as you can get it in your city there are a lot of other ways to save take the bus or ride your bike instead of driving while gas is really expensive cook more and eat out less do you need four streaming services every month or is one or two enough go through your iphone subscriptions and cancel the memberships to those horoscope apps you forgot you signed up for or that magazine you never read anyways i don't know you and i don't know your life and only you can know for sure where you can cut back for me when covid started and work dried up i ended up downgrading my adobe plan giving up a secondary website i didn't use that much cancelling a membership to a meal prep service and a bunch of other things that were nice but not necessary i didn't love doing it but between all these different things i think i cut out probably an extra 200 a month and that's real money and even though things are better now the interesting part is that i haven't started any of those things back up again they were just bloated side effects of lifestyle creep that i thought were important but didn't actually end up missing all that much it might take a while but you can slowly work down the amount of money you need to live every month you're going to be able to get by with fewer jobs build up that rainy day fund faster and get your three-month safety net quicker and then be ready to move on to the next step of the personal finance plan okay so you've got your rainy day fund in place you've cut back your overheads to only the things that really make an impact in your life and you're feeling safe with three months of living expenses in the bank the next step is to start thinking about investing any extra money you have so that you can build wealth over a long period of time like i said if you're interested in a career in documentary filmmaking you're probably going to be a freelancer which means no pension and no matching 401k payments that most people in more traditional careers might enjoy and while saving money is great once you have more than a few months of expenses in the bank keeping your money in cash is actually going to lose you money in the long run again i'm not a financial advisor here and do your own research but typically cash doesn't keep pace with inflation in the long term so the money you save today is actually going to be worth less next year because everything you buy will cost more savings accounts even the ones called high interest don't usually keep up with the pace of inflation so hoarding all your savings in cash is not the best way to save for the long term and when i say long term i'm not talking about next year when you need a new drone or even three years when you might need to upgrade your current camera i'm talking about 30 or 40 years from now when you're ready to slow down a bit one of the best things about being a filmmaker is that you really never need to retire you can keep making documentaries for as long as you're still interested in the world and no one's going to tell you it's time to move on like they would at a law firm or doctor's office you can stay in this game for a very long time but most people are going to reach a point where they want to slow down a little bit when you don't really want to be on the road for 200 days a year and would like to spend a bit more time at home for that you're going to need money and the best way that i know of to turn your money into more money is by investing it and when i say investing i don't mean buying and selling stocks or trying to time the market for the next surge in bitcoin i'm talking about putting your money behind businesses that you think are going to succeed in the long run and then not touching it for decades i don't want to go too deep into the nitty-gritty of how to invest because there are a lot of other youtubers who can break down your options better than i can personally i invest in etfs which are funds with low management fees that track the overall health of different markets i own some that track the us market some for canada some for international and emerging markets and one that just tracks the top tech companies exclusively with this strategy you're basically just investing in the world economy in general and making the assumption that in the long term the world is going to be a richer place than it is now this stuff took me a long time to wrap my head around but one book in particular called the little book of common sense investing by john bogle made the most sense to me it's an easy read and you don't need to be an economic student to understand it and for me it just seemed like the right strategy i'll link to it in the description if you're interested but the key to this whole investing thing is the same as the key to successful filmmaking career be in it for the long haul you make money this way by investing early and waiting 30 years not by pulling your money out every two to three years for a new red camera i really wish i'd started this earlier but as they say the best time to plant a tree is yesterday and the second best time is right now the last thing i want to talk about today took me an embarrassingly long time to actually do and i only set this up two years ago even though i've been doing this job for over a decade and that's to formally register your business i did this in canada and i'm not really sure how it works everywhere else but registering yourself as the sole proprietor of a freelance production business opens up all sorts of tax options that can save you a ton of cash i'm not even talking about incorporating a business which can be expensive just applying for a business license and registering the name is enough in canada at least and i'm pretty sure a lot of other places too i think all the fees combined cost about 70 bucks and the forms took less than an hour to fill out online so it's not exactly a huge investment having a registered business name means that you can now harness the full potential of tax write-offs which has saved me almost twenty thousand dollars since i started doing it now when i buy a new piece of gear or go for a working lunch or fill up a tank of gas while out on a shoot take a picture of their seat and log in in a document using the app expensify as long as that expense is legitimately related to video production it's a write-off and that just basically means that when the government is calculating how much tax i owe every year they deduct a percentage of those expenses from my taxable income and the overall amount i owe is much less google how the write-off system works wherever you are but by simply registering my business and starting to take my write-off seriously i've saved enough money to buy a new fx9 in just two years it's worth the effort i promise alright there we go those are the five personal finance habits i stick to as a freelance documentary filmmaker if you have any other tips or tricks for me let me know in the comments because i'm always looking to level up my knowledge when it comes to this stuff hope you learned something from that and if you did think about
