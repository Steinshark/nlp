ladies and gentlemen welcome to the final epic chess event of 2023 frankly the final chess event of every single year which is the world Blitz Championship over 20 rounds of action between some of the world's best players played over two days it is an exhausting grueling format but the good news is it doesn't Just Produce Crazy Games it also produces crazy memes and today I have a handful for you as always it has been a very dramatic rapid in Blitz World Championship with people getting fines for their shoes and people tweeting stuff and personal lounges well I saw this incredible clip earlier today that I'm going to share with you right now as Magnus Carlson was slammed with a door I did not see this this clip belongs to chess with loesh uh who uploaded this first Magnus does like an Olympic jump over some rails which is like epic and then he's walking to his round and watch it this poor guy this poor guy he he opens the door for Magnus but he stops and he crashes into the door so first Magnus is late to his game so he turns the corner he has to jump cuz that thing is probably super long so he jumps over the thing nice we in good shape and just just the poor guy he he stops pulling the door and makes oh like this is incredible how does this tournament just constantly have memes and that's not the end of it that is not the end there there is so much more to unpack here we're going to get into all of it magn is grinding uh the world's best players are playing speed chess it is a huge amount of fun can Magnus win his 17 title will somebody spoil it if Anish giri wins the world Blitz Championship he actually makes it to the candidates because of the Fay circuit it's crazy stuff here we go I'm going to take you through a bunch of games I'm going to take you through controversy oh my goodness Magnus begins his world Blitz campaign against Serge Goran from Hungary uh this one starts with a Spanish nice and easy it's 3 minute chance with 2 seconds bonus time A6 Bishop A4 that's why they're getting a lot of time back Magnus plays a D3 C3 setup he does not play for C3 D4 he might but for now he's just defending a center Pawn B5 D6 and H6 played by black this is a very provocative line Bishop to G5 where frequently white wants black to play for G5 you want you know you want to play H6 and then you want to go for you want black to play G5 Bishop B6 Bishop E6 gregorian's kind of preparing himself but then he plays C and he actually spents a lot of time he's already down to 56 seconds I guess it's kind of the nerves of playing against Magnus the the the critical move here is G5 like it it is the best move and you try to basically punish white for having this goofy bishop and you try to attack but after Castle's castles and then you know King h8 it's kind of a very solid position but the guy has 40 seconds I mean when you have a one and a half minute time advantage in a three-minute game that's a lot of time Rook B8 Magnus maneuvering now gan's kind of indicating that does want to go G5 and then he reconsiders his life completely and plays G5 so gregan did not want to play G5 without castling instead he castled and played G5 but it's actually not that bad it's still kind of part of the nature of the position now what Magnus is going to try to do is exploit the squares and he's potentially going to play D4 if Magnus can land the move d4 at a certain moment he's going to be in really good shape the only reason you can't land D4 right away is because after Pawn takes Pawn takes you have this but then I'm going to chop the bishop you're going to and then I'll probably grab the pawn on e4 or the pawn on D4 frankly and I'm going to be okay like I'll play G4 grab the pawn on D4 so Magnus waits he plays Bishop C2 now he does put that Knight on D5 trying to take advantage of the squares but Gans is now down to 20 seconds that's a really difficult amount of time to play with and after D4 his position is in a very critical spot he plays e takes D4 Magnus here can play the Queen uh the mouse slip move Queen D3 because it looks like you meant Queen D4 even though that hangs a queen but Queen D3 threatens mate instead he does this and unfortunately under the pressure of the clock plays this and now it is white to play and win can you find the move that Magnus Carlson played in this position very good yes that's a free Knight no no no that's what you would play in this position the move is Bishop to F5 hitting the queen hitting the Knight and defended by the Knight that's not a knight that's a knight and uh Magnus wins a pretty smooth game one now the good the good thing is he started well the bad news is he has 11 more rounds to go cuz on day one they play 12 games which is crazy now I'm about to show you some of the craziest chest that you've ever seen in your life this might be the most insane Game of the Year and good timing cuz it's December 29th some of you might be watching this recap is December 30th this came right at the right moment shakar AR midar is like is like a trip on a substance when you play chess and Iden suan Le is H is the is the future of aarani Chess like these are two Aeries they're very very strong uh we have a trompowsky one of my favorite openings and this one gets Wild real quick cuz the center blows up he takes the pawn on C5 he plays E4 Bishop C5 and now the pawn pins the Knight to the queen it looks like white is winning actually already it's not so clear because Queen B6 you can't actually take the Knight because the bishop will take and then I'll take on G1 and your King's going to have to step out in front of the pieces which is why in this position shakar mamar took on F6 allowing Bishop takes F2 check hitting the Knight and the king and the king would have to step forward and in the way of all the pieces what the heck is going on King to E2 Queen E3 looks like mate it's not because of the bishop otherwise that would be game over in eight moves instead of that we have Bishop takes G1 Bishop G1 and now Queen F2 is possible White's King is blocking all of his pieces what is happening here now you would think FG is a good move but then I'll play Queen F2 and queen D4 and then here and you you you just don't get anything which is why in this position shakar mov sacrifices The Rook what this dude just took the best Bishop he's taking the bishop to remove any danger to his King because the queen can only do damage to the king with the bishop there now Black's Queen has to waste time entering the white position while White's King is actually pretty well protected and here comes Knight to oh my goodness Knight to I mean I would understand Knight F3 and then the Queen's got to go back to C5 and then we no Knight E4 the idea of Knight E four is to jump into the black position but also if you take FG is a threat on the rook and mate it's game over you just lose it is game over Knight to E4 another brilliancy but the position remains in the balance now Iden plays Rook G8 spends 40 seconds so mamar takes on G7 the Knight still cannot be taken the bishop has opened up Knight F6 is just a walk into the black position Iden still defending himself correctly Rook takes G7 now midara plays a crazy move he doesn't play Knight F6 he doesn't play Knight D6 he doesn't play Bishop B3 he doesn't play Bishop F6 he plays Queen to D2 and apparently this is some sort of either magical Bluff or still something he remembers there are now discovered threats on the queen but the bishop can't even move and the other idea is Queen C3 which is a fork on the rook and the bishop H6 Queen C3 hitting the Rook the queen gets into the black position it's ravaging the the the black queen is snuggled in the corner Knight C6 Iden has to break out but that's the wrong move he had to play Queen H2 Queen B7 check Knight D7 and get his Queen back quickly but instead of that he does this and he tries to attack the white king with his Knight but it's King E3 and white is completely winning two-minute time advantage two and a half up on the clock he doesn't want to draw so he goes to D3 and he loses all the advantage the winning idea apparently was King E1 walking into a fork then King E2 and then in this position you play King D3 you have to lose the pawn some of you might be wondering why that's even possible why would the Knight not take the Rook well Queen f8 wins The Rook back too much way too dank as the kids say simply way too dank the major difference being that apparently now if you play King D3 the C Pawn is standing and The Rook doesn't actually get to go to C1 I guess if the C Pawn wasn't there the Rook would go to C1 and there would be mating threats but that doesn't exist anymore so the position is back to equal Queen F5 there was a moment there that black might have been winning the game despite having 10 seconds on the clock wh's King is triumphantly marching around the board D4 that's it oh my God where did his Rook go but he's still completely winning he's still completely winning because Black's King is simply too weak oh my God Black's King is safe oh my God black king is safe what is happening in this position why are the Kings out in front of all the pieces white plays Queen E5 and just starts pushing his Pawns midar of decides you know what chess is a very easy game sometimes cocoon your king with all the pieces and just make sure the pawns go up the board look at how safe the king is Bishop A4 he's just looking for a way to push the bonds it's a Scramble with 10 seconds left on the clock A6 A7 and he's winning he's winning because the pawn is simply going to promote Black's pawns are too slow oh my goodness black plays Queen G4 allows promotion but there was nothing you could do you play something you can't even get back Queen E4 to got try to go here I have Bishop F7 the king comes forward I have Queen F2 I'm just going to hunt the king down and mate you also this obviously oh my God what a game what a completely insane position both Kings going on spiritual Journeys oh myar of wins that was part of a a four game winning streak for him now Fabiano Carana versus h nean this is a big game Fabiano's had a lot of success versus Hans recently Hans sticking to his true and tried Berlin Fabiano saying no Berlin for you Bishop C5 can Hans snap the streak beating Fabiano in Blitz which might be his best format to beat him in because fabi's a monster and classical and his rapid is no joke either A5 castles castles Knight E2 take takes very solid position black has as a Berlin Pawn structure over there on the left side of the board the Queen side A4 F4 Fabby going for it it takes activates his Rook Hans still trying to do some stuff on the queen side C5 here comes the Rooks Hans puts his Knight on the center H3 Bishop E6 repositioning very tense game but h a minute down fobby plays Knight F3 and Knight F4 both horses are go look at this Connect Four on the f file you know something is cooking up over there Hans plays rookie Rook d8 Fab's playing very quickly and very confidently now Hans is left with a pawn here and a pawn here could be some weaknesses could be some light Square infiltration Knight D2 Hans again commits upon PA very very aggressive play Fabby play Z5 taking squares away from Hans clearing up the E4 Square for for a potential piece there it is take take H is now at 14 seconds on the clock that's simply not enough time he's trying to defend himself Queen C1 in fact he has a better position but he's only got 10 seconds to do something with it he plays C4 he's opening up the board he grabs the B on C2 he's really close to winning because if he can clear out this Pawn he's just going to get a totally winning position King H2 Knight D4 Fabby 19 seconds on the clock Hans 5 seconds on the clock gets two seconds every time he makes a move oh my goodness B3 and he's going to win critical moment in the game Knight to F5 Queen G6 someone's going to either B3 or hans's King is going to get checkmated Hans tries to play defense Bobby goes back Hans is winning Queen C7 he doesn't see it King h8 9 D6 Queen D7 a rep no no repetition we trade Queen oh but fabbi snuck over and got to the pawns Rook F3 Queen D5 Hans grabs on A2 Rook A3 Queen E2 Queen E7 What's Happening Here both guys in oh it was equal Hans saw Rook D5 Rook A8 Queen E8 but what he missed was this and now the king walks into a check the back rank is cleared and Hans was dead even with five it was a very back and fourth game where everything was falling off the board he just had to stay on the back rank very unpleasant position though obviously it looks like like white has a very powerful Pawn but the queen is powerful as well but Hans demon blunders Queen f8 and resigns because it's just game over you just get mated once the white Rook infiltrates a very very crazy game back and forth Fabby continues the good streak against Hans Hans had a had a decent first day uh women side Anastasia bodnaruk the winner of the World rapid Championship on the women's side Valentina gunina one of the most combative Grand Masters on the planet she never makes draws I think Valentina played an entire rapid championship and an entire Blitz Championship day one and she has made no draws so bodnaruk uh versus G this is like a first place matchup it's an E5 C5 caroan gy obviously a big fan of my recommendation of the caroan defense I don't think she's learning from it if anything she should be teaching me but CD CD 97 black gets a vintage carocon position exactly what you want white however is trying to pick at the Knight white gets this structure with potential attacking possibilities if black castles G says come get some you want to you want to Checkmate me I'm going to be checkmating you first the bishop on G5 opposite color Bishops favor the attacking player Queen D2 Queen B6 King slides out of the way to H1 Rook C1 Rook C Rook C8 Rook C1 white takes a lot of space position looks good for white very pleasant But Here Comes Gina gunina is a fighter she is a brawler she's always looking to scrap on the board and she's going to open up the position here Bodner ruk tries to play Knight to A4 infiltrating the dark squares gu says you could have the whole Queen side take take the whole side of the board with you I'm looking for checkmate Knight C5 nice idea Rook F2 this is what Robert hes likes to refer to as a collinear move because that makes him sound very intelligent Rook to F2 is a move when you are staring at a piece on a straightaway or on a diagonal and instead of taking it you make a move on that same straightaway and you basically say take me you want it so bad take me so I get in on the Square that I'd like to be on so she does and then she brings the Knight back to kick the Rook out it's a very tense position but you know gy always looking for a fight E5 always looking to attack always looking to create complications takes takes and guina blunders a fork wait a minute she blunders a fork but she grabs the pawn on E3 so her Rook is hanging but she's hitting the queen and after this this The Rook is hanging here and the pawns fall apart now here White's best move is Queen D5 check and she plays it but you still can't take the Rook because your own Rook is hanging so in this position you can play Rook D1 Rook F1 but look at G has built nearly a one minute time Advantage which as we know in Blitz is very stressful Rook C2 is played Black plays rook d8 and now it's really White's king that's weak because White's King is completely stranded white continues to try to attack but you do not attack gu you you can't just be attacking G like that what are you nuts now White's King has no legal moves white goes here still looking to create Checkmate threats but unfortunately white gets M at first Rook to D1 mate you might be sitting there going no it's not Bishop takes yeah but then Queen E1 sacrificing The Rook clear out the defense and the white king is absolutely smothered in the corner a beautiful kind of configuration there Valentina gunina is destroying the event right now she is on fire I will show you the standings in a bit buner Rook having a great event as well she's very much in the fight for medal she she might a double medalist which is awesome I will show you the standings uh some more games that I have for you Carlson subani was a crazy crazy crazy game um B3 is what Magnus chose in this one he did not want to play another E4 E5 he was not looking for a Spanish instead he played just a very simple nimol Larson B3 E3 Knight F3 Bishop B2 very solid Bishop B5 personally when I'm playing Black here I like to play A6 I don't want to allow my opponent to put the bishop there Magnus does that Bishop is ready to die there it goes it it is in fact going to perish and now a big question will Magnus play Knight E5 F4 will he play D4 will he play D3 and Knight D2 and try to play for E4 what's he going to do there are many setups Magnus plays Knight E5 and D3 so he's not yet playing F4 but there it is that this is the Vintage B3 setup you give up your light squared Bishop you create a very nice scale of central pawns like this and then you play F4 very nice position and you can either choose to attack with your Knights you can choose to attack with your G Pawn you can do whatever you like he also could just take the bishop so it never pressures your king put the Knight like this because in a perfect world black plays B5 and gets the bishop out of the way that's really what black would love to do so castles Magnus is going for it he is attacking the young man from India Barat is a very very strong Grand Master and Here Comes Here Comes D4 I told you about this move Magnus grabs this and locks the center so the center is locked his Bishop is dead until he goes C3 or until he trades or until he zigzags but he does have a space ADV advantage and you could try to attack your opponent but barath is not going to none of these young guys are really that int they might be secretly intimidated by Magnus but they don't play like it really like B5 Magnus plays A4 but best move E5 fighting back in the center saying Magnus do something with your Pawn if you want to take I'll play Knight G4 I'll get the pawn back I'll also put my knight there right if you play E5 and F5 I'm going to do the same thing and actually my Rook is faster so E5 is a really nice move Magnus plays Bishop C1 and Knight D7 it's a it's a big battle Knight F1 look at but C4 knocking on magnus's door he says you want to go attack my king Magnus I'm going to attack you on this side this was anything but a walk in the park this day one for Magnus constantly under attack by the young guys takes takes opening the position takes takes he doesn't take again he plays Knight G3 G6 Knight back to E2 he induced a move by his opponent now here comes F5 the attack is continuing but barath Triple B 19 points of material barreling down on the C file look at this is Magnus going to strike when the iron is hot he plays Bishop D2 but barath is is stopping the attack now Magnus has to retreat oh this is really bad sign this is a really bad sign he's bringing his Knight but I'm not sure he has any sort of attack can he make something happen he takes on G6 Queen F3 o nice idea sacrificing the bishop to take on F7 black plays Queen B3 he protect he attack Bishop H6 the queen goes back there's no attack here but Magnus does have a one minute time Advantage he's playing H3 these are kind of stalling moves King H1 he's trying to get his opponent to potentially Panic Rook A2 but he's not panicking even with 5 Seconds on the clock he's defending himself very well Bishop D2 here Magnus finds the nice idea of Bishop B4 he doesn't have an advantage though Bishop B4 was given a brilliant move I'm not so sure about that you can't take cuz Queen F7 take take it's still equal Knight G1 he's repositioning Magnus is doing by the way credit to the World Champ he doesn't need me to give credit but credit to the World Champ he's doing a really nice job here and here's something really tragic happens with 5 Seconds on the clock Barat subramaniam saw Knight to G5 coming and he also saw Knight E5 and he touched his F Pawn he touched his F Pawn because the only way to protect is to go here and here unfortunately touch move and chest means you have to you have to move a piece if you can and that is a fatal blunder you don't just lose a pawn you lose all your king safety and it's over Knight to H7 Rook to F6 Knight E6 all threats and Magnus Carlson wins a very tense game I mean you got to give credit to Magnus who put pressure for a while and even there you know this is a very tough position because you can stop Knight G5 but you're going to be a pawn down in an end game against Magnus in the long run you probably lose this but yeah he touched this pawn and and he made a very fatal mistake he did not go up PA down against Magnus he uh he lost the game on the spot but man I mean these young guys in particular from India but from usbekistan from Kazakhstan they are monsters they are so so good I have another crazy game for you and then we will cover the controversy of the day we're going to cover the controversy of the day so prag nand versus danil dubov danil has been a killer in the blitz but Prague is one of the best overall players in the world Bishop E7 danil really likes this line he doesn't put the bishop out on C5 Bishop E7 D6 and every time I cover a dubov game after you watch this video I I always advertise go look up dubov calisthetics this man can do one arm pull-ups if anybody chess boox the Neil dubov they would die C3 Knight A5 Bishop wraps around very very standard stuff you know your typical Italian Spanish that 99% of us don't understand and all the top Grand Masters in the world do typical maneuvering white looking for either D4 or A4 or the legendary F5 Square black looking for potential break there's D4 so now black has to adjust to that we have take take Knight plants itself on E5 either ready to go this way or jump forward into the position over here Knight df5 white gets to that very nice F5 score I really like White's position here but denil is also very elusive very creative player plays A5 a B4 locks down the queen side again you make me choose I really think white has much more potent attacking chances here but the position's in the balance I mean nobody's better Rook C7 Rook D7 he's defending himself prag makes a a waiting move prag spends a minute prog spent a minute calculating this this this this this this this this like all this and he moved this that's a bad sign that's a bad sign when you spend a minute you will remember in the game that I just showed you Magnus also played a waiting move in this position he played King H1 in like six seconds so sometimes you don't know what to do it's best to just tuck the king away black tucks his King away and he doesn't even spend any time P plays F3 oh no from 126 to 12 seconds prog freezes he freezes cuz he's like I think I have something but I can't see anything how is it possible now he is on the back foot now dubov starts activating his pieces and and and this is very common for humans you want to trade three he made that move one second on the clock he gets two second B look at this move very nervy move he wants something to happen Rook E5 keeping the tension he's trying to trade pieces Prague he's trying to trade the pieces to make a draw because he doesn't have a lot of time yeah dubov doesn't play those games here comes the Neil one arm pull up dubov and it's real bad look at how all the piece Dub's position just moved like a wooden puzzle every single piece in Dub's position just shifted a little bit and look how effectively they are sniping the white position I mean this is crazy the position is still in the balance until this move and in this position denil dubov uncorks pure savagery against the legendary Indian prodigy prananda dubov sacrifices The Rook Rook takes F3 prying the defenses open he takes a pawn with check King to G1 and now you can't just keep feasting cuz the queen will get involved in defense so the way you distract the queen from being involved in the defense is you play Bishop D4 which is a brutal move the white King has no legal moves the only thing you can do is take this is what we call an raction tactic you attract like a magnet a piece to a square it can now no longer defend the Queen the king queen G3 King H1 and in comes the black Rook the black Rook which stood so passively so passively playing a horrible defense against the pawn on D7 and the last move of the game is made by it Rook C2 a full Rook up for white he cannot defend himself he resigns what a game from dubov this man is a creative genius but but denil dubov was a little bit you know these are 12 games a day all the players get tired some of them start making short draws just to preserve their energy and keep a half point I mean I think they should not allow draws until like the 30th move whatever danil dubov sat down to play yanish Yan pishi has a has had a good day he's had a very good day up there in the standings I think he's tied for first then these guys do this this is the penultimate round of the day Knight F3 Knight F6 Knight D4 Knight D5 Knight B3 Knight B6 the other Knights come out they replace on the starting square and then those Knights also come out and they do this and they agreed to a draw I don't think that was repetition by the way because that was not the same night I'm not exaggerating by the way that that was not the same night cuz that was the night that end you know that that that night that whatever this is how they made a draw they decided that they were going to do a night dance okay chess R didn't like this very much drama has started there is a longstanding ing history in chess to make draws very long-standing history in chess to make draws for example D4 D5 C4 C6 take take Knight C3 Knight C6 Knight F3 Knight F6 this is called The Exchange slav and you just trade all the pieces and you agree to a draw there is also the Berlin draw that has gotten very Infamous these guys haven't been making the draw I'm just saying there is this draw Bishop B5 Knight KN F6 Castle Knight E4 D4 Knight D6 D and then you put the Knight there and then you Shuffle the queens hikaro and Wesley so do this a lot of top players make this draw right it's sort of like making a draw before the game begins some players don't talk about it some players just sort of do it you know like that this is just how chess Works earlier this year or last year hikaro and Magnus did this they did the Bon Cloud draw they both repeated moves with a bon Cloud now that's different than this that's different I mean at the end of the day there should be something in place about pre-arranged draws or cuz in any other sport it's like extremely bannable you get punished and everything the argument people were making on social media is that the Berlin is still real chess and these are all optimal moves these are not so these are deliberately bad moves as a meme right and now you say well what about the Bon Cloud not just what about the CEO of Fay Emil sutovsky tweeted people who are outraged about this game with the Knights should go check their reaction about Magnus Hikaru double Bon Cloud Magnus and Hikaru played in an online tournament their game was meaningless for the standings it was meaningless for the standings it was an online game it was not a world championship and for the memes they played a bon Cloud they didn't affect anybody's I mean none of that mattered because they both were qualifying for the top eight spots to play like it's not the same do I think they should be punished I I mean I don't think they will be punished like I don't you know but um yeah chess has this problem um and uh this I don't think this type of stuff should happen like if you want to make a draw play an opening you know but who am I I who Am I who am I dub NE like they don't care about my opinion nobody nobody nobody's going to listen to the YouTuber and and do anything nobody's going to listen to the fans anyway this folks sorry to interrupt my own video I have literally never done this before I recorded a full recap and I specifically was talking about dubov nepo and I was saying that I don't think anything is going to happen because in recent memory I don't think anybody has ever been double forfeited there have been double Bon Cloud draws there have been you know players offering draws in the first five moves there's players making repetitions and certain variations so I thought this was a little bit egregious and ridiculous but ultimately nothing is going to happen because it's the Chess World As I finished the recap I went to social media and I would like to let you know I was wrong T senson Norwegian journalist specifically focusing on chess says nrk the Norwegian uh TV network reports that fed decided to punish the players and the score has been set to 0 Z decision of Chief Arbiter Ivan sovi regarding the dubov neppo game game Danel du Yan pishi also he spelled danil's name wrong unless that's like how you spell it I'm pretty sure it has two eyes after opening next round and checking the game I waited till both players finish their games in round 12 and asked them to confirm if they had played the above mentioned moves they both said yes they both did not see any problem mentioned that the round started late and it was a late day my decision is because of this players shall take no action that will bring the game of chess into disrespe reducing the points scored in the game by the offending player options available to the Arbiter in my eyes both players are responsible for it I consider their result pre-arranged my opinion is based on the moves that they played oh my goodness that is crazy considering the president of Fay the CEO excuse me said people who are adamant about dubov neppo you know like I already I I already said this in the recap I don't know how the edit is going to look so they're getting double forfeited they're both getting zeros that oh my God see why couldn't they have just made a regular draw if they had just made a regular draw offered a draw said you know what we're you know we're tired that that's what all the players are doing I mean a lot of them anyway but I think we as always in the Chess World we need consistency we have we need consistency we don't even have the same rules in the open in the women's for like breaking ties we have no consistency whatsoever we have things that happen like this candidates drama farming rating points getting the rating spot the circuit and everything there's no consistency and now we have this situation where the players have been double forfeited that is nuts I stand corrected I thought nothing was going to happen uh let's move on with the recap cuz I'm still going to show you Magnus versus nepo but I'm interrupting my own recap to let you know wow that is nuts live edit back to the recap oh the chess world is on fire they they are not liking this speaking of yanomi the final game of the day is nepo Magnus and it was funny it was a funny game this is a rematch of course of the World Chess Championship anyway I don't think anything is going to happen to them uh for obvious reasons and and that the the Chess World just has more inconsistencies and memes and that's this is the Chess World my friends welcome you know welcome to it take take Knight F6 take take Bishop E3 this is a tartic cow caran very rare from Magnus and then something really funny happened on move 14 in this position seeing that Magnus was trying to arrive with F4 take take take take take Rook e two nepo went here and lost the game on the spot okay that's a bit of a that's harsh that's not exactly what he did that's a mistake because Magnus can literally take it he could he he could straight up take it take Queen takes Bishop takes and Rook E2 and just black is winning Pawn up the best move after Bishop C5 is Queen C2 neither player saw that that's what happens when you this is what happens when you play 12 games of Blitz in a day Bishop F6 Rook D1 and uh we go to an opposite color uh end game Magnus gives up a full Pawn he gives up a full Pawn in order to try to get a little bit of stability try to play Rook d8 neppo says no I don't want your Free Pawn I want to break in the center and I want to pressure you but Magnus is a very very good Defender he's like all right Yan come come get me Queen E5 there there's it's Magnus is way too solid here Rook D4 trades he gets C6 it looks really good the Pawn's really strong but it's not going anywhere it is held very tightly under lock and key yeah you know with white you could play like Rook D1 and you could also probably play Rook D7 even this is a draw you you just can't do anything so Rook E5 and uh the day ended with all the top players making many draws they agreed to a draw here cuz Rook C6 is falling and these are your standings after the first day of Blitz it is a crazy tie it's one of the closest tournaments there has ever been dub art Carls Nar Ari and Alexander rans are all tied with nine and then there's like a what am I what is that what why why why go back I did not touch the board why are you moving oh my goodness crazy it's nine a bunch we got a handful of eight and a halfs we have eights anything can happen tomorrow there are nine games to go uh and um I have also standings for you here here these are the women's standings G crushing it she has eight and a half she has a one and a half point lead so she is completely she is eight and a half and a nine ridiculous cuk davali bodnaruk Gina and kagna all with seven points I it's very very close but uh it's uh wow I mean so that's day one of the blitz massive time for first in the open we will see what happens tomorrow Magnus get getting hit by a door please don't hit Magnus with any more doors draws with horse circuses let me know your thoughts in the comments I will see you all tomorrow for the final day of the final event of the Year get out of here
