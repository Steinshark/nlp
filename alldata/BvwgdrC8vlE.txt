Is this the dumbest way of solving a maze? 
We're starting at this orange point here   and we've got to find, like, how do we get 
to the exit? And my idea is that I'm going   to let a gas go here and then you know at some 
point one of the atoms of the gas is going to   reach the exit. (Brady: Just by sheer luck?)
- By luck yeah. Gonna be basically moving   randomly. If I do more and more 
molecules than I would expect that   it would get- one would get there faster. 
I've released a poisonous gas here and then   eventually like a canary dies over 
here or something. And here they go,   so quite quickly they've spread out and they're 
going and they've got a few going around here. After a while this is the one that's going to end 
up winning; it it got out there first, and this   is the path that it took the whole time. Spends 
a bunch of wasted time in here but here you go,  you've got a solution. It does some silly things 
like going up here when it didn't need to,  but you know   this is basically how to solve this maze.
- (I love it Matt. I love the thought of there)  (was that one molecule there that was destined 
for greatness and it it didn't even know it   would be) (the one.)
- Right, yeah.  - (You know what it reminds me of? Sperm 
going to the egg. Which sperm will become) (a human?)
- It's totally like that,   yeah. And it's just pure luck right? I think 
there's various metaphors that you can draw here,   like, you know everybody is just bumping around 
randomly but the one person that you know   became a billionaire or something, 
they wrote their autobiography,   how I got here all the great decisions I 
made to beat everybody - it was just random. It's a bit of a sort of inside joke in that in 
computer science there's all these different   algorithms for doing things efficiently and, 
you know, solving mazes is a big um example of   like where you might apply these algorithms.
- (Like the lightning algorithm we did in a   previous video?) Right, exactly; and that was you 
know finding the shortest path, like you find it   efficiently and what you get is the shortest path 
from the cloud that seeds the lightning all the   way down to the ground. But here, well one thing 
I've done is I've said the maze is actually going   to be this physical thing I don't- I've forgotten 
about the concept of like cells of the maze and   their adjacency, like where you can get to from 
each; and I've just said well there's a little   tiny molecule in there somewhere and it's moving 
around it doesn't even know when it's left one   cell and it's gone into the 
other. It's sort of a joke about   there might be like the most efficient way to do 
something but, hey this works. And maybe it's not   the dumbest way because it does work right?
You could either create a computer, like   write all the code to solve this program, 
encode it in the transistors of the computer;   or I'm saying you know just release like a bad 
smell. You could maybe take this solution that we   found and improve it. Imagine that this orange 
squiggly path is actually a piece of string,   just pull it tight and then it would be a 
much better solution to the to the maze. (It would also be interesting to see if you 
pulled that tight how long it is. How much)   (longer a path did it take than it had to?)
- Yeah, one thing about this this maze is   that it doesn't have any kind of loops around it,   and that's kind of by design. And that 
means that works particularly well for   the string pulling type thing because 
you're not going to get a knot anywhere  and you're just going to prob- you'll get the- you 
will get the shortest path if you pull it tight.   Another thing you could do is model the 
interactions between molecules. Each one is its   individual little thing, it doesn't know about all 
the other molecules and it's just moving around;   in real life you might have some bouncing of those 
and that's I guess is like pressure and that would   help it expand out from the beginning and give 
you an even better solution, but obviously that's   harder to program because you gotta- am I bumping 
into this one? Am I bumping into that one? That   would be inefficient. And then another thing you 
could do is like do some kind of fluid dynamics   maybe? So if you had like some wind, just blow 
a hair dryer in here, it might help guide the   molecules out and the air from the hair dryer has 
to escape out here eventually because of pressure.   That might give you a faster solution. The first 
step is figuring out how to create a nice maze,   and I wanted that property where there's a 
path between every single point in the maze   and there's not going to be any loops. 
Going to have a network of points on a grid;   eventually I want to figure out what are the walls 
but I'm actually first going to think about what   are the paths that create the maze. What I 
want is to say that there's a path between   all points and I'm just going to just start and 
create random ones. So like, if I start drawing   in things here, what I'm doing is I'm adding edges 
not randomly - I'll add an edge if it's not going to create a loop anywhere and I also want to 
make sure that I reach every single point.   You know, maybe I go here and I have- go down here 
and then here. These are paths; and now the walls   I could create walls that make these 
valid paths but they're going to be   on a grid that's sort of offset from this 
one. So for example I better have a wall   here, otherwise I should have had a line that 
connected those two. I need a wall here -  I'm just blocking the stuff off that needs to 
be blocked. But you can't go from here to here   without going around here, so there should be 
a wall there as well. Likewise there should be   a wall here, wall here; and now I'm just going 
to enclose the whole thing. And then I'm going   to add a little like goal at the end. Maybe you 
start here, and so the maze is actually kind of an   artifact of me having found this network 
of where you can go to from each point   which is called a tree. Tree is just a network 
where there's no loops in it. It means that you   end up having a nice maze, because if you have too 
many edges then you don't have very many walls. In the code is I pick a width 
and a height and I create this   fully connected graph here, so that is-
I'm just saying like what is the grid graph? That   means a graph where everything is connected to 
thing to the left, above, to the right, and down   but just for some fixed rectangular size. And then 
I assigned a random number to each of those edges   and then I asked Mathematica to find the tree 
that spans all of those points - meaning it visits   all of the vertices there that has the smallest 
total weight on all the edges. That's just a way   for it to come with a random maze each time. 
So for example, this was a potential edge I   could have picked but maybe it had a weight of 
100; that means it had a cost basically of 100   whereas this one had 1 so that's why I picked, you 
know, these these ones, not that one. So if we do   that can you see we get this network of all 
the paths that you can take from each point?   I then have a nice guarantee that I can put a 
goal here and a start point there and I know   there's going to be a solution, because you can 
get to anywhere in the maze from anywhere else.   So now I've just got to figure out the step I did 
here when I went from the green pen to the brown   pen - what are the walls that make- make that? 
Not too much more code and you get this picture   here. So side by side here we've got the network 
and we've got the walls that should create that   network. You can kind of see it looks right; so 
for example here we've got a path from this point,   you can't get directly there you've got to go 
up and around and down which is correct - yeah,   up and around and down. So that's how we've 
created the the walls. Now all we've got to   do is simulate molecules inside this environment.
- (Is that hard or easy?) Uh it's just - yeah. It   is hard or easy. There's a few tricks you gotta 
do to make it not just take forever; on the other   hand like I just gotta make one animation and 
post it on my Twitter so I don't really care if   it takes too long. So it's a bit of one of those 
things where I could optimise it and make it very   fast or I could, you know, solve the maze in a 
dumbest way. So I switched over to Python to start   stimulating the molecules; here's a code that does 
that. Imagine at each point I'm trying to figure   out, I've got a molecule here I'm just going to 
add a totally random direction. So each time it's   going to like take a tiny step in a new direction. 
And I just- I need to make sure that I'm not going   to cross a wall. I end up here and then if I 
go over here, hey that's a problem, I'm now   intersecting with the wall so I've got to go back.
- (So these aren't like your) (famous bouncing balls that only change 
direction when they hit a wall? They can   change direction) (whenever they want?)
- They're moving every time step and that   that is um what's called Brownian motion or just a random walk. You know, molecules 
dancing around; and then in real life that might   be because they're actually bouncing into smaller 
molecules, like these might be some heavier gas   in just the air bumping into the small molecules 
of the air, just making it look like hey they're   jittering around all the time. But I've got 
jittering around randomly all the time, but also   I've got to make sure - don't go into a wall. If 
it looks like you're going to go into a wall, just   reverse your direction and you won't hit the wall. 
So I programmed it so that each point I know what   are the nearby walls around there, and then I do 
some maths to say, hey am I actually intersecting?  So this block of code here, I'm saying I've got a 
point p and I've got some sort of structure that   tells me what are the walls that I've got going 
on, and I'm saying am I going to clip into the   walls or not? Now I run the code and it will just 
keep on simulating again and again and again. I   do them in big batches and then the first batch 
that has a winner in it I just stop computation.   So I'll show you what that looks like.
- (But surely every batch will   eventually have a winner?)
- Right, but I only- I do each batch for a fixed-   for a maximum length of time and then move on to 
the next batch. So there I've kind of guessed.   I've said, you know, 10,000 steps or whatever 
is probably going to be enough - or I've   kind of set a goal and I'm just going to 
simulate enough until I get to a solution.  - (Because presumably if you do an infinite 
number of batches eventually you'll get)  (one particle that just by luck, just perfectly)
- Just goes the exact way, yeah, totally. I could   for example reject some of those solutions and 
say ah that's not good enough, and keep going keep   going keep going - I'll leave my computer running 
overnight. If I just run this, hopefully it still   works. I'm simulating a batch of I think 64 points 
for 45,000 time steps and I've got a progress bar   saying this is how long it's going to take. We're 
doing some screen recording to capture that,   so this is much slower than it usually 
is, but yeah I mean I would just run this,   leave it - computer beeps when it's 
find something and then I would bring   it back into Mathematica and do the animation.
Let's look at how we do the- like draw everything   and draw the back trace and stuff. Once we've 
found a solution, my code there just outputs,   like here's all the paths, and I know that one of 
them won in the end. So first of all I've got to   figure out what what is the molecule that won? And 
also I've got to just draw them all going around   and everything like that. I'm loading in solutions 
that were found. We ended up running 1856   molecules would be in the animation, one of 
them got to the end. What I did was I set   it up so that this is the y = 0 line; so I find a 
solution just one that reaches a negative y value,   that's kind of an easy test for me. And 
then this code here is doing the animation.   Each molecule obviously just gets drawn as a 
little point here. And then we've done that check   to see which is the one that reaches a negative 
y value, and then that's the one that we've   realised is the winner and we trace it back to 
the beginning. Some people are like, well how do   you know that one was gonna win? Like how did you 
know to like put a circle around it? Well actually   I just kept running this program and I logged 
everything. When I'm creating these frames I'm   not running the simulation I'm just displaying the 
simulation. The simulation as you say is a file   that has logged all the other movements.
- (So you could open up like, you know,   a spreadsheet or a log) (that would 
show the winning molecules path?)  - Yeah that's right, I basically stored a 
spreadsheet where I've got 1856 different   molecules; and then for each one of them got 4500 
(x,y) coordinates - just massive loads and loads   of numbers. - (You know what my question- next 
question is don't you?) (I want to see the- I   want to see its log. I want to see the log of the 
winning ball - is that even) (possible to find?)  - The log of the winning ball? Yeah yeah 
that's that's possible to find.  - (Does he have a) (name or 
a number that winning ball?)  - Yeah he's got an index, so it's 
1836. So if I look at the 1836th  thing here - here are all the points that, so 
the starting point was (1, 9) and then at the   end it's got a negative y value.
- (That's his path.) - So it won.
- (That's- that doesn't look very   complicated) (for how wiggly his path was.)
- I've cut out 4489 other points. And you can see 
that because here is its path.  - (Yeah, got a bit stuck there 
for a while) (didn't he?)  - Totally stuck there. Pick another number, 
we could we could compare how it did?   (How did ball 1 do?)
- Yeah good good idea.   Red is the winner and blue is the first one.
- (So ball one got stuck up there and just   hung around there for ages.)
- Yeah that's right. Ball 2 did that, ball 3 did this, and obviously 
I kept simulating, kept simulating,   eventually I got to ball 1836 in the last batch. 
Here's 1835 - did that. Each one is just totally   random. So if I change this slider, click, 
here's all the different paths that were found.   (Let's see if we can find a really 
funny one where he got stuck badly.)  - That's not a great one,
looks like it came down, was doing pretty straight   line stuff and then hung around in that area. 
The other one didn't get very far, the scale is   changing because it's fitting, but it's obviously 
just in the first 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9ish.   (That's fascinating.)
- And the winner.   The winner looks- I mean it's 
still doing something pretty dumb. Look at these people in the
