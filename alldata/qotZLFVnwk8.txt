my spicy take is that XML is better than yaml because there are situations where XML is appropriate but there's no situation where yaml is appropriate Norway I love that we somehow made a language that hates Norway it's so good dang shots fired okay let's talk about XML first so XML got a really bad reputation I mean I personally love writing HTML for my temp my my datas uh the reason it got a really bad reputation is because people were using it for things that it should never have been used for XML stands for extensible markup language and if you're using it as an extensible markup language it's actually really great so let's say you're working on something like I'm making a new kind of book and I need to annotate all the verses in the Bible and have a chapter headings and stuff it's great for that it's really good when you have to document and some things are italicized and some things are foreign language and subtitles and all that stuff it's really good for that it's not good for stuff like I need to configure This Server and the server needs to know if the value is true or false no that's bad don't do that that's not good use for XML uh but XML does have some uses for which it's appropriate and I think the fact that now everybody is writing react and they're writing it with jsx and jsx is just inline XML I think that shows that there are cases where XML is pretty good facts confirmed facts confirmed facts facts facts proved proved Twitter Twitter [Laughter] there's gonna be some react and these in this that are gonna be like you are gonna die uh yeah but on the other hand gamble on the other hand I think there is never is never good there's always something better than yaml where we finally made it to go 1.21 and I'm very happy about this you know why because yeah oopsies because yaml repetitive repetitively bit me in the behind on Go 1.2 ask me why ask me ask me no I don't even want to know why well when you say it uh say in your test file test this against Go 1.2 this is interpreted as uh that as go one two you need quotations no no screw your quotations I wrote the string it's not a number it's a string it's clearly a string it's a string why are you editing my strength so it was like two or three different times I had a repo where I'm like these tests aren't passing why aren't my test passing I've just upgraded to go 1.20 and it was like oh no I decided that this was one Go 1.2 and so gamble is always going to do that to you I'm not gonna lie to you like I've never liked yaml to begin with but this is somehow making me more angry about yamo skill issue how is that a skill issue you have to quote your numbers when you're writing something like this I mean the thing is is that I don't look at JavaScript and it's Myriad of terrible apis and when people shoot themselves in the foot I don't go skill issue I go no JavaScript is horrible sorry that you're being emotionally bruised by a language sorry right like I get it I I make concessions when concessions make sense oh what Norway just doesn't deserve to be a country in yavel skill issue no no no no no no no that's a pretty good one I didn't realize I fell right into I just actually made a pun and that was a great pun that was a great pun on accident by accident all right a better choice now I understand why people do gamble there are better choices but you can use Tamil Tom's a genius Tom's a genius Tom is a genius yaml's the only thing in which was so bad that we'd rather use a language called Tamil that's pretty much yaml and just one guy did it I just can't even believe it exists I can't even believe this worldly exist and it's so stupid it's just the stupidest world we existed and we actually live in this world we live in a world in which there's like 19 different interchange formats and they all suck they all have their stupid edges I don't like yaml I don't like Tamil I don't like Json I don't like the fact I can't have a just a gosh darn trailing comma at the end of my list of anything in Json all because that stupid flow diagram is missing just a trailing comma that's all it had to have at the end and it just pisses me the hell off okay you know what they added they added comma comments in chesson you know what they didn't add trailing commas what is that face palm face palm why anyways okay I like how caddy does it with caddy the canonical language that caddy understands is on but they have adapter so if you want to write a yaml you can but it'll just take that yeah I won't turn it into Jess on behind the scenes then they also have specific caddy language awesome I need more so you can give it the caddy language and then turn that into behind the scenes so let me get this straight we take a language and turn it into another language to take that other language to do something that takes something else and makes it does something so we have just layers of continuous abstraction and you can give it to nginx config and it'll turn that into the test on behind the scenes if you have the cycles and time to spare that's probably the best solution for most people but when uh the only way uh to do it is yaml it's like no it's also too error prone there's uh there are too many things you just have to always quote everything also also either the yaml specification has all these features that nobody ever uses because they're really confusing and hard and you can include documents inside of other documents with references and stuff and it's like oh man I don't want to understand any of this stuff can we just agree that's a fact of life I don't want to learn any of this stuff like I don't want a degree in yaml skill issue again and then if you're not careful they'll be like oh yeah the first three things I fed in uh it to understand that but then the third one was just like using some parser they found on the back of a truck and it doesn't understand it and it's like oh man who is this guy that said this sentence someone uttered this sentence it came out of his face hole oh it's so good these quotes are unnecessary these quotes are incredible what do you mean yaml never appropriate XML sometimes appropriate all right real talk I'm gonna do something I'm gonna hear I'm gonna do something in chat that's going to be very Illuminating and I want you guys to answer honestly and I'm going to take I'll make sure that there's no bit bit thing okay this was very shocking for me this was very shocking for me when I saw this okay if you cannot use Jason or XML how let's see what do you use please do not say in chat don't say it in chat don't say it in chat let's see hot hot hot hot if you can't uh let's see can you send data yes no I don't know how right gosh how do I say this okay you have web app right you have web app cannot use Json can you send data I'm genuinely disappointed bisco I'm actually genuinely disappointed by you because I specifically asked you not to do that um a lot of people when you make these uh when you make these uh what's it called ah bisco that you genuinely ruined it dog um it is shocking what you can what you you would see I've done this question before where I've asked it and it's literally hundreds upon hundreds of I don't know what you can do other than Json or XML like it's shocking people don't understand that there's like interchange formats that are different no no the point was not to get the answer Beast goal I didn't want you to say protobufs I wanted you I wanted to show the people that didn't know other interchange formats exist Beyond Tamil yaml and Json right that's the crazy part I I forgot what I said I said something along the lines of Json sucks and I hate using it as uh as an interchange format and people say so you use XML and I'm like what who uses XML and they're like well then what would you use in literally hundreds of people did this it's Twitter which means most people didn't ask the question because they didn't want to feel stupid it's kind of scary a little bit right like people don't realize that there's a lot of interchange formats out there and they all have uses and uh Json is not the only way it's just really not the only way this is actually kind of interesting I did like what he talked about with XML the idea that when you have a markup I think that what he means is markup right HTML that's really where it's great but if you use XML to configure a server then it sucks I'm on that team I'm on that team and I think yaml sucks too but I don't agree with tommel I'd rather use Json honestly I'd rather use Json uh I wouldn't want to use Json I think I'd actually rather use Tamil oh I would I don't even know what I want to use to tell you the truth I don't even know what I want I hate it all I hate it all the end the end XML is better than Json a Jed
