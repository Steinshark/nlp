ladies and gentlemen there's a lot of Chess content that you can consume on YouTube most of it will tell you how to play chess the right way it will tell you how to play in the opening middle game end game whatever it might be and that'll make you a better player but I've got a playlist on my channel called how to lose at chess and it's usually viewer game submissions that are absolutely catastrophic now today's game it's absolutely fascinating because uh it looked like for the majority of the game that the person who sent it in was playing against a cheater and that's all I'm going to say for now um and we're going to take a look at this game so our protagonist is Alexander from Australia uh he's been given an honorary Grandmaster title despite only being a thousand rated uh and he's a kangaroo because obvious reasons uh White is from Sweden uh and white is a Swedish meatballs which are also very tasty now uh this game was fascinating because in a thousand level chess okay some of you are a thousand some of you 1500 some of you like 200 some of you don't even play chess but a thousand is right at that level when you just got all the basics down and you're good enough to understand just how bad you are and you can play games that are spectacular you can you can also play games that are horrible so white plays Bishop C4 now this opening is the Karo Khan defense for those that don't know black is trying to go D5 now generally when you play with the white pieces if you can take the center with two pawns you should take the center with two pawns because that's just it's just a good thing in chess you also should not develop your Bishops before you develop your Knights because your Knights are less flexible you know that your Knights are going to be moving into the center of the board but okay Bishop moves out D5 but now after this trade white needs to move the bishop again that's a waste of time you really shouldn't be doing that and now after check black gets very natural element with Knight C6 actually as you can see according to the computer computer is already arguing that black is an advantage let me tell you right now it is an accomplishment to have a worse position in four moves in chess okay so Knight F3 now what I would have loved to see here from black is again developing the knights developing the bishop developing the pawn and then Etc a lot of 1000 level players have tunnel vision okay so A6 all right my sub my viewer Alex he saw the bishop he was like I'm gonna attack it bishop move back he's like I saw the bishop I'm gonna attack it now it's not it's not bad as long as now he goes back to normal development he's got to take the center develop his Knights okay a lot of us do this we get tunnel vision now taking the center like this is fine but uh I do want you to be careful when you push too many pawns out like this in the opening and they don't have good support your opponents might start attacking them or attacking them or attacking them and you got to be really careful trading all these pieces while your king is still in the center but that's a little bit too high level castles Knight F6 and black is just doing very well I like Black's position uh what white should do now is white should attack the center with the move D form but white plays the move C3 first which is obviously it seems like preparing this move I guess uh and now Alex plays an excellent move um now we are not at the part of the game yet where I was like oh my God what is white doing like throughout this game I was sitting there just absolutely blown away at the level that white was displaying I mean white was playing really high level moves um now Knight D4 okay white is like slightly worse from the opening but it's nothing terrible white is slightly worse because if black makes this trade these pawns are doubled isolated and Frozen like they're they're blocking each other so black would be able to get quick play but again if you don't see that the computer says this you really it's tough to evaluate that black is better here especially because black goes here now we have take take and a very smart move here by white already the really good decisions Begin by white D3 the simple Pawn trade to activate the queen get the bishop out the computer undoes my move servers Queen takes D3 and so on D3 is a very sophisticated move I love black keeping the tension here keeping the tension you can take my Pawn alright go ahead you take my Pawn I'm gonna take it with the pawn of the night I'm all good and I got this on the way I got this on the way right so now white plays rookie one another decent move pinning the Knight to the king and black castles high level chess being displayed by these two 1000s all right now white took a look at the position and probably went all right well uh that night in the center is very menacing uh so I'm gonna go Knight D2 now 92 loses the game but it's extremely hard to understand why and I you know Knight D2 is going to be considered a blunder but not at the 1000 level it's a blunder because in this position black can sacrifice the Knight and the point is that if King takes now there's like various checks on the king and you know black can get this and maybe black gets Bishop C5 threatening mate and it's just a very unpleasant position but that's I mean that's heart like white is stopping me like I don't even understand right but the computer shows an advantage so Knight D2 is played Black has various Knight F2 Bishop h280 okay black plays A5 I mean black is a human Black's not an AI so we have this this and now another excellent move by white which is Bishop to C2 all right again computer is saying it's not a good move because of A4 no human on earth plays A4 here uh at this level the point is that white is threatening Bishop takes Pawn but the thing is white is actually not threatening Bishop takes Pawn because after it takes takes takes the queen loses a Defender and you should always look for checks that is something called a discovered attack and now Queen takes Queen on the very next move because white just cannot do deal with everything but black plays rookie 8 and now another excellent move by White Queen G4 activating the queen targets the pawn in front of the king and is in fact threatening to take that pawn now with the bishop also Bishop H6 also Bishop G5 also The Rook is coming I mean why does playing really really really well uh now black plays Bishop D7 I don't like that move because while it does attack the queen after Queen H5 this Pawn is very much delicate um now black gets tunnel vision again just like he did on the other side of the board uh he got tunnel vision um and decided to start pushing a bunch of Pawns okay uh now G6 is played and queen H6 so the queen is snuck into the position now black plays F5 so as you see this is a game between two guys one of them loves pushing his pawns the guy with black guy with white has moved one Pawn which honestly is better and there are very very quick ways to lose this game for instance Bishop B3 checks the king let's say the King goes to the corner now we have Bishop G5 let's say the queen moves Bishop F6 is literally Checkmate so you gotta be really careful and really sure when you push Pawns in front of your king you're not letting in a massive attack okay so F5 played Bishop G5 and now a very high level move here by Alexander um very high level he is a Gotham subscriber he doesn't just move the the queen out of the way he was definitely worried about various checkmating attacks uh danger levels your queen is hanging but you do not have to move it if if what you can create equal or exceeding danger Bishop f8 and uh now this queen is hanging if you take that Queen I take your queen now what you should do beyond that is you should calculate can my Bishop take anything after it takes your queen the answer is no it cannot take this Pawn uh but if there was a rook here that would be a stupid idea by black because I would take the Rook on the next move so Bishop f8 now white doesn't have to take the Queen White could back up but white does this black does this bishop F6 and now Rook E6 okay um rookie six is a mistake rookie 6 is a mistake because while it does attack the bishop it gets The Rook on the same exact diagonal as the king and you have to be careful and this is only a problem because you pushed your pawns if the pawn had been back your king would have been safer now Bishop B3 danger levels you can't take my Bishop boom boom right now white doesn't see that on this move but white does see that on the next move and black is in serious trouble so when you are about to lose material in a chess game like black is right now you've got to think all right well what can I get for this material that's not going to absolutely devastate my position okay that's the way you need to think about things um what I would do here with black is I would bring my king and I would try to unpin and then just give up The Rook what I would not do with black is I would not try to counter attack and then lock my Bishop into the position black lets the second blunder decide the game very common sometimes it's very difficult to adjust after one blunder uh and uh you make a second one and a third one and you lose you got to just deal with the consequences right now play a move like A4 or King F7 lose your Rook but the game goes on it's just Rook for Bishop instead of that black goes Bishop to D2 and my dear subscriber plays this move just thinking that the bishop is defended it ain't a very nice move by white not rushing taking this Rook because now blacks overreaction has caused them to lose a bishop too you cannot get out because neither of your Rooks can move because they're pinned their first Rook is pinned so just Rook E3 here would win the game for white which is crazy so rookie 2 E3 takes and now black is gonna not just lose a rook they're also going to lose a bishop and that is exactly what happens and now white is completely winning all right we have made it oh we've made it to the stage of the game where the game is you know just simply over now there is some hope here okay if you want to make a comeback here with black you can do it in a few ways number one flag your opponent in a Blitz game yes but right now White's got seven minutes probably not gonna happen number two Safeguard your king that's the most important thing and a safety measure has to come first if the black king is not on the back rank where he can get ladder mated and instead comes out like let's say over here like this I'm that's not possible right now but I'm just saying if you can Safeguard your king you can prolong the game and then you're gonna have to use what you have maybe you use a a bit of counter play maybe you get this Rook to the second rank with the bishop that's the way you got to think about it what can you use to create counter play I got news for you white is not going to let it happen white plays B3 which is yet again and do you know how many people here would move one of their Rooks or Bishops B3 is an amazing move what you're doing with this move is you're guaranteeing and opening of the position either that way or this way and now White's other Rook is gonna go in this is in incredible technique from a 1000 amazing Bishop B7 Rook B6 I was like oh my God this is like my poor sub is facing a guy you know using mittens to beat him Rook B6 Bishop D5 now what I would do yes you can take the pawn and that is exactly what he does but what I would do now is I would get my second rook in and just go for the King again the king is on the last Rank and the whole seventh rank is open so that's the easiest way to win now this is a full winning of a bishop I mean it does not get any better than this he spotted this in four seconds I mean really it's just oh this is the demolition all right absolute demolition Rook A2 Rook A7 Rook CA also there but he's he's just not letting any comeback happen this is textbook and now just B4 B5 B6 but you might be wondering Levy this is one of your low rated games right where's the comeback that's the beauty of these things that's the beauty of these videos just when you think it's completely not there anymore uh it's uh that's when the comeback begins so black decides that his King is going to go out on his shield or his sword rather he's gonna run to the center of the board and it's over C4 is made in one C4 is Checkmate in one move now for reasons I cannot fully explain to you I think at this point I started realizing oh I see there's going to be a plot twist in this game I don't actually think white is cheating I think white just played a really really nice game so white instead plays B4 now that is incredible because white spent seven seconds on that move and if White's eyes had just looked at the pawn right adjacent that would have just been made by accident probably they would have been like oh it's check oh never mind so B4 um now obviously white is trying to make a queen but don't forget you don't need to make a queen in this end game you could just win by Checkmate you can trade the Rooks you could make a queen absolutely that is certainly a way to win check here now what you should do is to get rid of the blockade you should play Rook C5 check okay that yeah see why does mixing plans why does sort of going a little bit like kid in an arcade doesn't exactly know what the play tries to play everything you don't need to win all the Pawns in fact if you win all of your opponent's pawns uh that can prolong the game you can get unnecessarily low on time not to mention that in the future you got to be sure you're gonna Checkmate them okay so fine white is going to go Rook G7 Rook G4 try to win the pawn now white is back to checking but again white is playing without their Rook Wyatt was playing quite well for a little bit but now white is stopping playing well uh Rook B7 King A6 oh this is perfect the king is on the edge of the board which means just play Rook B8 and Rook A2 just pin the King on the edge of the board and win the game I mean it was mate in two with Rook B6 but fine white plays Rook B6 it's mate I mean it the second opportunity to make the opponent in one move instead we have this let me tell you something right now that is disgusting and Despicable the fact that the Rook can move anywhere and it would be check and you don't take the pawn is disturbing not to mention that you you have made after that but this is just a free rook okay King H2 H4 Rook A2 is made again Rook A2 is made again this is three mates in One I no longer think that this individual is playing illegitimately I was absolutely floored by their technique prior white plays Bishop E5 all right white gets tunnel vision sees this that Rook is now capturable instead blackplay is Rook takes E3 because black wanted to save The Rook it is now made in one for a fourth time but now white spots Rook takes G6 now white plays Rook takes G6 check and it's like oh discover Check Yes and remember this is tunnel vision at the 1000 level you have made in one on the board multiple times but you really want to Rook okay you're like a child in a store and your parent is not letting you get the sugary cereal all right like my parents and you freak out you're like I really want the sugary cereal okay now I'm happy okay fine white Mist four checkmates in one no problem just the average typical 1000 game where you play at 90 accuracy and then you miss four checkmates in one but now the game is over because quite simply you will get the king out like this and the easiest way to win this position this is always tricky when when a king can dance around your pawns it's it's kind of annoying it's tough to to figure that out so what you could do is you could actually lose the Pawns this is actually one of the easiest techniques is to get your opponent to take some of your pieces because actually visually speaking this position is easier to win I mean you might think it's crazy but think about it if you get a queen it's just laddermate right but when you have this thing it's like Ring Around the Rosie I mean the king's just gonna dance around and you got to be really really accurate all right it's tough It's not the easiest thing in the world now white doesn't do that instead white goes for the queen which makes sense if anything I would make a queen with this Pawn to remove This Ring Around The Rosy situation um and we've now made it to the end of the road uh and of course after you know uh all this hard work white promoted the queen gave a check and went forward with their second Pawn and delivered a stalemate up 28 points of material
