how many weeks are there in a year everyone 
knows 52 and how many days in a week seven no   one's good they're wrong they're wrong that can't 
be right because 52 times 7 is 364 and no year has   364 days there are actually 52 and a tiny bit a 
little bit more changes a little bit but there's   more than 52 weeks in a year and because of this 
slight mismatch I have discovered what I think is   an undocumented a zero day exploit in the UK tax 
code if you're in the United Kingdom there's a   chance because of the number of weeks in a year 
that you are paying more tax than you should   or be it only in one or two particular 
situations and not that much money but   the point is you should be outraged so 
outraged you watch the rest of this video   or if you just want the conclusion you can skip 
ahead to 10 minutes and 20 seconds [Music] hello   and welcome to the first and potentially only ever 
annual stand-up maths tax video because it's the   tax season in the US your tax season whether tax 
year ends at the end of the calendar year here   in the UK we have until the end of January to 
get our tax returns done and paid so that's a   very recent memory and at the beginning of April 
is when our tax year takes over there's a lot of   going on at the moment so I thought I'd make a 
video to say many happy tax returns and we can   briefly celebrate the wonder that is doing your 
taxes obviously I'm all across my taxes I make   sure I got lots of money aside because you know 
self-employed I got to pay them all at once then   what do you mean we spent all the money on 
what money guns I don't remember money guns oh oh yeah oh yeah the money guns what a poetic 
way it's uh so we need how much okay we'll uh well   I'll deal with that in a moment for this video 
we're gonna have a look at the slightly unusual   tax this is the UK ni contributions ni or National 
Insurance is an additional income tax here in the   UK it's also an employer tax which is put into a 
specific pot for very particular things the state   pension maternity cover job Seeker allowance they 
all come out of this National Insurance pot and as   long as you pay into it for the required number 
of years you are able to access those government   benefits which just has the one weird Quirk that 
it's an optional tax well you have to pay it if   you have to pay it but if you don't have to 
pay it you can still pay it so some people   who are self-employed still opt to make their ni 
contributions to make sure they're eligible for   the benefits that's it funds so it's not a 
standard tax but it is taxed in a fairly standard   way tax bands you pay National Insurance in the 
standard income tax ban approach where on the   hmrc website that's the UK taxation agency ahmrc 
stands for hey mate right cash and uh they set   uh the boundaries as well as different classes of 
National Insurance but the vast majority of people   are in category a so you can ignore the other ones 
that actually means you can ignore that lowest   category because we don't have to use that at all 
so actually you don't pay any National Insurance   if you're Class A and you're being paid weekly 
up until you're earning more than 242 pounds a   week or if you're being paid monthly that's 1048 
pounds a month and I know this should be obvious   but apparently it isn't you don't pay marginal tax 
on any amount that's in a different category so   if you're in the tax Band you only pay that rate 
of tax on money in that band so if you earn 243   pounds a week just going into the next category 
you don't pay 12 on all of your income you only   pay 12 on however much is in the next band like 
a pound or whatever it ends up being and anything   in that middle band you're going to pay 12 on and 
then you go up into the top band which kicks in at   967 pounds a week if you're being paid weekly or 
4189 if you're being paid monthly and then above   that it's only 2 which is a bit weird most tax 
bans the rate keeps going up it's a progressive   tax so you know everyone pays their fair share but 
because National Insurance you're paying into a   very set pot for very predefined benefits once as 
an employee you've paid your contribution you're   done so you've got that one big 12 rate for the 
middle band and then above that a mere two percent   so far so standard like your accountant could have 
told you all this but what your accountant won't   tell you is why hmrc are using such a weird ratio 
to go from months to weeks because I saw this page   and I was like wait a minute how on Earth are they 
going between those and I divided one by the other   and it turns out they're using four and a third 
weeks per month so if you take the monthly amounts   as like the canonical tax Band and then you divide 
those amounts by four and a third weeks per month   and then round to the nearest pound you get the 
weekly bans that makes sense but there aren't   four and a third weeks in a month it's a different 
ratio however to work out that ratio we need to   start with how many days are there actually in 
a year and that gets a little bit complicated   the standard leap year has 365 days except 
when it doesn't then it has 366 in a leap   year and your standard issue one new leap day 
every four years gives us an average in the   Julian calendar of 365.25 days except the Earth's 
orbit isn't 365 and a quarter days it's 365.2422   so what we do across four centuries instead of 
having the full 100 extra days we skip all the   years which are a multiple of a hundred that 
takes four out brings us down to 96 but then   we unskip all the years which are a multiple 
of 400 that 97 extra days every four centuries   gives us an average of 365.2425 days per year 
close enough except none of us are going to   have careers that span for centuries and the 
next time we deviate from the one in four leap   year approach it'll be the year two thousand 
one hundred and I really hope I'm not still   working then so for all of us we're going to be 
working when there's 365.25 days per year that's   what I'm going to use for all my calculations 
you divide that by seven and you get 52.17857   weeks per year divide that by 12 and it turns 
out there are 4.34821 weeks per month fun side   fact you can actually just work out the average 
number of weeks per month for both 365 and a 366   day year and then average the two waiting them 
three to one and you get exactly the same answer so what does this mean for tax bans well we 
can use this information to scale everything   up to be your per annum salary or rather what the 
amount per year is for each of the categories if   we multiply the lower tax ban for monthly people 
by 12 we see the ni contributions kick in with   an annual salary of 12 576 pounds assuming that 
they're paid equally across every single month and   yes income can go up and down depending on your 
sort of employment we're going to ignore that for   my approximation because most people approximately 
are paid the same amount every single time you   just divide your income up across your pay periods 
now weekly people we can take the weekly lower   bound multiply it by the number of weeks in the 
year now that we know that exactly and you get 12   627 pounds which is bigger that means if your paid 
weekly instead of monthly you need to earn more   money before you start paying National Insurance 
that's a difference of 51 pounds and 21 Pence   51 pounds and 21 pounds that people who are paid 
monthly have to pay an eye on for people who paid   weekly don't and because the tax rate is 12 you're 
paying an extra six pounds and 15 Pence of n i so   there you are if you're paid monthly you're paying 
six pounds and 15 Pence more than you need to for   exactly the same benefits as people who pay weekly 
I accept the next tax Band changes everything   for some reason hmrc are using their incorrect 
conversion ratio in such a way that people who pay   monthly always get to the next category first and 
if National Insurance was a standard progressive   tax would the rate keeps going up that would 
always be bad for people who pay monthly but and I   goes down goes from 12 down to two percent and 
people who pay monthly hit that drop back down   again 188 Pounds and 68 Pence before the people 
who pay weekly so they pay 10 percent less tax on   that 188 Pounds and 68 Pence which is 18 pounds 
and 87 Pence so people who pay monthly pay that   extra six pound fifteen going into the first 
band but then they pay 18 pounds 87 less coming   out of it so actually if you run the numbers 
people who pay weekly spend longer in the more   expensive band than people who pay monthly if you 
compensate one against the other the difference is   12 pounds and 72 Pence so once you're in the top 
category people are paying monthly are saving 12   pounds and 72 Pence compared to people who pay 
weekly to recap up until an annual salary of   twelve and a half thousand pounds no one pays any 
ni tax that's very fair above that if you're paid   monthly you're paying an extra six pounds and 15 
Pence more than if you were paid weekly and that   carries on until an annual salary of 50 and a half 
thousand pounds and the median UK salary is in   that range above 50 and a half thousand pounds it 
flips and if you're paid weekly you're now paying   12 pounds and 72 Pence more than people who pay 
monthly and that carries on for any salary greater   than that hello to everyone who skipped straight 
here from the beginning of the video now we're   been throwing a lot of numbers around here six 
pounds 15 a year 12 pound 72 but what do these   numbers actually mean what are people missing out 
on because they have to pay this extra tax well we   can see what those amounts of money actually buy 
you in the UK in 2023 by going out and doing some   shopping because I'm not here by myself I've 
got Alex a camera person I've got Nicole the   producer so all three of us are going to head 
on down to Sainsbury's and see what we can buy foreign [Music] 6 pounds and 15 Pence a year is 
roughly 51p a month and 12 pound 72 is a pound   and six pence a month so we had to find things 
you can buy from the grocery store as close to   those two monthly values as possible and as a 
bonus round we could try and find things that   equal the entire annual values we split up and 
decided we had exactly 10 minutes before we had   to meet back at the cash registers and here is our 
haul all right oh and the receipt better keep that   I can claim that more expenses get my tax bill 
down what do you mean that's not how that works   what do you mean I can't spend my way out of this 
that's ridiculous right surely I spend more money   oh yeah that's not how it works okay so anyway 
this is a grapefruit that cost me 55 Pence for   one fruit outrageous but in my case pretty 
close to 51p a lot of things were 50p but I   was like that's I don't like round numbers 
bang 55 pants and then over here one pound   and nine pens again lots of things for a pound 
but I thought a pound nine Pence is actually   closer to a pound and six so I was very pleased 
with that so there's my egg Mayo Deli filler   so if you've got a deli to fill egg mayo and 
my grapefruit but let's see how the rest of   the team did okay so um Alex well done 
uh bought a tiny chocolate bunny that's   pretty exciting the tiny chocolate bunny cost 60 
Pence 60 Pence check out 60 pounds have a look   just sending that back for verification someone 
got ripped off did you think of those are 50p   bunny it said 50 Alex claims it was 50p we'll 
uh we'll go to the camera get a replay on that yes and the candle five pounds was that is that 
your so if I hit Alex you can't see this because   he's behind the camera he's the natural habitat 
of the camera person he's now on his own phone   reviewing the footage of him walking around 
the supermarket because he was not expecting   this to be five pounds but I'm looking I'm 
looking at five pounds on the receipt wow   someone Alex I mean I don't want to give you a 
let's just say I'm going to give you a c minus   for could have done better I spoke too soon clutch 
play by Alex forget the weekly stuff went for the   annual 12 pound 72 Pence and bought 12 pounds 
74 Pence of disgusting boneless lamb shoulder   joint so I'm gonna Award Best annual amount to 
Alex I'm not going to show this again but if   you're paid weekly and you earn more than 50 and 
a half thousand pounds in the UK the government   is taking one of these away from you every year 
everything else in here is Nicole's and Nicole   I can't have but notice there are many many 
items there are more you went for summation   uh so the SpaghettiOs and the tarragon are a 
team all right let's add these up the SpaghettiOs   uh one pound and five pence and 
the tarragon 90p so a pound 95. they said they were 16 16p for an entire 
can of Hubbard's food store it was   okay pound six minus 16p is the 90p nice around 
Monday okay either Sainsbury's uh indulging in   some um misleading pricing or the stand-up math 
team require lessons in reading comprehension so   how is this fixed well hmrc just have to use the 
correct ratio I have no idea why they use four   and a third weeks per month I guess it's easier to 
calculate I don't know if anyone knows please do   let me know but they should be using the correct 
ratio of 4.34821 weeks per month and that fixes   everything so we can fix the monthly bands where 
they are and then do the correct conversion to get   the weekly ones and the whole system works nicely 
so they just need to fix that one thing and then   once that's dealt with no longer will people who 
are paid monthly have one fewer grapefruit a month   no longer were people who were paid weekly and 
May a lot of money have one fewer delicious egg   Mayo Deli filler per month if we fix this problem 
this horrific problem in the tax system we can   make National Insurance contributions there once 
and for all and uh all I have to do now is fix my   tax payment issues and don't worry I have a plan 
thank you so much for watching this video I hope   you enjoyed the one weird Quirk I found in the UK 
tax system I'd like to finish by saying thank you   so much to all my patreon supporters your one 
weird Quirk that I found in the how nice you   all are system I guess but anyway genuinely 
honestly thank you so much to all my patreon   supporters and don't worry if you can't afford to 
support me that's fine just enjoy the videos the   people who do support me you took I mean I used 
to do this as a hobby make occasional videos in   my spare time but now it's a substantial part of 
my career and I can make all the videos I want and   honestly the more support you me the more amazing 
videos I will make I promise I'll spend all your   money on making videos I hear in England and uh 
absolutely not doing anything else with that money   now I have to go see a 
person about a thing [Music]
