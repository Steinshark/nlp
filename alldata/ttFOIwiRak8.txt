Hello everyone and welcome in this video We're gonna be talking about how Koenigsegg stole the spotlight from Bugatti. So Bugatti was all excited because their new Chiron hit 0 to 400 kilometers per hour back down to zero in 41.96 seconds just under 42 seconds So they were super stoked about 42 seconds and then Koenigsegg said "Hey you know we could do that a lot faster" and they did so they did that 0-400-0 in 36.44 seconds so in this video we're gonna analyze those times and talk about how Koenigsegg basically destroyed the Chiron in this test So starting off with some specs about the vehicle the Chiron weighs about 2,000 kilograms, about 4,400 pounds and has 1500 horsepower the Agera RS was a little bit modified So it does have an upgraded engine this isn't the base engine that the Agera RS has it has their one megawatt engine in it so 1360 horsepower the car only weighs 1395 kilograms so 600 kilograms less But it does have a cage in it so that would add a little bit of weight and the cage that they added is removable So they have this like customer option that you can have a cage It's pretty simple to take in and out so the first thing we're going to do is analyze the time it took for each of These vehicles to get to 100 km/h, 200, 300, and 400 kilometers per hour I've got the braking times there already so the bugatti chiron was able to hit 100 kilometers per hour in just 2.4 seconds they were able to hit 200 in 6.1 seconds 300 in 13.1 seconds and 400 in 32.6 seconds Then they were able to brake from 400 down to zero in 9.3 seconds now Koenigsegg didn't provide their 100 200 or 300 kilometer per hour times But they did provide the 400 to 0 and the 0 to 400 and they also have a plot of the acceleration on their YouTube video so what I did is I literally took that plot from their YouTube video and Counted pixels to estimate their 0 to 100, 200, and 300 times and I know some of you are going to be cautious about me Doing that which is why I did a control so I used the same methodology I did for 100, 200, 300, and I did it for 400 to see if it would match up with their claim and Counting pixels the way, I did it I got 26.85 seconds versus their claim which was 26.88 seconds So only off by three hundredths basically what I'm saying Here is you can trust these numbers now Koenigsegg talked about the poor track conditions in the low levels of grip and you actually see that in their data so 0 to 100 In four point one five seconds which obviously for the Agera is not very good It could definitely do better with better track conditions so lots of wheelspin they're having their 0 to 200 in eight seconds flat and that you know proves they were having quite a bit of wheel slip In that 0-100 because in less time they went from 100 km/h to 200 km/h than it took to go from 0-100. Shouldn't be the case They said they were getting wheel slip as high as 180 kilometers per hour and then 0 to 300 the time here is 13.35 So about dead even once they get to 300 km/h bugatti still has a slight edge And then they're significantly quicker to get to 400, 26.88 versus Bugattis 32.6. Now as far as braking something interesting happen so bugatti actually stopped in less time nine point three seconds versus nine point five six However, they did it in a longer distance, 43 meters for the Koenigsegg versus 491 For the Bugatti and so basically why I think this happened is bugatti has an air brake that deploys But it takes 0.8 seconds for that air brake to deploy so that's a lot of time where it's traveling at a very fast Speed and not decelerating at its max Decelerate and so once that's deployed its deceleration rate of course improves It's able to stop very quickly, but a lot of distance has already been covered But ultimately they're pretty equal in braking you know off by less than 10 meters from 400 km/h to zero so very even in the braking game now something I thought would also be interesting to do was to analyze the G-forces of these accelerations, and so we're going to use this as our example 0 to 100 km/h Acceleration the average acceleration is equal to the change in velocity Divided by the change in time our change in velocity is 100 km/h for this segment, so 27.7 meters per second, that's the same as 100 kilometers per hour We're dividing that by our change in time which is 2.4 Seconds that gives us 11.57 m/s^2 we divide that by gravity 9.81 m/s^2 and that gives us our acceleration of 1.18 G's for the Bugatti Chiron from 0-100 km/h now we can fill in the rest of these for the delta of 100 km/h to 200 km/h the Bugatti averaged 0.77 G's, from 200 to 300 it averaged 0.4 G's and from 300 to 400 it averaged 0.15 G's now for the Agera there was quite a bit of wheel slip so that's 0 to 100 only Accelerating at 0.68 G's and then actually improving from 100 to 200 At 0.74 once they got out of that wheel slip and were able to put all of their power down perhaps a little Bit more added downforce from the speeds they're getting to. Then from 200 to 300 averaged 0.53G's and from 300 to 400 they were at 0.21 G's. So what have we learned? What are our conclusions? Well basically this entire race was won and lost between 300 and 400 km/h? That's where all of the time was spent Bugatti was actually quicker for the whole race up to 300 km/h And then it lost it from that that final leg of 300 to 400 and that's where it spent so much time Accelerating the Agera was actually accelerating with 40% more G's than the Chrion on average from 300 to 400 km/h That's where it was able to make up all its ground it didn't have great traction So it wasn't that quick from 0 to 300, but it made up all of that ground in the 300-400 segment And that's why I was able to run the race now It's important though to think if you were actually sitting in these cars which one Would you enjoy riding in more actually you'd probably have a lot more fun in that Chiron because it's accelerating with much higher g-forces Initially so that's 0 to 125 miles per hour or 200 kilometers per hour. It's gonna have those really hard hitting all-wheel-drive G-forces that's gonna really set you back in that seat versus the Agera was just having some wheel slip trying to get traction So we could really start to put that power down which it did in those super high speeds So it was the quicker car but you know in those lower speeds it actually be more fun to be riding along in that Chiron I think that's at least worth pointing out Then here we have the measurement which I didn't discuss previously But basically the g-forces for braking, super even! So you know based on distance not based on the time And this is you know 1.28 G's versus 1.3 G's So really you know pretty much even 0-300, 13.1, 13.35 you can see very close there up to 300 km/h You can see very close in the braking all of this race was won and lost in that 300-400 km/h segment. Also I think it's worth mentioning that the Koenigsegg could be faster if they had better traction conditions Obviously they were having some wheel slip occur from zero to 100 They had wheel slip as high as 180 km/h so if they could improve those low times They could take some time off of this overall time So why was the Koenigsegg so much faster from 300 to 400 kilometers per hour? Well first of all it does have a major weight advantage So it's 600 kilograms less than the Chiorn also it probably has a pretty significant aerodynamic advantage so its frontal area is 1.873 m^2 versus they don't have information for the Chiron but if the Chiron is anything like the Veyron 2.07 Meters squared it could be somewhere around that perhaps a little more perhaps a little under but point is less surface area means It's able to punch through that air better of course the power required to punch through air Exponentially increases as you get into higher speeds And so you know that advantage will become very clear once you get to these higher speeds also all-wheel drive versus rear-wheel drive You know the Chiron does have more horsepower at the crank than the Agera RS But it's only sending power to two rear wheels versus this is sending power to all four wheels so those you know power loss Could be perhaps more with this Chiron so you know all things considered It is going to be losing more power through the all-wheel-drive system One thing kind of holding it back a little bit makes it super fun from zero to you know 200 km/h But after that the Agera RS has the advantage just sending power to those two rear wheels So we'll thank you all for watching, and if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below!
