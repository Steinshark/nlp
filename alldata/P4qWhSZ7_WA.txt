- We bought 100 of the craziest items you didn't know you could buy on Amazon. Oh God, I spell it. And we bought it off of Amazon. Trust me guys, we bought the weirdest
and most expensive items on all of Amazon. You want to watch this
video until the end. Box. This looks like an anime girl. - Ooh. - I'm going to let you do this, so I'm not the weirdo. - Anime body pillow. - Wait. Oh, is it? Oh, that's mine. Give it to me. I want it. - It's mine! - I want it! I want it! I feel like your dog wants to see it. Look, he came over here for the pillow. - Oh, he wants the anime body pillow. Hey, on this side we have a
nice little Overwatch girl. - That looks like a Twitch streamer. - And then on this side you
got sexy Overwatch girl. - Close your eyes. You're not a sinner. I swear, I saw another Twitch person. I keep seeing it everywhere and it keeps making me
think of this pillow. - It's because it makes
anyone look attractive. You could wear it right
now. You should do it. It'd be crazy. - Tell me I won't. - You won't. - Editor, Photoshop it on me. All right. Moving on. - All right. Moving on. - Definitely should not be sold on Amazon. - What is that? - My new favorite pair of glasses. - Why are you like this? - How do I look, Jake? - Perfect. - Yeah? - He'll never see this coming. - Oh wow. You got me. - Gotcha. - Feel bamboozled. - Hoot and Holler animal caller. - I want a hoot and holler. I'm a bear. - Blow through it. - Wait, this is a scam. - I'm going to be a Turkey. - Hey Jake, why don't you try it? Ha, you just made out with Chris. I just made you kiss a dude. Ha! Watermelon slicer. All right professor Johnson, this is a watermelon cutter. - I don't trust this table. - You're doing a good
job professor Johnson. Yes. What is this for? - I need that for further
research tonight. Hold on. - This shouldn't be sold on Amazon because watermelon abuse
is a very serious problem. What is wrong with you? Are you like a five year old kid? I can eat one faster. Multiple. Oh, a sack. Jake, what is in the sack? What is with you guys and horns? Why two horns? - You drink out of it. What A Viking chug. This one, you can make spoons out of food. Oh, we have eggs too. - It's the edible spoon maker. All right professor Johnson, I have some cookie dough right here, let's make it into a spoon. I think it's mandatory we
taste test the cookie dough. It tastes good. - Got a little bit too much there. - Professor Johnson, have
you never done this before? - All right, let's make a cookie spoon. This is way too thick. I like them thick. - That's what he said. - Don't touch that. - Several months later. - All right professor Johnson, I think our spoon is ready. You get the handle and I get the spoon - Teamwork. - Yeah. So there you go, if
you want to make edible spoons. - Don't, 'cause it doesn't work. - Package us. That was weak. Dude, this is already open. - Did you already open this? - What? Wait, what? - What you do, is you put
a box of tissues in it. - Oh you pull a tissue out of its butt. - Yeah, you pull a tissue out of its butt. - Hey, we don't want to get demonetized. - Can butt holes get us demonetized? I know you want one of my tissues. Just reach on in and get it. - Hey, think fast. Awe. This is supposed to be for something you grab tissues out of
and there's no tissues, so. - Look at the cat's head. It's just looking at us
like, why did you do this? It's showing us its butt and looking at us at the same time. - He gave us no choice. - Gentleman. - Is this a gun? - No, it's a water cannon. Oh. All right, we'll use these later. We need two liter bottles. God it has like the force of a water hose. - I would do it, but soda's disgusting. You shouldn't drink
soda, it's bad for you. - You know what else is bad for you? - Anime? - That thing power blast
in the back of your throat. You'll never believe this. - Oh, what's in here? No way. What? Wait, you can buy this on Amazon. - It's a machine gun. - Wait a minute, here, let's open it up. - Metal and heavy. This might be actually a real gun man. - And we bought it off of Amazon, without having to put in
like gun license or anything. - Here's our box. That's not a box. This one's for you, it's
the micro penis cure. - Oh, this doesn't need
to be on camera though. I just need this. - Was that not for the video? - No, this is just for me. - Look at this. Oh wait, this is, oh, this is dehydrated water. All you have to do is just
add water and you get water. - Dude, let the viewers see it. That's some dehydrated water. Look it's dehydrated water. You got to add water to hydrate the water. - That's all you have to do. Now we have water. Best $14 ever. Underneath the cap it says,
seriously, what did you expect? How do I- - It probably needs batteries. Will Fortnite ever go away? - If pigs fly. - Wait a minute. - Ethan, is Fortnite gone? - Nope. - Buckets. - Is Fortnite gone now? - Nope. - Is it gone now? - Nope. - Geez. - Yes. - Who taught you how to use a knife? - Hey, no need to judge. - I'm not judging, I'm just a little concerned
about your survival rate. - As you almost cut your hand. - What is this? Oh- - No! Can I trade with you please? - I don't know, these are the
best Minecraft posters ever. - All right, can I have this one? - All right, that's fine. - I'll trade you a fat suit. - That's not a fat suit,
that's a ripped suit. Look at that guy. He's Swol. I want to put this on my body right now. - This just in, Mr. Beast
female of viewership skyrockets, as Chris gets a ripped body. I'm mining. All right. I'm going in. - You on the wrong street, man. - You better back up Cuz. - You're on the real wrong street cuz. - Give us them diamonds right now. - Give me your diamonds. - We want it. We want the coal too, man. - Is that us smoking? - Yeah. Yeah man, you got smoke to coal. Time out, time out, time out. Is coal a little too offensive, I mean Minecraft is PG,
they're nine year olds, can we talk about smoking coal? - You don't smoke coal,
you make torches out of it, you dingus. - Forever alone statue. Oh Chris, this is perfect for me. You know what I'm going
to do with this statue? Put it right there. - Enter. - Dude, it's a giant enter key. You could hook this up to your computer in place of your enter key. - That's hilarious. - That's actually really cool. Professor Johnson, would
you like a funny shirt off of shopmrbeast.com? - Well, I already have
one, but what's one more. - All right, added it to the cart. Hit enter. I want a funny shirt too. Enter me again. I think we need another enter. - All right. - Pigs are going to fly . - Bubble custom. Does wearing a bubble suit
make you invincible to pain? - Ah! - You feel that? - Yeah. I didn't know you were
going to throw it that hard. Oh boy, I'm so excited for
my new Mr. Beast merch. - Hey, did you order a shirt? - Yeah. What are you- - This is a the meat lovers shirt we sell. Dry skin cream, fragrance free. Here you go, you can
moisturize your heart out. - The box God is telling me, apparently this is the worst
rated moisturizer on Amazon. - All right, let's test
its moisturizing ability. - And break! - It literally feels like Play-Doh. This is the worst lotion ever made. - Whoa. - What? Why are you allowed to buy that on Amazon? - Why? It should not be legal to buy
stuff like this on Amazon. Don't hurt yourself. Oh, this one's already open. Yo dude, these are the grass flip flops. I don't think they're ready for this. Why walk on grass, when you
can walk on grass flip flops? - You can buy dead people
on Amazon. Do that. - It's fireproof, this is a thing. All right, let's test our skull boy. Notice all the skull is fireproof. Skully, how you doing over there? You like fires, do you
like medieval weapons? Now we're opening a package we forgot to open earlier. It's an it's everyday shirt. - Taco Cat spelled
backwards is still Taco Cat. - I'm Dude Perfect and you're watching
basketball trick shots. - Oh my God. Holy crap, it's a crossbow. - You can kill someone with that. - But am I going to? - Probably. - Yeah, probably. - Up next, we are testing a
weapon of mass destruction. This has been known to kill
many countries in the past. - Cat's butt. Yay, we hit it. - I can't believe they
sell that on Amazon, I mean dude, look at how it brutally destroyed that cat's butt. An invisible phone for people
who use their phone too much. Ow! Oh dude, these are the big jerky flowers. - Aw dude. That's so cool. - Wait, drop what you're doing, this requires all our attention. - The beef jerky! - Dude, that smells good. - That's the base for it. - Let me taste the flower. - All right. - These are pretty good flowers. - This is really good actually. - This is 1000 lady bugs, which you probably shouldn't- And you probably shouldn't be
able to buy this on Amazon, 'cause that's kind of
creepy shipping bugs. - Look at them, look at all those cuties. - Yeah, lets open it up. - We should not, no, we should not. - They do look alive. They're all moving. - Yeah, they're all alive. - Yeah. - Let's go let them
go. Let's be good boys. Be free lady bugs. Oh my God. Oh my God, it literally is the weirdest feeling thing in the world. Ah, I don't like it. Hey, those little guys should go off and probably eat a bunch
of aphids and keep the- Ah, it's on me! Ah! - Box us. - It's a box in a box. I'm going to definitely need that knife. Wait, are you going to
say the famous line. - Money shot? - Money shot. - Money shot. This is why I had you bring
your dog today, for this. - Oh my God. But my dog's a boy. - This is a costume we
got for Chris's dog. - Look at his little boobs. There you go, Marilyn
Monroe in puppy form. I'm sorry you have to
be seen on the internet. - Boomer's a good boy. - Well, he is a good girl right now, but. Come on, come on Boomer - Oh yeah. Boomer, don't take your clothes off. - Don't be like Boomer,
keep your clothes on. What is this? - It's another dinosaur. - It is. What? This is something you shouldn't
be able to buy on Amazon, dinosaur abuse is very serious. As you guys know, we are dinosaur experts. We've raided many malls
with dinosaurs in the past. Dinosaur, come over here dino. Now, as you know, in the past
we've used orange dinosaurs and we made a video about
how they went extinct. But little did we know that red dinosaurs are actually
a special kind of dinosaur, they're actually amphibious. That's why this dinosaur's alive. Is it a taser? - I think it's a taser. - Which one of you guys bought a taser? Is that a light or a taser? - It's a taser. - It's definitely a taser. - It's a light. Oh gosh. That should not be sold on Amazon. - That should not be. - Roasted tiered chicken, candy canes. - Gross. - Can we act like we didn't get this, so I don't have to eat it. - I really don't want to eat this. This is probably going to be the grossest thing I've had all day. Oh my God. - It smell like chicken.
It does, dude, this- Smell that. Dude, it tastes like chicken. - It tastes like I'm
licking fried chicken fry. - What did they just take a chicken and put it through a candy
cane strainer or something? - A candy cane strainer, gross. - That is coyote urine. - Ew. This is coyote- - Chris, if you drink that- - Hold on. - I don't- Why would you smell that? - Oh my God. I'm going to throw up. - oh God, I smell it. - Oh my God. It's all over. Oh, my hand smells like it. - Hey let the viewers smell it. - Don't open this. - Oh my God. - Viewers- - Do not spill it. - Viewers, oh gosh. Viewers, what do you
think of the coyote urine? - Get that away. - Hey box God, please throw it away. - Dude, I put my nose in it. That's good. - Bear urine. No, we are not- - Nope, no. - I swear to God, Chris. - You got to open it. You have to. - While Chris is opening
this up, leave a comment. Which do you think smells worse, bear urine or coyote urine? This is a really important question, make sure you answer right. Oh dude, what is this? Ah! - It let all the air out. - The coyote urine smelled
worse, if I'm being honest. - Yeah, if I'm being
honest, it still smells bad. This came from thepeemart.com. Everybody go visit thepeemart.com. - We are never opening up
animal urine here again. All right people, never again. This one says kangaroo. Sounds like you guys bought a kid toy. - Yep. That how you do that. - Do what? Huh? Huh? Huh? - Are these more dinosaur
suits or something? - No. Is this a giant, it looks like giant water balloon. Food fight. - Food fight. - Excellent. - For Valhalla. - He did a trick shot. - You could say that
fight was eggscellent. - Hey, moving on.
