all right so this is the stack Overflow survey results I assume I actually have the correct one this is the 2023 overview 2022 for like an hour that would just be I wouldn't I wouldn't necessarily say I I would do that but I might do that all right so for 13 years we've delivered industry leading insights regarding the developer Community now I have a lot to say already about that and one of them is that neovim's been the most beloved editor for a long time I don't know is I don't even know if neovim is still a beloved editor well here's the thing they changed the wording again this year so well just I don't want anything for when we get down there okay okay so you've seen a little blanket I think okay I forgot to turn off alerts I cannot believe this every single time there's more buzzwords when you talk about it though you've been delivering industry leading alert management for the developer Community I agree with everything you just said it's actually that was actually so beautiful I don't think I can redo that one all right all right happy we're gonna skip over that I honestly don't need to know about that so let's see hold on so we got some learning to code technology and tech technology what what and Technology what and Technology also technology and don't forget technology technology and AI it's like balmers up there yelling developers except these screaming technology technology technology technology okay all right here we go so here's the overview developer profile learning to code from online resources increased from 70 to 80 since the 2022 survey okay that's not too surprising I don't think respondents 18 and under are those most frequent selecting online resources Zoomers uh they don't read uh that's why I read articles TJ is because Zoomers can't read it's a theory I've figured it out yet they haven't uh videos blogs forums to learn from uh respondents 25 to 34 were the top age cohorts to learn uh to have learned from the online courses and certification 52 but still learn more from Traditional School okay so I'm I'm not in either of these two I'm now officially old to not even be a part of that but I definitely literally ancient in every they're basically like Hey we're signaling to you uh you're an old guy yeah I'm one of those people that use a code editor from that certain generation so you know certain Generation all right so let's look man all right oh I always get confused by how their site works okay so most people like technical documentation do you think this is true TJ as someone who writes neovim technical documentation how do you feel that 90 percent I feel like this is probably like when they do surveys about how many people have lost their teeth but the surveys administered like at the dentist's office they're like oh yeah yeah I've lost regularly daily twice a day twice a day that's them reading technical documentation to learn yet somehow if you know 17 out of 18 Americans floss yet somehow my wife and I both don't floss and everyone I know doesn't floss what are the chances all right A lot of people okay so hold on uh okay well see they just put they just jumped us up in some room for Zoomers I know they put us in a weird spot okay education so let's start with education okay uh education the most professional developers have attained a bachelor degree 47 with a quarter retaining master's degree do you have a bachelor's TJ you do right I'm surprised with 26 for masters that seems high I would assume because of AI ml oh Fair data science right there's a lot of data science masters of engineering well it doesn't say necessarily if it's like a masters in this either there's like lots of people who do Masters and then they find out that they can like do code you know they're like oh I learned philosophy philosophy is just thinking well now we'll make money for thinking now I make money by thinking yeah obviously you didn't get a a degree in thinking because they're still your chair right here why move it sorry dog sorry that works even though I definitely see it's sticking out right here but I covered I cover it so it's okay all right uh anyway so here we go so Wow 2.14 have only been the primary slash Elementary School that is surprising is it look at that professional developers people who get paid to do this almost one percent never made it past sixth grade that's cool that's right that's considered uh primary or is primary all the way up to high school no that's like fifth grade usually okay okay I don't know these terms okay I'm not educated which one are you in private doesn't matter all right it's like unclear unsure all right so six percent uh made it to high school 12 and a half percent part of my crowd some amount of college and university uh let's see then we have a bachelor's degree 46 master's degree not very much in this I don't know what something else is what do you think something else means I'm trying to like boot camp yeah because that would be you never completed elementary school right yes you've never went to elementary school but you didn't do any of these other ones homeschooled homeschooled still counts as a primary school usually those ones are all the kids that were smart right those are always usually the Smart Ones that went on and did something you know yeah they graduated TJ weren't you homeschooled what was I yeah no but we're gonna homeschool our kids I'm pretty sure really gosh that sounds so hard that sounds so hard oh we don't have as many as you at the current time so like golf down all right learning how to code uh let's see okay so we already read this like over this overview so learning to code by age let's check it out by age oh interesting so 18 and under mostly online look at that number almost 90 blogs and forums that's not even like where is docs yeah school or online of course learning how to code generally oh this is just like I learned how to code okay yeah yeah this is learning how to go generally yeah what's really crazy is books really aren't very large in here and neither is coding boot camp I'm actually a little surprised by that I figured this number would be way highly 18. they haven't even had time to go to boot camp a lot of them okay like if you're 12 you probably didn't graduate boot camp already because when I look this way to look at you I'm looking away from you and it just feels really awkward all right hold on transform flip horizontally hey TJ yeah look at that oh what's up hey I'm looking the wrong way I couldn't remember which one all right a family or a friend that's pretty awesome that's what I'm hoping for I hope Neil likes coding yeah I'm hoping I'm trying to get my kids are starting to like it all right all right so TJ do you fall into this category got started all right so still really high in the online business um it is just shocking because online I'm surprised that they have online courses or certifications different than uh online resources well that's like going through some like actual class right that's not like watching a YouTube playlist or something okay true okay do you think fireship has a fireship certification I thought there was something on on his program where you could get something but I don't remember I wonder if that counts uh all right school so 62 pretty high books pretty high books coding bootcamp still really low still really low I'm kind of way oh really not a big jump in the next game last actually less than this one what about this one even less what about the last ones it even less almost getting to my age like even at my age it's still like not very high by the way when I was in university there like while I was doing uh uh my Bachelor's in Computing science I remember there was someone in my class yeah that was like 65 and I always thought man that guy is so awesome imagine going back to school at 65 and being like I'm Gonna Learn computers I don't know why he had like an 84 year old woman voice but that's just like how I imagined it but anyways uh dude he was awesome it was just crazy to be like man you're like a whole new life I started taking some classes at um like my local Community College at various points and it was just like awesome to see older people in it and they were just killing it you're like go get it dude you know it was just exciting brush it um all right let's kind of skip this should we get I I kind of feel like that this kind of like where people learn to code and all this kind of stuff it's interesting but it doesn't seem as exciting do you want to kind of get into like the technology side of things let's do some technology let's do some technology okay we're going to start not a big fan of that red can I just be honest red you know I feel like they use the wrong technology here it's just really intense all right so we start with the most popular Technologies let's Okay most popular Technologies in 2023 this year we're comparing the popular Technologies across three different groups all respondents professional developers and those that are learning to code this will be super interesting to see those that are learning versus people who are actually doing things because I assume it's going to be all just typescript svelte solid.js react yep in the other category okay okay here we go so programming scripting in markup languages okay so 2023 uh continues JavaScript streak as the 11th year in a row as the most commonly used programming language do you think that this is a bias selection as part of stack Overflow it just feels like there definitely is biased right because who's I haven't gone to stack overflow in at least like I don't the only time I ever go is if I have a JavaScript problem actually I tend to actually make it there when I'm just like how do I get this CSS and it's just like job you know stack over if I'm like oh yeah that's the thing but now that I have a co-pilot hey maybe Cody someday uh yeah that's true you know it goes pretty good so okay so JavaScript HTML CSS this does feel like I'm getting trolled right now um python squeal typescript bash and shell okay that last one that is shocking let's see it for learning to code they just don't write that much bash I guess well they also apparently don't program because they're they're putting HTML I thought you just had some video about HTML is better than C what are you go you going back on your other videos I'm going back at this point uh I'm also okay so this has to be the most surprising out of everything well I feel like people hear that they should write C like they're like hey want to learn programming and then you know out comes all the all the gray beards uh you you should really learn if you're not writing C you really don't know a lot of code and then I don't know anything so they're just trying to write C and then obviously it doesn't work because they don't know what they're doing so they have to go to stack overflow you think what about College University teachers see that's another good call dang it previous opinion invalidated I still think that that one is for a lot of people who aren't in the main like who are learning alternative ways they hear that they need to learn C okay um I would like to say that I do love seeing rust being owned by PHP 50 more phpers out there this is growth too this is learning to code so this is rust's right because anyone could funnel yeah the funnel yeah okay how about professional developers what do we got here so yeah that lines up JavaScript obviously huge typescript huge bash this still really confuses me C plus plus really confuses me too right now when they say this what does this mean does this mean the language that they're working in scroll up to the top does it say uh commonly used no it's just what programming languages do you use I think it's just whether you've written it or not basically yeah is it actually earning money no can't be okay because rust would be way lower yeah rust has to be way lower okay hold on someone says faster than lime has killed this survey for me forever what does that mean is there some things that we don't know is there some like cool piece of I do a lot of C plus plus right now I do I do C plus plus from time again yeah C plus plus for game devs seems really reasonable and for embedded but it also seems like stack Overflow isn't the place people are going to learn those things yeah I don't know okay it does seem like a place where a lot of pedantic people would leave notes and that seems like C plus plus land would probably be happy okay that is true people I I do notice that whenever I do anything with C plus plus I get the most amount of comments people love C plus plus and talking about it like it is the most intense well actually and then there'll be like a comment being like well actually likely what it actually means that someone's like actually what likely means and then someone follows it up with like you get three four definitions of what likely means well are we talking C plus plus 17 or C plus plus 23 I mean they actually did a backwards incompatible switch with the compiler fights because it was experimental certain team but now this move to and then yeah okay I don't even know what's happening anymore I don't know why we're talking about it what's happening okay so I don't know I'm just gonna go back to this yep all right so let's see anything else we can take from this I'm still really skeptical of this whole rust being 12 and a half percent I'm sure it's just have you written this in the last year right like it's got to be something like that right so then where's okay well because it's going to be really low sadly but five percent of people five percent of people writing assembly professionally don't believe it yeah uh I don't see oh camel it hurts but watch next year we're gonna double we're doubling we're gonna double I think that if we use the power of Twitter yeah it's already happening it's already happening it's already happening I can feel it I've been seeing more and more of it oh camel's almost as popular as Zig nice and zig's the most annoying language people tell you you'll find out Zig makes the most money later sorry that's a little spoiler but someone tagged you about it on Twitter I'm sure already so no I didn't know this okay oh nice you'll see it like okay I literally haven't been on Twitter for the last week I've avoided everything uh all right here we go so postgres uh first place none of that surprising I would expect postgres uh then my sequel then SQL Lite then because no I mean squealite squealite uh and then  because they uh you know people made bad decisions okay it happened at Netflix we have a database that we're needing to change anyways uh we've got Legacy what can you do yeah I'm surprised about Maria DB it's probably just from your stream people hear you yell Maria and then they think I gotta check it out and then they find the database and then it's Prime approved yeah I'm also surprised Hive is not on here well they really they really go a lot of these is Super Bass a service or a database you're asking the wrong guy glass rocks I thought the Super Bass was a service is it a database or it's a service right yeah it's a service that's a little confusing to have something that's a service but also a database Super Bass is just postgres yeah nice I think two points that they would filter these why don't they just filter them out like they know that it's not in the spirit of the question just remove it well I think what it shows is that minimum 2.77 of people can't be trusted in whatever this survey is doing right now for all questions wow is really high among learning to code okay so if you're not a professional developer and you're not learning to code you're an other coder and you love my squeal okay okay anyways these are boring Cloud platforms uh this as expected that's expecting surprising nothing blah blah blah blah blah blah uh web Frameworks okay so this must be a big one all right so no JS react Jake I'm how is jQuery how's Jake how is 15 of people who are learning to code using jQuery I'm just confused if you read me node.js react Express and jQuery I wouldn't be able to put them into one category of thing look yeah yeah it is kind of interesting to have web Frameworks and Technologies node.js which is really just a you know it's just an environment to run V8 yeah you're like well I need to run JavaScript you're like well I guess I use node.js we're like okay I guess that's a web technology is it it's almost like exactly the opposite of a web technology just like neuter oh you run that web technology webtech webtech I claim this as webtech okay then a lot of other stuff I'm surprised Drupal is still around here please oh my goodness one percent of people are starting off with Drupal I feel bad where's Elm Elm okay I was wondering I've never really elmed I've only done charm which is like elm-like right yeah it has some aspects that are like inspired by the by the stuff but um okay supposedly the guy who is uh the maintainer is working on some stuff to bring out to the back end which would be interesting but I haven't seen any like progress he did some talk about it so I'm waiting to hear about it but it hasn't had a commit in like two years which is a shame that is a shame and I would also like to say equally as a shame that quick which is actively developed on is losing to Elm which hasn't had a commit in two years why did they do the survey uh three weeks ago four weeks ago is that recent really yeah 2023 I I had a video on it's on my channel youtube.com the prime time again The Prime Time agent it's a great channel it's a great Channel yeah you would know I'm subscribed oh you are what are you subscribed as oh well my the place I usually subscribe from on YouTube is at t-e-e-j underscore DV that's where I usually subscribe to all the channels that I like when you're not making videos right oh that's right I do make some videos all right so other Frameworks and libraries this year we'd uh we disaggregated.net to be more specific okay so other Frameworks slash libraries .net five numpy I'm surprised numpy isn't just a hundred percent really you haven't touched numpy in a year that BS everyone like at some point you copy some way to make a graph and you matplotlib and use pandas numpy and matplotlib you don't know what you're doing and out comes a graph and you're just like graph I know why though it's because most of them don't know it's actually called numpy they think it's called NP MPD um that's probably imported as those things so they just didn't even know that it's called numpire pandas okay that's pretty reasonable it is also interesting that spring framework is oh baby and other Frameworks whereas wait for which is like the node version in some sense is not is over here this very confusing separation yeah wow flutter nine percent that's higher than I would have thought Cuda all right let's go this is what killed these uh this is an extremely confusing grouping like how do you even how do I just need to go to the next one hugging face transfers how is this in the same place as QT which is the same place as Apache Kafka which is the same place as numpy like they are so different like what is this list and they got 70 000 responses so I mean clearly it's scientific it's science this is science all right all right all right other tools uh this year docker's the top of uh top used other tool among all respondents okay I love that as a category it's the top used other tool thanks I love being the second place loser a lot of it a lot of these other tools also happen to be all geared around JavaScript we got npm we got yarn we got webpack we got uh Vite yeah I'm sure there's I'm sure I'm missing I don't know what chocolatey is but I'm just gonna assume it's another one it's the windows installer thing yep and you know notice C plus plus has the same problem they got make uh they got C make they got uh Ninja right nice same thing can't believe ninja made the crossover from fortnite to build system you know it's really incredible once he stops dying his hair blue I mean the World opened up speaking of blue hair dye I've just I don't know if I can do it yet okay I'm still working on it you already had the wedding that you said that was the oh I can't do it because I'm going to a wedding with my father-in-law finally respects me and doesn't think that I'm a weirdo who streams in a cow barn a sad tiny violin and now what it's a horse barn very different okay so we're just waiting I'm just waiting to hear when you watch this later comments blue hair below for Prime to wear blue hair okay yeah comment if if I get a thousand comments I'll definitely dye my hair blue because those are the Thousand remaining Subs that never came in okay you got that YouTube you stuck the subs you stopped the count you literally like oh come on all right integrated development environment uh this kind of already feels like a cheat going on here x okay so visual studio code is the most frequently used IDE then vim and notepad plus plus common Ides that we all know about and use regularly specifically notepad plus plus can you go to Just professional for a second I just want to see the professional numbers it's did it even change I think it went slightly in favor um you're telling me 25 percent of soft professional software developers like yeah I use no pi plus plus regularly what I don't even what is the question okay screening I'd love to see their question and like what they're trying to say integrate that's all this integrated development environment I think it's at the bottom maybe at the bottom of this which development environment do you use regularly over the past year and which do you want to work with over the next year please check all that apply notepad plus plus what the I was gonna say how cool it is that neovim has like 12 or 11 of developers but like imagine getting a third of the developers as vs code and being notepad Plus it is strange it just really shows you what people's expectations are yeah I don't even know that I I honestly don't even know what to do with this list because there's also people are used regularly using Nano well it's like probably to write commit messages because they're using notepad plus plus to develop in and they don't have a git integration right okay that makes sense okay uh I still can't believe 75 USBS bleep yeah that is really crazy that is crazy obviously it's a little bit it's a little bit skewed this is where like I feel like the SKU comes in for sure because it's like but I don't know the people that are on stack Overflow are asking the kind of questions like everybody was writing JavaScript not everybody actually writes JavaScript in the whole world so yeah there's lots of people writing no JavaScript codes there's actually quite a few people I'm not even sure yeah I wonder if more people don't than do probably uh anyways visual studio also I think this might be the biggest shocker that is a big shock that's well we've we've got Beast go we do got B scale they want to be like Beast go so that makes sense see I got people saying they hate JavaScript yeah gamedev's an entire Branch where JavaScript is just like not a thing it's like we're not using they're not using the vscs you know they're probably not using a lot of ese uh probably a lot of sea lion yeah there it is this represents the game devs that are on this this site we're here we got it I don't know what condo is but okay someone probably just like got a bunch of their friends to write in their personal text editor all right asynchronous tools here let's read the question which collaborative Work Management and or code documentation tools do you use regularly over the past year and which do you want to work with over the next year all right so jira see the problem is is that they're not saying like do people want to work with it that's later that's later okay okay that's the second phase of these questions okay jiren Confluence are two of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse it's true once at Lassie and Lisa releases a few more products it's over they got bitbucket or stash they have jira they have Confluence I don't know what the fourth one is though like it hasn't been released otherwise it'd be the apocalypse already oh okay so that's that's the reason why we're still here is that they haven't released the fourth one otherwise it was gonna all be over in 2012. but like they just missed their deadlines and damn they're under a very stressful environment mark down here it wasn't working okay markdown file makes sense Trello GitHub discussions none of this seems I mean that seems a little strange I don't even know what Miro is uh it's like a collaborative uh board where you can like drag sticky notes and it's real time it's like Google Docs basically kind of thing okay okay more maybe closer to Trello yeah yeah except like instead of being it's like freeform more like a whiteboard online interactive whiteboard basically okay okay cool apparently people use base camp nice yeah they don't believe in types over at base camp they do not they do not believe in those no they don't exist all right let's see what's synchronously would come on and talk to you about it that would be so fun who dhh I cannot imagine he would come on to this I I practically ratioed him in a tweet and he did not respond I know that's why but I'm still saying it would be fun I I would do it you'd give them the best treatment out of anybody I would he disagrees with him because he's he's you know people don't like him so much that it feels they can't have a conversation with him I'd give him the best possible chance dhh if you're listening I'd give you the best possible chance to defend yourself just smack me [Laughter] which communication tools do you use regularly over the past year and which do you want to work with over the next year so this is for what they're referring to as synchronous tools so slack is definitionally an asynchronous tool unless if they're specifically meaning hangouts or whatever they call those little huddles that's what they're calling I was gonna say maybe it feels synchronous because my whole computer locks up when I open it it's synchronous because it's electron I got nothing else going on while it's loading up Microsoft teams I am shocked this many people use Microsoft teams that's a lot and then pours like Zoom Google me Google me you know WhatsApp that is weird I have never a telegram that can't be useful signal just for like work what like do you do you work at a money laundering crypto firm because that's the only people I can imagine using signal guys we can't have them know that uh we don't actually have any of the money in crypto that we said we've had for the past three years and we can't have the government listening to our conversation so we're all on Signal we gotta insta delete the messages otherwise coffee's illa is Gonna Get Us oh no uh Cisco WebEx teams nice nice now we're talking zulup isn't that what the rust team uses to organize all their great communication skills for the rust foundation and rust project yeah I've seen it in a few open source communities neovins got one that like are like uh there's the tree sitter people use it but I'm not sold on it it feels like a fire hose of stuff okay I yeah I've never used it uh I I've just never heard of the rest cool fire core cool fire core when you want to be part of the cool kids you're like yeah what's up fellow kids I've got a new synchronous chat application called cool fire core core what is the primary opposite operating system in which you work all right let's see what we got here Windows okay that's not surprising if you go worldwide it's true worldwide work at companies yeah so I'd say that what this says to me with Mac being this dominant is that we must have like a heavy I'm not sure what country uses Windows the most but I've been told by statistics of some companies that India uses the most windows so I don't know if that's true by uh by uh by percentages or the Silicon Valley Mac OS I used to that I use Windows at my first job you did yeah big Enterprise place like all your code just run somewhere else you don't run anything locally like it doesn't matter you can't run it it's not possible blah blah something something Docker ouch something something no we didn't have Docker we just had literally a huge server Farm downstairs that like was where you deployed things with different staging environments so you just didn't have the capability of running it so then it was like well Windows is cheap and affordable and uh provides good user like management stuff right so it makes sense for a big okay you know a big one yeah Ubuntu that's a little surprising oh you're the Linux desktop is it happening is it happening I mean we're it's gonna overtake Mac OS potentially yeah and then if you think about it all the other maidenless versions like Debian other Linux based one Arch Linux Fedora in it yeah Linux BSD that's surprising actually what you're referring to is gnun canoe uh which I've recently taken up Haiku not even sure Solaris isn't Haiku the like uh the Linux variant that runs on the Mac stuff like they made or no that's Asahi or whatever I don't know I don't remember they got a bunch of they're like all these people spending like a million hours trying to get Linux run on Mac yep don't know any of this okay thanks for holding my uh coffee cup appreciate that anytime do you want a little bit more here again I just pour some out of the thermos yeah you could go for it here we go could you get it okay thank you there you go all right by the way if there's a coffee sponsor out there that wants to get in front of a lot of software developers you know where to talk are you okay there look at this right now think if you are a coffee sponsor in front of 2300 people who find looking at a stack Overflow survey entertaining I mean this is your mom anything they'll buy anything come on chat tell them how much you would buy right now how many units of coffee we talking right now just yeah you know in grams yeah can I get your Gram weight of coffee you'd buy it right now 786 yep nice yeah that's a lot of Revenue yeah imagine that could be you right now Network Chuck and or commuter or someone else with whom May potentially or Costco Kirkland hey hey I'm an executive affordability okay I'm an executive Costco member okay PHP Max int dollars a month dollar okay oh crap I've lost my position where am I that was close uh that's there we go stackless overflow okay so AI search tools by the way do you use much of AI search tools I don't use a lot of oh did I die because did you die or did I die I don't know I'm back now okay I'm here with me now why don't you start over again okay um I don't really know why they call them AI search tools it's kind of weird to call like most of the AI tooling that I use isn't really involved around like search you know what I mean no go on uh well like I wouldn't consider chat GPT like a primarily a Search tool right like it's a reasoning engine like I use it to talk to and like provide reasoning and I'll paste context in and other things like that right so I don't um yeah like I don't I just don't really consider it like search like I do like Google yeah what's that one that everyone's been using that it's like it is a search engine chat tell us right now there's like someone who keeps telling me infinity or something like that yeah that's right it's pH it's like yeah yeah fine diesel yeah yeah yeah yeah finned fine there you go but the thing but like yeah I mean well we can talk about later I don't want to Shell too much Cody yeah well like we're working on one at my day job yeah they reached out to me and wondering if I would like to promote it oh nice that's cool I haven't responded I guess you are yeah I I guess I I might I maybe hashtag ad well I'm not necessarily for particularly Cody but what I'd like to see with more of the search tools is like finding ways to provide additional context like that's what I where I think llms like shine a lot better is when you give them additional like context about the question that uh you want answered right so I think it's kind of a little bit like then it's more of a search in some ways I don't know I just wouldn't really call it search but I use I use like AI tools quite a bit okay okay people are saying uh by the way go to response numbers to me I I don't know they're the same thing yeah do you really do people really care I guess so okay up here we'll go to responses for now all right so let's do this AI search tools which AI powered search tools to use regularly over the past year and which do you want to work with over the next year so Chad Jiffy I'm surprised that many people are using it I used it once for python I had to make some graphs so I was just like all right make me some graphs and I'm like it was a nice experience uh it aired a few times and you know what I realized is after about the two and a half hours I spent making the graph the way I wanted I probably could have spent about an hour just reading a few documentations and I would have been done pretty quick yeah then I would know how to do it and I wouldn't have to go back to chat Jeopardy to make me learn how to do it because every time I got an error I was like so deep in the script that I just kept you know pasting it back in and making it work and I realized am I being like super inefficient here yeah I think that that's like a problem with the current iteration of like a lot of these AI chat tools is they don't have enough context to answer the questions well that you want and like in the style and with the other libraries that you're using and all this other stuff right like if you have it over your Works code base you don't want to just like add five new libraries because that's what chat GPT decided was the good one right like you should use the ones with the versions that you have yeah yeah that's actually a good point uh also surprised Bing AI I just assume everybody's trying to get it uh to convince them to leave their wife for being AI yeah I figure that's just the people who need a break from work and they're like maybe I can get Bing to freak out again how do we poke it what do we do okay so first off I don't know who Andy is but I love that there's an AI Andy now react Andy there's a react Andy there's a chat Andy and now there's an AI Andy this is fantastic this is just fantastic if others please specify other obviously an AI correlated this look that's really bad you're supposed to do that field say the others he just just right specify all right AI developer tools so okay which AI power developer tools do you use regularly over the past year again Chad Jeopardy kind of strange uh so copilot and tab nine those are probably the ones I expected the most to happen code whisper have you tried code Whisperer haven't tried it yet although I did recently remove co-pilot and I felt no like noticeable difference in like my day-to-day thing I just removed it recently because I I'm working on some stuff for work and uh Cody and so I like removed it so that I could test the stuff that I'm doing and like most time I have it off because I'm not finished and I haven't I haven't I've noticed literally no difference in what I'm doing I really truly it for one thing at this point which is like I have a struct and I just need to like just put the variables that I've already written up here into the output format and I'm just like too lazy to type it at that point yeah or like you have you've written three if statements and like you've got some default return that you're writing for each one it's like I got you yeah but for a bunch of those why laugh is like uh well a bunch of them I think you get basically the same completion from your LSP so it's like not that much of a big win and then the second thing is if you're using uh Vim or any of them by the way you can use control X control L to complete the line and you can complete the whole line right so like there's just built in already completion so for a bunch of the kinds of things where I'm like oh I just want to complete this whole line again well I just complete the whole line because it's been built into my editor since like before I was born that's pretty reasonable I actually have no idea what control X or control what L does you help ends completion you'll like it there's a bunch of good ones in there TJ do you want to do a series where you help me uh make my event better actually listen on like when I send you DMs no we would do it live and you would just tell me oh okay yeah yeah that way then that seems good the DMS are live you know it's just us oh so chat can shame you when you don't do what I say yes okay all right admired versus desired here you go this is the one that you're interested in and they changed it from like loved and hated or whatever okay too admired and desired yeah sometimes I stay awake at night and I just sit there and desire any of them knowing that I fully I can't do anything about it all right hold on let's first go my top favorite things you know I'm just thinking like wow George Washington or like Martin Luther King Jr or like Neo them you know it's just like it the things I really admire in this life yep yep exactly it's like do I try to kiss my wife or do I go and try to get the next plug-in for neovan you know the desire really is just a hard one to kind of get get going here okay so I can't relate yeah sorry chess a bunch of they're a bunch of tarnished they don't they don't understand uh all right so this is a very confusing diagram yes apparently nobody desired flow but a lot of people admired Flo well point two percent well can we scroll up to say for the words no no point two percent desired it 25 admire it I don't get it though I don't what are the words what does it say at the very top section right this one this is the question admired though okay I'm saying okay okay let's look at that okay they had like an eight paragraph explanation I escape right it's classic maybe the documentation uh all right in addition to reporting what popular Technologies developers use in the past year we have some technologies tools that developers are currently using and they know they want to use again in the future this year we've added a new section to the survey results for technology trends for those who have used or want to use programming languages tools environments libraries etc etc there should be two etc for it to be a proper Etc uh that we have dubbed admired and desired uh to better gauge hype versus reality we've created a visual visualization that shows the distance between the proportion of respondents who want to use the technology desired and the portion of users that have used the same technology in the past year and want to continue to use it admired ah okay so desired is only those who don't use it but want to versus no device are using it and then still want to use it next year okay got it okay okay so right now JavaScript wow has a lot more people admiring it wanting to use it next year than actually Desiring it why is there is there no place that exists where there's more oh yeah okay okay yeah so admire always has to be greater than desired in this case okay I wonder do they have like an inverse later on where it's how many people currently use them like use something and do not wish to continue the opposite of desired verses admired right like maybe that's the next one worked with versus want to work with maybe that's the next one working with versus do not wish to continue to work with right like what's the one where you're working with it and you don't want to work with it in the future all right anyways yeah uh so JavaScript obviously number one python has more people admiring it nice but less people necessarily using it typescript exact same thing I think once you start using typescript you find the curve of disillusionment or it's not necessarily as great as you were hoping it to be yeah I don't even understand see it how do you how do you admire HTML these words are so weird why did they not pick two different words that have real meanings for what they're talking about nobody knows all right so C C's I mean I guess C is not super surprising right that people who use it kind of want to keep on using it versus people just want to learn it because they always have it in their head that's that is this this language that you use the Gray beard problem you talked about earlier it's so weird that like it feels like people who are writing PHP today still maybe there's people stuck at like big Enterprise places writing PHP or something but it seems like the people who are using PHP today are just like killing it yeah you know like they're just like oh I just shipped with laravel and I'm like really happy and like everything works just fine I never have to think about all this dumb stuff that the javascripters have to think about so how is it only at 40 percent that's that is a good that okay so that is actually a good point also could you say that the inverse of desired would be 91 of people who responded with currently working with PHP do not wish to continue to work with it okay let me scroll back up I gotta read this again I'm getting confused okay so desire let's see so so so desired is the proportion of respondents who want to use a technology desired and the proportion of users that have used the same technology in the past year and want to continue using it admired you've been doing it backwards dang it so that's what I'm saying like admired should be people who have been using PHP in the last year and want to keep using it yes right so that seems kind of weird because it's like I just expected more people to be enjoying PHP who are currently using it this isn't have touch PHP ever and hate it obviously if you touch PHP in 2003 you know then maybe you would hate it right that's like different yeah okay okay hold on let me just read this one more time just so we're not getting a good call a good call we created a visualization that shows the distance between the proportion of respondents who want to use the technology desired and the proportion of users who have used the same technology in the past year and want to continue using it okay so it does seem like you could have a reverse like it would have been possible to have desired be more than admired in fact it should it should actually happen quite regularly especially with something like rust right because rust there should be more people okay so admired are people who are using it and want to continue using it versus right the proportion of people who want to start using okay so it's design okay so desired must be out of all respondents only 30 of people want to use rust in the future versus 84 of people who are currently using rust want to continue to use rust that's correct that's a big spread wow um yeah okay that's confusing Zig not look at Lua though doing pretty good people want to keep writing Lula well less than less than half you know we're gonna be real here yeah but look at all the people that aren't don't want to write their languages though it's true I mean there is elixir I guess people I mean Elixir has a high retained ability so would you say that as this number goes up you actually have more people being retained in the language yeah that means that you really like it if you have a high admired and you want to keep working in it and if there's a big spread that means that the hype hasn't caught up right because it's like oh you okay so only five percent of people think oh I want to write Elixir next year but like 75 percent of people riding Elixir like it so that probably means maybe you maybe you're missing out on something maybe you should be checking out Elixir the interest you should be calling up Shy Rye yeah shy Rye in the chat okay so that means rust has the most admired right yeah I think so oh but that also means that I should learn Raku Raku I don't want to learn the random sales force language people loving Apex you know what I mean right old camel not bad where's oh camera where are you okay it's up a little bit okay okay it has it has a higher and uh admiration rating than Lua yeah and like a lot of other languages here okay not not the worst we're gonna change that perspective though I think we are way up there wow there's just so many like elixir is huge Zig is really good I think if you have a 70 that is pretty incredible yeah closure closure we read some closure recently make you admire it no I didn't I neither desired nor admired closure closure is trash okay what about Ruby yeah where is Ruby okay groovy okay people should not be admiring that uh aprily the third of people said I still want to do this after doing it said I could do that again I'm also surprised okay so this can't be right this makes no sense everyone who writes Haskell writes it for a lifetime it's like a monogamous language there's some fake news here because it's like pick gets made fun of every day for Haskell and he's still like there's nothing so become the program and you're just like oh okay only 50 of them like it that doesn't make any sense I don't believe it at all don't believe it at all uh same with go go actually is pretty high which I'm which I'm a bit surprised by oh by the way I heard the funniest term that I think you need to include in the new repertoire yeah from uh TS oding or t-soding however you like to say his name you say it's coding coding um voting comp soy [Laughter] functional languages cop soy languages instead of cop sign languages I really like it I think I need to get it into my into my uh vernacular Yeah Yeah by vernacular if you will cop soy interesting all right so here is a bunch of databases I don't really care don't care I don't know how anyone can really admire a database it's weird it's just like it should just be called continue like instead of admire because all you're saying is I just want to use it again next year yeah I mean because that's the big thing is it's like I have to use the database there's not a choice in that so I guess I'm gonna use one which one do I just use I'm so sqlite I'll just use sqlite boom yeah move on weird that's just a weird one Cloud platforms this also seems strange right like you're hosting it somewhere which one do you which one do you like or which one do you dislike the least look at versel holy cow versel is killing it they're the most the second most admired next to hetzner oh nice that's cool classic I've actually never heard of hetzner what what is Hester's uh kind of like Lynn node sorta they do more like lenode style deployment things like but I don't know exactly the pricing model and stuff they're cheap they're cheap hosts kind of things all right and do you think that Amazon it just has such a high desired rating because everyone just wants to become a devopser like what's what's the what's the purpose why are people yes if you have to pick one and you were like I know that I need to get on a platform I guess when you just be like I guess I just pick AWS like that's the one that I'd want to do yep yep okay that makes sense I would ex I would expect that though this number this admired number to be a like on the other side yeah but probably a lot of them are like coming from Google Google cloud or somewhere else so they were like oh this was terrible and AWS like at least it's it's not gonna shut down the service on me okay okay web Frameworks and Technologies oh Phoenix shy Rye are you here should I ride you hear this shy right okay so I wonder if this admired will go down I wonder if like you you have to measure because every two years reacts change its mind about what should be done and then a bunch of people get upset like I wonder if in the off years this number would go down and then goes back up as everyone has now relearned the new way and then goes back down oh I've been seeing a lot of people upset about react server components like in the last you know like it's climbing because people like a lot of library maintainers and stuff because it just keeps on changing or there's bugs or other stuff I don't know be interesting to see what happens it is and again they put node.js and react into the same thing yeah that totally makes sense I use them for exactly the same stuff yeah yeah they're kind of interchangeable I know some people that like to use node.js instead of react you know it's just pick your poison you know I got the SSR isg incremental static return propagations going on with both of them so it's kind of whichever one you like yep yep absolutely I actually was just telling my wife that the other day um all right so where's Phoenix wow people love penis but nobody knows what Phoenix says okay quick question let's go back up to Elixir okay how many people wanted to learn elixir 4.45 of those the same amount almost the same amount wanted to learn Phoenix yeah pretty high overlapping right there yep makes sense uh Phoenix is some I know Phoenix has something to do with Elixir and and the ability to like it's kind of like the default uh like oh Elixir framework yeah kind of like laravel kind of idea okay so Phoenix is the laravel of elixir so I think that that's a pretty fair way to sail though I'm sure everybody involved with all those languages and projects regardless of which side just got offended the pH people PHP people are like man that was ridiculous oh well I'm gonna go back and then that's the end of their fan self with money [Music] oh time to get in my Lambo see you guys um all right okay so react to JS uh not necessarily admired as much to say node.js it's also cool to see something like svelte being so high wow yeah that is really big it's kind of crazy too because you think about it it's just like that's a really big percentage and but just felt just kind of is just crushing it and it's not that big of a project like it was just kind of like random a little bit ago you know what I mean yeah it wasn't well known and same with solid.js solid.js is also really really high okay so people like to use that I mean I've been using a little bit of solid.js and Netflix uh for one of the tools by the way by the way I work at Netflix if you didn't know and honestly a lot of projects from the ground up using react and solid.js is just easier I swear it just makes me less hate my life then wait till you get to hdmax though that's going to be on this list next year and crushing it oh I cannot wait the htmx curve is gonna happen so good oh it's a hockey stick gear baby it's a hockey stick year it is everyone loves uh what's it called um what's it called View everyone I hear talk about views seems so popular but I'm surprised that the admiration for it is lower than react which I never hear people talk super positive well I mean theotalk Super positive but everybody else seems to talk super positive about View It's gotta be some of these have gotta be just getting crushed by people working at an Enterprise for some of them you know they just got like view 1.037 stuck on or something I have no idea what version view is on but it's like yeah you say they got some weird dinosaur version which is nothing like View and now they're just like forever well you see Tom was using view so we know we have to keep using thank you interesting okay that's crazy okay other Frameworks and libraries again we're gonna go into this weirdness again just just skip it okay Swift UI is the highest rated of them that's that's Tori oh that's Tori my bad my bad also really confusing that this graph goes from zero to eighty percent they really shouldn't have normalized it that makes it really hard in the 90s all right well people love tari maybe that's that makes sense that's the reason why I get that question so often also I'm very surprised about.net I'm still just shocked that C sharp I guess when you re when you measure C sharp against numpy and Kafka C sharp or dot net five is amazing the common comparison it's a common comparison whenever I'm thinking about comparing I always think uh maybe what is the difference between Cuda and electron like who wants to know which one more hey we should just change apples and oranges to Cuda and electron but you just you're kind of measure include an electron right now which could could be put on the same list when you really think about it um all right other tools all right hold on other tools uh which developer tools for compiling building and testing have you have extensive uh development working over the last past year okay so Docker still I'm surprised because Docker like once you if you start using it for Dev can be quite the pain in the ass I'm surprised that anyone admires npm I just think ideal package management solution this is what Peak Performance looks like you may not like it the PIP is somehow someone admires pip that's cool maybe they maybe it's managers they thought it was performance Improvement plan yeah I like pip Scott put all your employees on one every now and then I constantly I'm just throwing them on the Pips really gets them working hard extra hours uh fight not surprised uh just because JavaScript has been such a heap of doodoo garbage that vites the only solution that I've used that I still can't figure out how to solve the uh the uh CGS uh ecmas script module Problem whatever you call it as far as I understand it's an unsolved problem it's an unsolved I still cannot use chart js4 and have a normal common JS Pro common JS project stealth like to this day you cannot do it well why is it like this I don't nobody knows like this nobody knows this is a real professional technology it's all just jobs it's not even like it's getting composed it's just gonna be JavaScript at the end and at the end they're still just like default export and named exports it's not like these are vastly different there's just still the same crap like how haven't we figured it out oh no oh man it's emotionally painful I also it's really strange that people I mean I guess maybe it's not that strange that people admire cargo but I think it's a good package management solution and build solution yeah but when I think imagine writing C make for 15 years and then you and then you run into a Ross project or you just type cargo build okay yeah I can see that being really amazing uh but the thing that gets me kind of confused is this desired column like I get it for Docker right Docker has like things you want to desire to learn that makes sense yeah but who in the world desires npm you know what I've been really missing right now I've been I I've been using cmake I'm kind of wishing it was npm right now that's a good question who is marking down desired I guess it's just like that's basically like another way of saying I'd like to learn JavaScript okay okay yeah because I figured Docker and kubernetes would be higher like I have some I guess romantic desire to learn kubernetes as much as I have say to learn French but you know like am I gonna learn it uh you know it's a completely different story here it's both of those are the love language of my wife so I I'm working on French and kubernetes what are you learning exactly Cargo Road cargo space [Laughter] we just okay well that was the dumbest thing I've said in a long time next section I am shocked that anyone wants to learn Gradle uh can we just take a moment here and be like who wait apt apt is in this list there's like app Purge and apt install what else are you doing I'm really thinking I'd like to learn it next year I'm just really not in the headspace where I think I can wrap myself around this I got a lot on my plate this year you know I'm gonna I'm Gonna Learn npm and I just I don't think I could double up but yeah boy got room in my head for one solution at a time for installing things and then they have Nicks right here Nick's completely more confusing than bun how do you have bun and Knicks in the same list like how's this even possible I want to learn it uh bun run I guess I don't know like mix bun ninja this has to be the most confusing test of things like I've ever seen in my lifetime it is Lazarus down here is that a company uh I bet it's a run time right it's not is it I always forget if it's well there's a company wasmer IO and then there's the runtime will azamar and then there's Godot I thought that was a game programming thing what is Google test I think Google test is for C plus plus right Am I Wrong can someone can someone verify Google test for C plus no is a game engine okay I thought Godot was a game engine okay so this is genuinely the craziest language I've ever seen okay so yes so okay Google test is for C plus plus there's literally the just for C plus plus followed by the build system ninja followed by bun a runtime that uses JS core followed by NYX which apparently makes you uh break up relationships and then a game engine Godot I really don't understand any of this this is the strange it's the last one live little test what is this probably something with C plus plus or C that sounds like a c testing I really get enough respondents that they got to number 59.46 I well because remember it's a percentage right so I'd say like oh number divides into 59 that means they had to have a lot right yeah you'd have to have well I don't know exactly which one it is but that's a weird number to get to okay it can't be three people can't be three people because that would that would have been you know it would have been like 66.6 two out of three continue wanting to use it but now obviously this is a way more intense number that had to be like one out of so many out of 14 maybe yeah I don't know that's funny all right let's see uh all right so here we go integrated development environments uh all right so vs code apparently people still love it they do but wow guess who got most admired let's go where's neovan where is neovim neovim let's go who would win 30 million dollars a year or a couple of Open Source people you know what I mean like who would win this I mean that is such a good point there is so many millions of dollars over so many years being spent on this one product and it's like you befriendel and a couple other people trying to keep up with Bram and the language changes he's doing and you're still winning yeah yeah that's pretty impressive and I do find it very funny just picturing like they you know there's some Microsoft exec who doesn't he's like just got an MBA not not like any coding stuff and reading through this response and they've got to be triggered every year when they see this what is this freaking neovan project their funding isn't one developer a year but not one developer yeah imagine that not even one developer how many people are on the vs code team do you know uh I looked it up recently I think they've got like 30-ish full-time exclusively on the editor so that doesn't count you know all the people making the python extension the typescript extensions working on time like you know what I'm saying and there's some people there that you're like holy they got one of the guys who wrote the domain I don't have the book over here I think like one of the guys who wrote The Domain modeling book like this guy's been around for a while so you know he's not only making 250k yeah yeah he's not a chief he's not a cheap guy so I think it's something like that I could look it up again because I I was trying to figure it out and they happened to mention it recently on some like live stream and I was uh very surprised wow um so again notepad plus plus still coming in with a strong admirer rate I'm really confused about this still uh and xcode having anyone admire this is shocking xcode is single I mean I'd rather use Fleet I'd rather learn he found it here you go Prime okay 28 Engineers 6 PMS 3 ux and one rider that's exclusively on uh the vs code team that's a lot of that's a lot of money right there that is a lot of money a year salaries and benefits and costs yeah wow and they still can't be the most desired or the most admired sorry admire and and then I mean nilvim has to still go over the hurdle of being Vim yeah right you you type letters and it doesn't do anything you still have the last don't do anything dang oh man okay a synchronous tools again I shocked anyone in my like I can't believe this is real When I See This that people you love that jira's getting crushed by a mark though readme.md better than jira for project management in terms of funding markdown nothing zero hundreds of Engineers it's literally just text with highlighting [Laughter] you just lost that don't you she is do you write your job we don't we don't use German no man ridiculous man and the rest of this I don't really care honestly I don't really care about a lot of this I'm curious about notion where's notion okay people kind of like notion right get up discussions also weird that it's they got GitHub projects now and they're all right that's what we use usually okay they're all right because then it's just only issues which is nice confluence you know I thought that was like a knowledge store thing it's a Wiki yeah I'm just shocked that it has that much people wanting to learn how to use it yeah continue using it you got a coin flip whether someone's like yeah I'm really ready to do Confluence again next year what are you gonna do next year I don't want to use it well I guess Trello somehow is the worst out of all the popular ones but if people would rather use Confluence than Trello wow this is strange this is very very strange is obsidian on this list right because I know there's a bunch of people that love that crap I can't I don't see it you don't see it base camp not very admired okay how what are the odds do you think that there's people that just go and fill out bad responses for everything associated with dhh because I feel like they're I feel like this is the crowd that would be like I know space camp I'm gonna say I use it and I don't want to use it again next year that's pretty reasonable okay synchronous tools again slack the asynchronous ones the old the old classic asynchronous synchronous ones all right so one quick thing to know again this line right here it can it I don't is it even 80. okay it is 80 so slack is admired 69 of the time nice you know I mean Discord slack I don't really care Discord is for memeing slack is for like you know having professional work I like that the thing I wish for slack that it did better was just like One login to all my slacks yes that the whole Slack thing but I just have lost all my old ones yeah I'm like I lost it I had one for like my local community like my town and then like I don't know where it went and I I just didn't go in often enough to feel like getting back in so it's just gone it's just gone I also think signal is again super strange that this is that people I like it I yes I like it I'll continue to use signal it's just not what I would use at my okay so to be completely Fair there are people who at my job who will only whisper me on Signal smart I I my guess is that admins can read your yeah they don't want your DMs they don't want to ever be known that they're talking to me or what they're about to say is not appropriate for to for work slack so I get a lot I do get signal messages mostly the first one I'm sure mostly the first one no very little of anything else yeah zulip people like that one and Matrix isn't Matrix super confusing is it Matrix like the Mastodon of Discord [Laughter] it's a good way s crime but it's like like it's very hard every time someone tries to explain it to me I feel stupid like I can't use technology yeah okay yep a cool fire core again High appreciation they're about to get so much if I were if I were making a Dev tool I would get all of my friends as many people as I could to fill it out inside here if it wasn't popular so that it would be on the names of this so that people look at it later yeah it's like it seems like an easy way to game this yeah because I I'm I'm over here being like do I want to use cool fire for my next project or IRC it seems like people who like IRC really appreciate it yeah yeah all right AI search tools chat Jeopardy that is okay again eighty percent there's the old 80 but still the desired is what you would expect everyone wants to use it yep because it's very novel and it's very new not that many people want to try out AI Andy feels bad man yep the candies if only Andy could be more than a meme and he could go somewhere here I've never heard of quora Poe is that like from quora the website the one that's terrible yeah I would assume this is the question and answer site that successfully is worse than stack overflow somehow it's harder to find the answer on the site do I click a link to it and I scroll down and I'm getting an answer to a different question I never got the answer to the original question I was wondering yes quora is by far the greatest piece of garbage ever created I don't even know what you.com is I assume it's a porn site and find people probably just have never heard a find but those who use it seem to like it actually more wow no slightly slightly less than chat GPT maybe anything you signed yeah maybe we should test it out because that's pretty that's pretty high admirer rate fine diesel that's a big the hype is lagging right there yeah because people who really really like it but no one really knows about it okay Elixir moment let's call that an Elixir moment again co-pilot no well it's the first flip it's flipped it's flipped flip at it look at that people actually yeah I know you're here let me do I'll do it for you it's right here flip look at this right here look at that thing people who have used it go that's pretty good but people who want to use it is actually higher is it do you think it's because it's a paywall oh yeah I don't know people get really upset about the paywall I mean I guess I'm a little bit upset because they like scraped everybody's code but uh I don't know it seems like not that much money okay you get your work to pay for it or something well I mean ten dollars American is is a touch more expensive than say Argentina yeah that's true they don't have they don't have like price match for other countries or anything I just figured GitHub would do stuff like that I just figured they wouldn't because we just people would VPN in oh I don't know I don't know I have no idea uh they don't do that well that's stupid yeah so that that might be generating the desired the hype like way over matching the you know the whatever what's the opposite of hype using happiness um okay interesting right yeah I don't think I'm like I don't think I admire co-pilot it's fine it's just like another autocomplete for me I'm not I don't think it's anything fantastic all right work with versus want to work with I think this is a big one right this is now this is understandable science ah I see now clearly obviously people who use typescript also like bash and C sharp and go what the hell is this graph so this is like the outside is what you work with right and then the there's links to what you want to work with Okay okay okay maybe let's see a lot of our top used programming languages are popular because those that use them want to use them again JavaScript typescript HTML all selected these three languages as their top three they want to use next year that didn't help me okay what's the question uh which programming language scripting and markup language have you done extensive work a development work in over the past year and which do you want to work in over the next okay all right so click on typescript okay I'm I'm clicking on it oh not the lights are still happening TJ are we Boomers shoot we're Boomers do I press the back do I press the back button or is it going to screw me up don't press the back button they can't handle it I can't handle it do I repress typescript oh you repress typescript so does that just make it go away this is very accessible what the hell is this thing Okay so no I don't know okay so now you can see the connections if they don't have the other ones what I I think what I understand is that PHP really is C Sharp it only works with itself [Music] I'm staying here boys nope never mind but there is people who work with C sharp let's see people who work with C sharp and oh my goodness I think I understand it okay okay look at this so a lot I can't read anything okay a line to yourself means people who work with PHP and want to continue to work with PHP yup yup yup yup so if we have here let's just turn off uh Colin Deez Nuts let's turn off C sharp let's turn off C let's turn on Okay so people who work with Bash want to work with typescript in a bit of typescript people want to work with bash but they mostly just would rather work with themselves if you throw in Rust a lot of Bashers want to go with rust okay you can see that none of us people want to work with typescript is that what that means I think let's get the trash one out get click click away on the bash so we just see these two there's is there nobody let me redo that bash well just to make sure yeah because there is a line going from typescript to bash and there's a line from bash going to typescript but there is literal roster must have any line okay so okay so okay so Russ doesn't want to work with python either is it just rust is like no I refuse a hundred percent of rust station I just wanted to write rust station again yep it doesn't want to work with C doesn't want to work with C sharp Khalid and rust have no overlap and people who use kotlin don't want to use kotlin they don't okay PHP people who use PHP do not use rust Powershell nope what about Powershell and PHP nice look at this we found three islands wow okay yep uh what about C plus plus eup what about go nope HTML still rust nothing Java nothing JavaScript nothing python nothing rust is the only language to work purely by itself wow wow that oh that's because oh camel's not on here it's okay okay almost not on here you're right yeah but like these all are going this way but wait so so like highlight the rest one nine thousand do we know what the total number of rust people is like if you highlight rust does it say like just at the bottom no just says how can we find out the number I think I have to go back up to hold on this is just like the greatest graph I've ever seen in my lifetime I like it foreign it's always at the bottom of these is it I thought it was at the top with the I thought is it not at the top I don't know I've seen percentage scores there we go here we go here we go look this is people who are learning to code right oh yeah because we need to go to the desired section is that it I don't know I I don't I just don't really okay yeah they're different questions so they don't have to add up I was just trying to figure out on look 8 000 people said they use rust well the 9000 said it later so that seems a little suspicious stack Overflow did they say that later well it said 9480 of the people who used respawn to write rust again okay hold on let me has this guy never heard a search well I'm afraid to use it on this site I don't know what's happening here oh yeah you're right 9674 people who use rust want to keep working with rust you are filtered foreign we're going we're gonna get there oh okay here we go all right Phil we're almost there chat all right you're right all respondents rust dang it went back to percentages again responses we're almost there professional software 11 000 people okay so there you go hold on okay so 11 427 let's go down here and where were the other people they were all for other languages that aren't on the list or something or what they are all wanting to write oh camel they were like Russ was a mistake we should have stuck with oh camel hot on okay so Han 84.66 so 11 427 times 0.8846 equals 10 000 coding after equals ten thousand one hundred and eight and yet somehow based on this whole admired business only 9 000 of them who work with Russ want to work again their percentages aren't even correct because remember admired is those who currently not Virgo there's no one who's writing rust who's thinking Hmm you know maybe I could ship this a little bit faster no no one thinks that no one wait and there's no go to go yeah there's go to go okay oh okay all right all right you go to go got it it's kind of like they want to stop is rust staying where they are the Vim of programming languages uh it seems more like the Helix in programming languages okay so they are saying okay so someone's telling me that there is a minimum oh minimum of 5 000 respondents per connection oh so they just couldn't find 5 000 people to go yeah so of the people who work with rust there is no other language which garnered at least 5 000 people yeah okay I guess that makes sense because they only had 11 000 people total right so it's like that'd have to be half the people that's kind of stupid I don't know wouldn't half the people also want to learn anything else right like HTML like they're still if they're gonna do front end they're still doing you know if they're gonna do like was and front ends stuffs they're still up to no HTML yeah they remove the noise I guess yep I feel like they should have done percentile of the things or something like anything less than 10 right because then it would have been it would have made sense to keep it for rust you'd still get to see oh ten percent so 15 of Russ people actually still want to write python for some stuff yeah you know because they want to actually do some data science and like get it done this week so they're gonna do it in Python but that seems weird and well they had five thousand for a connection to be oh five pay to be on the graph yeah a minimum minimum 5K respondents per connection yeah per connection yeah not just to be on the graph yeah I'm surprised that half the rust developers don't want to learn typescript there's no way because like sometimes you wanna you wanna write it and go like milk is here we have to be honest like yeah sometimes you do just want to write it and go how's your brother doing by the way have you talked to him yeah I was just talking to him on the stream he was causing a bunch of drama between rust and go and I told him keep it up buddy he didn't cut any drama between rust and go Russ causes its own drama okay Russ gets up there I did see I did see some people who are like talking about how Russ was still super admired and they're like see the drama doesn't do anything and I'm like well you know a bunch of the results were done before the latest round of drama like it's not like they went back and fixed the response actually um stack Overflow let's send an email I don't admire rust anymore because I do love that there is rust global and everyone's upset because it's in America very U.S eccentric yeah well it's because they didn't even say USA they just said like Bellevue WA I think it just felt like oh everyone should just know that that's Washington duh you know like that kind of thing and then right afterwards they're like by the way great conference in China and no one's like hey wait a second there's a lot of human rights violations going on over there don't they have millions of people currently in like in prison camps no one not a single one of them that died over Bellevue Washington being offensive yeah couldn't handle the fact when I checked last it was only three hours long that can't that still can't be right yeah I think it's funny yeah uh all right here we go all right so I don't care about any of these graphs these graphs honestly just don't even mean anything to me I don't think I don't care about Cloud platforms anyways well it's just weird to have these like these kind of connections right okay what Frameworks probably is more interesting right that one could be fun yes it'll be fun spring boot is by itself nobody wants to learn spring Boot and spring boot only wants to be with spring boot we got the same problems as the rust land except kind of reverse you attract everyone who uses asp.net doesn't want to use asp.net anymore they want to get on core they want to get on the court in court they only want to keep using core what's the angular crew like let's see angular okay angular uh they want to learn node.js okay once again can they eliminate the dumb answers from these that doesn't even make sense what does that mean oh I see angular wants to be angular with itself and angular also wants to wait people no people who use node.js also want to learn angular so angular is its own Island no it also connects a little bit to react there's a little bit over there oh there's a tiny sliver okay yeah yeah okay so people any reactors going to angular or no no no reactor is going to angular reactors none it looks like react people want to go to svelte they want to go to they're like we'll do anything besides react except and English but we have signals now we have signals everyone's like no that's funny yeah Django's pretty happy chilling they're like I'm I'm good I'm good I don't really like people spring boots like me too wanna be friends no no no sucks [Laughter] this is so funny wait this felt everyone who's using svelte doesn't want to use look at that it's felt they just want to go to these other platforms they don't want to well that seems so weird because it's like this felt wants to learn node okay so that what they can write their back end in js2 I guess yeah but they just didn't have 5 000 people who wrote that they also wanted to learn svelt I don't know but but angular is actually good though okay yeah I know don't worry we get it angular you and six thousand other people yup you and six thousand other people love your opinion oh all this felt people want to stay I think but there's a bunch of other people who want to go to spelled because it's not the stuff oh oh yes okay people who work with three guys go okay yes and people who okay they really gotta get rid of node.js node.js just makes no sense Express makes no sense xjs doesn't make any sense I mean xjs is just react right am I wrong with that it's it's react the framework actually react is now an xjs is what I've been reading lately online yeah react is now next year yes like what does this mean why are people who worked with nexjs want to go work with react like that that line does it it doesn't make any sense well here wait hold okay they probably could have done a lot of stuff on nexjs and never actually learned react okay okay okay I can buy it okay Yep looks like view is also another one of these islands people who like view just want to keep being viewed and people who are using react just want to go back over to view all right so let's just get rid of all this I made a mistake mom please forgive me yeah all right so let's just get rid of all these ones I just want to see it all right so I'm just trying to understand this relationship here so it looks like they're just really intertwined but when you throw a node.js it just ruins everything weird oh I guess people okay so this kind of makes sense people who want to know nexjs want to know node.js that would make sense because nexjs is also known they want to write their back and a node right so it's like they want to learn that that makes sense okay yep all right it's still just weird to include here because it's kind of like yeah well we get it you want to be able to learn back and that's fine but it's not really like comparing Alternatives yeah because react plus node.js is next Js this is just one big gigantic Circle turn I don't know what's happening here okay next is react plus Express oh okay yep see the same the same thing happens here did you know you can write react in okay moldo you can't but did you know that people who write angular want to keep writing angular I did know that yeah I was aware it's really good by the way it's really good though Keck w let's see there's 4650 okay so more people who know angular want to learn node versus how many people who know node want to learn angular okay neat that was a fun graph is there anything else that we need to know of I don't care about any of this because this is again that graph remember when we talked about please don't show this one I don't even want to see it we're going to ruin the video we're gonna ruin the video Hold on we're gonna let's just what was the one what was the ones we said Cuda oh yeah I'm well I do want to you can't compare those that's like comparing Cuda and electron you're right look at that you there they are separate they're different no one who knows Cuda wants to know electron and vice versa vice versa they're just not into each other rather learn electron to be honest yes again this graph it makes no sense why how is Visual Studio solution and Docker and Homebrew and pip and terraform there's so Horse no one wants to learn Visual Studio Solutions it's not like my goals for 2024. all right well I want to be a better dad I'm hoping to get a raise and I'm really hoping I finally understand Visual Studio Solutions XML here I come I do like gnu it's just like yep like this is exactly what I would expect along with Ms build right they're just like yeah where this is what we do this is all we do all right uh is there anything else we want to look at nice this is the editors let's see it okay so this is Visual Studio code people there's a lot of arrows okay so let's get rid of uh Android Studio let's get rid of xcode because obviously everyone in xcode is trying to go to visual studio code yeah uh Sublime no I didn't pay for it Visual Studio let's drop that one notepad plus plus exceptionally confusing notepad plus plus there's not even that they just don't even that big percentage that wanted to use something else all right neofamers just want to work with neovim and people and people who use vs code just want to come over to the neovins side let's go we're shrinking that percentage let's go let's go let's go that is good uh not surprising everyone that uses Nano wants to go to an easier editor vs code yeah they're like maybe I could actually close this Nano is harder than Vim it is I don't know why people don't understand this it is it is the hardest of them all okay so Jupiter notebook is kind of strange to have on there I'm not really sure what to make of it okay interesting look look at this then people want to leave them for visual studio interesting and no Vim to Neo of him no because they probably just already switched if they wanted wait are there vs code people who want to go to Vim is that what that one line is yeah this is uh wait yeah right here oh interesting how many is that uh 9 800. my guess is that those people that want to go to Vim don't understand the difference between neovim and Vim or if there is that is that is sometimes the confusion on this like you sometimes wish in a sense that they would group them because in a lot of ways they're entertaining like I usually tell people I use them by the way you know if they're not like in because it's a little confusing to explain what technically I use a fork of them yes like that's that's real and someone said they're also confusing Vim motions oh that could be as well as well yeah that's a huge one because I know people are like oh I use Vim I'm like oh you doing they're like vs code yeah and vs code I'm like well I'm not really like them different you're using motions interesting okay yeah I would like to see this if they could redo with vim and neovim as one category and just called them because I also just say I use vim and In This Crowd right here whenever that happens people are like Oh you mean neovib and I'm like yeah but you're not normies okay yeah right the other thing too I don't I didn't do the survey this year so I'd be interested to see uh how the like how it's laid out in the options like sometimes they have you write them in and people write them instead of neovim which is understandable because you wanted to go to the the group but that's good we'll see yep yep it was still a lot I mean I can't believe ten percent like a solid 10 of developers use neovim you know what I mean that's crazy remember 10 on stack overflow that has to be like double yeah if you can get 10 even if it's not like I'm just saying 10 like you can get 10 of developers using a product that you work on that is wild yeah that is pretty wild yeah all right asynchronous tools no one actually cares about that it just makes none of this makes any sense these ones it doesn't even matter that it's gonna change every day yeah yeah this doesn't matter co-pilots the smiley face nice job yeah right and code whisper wants to go over here and oh some people from copilot want to try out tab nine tab nine was pretty cool tab nine was actually fairly novel it did some pretty good line completion I liked tab 9 they actually did a better I thought they did a better job all right so here we go here's the big one top paying jobs there you go Zig people are literally getting paid to use zig some there's one guy who's making a hundred three thousand six hundred eleven dollars sorry [Laughter] you're actually so right that is so good that is so good oh my goodness is there like a uh number of responses okay hold on number of responses wait 273 wow wow it's that's actually pretty high that's half as popular as early which is a 15th as popular as a movie sharp really yeah I have Sharps up their way high look at Ruby goby look at just a little air that makes sense closure is usually really really high up there because there's a lot of uh financial institute kind of things yep yeah look at look at oh camel oh camels also but oh camel loses to go yeah this is one of those where you think like okay that's because no one's looking for oh camel answers on uh on stack Overflow I can tell you pretty confidently the average salary at Jane Street does not look like whatever the number is that they have right there yeah Jane Street the very wealthy company probably not looking at 91 000. yeah yeah they're not paying that in New York I'll tell you why okay very interesting though it's it's also interesting that rust is so low that is who is getting hired to write rust for not lots of money yeah because it doesn't even make sense you know what I'm saying like why would you pick rust if anything because this is the average this should be right this is the average this is not the median right um you'd think it's got to be it has to be the average which means that it gets disproportionately affected by outliers there's not going to be a lines went bankrupt that's a good call Chuck okay Block's a good call okay but but you know because you would assume that it's going to be some sort of like Alpha Beta curve right where it's gonna be like a huge amount in something and then a long tail so like the averages are super screwed up in comparison to the median is weird because it's like for rust the reason that you would want to do it is probably you have something that needs to be really high performance it says mediability it says media okay interesting it's still it's hard for me to believe right so like what's the point of picking rust if you're if you don't have those things which should mean that you're making a bunch of money at your company right like that you really need High availability and high performance like what would be the purpose yeah rust equals broke go woke go broke rust exactly Lua is almost paying as much as rust and it's easier yes all the Roblox Developers it's actually M Lula uh all right well that's pretty cool I am shocked APL is on here typescript this is this one's so scuffed though because like who's going on here and putting their real salary and all this stuff and it's just this one seems such like a fake just a fake response one yeah because for the zig when I said I'm currently writing Zig and I did 69 690 420 dollars but there's only 200 and some of us on this list so I'm skewing it by at least one position over [Laughter] [Music] assembly there's no way I'm believing your writing assembly for 77 000 median there's just no way I'm believing that number right like that just doesn't even make any sense or c that's funny uh solidity not surprising Dart oh no oh no not like this Dart if so here's there are so many ways that people are missing out on gamifying stack Overflow survey like if you have a tier two Lang and now I'm saying like that it's bad like Zig is clearly a tier two laying in terms of like yeah opportunities to get a job maybe even tier three like realistically I would put zigged here and it's like if you have that and you're not getting all of your friends who are part of the language like team that are making bank at some company to go fill this out and make sure that you get top it's stupid because you can now you know I can guarantee you there's a thousand YouTube videos coming out a day right now what's the most the highest paying language on a hashtag survey this year and then it's like you'll never guess and it's gonna be Zig yeah and then a bunch of people are gonna like pick door and Zig because they think that this somehow means that it's their chance to make making a bunch of money right and so then if you're not doing that and like a bunch of these other things you're basically just uh throwing away free advertising it is it's truly free advertising yeah interesting okay let's see how let's look at this okay hold on see there's these are the median sellers does this one really say median hold on yeah wait where does let's see oh is this paragraph you have that problem where you don't read the whole thing okay okay okay okay oh yep yep that is that was me not reading the whole thing okay so this one has median salary for all response and let's see uh increase ten percent and increased 11 okay so look at that year over year things went up I don't know what sass is uh Dart all right Colin going up jobs it's been like the business Lang thingy I guess I don't know I don't I don't I don't know what it is okay uh Swift went up PHP has gone up PHP must definitely suffer from outliers okay there's definitely some outliers in the PHP world uh yeah Taylor we're coming for you Java I'm also surprised by this one uh just because a lot of the people I know that are writing like back ends in Java they're making a lot of money yeah they're working at the bank like literally yeah they're literally at the bank just depositing money every day uh see I guess maybe not some of the embedded jobs don't pay very well yeah Shy's got a good point where it used to let you select like by country and continent Global salary meeting is such a weird number yeah I guess that's true we know that it's Global you can stop saying yeah they said you get it we're getting we're globalist okay this is a global list I get it yeah what you put your lists locally no I only use Global one so I can allocate them once yeah duh uh Ruby way out there I'm still shocked at how much Ruby's doing Haskell look at Haskell go it's because the Ruby people they just make websites that work and sell things it's so it's just like they just do Ruby on Rails they finish their website in the day and then they're done yeah also surprising Matlab they're just putting Rockets into space and they're getting paid the least they're like what do you do I make rocket science what do you get paid the least out of all the developers except for Dart yeah let's go oh camel nice where is O camel oh yeah oh camel okay oh camel's doing really good yeah it's just shocking I would like if you would have asked me what jobs pay the most median I would not have said JavaScript or typescript just because an X percentage of them probably what 40 are within the first year of their career so that just makes a lot of them there's a huge there's a huge left shift to it but I would have just assumed rust would have been top or go or Java yeah so Matlab is drugged down by all the people in school maybe um okay interesting is there anything else uh I don't want to go into AI uh well you can skip it uh I think that's pretty much all the interesting yeah I don't really care about the rest of it honestly Community don't care yeah we're gonna advertise for stack Overflow now yeah nobody cares about stack Overflow methodology um well we asked the internet survey and then we put in the answers clearly we didn't think about it because you can totally put Docker electron and Cuda in the same category other tools um okay some people said appropriately statistically average length some some founded they felt it was a little long some felt like they just didn't get enough out of it ironically that's the shortest category as well [Laughter] it would have been so perfect if too long was too long look at it you're like what the hell is this graph all right yeah um how easy uh difficulty mom I failed the survey today a bunch of questions I should know and I just didn't know them I think I got the wrong answer I didn't have any money to copy from this time it was really hard they're like what's your favorite language and I was like I don't even know the answers weren't on stack Overflow for this one oh that's that's pretty funny okay well let's call it a day I think so that was great no problem that was a good one yeah that was a good one hey like the video obviously um true TJ finds you at tiege underscore DV on YouTube twitch right yeah and Twitter and you'll find me just making memes replying to Prime's tweets with my own self promo did you like the last one that I did I like that you're now doing it on all of them oh yeah by the way you could have learned that by simply watching this Prime tweets I can't wait to stream tomorrow so I reply oh yeah for all make sure to click here click follow and smash the notification Bell to get get a notification when it starts and then linked mine was naughty all right I'll just watch this I'll just disappear all right bye
