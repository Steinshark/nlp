ladies and gentlemen welcome back to the candidates this is a double round robin 14 Round tournament the winner of which plays for the World Chess Championship later this year first time in history we've got the men and the women playing at the same place at the same time and this is round number four out of 14 it's a very close race I will take you through all the games and if you're lucky enough to watch this recap in the first three hours that it comes out to celebrate the start of the candidates you can get some of my courses for 33% off but if you watch this video anytime beyond that you're just going to have to enjoy the games uh and wait for the next uh courses promo my friends in this round we have Banger games after Banger games I mean it's the candidates every single round is going to be exciting but we are about uh 20ish to 25% through uh with the event it's Hikaru versus Prague Hikaru two draws and a loss Prague all over the place he has one win one draw and one loss and yesterday he beat VD it with the black pieces so Hikaru shows up today and he plays E4 and prag plays E5 now yesterday in this position which is the Spanish Prague played F5 so he showed up against vided guanti and he played F5 and it was extremely complicated iaru goes back to this this time however proc says you know what I'm going to play a classical Spanish this is just the relopez now we have D3 that's already a lot of information normally what happens here is Castle and then black puts the bishop on E7 white plays for C3 and D4 it's a very committal decision by Hikaru it's already kind of taking the game one way you could take two highways to a destination sorry Europeans don't drive cars as much it's a very American thing uh I know you guys have highways I'm just saying you know Highway reference uh and very quickly from the opening we get somewhere now actually I think Hikaru must have studied prague's games because Prague has had this exact position multiple times recently and he played D6 Prague really likes to put the bishop on C5 instead of on E7 which is a little bit more passive and he's done this against multiple people including the current world champion of Chess dingly Ren in the Tata steel tournament in January of this year so Hikaru has information information in chess is everything the only thing that matters as much as skill uh and you know he probably was expecting Prague to do that but in this position Prague went here so he spent 4 minutes and he played a different move order something that actually changes the course of the game he played something that's played in less than 10% of the current position and on the very next move Hikaru went A4 so you see Hikaru spent four minutes back and I think this little Nifty move order kind of made Hikaru show what his whole point is and so they played this position now I I I could be I could be out of you know he Caro covers his own games as well but um that is what Prague played and I have a feeling hikaro was going to try to pound away at the system Prague goes here hikaro instigates on the queen side and now plays Bishop to E3 we trade the pieces and now we trade the pawns and basically white is going to try to exploit the open a file as well as the weak Square on D5 and what else white is going to try to work with is this f file so hypothetically if you know black was sorry if black was just not careful you know white would sacrifice The Rook like this is kind of what white wants right this is this is what white is trying to win the game like this uh very similar positions were reached in the world championship match be between Magnus Carlson uh and ding uh not ding uh and Yan bomi du by 2021 and Hikaru does kind of make some Preparatory moves but Prague does the same thing that Hikaru does and he he he ends up getting his own f file opened and the only imbalance here is like PG's Pawn is a bit more advanced than than hikaru's and I I honestly I hate to like end the analysis here but that's all that happened and then they just repeated moves now for Prague this is a fantastic result like a draw with black I mean like a throwaway draw with black and I mean it it only it really just happened because of this little move order Nuance like I don't exactly know what Hikaru prepared against D6 I don't know if he was going to go A4 Bishop E3 he clearly came came with something and it didn't quite work and you know again winning with white is a lot easier than winning with black especially when you have to so it's a good result for prag and Hikaru is kind of like yet to get going like we we've yet to see it because the other game that Hikaru played with white Ved gon uncork some Demon Goblin preparation and then played brilliantly so it's been a bit of a slow start for Hikaru but the good news is there are there's 10 more games so and um oh my goodness I mean some of the games today this is nurul salimova she is the uh I think she's the lowest rated and youngest player on the women's side humpy koru is a is a legend of the game I mean she is a beast this one was a Catalan and in this position black plays this or this 99% of the time humpy goes Knight E4 this is a move played less than 1% of the time and the idea of knight4 the reason it's so rare is cuz you're wasting a move with a piece that you've already moved but the other idea humpy doesn't Castle she goes F5 humpy plants the night in the center of the board and she's trying to crush the young opponent it's like when you see the youngest player on a soccer field or a football field or a basketball like court right you want to go at them humpy plays this game like she has zero respect for her o I'm not I'm not saying she she definitely has a lot of I'm saying from the compe humpy's next move is H5 I mean you talk about a gangster approach to the game of chess and you know what's crazy if white goes H4 humpy was going to go G5 yeah oh yeah yeah this looks really unpleasant and then after this I mean yeah Black's just going H4 like that's the next move and what's crazy is you you know you the best move is actually to take with the bishop so you get your queen in the game and white could just get mated so nulle has to be really careful she brings the Knight away from the King humpy plays H4 and white is like in a box I mean this is really nasty to deal with Knight C3 takes takes humpy's entire opening has proved successful she brings the queen up and now she just got to go G5 rotate the queen over and maybe Castle right but she plays Queen F7 and nulle is not not going to get bullied she starts fighting back humpy takes noru takes with the queen humpy plays Bishop D7 but here's the thing if black castles right I think black might be in some serious trouble if you Castle here with black Bishop D6 you cannot take because it's a fork and not only is it a fork when I take your queen it's another Fork which is gross but losing a queen's bad enough so people play now humpy can't castle at all she's not going to Castle she going to bring the queen forward she's still attacking it's very complicated and both players have no time 10 minutes seven minutes nul starts fighting back in the center humpy fires another Pawn at the white king but whose King is weaker well I got news for you nul's King goes for a walk and here's the thing if this attack doesn't work Black's got nothing Black's King is never going to find shelter humpy goes G4 but she's opening up the position for Nuru and the king is back on its home square but completely safe King G7 Nuru takes the pawn back and brings the bishop and black makes her 25th move we trade the pieces but all of a sudden nurul's just winning she's going to pick up material and humpy never gets the attack that she dreamed of nurul now slowly methodically makes progress in the position still very complicated very low time by the players nervy decisions to be made but when it's all said and done white is up two pawns and nul to her credit youngest player I mean humpy I think is maybe 35 and Nuru is 19 and she just slowly brings the pieces forward and converts takes a little while but two pawns up in an end game like this we get all the way down to Rook F7 humpy what a great game and again I'm I'm not saying humpy like disrespect no that's what I'm saying but I'm saying humpy is 100 plus points higher rated she has played in multiple candidates and it's clear from the opening she was ready to just bulldoze credit to Nuru for showing up and what a great fight and she wins a very deserved game beating a 2550 rated grandmas that's a great result for her she now was up to two points now oh my Anna muzichuk versus leting Yeah Anna muzichuk has been in a in a crazy roller coaster of a tournament yesterday she a plus five position today against leing we have an exchange frenge defense which is just really annoying I mean Ling shows up plays the French it gets neutralized this game I'm fast forwarding because we we traded a lot of pieces by move 20 this is the position after move 20 it's Queen and rook and five Queen Rooks and five and queen Rooks uh and four and white has the two pawns and Anna does an excellent job of defending her King from the attack while being up two pawns and she just plays this game Like a Surgeon excellent technique trades the Queens gets the pawns mobilized and it's just a matter of time she's just winning I mean she she's not completely winning but she's much better in the end game and it's going to be slow and steady she gets the Breakthrough she takes and when it's all said and done the pressure pays off she's got the pass pawn and she's looking to win she has a two versus two end game but she has has two closer pawns one of them is two squares away from queening and all the hard work pays off because at the very end she finds Rook D5 and here leier instead of putting the Rook she she had like some somewhere around here L lay had a chance I think instead of King G6 she might have needed to go King G7 but the whole thing is like losing and stockfish doesn't even realize how bad it is as you can see um like the whole thing was was winning for white and pressure and pressure and pressure and in this position it's over the only chance black has is getting the king to join the pawns now King and pawn versus King and Rook is a draw provided certain criteria is met okay the King has to get back in time but here white has a choice do you play Rook D5 or Rook G8 Anna chooses the wrong way the winning technique for white is to put the Rook behind the pawn you may ask yourself what king F4 like I don't how is this how am I stopping the pawn you stop it like this King F7 King F4 but not taking the pawn you need to cross the path of the Rook to H5 and then you stop the pawn at the last moment possible and now you win and and amuk in this position had to find that idea to cross the path of the rook and go from the other side and by the way if everything was one rank forward like if this is the position as you can see it's a draw she missed it she did this and what happens now is you run all the way down and in this position white promotes black promotes to a night and this is a draw unbelievable unbelievable and Anam musuk snatching a draw from the jaws of Victory as they say brutal I mean she's had two winning positions back Tob back and she drew them both uh and they played on and some of you may be wondering why this is not a win there is no way to actually get the Knight I mean unless you walk over there then you're going to lose uh but uh as long as you keep your uh now you know so King and Knight versus King and Rook is a draw provided the Knight just stays close there is no way to win the night and uh the player shuffled for a while and ultimately made it is unbelievable now n basov versus ala fuja now n basov has had a weird tournament first of all by a miracle of God three out of his first four games have been with white okay playing white is a big deal because you get to dictate the Bas of the opening he lost the game he played with black but it was close now he's drawn a couple of people he drew nepo right yesterday he had a pretty pretty seamless draw I forget against Hikaru um soot plays D4 and Ali Reza plays a NSO right plays AO Indian and I can't quite tell what n's role is in the tournament is he trying to be a dark horse is he trying to spoil people's tournaments is he trying to be be like Nuru right Nuru lowest rated player waving a flag in front of people to try to get them to attack her well he plays very solidly right Ali ressa plays a little bit provocatively plays a slight sideline but from the opening I mean nijat is just he's just playing real solid and D5 and you know he trades and the DNC pawns are gone for both players he has a position of total Symmetry and what Ali Resa does in this game is he tries Ali Resa really tries and you see there's a crazy tactical sequence Bishop takes you know white can take the Knight but this so he sacrific te boom boom you can take on B5 here uh but then you would lose your Rook so don't do that we have Rook D1 Queen C7 and we have this Poss this is what we got to work with Ali res is doing his best he's up 15 minutes on the clock he got the bishop for the night and uh a few moves later we have we have a little bit of imbalance here little bit of imbalance right three pawns versus four but this is not enough and the worst part is even if this Pawn was not doubled like even if it was a fouron three even a four on three is not enough you may be wondering why a queen is hanging here because that Queen was hanging a moment ago Ali resar really tries his best he puts the pressure but you you just cannot win this position and it is so hard to play chess like you could be up straight up up a pawn and it's just not good enough it's just not good enough and um yeah alza tried for hours and uh just instructive just for anybody you know this is a losing end game four on three pawns is losing four on three with a bishop a knight or a rook uh or a queen is not losing and uh yeah NAD is not stupid so he does not trade the Queens he keeps them on he keeps threatening with checks and after a long and brutal fight uh we end in a draw so n one and a half out of four alyza one and a half out of four both guys have lost the game alyza toppo and N to uh Fabiano and I mean so far n has made three draws but he's got three out of four with white so when he's playing Black in the next two rounds he's going to get hunted and it could the tournament could spin out of control really quickly he's got a really buckle down now uh Katarina LNO versus tanong tanong currently winning the women's candidates uh but um but uh yeah she showed up today looking for a fight she played a nidor sicilian and LNO Play Bishop B2 which is one of the lines Knight B3 and the players in this game played a very positional night or so in the night ORF black likes B5 and the D5 square is very important white decides how they want to play how they want to control the light squares on the queen side do you want to play F4 do you play the bishop out here and trade and a lot of you know a lot of question mark So Rook C1 an interesting approach Bishop F3 securing this you know control of the center Knight D2 you know coming back and at some point white there we go so white pushes the end there we go and white is preparing slowly the Knight takes the bishop so black has lost control of the D5 Square all right Bishop C4 is a is a big decision trading the Knight away and but again that piece loses control of D5 which is the million dollar Square lagno bites her time and black aggressively giving up the you know the pawn and and opening things up and um White's got the two Bishops so just logically this is a really really big risk that that tanong is taking she's very confident but Katarina lagno is kind of like like a like a boxer you know she's rolling with the punches she's looking for her momentum to strike and at some point she will right now she's kind of gliding every like look at Katarina's moves every move is one square right that except that one like every move okay that was two squares one square sliding back sliding to the side sliding sliding up a square SL you sliding like this sliding like that getting the queen and all of a sudden you know Rook C3 tungi very forceful but white is winning white goes back to C6 and finally it's time to strike and she's she's cleaning up this is just like the uh the musuk game a lot of pass pawns D6 A5 and white is totally winning Bishop G3 that's it these two pawns are unstoppable like you just can't White's going to walk into the position H5 Queen F3 Queen G6 Rook A8 it's a completely winning position petagno right here can put the dagger in the heart do you go forward do you come back well here's the thing you're going to lose this Pawn but this one will win you the game it's the furthermost pawn on the board so you have to come to F2 why because after check you hide in the corner your Bishop protects your king and you escort The Pawn King G7 you can't rush because then Bishop C5 you have to be careful but what you do is you play Queen C8 Bishop D6 and you play A6 and white is completely winning completely winning Bishop E5 you have to be careful but you are winning Katarina lagno moves the bishop to the wrong Square loses her pawn and it's even worse than that she's going to lose the the the the the trade here and uh it's just a Perpetual check so games are getting decided on the final moment this game the light te game they're like there are there's just you go like this is chess okay this is chess and it is absolutely brutal Fabian Carana versus GES both these so tanong retains her first place status by the way so she was very close to losing today but she has three points out of four she has two wins two draws and tomorrow is a res day um Fabiano Carana versus gukesh this one an Italian so this the first Italian of the candidates by the way uh we've had a couple of spanish's we had we had like that ridiculous five that prog played this is a first Italian and this is a closed Italian a Mainline Italian with they I've been studying a little bit of Italian recently cuz I got a little tired I was like these top players they play this all the time I want to break it down for all of you in general for black the Italian is separated into Dynamic A5 and a little bit more solid A6 black goes here anticipating White's expansion on the queen side and all of this has happened in in a lot of games in fact gkes has had this position twice okay he had this position against um uh at the Olympiad I think it was against Yip Peno and in that game he played Queen E7 which is not the most popular move but you can do a lot of things in this position and then Bishop 2 E6 now after takes takes the main line of this position is Queen C2 and black will either play Queen D7 or D5 like that is generally what black does you know Knight E7 also in preparing this the move I have never seen before is Rook E8 so you bring the rookie out and then you bring it back that's weird and as you can tell from the time spend either gcash is bluffing like a like a madman or he knows something we don't that's the only explanation like I I you know I I I don't really know uh oh sorry I don't really know what else to say and Fabiano begins to make him pay he rotates right gukesh plays D5 and then he plays B5 so I mean gukesh really aggressively coming at Fabi and Fabiano plays Knight F5 and you know there's an argument to be made here the computer gives a top engine move Rook A3 if you can explain Rook A3 to me I'll give you some money I mean I I I stared at this move for like five minutes I have no idea what the idea of this move is um Queen E2 is possible as well uh with the intention to put the bishop here and support these pawns like against this there a lot of meta strategy in the Italian that I'm not going to bore you with but what I will not bore you with is the fact that the position completely explodes and you know it looks like can sacrifice there's no attack I promise there's no attack and it's the candidates you cannot take such a degree of risk Knight E5 Knight F5 and gkes comes here and just says you know what I'm down a pawn but fa has doubled F pawns cold blooded by the way I mean seriously cold blooded puts the Knight on uh sorry plays C5 first he could have went Knight D5 and this is Fab's biggest chance this is the moment in the game Fabiano has his biggest chance um maybe he can take on A4 maybe he can take on C5 the engine really liked his position here I thought black had a lot of weaknesses but at the end of the day Fab's extra Pawn is this the Knight goes to C6 he trades the Rooks he simplifies the position great move by the way by by go I just Fant the Knight is stuck and you can't keep it protected because black sneaks in with two pass pawns and suddenly black is winning so CB4 a fantastic move CB4 excellent move a move that I think caught Fabiano a little bit off guard like I think Fabiano maybe you know calculated this and was like see really can he do this yeah cuz he spent like 5 and A2 minutes uh or almost six minutes and yeah now we have this end game and Fabby is up a double def pawn and he is not able to capitalize on it gukesh plays fantastically well gets it into a queen end game and uh you know this this this looks like it wins but it doesn't because white is not in time to protect the pawn G4 G6 the pawn stays black takes it and black survives so Queen E1 Queen D5 credit to my man GES D I mean this man played a slightly subpar Italian today against an Italian if I may and uh a million checks later they make a draw 74 moves GES did not have a great Italian I mean I'm I'm I'm gonna I'm gonna make a a bold prediction 10 minutes on this move means that that was not prep and I think that GES got away with one because if you check the the Italian databases this is not the way it's played and so I think Fabiano missed the chance today putting some serious pressure and you got to give credit to gukesh uh he remains in a tie for first uh with with you know with the guys that have two points so well done by him now gachina versus Vali yesterday Vali scored a massive win today she shows up against one of the strongest players in the field Alexandra gach whose name cuts off the screen uh and this one a very very forcing one and I'm actually just going to kind of scroll and click through it uh very tense but the tension was relieved uh by trading and then by trading and then by trading and then by trading a little bit more and nobody was able to break through here as all the pieces fell off the board it happens it happens now where it did and it was a draw a little while later now where it didn't happen is in the game Yan pishi versus VI Guy and um one of these guys won another game now vidit won a game and lost the game in this tournament uh Yan won against Le Resa and has made two draws and E4 E5 night after3 night C6 Bishop B5 we saw vidd play the Berlin against Hikaru Knight F6 but what's fascinating about the database of vidit and I looked this up not a lot of people take vidit into the Berlin endgame Knight F6 became popular in the world championship match between Vladimir karnick and Gary Kasparov in the year 2000 because of the direct attack on this pawn and the invitation to go to this series of moves so this series of moves became popular in the year 2000 where black trades the queens and loses the right to Castle damages their C pawns gives white more Pawns in the center but but has the two Bishops white only has one and now we play from here thousands of games have occurred in this position with dozens of different approaches by white do you play C4 C3 B3 Knight C3 H3 does The Rook go there there does the bishop come there does the Knight go there does the Knight go there does the bishop go there a lot of different plans but here's the thing vidid has not played a lot of these end games in classical chess he hasn't most people don't allow the Berlin anymore so nepo takes a very principled approach he goes old school he says you know what let's test the Berlin endgame skills of vidd GTI Knight C3 now against Knight C3 black has many approaches okay and vidit does have a game of Bishop E7 with the intention to play Knight H4 so you put your king back on E8 Bishop F4 black will frequently put the Knight here and trade if white tries to mess around in this game vid plays Bishop D7 so it seems like the idea is Bishop here this is kind of vidit this is the prep like vidit was ready for this and he was going to play Bishop D7 so H3 this has been played before white can play a lot of different things vidit plays H6 very principled looks for G5 stops anything from going to G5 and now in this position a lot of things have happened B3 to put the bishop out that way Bishop F4 Rook D1 nepo shows up with a move that has literally I think it's never happened it might have happened in one game he goes here the reason why that's not considered a very good move is because if black CH goes to E7 the squares are weakened so now if you play like Bishop F4 black has H5 and black now has a Target so G4 is considered slightly inaccurate because of this kind of Counter Strike right but Yan plays Knight H2 and this approach has never been seen so nepo shows up and creates a new idea in something that has been played now for nearly 25 years vidit can go Knight G6 but he doesn't like the pawns but apparently H5 is quite strong but again the idea is to have this stronghold and that doesn't look very pleasant to deal with okay so vidit thinks for a long time and he plays G5 he thinks for 36 minutes let me tell you right now you're opping things for 36 minutes he doesn't know the opening anymore so Yan has won the Battle of the opening and he plays F4 he's not done winning the battle of the opening vid takes on F4 Bishop F4 vid plays Bishop E6 spends another 10 minutes Bishop E6 maybe the Knight is going here maybe the king is coming and maybe The Rook is coming right now this is a check but it doesn't do anything the king just goes away um so Knight E4 Yan's still in prep Knight E4 Yan still in his prep B6 from vidit common idea walk the king to B7 Knight F3 finally Jan is out of prep and the idea here is going to be to put pressure on the side where you're stronger put pressure on the endgame side that you've opened up vid plays C5 creates that barrier Right light squares looking very nice he has to put a lot of pressure on the light squares cuz he has light squared Bishop nepo puts the Knight on F6 that's a 15-minute thought from Yan plants the knight in vid's position and it's going to be a question of in the long run can vidit survive with these weaknesses the King goes for a walk to C8 King goes for a walk to B7 whites King Meanwhile by the way can I can I just say in the middle of this game Yan plays King G2 King G3 this is some highlevel stuff the Berlin endgame is a fascinating highle Battleground it's the best comparison I can give like to to to a sport that has a lot more finesse than people give it respect for like fencing you know maybe golf not a lot of people know you know probably like the mechanics and everything like this is such highlevel play to bring the king forward and not touch anybody else just improving the position now vidit another high level move A5 13 minutes spent basically says I want to restrict Jan's Queen side Yan here could have played A4 he plays A3 engine didn't love it the engine wanted him to to stop vidit right there but Jan I think was like look this bishop can't touch these pawns if they're on dark squares so vid it takes as much space as possible a lot of meta strategy involved here but Yan putting pressure on the clock as well can we just take a moment and appreciate Jan's got a 55 Z time Advantage but he does have a history of over playing the position playing too quickly giving up his Advantage so which Yan is GNA show up right Rook D1 Knight C6 by vidit vidit has 38 minutes to make 19 moves or he loses on time that is two minutes per move that is not a lot of time C3 from Yan Bishop E7 and right here Yan gave away his Advantage because of the well time strike H5 and suddenly the side of the board that Janis crowded with his pieces with all the weaknesses seems to be collapsing Yan plays G5 pretty quickly maintaining a very large time advantage and continuing to put vidit under pressure now when I say he gives away his advantage that's a bit of an overstatement but as you can see the computer is getting more confident that black you know Black's position is quite good black should probably start just coming straight down the middle here just come straight down the middle the point is if you lose the battle for the defile black is just going to be happy but you you got to be careful right so probably I would play bishop d8 and continue to fight on this side it's very complicated game vidd plays Rook A5 and he's trying to justify this Pawn position it's really clever stuff to put pressure on the pawn on B2 now Yan plays Rook E1 what is the idea what look at Bishop C1 I mean this is what is he doing now vidit plants The Rook on B3 right with pressure over here not a move that is very liked by the computer Yan kind of set a bear trap here he puts a little clamp now on that rook and he like you're not going to put me under pressure I'm G to break through the position whoa FG Knight G6 Rook d8 VI it has 16 minutes for 12 moves or he's going to lose the game but is this a correct simplification from Yan okay he can win the pawn but his King is out in the open Yan goes for it Knight takes Pawn he just goes for it he says you know what vid it that was the entire point of the opening we go all the way back to the beginning this whole plan all of this was to create these weaknesses and wouldn't you know it 15 moves later none of those pawns exist and now it's basically a matter of will these pawns make it down the board Rook F3 Pawn takes VD it has 9 minutes to make nine moves he grabs the pawn back the material is equal but the Rook doesn't have a lot of help The Rook doesn't have a lot of help E6 a critical moment Now The Rook has help he's going to break the Rook out with the move before shattering Neo's position nepo plays Bishop G5 getting rid of the Knight very big moment vid plays Knight to D5 the pawn is sneaking in but vidid has it under lock and key you can't queen because then I take and all your pawns follow apart so it's not winning yet Bishop D7 Rook D1 very very big moment do you protect with the King do you protect with the bishop protects like this King E4 and in this position vidit needed to sense the danger and he needed to play Knight takes E7 the pawn can no longer Sur he has to give up the Knight take the pawn and go for the draw down a knight but with a lot of extra pawns white would play Knight F4 black would play something like Rook 2 Rook A2 and you are losing by material maybe it's just losing but that is probably what you have to do instead vid it goes here he trades the knights and yanomi puts the rook in prison The Rook is now officially stuck because the bishop is under attack you can win my Rook but you allow the queen this Rook is the downfall of the entire black position the way Yan lured him in I mean this is Sensational Bishop G6 check is played in the game The Rook goes to d8 the game is over vid it tries The Rook is free but the bishop will die Bishop D7 and now he doesn't even Queen do you know what he does have that is do you know what the idea is to take the bishop and make a queen Rook C3 Rook D7 Rook F3 King E6 and that's it and you're making a queen because the bishop this bishop is a monster Yan pishi Rook d8 traps this rook in here wins the game and is winning the candidates tournament with three points out of four your standings after four rounds of action and speaking of yan pishi tomorrow I will be uploading an interview with him a 30 minute interview we talk about his career we talk about the previous candidate so watch that video tomorrow let me know in the comments if you're hyped uh I did a poll on my channel so you did want to 50% of you wanted to see that first he is winning the candidates with three points out of four here's a fun fact in the TW 32 round Yan pom has played 32 rounds of candidates 14 14 now four he has been leading the candidates or tied for first in all 32 rounds so iano Carana has got some catching up to do gesh 2 and a half out of four tomorrow is a rest day there are no games tomorrow all the players will breathe we need to see Hikaru win a game right Hikaru we thought was a pre-tournament favorite along with Fabiano and nepo maybe not all of you thought that but that seemed to be the consensus hikaro has had a little bit of a slow start looking to see if he's going to bounce back obviously vidit two losses in a row vidit will either now have a solid event or a disastrous event he's had three decisive games in a row he's got to stabilize he's got to use the resda he's got to bounce back kukesh in great shape I mean the candidates are looking crazy and tomorrow I will upload my interview with Yan POI that we did right before the tournament started if you watch this in the first three hours go check out a coron 33% off I will see you all tomorrow with the nepo interview the day after round number five of the candidates get out of here
