a few years ago I saw this animated gift on social 
media and I was mesmerized also confused because   I'm thinking how on Earth would you design 
something like that so all those different   unusual shaped objects all like perfectly missing 
each other like just contacting and moving through   like that is absolutely incredible this was 
posted by someone named Daniel perer they go   by at Kangaroo physics online Daniel did reveal 
how this is done it turns out it's just a moving   cross-section through a 3D packing of rods 
in this case they are hexagonal prism rods   and square prism rods and you just take a 
cross-section as you go through and because   all the rods are like flush up against each other 
when you move through their cross-section because   they're on angles it looks like it's moving 
around and just perfectly missing everything   else and I got in touch with Daniel and he 
actually sent me a uh 3D uh model of this   so uh which you can see what I've got there and 
you can play around with this and move it about   and so you look at that so it's these are the 
square ones going that way and that way and that   way and you got the hexagonal ones going the other 
way I now had a new problem because this reminded   me of the hexa sticks that I made many many years 
ago if you've been watching the channel for a long   time you'll remember this video where I was uh 
bored in a hotel room um my uh physicist wife   was at a conference and I thought I would build a 
ridiculous maass thing and I built a hexa STI and   as as you can see I so proud of how well it turned 
out how all my hair fell out absolutely incredible   and for two years now I've been thinking ah 
wouldn't it be great if I could build this model   because this has got seven different types of 
rods going through it out of pencils in the same   way the hexa sticks was built but to do that well 
first of all I would need it'd be handy if they   different colors I would need more hexagonal 
pencils ideally in four different colors and   so sure enough got some of them uh so for example 
in this packet here these ones they're the black   ones I've also got a yellow and some other colors 
as well but then I would need Square cross-section   pencils to complement these to get these I had 
to contact a pencil manufacturer and specify   that I need to have hexagonal four different 
colors Square three colors such that they the   same width when you line them up and that means 
I can build them into this shape I think I've   never done this before I mean no one has ever 
done this before so we're going to have to work   out the instructions as we go in theory when 
we finish it's going to look like that check   that out that was that's uh that's future mat 
there having successfully built it it's pretty   amazing I'm so so tempted reach out if you reach 
out that will anger camera person Alex a lot yeah   good point and um there will be both past present 
and future camera person Alex will will be very upset this video is sponsored by Jane Street 
and their many Fantastic courses detail in the   description and the end of the video one 
of the advantages of getting the pencils   custom made is I could allocate colors so the 
square one on are RGB red green blue and I've   gone for cyan magenta and yellow plus uh black 
or k before we go into the the whole shape I'm   going to build a small model just out of these 
and a small model out of these separately and   then we're going to Define some terms if 
you're actually trying to build this thing   and you want to see what I'm doing in more 
detail we will put a much longer cut with all   of the details over on the second Channel and 
now for the slightly more complicated hexagon version okay and now I've done the four 
tetrahedral directions that's what I'm   calling them which is why I've labeled the pencils 
tetrahedral AB c and d and there you are I've now   got a hexagon going in every single Direction 
made up of seven pencils so the center pencils   I guess are the center four four axes and then 
I've just done one layer out in each Direction   same as I did here with the three I'm calling 
them Cube directions where I've got a center one   in each Direction and then I've done one layer 
out around it and if you want to make the hexa   sticks model that I did previously you just keep 
doing this so you just add another layer of each   one and for a hexa stick you actually take out the 
ones behind as you increase each of these so they   become like Hollow cylinders in each Direction 
and I could make that again but what I want to   do is somehow combine these pleasingly these are 
two of the possible six very regular packings of   cylinders in 3D space uh there was a seminal 
paper uh you can see it here I've got on the   laptop called the invariant cubic Rod cylinder 
packings symmetries and coordinates and down   here on the second page you can see all six of 
them so the top two are Cube based and that's   one of the ones I've built here that's the one 
on the right we've basically built that packing   and then you got the tetrahedral ones so this one 
here we've built that is the oh I'm pretty sure   it's the one on the left yes let's go with that 
one on the left and the ones we're not building   any of are the ones where I would need triangle 
cross-section pencils although I have now got a   contact at a pencil manufacturer and actually 
Daniel did send me a visualization of another   arrangement of triangle prism rods and if you 
look at the moving cross-section you can see   you get another one of these cool um patterns 
but we're not doing that what we're doing today   is we're going to try and combine both of these 
into this into this 3D model which is not in that   paper because this is a semi-regular packing 
of rods in 3D space but it's it's the two of   these combined we need to get this one have I 
made the same handedness yeah like that so we   need to get this one which uh if I match it up 
the blue facing camera we'll do it with that   camera there blue facing red and then green so 
you can see that if you just look at the square   ones is that except these are all like flush 
faces and these are like orthogonal where they   line up with the direction they're going with 
here you can see they all need to be twisted   at 45° that will hopefully happen once we combine 
it with this set which as you can see that's the   other hexagonal ones and Daniel very kindly 
altered this 3D model so the colors here match   the actual colors that I've got the pencils made 
in thank you so much to Daniel P for doing that   for me so what we're going to do now I think hm 
let's should we start a new one let's you know   what I'm going to keep both of these just so if 
what I'm about to do doesn't work we at least we   get something and I'm going to start a whole new 
model to try and build try and build this here we   go on to the main event I'm going to keep both of 
these cuz I like them and I'm not short of pencils   so to be able to get custom pencils you've got to 
order a lot so I don't even know how many are in   these giant boxes of pencils but there there's a 
lot in those and I've got several of these of each   type and actually I'll make all the leftover ones 
available uh if you go to Mas gear you'll be able   to buy uh we'll package them up so you can have a 
full set enough to build whatever it is I end up   building today so that's my promise to you okay 
I think to do this I'm going to start should I   build all of this you know what I'm just going to 
do these four Reds here going through these four   greens going for through the four so I'm going to 
do the corner four of each of those that should   give me enough play I will then guess putting in 
the tetrahedral ones so here we go and then the   blue go through the middle and on top in this 
direction so one of these is going to go right   through the center through there okay so that's 
that Center one one and then I want one there you   know what just to make my orientation life easier 
I'm going to fill in the rest of these the trick   now is to rotate those together there we go okay 
I'm being careful to copy this because uh Daniel   made this for me and they very kindly spent a 
while working out what's like a subset of the rods   cuz in theory this is like a lattice that would 
go in every single Direction infinitely far but   Daniel worked out like what subset of rods would 
give you like a stable Arrangement that should   be able to be held in place by elastic bands So 
in theory I could add more or fewer of any of   these seven different pencils but in the first 
pass I'm going to just try and follow exactly   the subset here that Daniel recommended but to be 
fair I mean they very kind spent their time on it   but even they were like I there's like so many 
different ways you could pick a subset of this   um packing who knows this may not be the optimal 
one so I'm going to build what I can see there   and then afterwards we'll have a play to determine 
if we do think that was the best possible one the   other thing I've done differently this time so if 
you compare this I think that's pretty much it to   the one I did before there's one fewer pencil 
in each Direction oops two fewer greens now   the other thing I've done is I have tried to line 
up the labels on the pencils so I didn't bother   doing that for these which might bug some people 
but now you can see all the blue ones all have   orthogonal Zed AIS at the same end facing the same 
way so now everyone's happy okay having done that   I now need to guess not guess very carefully 
calculate where some of these yellow ones go   so this yellow you know I'm going to do this 
yellow one here and I'm pretty much just going   to do exactly what I can see there so if you put 
it this way it goes through this Gap here it goes   under a single red and then on the other side it 
goes under the the topmost blue so it goes through   where' it go there's three greens those three 
greens that one red and that one blue okay so in theory now it's not happy cuz again all of these 
Square end pencils all need to end up 45° from   where they like to be if it was just them but 
cuz we have these coming in with their hexagonus   they're all going to twist slightly so maybe 
I could try and put all the yellows in at once   should we do that I feel like there's going to be 
some symmetries oh yeah this other yellow one is   doing the same thing I just did but different 
colors so this one oh okay needs to go that   way this one Cuts those three red there like that 
that's it there and then it goes under one green   under one blue so it's what I just did but from a 
different direction so under oops under one green   which is that green under one blue which is that 
blue oh in a perfect world The Cube grid will be   enough to be able to put in all of one color at 
a time and then I can just be nice and systematic   about it I was a bit nervous I'd have to rotate 
through you know gradually building up more of   each color as I went but we'll see and so this one 
cuts off two Blues huh interesting no I guess that   doesn't feel right oh okay it's just cuz I was 
trying to line it up on the outside it does it   takes off those two blues that goes through three 
greens and a number of Reds wait what if I kind of   squash this down will that give me a better angle 
oh okay here we go those three Greens in there   that's that blue come on the Reds I don't know one 
thing I've learned already is don't start with the   full nine where you've got three in each Direction 
because it's really hard to orientate oops because   these all have one corner missing when you look 
at it you can pretty quickly see oh there's like   there's no blue one there which means when I look 
at the model I can know it goes up this way cuz   that missing one's in the bottom right hand corner 
so definitely don't start with that start with a   slight asymmetry it makes your life a lot easier 
to line things up let's do the first one there and   I'm going to hold it with that finger then I'm 
going to get through that same Gap here yep and   then it's got to kind of push it down to work that 
whoops there we go don't you go anywhere okay so   so now I've got one set of the four going through 
and I'm hoping the other ones are going to be the   same thing but going to get easier each time and 
because of the symmetries it should be pretty   straightforward sometimes if you kind of squash 
it down it opens up some of the holes through   there oh yikes up next we'll put in Black which 
Daniel has very kindly labeled in Gray to make it   a little bit easier to see so where was I I was 
there and now I'm going to swing it around this   way so I'll be looking down the barrel of blue 
red green yes okay the further into this build I   go because there's more other rods in place the 
more obvious it gets for where the missing ones   go so now this one takes off the same three Reds 
no greens and a single blue okay so it's basically   this on the other side so same three Reds as this 
one there single blue there oh look at that that   wasn't even difficult oh the I can see the square 
pencils are naturally twisting themselves onto a   different axis I just got to be careful they're 
all going the same way so my labels stay aligned   H you know what I had a lot of success last time 
doing the short to so this is the short diagonal   if you mention this is a rhombus short diagonal 
long diagonal I found last time doing the two   ones on the short diagonal first made life easy 
so let's try that there's your other green and   then you're out the other side aha that's it all 
right there it is that's that's the model so what   I've done there is in theory exactly the same as 
what we've done uh over here and as far as we're   aware in terms of what Daniel very kindly did 
for me that's like the the nicest neatest like   subset of the infinite lattice of these stacked 
rods which produce that fantastic uh the original   That animated gift is through just a bigger 
version of this Ah that's so pleasing oh but   you know what a little bit of me thanks like these 
I quite like the square ones I kind of want to put   in the ninth one for each of those so we get the 
full Square effect cuz then the elastic bands will   form squares and at the moment these ones here 
the hexagonal ones the elastic bands form it's a   rhombus it's lovely what if they were hexans okay 
so that's all the cube orientation ones done the   X Y and Zed Now ABC and D for each one I've just 
got to decide how I want to complete the hexagon I   feel like uh with each rhombus this is black one 
first I've got so you can see this camera here   I've got the rhombus we already did and I can now 
decide which one's the center one which I'm going   to well it's either this one or this one I'm going 
to call this one which means I need one above and   two either side I think the easiest way to do it 
is maybe to put the sides in first then the one   no I'm going to do the one above first and then 
I'll fill in the missing sides so let's see how   that goes thankfully there's a lot of like it's 
not perfectly regular but there is still a lot of   symmetry in this so if in doubt the point where it 
looks the most symmetric is probably correct I'm   not 100% sure I got the blacks right to start with 
I'll put you know what I'm going to put in magenta   and cyan and then I'll come back and revisit 
my my thoughts on uh on black righto cyan time surely I feel like this just goes through 
here and that's going to be fine I feel   like if I put that extra magenta oh let's 
just do it now put this Magenta in I reckon   that will hold that blue one I just put in in 
place a bit better so sorry Canan let's put   that through there and through there and then 
that's oh I'm still not con I think that one's   it's definitely wrong it's definitely wrong 
what have I done wrong think with you okay   here's what I'm up against that I mean that 
is I think that's quite lovely I'm you know   happy with this I feel like that's a wonderful 
model this is the actual combination of these   two exactly as they were built into one model 
what would hold that in place oh the next red downward but then if I put the next red down in 
it's just going to keep getting bigger Ah that's flat that's flat   there's seven different surfaces it should be 
stable on I'm just trying to make sure for each of   them the pencils in that axis are aligned and the 
rest of the mass is roughly in the middle of that   axis I think the squares would fit I can see all 
the holes they would go in the only question would   be if I put in one like here would that be stable 
yeah that's like fixed it's got a little bit of cuz that would sit on two of those there you know   what let me let me try it for one let me 
try it for one and see how we feel about it you know what that is very pleasing 
actually now that I'm doing it all right I'm doing them all okay here we go they're just perfectly slotting into 
pre-existing gaps in the rest of the lce yes 100% that's it now it feels complete and 
all the hexagons are the perfect shape and all the   squares are square enough um I say Square enough 
because the squares instead of um and this makes   sense now I think about it CU before I had the 
squares were these 3x3 and that's because the   outside flat edges of the square lined up with the 
overall shape of the square and then the model we   had worked out because they all Twist by 45 we now 
still had that would be the Red Square there and   we had the missing one up here but now they're 45 
to that in reality what's ended up happening the   nicest way of doing it is once again we filled 
in the other corners of the square so now the   square cross-sections are once again square with 
the square those squares are square square which   apparently is hip 67 pencils only five shy of 
the hexas sticks part of me wonders if you could   start removing some of the center ones now but 
I think no I'm going to declare it that's the   official sculpture 67 pencils I'm going to call it 
obviously there are other subsets of the stacking   of rods that you could have built instead but 
if you want to build the specific model that   I have now semi invented discovered the 67 pencil 
sculpture that is it that is the 67 pencil oh and   it's nice cuz elastic bands all form hexagons 
and squares and it is it's the combination   of your three right angle a axes with your four 
tetrahedral angle axes and you get this and if you   cut a moving crosssection through this you get the 
animated gif that we started with at the beginning   Ah that's so nice and speaking of nice that 
reminds me of this video sponsor Jane Street I've   been wearing a Jane Street t-shirt the whole time 
by the way so there you look at me branded uh Jam   I mean if you've enjoyed this video and you like 
doing Crea interesting things with mathematics   I cannot over recommend checking out some of Jane 
Street's fantastic educational programs they offer   for University and pre-university students they're 
currently accepting applications for courses   running in their New York and London officers 
and they're all different lengths and they cover   different subject matters but generally speaking 
they cover stem topics you may be interested   in such as programming mathematics of course 
statistics and much more for example the uh one   course is running this is open to uh women and 
in fact any gender expansive people who may be   underrepresented traditionally in stem and J 
Street do have like jobs you can apply for but   that's a whole separate thing these courses 
are not recruitment it's something they do   to support the education community and if you 
do want to get involved or you know someone   that you can recommend these two you don't 
need to already have a background in finance   to apply changer are just looking for Curious 
people from any background who have a passion   F technology and enjoy creative prod problem 
solving applications for the courses will be   closing in the next couple of weeks do check out 
Jane Street I'll link to wise and everything else   in the description below now I do genuinely have 
hundreds I think only hundreds oh dear goodness   hopefully not thousands of the pencils you need 
to make this sculpture we will package them up so   you've got enough to build this and obviously if 
you got enough to build this you could build the   separately if you want to build these and this 
you might have to buy more than one set I don't   know if I'll let you do that I'll work that out 
later there'll be a link to mask gear below if   you want to go there and they're still available 
you can grab yourself a setad of these pencils I   don't know what we're going to charge whatever 
I need to get my money back on getting custom   pencils manufactured and while you're over at 
Mas gear it would uh be a shame for me to not   mention uh love triangle love triangle my book 
you can pre-order it uh triangles fun fact the   only shape of pencils that I couldn't get made 
you can get rounded triangle pencils we could do   the extra one I don't know maybe one day um but 
for now there you are that's it that is the 67   pencils sculpture now if you excuse me I have 
to go be future mat now that this is finished
