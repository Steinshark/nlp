so we all know that AI tools like chat gbt and other large language motors have totally changed the game for developers the thing is most of this AI generated code if you're just using the base models of these llms are going to be very generic because these AI tools don't have any context of the code that we have already written in our projects what if I told you that now there are much smarter developer tools and that can give you much more accurate code this one tool that I'm about to show to you in this video makes using AI to code so much more powerful than before because allows you to get your own personalized coding assistant that understands all the code that you have already written and all the context of your workflow to get highly contextualized code generation to make your life as a developer so much easier this tool is called pieces for developers and they are the sponsor of today's video and today I'm going to show you how you can install it for free how to easily integrate pieces into your coding workflow and finally how to use it to make you ridiculously more productive as a developer the first thing we need to do is install a which you do by going to pieces. app once we're in here we're going to click on docks right from this top menu and then we're going to click on installation and getting started now before we actually install the application there's something we need to understand when you install pieces you actually install two things at the same time first we install pieces for developers which is the actual desktop application that you'll be looking at when you use pieces but then at the same time you're installing something called pieces OS which is a background service that allows the entirety of pieces to run locally offline on your computer using something called retrieval augmented generation and we'll get back to why this is super awesome in a second but now what you need to do is click on the relevant button depending on your OS I'm going to install it for Mac OS and I'm going to click on Mac OS for Apple silicon then my computer is going to start downloading this installer package once it downloaded I'm going to click on the installer and go through the installation process and once it's done we can delete the installer and our pces application is going to open up but before we get into the application we need to make sure that the pieces OS is already running in the background What You Do by looking at the top of your screen and seeing if this little pieces icon is active and if it is that means that pieces OS is running and we can open up our application but before we get into that there's one more thing we want to install because the cool thing about beses is that it not only works as a desktop app but you can also integrated directly into your IDE so what you want to do is click on whichever IDE you use I'm using a jet brace ID called webstorm so I'm going to click on that then click on get pieces and install the webstorm and then my ID is going to open up and it's going to in install the pieces plug in directly into my ID at least on my ID I can now access pieces directly like this and we'll get back to how to use that in a second so now we have two things on our computer we have the pieces desktop app and we have the pie ID plugin so instead of pieces you can create chats just like with any llm we're going to click on new chat and then you can actually choose which llm you want to use and a big benefit of being able to use different llms is that there are actually two kinds of llms you have cloud llms that work on the cloud like chat gbt and there are also local llms that work directly on your local computer and being able to lose local llms can be really important because often these cloud-based llms can be a danger from a data and code privacy standpoint whatever data you use with chbt can be used by chbt itself to train the model and you might not want that and another disadvantage is that with a cloud-based llm like chbt you can only use it when you have an internet connection pieces is the only developer tool out there that offers both cloud and local LMS via the pieces OS that's running locally on your computer so let's say you want to use chat DBT for certain things like metas llama for some other things you can switch between them just by clicking on them right here you can even chose like the engines and things like that I'm just going to go for chat gbt 4 because that's what I use the most now you have a chat just like chat gbt what makes pieces powerful is that you can set something called context so context essentially allows you to add let's say code files so even full folders of code from your own code that then the chat will automatically understand so you can directly ask questions about your own code or add stuff to it and things like this you can get started by let's say adding a folder so I'm just going to go to my programming projects and I'm just add let's say this folder right here so now all the code in this folder right here is going to be automatically included in the context of our pieces co-pilot now what I can do is I can ask questions directly relating to my code like for example can you make some boiler plate for a component for the main component of my app and now it's going to understand what the code of my app is like and it can help me generate code for my app specifically now here's another cool thing let's say I've asked pieces to give me this navbar component now first of all it's going to give me some suggested questions if I'm want to ask any questions about the code then what I can do is click on this annotate code button right here it's going to give me back that code except with comments with pieces you never again have to manually write comments to your code which is really tedious and timec consuming you can just let this Cod pilot do it for you so pieces is going to work based on these Snippets you can save these code Snippets and then you end up basically building up this library of code Snippets which is all going to be fed into the pieces engine which can then help you in the future you can also save Snippets directly from your code so let's say this is an important component that I'm going to want to use later I can just right click it and click on save to pieces and now the snippet is going to be inside of pieces when I go back to my library right here and it's automatically naved it what's really cool is if you click on here on anchors it's actually going to include a link directly back to the original code where this nippet was added from so if you ever want to go back to it you can just click on it and it's automatically going to open it inside of your code editor and if that code is related to any GitHub repo it also automatically gives a link to that GitHub preo but what's really cool is that you can set this context not just from your own own code but for example from images so often times you might have been in these situations where you're watching let's say a tutorial online some code like on a YouTube video but you can't copy the code from the YouTube video so you'll have to manually type it out with pieces you can just take a screenshot of code and then paste that screenshot into the pieces copilot chat and it will automatically extract the code from it what you can also do is add websites and pieces can automatically extract any code defined from that website so let's say I go here Python tutorial and the python documentation I can just add this URL as context and pieces is going to do it's going to find the code that is inside of that website I can just ask it like can you get the code for the link for week references which is this code right here and now again I can save it as a snippet I can do I can annotate it I can copy I can do whatever I want most of the time when I use pieces I actually use it inside of my ID just like this so for example in my ID it just opens up as this window on the right hand side so for example let's say I have this file right here and I just want to ask something about this file I can just add it the context and now I can ask questions about specifically this file like for example if I had an issue with it I don't have to like copy the code to the chat and then ask about it I can just ask like okay I cannot drag drag page roll and it can give me some suggestions and then what's super cool when you're then in your code and you remember like okay I want to use this function here and I remember that I made it before in my other projects you can just ask pieces to find that snippet of code and then you're going to find related materials in pieces and then it's automatically going to suggest to you suggested Snippets of your previous code that could be used here and then you're going to just insert them right here and if it's correct you can just copy it boom just like that the more and more you use this the more and more powerful this engine becomes you literally have an AI engine that's literally helping you to code you can even ask about code just by highlighting it and you can just be like okay ask piece is about this it's also about helping you become a better developer to understand code better let's say you're working in a big project project like in your job and you have a massive file that you're dealing with that you don't quite understand you can just give that file as context and ask pieces co-pilot about how it works and it can literally just explain it to you last but not least let's say you're doing some research online for example recently I've been building a crypto trading barall there's a video coming about that by the way and when you go to the Chrome web store you can install the pieces Chrome extension and now let's say you find some code online that you'd want to save you're going just click on pieces and it's automatically going to find all the code that exists on this website and then you can just click on whichever ones you want to save for later and boom they're going to now appear inside of your pieces Library so that was just a quick video to introduce this tool to you again thank you for pieces for sponsoring this video I've always been of the opinion that chbt and all these llm tools that have come out are really just the beginning when it comes to using AI as programmers I think is a super cool tool go check it out down below in the description again it's completely free for you to use and the more you use it the more intell it becomes the better and more productive you will become as a developer so my link will be down below go check it out and I will see you in the next video
