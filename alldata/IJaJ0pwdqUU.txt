coming in at a back-breaking 21 pounds the Dell XPS m2010 is the god of Impractical laptops it has luggage clips we are looking at 20.1 inches of laptop meat it has nine speakers a detachable Bluetooth keyboard and even an integrated DVD player these are exceedingly rare it took our procurement team nearly two years to find one but it was worth the effort because I cannot wait to show you guys the wildest laptop that Dell ever built just a mere 17 years after they released it just like I can't wait to tell you about our spot year old bulky wallet with the ridge it will help keep your pockets light and organized click the link below and use code Linus to save 10 off your purchase and get free shipping [Music] there are plenty of contenders for the wildest laptop ever built the Asus Rog gx700 Acer Predator 21x or MSI gt80 come to mind but what all those other models have in common is that they were targeted at Gamers the Dell XPS m2010 is therefore unique in that it was actually aimed at businesses not called a portable device but rather a transportable device it was intended as more of a workstation that you could move around as opposed to a laptop which isn't to say that no one ever tried is that what I'm intended to do right now that's why this chair is here oh my gosh I'm already uncomfortable I would lose circulation in my legs in like 20 minutes it wouldn't slip off my lap though yeah it's kind of trying to turn back into oil this soft touch finish is nasty oh my god oh shoes she thick boy is this a cathode backlit LCD because this thing is enormous and heavy I don't know Finding exact specs very difficult these days this has wider ergonomic adjustments than some Modern desktop monitors oh I get it it's so you can move the display closer kind of like an AIO there's also some very forward-looking features here is this webcam oh it swivels so you can always be in frame for your important business meetings look at this delightful trackpad the fact that this exists raises so many questions like who bought this this someone bought this within Dell I mean they knew it was wild it was called the Del Camino a play on the El Camino which is neither a truck nor a car but rather something in between Holland and yet it feels like it's falling apart well come on that's not even true starting price for one of these was 3 500 US dollars but that was back in 2006 with inflation that would be about five thousand dollars in today money we ended up paying 330 and that seems to be entirely due to its Rarity not because it's particularly functional with that said it works better than I would have thought documentation and drivers are still available on dell.com but with that said I forgot how terrible Windows drivers were back in 2006 it took nearly four hours of hitting next in installers to get everything set up on this and that wasn't helped by the fact that Windows Vista is essentially no longer an operating system it's not even one of those Legacy operating systems that people are still using like Windows XP when Windows Vista went EOL everyone was like see ya now because our CPU is 64-bit capable we could have installed Windows 10 10. but I actually vetoed that because I thought it'd be more fun to see how Vista Works in 2023 and get that real good Nostalgia you're probably wondering given the substantial included keyboard I love that this is a full-size desktop keyboard with trackpad uh why it is that I'm going to get a keyboard and mouse this is the one aspect of the machine that we were simply not able to get working you can see all of my locks my scroll my number and my caps lock are flashing that's because it's in pairing mode oh it's in pairing mode yeah oh so you might say that it has a functionality impairment you think it might have something to do with this it feels like you drank a whole juice box and then threw it all up rub this around in it and then just let it dry like it's just gross touch it David actually you know what before we connect these now seems like as good a time as any to take a closer look at the base unit itself now that the keyboard is detached from it it ends up looking a lot more like an all-in-one PC than a laptop but don't kid yourself it is a laptop it has a battery it uses laptop class components and perhaps most importantly it has the mid-2000s version of laptop Hardware expansion on the right you will find what appears to be a port for the subwoofer shut up on the bottom you will find a subwoofer don't worry we're going to audition it later a removable battery it's full of round cells what's the capacity I love it uh 56 Watt hours only this has 62 in it I don't think there's a very material weight difference between this battery and this entire computer also on the bottom we'll find an air intake sticky when it was new this was worth a whopping one hour and 42 minutes of battery life which makes sense for a gaming machine but sure as heck doesn't make any sense for a business laptop and look at this it's got a built-in meter just click this button to see how much battery life you have for expansion on the side there's some weird things first we've got this little tiny 1394 firewire at the size of this thing I think they could have put a full-size one but hey what do I know I'm not an engineer next to that we've got something very interesting this is a 13-2 card reader now I'm familiar with the concept of a two-in-one card reader or even you know a six in one card reader but what is a something into card reader well the weirdest bit is that it's kind of in three so with a commonly available adapter you can get many SD and stuff in this one oh don't forget about sdio yeah an XD very important memory card standards what evens memory stick uh memory stick that was Sony's proprietary oh yeah and then the two is because you need this big fat one over here to do compact flash type one compact flash type 2 and Micro Drive Micro Drive was wild they were actual mechanical hard drives that went into a compact flash slot I forgot about those we should do a video on Micro Drive get subscribed under the compact flash slot is where things start to get really interesting if you look very closely there's a little engraved expansion card there that's because this slot is what we used to have when laptops took expansion cards this is called Express card and it's actually a PCI Express slot in there that you could use to add things like high-speed USB or networking connectivity to your laptop not that you would need to add networking to this one ah not only not only does it have gigabit Lan it even has an rj11 connector for the built-in modem dial up baby next to it we've got oh this is amazing uh s video and DVI out for high definition external displays apparently reviewers at the time got really annoyed that they included in the box and external TV tuner instead of building it in I guess that's when Dell started their dongles my laptop doesn't have internal Hardware to be permanently attached to the wall it's TV Linus you need to have TV on something like this anywho over on the other side we have two USB 2 ports and I don't oh this must be for the TV tuner adapter oh yeah do we have it we don't we don't okay well sorry guys we don't have the TV tuner that plugs into oh the power brick that plugs into this port is awesome she's heavy and she'll do oh wow a mere 150 watts you can get power bricks the size it'll do like 250 now finally on the left side we've got a Kensington lock I mean you hate for this thing to grow legs and wander away two more USB 2 ports and a microphone and headphone jack along with this button let's plug in some peripherals now but oh I guess there's a few things that we missed I alluded to this before but not only does the keyboard have integrated media controls there is a secondary set of media controls touch sensitive all along the top of the device that belies its secondary function after all life can't be all about business surely sometimes you want to play and this I'm going to put a DVD in it uh Alex you brought a Blu-ray that seems optimistic shut up no way yeah you've got to be kidding me apparently apparently it does Blu-rays I don't know we'll start with a DVD is this gonna get stuck in there it's not eating it uh I don't want to lose this yeah at least it has a good way of connecting to the internet wait does it have Wi-Fi it of course it has Wi-Fi yeah I see you put opera on here is that a hint yeah so that's the newest one that will work I typed these tees together one of them was so delayed that it's at the end of the word oh sophisticated okay well okay with that in mind hold on oh that's so cool oh you can see it's spinning through the little Windows that's awesome that was totally a thing I remember I had a friend that had a Discman that had a window in the top there's no way it's going to play this though because this is a 4K Blu-ray like no no no no no no these are higher density and it's a whole thing even if it had software support there's no way that old drive is going to play it play DVD movie well let's use Windows Media Center obviously man throwback that's kind of like what Steam Big Picture is to gaming but for media on your home theater PC oh wait it's just playing it was that easy there we go this is bar none by far the best sounding laptop that I have ever heard and the touch controls work responsive I am now downloading powerdvd 11 from oldversion.com it has been tested free from spyware adware and viruses Dell premium remote control oh that's the remote control software remote control like I can control this remotely no like it had a remote and the remote was sick because it had a gyroscope in it so you could use it as a mouse as well oh I haven't really talked about the specs of the screen it's 1680 by 1050 which was a common resolution for 20 inch displays at the time uh which is good because it's a 20 inch display that's an aspect ratio of what is that 5x4 or whatever 16x10 that's 16 by 10. yeah in cnet's review they noted that that resolution and aspect ratio was not quite the Holy Grail of 1080p but that it was wide screen and gives plenty of desktop space to display multiple documents side by side 1080p Holy Grail really yeah 16x9 was always worth seeing it always it has a 1.3 megapixel webcam which I guess we can play with while this installs look it's right on them right there quick cam oh it's a Logitech webcam yeah what is this what is this interface video effects no way I can do like AR filters and stuff oh wait maybe you need to open webcam software for this to work okay oh a webcam was not found or is not working properly it's worth noting that at this point we've spent about half an hour trying to get Blu-ray playback working I'm trying to install powerdvd 9 which I had on a drive somewhere um and it's not because the computer is slow you know only 33 CPU usage it's just it involves a lot of hacky workarounds oh the webcam is working now they're not working I would say that that did not improve much at all but In fairness to it this is a modern webcam that frankly doesn't look that much better I almost like the look of the old one more like it feels more natural than this yeah this has a lot of smoothing on it okay and power DVD is still installing okay it is slow but a lot of that is down to the mechanical hard drive oh how big is the hard drive on this thing ah yes 250 gigabytes this shipped with a raid zero Drive configuration that is an awful idea whoa whoa whoa whoa this is your first time playing a beauty ROM title you need to select a region okay region a whoa whoa whoa your graphics card is incompatible what come on what's what's the GPU in this thing x 1800 what the hell is an XO mic it's ATI yeah not AMD ATI r129164.exe seems legit I mean it's off dell.com probably fine all files were successfully unzipped oh okay here we go now that's a name I've not heard in a long time wait was unable to find components that could be installed on your current Hardware please make sure you have the required hardware or software what are you talking about where's device manager oh right you can't do that there yet um yeah but search words so it's fine we found something called do not argue ATI drivers which seems to be a modified version of The Catalyst install manager that is not digitally signed but at least seems to attempt to install so what we're going to do because this was so easy back then is disable driver signature enforcement yay yay okay maybe these are legit but they do sketch me out a little bit you can tell they've altered some stuff I don't know what do notargue.com is maybe something to do with these drivers I know that modified AMD drive or ATI drivers were totally a thing back then the display driver installed success success success error messages I don't see any I mean let's go did we do it maybe crap I think we're worse off than before no we have drivers now but they're not working whereas before we didn't have drivers it was just using Windows drivers but they were working before we try yet another sketchy driver package I threw the Microsoft drivers back on let's see if they're working for 3D acceleration so I don't know if we want to like actually play the game once we get in here apparently this GPU has a little bit of an issue where uh the thermal limits don't really work so it kind of blows itself up oh she's working that's 65 years is that Patrick Stewart yeah God it sounds good have you ever heard bass like that out of a laptop and that's where our story ends so the king of modern laptops this is like the Benchmark the MacBook Pro yeah [Music] sounds like a toy admittedly there is a Clarity advantage to the MacBook Pro but when it comes to sheer hutzpah [Music] that's what eight forward-facing drivers are gonna do for you not to mention the subwoofer should I give up on Blu-ray playback or should we try one more sketchy driver we found one more we could also try a different sketchy Blu-ray player I think we're reaching the end of our options here we tried this weird Leo Blu-ray player and I mean it wasn't officially compatible with Vista anyway so it shouldn't be much of a surprise it didn't work and we couldn't get any other driver package to properly install then we went back to our first solution that we looked at and went ah it sounds like too much trouble let's update the drivers play um here we go let's go it's not a bad looking display for how old it is is this IPS it's Gotta Be You know I bet that's part of why this thing was so expensive my old boss at NCIX had probably the same panel on his desk it was an NEC 20.1 inch IPS that looked amazing compared to anything else at the time and it was glossy just like this yeah I think it might look better not bad why don't we open it up and find out what makes it tick a New Journey is about to begin obviously all the guts are going to be in the bottom of the unit here there's no obvious screws other than this one well look at this Linus 76-page service manual tells you how to take out literally everything oh good so yeah that's the next step it's pretty easy to get it oh whoa that's awesome one screw gets you access to what am I looking at here two ddr2 sodium slots my wireless card which is using I don't know I forget what this standard is called it's certainly not m.2 it would be the older like some kind of mini pcie thing looks like there was an optional secondary slot I don't know what that would have been used for maybe even like like a Mobile SIM card or something like that I'm just guessing at this point and then what did we find if we go deeper wait wow there's a lot of cooling in this thing is this all cooler holy schnikes oh wow look at this you just put a screwdriver in there and the top pops off no way no way okay I think I've got them in do you want to pop it up uh no I don't have it in an oh oh oh hello wait what is happening what is happening okay let's camera it off oh okay one sec okay aha okay what are we looking at now we remove these screws and the whole thing comes off I think okay oh look at this look at this bite oh my goodness what are you compensating for bud and I guess this is where the second hard drive was over here okay here's my Blu-ray Drive mad this is my slime this had to be machined out of a solid freaking piece of aluminum here that was not normal back then that was very unusual there's no way it has to be look at it I mean I'm sure it's not plastic yeah I'm sure I'm sure search your feelings it's aluminum that's not it is yeah I thought you were trying to infected it okay I told you it's metal I know that would just be such an expensive part I know look at the size of these fans too these are huge not dissimilar to the size of a desktop fan I mean an older smaller one still and is there a reason you said that we have to take off the GPU cooler because the GPU will cook itself I also just looked it up so on the Asus zephyrus G14 there's 83 fan blades on their fan this is what model 15 20 maybe 17. nice so this is a Core 2 Duo right which means that it did not have a built-in memory controller so oh whoops the chip that Alex thought was geez by the chip then that Alex thought was the CPU since it has a giant freaking heat pipe strap to it is not in fact the CPU but appears to actually be the motherboard chipset that's where the memory controller was wait is it socketed holy crap it is oh hell yeah in 2005 I built my own laptop I bought an Asus m 5ne I bought a CPU bought Ram you could actually do that you could buy Bare Bones laptops put your own CPU and even mobile chips this isn't a desktop socket this is going to be a mobile chip socket there are daughter boards in this thing that seem to be as big as the main boards on some Modern laptops everything was so much less efficient uh this thing you said it has a 60 watt hour battery 62. yeah okay this with its 50 something watt hour battery managed an hour and a half what does this do probably like eight ten hours 15 like actual real world 15. unbelievable wow there's your CPU oh Linus we could have the only liquid metaled Dell m2010 and then it would die yeah we shouldn't do that okay this is cool check this out this is how these uh mobile sockets worked you have a little slot ah there we go oh and then it slides and then you pop it out yeah just a little something like that and it's a little slidy slide watch this watch this I need like a razor blade how did you get this off I was covered an IPA and then did that heck the thing Alex is concerned about is that our GPU in particular has no built-in thermal protections so if we try to run crisis and this thermal compound does not hold up which it might not we could very well cook it and actually kill it and replacing this thing given that mxm modules were not exactly necessarily always the same from one model to the next very difficult time to throw it back together and see if she does run crisis oh we don't we didn't put the bottom back on oh the bottom uh where did that even go I don't know that doesn't really need it um you might as well yeah we're here but can it play crisis well first it's in a bench ah now what's the point it's gonna take like three hours to run Alex it's fine it's fine because it's cinebench r10 I think oh oh you know I'm kind of curious if there's something obviously Dead about the keyboard how does this come apart Alex will run cinebench and I will do this we will parallelize David yep Alex made this handle so that it will fit my hands and His Hands how impressive is that you're not gonna hold up your hand sure see you know what they say about people with like not huge or anything hands wait shut up this has a removable battery oh wow freaking why this has been running for a while I just started the 15. Alex this is a 14 watt hour battery anyway I just ran Center bench for fun on the XPS 15 but I ran it before but it was plugged in in high performance mode and got a score of 80 000 points and r10 we were able to get a score of 4825 points that's uh yeah 16 times slower than the XPS 15 which is what four times smaller yeah four times lighter but can it run crisis I just paired to the keyboard holy crap you got it to work okay here it is oh yeah it's working oh this is amazing I will play me some Blu-rays ah now I can game on the trackpad uh okay that is not what that is supposed to look like how's my night vision doing hey what's up team this is totally running all low low resolution and everything but it's running oh wow that's uh that is not supposed to be there um we specifically were like okay let's play the game for a little bit longer so we can get to that point where you come out over the hill in the daylight and you you see everything in the distance I don't think that GPU is too happy yeah this is not how this was supposed to go down what I was supposed to do is tell you about our sponsor Squarespace do you think making a website is hard well it is but it doesn't have to be with Squarespace you'll have your website up and running in a matter of hours Squarespace has award-winning templates that'll help make your website Stand Out say goodbye to the drab Geo City's inspired hellscape and say hello to Squarespace plus if you're interested in how your website is doing they have built-in tools to help you find out what you're doing right what you doing wrong both our Linus Media Group and LTX Expo websites were built quickly using Squarespace and if you ever get stuck making your website they have a 24 7 support team ready to help you out so head to squarespace.com LTT and you can get 10 off today if you guys enjoyed this video you might enjoy our recent video on the weird gaming laptop we got from AliExpress weirder no probably not no but very weird [Music]
