but many more are coming soon now let's get back to the video thanks sponsored Gotham my friends let's begin with the battle for first place Andre yeno with the white pieces Hikaru Nakamura with the black pieces Andre plays E4 Hikaru famously defeated Andre yeno several years ago at the Grand Prix a tournament that actually no longer exists but that was one of the earli ways that we determined how somebody would make it to the candidates tournament well yes Peno plays E4 and hikaro historically has responded to this move with the move E5 and hikaro has historically responded to this with the Berlin defense but in this tournament hikaro has shown up to fight and he plays the Sicilian board one with black we're playing on hikaru's terms Knight F3 and this man hikaro plays G6 not the main line with Knight C6 not the main line with D6 or E6 Hikaru plays for an accelerated Dragon not just any he plays for a hyper accelerated dragon with the move Pawn to G6 of course the hyper accelerated Dragon puts a bishop on G7 and a knight on C6 and keeps this move open one of the most common ways to play against it is to play the maroxy structure and against Bishop G7 white plays Bishop E3 Knight C3 and then puts pawns on light squares like this but yeno actually thinks for a little while and plays C3 so he deliberately tries to set up a big Center like this and now we're in an alipin it's as if we played E4 C5 C3 and we get a very locked structure very early look at Yip Peno down 20 minutes on the clock just trying to keep hikaro away from him plays Bishop E2 and hikaro firing at the center with F6 this is not normally what we get in top level chess on board one late into a tournament this is a really provocative game really provocative opening yeno takes both sides castle and my friends hikaro has an open f file he's going to utilize that Bishop E3 played by Andre hikaro thinks for 20 minutes and takes on D4 the computer already wanted black to play Knight H5 completely lose the pawn here and then seiz the entirety of the center like this but this is very risky because if you don't know that this is fine you are kind of just down upon Pawn Knight bd2 looks nice black will play E4 Knight F4 and go for counterplay hikaro does the same exact thing minus the losing of the pawn so this capture allows Knight C3 and hikaro plays Knight H5 Knight F4 he wants the bishop so Andre plays a really nice idea here Rook E1 and Bishop F1 rerouting the bishop ready with Queen D2 Knight C3 and G3 in the future if he wants it hik Caro's next move is can only possibly be described as a mega Giga Chad move and that move is G5 also if for the duration of this recap I uh speak a bit more calmly than normal please don't be scared I think I got sick yesterday I was caught in like freezing rain for like 20 minutes not fun uh also everybody's been sick it's like you know early winter so I might have Co we'll see um hopefully not but I've been getting worse and worse the entire day Knight E5 by the way some points must be given for the move G5 I mean just attacking on the same side if white doesn't respect it G4 and then black gets this big attack Brewing on White's King just awesome stuff from hikaro playing very provocatively yeno putting the knight in the center giving up the pawn yeno straight up just loses a pawn but he has what we call compensation he is compensating for the pawn loss with AC it against hikaru's pieces very powerful Bishop that stares and eyeballs at the weaknesses around hikaru's King Knight A4 played by yeno and look at these cannons pointed this way what a beautiful position by white and now unfortunately I have some bad news in chess when an Unstoppable Force meets an immovable object white is down a pawn but to compensate white has ridiculously active pieces a lot of threads Brewing sometimes the game unfortunately Peter out in this position if white plays Bishop D3 and tries to play Queen H5 black will consolidate and actually attack white first so sadly yes penko is forced to sacrifice the bishop and the game ends in a draw because his alternative was to just play on down a pawn honestly not a very like fun game in the sense that it was over before it started but he Karu is playing for a win with with both colors every game I mean you have got to love what Hikaru is bringing every single round and yes aeno did as well he played provocatively he played Knight E5 and had to you know fight back being a pawn down but with some active pie it's everything you want my friends like look you know sometimes that's what happens uh we keep moving we have some really fun games uh yuang G versus arjent erigi this one's actually going to be over very quickly the recap of this one arjin with the black pieces tied for first place Yu yangi is a half a point behind but they all they all need an opponent these guys bust out a bunch of opening Theory Yu yangi takes on the queen side and then watch I don't think you have ever seen a position ever like this before on move 15 of this game Argent regi plays Pawn to C5 targeting White Center White can take or take or take or take or take and black meanwhile can take or take or take or take or take and take and also take and if take then take so what do the sides do well of course white takes and then takes and then takes and then takes and then takes and then takes and then takes and then takes and then takes and then takes and then takes and then takes and then takes and then takes and then takes and then takes what can somebody find the record for how many captures in a row have happened in a chess game 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 have 16 captures ever occurred in a chess game ever in a row did I I didn't say in a row right in a row what anyway I think you kind of get it yeah look sometimes my friends what happens I mean like sometimes the dudes just want to go to the dinner buffet before you know and get the first plate that's just how it works dude said I'm out listen ered iy can make these draws he's in first place now couple of games that weren't draws vid gudra Hans Neeman and Fabiano Carana versus yvi nyer all right here we go vidit with the white pieces Hans coming off of a very very close game against Ali Resa where he had winning chances then a nice win against report where he played at 98% accuracy but I embellished it to 100% accuracy for clickbait purposes um E4 E5 not for the other stuff going to be talking about this in every recap at this point I'm waiting for hikaro to win a game with 100% accuracy you best believe I am making a video called hikara Nakamura wins with 100% accuracy Knight F3 Knight C6 Bishop B5 A6 uh and we get by the way important important important uh against Fabiano Hans went here and Hans has played the Berlin in this tournament before uh and against Fabiano he's played Berlin also previously plays into a regular Spanish he plays into a Spanish without moving his deep pa okay plays into a Spanish he doesn't actually play D6 which is the which is the mainline move order he plays the the move order where he is leaving the option to play D5 and vidit plays one of multiple anti-ar Marshals like A4 or H3 plays A4 this is called an anti Marshal because black is going to be forced to play the move Pawn to D6 and that is what happens all right Queen D7 all of this has happened before Hans plays Knight d8 and generally what's going to happen when these pawns are here is that there's going to be action on the queen side right so vidit takes notice how vid's not thinking Hans is thinking a little bit vid's still not thinking vidit is still not thinking Knight E vidit still not thinking he takes the Knight because the queen is defending both pawns and that would force black to take with the pawn vid plays B4 all of this is prep this this kind of like freezes the pawn on the B B5 Square the bishop is sort of stuck black might need to play D5 to activate the bishop he can't really play D5 to activate the bishop before because the pawn here is hanging so he's going to try to Route the bishop backwards vidit has now played 17 moves without even thinking because modern chess is dead Queen to B2 and he has still not spent any time now he trades the Rooks he has spill still SP I think he spent two minutes there because he went to get some water Rook A1 Queen now please V V think on your own and he does for 20 minutes okay terrific um yeah so vidit gets out of the opening on the 20 first move because modern chess is Cesspool um very difficult to play chess uh when uh you know your opponent has memorized 20 moves credit to Hans to getting you know to this position and now white is going to try to bully you over here the computer gives G4 and then the computer gives G5 and then the computer says King G2 King G8 because stockfish is essentially out of ideas and just wants to go to the dinner buffet with Ari and Yu yangi uh Queen A7 and queen A5 and at this point Hans basically starts like shuffling the pieces around he's like I I'm Rock Solid good luck Bishop A7 Bishop d8 V goes Queen A6 Hans repeats moves VI goes Bishop B8 Huns repeats moves VI goes Knight B1 and to be honest with you the computer just says Shuffle back and forth but suddenly this configuration of piece say give stockfish hope and stockfish is like wait a minute what about this Knight rerouting it's a very close position the Knight can reroute and then there's possibilities so Han starts playing a little bit more energetically and Bishop d8 and then plays Queen E8 which clearly seems to be some sort of unraveling idea now meanwhile vidit anticipating an attack here does something really clever vidit sneaks the king away what what dude is just playing king of he's going to run his King to B1 or what I mean what is going on here King vidit what are these guys doing dudes are straight up playing like some sort of challenge chest like you know they're playing as if a viewer said make three King moves in a row and I'll give you $1,000 like what why are they just moving I can't explain this stuff to you you know what I mean queen D said now V go what what is going on KN G8 vidit finally does this plan this has been the plan for a while I don't know why why he needed to do a little Macarena dance with his King and now he goes back to E2 to safeguard the Knight and now Hans plays D5 at this point I thought oh my God Hans is taking over the game vid's got no time look at this look at Hans taking over Queen H5 check which apparently is a mistake apparently black is not the one calling the shots yet black needs to just stay back and relax but Hans goes for it and then does this and that allows vid to just get a little bit closer and here Hans makes a huge mistake um 20 6 minutes versus four this was H's biggest moment of the game I think he really Hans is a fighter uh he wants to like keep as much tension in the position as possible so instead of taking uh and maybe trading a bunch of pieces he decides to go here probably anticipating Knight E4 or queen E4 check but just this move and suddenly black can't move any pieces and he hunts vidit King but but vid is completely safe vidit broke through and Hans can't move anything he just cannot make a move one bad Pawn trade vidda gets in there we go to a to an end game but it's it's not it's not even an end game it's it's a massive assault on the black position it's still holdable apparently if you play here and then Knight F3 but uh Hans goes like this and and this is just wrong and um Knight D2 Bishop F6 is game over that's mate that's a hanging Bishop and white is completely safe and Hans resigns vid it wins a big game versus Hans nean I mean what more can you ask uh from him like I said instead of the immediate Knight F3 check the computer was giving Bishop D7 first and then Knight F3 so F4 Knight F3 the difference was in the game King C3 happened Queen H1 you got to lose the bishop and then actually black is winning because because of this so Queen D7 can't be played uh White would have had to play something else like Knight B3 and then Queen E1 check I mean you can follow this absurd Engine line all the way down here and then the bishop is defended so I'm just glad I'm not playing the games myself now Fabiano Carana made a couple of draws cooled off a little bit playing White against yevi ner from Russia it's an Italian how fitting Fabby going back to his roots Bishop look at black playing an Italian by bringing out the bishop and then bringing the bishop back he's doing that because he wants to deal with the pin Bishop G3 right Knight bd2 and this setup is very odd but I'm imagining that the bishop is going to come here or the king is going to come up the Knight is going to go to H5 and the pawn will go to F5 so H3 ner strikes on the queen side and we get a very imbalanced game look at Fabby look at Fab's prep Fabby barely spending any time in the opening ner also on his own now he's been on his own there's Knight H5 I told you that that was happening and then ner plays Bishop G5 that's a wild move wow trying to play Bishop F4 and then get in with his Knight you know white doesn't want to take not just Queen G5 being scary this might be scary too cuz the knight's going right there the Knight is going to go to F4 and that is very unpleasant if Bishop takes you got e takes you got G takes they both look pretty good so ner playing a very very aggressive Italian getting in there into Fabiano's position with the Knights that Knight is going to come to F4 at some point Fabby needs to figure something out the one good thing that Fabiano has in this position is the a file and he makes use of it and in trading off The Rook to try to get Fab's pressure off the a file fabbi turns his Focus to the other side of the board it's still very equal But Here Comes The breakr Big Moment In the game ner it takes allows the knight in and hits it from the side Rook to E4 Knight F6 and now Knight takes Bishop I don't think ner missed this tactic I think he went for this deliberately but yeah the idea of Rook E4 was just to win this and if you took here B4 removing the defender a deflection and a removing the defender tactic Knight to F6 hit uh hit the Rook but didn't take away the threat on the bishop and I mean if ner had played Bishop B6 game would have went on but my friends eight times out of 10 two pieces are better than the Rook he didn't take because he would lose the rook and uh yeah I mean Fabby just has a bishop and a knight and and maybe ner thought this position was okay but let me tell you it is definitely not okay look at Fabby bringing his pieces back it's just too many pieces Bishop D3 and in this position ner just resigned he literally just resigned he resigned because he's going to lose D4 and then he's going to lose everything else he could go here and then he could play here it's not good enough White's white defends everything every Pawn in White's position is defended look you can't touch wh's pawns you know whose pawns you can't touch Black's pawns and that's what Fabiano is going to do one after the other and Fabby also gets in line at the dinner buffet big win for Fabby he now rejoins the leaders it is a massive tie for first let's keep it rolling this is the game for first place again on the women's side yesterday bibisara defeated tanang y today she is playing Anam we've seen multiple people involved in these Recaps including the musuk sisters by the way who exclusively play the alipin Sicilian which kind of drives me insane cuz it's too solid of an opening for my liking and we've seen it used by like multiple players now to subdue Hikaru but black plays a line that Hikaru played already earlier in this tournament Knight takes D4 and Bishop G4 giving away the bishop for the Knight and getting a very comfortable setup okay in fact getting the bishop off the board just a equal position but what does white have here pressure just a little bit of queenside pressure same side castling bishops come off the board same side pressure B4 restricting the Black Knight putting the Knight into the center of the board we go to a queen and Knight end game all white has here is a little bit of activity that's all she has and a little bit of a majority she has three on two doubled B pawns but she could play things like B5 okay G4 black plays Queen E7 Black's been passive the whole game a little bit too passive Queen D4 you got to be passive and massive you can't just be passive King G8 white just goes creeps forward you can't take this pawn it looks like you can but there's check King G7 and then there's here guarding this guarding this hitting that hitting that and that's bad cuz after Queen f8 black is going to lose this pawn and then probably lose the the game so musuk is just pressuring slow look at this nice idea to trade the Queens into some form of a three on two endgame she's claiming she's going to play for a win there bisad just playing a little bit little bit slow little bit too passively now it's a two-on-one it's a two-on-one majority all right Knight D6 bibisara still trying to fight back and she does oh my goodness what a what a mistake an amazing move B6 to win the pawn and that's it but now Queen B6 okay but we we are like in very close to drawing territory now all white has as a B Pawn is white actually going to be able to run away with it oh my goodness Queen H3 Queen D4 check she deflects the pawn she's down to two how's she going to do this this is not winnable oh my God bibisara has to make he has to give checks check check does she have a draw does she have a draw the king is now running to the dile is it a draw Queen B6 apparently black had to be active or play E5 by going backwards you allow white to creep forward black now strikes back but the queen trade the threat of a queen trade is everything here Queen A5 and now Queen F6 check oh my goodness she is losing the pawns she is losing the pawns and once she loses the pawns the B Pawn is going to go and the King walks up the board gets shielded from the checks and F4 seals the deal you're going to win this pawn and if Queen F4 it's takes takes and white wins the race Anam musuk defeats the leader and now leads the women's Grand Swiss with five points out of six crazy stuff going on over there crazy stuff going on over here as well Sam Sean javak sarov a game for first place an offbeat Kings Indian move order doesn't really matter Center opens up Knight F6 Bishop E3 look at sarov what the heck is sarov doing what is this but sarov plays D5 looking to rip open White Center take take long Castle Knight C6 we have a trade and the bishop takes the center but Sam Sean should not have taken the Knight that did two things number one it opened up Black's B file and number two it strengthened black center Bishop D4 now we see the justification of the B file and seon here takes and instead of just playing a dead symmetrical like you know everything is kind of locked up and no in this position synov activates some sort of Jutsu and instead of taking back on D5 he sacrifices the pawn it looks like a mouse slip I mean it literally looks like instead of taking you Mouse slip the pawn the longer you let stockfish think the more it sits there and goes oh sh C five deflects the bishop off of the diagonal here comes the queen here comes the bishop sacrificing The Rook completely you can't even take it because you cannot feasibly stop my attack stockfish can but stockfish is not a player at the Grand Swiss and seon says get out of my territory but after it takes Knight takes D5 and my friends it takes just 23 three moves javir sarov Absa lute Lee destroys Sam seon and I like Sam seon I can't believe that just happened that came out of nowhere 40 minutes up on the clock white resigned he resigned because Rook D1 Queen B2 is literally Checkmate and if you do this black is just going to give you a check and win your Rook seavon basically tried to subdue the black position he basically got to a Spiderman I kind of don't like how active black is getting so let's trade some pieces and be solid and javak here said nope Bishop F5 this a couple of moves in a row like this and and white must be like uhoh right and look at 18 minutes spent Bishop F5 oh my desperate times call for desperate measures Rook C8 Knight I mean just what a game what a game if Knight if this black would have went Rook takes C3 oh my and queen C3 Queen B2 mate javak here Sara beats Sam Savon in 23 moves and is tied for first place and that is not the end Alexander prka from Russia Sam seon from the United States and don't go anywhere if you want to click off this video I have a massive update about about Raman janov we are ending every single one of these damn Recaps with a mention of the 20-year-old photol International master from Kazakhstan maybe the greatest player of all time at this point all right I stand ramazan it has been six rounds and you better not miss the last recap that I have for you of him this game Preta versus Shanklin very very cuttingedge Theory here Gambit line where white is down upon but black is behind in development look at this look at prka prka won a beautiful attacking game earlier in the event against oh against Duda look at this move because if Pawn takes you got rookie six but everything is fine shanklin's got everything under control what but he loses the rook in the corner so prka loses a bishop on F4 for the rook in the corner and now it's a matter of will black win the night as well because if black fails to win the night he's going to lose the game Shanklin plays Bishop C8 he did that to safeguard his Pawn PR and here comes pra's Knight pra's Knight is going to here and here right D3 E5 and F7 takes the king slides over to go after the Knight it's like one of those bank heist movies you know like the casino ones where it's a set amount of time you know the the the king is about to arrive and take right Queen E2 Queen D6 and there's a golden rule of chess if a person can make a move that looks completely impossible either they're 500 like you or it's over 1 2 3 4 literally the most covered Square in the black position I suppose also D7 oink you cannot take with the c Pawn because of this you cannot take with the queen because of this you cannot take with the Knight because of this if takes the mate if Queen takes Rook skewer to d8 so you have to take with the e- pawn but this is brutal you can't take because of this you can't take because of this and if you take like this queen E7 Rook D1 Rook d8 my friends Alexander prka absolutely Slaughters the black position here Knight G6 check Knight back to F4 the queen bouncing around Queen G5 Queen C6 prka wins both Rooks it's two Rooks versus two knights and a bishop but the black king is in dire straights and now prka comes back for the pawns that a pawn might decide all end games now Shanklin doing a nice job trying to fight back with his Knights but his King's just a little too weak we barely make it to move 40 but both sides have made their 40th move and queen C4 Queen B2 the queen is stuck it's got to go here or here and both of those moves on the game Alexander PR could defeat Sam shankland he's tied for first and ramazan janov is a 20-year-old International master from Kazakhstan who has defeated a 2650 Alan picho a 2680 basam Amin Drew Aliva fua 2777 Drew Alexis s 2680

perennial top 10 player formerly number two in the world and I'm just gonna I'm just going to scroll through some moves caroan and solid opening white Maybe point two better Bishop versus knight and ramazan janov incurs absolutely zero risk makes absolutely no mistakes plays an absolutely solid game completely neutralizes Anish giri's efforts at being provocative in aaran look at him methodically like the Terminator walk his opponent down make absolutely no blunders good resistance because Anish gir is rated 2760 and this game ends after 80 moves and some more shuffling Unstoppable Force immovable object Raman janov has not lost this man just drew Anish giri he Drew Ali fua this man cannot be stopped this is Sublime I have this is the greatest performance by a 20 by a 2500 player
