so I haven't seen this one I saw him just release this I'm happy that fireship is back let's get this thing going 2023 has been a wild Year my bank collapsed Elon bought Twitter almost all my friends got laid off all my favorite crypto Bros are going to jail Tesla successfully made it the DeLorean with a Pontiac Aztec bringing us the Cyber truck and chat GPT made me obsolete but all this good news pales in comparison to the changes web developers those are all things that happened like like that perfectly does sum up 2023 you know they're all going to jail all the crypto the rug the official rug pole rug pole has been pulled and now look at us this beautiful this is beautiful I would say that the s that the Sam B freed bankman situation SB sfb or s i I can never say his name correct there's a dash and there's like a lot of them um there's too many names for one human to have uh Sam my favorite part about that entire Saga was the fact that they had Wang write a back door back door Wang in the code and then not only did he do that not only did he write it he like put nice commit commit messages like backdoor Wang coming in with a good oldfashioned back door and you're just like damn why you got to put that in the commit messages Sam Sam why you why you letting backdoor Wang do that to you like he just like just just just straight up documented backdooring it was beautiful it was beautiful all right let's keep on going seen in JavaScript land over the last year where almost every framework decided to reinvent itself in 2023 in today's video we'll look yes 2023 was the year that everybody became a nextjs framework what do you spelt how about spelt kit hey what do you solid solid starter whatever it's called hey what what are you view I don't know what views is but I'm sure Vue has one what are you angular you have signals now you know like I don't know what it all was but there's there's been a lot of them that are all doing the same thing no what are you view you noon okay we're nting out here look at 10 recent changes I don't know why I turn it into like an old Hollywood Italiano mobster what are you what's going on have you talked to Fat Tony about that like I don't know why what's going on here but all of a sudden it's just like the moment I start talking about JavaScript Frameworks I I turn into a stereotypical mobster is to JavaScript that you may have missed every year new language features get standardized in ecmascript at which point they're implemented in browsers one of my favorite new features this year is object Group by imagine you have an array of objects where the objects share a similar schema these might be records from a database where every object has a field of age you can use groupy to separate the children from the adults by defining a function that groups anyone under 21 into children and anyone over that into adult the end result is an object organized into groups that's a nice little utility but when I find myself using I don't know how I feel about that one I I'm still trying to figure out like why you know you know there's like there's like see there's squeal you've heard of squeal right and you can do like group eyes and and stuff in your database which is written in in in in a fast language and so when I see this it's like M more data processing doesn't sound better than less data processing in JavaScript that's useful for no JS and no squeal yeah no squeal was largely a mistake just saying over that into adults the end result is an object organized into groups that's a nice little utility but when I find myself using even more often is array two sorted along with two spliced and two reversed this is hilarious I love the fact that because JavaScript is a language in which you don't know if a function mutates you now have reverse and two reversed ah beautiful JavaScript already had methods for sort and reversed but the problem is that they mutate the original array in place and that's confusing because other methods like map and filter don't do that instead they copy the array and return a new one with these methods you can now sort reverse and SP did we not get like a oh my goodness they should do two map that does mutating like I feel like that would be the only way that JavaScript could remain so consistently inconsistent that the only way to do this is to make mutating ones called two map and two filter like to me that that's the way that's the way if they're going to commit to this consistently inconsistent Behavior that's the way that is the way treating the original as an immutable value which tends to be the more sane way to write your code web developers also got some cool updates I don't know if it's more sayane I love I you know I immutability is definitely a Hot Topic among you young you young JS devs it's just that maybe a better language for it would be would be nicer you guys just want to be a bunch of hascal nerds without being virgins and so I think there's like a problem here it's like you want all the benefits of hll without the best benefit The Virginity part in the form of brand new HTML Elements by the way that is going to make the entire hasal Community all 21 of them super upset I'm I'm pretty sure I'm going to appear in a white paper the proximity of virginity and hll where they disprove my theory there's going to be graphs there's going to be an abstract it's going to be so amazing dude if you if you actually look at it it's actually two standard deviations more likely for virginity but if you think about it the this isn't a normal distribution It's actually an AB distribution of virginity okay it's different they actually go into two different categories it's post virgin Hess or prever virgin Hess okay you really need to understand the difference dude it's going to be so good it's going to be so good the search tag is a more semantic way to define a search box on a website which can replace the more generic form tag that's nice but the dialogue element is way more powerful which allows you to create actual modal dialogues and then control them with JavaScript using built-in methods like show modal and close another nice that okay finally thank you for just I really would like more leaning into like the first off Modells are a modals models uh however you say it uh I feel like they're a mistake to begin with almost exclusively you create a website in which you cannot replicate that state I've largely thought them to be bad uh I'm happy that you now have like specific HTML around it at least that does put some sanity back into things that this this really crazy odd behavior can be specified in a more nice way I'm happy about that I'm curious about how this works it's quite old I don't know about it sorry I don't keep up with the HTML you know like obviously we read that one where it showed how stupid we all were with HTML like I just don't keep track of HTML stuff a mistake uh we have Marquee but not dialogue I just just saying utility but that brings us to index 3 after years of begging and pleading with Apple iOS finally allows push notifications to come from web apps and that's a huge win for the 0.00001% of website users who actually allow websites to send them push notifications which yep that's me I do it every time this thing shows up I'm like no thank you is most likely your grandpa who accidentally clicked the allow button and now has no idea how to turn it off but now it's time to talk about the fun stuff Frameworks the world's most popular JavaScript framework nextjs is an entirely different framework than it was last year thanks to the app directory which became stable in May with version 13.4 the most notable difference is that you can now fetch data directly inside react components thanks to Ser I'm very happy that at least it's trying to encourage you to write squeal this is good I do love that people like I think template strings are interesting it's kind of a cool way to allow Behavior inside of a template uh data I like that I think we can all agree that that's pretty nice um I'm curious what this actually looks like how does a I've never implemented a template string so you must get the chance to to like do a mutation on this data before it gets put into the actual template litting so neat neat but about that squeal injection no see no no no no no stop saying that if you if you say the word squeal injection you're just being a dumb dumb okay always ask a question before you just claim an outcome right that's that's what you need to do always ask a question before you claim an outcome just once maybe twice maybe three times components which react components that can run on the server the reception to the app directory has been somewhat mixed on one hand it has a lot of awesome new features and can simplify your code but many have complained about it feeling rushed and Half Baked kind of like the way they launch video games nowadays where they just get something out the door then patch it up over the next few years wh why is this Western man twerking on this guy's boot what is this I don't want boot twerk video game okay that's not what I want I don't want this it's not even twerking I don't even know what this is grinding we're grinding we're we're shoe grinding we're shoe shining did I just did I just make up a new dance move the shoe shine I think I might have we're going to call that the shoe shine babies uh let's go on people have complained about having to use the used client directive everywhere due to Breaking existing react libraries people have complained about the slow Dev server which is powered by rust which is weird because anything powered by rust is supposed to be fast and people have compared its new server actions feature to to PHP one of the most offensive slurs you can make against a JavaScript framework but the biggest issue is that running nextjs is fairly hard to do correctly outside of versel and I I've heard this is this has been a bit exaggerated uh like the thing that makes versel really useful is that they they they spawn up all the edging you get to be a public Edge Lord like you get to do all the stuff that you need and they they handle all the infrastructure whereas running nextjs I heard it's pretty easy a throat in a Docker image and blah blah blah blah like I hear it's it's been pretty exaggerated uh the thing is is that running nextjs and having versel are very different things and so I think the pro it's it's Express right yeah it's like it's not like something wildly out of control it they just read your directory and write an Express server that maps to your directory like is it really that wild there's some other things obviously uh but I'm just saying like is it really that crazy that's led to projects like open next that take on the tedious job of getting it to run anywhere next is no no that's that yeah it's it's more that it's it's doing the whole like serverless part I could I bet you in an afternoon I could make an nextjs Docker niess or in five minutes finding the docker image that exists that you just run right but that's then you then you're you're manually running the server and people don't want to do that in this day and age they want someone else to they want to pay more money for somebody else to do it the dominant meta framework but nujs and the view ecosystem also had a lot of cool updates in like it's Dev tools these press one in the chat if you think view is amazing people seem to love view every time I hear anyone talk about view they seem to just love it lot of ones okay yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it just seems so surprising people seem to love view tools run directly in the browser and make it much easier to understand the structure of a complex application if this is your application and you don't immediately think I done [ __ ] up I don't know what you I I like I don't know what's going through your head right yeah this is this is just how you write client side applications this is there's no other possible way there's no other possible way to write them it does this this looks like obsidian but it's not it does actually look like it's not obsidian but one thing you may not know about n is that many of its components are available through the unified JavaScript tools ecosystem like if you don't care about VJs and just want a web server you can use Nitro to build a fast server with plain JavaScript what's funny is I think the VJs ecosystem has changed the least in 2023 and as a consequence it feels like the most stable and predictable ecosystem spelt on the other hand got rued in 2023 in a shocking announcement a couple months ago spelt announced a new feature called runes that will dramatically change the developer experience in version 5 instead of defining reactive variables with let there's now this thing called a rune which is essentially a compiler macro that tells the spelt compiler this value is reactive spelt is also getting rid of the dollar sign [ __ ] syntax and stores with runes like derived and effect the initial probably just makes it a lot easier to honestly the compiler and what you can do is probably just a lot easier than having this whole like using labels and running blocks and stuff like that like I I think that it it does make things easier because you need less of a compiler now like this this exists now this is just JavaScript as opposed to conf like translating a scope block plus a label into well an effect right I I like Chang were some with some users feeling like these changes Mak spel look a lot more like react which is the type of developer experience they're trying to get away from but on the other hand a lot of people love these changes and see them as necessary to evolve the framewor in the right direction as a hardcore user of spell myself I'm waiting for the final release of version 5 before I form an opinion the award for the most Chang framework in 2023 though goes to angular signals baby let's go it has a long list of new features but the most notable by the way uh up to 90% faster runtime built with in control flops I don't whenever someone says something's faster I just don't believe it until you till you measure it changes for angular haters out there would be the new template syntax which provides a cleaner way to handle conditionals and Loops replacing things like ngf and ng4 in addition angular has also adopted signals much like all the other Frameworks out there and brings a new feature called defer views which enables decare lazy loading directly in a template but most importantly angular has a brand new logo which was really the only thing holding it back from being the world's most popular framework in the past a lot of crazy changes on the front end but on the back end no. JS has been quietly getting better with no. JS version 20 it released a new permissions model which improves security by controlling which features a script has access to much similar to yeah I was about to say that sounds like Dino Dino has like kind of built-in permissions and all that so okay cool cool dino changing the uh ecosystem good job Dino released a few years ago and then with the release of note 21 it introduced its own websocket client which is based on the websocket API in the browser the biggest disruptor with backend JavaScript in 2023 though is BU it's a new javascri interesting that they did that because uh micro cuz microweb sockets are already exists U web sockets and they're that's what bun uses and they're really well written and they're fast right I like that like I I I think we should try to go towards something that's that's good you know one time written in Zig that came out with an awesome developer experience and some wild claims about performance and quite a few bugs were discovered after the initial release but it still remains a promising new way to do backend JavaScript in the future and with that we've looked at 10 different ways JavaScript changed in 2023 but I almost forgot the biggest one of all htms the framework that showed us that anyone can capture the imagination of the JavaScript ecosystem if you [ __ ] post and meme hard enough on Twitter but most importantly as I've shown here with science HTM X can actually eliminate a ton of JavaScript compared to the status quo approach taken by all the major Frameworks it's the ideal JavaScript framework for the JavaScript haters and that's why today I'm thrilled and honored to present the HTM X team with the JavaScript framework of the Year award which is basically the Nobel Prize of JavaScript thanks for watching and I will see you in the next one that is so good I think h MX deserves it HTM X deserves it absolutely loved it the name is the HTM X agent
