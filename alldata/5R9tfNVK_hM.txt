getting your film making questions answered especially early on in your career can be really difficult I didn't go to film school and so I remember when I was just starting out I had so many questions I couldn't find the answers to anywhere I remember spending hours and hours on Google trying to figure out how to solve my problems and more often than not I just couldn't and even though I do my best to solve as many problems for you as possible in these videos since I can only put out one a week it's pretty much impossible to answer them all so I asked you guys what you were struggling with the most and in this video I'm going to try and answer as many of them as I can and hopefully make your lives as filmmakers just a little bit easier and just in case your first question is where are you right now I'm still up here in the Canadian Arctic on the side of a tributary of the MacKenzie River and I'm here for at least another 6 weeks and know I haven't changed my clothes since the last video though you may be happy to know that I'm at least keeping my socks and underwear fresh that's disgusting it's also really cold out here so just so I don't freeze to death I'm going to take you guys for a bit of a walk while I answer the first few questions okay so the first round of questions here is going to come from members of the community group for people who enrolled in the documentary cinematography course then I'm going to move on to the broader YouTube Community the course filled up in like 4 days or something like that so it's still closed for now because I wanted to keep the size intentionally small so I can actually interact with people uh so if you want to get your questions answered a little bit faster you might want to get your name on that weight list there's a link in the description and I'll open it up sometime in January or around there anyways I'm going to start off here with one from Thomas who is actually a runner up for my mentorship program last year and from what I can see has been working super hard ever since Thomas asks how do you shoot on other people's films when you're used to the freedom of working on your own projects like how do you ignore your own ideas and focus on someone else's Vision instead it's a great question and something that most filmmakers will have to deal with because the reality is the majority of us won't be able to support ourselves doing only what we want almost all of us are going to need day jobs which means taking assignments for other people and shooting in a way that may may or may not be in line with our creative instincts and Thomas for me it comes down to recognizing that reality of Life as a filmmaker is not always perfect and that some days you're just at work like if you had a normal 9 to-5 job doing data entry or something you'd have to do things that someone else tells you to do that might not necessarily line up with what you choose to do with your time I happen to think that film making is a lot more fun than most jobs out there but that doesn't mean it's not a job at times I definitely struggled with this at different points in my career when I disagree with the direction that a director was taking or when a project was released and it was way different I.E worse than I thought it would be but at the end of the day we all need to make money and for filmmakers that normally means taking jobs on other people's shoots and in those situations I just tell myself today I'm at work and I take a deep breath and focus on being the best asset to the team that I can you can almost make it a game how easy can I be to work with today or how much can I support the director's Vision or how can I leave here making the best possible impr pression on the crew then you take that money and use it to make a film in exactly the way you want okay let me find a place to get out of the wind for a second and I'll move on to the next [Music] one next up is from Ryan Holland who asks when do you censor things in your film I.E when is it morally incorrect to show certain things this is a great question and something we all have to find our own position on basically my take is that we should always tell the truth but when possible air on the side of kindness like for example I was shooting a feature film last summer and some of the characters I was following would party really hard on their nights off and sometimes do things that were let's just say not legal that was all part of their experience and they were open enough to show it to me honestly but in the end I made the conscious decision not to film anything that would negatively impact the rest of their lives I don't know where that film will end up and even though it might have been dramatic TV to show someone doing drugs most of them were just young adults having fun and if I'd shown them doing certain things I easily could have done lasting damage to their lives like what if someone wanted to go out and be a teacher but because they let me into their story and I put them on Netflix or something doing illegal things they weren't able to get a job for me that just didn't add enough to the story to justify the harm I could do like it was still very possible to show the essence of the party lifestyle without physically showing them ingesting drugs and so I made the decision not to show any of that stuff but everyone will have to make their own decision when it comes to things like this and there's also going to be times when it's absolutely Justified to show the ugly truth even if it hurts someone only you can make the decision when that is but if you just remember to be honest but strive for kindness when possible I think you'll get it right most of the time okay next up AE asks how important is the editing process and should we edit raw footage every day after shooting well right off the bat I'd say that editing is where the story really takes place in Doc and that it's incredibly important for the final product in narrative films editing is also super important obviously but for the most part the story has been decided in advance right down to the story boards in Ducks we might have a rough idea or even a good idea of where the story is going but we end up shooting a lot more sometimes hitting shooting ratios of like 100 or one to more meaning that for every minute of footage used we shoot 100 total minutes and that number can go way up like I shot over 400 hours last summer for a 90-minute dock so finding the real story inside all of that is going to happen in post with that said I usually still try to know the general spine of my story before I start so it's not just about spraying and praying and then figuring it out later but you will inevitably end up shooting way more than you need and finding unexpected gold in there so in short the edit is massive in docks when it comes to editing footage every day that sounds great in theory but in reality I'm almost always way too tired to do that well it usually makes a lot more sense to set up a really good backup workflow but I don't bother actually editing anything until I'm done with with the shoot for me it's much better to save my mental and physical energy to focus on the shoot days and then set aside days after the fact to come through it all next up Fernando asks what does good pre-production look like on a big feature now this one's a bit tough to answer because it's always a little different but most good pre-pro involves knowing a few key things before you start shooting that means the director should have a Clear Vision about the story they're setting out to tell so by that I mean there is a story not just a topic they should also know who the main characters are and what they're trying to achieve big Productions have tooo many crew members and every day in the field is too expensive to just go out there and shoot aimlessly that doesn't mean that you need to know exactly what's going to happen or that there's no room to explore new ideas or characters as they come up but you want to be shooting to a solid plan and then allow it to change not arrive the full crew and hope to find something there for the director and producer pre-pro means working together to define the story establish the characters and then work out the logistics for how it's going going to happen that means a ton of back and forth and lots of conversations when things are a little more clearly defined then it's time to bring in a DP and start talking about the visual themes and style there's no real rules about when this should happen or how many meetings need to take place but the bigger the cost and the higher the pressure the more meetings and talking ahead of time the smoother things are going to run in the field but even at a much smaller scale most successful docs spend more time on pre-pro than you might think and it's usually never a good idea to just show up and start rolling okay it looks like there's some rainclouds rolling in so I'm going to move one more time and see if I can't find a little bit of cover to finish this [Music] off okay the next question is from Saul Morales who asks what's the best approach to convince someone who doesn't want to be a character in your documentary well unfortunately for me the answer is to move on I almost never try and convince anyone who's opposed to being in the dock because the reality is that you will need so much vulnerability and cooperation from them in order to tell a good story that they're usually going to get irritated and walk away it can be tempting to see the perfect character on paper and think if only I can get them to change their mind I'm going to have an amazing story but making a dock requires so much collaboration with your characters that you really need them to be invested in taking part this is different if you're doing something like Michael Moore where he is often in an adversarial relationship with the subjects but if you want your characters to willingly take part my best advice is to work with people who want to let you in without needing to be convinced you're going to want to film with people in the most intimate and difficult moments of their lives and people who are convinced against their will are normally the ones who will shut down and lock you out in exactly the moments when you need them to work with you the most I know that's frustrating to hear but it's rare to have a successful collaboration with someone who doesn't want to participate so I'd say you should probably just move on most of the time as much as that hurts all right hold on my shoulder's killing me I have no idea how vloggers do this but I guess they probably don't hold fully built out fx3 rigs but I think I see a little clearing up ahead head just give me one [Music] second okay so that clearing was a bust uh but I think the rain's going to hold off it's just a light drizzle and I found this cool log so just thought I'd finish it up here I mean look how cool this is this is one of the best things about this job is you get to come out here and be exposed to environments like this that I have no business being in and probably will never get to come back to so still love this job even after all these years in case you were wondering this next question is from Matt who wants to know how to start laying out an edit should you start with a roll and then layering on from there is the basics of his question this is a good one because if you've ever been faced with a blank timeline and a ton of footage you'll know it can lead to deep despair for me it really depends on what kind of dock I'm making and how long it is but the very first thing I do is make dailies or string outs or whatever you want to call them if you don't know what that is I made a video not long ago that you can check out I'll link to in the description but basically it's a bunch of timelines of 5-second clips of everything you've shot so that you can scan through it all very quickly while also getting to know your footage in the process once I have those made then I'll try and start editing in terms of scenes rather than in one unbroken timeline I'll start a new timeline for the opening and then a new one for each individual scene in the film and then string them all together in the end to make one cohesive edit starting with the a-roll is a good idea generally speaking and it's a great place to start but in the long term you're going to want to be thinking about telling your story through a series of scenes ideally not just alternating between interview and b-roll now that said creating an a-roll spine is a great idea because it will show the core of your story so all of that is a long-winded way to say yes start with your a-roll but down the road if at all possible we want to show and not tell our story and that means following our characters as they experience life rather than hearing them explain it through an interview interviews are still valuable and pure verit film making is really hard so don't stress if you're not doing this exactly right now but it's a good long-term goal I use interviews all the time in my projects but I do try to use them as little as possible to varying degrees of success okay next is a question from Wildlife Louie which I really hope is your legal name uh who's asking for tips on how to go full-time from production company to freelancing well Wildlife or perhaps you prefer Mr Louie my first tip to you would be to save as much cash as you possibly can freelancing is incredibly up and down and if you're used to a regular paycheck it can be really easy to panic when the money stops coming in for a few months like it definitely will I generally like to stash away at least 6 months of operating cash and the more you're able to weather a storm like a pandemic for example the longer you'll be able to stay in the game the next thing I'd say about freelancing is it's all about networking if people don't know who you are the job offers just aren't going to come in that means Plastering your name all over town because for the most part people aren't going to find you through a website anymore now obviously there is a chance but there's usually so much competition for Google searches for like New York videographer or London documentary filmmaker or whatever that you can't rely on people finding you that way to really Thrive as a freelancer you want Word of Mouth to work for you more than anything and the best way to get get that going is to meet with as many people as possible and keep your name at the top of their mind that means sending as many emails booking as many meetings and going to as many networking events as you can manage the more the better here lastly I'd say you want to make sure that you have at least three spec projects to show that are in line with the style of work you're hoping to get hired for now I'm not sure what you're doing right now but if your full-time job was say making corporate videos and now you're hoping to get hired as a DP on verit style docks it's going to be hard to land those first jobs you need to be able to show that you can do the work you're trying to get so if you don't already have good work samples shoot some spec projects before you quit if you start your freelance career with a solid portfolio and the kit you need to actually execute those types of projects you're going to be in a much better spot than with a resume of unrelated work okay so we're starting to run a little bit long here I think and it is getting cold and it is starting to rain a little bit harder so I'm going to do one last question and call it because I can feel my hands starting to lock up and I don't want to soak my camera this one is a great question from Jim who asks how do you know when your dock is done my director locked up the last shoot but I felt like I could have kept on going forever I think we all struggle with this but it often comes down to remembering the three FS of film making filmmakers finish films a 3/4 or even 95% completed film is essentially the same as no film at all and the most important part other than starting is to actually get the thing done and out in the world that means making a hard Choice sometimes and just calling it a day for the sake of making progress there's no rule here to follow unfortunately but if you have the scenes or beats you need to show your character changing over time and moving towards accomplishing their goal then you might have what you need to tell your story if you want to keep shooting then the question to ask is is what we're waiting for going to show some aspect of their story that we haven't already seen or is this going to change the way the audience sees their Journey or make it more powerful than what we already have if the answer is yes then it might be worth waiting the answer is no and the future material is just going to kind of stay the same thing but in a slightly different way or in a different setting then it might be time to call it quits now you want to make sure in docs that you don't repeat yourself and saying the same thing twice is a really good way to make your audience bored in a hurry so if you're just hanging around to get more of the same it could be that you're actually just stalling because continuing to film is often easier than rapping and moving on to the edit in a lot of ways now I'm not saying you're doing this right now but I've done it in the past before because as long as you're still in that shooting phase then you don't have to deal with all the hard work that's coming all right speaking of knowing when to rrap let's end this one here that was really fun for me and I hope it helped answer some of your questions because I know it can be hard to find answers out there sometimes I do wish I could answer every question that comes my way every day but with the increasing load of comments and the dozens of emails I get every week it's kind of getting impossible to give the personalized feedback I'd like to it's a bit more doable in the members group for people who signed up for the course so if you want to get your questions answered a bit faster you might want to get on the waiting list for the next intake which is January or sometime but in the meantime I hope you learned something new and maybe got a few ideas for your own film making Journey see [Music] you
