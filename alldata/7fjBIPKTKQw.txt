all right Jonathan Blow time here we go social media rots your brain have I heard of carbon my response is please stop bothering me about the Apple M1 chip I thought carbon was a language meant to repl I'm I'm confused with the M1 okay uh I asked that M1 question oh nice please stop bothering me about what is my opinion about blubber blop Linux drro so by the way that is that is truly Fair you should quit bothering people about every Linux I cannot tell you how many people are like okay but okay so you're you're you're on pap W but have you try have you have you tried and it's just like no man I you know honestly I just want to I Just Want to Have I3 just want to use t-o and I just want to use VI in peace like that's it that's all I want to do that's it I don't want anything else I literally don't want anything else guys the carbon question this is this is triggering me here not because of anything to do with carbon at all it is the following thing guys the fact that multiple people have this question is it's a product of the current Internet environment that we have built which is about propagating shallow news at very high speed and things just sort of you know go into and out of being Vogue to talk about what is the current thing this week right and the thing that you should realize is if you zoom out and see that pattern ignore or particular instances but if you zoom out and look at that pattern as a whole pattern and what comes from it almost none of those things are very important by definition and therefore you know because they only lasted a day or a week therefore if this is a major source of where you get your ideas from or what you think about things or what you're interested in you're preventing yourself from having high quality thoughts in a certain the hard part about that statement is that one of the strongest things a person can do is to see what other people do the ability to be able to recognize how someone's approaching a problem and their ability to solve it despite maybe what they're solving how they're doing it won't become popular and will eventually just fall away and become out of Vogue yeah like maybe that's not important but sometimes the idea itself is actually really really nice and you can often just take out these Concepts and apply them as you see things like you know I agree uh rxjs was something I used a lot in 2013 rxjs is something that I used a lot in 2014 rxjs is something I used a lot in 2015 rxjs is something that I actively hated by 2016 you see what happened there and by the way is there something right there is that my backpack oh it is my backpack um anyways it's going to stay in the shot it's staying in the shot but using rxjs uh you know that was the first time I've I was ever introduced to a monad and of course that actually became quite useful I was very very happy about that and I actually ended up using uh them monads and other things I used it in logging and some other other items and that actually made things very very useful so the idea of rxjs was well people were really excited about it especially in the earlier days and in the latter days it's largely fallen out of you know Vogue but the concepts of monads and stuff like that was exposed to me as a normie right as somebody who who didn't have like that kind of exposure and so it's been very beneficial and I've been very very happy about that and so is looking at everything that's invogue bad or good it's very hard for me to like agree with this take in this sense because I don't know if there is a definite answer and maybe I'm misunderstanding his argument right I could be very well misunderstanding his argument completely in arguing completely the wrong thing which wouldn't surprise me at all but how I'm taking his argument is that when you see something new you should just ignore it which by the way if you're just learning maybe that's better device maybe there's a time in place for you to do investigations or a way you can time box things to make sure that you're not uh always getting swept away with the latest thing and just wasting inordinate in ordinance amount of time just learning the current thing sense and this is very serious to me I mean a little bit of it's fine right but you know I'm here on the twitch Channel and every time there's a new says the man promoting Russ before got to 1.0 um that's stupid argument by the way uh hate to tell you this Sil hairs yeah you're getting it why is the number in the major version what what does that say you know most people run with sver sver has really nothing to do with with the Readiness of a product so why would a one in the major version make any difference if they promis not to break any apis why would you go to one one means that you have fundamentally broken something so it's like that that number doesn't mean anything it has no actual value I think he's saying Outsourcing your opinions on these things to other people is not good now this I mean sometimes it's not good but sometimes like how else do you go like you can't have an opinion on everything if I told you this that I think constantly customizing your environment is not necessarily the greatest approach to learning software and being successful at software you don't have to listen to that but the inverse is that for you to discover if this opinion is good or bad is going to require quite a few years of you always customizing your stuff constantly and then measuring the outcome of that not all is free right and I think that's one of the hard Parts about this thing people are asking me about it so like in aggregate the twitch chat brain is a brain that has a very poor information diet is another that's fair that that's completely fair I I'm I'm to I'm totally I'm totally on Jonathan blow's take right there twitch yo twitch chat brain your temperature is your your your iq's room temperature is what he's trying to say based and true yep and a w yeah absolutely way to say it and that shouldn't be that surprising but it is how it is right um this will actually keep you from being a really good programmer in the long I I do want to do one thing and I know we always make fun of twitch chat but like can we just just one quick thing I know I do try to normalize some level of like I don't think everybody's stupid I don't really like that opinion that everybody is stupid except for me like you know people say this I just saw this like yesterday someone responded that 90% of programmers are dead weight right and then you have to look at how many people like that tweet and you have to start thinking what are the odds that everyone that liked that tweet is also within that special 10% like at some point you might not realize that you're probably part of that 90% how are we all Geniuses on the bell curve and so twitch chat doesn't get the time to express themselves with words but instead with written text which is Al is is very difficult to do well especially when it's time moving and it's fast and it's topical and you you're like 6 seconds behind where we got more information and then I read your chat which is behind and like incorrect you know it's not that great by the way penis penis ligma communist intensifies communism intensifying yeah okay so twitch chat isn't like I'm not saying it's it's great long term because it's the wrong kind of thought it is not like we need people who are competent who and who can solve hard problems and building competence is not a short attention span thing and solving hard problems is not a short attention span thing so true factual I don't think those two are related though I think you can read news you can read people's opinions you can be involved actively on the internets but I I I don't I I don't think you can relate necessarily those two things we're just really not handling ourselves very well with where we place our mental attention and this could have very large consequences in the short term like even within the next year or two so so it bothers me that's all I'm saying all about the hot takes it's empty calories yeah but even like hot take implies controversial right but like people almost don't know or care anymore that there's something to do with your attention besides go on Twitter and see or go on Hacker News or Reddit and see what people are talking about right this second and the problem is done over years that's going to damage your brain not no sounds like there's probably a Time based thing there right like I think there's probably like an hour measurement involved here I mean I think he's right on the hot take the thing is is I can go on Twitter and say hot take working hard uh it uh working hard and working smart is better than working smart and people will be like people people lose their crap on Twitter when you say working hard is good and so it's like that's considered a hot take so hot take and all this kind of crap is stupid hot take really means this is going to RI this is going to ruffle the average Twitter readers you know feathers or the inverse it's going to be a hot take and it's actually not a hot take most people simply agree with it and they hit the like button cuz it says the word hot take and they want to like a hot take it's as lukewarm as it gets working hard does res result in more wins it's like crazy that you have to say that yes if you were if you had one person that works for 30 hours a week and one person that works for 80 hours a week and they're both learning the same thing one's going to be better than the other and people just like actually try to fight that well actually you know the you never know that that 30h hour person will be like you know what it doesn't really matter cuz at the end of the day you need to see a problem over and over again time in the saddle almost always dictates a good programmer versus a bad programmer it's crazy that people try to argue against that well actually you know those 30 hours could be massively productive it's like they're not mass they're not that productive I hate to break this to you that's not how it works and so like that's like one of these spicy takes it's kind of wild that that is a thing you know a th000 hours is a big help 10 th 10,000 is amazing yeah at the end of the day it's the end of the day facts I heard in Africa once every 60 seconds a full minute passes no exaggeration that's it may have already damaged your brain hopefully in a way that's recoverable but I I will say this though I will say this uh I think there are people that do actually have what I call the brain rot right and and and the Brain rot I've seen it before I just recently saw a video uh where somebody got super heated about uh HTM X and compared it to like doing something a really bad way and then react doing it the really good way right there are people that just can't see that a pro like not all problems have to be solved one way right and so like this to me is the example of actual brain rot where social media has actually hurt you like you don't even have the opportunity to realize whether you're right or wrong and this person actually when describing hdmax described wrong technically on many points like actually did not understand the thing but then made reasons why the thing he misunderstood was this way and then why react was better and you're just like okay that's not like let's back it up a little bit let's actually maybe maybe a longer stint in something will give you a good or bad opinion like my opinion on react has come from working in not one but two multi-million line code bases of react maybe the first one maybe the web website was more like 500 to 700,000 lines of code I maybe I could say the first one is closer to you know less and the first one was actually a much more pleasant experience I actually liked it significantly more the second one was much much much harder to work in and so my opinion of react is probably different than people who've only ever worked in like say 10 20 30,000 line code bases those are just simply different opinions and so the problem is is that I don't try to approach something and go this is good you should only use this like I my argument comes down to to like archetypes of the argument why would I like something like HDMX over react why would I like some like why would I like go over JavaScript well really it comes down to I like knowing where my program errors versus discovering where my program errors I just find those two things fundamentally different propositions and that's that why do I like HDMX overreact for most projects because most projects don't need intense client side state I find client side state difficult because I have to first program the thing on the on the server side and convert into a view that can be transferred across the wire then I have to hydrate that same state on the client and then Rego through creating that state and representing it as a new view on another device and that's just like I I'm going to make a bug it's going to be difficult I'm going to make a mistake having to do a bunch of these things over and over again on two different sides you know that's but that's me maybe I'm not as good of a programmer as the people that are doing all these react things and that's also potential there you go that's brain rod for me damage is the people that's like you can't you can't see the two arguments I get why client state is good there's plenty of problems that are just easier to solve with client State and I'm very very very happy about that I don't argue against that absolutely and I'm I'm speaking from experience from both this phenomenon and previous ones right so I was doing I do less Twitter than a lot of people but I was doing a fair amount of it and like it's just a way you know if you're not feeling 100% motivated and you want to just kind of CAS casually do some stuff while you work today it's very easy to go on like Twitter or whatever and read some stuff and I was noticing that my attention span was pretty short for a lot of things it wasn't short for programming still I was doing fine at programming but I think that's because I built all my programming habits um but like I didn't want to read a book right and in fact where I would claim that I wanted to read a book and then wouldn't read much for like a year and then you know like that has consequences I do think those are two different things right I think it's very easy to program because program is stimulant right like your screen it's it it's all the things that make humans kind of like we struggle dopamine effects right we really struggle with those and social media also has the same thing whereas reading a book you just don't get the same you don't get the same effect it's much harder to get that effect and so I don't think it's very hard for me to say that social media is the problem why people don't read a book like it's very hard for me to to agree with that statement because I don't know if it's actually true like I love the idea of reading reading is a little bit more difficult all right it's always a little bit more difficult and so I I do find that I really like I've been trying to read more and I've been I've been really trying to read read a lot more um I I know there's a lot of studies out there that say okay yes attention's man has been reduced by short form content I'm not sure how really good that thing is I don't know how good I don't know how good of a study that is and I'm not sure if it's actually real and what I mean by that is that I think your brain falls into optimizations patterns right and so if all you do is consume shorter things your brain is more optimized to consume shorter things I don't think it actually means that you can't have a longer form of attention I think that it just really means that you have to have maturity to know when to do the thing like I find people I I I know people that can do both short and long form that they are able to say no I'm going to do the long form thing now and they're just simply able to emotionally do the right thing even when it's difficult I I'm not convi I'm not fully convinced that the problem is attention spans as much as it is just simple like inability to regulate yourself against doing something you don't want to do like it's hard it's very very hard and and the thing is is that each one of these contents just feel better right I'm not sure if it's actually is some I don't know if this is causation or correlation is what I'm trying to say I'm not convinced that it's causation versus correlation that's it I I don't know just on on your mental development now that part I fixed um but you know I grew up before the internet so what happens to somebody who's like 10 year old 10 years old today right now I did not grow up before television and back during the television days when people watch TV which I did a lot I did a lot too there was this commonly understood thing like oh don't watch too much television it'll rot your brain right and we were kind of sarcastic about it we said oh you know whatever yep in retrospect that was totally right it did rot all of our brains and um I probably would actually be measurably smarter today if I hadn't spent so much time watching television and I probably would have been able to do more faster in life and I probably would be a lot more competent at what I do so this is one of those things where I disagree on the statement I I know there is a lot there's like brain scan studies that show that the consumption of Television increases like these lesions in your brain like it actually like can drop your IQ by a DEC like or a generation's amount uh but my general thesis is that I don't think the reason is that you're watching TV is the problem I think the reason is and I think this can happen in any form of content or anything you do is that when you it's it's about time sitting in autopilot when you watch TV versus playing a video game those are two very different experiences right when you watch TV you are just letting information hit your face and you're not even engaging in the topic much right you might feel an emotion you might get excited you might be thrilled but it's just like you're just feeling and and consuming whereas at least with you know like a video game you could argue the same amount of hours spent on a video game game you're actively thinking through and pushing into the ideas or arguing the topics or trying to find ways around stuff it's like there is a fundamental difference there and I'm not sure if it's just the act of watching TV that's bad versus the act of not like engaging that's bad can people engage in a topic and even when it comes to television and it actually causes like good things versus bad things like Candy Crush I mean Candy Crush is like such a kind of a Mindless game you know it's like it there's not like a lot to it TV is a passive consumption yeah and so that's why I I hate like I don't like saying that this has to be this way I just because I I feel very strongly about this I really don't like my kids watching TV and we really try to do TV is for family movie night but then any other form of of screen time it's us playing Elden ring or or fortnite or Roblox or me trying to get them to program python or Lua or scratch or anything like that right it's like more going into like the thought filled stuff your kids play Elden ring yeah I dodge and roll my boy Caleb swings the sword that's how I played that's that's how I made time to play Elden ring okay we played together like by the way I never beat Elden ring I'm ashamed of it it's a game that I would love to beat I never got to beat because my kid gave up at beastman clergyman or the Beast clergyman very hard Boss by the way very very hard boss you a major way not not in like a barely noticeable way like in a major way is very clear to me when I look at how I spent all my time back then that that's the case being honest about these things is important and so I don't see why you know I think the modern internet stuff is worse than television was cuz at least if you're watching a shitty you know episode of Airwolf or something I forget if that was a half hour show or an hour show but it it at least had a a consistent narrative for the length of its runtime which is not something you get from a lot of other things the funny part is we agree so much like Jonathan Blow and I agree so dang much uh on this topic but like again it still comes down to this passive I actually think the consistent narrative the thoughtfulness that would go into the show is less good than if you could read Twitter news and actively engage and think about why this problem is being solved this way and actively engage in the topic of doing it and thinking through it right I mean I mean it's generally I I'm not sure like I I just am not convinced that that's not it like I really do think that engaging in whatever you're doing is always going to be a lot better right and like that's why we're watching this video this video is US engaging and thinking and chewing on the idea of what he's trying to say and it actually is chat trying to participate here chat I am trying to read what you are saying just most of what you say isn't like super intelligent but some of it is really really good I want you to know that right now okay you put it on the screen for a moment deck deck deck balls ball deck B Boles uh Prime Thor Casey blow yeah I've had I've had three out of four on and you know Casey and I are really good friends I actually really like Casey Thor and I are good friends really like Thor uh me and Jonathan Blow have never really talked I my suspicion is that we're very very very similar uh that were probably too similar to be great friends have you ever had that experience where we're so similar but like slightly fractured that it it won't it won't it won't work which is funny cuz like me and him like I am fully agreed on this topic I just don't believe in the origin that he's saying it do I think it affected my intelligence yes I think I'm less smart than I would have been I would agree me personally I think smoking pot at 8 years old and dropping a lot of acid uh probably ruined my intelligence more than anything else um before I went to college and dropped too much acid where I had visual problems for a decade uh before that I could remember anything I heard like I had like that fullon good oldfashioned pretty much photographic memory like not fully photographic but we're talking like I'm edging I was like an edge Lord to photographic whatever the one step down was and now you know memory is not nearly as good sucks it could also be be you aging n no no definitely it definitely was too much acid that really uh that really downgraded me from that four from that 4K to 1440 probably it certainly affected my ability to exercise my intelligence um and therefore it took me a lot longer to get where I would have otherwise been right like in some sense doubt it was AED to have that effect as the person who experienced it I love when people try to tell you your life there's nothing better than When someone tells you your life it's like dude I okay so I I I've had uh uh 1020 Vision my whole life uh I've been able to see not the line in which is the good Vision Line but the one that's below the good Vision Line I was always in the one that was below it and then in a singular day I had this little my my kid came up to me crying and he had this like white stuff on his hand and there was this bottle that he was holding that we didn't know where he got it from and he was crying it was hurting him and I was like what is this stuff like this seems dangerous so I went to go open it and it exploded and it went right into this eye and it what turns out it was a it was a 27% um [ __ ] it's not hydronic acid hydrogen peroxide 27% hydrogen peroxide so not 3% but 27% it turns out consuming a small amounts of hydrogen peroxide can actually be really good for you um and so i' put on the drop in my water and have a drink of hydrogen peroxide I didn't know that happened but it exploded hit me in the eye and it hurt super bad and I washed it out and ever since then this eye sucks it just it it absolutely sucks and I literally have somebody in my life who isn't I is is an optomologist or whatever you call them I walked up to them I was like yeah dude this eye it sucked like I I I had this hydrogen peroxide and exploded in my eye and then I couldn't see and he's like oh hydrogen peroxide can't do that and I'm like yo dog so like I had 10 20 vision and then in 15 minutes I went from 1020 Vision to blurry so it's like yo dog like it went in my eye and then I couldn't see for the rest of my life and they're like oh yeah that can't do that I'm like okay so this is one of those experiences where you're telling me that I didn't have something but I the person who had it happened to them had it so acid I took a lot of acid after that the next day man it was really hard to remember stuff okay yeah that was like the next day okay I get it like my memory just wasn't there I used to be able to sit in class listen to everything never study a single day and pass the T Test 100% that's why I claim I never I never did a day of homework in in high school cuz I could just sit in there and actually just do it well it turns out after that day on the dot I lost that power I had to study starting from that day forward and for you that you know for me that was a very noticeable difference that was kind of like when my eyeball got squirted with some juices and then I could literally not see see well what age 19 so again I could feel it happen actively I don't think you're right and I think you're stupid so that's fine no dude you just got old that day you just got old that day when you turned when you're 19 you just got old instantaneously you aged 20 years that's all that happened there's not that much of a difference between being smart and knowing how to use your intelligence like you could arue for you know whatever the Baseline biological capacity is or whatever but like it it became very clear to me at some point that knowing how to use your intelligence is a thing and if you don't know how to use it you might as well not have it it's probably hard to know how much it rotted my brain no well but I can look at how I spent my time back then that's by the way whoever said that in the comment was really really correct which is the unfortunate part is you can never AB test right there is no such thing as AB test you can only do you can only say what you feel and what you feel like should have happened right he feels like he should have been smarter very well he could be right but to what extent would he have been smarter he's already clearly a very smart guy right so to what extent would he have been faster would he have been better maybe but it could have also dramatically altered the course of his life sometimes being gifted more can often lead you to not be as successful in the things you are doing there is no you know there there's no guarantees in life just because you became smarter doesn't NE necessarily mean you became better right you could actually end in a worse position versus how I spend it today and what the outcomes are twitch audience member most interactions can basically only be very superficial and very simple yeah I mean it's true but I mean let's let's take another one of my trap exit on okay so again I'm sorry for putting you on the big board but I I have to it just came by trap exit where did you go trap exit where did you go okay dang it dang it where the hell am I okay user trap exit most people with very high IQs are not successful okay so I feel like we just got done describing how maybe we shouldn't say things in which have no basis in reality like I just don't think you can say that right like I don't know how you would even begin to measure that right like I get things happen citation needed yeah I just don't think it's it's it's true so it you know just think through your thoughts like why why this is empirical people with very high IQ is generally aren't successful in normal terms unsure again I don't know I don't know if what you're saying is true now maybe in the like the top 20 people Fair they may be so smart that they have a hard time you know conforming to reality but what is very high like top 3% top 3% are probably just regular people people yeah Trump has a high IQ we were told right remember I have a very high IQ I know all the IQs I have all of them my pet peeve questions the how do I get started programming question right I hate that one as as frequent viewers to this channel know but it's still better because it's not asking about gossip it's ostensively asking about an actual skill that somebody could practice and that has an intrinsic benefit res like did you hear about carbon or what did you think about the M1 or whatever is just gossip which has a function I mean the reason human beings gossip is because gossip has a a function but like it it sounded like he wasn't sure if he could actually believe that himself it has a function maybe probably I don't know what the function would be right I I I can't like there is such a thing as way too much of that and we're we're way down the way too much fair you get the how to get started question it can be overwhelming no I don't think so I think anyone to be very honest most people asking the how to get started question are not programmers and won't be it's like it's a self-filtering question it's like if you're asking that question you're not a programmer interesting I'm gonna go with interesting on that one I think I see what he's trying to say which is there's to be a programmer there definitely requires an intense amount of like self curiosity you agree with the slight tweak hold on I twitch staff in here if you ask that question multiple times you're not a programmer okay fair yeah that's kind of like where I that where my head was going which is there's the first time you have to ask which is like I know nothing where do I even go and if someone says Ah go to Google and start googling right okay step one I I do think to be a programmer you have to have some sort of innate built-in curiosity right I think that that that's real that's fair but if you're already on Twitch watching someone program talking about stuff and you've kind of perused a few channels maybe that no longer falls into the category of of somebody that's that's that's a programmer at heart now I think someone can just simply be determined I think you can become a programmer purely out of determination right and it has nothing to do with curiosity you're like I need to make a life change I need to be able to uh go and and provide for my kids whatever it is I'm going to do it and that's it and that is its own thing zero curiosity still able to successfully do it right I think there's many different ways I'm not I'm not sold on one but I I see the partial truth to that but there's the difference between the per like when you don't know what you don't know you got to start with a question so it's good that they start with the question but once you've started to see and interact and kind of understand like what's going on but you're still asking the question say you ask the question multiple times over and over again you never just commit to anything maybe like maybe there's like a a little bit of a difference there and so I I I do understand that perspective as well he did come up from the old school he did come up from the the rtfm or GTFO side of things so I I do get that there is yes so so that's kind of like where I'm getting at this there's this whole idea of people who look for permission and people uh who look for forgiveness and I do think that it is um I do think that it is really good to not try to ask for permission right I think you really should just always try to do something yourself and just go for it and even if you're Reinventing the wheel you fully know that this wheel exists do it anyways sometimes that's like the best way to learn right it's not like it's great to build your own game engine there's way better game engines than the one you're going to build I'm not trying my best to do I'm I'm literally trying to deliver this as as the best I can cuz the problem is is that I'm not going to go out there and say if you ask that question you're clearly not a programmer okay I don't think that is good I'm trying to give you like I think that this would be technically considered the red pish answer which is that you got to go out there and you got to do it and at some point if you don't know what you don't know you got to ask a question but once you have an idea and you never get past the question asking phase then yeah you're probably not ready to be a programmer that's not me trying to to avoid getting cancelled I'm Prime pilled I don't know sure what that is okay that's another reason why it annoys me even though you deleted all your Social Media stuff four years ago when you're demotivated it's so easy to find a way to waste your day on use of stuff like lurking on Twitch even YouTube recommended videos are like 1 minute Clips um yeah I mean I understand I understand that mode right there is this mode where you're not that motivated and it's just very easy to get the very small feeling of reward of or distraction or whatever from watching these small videos and stuff for sure um but then you feel worse after that because then you spent the whole [ __ ] day doing that 30 days in a row or whatever so you know the trick there there's two things right so one trick is just to notice that pattern just see it just keep seeing it you don't even have to do anything about it at first just keep seeing it and then after enough seeing it um maybe you eventually can uh can know what to do like I do agree with that um okay hold on we'll let him finish it because I have I have a lot on this topic that I I feel very strongly about often if you just keep observing the pattern it'll naturally give you the ability to break out of it because you'll just it lets your subconscious wrestle with what's going on this I I strongly disagree with that last part um I think any change is extremely intentional and if you're not making that daily choice and that daily battle it's extremely hard to change anything about yourself I think most people um I think most people are I that's why you know just because you can do something does not make you free Freedom comes from the fact that you can take your higher will and shape your actions based on what you want like that's real Freedom or real Liberty shall we say which is the ability to to use your higher will as your guide and a lot of people what they do they don't have is that higher will ability they have that higher will pinging that's like oh we should do this but their lower will is just like so strong that they can't even like they're you're just an animal right like you don't have the ability to get out of your animal desires and actually do the higher more difficult desires like let me give you an example this morning I woke up at 5:15 unfortunately due to circumstances my mom being in town me wanting to spend time with her I didn't go to bed till 10:30 last night this sucks okay that's me lying down so that means I only lied down for like 6 hours and 45 minutes this is just for me this is I'm not Thor this is unacceptable amount of sleep for me I woke up I felt shitty okay I felt horrible I did not want to do anything today right absolutely just kind of loathed this experience right but I got up made M you know made some coffee and I went in into this room turned on the stream and started streaming you know why because I knew something very very important that was going to happen if this is unmotivated called a zero and this is motivation which we'll call this 100 that once I started doing the task this was going to extend and get more and more and more exciting and that I don't consider myself at this point right I don't try to measure if I should or should not do something when I'm at my low I go and I do the thing and break through the low and then it goes and it grows and it grows and it grows to the point where right now all I want to do is write this client to do the performance testing for our Tower Defense because I want to be able to set up everything that's needed so I can go and just like keep on crushing out code but I wasn't there this morning I absolutely did not want any of it and if I wouldn't have done what I did today guess what would have happened theoretically this line would have just Fallen even further back and this line would have become even worse because I gave into the worst part lower will higher will what I should do what I ought to do what I feel like I should do it's extremely difficult to do what you ought right right anyways try it try measuring it try getting out a book like try getting out a um a little journal and write down exactly how you feel before you start a project talk about how you don't want to do it get it all out there write in that journal 45 minutes later after you've been doing it for a while after you've gotten into the flow and you'll notice that the ways and words of how you describe stuff is very very very different right all of a sudden you're more excited about doing the thing you have more motivation and it's I mean it's identical to working out right the first five minutes of a workout are just like God awful cuz it's just like I don't want to move my body right but then once you move your body like ah yeah it's pretty good Prim isn't eat that frog practitioner so that I don't know conscious wrestle with what's going on the second thing though is to understand like okay you're feeling demotivated or kind of bad or kind of down right now so what like who cares like is that really that big of a deal and if it's not then why shouldn't you just do whatever you would normally do if you weren't feeling down that's actually a very powerful mindset to have right just whatever you're feeling is just what you're feeling right now sorry it's been bothering me it doesn't it doesn't have a lot more um depth or consequence than that and that's weird because we're in the society that's often feeling fetishist right like we have we have this entire industry that wants wants you to go talk about your feelings for $70 an hour so of course they tell you that that's how to solve your problems but uh you know it's really not the right way to solve some PE some people maybe don't like this advice I me I think so I mean some people do need it fair I you know okay I'm going to give an extremely hot take I'm going to give a really really hot take here this one might get me canceled I think a lot of people use therapy as a replacement for Community they don't have community in their lives they don't have any real strong friendships they don't have any real connection with other people so of course their life is disastrous like they have no bonds to anything and I don't know if therapy is going to help you like it might you might get something out of it but you're not really getting what you need which is people you're a social creature man's a social creature whether we like it or not we're a social creature now there are people that actually need therapy I I don't I never argue that thing you know but I think most people suffer from a lack of community real Community real friends friends how do you know you have a real friend move and go call friends and if you have nobody to help you move you don't have friends all of them is just to realize your feelings are just your feelings and um you know it's nice to have happy feelings but by definition we don't have Happy Feelings all the time and so just you know accepting that is actually very powerful in engineering you call it admir ing the problem yeah yeah that's a good way to say it that's also a good little thing he just said that I actually really do like that except the fact that the world isn't always going to be great like there's there's there's plenty of difficult things right there's plenty of difficult things there's plenty of time that's not easy plenty of times that aren't fun um sometimes they're in your control sometimes they're completely out of your control but if you're if you embrace the suck I think it just makes things easier right I think that if you don't embrace the suck at all I think it's extremely difficult to go through these it's not hard to put the phone down but it's hard to stop yourself and picking up instinctively but you could increase the amount of work required so for example you could just power your phone off so that if you pick it up you have to like wait through a boot of the phone right and then you put a SIM password do whatever you need to do to fix that you think it's pretty normal to ask and not a sign of the downfall of society okay well here's the thing here's the thing I like Dr look around for all the people saying that at any technology that is not software even software is in Decline but it's kind of invisible you can't see the inside of a program look at construction what amazing buildings were built lately compared to what was built in the past look at Transportation what transportation systems were built lately compared to what was has built in the past um look at engineering what new sources of energy technology were invented compared to what was invented in the past um Material Science all this stuff um sometimes like with Material Science you may have limited knowledge of the field but you know that's what your computer's for you can look it up um we kind of haven't been doing that much for 30 or 40 years is what you probably find with some notable outliers right so one dude is responsible for electric cars and [ __ ] rocket ships okay um El mentioned if that dude weren't there you can imagine what the progress of both of those fields would be now it is I both agree and disagree with him for different reasons right uh one one reason that I think is really is really interesting is we definitely don't have the beauty aspect we used to it's hard for me to say that's an L take or a good take right um so like the Beauty aspects like you look at like a lot of the the the old churches the old you know architectures like there's some really impressive things like done and created that I I I I honestly it just like it's it's really really blowing away right like our reason wasn't you know like you know I I I don't try to quote unquote dog on capitalism but uh you know like it was just a different some of the motivations weren't quite the same as they are today and so it wasn't simply about getting the thing done but about building building something that is beautiful and both practical and beautiful right there's there is something that's a there's something that's different shall we say that happened hundreds of years ago than it does happen today so like I agree with that side of the take I I truly do agree with that side of the take um but I mean there's also really impressive things being built like the the tallest towers ever have been built now like that is something that's really impressive it's impressive in a different sense it's not I wouldn't call it beautiful but the engineering of it that allows it to SW way when there's like when there's any form of earthquake and stuff like that I mean that is it is very impressive impressive does not equal Beauty that's very very true and so I think that that's really that's really cool for people saying it's capitalism as that's the fault I I think you guys are just fundamentally wrong I'm not quite convinced it's C capitalism that is the problem uh the the cathedrals were really really incredible right uh yeah practical yeah it's probably better to say uh uh practicality versus like Aesthetics people were very concerned you know we we've changed in what we consider like the best right and so right now the best is is good solid engineering and super super tall that doesn't really leave a lot of room for beauty European architecture versus ux AR yeah yeah like I'm deeply unfamiliar with old European architecture other than pictures I've seen and it's absolutely incredible some of the things I've seen money is sure related I don't know if money is sure related I mean incidentally yeah probably um but I mean you could just make that argument for everything right money is in incidentally related and then just name anything uh labor costs make a huge difference I'm pretty sure and how uh productive people can be yeah true one person can now build really incredible things whereas it used to just take a master to build that one thing right the the very very different very very very different experience with those two things if anybody can just simply press a button and have a factory produce a part because that one part got designed by one guy and now is being done over and over again versus the person that actually had to be hammer out swords for 50 years before he became a technical master and then that person makes you a sword like there's a very there there's a different it's a it's a different experience and a different emphasis on what we're doing right but also Rockets are really incredible so it's like very hard to compare it's very hard to compare these things they're different they're different for different reasons is very very obvious if you just look all you have to do is just look we are not building a lot of Hoover dams or Golden Gate bridges or anything like that right what happened something happened and it's I I don't know if that's technically true or not so I I actually have I I I have no idea because they're already built well there's other Bridges you could build right so saying saying that they've already been built therefore you don't need them that's not true right but what are we building other things I actually have no idea the sphere is really insane the sphere is actually super cool I saw it it's also horrifying for anyone that lives near there it's so bright Golden Gate now all we got are silver Gates and Silver Gate is literally like 12th the size of the Golden Gate I think Marvels have become oh that's a really interesting thought who just did that I think Marvels have become undan how long ago before people uh uh could fly and now we can travel the world if you have money yeah I mean it is true sometimes you know excluding recent Boeing instances airplanes are extremely impressive but we've just seen it so much we just kind of have this problem of of seeing exactly how amazing it is right and maybe we can't keep making those steps insane T tunnels taller and taller skyscrapers I mean the the skyscrapers the modern ones are really really impressive novelty wears off social media is so broad yeah yeah dude you're trying to take his expertise in a very narrow part of computing and then apply it everywhere like he [ __ ] knows the inner workings of everything instead of maybe just admitting ignorance I I don't know if that's true either um maybe maybe we're missing the point of his argument right uh like I don't know the last truly big structure that was created in the United States okay I I'm just trying to you got to just try you got to just try to understand somebody's somebody's arguments instead of getting upset and and calling the guy ignorant you know there's probably a fundamental miscommunication going on the sphere is cool the sphere might be the last I mean is is a big one but I'm not sure if that's like the same the sphere you know okay so here's an interesting kind of observation the sphere being the next big kind of like we'll just call it the next big thing being built right you know what's really interesting let's take the sphere and compare it to the Hoover Dam or the Golden Gate what is the TS or the purpose of the sphere versus the Golden Gate the Golden Gate slash the Hoover Dam is there to provide some sort of utility hooverdam obviously is huge infrastructure Powers literally like Las Vegas obviously the Golden Gate is able to bring like ties two points of California together that you don't have to do a huge thing the sphere is purely entertainment kind of interesting to think about if that's like our next biggest achievement what is the focus of society at that point is the focus of society on improving people's lives or is the the focus on social experience no I don't know kind of interesting kind of interesting you know it's an interesting observation the new Coliseum you know you know just something what is the sphere go look it up I'm not saying he's wrong or right because I can't like I don't know all the projects I mean the problem is we also did the large hatron collider that went over under like what 60 different countries like that was pretty amazing amazing that wasn't too long ago that was just within my lifetime you know I would assume that these super large Mega ma Mega projects they're kind of like a once or twice or three times in a lifetime kind of thing it's major is the Dubai wall project that really thin long wall that they can fit everybody in I can't wait you know what everybody that wants to go live in the Dubai wall please go live in the Dubai wall okay okay you go live there we'll get all of you guys all nicely put into that and you guys can have your own little Society in your little wall okay thank you no thank you Saudi Arabia we lost our ability to do certain classes of things or lost the will to do them and after enough not doing them the ability goes away anyway because these things are hard and you need to practice them in order to know how to do them also does that mean we get the chance build the wall asking for a friend cuz maybe you can change my mind on it absolutely all right build the wall Saudi Arabia dude we don't okay when was the last time the USA actually won a war by the way by the way that's like that's a that's a very interesting point we spend more than any other Nation on Earth on the military when was the last time we actually succeeded completely at a military objective like what's our track record there like coffee SSH terminal. shop that's all I'm saying so here's what I'm saying here's the thing is that has a cause and the cause is what we or part of the cause is what we as a culture accept and decide is okay and how we decide what to do right and so when I say something like I don't think it's a good idea to gossip about new programming languages that nobody knows anything about it's part of that I'm saying this is part of who we are now that is not good so actually kind of I mean the gossip part yeah I I totally disagree with that but the discussion part is I think is really good I'm not sure if he means purely just negative talk about things you don't understand I think that can be you don't even have to put the word programming languages in there if you talk about things you don't understand and you talk meanly about things you don't understand I think that it's just it's just just poor just poor take like just to say I don't know and that's it you don't like the best part is just saying you don't know it looks better than having an opinion that's later proved like technically false right don't do that um but as far as like discussing or being interested in new languages there's a lot of really cool stuff it was very cool looking at what gleam was doing like I think that that's pretty neat it's really neat like the reason why I did rust for a couple years is because I wanted to look into rust I mean Zig is very interesting to me like I'm very very curious about looking into Zig like all these things that I mentioned our inability to make progress in all these departments is not orthogonal to how we decide to spend our time every day right it's just not and you have to fix what you can fix right I'm not in charge of the federal government I wouldn't know how to be in charge of the federal government but you have to fix what you can fix and so that's where I'm coming from also by the way so I mean it's it's it's an interesting argument to make he just mentioned a bunch of things and he's kind of wrapping it up which is like you the individual are part of the problem because you don't try to build big things in your life if we had a culture of trying to build big things in our life would we also have a culture that builds big things I think that's what is are I'm trying to like I'm trying to understand his argument the last great structure built in the United States probably your mom's house got him he streams by the way that's tdv so part of what's feeding my distaste for the what do you think about this new programming language question is I know that people have that about what I'm doing and I've seen a little bit of it I try to stay away from all of that but almost 100% of the commentary is just misinformed has a completely incorrect idea by the way sorry someone said his argument is bitterness I don't think his argu I don't think his argument is bitterness I just don't I don't see it as B I just I just don't see this argument as bitterness um I don't think it's betterness I think he is making a good observation which is people having opinions about things that they have no experience with versus which is slightly convoluted and and maybe miscommunicated which is uh learning about new and flashy things of what I'm doing and why certainly to the extent it's informed it tends to be very old and out of date like informed by those ear early videos which are very very different compared to what the language is today um and agenda driven and but it's not a mistake that this information is inaccurate because people the the utility for most people is not in whether the information is true or false the utility is in whether they can use the information as scoring for their team their political team which for programmers is often a programming language or programming Paradigm thing um and or just to boost their ego and so almost all the information when people are gossiping about what I do is complete trash so therefore there's no reason to expect all the gossip about anything else not to be complete trash as well that's what I'm saying is like you're engaging in swimming in trash now there is such a thing as high quality discussion about that sort of thing but that would require you to go program in this language for a year or two and me to go program in this language for a year or two and then we come back and have a conversation I do like that I like that a lot I mean this is why I did this is precisely the reason why I said I was going to do a pro I was going to do a year of programming ago because everyone always has these super strong opinions of go oh if air equals na stupid language uh maybe oh the type Sy is really weak stupid language maybe I you know honestly I haven't I haven't done enough of it to really truly know that that is real okay sorry I'm going I'm going to have to do this I like you I just want you to know I'm not trying to be a jerk to you okay uh but I just got done seeing that uh old phrase I don't know who said it and I just actually scroll too much which is strong opinions weakly held uh that's like the definition of non-strong opinions okay you should have strong opinions strongly held okay you should be able to argue and have a strong argument about it and you should really believe what you believe you should have opinions that are changed based on facts and experience you should not have opinions that are weakly held because that means they can be easily changed at any moment just because someone who is more eloquent than you says something okay it is okay to have strong opinions that are strongly held it's just that you should be able to change your opinion based upon evidence boom goes the dynamite I know you probably didn't mean it that way but I'm just letting you know based opinions basely held there you go most people have weak opinions strongly held that's the problem it's also okay not to have opinions absolutely that's why I'm doing one year of go good idea I to gossip about new by the way I had to jump in here because I didn't know where I was there we go progress in all these departments is not orthogonal to how we part of what's feeding my distaste for the what do you think about this new completely incorrect idea of what I'm doing and why certainly to the extent it's informed it tends to be very old and out ofd like informed by those early videos which are very very different compared to what the language is today um and agenda driven and but it's not a mistake that this information is inaccurate because people the the utility for most people is not in whether the information is true or false the utility is in whether they can use the information hold on scoring for their team their political team which complete trash so therefore there's no reason to expect all the gossip about anything else not to be complete trash as well trash that's what I'm saying is like you're engaging in swimming in trash now there is such a thing as high quality discussion about that sort of thing but that would require you to go programm in this language for a year or two and me to go programm in this language for a year or two this is where I say the go thing been doing go for like a year there you go flip so you're going to have to kind of figure that one out flip sorry sorry Flip Flip mention flip zoom in flip zoom out flip get these muscles and then we come back and have a conversation otherwise it's pointless right isn't that how a lot of information in news actually are you mean the swimming in trash yes that's part of my point like even mainstream news is this thing that I'm talking about now very lovely play till the end because we love we love you there we go all right um yeah I actually I do I do I do largely agree with everything that uh I mean I largely agree but in like completely different reasons and for different reasons why uh during this video it's like I agree 70% gree 60% uh majority uh at least and it depends on what it is right it depends on which part we're talking about I think the big thing I really liked at the end which was and like I said I see this with go all the time people are like if air equals nil that's stupid I would never want to use this this is why I use typescript and it's just like if you think you don't if you think if err equals nil is the worst part about go it is a clear and obvious thing that you have never used go beyond maybe some simple little project there are plenty worse things you could site as the reasons why you don't like go that is like the dead giveaway that is the truest there's many things worse right like that is the truest like kind of veil when you know that you're talking to somebody that has just no clue okay that's that uh new maps by default now there you go now that's a much better reason right there no maps by default 110% like that just gets you and it's super duper annoying absolutely there's all those some of those rules around channels that are just really annoying the fact that I have to have a context being passed down to go with my channels all the time seems super duper annoying and I don't like it that's that um but I also really like I really I really like go I I have really liked my experience I'm at like um what two months now of using go I plan on continuing to use my I'm I'm planning on continuing my one year of go all the way through will I be upset maybe runes I don't mind runes at all uh runes I mean you're going to get the exact same thing in many different languages right or I mean Russ is going to give you a very similar experience which is if you try to iterate through a string you're going you can iterate by character right there runes are just you is just go trying to tell you strings aren't just UT or u8s they're more than u8s they're contextual uat sometimes they're like u6s runes are not bad lack of asserts struck me the most yes I have my own kind of assert structure I think asserts would be really really good you need them for Unicode exactly go routines and channels are amazing yeah I I agree go routines and channels are amazing channels are also kind of stupid in some places I think this is where like the fundamental problems with go kind of show up is that they didn't really have a good story around they didn't have an option type if they would have just supported an option type I think they could have made their channels much more amazing and you know a couple interface changes in channels could have been incredible but you know any um so I I I I really like what he had to say here and I think a lot of it could definitely be thought more about and definitely things that I need to think more about myself so hey hey hey the name the name you know who the name is the blowen what bro what are you talking about man you know the johnen May might have sounded a little bit better the blowen just really didn't uh you know that didn't really just come out it didn't come it it didn't come off the tongue the way I wanted it to okay I don't know what happened there
