we have gotten very used to seeing that little I in front of Intel CPU numbers since the first i7 came out all the way back in 2008 but now it's the end of an era as Intel is changing its CPU branding instead of the lowercase eye and a number team blue CPU lineup will be split into core and core Ultra segments with the core CPUs being designated as either core 3 5 or 7 while core Ultra CPUs will be branded as core Ultra 5 7 or n but why did Intel decide to make such a big change when many of us have gotten quite used to what Core I5 or whatever means about a processor's performance we sat down with Intel and got some answers and we'd like to thank both Intel and Thomas Hanford for their assistance first of all even though many of us in the tech Enthusiast space find Intel's core I something branding followed by 14th gen or whatever to be pretty straight forward it turns out that many other people don't Intel got feedback from both everyday users and oems who build computers with Intel CPUs that they then have to turn around and sell that the old branding was actually rather confusing if we're talking about the lowercase ey specifically it appeared that lots of consumers simply didn't know what the heck it's supposed to stand for so Intel thought a good starting point would be just to remove this extraneous letter I mean it's not like they're Apple but if the goal is Simplicity why are they splitting the lineup into core and core Ultra we'll tell you more right after we thank paperlike for sponsoring this video If you're looking for a screen protector for your iPad paperlike has got you covered the paperlike 2.1 is manufactured in Switzerland and is designed to help you write and draw on your iPad just like how you would on paper it uses their exclusive micro bead technology called Nano dots to emulate the stroke resistance of paper without sacrificing screen Clarity make sure to check out paper like at the link below the core core Ultra scheme is part of Intel's plan to deemphasize what generation or gen a chip is a part of as they think that future chip architectures will be a little more purpose-built than they have been in the past you'd see a new broad lineup of CPUs whenever a new architecture was ready to be released there would be new chips from the cellon all the way up to the core I9 the specific chip that you buy would depend on what exactly you were going to use it for but each chip generation would be the same architecture however Intel thinks that in the future certain architectures will work better for some use cases than others so instead of putting an emphasis on what generation a processor is the core versus core Ultra distinction will be the one that gives the consumer the largest amount of information about what a chip will be good for and Intel's own market research showed that the generation language was also confusing using to many consumers which kind of makes sense 14th gen means something to folks who closely follow developments in PC Hardware like say a TechLink viewer but not much to the average person who walks into a Best Buy and just wants to know if a certain laptop is good for gaming core Ultra is supposed to mean good for gamers and content creators while just playing core is supposed to mean good for productivity and general use meanwhile Intel has also ditched the Pentium and Celeron brands and is now simply calling their entry-level offerings Intel processors again the intent is to simplify things considering later model desktop pentiums and cerons weren't super different from each other but it remains to be seen if this move will instead create a who's Ono situation so did you get an Intel processor yes wait well no huh who's on first there will also be shortened model numbers that that follow the main core or core Ultra designation Intel is moving to using just three numbers with the first telling you the generation the second telling you the relative performance level and the third digit appearing to indicate features like a higher clock or more pcie Lanes though Intel hasn't made this super clear yet is this actually less confusing maybe maybe not but it's understandable that Intel would consider names like I 94900 KF to be a little unwieldy and general feedback from OEM so far seems to be positive compared to the old naming system what might be a bit more confusing though is exactly what the numbers 3 5 7 and 9 will mean but this was already becoming an issue with the old naming scheme for quite a while Intel's desktop chips followed this pattern but as larger core counts became more common it was no longer possible to tell how many cores a CPU had just by looking at I5 or I 7 for example it's likely that these numbers will indicate a relative performance tier within the core or core Ultra Brands instead of a specific number of cores especially as typical core counts will likely continue to change in the future plus there'll be flying cars and you know it's it's complicated although there are a handful of mobile chips already out with the new branding we'll have to wait until at least the second half of 2024 to see it start appearing on the desktop side when that happens we're planning to do a follow-up video with more specific details about the naming scheme but for now weigh in down in the comments as to whether you think Intel is simplifying things or just making them more complicated but you know what's not complicated how much I appreciate you and the fact you watch this whole video thanks for
