Sam bman freed is facing 115 years in prison for fraud and I flew to New York City to watch it all happen live we'll be breaking it all down here in the $40 million Bahama Penthouse what happened with FTX who the big players are and everything about this trial start to finish but first let me be honest this is not a quick story I'm going to simplify but try not to oversimplify which is difficult given that there are a thousand pages of transcripts and government evidence so to tackle this here's what I'm going to do I'm going to give you the prosecution and defense's arguments in order as the jury would hear them two competing Visions for what happened with FTX then we'll give you the witness testimony that ultimately will decide the fate of one of the largest frauds we've ever seen and you at home can decide what you believe is Sam innocent or guilty let's get started all right this is pretty boring they just selected the jury all right this is where things get more interesting uh we got got opening statements today the prosecution's arguments is basically that s bman freed created an elaborate fraud using two companies FTX where customers could go deposit their money and Alam research which then stole that money from FTX now on the surface Alam was a trading firm and a market maker both FTX and Alam were controlled by Sam but it kind of looked like they were separate entities like they're both successful but separate now that wasn't true the companies weren't separate and Alam research got special privileges which they used to steal the customer money by the time anyone found out it was already too late according to the prosecutions lawyers a year ago the truth started to come out customers tried to get their money back but that money the customer's money was gone the defendant had taken it now on the other side you have the defense who says yeah FTX collapsed but Sam didn't intend to defraud anyone quote Sam believed that loans that FTX made to Alama were permitted and backed by reasonable security but if that's true why did things fail well think of FTX like a plane Sam and his colleagues were building the plane as they were flying it I mean it's so easy to blame people in hindsight but is it that simple quote to listen to the government's openings there were no employees it was Sam doing everything by himself that wasn't true no one person no CEO certainly not Sam could be everywhere and as a result some things got overlooked and the defense is Right 8 billion things did indeed go overlooked but their point is this if blame is to go anywhere look at it was actually the CEO of alam research at the time it wasn't Sam it was his ex-girlfriend Caroline Ellison and speaking of Caroline she's going to be testifying later against Sam in this trial so the defense is eager to discredit her and the other FTX Executives who are also testifying against Sam the defense says that all these people entered cooperation agreements which incentivizes them to testify against against Sam and make him sound as bad as possible to get their sentence lessened or as they would put it quote are they spinning things that Sam said that were good faith business decisions and now claiming they were Sinister and they knew it all along that's the story of the prosecution and the defense elaborate fraud or well-meaning failure uh before you make up your mind though know that neither of these two have really presented much evidence so to believe either of their stories that's really what we're waiting for and of course that's going to come through Witnesses speaking of witnesses this is where things get pretty lopsided to be honest the prosecution has all the witnesses they have pages of witnesses while the defense basically has none except for Sam himself who probably shouldn't take the stand so everyone you'll be hearing from today is testifying against Sam and with that in mind let's kick off with our first witness it's a customer of FTX Mark Anthony juliard now the first thing we find out is that Mark had $100,000 on FTX right before everything collapsed and he saw Sam bankman free tweet this FTX is fine assets are fine FTX has enough to cover all client Holdings we don't invest client assets even in treasuries and Mark seeing this and trusting Sam didn't withdraw his money in early November only to realize later he couldn't withdraw it and FTX declared bankruptcy the point is Mark was hurt because s b mfried lied about FTX being fine or so the prosecution says now the defensive turn came to cross-examine him and they said hey you knew crypto was new and also a risky asset didn't you yes you could make a lot you could also lose a lot yes the defense asked Mark if he had read the terms of service Mark said he did not which I get what they're doing here just kind of making him seem Reckless but I found it personally besides the point which is that SPF lied about the health of his company I found it unconvincing ing but you guys know I'm a little biased here now up next the prosecution calls their next witness Adam yida who is a long-term friend of s b m freed not only that Adam worked at FTX and he was asked to explain why he abruptly quit one day he says quote I learned that Alam research had used customer deposits to pay back its loans to creditors which might sound bad uh but it's about to get a lot [Music] worse all right Adam yida is still up and he explains that early on FTX had trouble opening its own bank account so to get customer money in quote the deposits were received in a different bank account labeled the north Dimension bank account who controlled it Alam according to Adam Adam claims that if he knew Alam was spending the money it would have raised concerns for him why well then the money wouldn't be there for the customer if the customer wanted it and here's where we learned about an account called the Fiat at FTX .c account this was the internal account where FTX tracked how much Alam owed them for their customer deposits why is this important well Adam found out by looking at it one day that Alam owed FTX $8 billion in 2022 which concerned him quote I had a conversation with Sam what was your reaction to this $8 billion liability that led to your conversation with Sam it concerned me why did it concern you it seemed like a lot of money for Alam to be owing FTX and I wanted to be certain that Alam could repay that debt spoiler alert it couldn't now Sam allegedly responded at the time we were bulletproof last year being 2021 but we're not bulletproof this year in cross-examination the defense tried to ask Adam about Sam's car which if that feels unrelated to this point it is they say quote do you know what car he did Drive no did you recall seeing a Toyota Corolla in terms of clothes he didn't buy fancy clothes right I didn't see him wear fancy clothes to be honest I felt this was a big Miss for the defense to tackle the actual issue the prosecution is claiming Sam knew how bad things were and chose to lie about it uh so that kind of went unanswered and speaking of the prosecution Matt hang is up next Now Matt works for Paradigm as we would learn which invested almost $300 million in FTX but before they did that they were worried about Alam getting special treatment on FTX to which Matt emailed them worrying about value leakage through Alam Matt claims quote I recall that we were told there was no preferential treatment for Alam this we would soon find out was a lie when the next witness Gary Wang took the stand after another disappointing cross-examination by the defense now who's Gary Wang he's really important he's the co-founder of both FTX and Alam research he's super important because he was present for all the big moments and he claims basically the opposite of Sam Sam said there was no preferential treatment of alam Gary says we gave special privileges to Alam research on FTX which allowed it to withdraw unlimited amounts of funds from the platform and we lied about this to the public now remember the jury just heard from our last witness that there was no special privileges and then the co-founder like yeah we did and we lied we lied about it uh this entire section was pretty horrible for the defense Gary's asked question did you commit Financial crimes while working at FTX yes did you commit these Crimes by yourself or with other people with other people who are the main other people uh Sam MRE thead Singh and Caroline Ellison now all those other people took cooperation agreements against Sam it's like they're all just it's like all the people who are at this company are all pointing their finger at this one guy but we're not even done yet [Music] today the prosecution shows Gary Wang's code which he wrote for FTX which gave Alam research special privileges in it there's this special function they created called allow negative which was switched on for Alam research and basically no one else in the code they show that if an account had that they were allowed to have negative balances without anything happening now this meant two things one if Alam research made a bad trade nothing happened and two it allowed Alam to basically have infinite withdrawals from FTX again from the transcript question so did this special Advantage allow Alam to make unlimited withdrawals off the FTX exchange yes if alam's account balance was zero or negative and it used the special advantage to withdraw Bitcoin whose Bitcoin would it be withdrawing answer from customers it would be withdrawing customers Bitcoin now that says it all and the point of this testimony is not just a highlight that Alam could and did steal money from customers it was also showing that Sam was kind of willing to lie about that fact because the prosecution then shows a tweet from 2019 when Sam is asked once again about conflicts of interest running FTX and a trading firm Alam which runs their trades on FTX Sam's response was that alam's account is just like everyone else and the beating didn't stop there the prosecution uh then hammered Sam on this like insurance fund thing they had if you don't know what that is basically in the event that FTX took losses they claimed that there was this Insurance Fund which they bragged in a tweet was worth over a100 million Gary Wang then explained that the purpose of this fund was this quote if an account does not get liquidated in time that other customers of FTX won't be affected makes sense an $100 million Insurance Fund does sound comforting if it were true turn turns out FTX lied question was the number on this tweet accurate answer no why not for one there's no ftt in the Insurance Fund and two the number does not match what do you mean it does not match the number in the databases was a different number question is it a real number answer no so it's a fake number yes was the real number higher or lower than the fake number lower so they just fake the D to look better but if you're wondering how the prosecution pulls up the code and they ask Gary hey it looks like it takes the daily volume multiplies it by a random number and divides by a billion answer yes does that number have anything to do with the actual number of the inurance fund no this was the exact moment guys I knew I had to go visit this trial in person I knew things were bad with FTX I didn't know they were make things up with random numbers levels of bad for our Insurance Fund so um based on this I took the next flight out to New York City from the Bahamas and uh I can't believe what I saw now I'm going to warn you guys right now they they didn't allow us to film in here so all I got was really just like a little bit of b-roll but in terms of experiencing it I Really Got A Feeling for what it was like in the actual courtroom seeing Caroline seeing Sam seeing Gary which brings us to so Gary Wang is still on the stand uh in cross-examination at this point I'm in the courtroom with my little notebook and I followed the trial around enough to know that the the defense really needs to land some Jabs here right they've been taking a beating so far so you know I I I take my seat uh and I get ready for fireworks right this is their moment and to their credit the defense brings up something called nav net asset value this is their Silver Bullet question are you familiar with the term net asset value yes that's sometimes called nav yes yes it just means that your assets minus your liabilities right roughly speaking yes if you have a positive nav you have more assets than you have liabilities right yes the defense then goes on to get Gary to admit that technically in 2022 he calculated that alam's net asset value was positive Gary says yes and they push again isn't it true that alam's net asset value remained positive all the way up to November of 2022 which is when things collapsed answer it depends a lot on how much value you ass assigned to alam's Investments which is kind of true but is it's also like a lot of a Dodge even from my very biased perspective you know I was writing in here I was just like I don't know the actual answer from Gary should have been here yes that's true alam's balance sheets showed a positive net asset value as late as November but the Nuance of why is what really matters here to understand it we're going to have to explain liquid vers illiquid assets so to do that I've flown out everyone's favorite bartender Maxwell to talk about it uh you know what what are you doing where's the bar what bar we're doing the thing right Margo robot in a bubble bath Mark Margo robot in what are you talking about you know the big short famous scene great movie I know what the big short is we're not doing the big short I think he's still taking the Michael Lewis thing pretty seriously I can't watch this just explain the thing I I boss all right so basically Sam bankman freed had found a way to borrow billions from his customers and billions from crypto lenders but didn't have the money to pay everyone back so he decides to Bluff by loading alam's balance sheet with the liquid assets the catch was these looked valuable on paper but were actually unsellable and and super risky Venture Capital Sam's crypto coins inner party loans when you hear them talk about these liquid assets think sh meanwhile what Sam owed was all liquid things with immediate value and that's how FTX could go bankrupt even when their net asset value was positive their assets were and the debts were legit it's that simple got it good now all right I hope that helped I certainly will never forget what I just saw but now Caroline Ellison is going to take the stand and talk a great deal about these a liquid assets Caroline Ellison of course being the girlfriend of Sam ex-girlfriend but more importantly she was the CEO of alam research when it and FTX collapsed immediately she admits she is guilty of fraud money laundering and then she says that she committed these crimes with Sam bankman freed the reason she frauded people is she quote incorrectly stated the amount of our assets and our liabilities and made alam's balance sheets look less risky than it really was and this is where liquid versus illiquid assets is going to start to matter because Caroline was in charge of creating and sending these balance sheets to lenders to get more loans and Sam asks her to start putting their own cryptocoins they had as part of their balance sheets things like ftt now Caroline says she did not initially do it because it was quote somewhat misleading because you couldn't actually sell these coins for what they were worth on paper and this didn't just apply to FTX his own coin ftt it applied to a whole host of coins they called Sam coins Sam coins of course being a nickname for coins that Sam played a large role in or created himself things like serum Maps oxy salana and the prosecution asks and where Sam coins ultimately put on alam's balance sheet she said yeah even though I guess initially they didn't so they have all these coins that they can't really sell but that look good on paper right that's really important the rough value of Sam coins on paper was in the ballpark of $1 billion okay now while she's preparing these misleading balance sheets Caroline also claims she learned that Alam research had loaned billions of dollars to Sam Gary NAD and other entities through FTX according to internal spreadsheets around $5 billion was loaned out why a lot of it was being used on investments she said a lot of early stage startup companies and of course political donations if you're from America take a big drink this one hurts because Sam said that spending money on politics was very effective that you could get very high returns in terms of influence by spending relatively small small amounts of money I just want to pause on that moment and just say it's such a sad indictment of our government I mean if you're going to get bought out as a politician can you at least charge a lot of money you couldn't buy my influence for less than $10 million I mean have some self-respect guys that's all I'm going to say okay we we need a better standard but anyways moving on Caroline then explains that these loans to Executives were a liquid meaning you couldn't really sell your stake if you needed to repay the loans because either iCal donations or Venture Capital you're just not going to really get your money back uh over time Caroline says that she didn't feel good about including these loans on alam's balance sheet because quote that might raise concerns for alam's lenders and quote they made Alam significantly riskier Caroline was then asked about Sam bankman Freed's approach to risk-taking quote he described himself as risk neutral meaning that most people are risk averse but he said that he was totally comfortable taking a risk as long as he thought it was a positive EV EV meaning expected value Caroline was asked if Sam gave an example of this and he did he would be happy to flip a coin and if it came up tals the world was destroyed as long as if it came up heads the world would be more than like twice as good okay the prosecution I think did not stay on this point enough this is insane of course it's not risk neutral it's degenerate Gambler Behavior this sounds like my uncle betting it all on dble zero in Vegas telling me he has a system I mean there's nothing risk nutral about being willing to bet the world's destruction on a coin toss in fact it was so bad the prosecution then asked for a break and when they came back the government then shows this exhibit which is an internal note the part in Gray was written by Sam and it's just basically a potential bad scenario for FTX and Alam why was Sam think about this well he claimed that he thought there was a 10% risk chance that this happened and he wanted Caroline to look at it some of these worst case scenario events were like their venture capital is basically worthless serum salana FDT all go down 75% you get the idea and the reason for this at the time was not purely theoretical CM said he was thinking of making $3 billion more in Venture Investments and wanted to know how that would affect alam's finances uh Caroline came back and basically told him it will affect them badly quote making 3 billion more Venture Investments would put Alam in a significantly riskier position and make it much less likely or almost impossible that we would be able to pay off our loans um that's of course bad and this is an extremely important moment because it's like someone clearly warning Sam that he should stop uh so he does that right no he then tweeted this on January 14th we're launching a $2 billion Venture fund this is right after he's told you do this you may collapse your own company because it's too risky anyway that's the end of day five day six October 11th Caroline Ellison gets back on the stand the jury is told about May of 2022 we're walking through the events the crypto Market has just crashed because of Tera Luna and crypto lenders are scared Celsius is collapsing we covered that other lenders don't want to be overextended and a lot of them decide to call back their loans the head of lending and is for example a large lender to FTX and Alam recalls $400 million of their loans now this is bad for Alam cuz they don't have money and they borrowed billions from their customers billions from lenders the only way they're going to pay back one of those people is to borrow more from the other so in this case they're going to take more from customers Caroline then testifies this quote we didn't have the liquid assets to pay all the money back and we would be taking money from FTX question and whose funds would that be that would would be coming from customer funds nevertheless they pay back those loans anyways 5 days later head of lending a Genesis texts them again he's worried might call in more loans he asks them for a quote more updated view of equity and balance sheet this is really important because Caroline says you know okay yeah I'll put it together but behind the scenes she's really concerned because she puts together a regular balance sheet but when she shows it to Sam she says quote think it looks bad I don't think we can send this to Genesis do you agree and he said yeah that sounds right now we're going to go through some of these balance sheets I know it's going to be complicated at first but there's only a few numbers you need to know about here's what the original one looked like what matters here is that their liabilities are massive numbers here are in millions so 14 billion is the total they owed and 9 billion of it are FTX exchange borrows meaning taken from FTX customers now their assets are 21 billion which is technically more but mostly consists of Sam coins some of which are literally locked up and then also they have all these related party loans which they're counting as assets $4.5 billion we've talked about that they can't get that money back so that is why both Sam and Caroline knew this balance sheet looked terrible they know they don't have the actual cash or crypto to cover their debts according to Caroline Sam then suggested that I should prepare some alternative ways of presenting the information and send them to him Caroline then creates seven alternate balance sheets and sends them all to Sam because quote I didn't really want to be dishonest but I also didn't want them to know the truth them meaning Genesis and of the seven alternate balance sheets this is the one Sam picked in a side by side you can notice a few things firstly the related party loans is gone so is the word exchange borrows Caroline claims quote I deleted the related party loans and I also subtracted the same amount of money from FTX borrows so that our nav would remain the same but our total assets and total liabilities would would both get lower which to be clear is accounting fraud but the reason they did this is what's actually important which is quote the intended effect this is Caroline was to make Alam look less risky than it was and to hide the fact that we were borrowing around $1 billion from FTX customers and so what was the result of all that lying well she sends it off to Genesis and it backfires because they keep recalling in loans all that effort and they're still asked to repay $500 million in $250 million Clips to be clear this is the worst case scenario Sam had dreamed of coming true by September ftxs borrows will have gone up to 13.7 billion if you remember just a bit ago 3 months ago it was 9.9 billion so things are spiraling out of control and by November things hit a Breaking Point when that fake balance sheet which they sent Genesis got leaked to coindesk a publication and people started to read it and realized that FTX just didn't have the money and they started withdrawing from FTX it's worth commenting here on the irony that this fake balance sheet which was supposed to conceal how bad things were was ultimately their downfall because even with all the changes they made it still looked so bad to scare customers you know but ultimately the result was people just started withdrawing all their money and they couldn't you know fulfill that and they collapsed I know a lot of people will point point to CZ tweeting about FTX as like the Catalyst for FTX collapsing but actually that was just extra fuel to the fire the truth was FTX and Alam just didn't have the money they hadn't had the money for a long period of time and that information got leaked through this like balance sheet but ultimately that wasn't the most impactful moment of Caroline's testimony cuz all these numbers you know it's hard to know how much the jury is really resonating with it but what I know they resonated with is what happened right after which is when the government pulled up a grainy text between Sam and Caroline she's saying that she's in the best mood I've been in all year Sam replies why because she exciting quote I think I just had an increasing dread of this day it was waiting on me for a long time and now that it's actually happening it just feels great to get it over with one way or another now what happened next will not be shown in court records because transcripts don't show emotions but I wrote it down cuz I was there in the courtroom at the time Caroline starts balling at this point she starts expressing remorse admitting to lying crying over her guilt and Dread and look I'm not going to read you her whole statement there but I was watching the jury and I know for a fact they were moved by this you know they might not have understood all the numbers they might not have understood the embezzlement but they understand when a CEO starts crying about how guilty they were about what they were doing what they knew they were doing the whole time and I think that was a really powerful moment and that's basically the end of the day the next day Caroline Ellison is up for cross examination this is really the defense's chance to kind of land some shots and of course it doesn't happen they tried to focus in on the fact that Caroline is just trying to get a cooperation agreement like with the government the implication being that the only reason she admitted that you know she defrauded people the only reason she's crying is because she wants to get a deal um but the problem with this was that then in redirect this gets used against the defense when the prosecution uses that to release a tape showing Ellison admitting all of this prior in an all hands meeting starting last year um alanita was kind of borrowing a bunch of money via open term loans and use that to make various illiquid Investments um so like a bunch of sdx and sdx US Equity a bunch of like other Ventures Investments Etc most of Al loans got called in order to like meet those lowary calls um we ended up like Bing bunch of funds on FDX which led to FDX having a shortfall in user funds just in general this looked bad and and I I just want to say I'm not trying to make the defense look bad I understand that I have a bias but if you're thinking to yourself wow this video Paints the defense as being bad that's true but it's not because I'm trying to select things to make it them look bad it just was like that and there's no other way to really say that and that's basically the end of the day all right up next the prosecution has Zack Prince on the stand CEO of blockfi basically the point of this was to share the fact that you know FTX or Alam were sending these fake balance sheets around blockfi would ultimately go bankrupt because they gave a bunch of loans to Alam um but I think what's worth highlighting here is how convoluted some of these loans were because it's worth understanding the only problem is I barely understand it so in order to explain it I just actually had someone else do it Karly Riley has been covering the trial as well through her Channel overpriced jpegs and she's here to explain sort of how convoluted things were let me see if I can get this in one shot okay FTX us gives a $400 million line of credit to blockfi who then starts lending $800 million to Alam who in exchange for that $800 million posts collateral back to blockfi who hold it in an account that they have on FTX who lends basically all customer deposits including block flies collateral deposits to Alam who then uses that money they borrowed from FTX to partially pay back lenders including blockfi who they paid back $150 million to in November of 2022 as everything was imploding but they never finished paying them back because they went bankrupt all right big thanks to Carly for that to be honest even still afterwards I I don't fully understand exactly how the blockfi thing worked but um usually when things are unnecessarily complicated it's because someone's trying to hide a ball somewhere so just understand that the reason a lot of these loans were structured in such a convoluted way was ultimately so that Alam or FTX could benefit and that's ultimately what happened they ended up basically siphoning money out of [Music] blockfi all right today we have another big witness nishad Singh he's basically the head of engineering at FTX but the reason he's important is because he describes finding out that Alam had basically taken customer money and confronting Sam about it on this balcony pictured here nashad says that he was pacing Behind These baskets on the left and Sam was reclined on one of the white like Chase chairs behind that in fact it's not too far from where we are now basically nishad confronts Sam saying hey Caroline's really freaked out about the net asset value situation and so am I according to nashad Sam then replied I'm not sure what there is to worry about net asset value is fantastic by almost any measure nashad replied what about what Caroline said today and Gary said today that there's 13 billion borrowed and we can't pay it all Sam said right that we are a little short on deliverables he then says this has been taxing me some 5 to 10% of my productivity for this year now this um is important because Sam and his defenses excuse traditionally has been hey I just found out about this debt this giant debt that Alam had in late 2022 I mean look I wasn't running Alam I didn't know exactly what was going on I didn't know the size of their position um uh a lot of these are things I've learned over the last month that I learned as I was sort of frantically digging into this on you know November 6th November 7th November 8th but that excuse now Falls flat because clearly we have him saying that he knew about this for over a year year after all he claims it occupied 10% of his productivity so that blows a large hole in the defense's case that Sam was some innocent bystander now today had a bunch of other fun bits in it too like spreadsheets of political donations spreadsheets of venture capital Investments spreadsheets of celebrity endorsements yes I like the spreadsheets uh there's fun data in there like the fact that celebrity endorsements cost $1.13 billion um in general just the feeling was that hey alam's burning cash even as their company is drowning in debt and nobody seems to care all right now we're on to the Cross examination of nishad and for the first time this is where the defense starts to get their feet a little bit and things flipped pretty quick the consensus the day before was that all of that was terrible for Sam NAD was a star witness he was there confronting Sam on the balcony he has this detailed story about you know how he did it but when pressed for details this is where things got really weak the defense brought up his lack of certainty earlier in his conversations quote you told the prosecutors that you had a surprising amount of haziness when trying to recall events in June and July of 2022 NAD responds I don't remember saying those exact words there was a lot I didn't remember the details around from that time wait which is it his testimony is based around him remembering exactly what he said to Sam B mfried now he's saying he's hazy on the details but it gets worse nashad said that when he found out Alam had stolen money he felt really betrayed and described it as evil but then the defense pointed out that nishad himself had borrowed money 3.7 million to buy a house for himself and where did he get that money well he also took it from FTX it turns out which just destroys his credibility because how can you think something's e evil and then use it to get a big house for 3.7 million so nashad may have been the best Storyteller for the prosecution but he was also the easiest to pick apart for the defense all right day 11 we get Peter Easton an accounting professor at Notre Dame his job is to trace what happened to the money at FTX he begins by showing a chart of the money Alam owed FTX 11.3 billion was the peak of their debts so in theory Alam should have had that money they owed as a balance in the bank but instead the green line shows alam's actual balance in Fiat they owed billions of dollars that they didn't have next Peter Easton showed how this happened through co-mingling of funds these are the different bank accounts that Alam FTX their different entities owned theoretically these all should be separate which is why they're in their own boxes but in reality the transactions looked like this they were all sending money to each other this is why Alam didn't have the money they spent it through these different shell companies Peter Easton broke down exactly how in four categories investments in businesses political contributions Charities and purchase of properties then he showed exactly what this looked like with charts like this showing from left to right how customers funds were sent to alamy to research and then spent on some investment Sam himself wanted they even had chat LW of Sam directing these Investments Peter showed multiple examples like this Alam stealing customers money we saw it over and over and over and over the effect of all this was the feeling that almost all of spf's donations Venture Capital charity politic contributions it was all paid for by his customers which led us finally to this a pie chart showing what Alam owed customers along with a breakout of what they actually spent it on on and lo and behold only a small fraction 2.3 billion was held aside for actual customers everything else was spent on things like this and seeing this chart was devastating for Sam because it simplified an incredibly complicated topic it's a basically one easily readable chart now we're going to come back to Peter Easton because he's really interesting but first I need to talk about what happened the next day so up on the stand we have K sun on day 12th FTX is General Council he's being asked about what happened during the collapse of FTX when they're looking to raise money to save the company now at some point they turned to a company called Apollo which only is important because Apollo finds out FTX is $7 billion short on customer funds and they ask Sam for a legal justification as to why the funds were missing at Alama and he asked me K son to come up with a legal justification the prosecution then asks and did you come to any conclusions answer yes that there were no legal justifications for the money being taken away Kon eventually admits though quote I did tell him that there were theoretical arguments but none of them was supported by the facts and one of those theoretical arguments became the famous margin lending defense basically in fx's terms of service there were two types of customers regular customers and margin trading customers regular C customers couldn't have their assets lent out margin trading customers had a separate to where they agreed that they could have their funds lent out and the theoretical argument is that whenever Alam borrowed money they weren't borrowing from regular customers they were borrowing from these margin lending customers which they were allowed to do the only issue with this is that Canon said that he quote previewed this argument with NAD and ramik and they had pulled some numbers that showed that it was not supported by the facts question did you Rel L that to the defendant answer yes how did he acknowledge it he said yep yep okay we know this is true because of Peter Easton's testimony earlier who showed some of these numbers on this graph in red you have how much Alam owed customers and in green you have how much Alam was borrowing in the spot margin program as you can see there are billions of dollars still missing that couldn't be explained by this argument despite this Sam would still try to use it later in interviews with people like George Stephanopoulos my understanding is a few things happen the first is there is a margin trading facility on FTX by which users can lend out funds by which other users borrow funds and so there are explicit cases where there is you know marging extended where there is borrow lending if Alam is borrowing the money that belongs to FDX depositors that's a bright red line isn't it there are a lot of cases where that's actually explicitly part of the programs and that are happening not here here it says that the digital assets may not be loaned to FTX trading as you can see there Sam is just sort of trying out this argument see if anyone bites uh but even at the time I knew that this couldn't be true because we had evidence that it wasn't and I confronted Sam about it but I talked to somebody from Alama and asked how big the position of like or how many people had assets in the type of accounts that that terms of service would apply to versus the regular terms of service which said you couldn't use their money and they said it was about a billion that was in the margin trading or the the margin like U side of things where you could reuse their funds or whatever and there was the rest of it was not there so does that mean the rest of the money was stolen I mean like it seems like you're putting all your eggs behind this one excuse about you know there was this separate side of the terms of service how do you address everyone else so I don't have all the day in front of me my memory is that it was substantially more than a billion um in the margin trading program um but I don't have that day in front of me right now so I can't verify that well now we do have the real numbers and of course as K's son his lawyer told Sam at the time the argument makes no sense because the numbers just don't support what he's saying and we were right day 13 uh this basically marks the end of the prosecution's case and the beginning of the defenses now originally we said they didn't really have many people who were going to testify besides Sam bman freed eventually the defense did find one guy and that is Joseph pimbley A Financial Consultant who takes the stand next now his job is basically to undo the work of Peter Easton and provide an alternative Financial case to do this he claimed that 78% of accounts on FTX had spot margin lending in enabled trying to give credit to this margin lending explanation or to put it another way only $2 billion that were borrowed wouldn't be allowed to be honest this was pretty confusing because this basically flips Peter Easton's testimony on its head you have these two Financial experts basically both saying opposite things uh so to draw a distinction between these two witnesses the prosecution in Cross asked Mr pimbley if he had only looked at the FTX database says yes that is correct question you can't draw further conclusions beyond that correct they point out question you didn't look at the Fiat at account in FTX did you and you did not engage in any Financial tracing correct pimbley answers of course not no no sir the idea here being to distinguish Peter Easton as the person who actually traced crypto and Fiat whereas pimbley just looked at a single database that FTX maintained and could have tainted even though I guess they had a point here I I I do think this was a net win for the defense because the goal and I think what they achieved was muddying the waters by presenting their own set of numbers that was very different and look speaking of alternative stories this is where things got really interesting because the defense next calls up their star witness I guess Sam bankman freed to the stand all right let me start this by saying it is very risky when a defendant testifies because it can open you up to cross-examination but at this point I think everyone agreed that Sam doesn't really have much to lose and he loves to talk and so Sam's explanation for what happened the last few years began and you won't be surprised to find out that it's very different from the prosecution story now some of it consisted of innocent explanations things like how Sam autod deleted messages on Signal that a prosecution kind of implied he was hiding evidence Sam claims this was just a precaution he learned called the New York Times test where you want to avoid writing things down because a lot of innocuous things can look pretty bad out of context other times Sam wouldn't just say it was innocent he would claim ignorance of what was happening he would say things like I wasn't entirely sure what was happening and I wish I had a better understanding than I did and there were teams that were managing this process Sam even says he didn't even know about the $8 billion hole in his company called the Fiat ad account quot did you know what Fiat at was at the time no did you later learn yes Sam says he didn't even have conversations about it until October of 2022 which if you remember directly contradicts what we heard from other employees he even claims he was very surprised when he found out they owed a billion dollar basically his version of events has him the surprised CEO you know at the Helm of the Titanic who only finds out it's all sinking when it's too late to say and all of the illegal actions taken by his you know company were really because of Caroline Ellison NAD and Gary and all of it was without his knowledge and look look it's I guess it's a story it's a nice story but is it going to hold up to cross let's find [Music] out okay Sam is up on the stand Miss Sassoon is the lawyer for cross-examination he's basically evasive she's ruthless uh so here's what happened next Miss Sassoon asks were you not involved at all anomy to trading in 2022 Sam says I was not involved as a general principal in day-to-day trading then miss Sasson showed him being involved in day-to-day trading oxy and maps with text messages to Caroline saying quote $1 to $2 million of each over the next day or two question did you see that yep and so began the ruthless destruction of Sam's credibility he would say he didn't do something uh and and then basically we'd get hard evidence that he did we also got a really annoying strategy from Sam where he just would try to dodge every question about things he said in the past like do you recall that Sam would say not specifically but I'm not saying that I didn't or Miss Sassoon would ask yes or no you stated on this podcast you were not involved at all in Alam to trading Sam I don't recall what I said and then we would just hear this I wasn't super involved in Alam I was not involved at all in the trading um been for years things continue like this with Sam saying things like I'm not sure I don't remember quote I don't remember what I said in Miss as soon each time would show him exactly what he said he doesn't remember and Sam basically refused to say yes even to things that were obviously true like a question did you or did you not Market FTX internationally safe yes he did that like a million times he'd say I don't specifically remember that I'm not sure which I'm not sure the benefit of saying you don't remember this but there are definitely negatives to it which was pissing off the judge and the jury after all Sam's whole case rests on his version of events which is very different from everyone else's but when pressed on basic statements he made if he suddenly gets amnesia and can't recall why should anyone believe it when he does recall things this felt like a really big trap had been set for Sam and he kind of just walked right into it not that things went better for him when he did answer though because at some point Miss Sassoon asked about regulation and he did answer that question you wanted your followers to think that consumer protection was important to you right answer sure but this was really just for PR wasn't it answer no she then pulls up a message Sam himself wrote and had him read it out to the jury saying yeah just PR regulators and look that's a lot just on paper that's already so damning but having Sam himself actually repeat it back to the judge and jury just encapsulates this story so well because from the beginning Sam believed he can talk his way out of this only to have himself eviscerated not necessarily by other people but by his own words most of all there's just something so poetic about that and look cross- examination went on for a while but I think that was the most powerful moment for me personally and it concludes the major Revelations from his testimony so now after hearing all the evidence I think it's time for a jury [Music] decision all right we have a a verdict it's only been 3 hours since the jury started deliberating which usually means it was a fast decision so if you want to put in your thoughts at home I have the verdict right here um all seven counts guilty baby so this is a pretty happy ending obviously for me but we won't know the sentencing um until until March in fact I think it's a happy ending for a lot of the customers at least some cold comfort that there looks like there's going to be some justice done here and for this case for now it's over either way hope you enjoyed this detailed look at the FTX trial thanks for watching okay before you go I just wanted to say I'm going to
