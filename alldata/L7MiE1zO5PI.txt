what is Wolfram language in terms of sort of I mean I can answer the question for you but is it basically not the philosophical deep to profound the impact of it I'm talking about in terms of tools in terms of things you can download yeah you can play with what is it what what does it fit into the infrastructure what are the different ways to interact with it right so I mean that the two big things that people have sort of perhaps heard of that come from open language one is Mathematica the other is both NAFA so Mathematica first came out 1988 it's this system that is basically a instance of Wolfram language and it's used to do computations particularly in sort of technical areas and the typical thing you're doing is you're you're typing little pieces of computational language and you're getting computations done it's very kind of there's like as symbolic yeah it's a symbolic language so symbolic language I mean I don't know how to clean they express that but that makes a very distinct from what how we think about sort of I don't know programming in a ling like python or something right but so so the point is that in a traditional programming language the raw material of the programming language it's just stuff that computers intrinsically do and the point of often language is that what the language is talking about is things that exist in the world or things that we can imagine and construct not it's not it's not sort of it's it's aimed to be an abstract language from the beginning and so for example one feature it has is that it's a symbolic language which means that you know you think all you have an X you just type in X and what why would you just say oh that's X it won't say error undefined thing you know I don't know what it is computation you know for the put in terms of the in terms of computer now that X could perfectly well be you know the city of Boston that's a thing that's a symbolic thing or it could perfectly well be the you know the trajectory of some spacecraft represented as a symbolic thing and that idea that one can work with sort of computationally work with these different these kinds of things that that exist in the world or describe the world that's really powerful and that's what I mean you know when I started designing well I designed the predecessor of what's now often language the thing called SMP which was my first computer language I am I kind of wanted to have this the sort of infrastructure for computation which was as fundamental as possible I mean this is what I got for having bit of physicists and tried to find you know fundamental components of things and wound up with this kind of idea of transformation rules for symbolic expressions as being sort of the underlying stuff from which computation would be built and that's what we've been building from in Wolfram language and you know operationally what happens it's I would say by far the highest level computer language that exists and it's really been built in a very different direction from other languages so other languages have been about there is a liqueur language it really is kind of wrapped around the operations that a computer intrinsically does maybe people add libraries for this or that that but the goal of Wolfram language is to have the language itself be able to cover this sort of very broad range of things that show up in the world and that means that you know there are 6,000 primitive functions in the Wolfram language that cover things you know I could probably pick a a random here I'm gonna pick just because just for fun I'll pick them let's take a random sample of them of all the things that we have here so let's just say random sample of 10 of them and let's see what we get Wow ok so these are really different things from functions these are all functions boolean converts ok that's the thing for converting between different types of boolean expressions so for people are just listening human type 10 random sample names sampling from all functionally how many you said there might face thousand six thousand six thousand ten of them and there's a hilarious variety of them yeah right well we've got things about dollar request or a dress that has to do with interacting with the the world of the of the cloud and so on discrete wavelet data it's for ROI graphical to the window yeah yeah we know moveable that's the user interface kind of thing I want to pick another ten cuz I think this is some okay so yeah there's a lot of infrastructure stuff here that you see if you if you just start sampling at random there's a lot of kind of infrastructural things if you're more you know if you more look at the some of the exciting machine learning stuff is shut off is that also in this pool oh yeah yeah I mean you know so one of those functions is like image identify as a function here we just say image identify you know it's always good to let's do this let's say current image and let's pick up an image hopefully just an image accessing the webcam to picture yourself anyway we can say image identify open square brackets and then we just paste that picture in their image identify function of running comes in picture low and says oh wow it says look I look like a plunger because I got this great big thing behind me classify so this image identify classifies the most likely object in in the image in it so there's a wonder okay that's that's a bit embarrassing let's see what it does let's pick the top 10 um okay well it thinks there's oh it thinks it's pretty unlikely that it's a primary two hominid a puss eight percent probability yeah that's that's five seven it's a plunger yeah well so if we will not give you an existential crisis and then uh eight percent or not I should say percent but no that's a scent that it's a hominid um and yeah okay it's really I mean I'm gonna do another one of these just because I'm embarrassed that it there we go let's try that let's see what that did um we took a picture a little bit a little bit more of me and not just my bald head so to speak okay eighty-nine percent problem is it's a person so that so then I would um but you know so this is image identify as an example of one of just just one function and that's the heart of the that's like a part of the language yes I mean you know something like um I could say I don't know let's find the geo nearest what could we find let's find the nearest volcano um let's find the ten I wonder where it thinks here is let's try finding the ten volcano's nearest here okay give us your nearest volcano here 10 years volcanoes right let's find out where those oh we can now we got a list of volcanoes out and I can say geo list plot that and hopefully ok so there we go so there's a map that shows the positions of those ten volcanoes of the East Coast and the Midwest density well no we're okay okay there's no it's not too bad yeah they're not very close to us we could we could measure how far away they are but you know the fact that right in the language it knows about all the volcanoes in the world that knows you know computing what the nearest ones are it knows all the maps of the world and so on fundamentally different idea of what a language is yeah right that's that's why I like to talk about is you know a full scale computational language that's that's what we've tried to do and just if you can comment briefly I mean this kind of with the Wolfram language along with the Wolfram Alpha represents kind of what the dream of what AI is supposed to be there's now a sort of a craze of learning kind of idea that we can take raw data and from that extracted the different hierarchies of abstractions and in order to be able to under the kind of things that well from language operates with but we're very far from learning systems being able to form that but like what was the context of history of AI if you could just comment on there is a you said computation X and there's just some sense where in the 80's and 90's sort of expert systems represented a very particular computation ax yes all right and there's a kind of notion that those efforts didn't pan out right but then out of that emerges kind of Wolfram language Wolfram Alpha which is the I mean yeah I think those are in some sense those efforts were too modest they're nice they were they were looking at particular areas and you actually can't do it with a particular area I mean like like even a problem like natural language understanding it's critical to have broad knowledge of the world if you want to do good natural language understanding and you kind of have to bite off the whole problem if you if you say work is gonna do the block's world over here so to speak you don't really it's it's it's actually it's one of these cases where it's easier to do the whole thing than it is to do some piece of it you know what one comment to make about so the relationship between what we've tried to do and sort of the learning side of AI you know in a sense if you look at the development of knowledge in our civilization as a whole there was kind of this notion three three hundred years ago or so now you want to figure something out about the world you can reason it out you can do things which would just use raw human thought and then along came sort of modern mathematical science and we found ways to just sort of blast through that by in that case writing down equations now we also know we can do that with computation and so on um and so that was kind of a different thing so when we look at how do we sort of encode knowledge and figure things out one way we could do it is start from scratch learn everything it's just a neuron that figuring everything out but in a sense that denies the sort of knowledge-based achievements of our civilization because in our civilization we have learnt lots of stuff we've surveyed all the volcanoes in the world we've done you know we've figured out lots of algorithms for this or that those are things that we can encode computationally and that's what we've tried to do and we're not saying just you don't have to start everything from scratch so in a sense a big part of what we've done is to try and sort of capture the knowledge of the world in computational form in computable form now there's also some pieces which which were for a long time undoable by computers like image identification where there's a really really useful module that we can add that is those things which actually were pretty easy for humans to do that had been hard for computers to do I think the thing that's interesting that's a merger now is the interplay between these things between this kind of knowledge of the world that is in a sense very symbolic and this kind of sort of much more statistical kind of things like image identification and so on and putting those together by having this sort of symbolic representation of image identification that that's where things get really interesting and where you can kind of symbolically represent patterns of things and images and so on um I think that's you know that's kind of a part of the path forward so to speak yeah so the dream of so the machine learning is not when in my view I think the view of many people is not any more close to building the kind of wide world of computable knowledge that Wolfram don't think we should build but because you have a kind of you've you've done the incredibly hard work of building this world now machine learning too can be serviced tools to help you explore that world yeah and that's what you've added I mean right now with the version 12 oh yeah if you all seeing some demos it looks amazing right I mean I think you know this it's sort of interesting to see the this sort of the once it's computable once it's in there it's running in sort of a very efficient computational way but then there's sort of things like the interface of how do you get there you know how do you do natural language understanding to get there how do you how do you pick out entities in a big piece of text or something that's I mean actually a good example right now is our NLP NL which is we've done a lot of stuff natural language understanding using essentially not learning based methods using a lot of you know a little algorithmic methods human curation methods and so on and so on people try to enter a query and then converting so the process of converting NLU defined beautifully as converting their query into computation come into a computational language which is a very well first of all super practical definition a very useful definition and then also a very clear definition right right right so I mean a different thing is natural language processing where it's like here's a big lump next go pick out all the cities in that text for example and so a good example of you know so we do that we're using using modern machine learning techniques um and it's actually kind of kind of an interesting process that's going on right now it's this loop between what do we pick up with NLP you using machine learning versus what do we pick up with our more kind of precise computational methods in natural language understanding and so we've got this kind of loop going between those which is improving both of them yeah I think you have some of the state-of-the-art transforms okay have Bert in there I think oh you know so Josie of you're integrating all the models I mean this is the hybrid thing that people have always dreamed about are talking about that makes she's just surprised frankly that Wolfram language is not more popular than already it already is you know that's that's a it's a it's a complicated issue because it's like it involves you know it involves ideas and ideas are absorbed absorbed slowly in the world I mean I think then there's sort of like we're talking about there's egos and personalities and and some of the the absorption absorption mechanisms of ideas have to do with personalities and the students of personalities and and then a little social network so it's it's interesting how the spread of ideas works you know what's funny with Wolfram language is that we are if you say you know what market sort of market penetration if you look at the I would say very high-end of Rd and sort of the the people where you say wow that's a really you know impressive smart person there very often uses of or from language very very often if you look at the more sort of it's a funny thing if you look at the more kind of I would say people who are like oh we're just plodding away doing what we do they're often not yet Wolfram language users and that dynamic it's kind of odd that there hasn't been more rapid trickle down because we really you know the high-end we've really been very successful in for a long time and it's it's some but was you know that's partly I think a consequence of my fault in a sense because it's kind of you know I have a company which is really emphasizes sort of creating products and building a sort of the best possible technical tower we can rather than sort of doing the commercial side of things and pumping it out and so yeah most effective what and there's an interesting idea that you know perhaps you can make more popular by opening everything everything up sort of the github bottle but there's an interesting I think I've heard you discussed this that that turns out not to work in a lot of cases like in this particular case that you want it you know that when you deeply care about the integrity the quality of the knowledge that you're building that unfortunately you can't you can't distribute that effort yeah it's not the nature of how things work I mean you know what we're trying to do is a thing that for better or worse requires leadership and it requires kind of maintaining a coherent vision over a long period of time and doing not only the cool vision related work but also the kind of mundane in the trenches make the thing actually work well work how do you build the knowledge because that's the fascinating thing that's the mundane the fascinating in the mundane as well building the knowledge they're adding integrating more data yeah I mean that's probably not the most stunning that the things like get it to work in all these different cloud environments and so on that's pretty you know it's very practical stuff you know have the user interface be smooth and you know have there be take on him you know a fraction of a millisecond to do this or that that's a lot of work and it's some it's it's but you know I think my it's an interesting thing over the period of time you know often language has existed basically for more than half of the total amount of time that any language any computer language has existed that is computer language maybe 60 years old you know give or take um and both languages 33 years old so it's it's kind of a.m. and I think I was realizing recently there's been more innovation in the distribution of software than probably than in the structure of programming languages over that period of time and we you know we've been sort of trying to do our best to adapt to it and the good news is that we have you know because I have a simple private company and so on that doesn't have you know a bunch of investors you know telling us we're gonna do this so that they have lots of freedom in what we can do and so for example we're able to oh I don't know we have this free Wolfram engine for developers which is a free version for developers and we've been you know we've they're a site licenses for for mathematical more from language basically all major universities certainly in the u.s. by now so it's effectively free to people and all the universities in effect and you know we've been doing a progression of things I mean different things like Wolfram Alpha for example the main website is just a free website what is Wolfram Alpha okay both now for is a system for answering questions where you ask in question with natural language and it'll try and generate a report telling you the answer to that question so the question could be something like you know what's the population of Boston divided by New York compared to New York and it'll take those words and give you an answer and that have been verts the words into computable and into into Wolfram language a common language in the additional language and then could use the points in underlying knowledge belongs to Wolfram Alpha to the Wolfram language what's the let's call it the Wolfram knowledge base knowledge base I mean it's it's been a that's been a big effort over the decades to collect all that stuff and you know more of it flows in every second so can you just pause on that for a second like that's the one of the most incredible things of course in the long term were from language itself is the fundamental thing but in the amazing sort of short term the the knowledge base is kind of incredible so what's the process of building in that knowledge base the fact that you first of all from the very beginning that you're brave enough to start to take on the general knowledge base and how do you go from zero to the incredible knowledge base that you have now well yeah it was kind of scary at some level I mean I had I had wondered about doing something like this since I was a kid so it wasn't like I hadn't thought about it for a while but most of us most of the brilliant dreamers give up such a such a difficult engineering notion at some point right right well the thing that happened with me which was kind of it's a it's a live your own paradigm kind of theory so basically what happened is I had assumed that to build something like wolf malphur would require sort of solving the general AI problem that's what I had assumed and so I kept on thinking about that and I thought I don't really know how to do that so I don't do anything then I worked on my new kind of science project instead of exploring the computational universe and came up with things like this principle of computational equivalence which say there is no bright line between the intelligence and the milli computational so I thought look that's this paradigm I've built you know now it's you know now I have to eat that dog food myself so to speak you know I've been thinking about doing this thing with computable knowledge forever and you know let me actually try and do it and so it was you know if my if my paradigm is right then this should be possible but the beginning was certainly you know is a bit daunting I remember I took that the the the early team to a big reference library and we like looking at this reference library and it's like you know my basic statement is our goal over the next year or two is to ingest everything that's in here and that's you know it seemed very daunting but but in a sense I was well aware of the fact that it's finite you know the fact you can walk into the reference library it's a big big thing with lots of reference books all over the place but it is finite you know there's not an infinite you know it's not the infinite corridor of so to speak of a reference library it's not truly infinite so to speak but but no I mean and then then what happened was sort of interesting there was from a methodology point of view was I didn't start off saying let me have a grand theory for how all this knowledge works it was like let's you know implement this area this area this area of hundred areas and so on it's long work I also found that you know i-i've been fortunate in that our products get used by sort of the world's experts and lots of areas and so that really helped because we were able to ask people you know the world expert on this or that and were able to ask them for input and so on and I found that my general principle was that any area where there wasn't some expert who helped us figure out what to do wouldn't be right and you know because our goal was to kind of get to the point where we had sort of true expert level knowledge about everything and so that you know that the ultimate goal is if there's a question that can be answered on the basis of general knowledge and a civilization make it be automatic to be able to answer that question and you know and now what Walton I forgot used in Syria from the very beginning and it's now as you know like sir and so it's people are kind of getting more of the you know they get more of the sense of this is what should be possible to do I mean in a sense the question-answering problem was viewed as one of the sort of core AI problems for a long time I had kind of an interesting experience I had a friend Marvin Minsky who was a well-known a AI person from from right around here and I remember when my morph novel was coming out um as a few weeks before I came out I think I happened to see Marvin and I said I should show you this thing we have you know it's a question answering system and he was like okay type something and it's like okay fine and then he's talking about something different I said no Marvin you know this time it actually works you know look at this it actually works these types and a few more things there's maybe ten more things of course we have a record of what he's typed in which is kind of interesting but and they do I can you share where his mind was in the testing space like what whoa all kinds of random things he's trying random stuff you know medical stuff and you know chemistry stuff and you know astronomy and so on I think was like like you know after a few minutes he was like oh my god it actually works and the the but that was kind of told you something about the state you know what what happened in AI because people had you know in a sense by trying to solve the bigger problem we were able to actually make something that would work now to be fair you know we had a bunch of completely unfair advantages for example we already built a bunch of often language which was you know very high level symbolic language we had you know I had the practical experience of building big systems I have the sort of intellectual confidence to not just sort of give up and doing something like this I think that the you know it is a it's always a funny thing you know I've worked on a bunch of big projects in my life and I would say that the you know you mention ego I would also mention optimism so does very careful I mean in you know if somebody said this project is gonna take 30 years its I you know it would be hard to sell me on that you know I'm always in the in the well I can kind of see a few years you know something's gonna happen a few years and and usually does something happens in a few years but the whole the tale can be decades long and that's a that's a you know from a personal point of view or is the challenges you end up with these projects that have infinite tales and the question is do the tales kind of do you just drown in kind of dealing with all of the tales of these projects and that's that's an interesting sort of personal challenge and like my efforts now to work on fundamental theory of physics which I've just started doing and I'm having a lot of fun with it but it's kind of you know it's it's kind of making a bet that I can I can kind of like you know I can do that as well as doing the incredibly energetic things that I'm trying to do with all from language and so on I mean vision yeah and underlying that I mean I just talked for the second time with Elon Musk and that you you to share that quality a little bit of that optimism of taking on basics we do the daunting what most people call impossible and he knew take it on out of you can call it ego you can call it naivety you can call it optimism whatever the heck it is but that's how you solve the impossible things yeah I mean look at what happens and I don't know you know in my own case I know it's been I progressed oligo a bit more confident and progressively able to you know decide that these projects aren't crazy but then the other thing is the other the other trap the one can end up with is oh I've done these projects and they're big let me never do a project that's any smaller than any project I've done so far and that's yeah you know and that can be a trap and and often these projects are of completely unknown you know that their depth and significance is actually very hard to know yeah I'm the sort of building this giant knowledge base is behind well from language WolframAlpha what do you think about the internet what do you think about for example Wikipedia these large aggregations of text that's not converted into computable knowledge do you think you would if you look at Wolfram language Wolfram Alpha 20 30 maybe 50 years down the line do you hope to store all of the sort of Google's dream is to make all information searchable accessible but that's really as defined it's it's a it doesn't include the understanding of information right do you hope to make all of knowledge represented with the hope so that's what we're trying to do it hard is that problem they could closing that gap well it depends on the use cases I mean so if it's a question of answering general knowledge questions about the world we're in pretty good shape on that right now if it's a question of representing like an area that we're going into right now is computational contracts being able to take something which would be written in legalese it might even be the specifications for you know what should the self-driving car do when it encounters the so that or the other what should the you know whatever they you know write that in a computational language and be able to express things about the world you know if the creature that you see running across the road is a you know thing at this point in the you know Tree of Life then it's worth this way otherwise don't those kinds of things are there ethical components when you start to get to some of the messy human things are those in encoder well into computable knowledge well I think that it is a necessary feature of attempting to automate more in the world that we encode more and more of ethics in a way that gets sort of quickly you know is able to be dealt with by computer I mean I've been involved recently I sort of got backed into being involved in the question of automated content selection on the Internet so you know the Facebook's Google's Twitter's you know what how do they rank the stuff they feed to us humans so to speak and the question of what are you know what should never be fed to us what should be blocked forever what should be up ranked you know and what is the what are the current principles behind that and what I kind of well a bunch of different things I realized about that but one thing that's interesting is being able you know in effect you're building sort of an AI ethics you have to build an AI ethics module in effect to decide is this thing so shocking I'm not going to show it to people is this thing so whatever and and I did realize in thinking about that that you know there's not gonna be one of these things it's not possible to decide or it might be possible but it would be really bad for the future of our species if we just decided there's this one AI FX module and it's going to determine the the the practices of everything in the world so to speak and I kind of realized one has to sort of break it up and that's an that's an interesting societal problem of how one does that and how one sort of has people sort of self-identify for you know I'm buying in in the case of just content selection it's sort of easier because it's like an individual or an individual it's not something that cuts across sort of societal boundaries but it's a really interesting notion of I heard you'd describe I really like it sort of maybe in the sort of have different AI systems that have a certain kind of brand that they represent essentially you could have like I don't know whether it's conserve conservative or liberal and then libertarian and there's an R and E an Objectivist like system a different ethical and Co I mean it's almost encoding some of the ideologies which we've been struggling I come from the Soviet Union that didn't work out so well with the ideologies they worked out there is so you you have but they also everybody purchased that particular ethic system indeed and in the same I suppose could be done encoded that that system could be encoded into computational knowledge and allow us to explore in the realm of in the digital space as that's the right exciting possibility are you playing with those ideas and or from language yeah yeah I mean the the the you know that's we often language has sort of the best opportunity to kind of express those essentially computational contracts about what to do now there's a bunch more work to be done to do it in practice for you know deciding the is this a credible news story what does that mean or whatever whatever else do kind of pick I think that that's um you know that's the the question of well exactly what we get to do with that is you know for me it's kind of a complicated thing because there are these big projects that I think about like you know find the fundamental theory of physics okay that's possible one right bucks number two you know solve the IIx problem in the case of you know figure out how you rank all content so to speak and decide what people see that's that's kind of a box number two so to speak these are big projects and and I think for anything is more important the the fundamental nature of reality or depends who you ask it's one of these things that's exactly like you know what's the ranking right it's the it's the ranking system now it's like who's who's module do you use to rank that if you and I think come having multiple modules is really compelling notion to us humans in a world where there's not clear that there's a right answer it perhaps you have systems that operate under different how would you say it I mean it's different value systems based different value systems I mean I think you know in a sense the I mean I'm not really a politics oriented person but but you know in the kind of totalitarianism it's kind of like you're gonna have this this system and that's the way it is I mean kind of the you know the concept was sort of a market-based system where you have okay I as a human I'm going to pick this system I is another human I'm going to pick this system I mean that's in a sense this case of automated content selection is a non-trivial but it is probably the easiest of the AI ethics situations because it is each person gets to pick for themselves and there's not a huge interplay between what different people pick by the time you're dealing with other societal things like you know what should the policy of the central bank could be or something or healthcare says allow this kind of centralized kind of things right well I mean healthcare again has the feature that that at some level each person can pick for themselves so to speak I mean whereas there are other things where there's a necessary Public Health that's one example well that's not where that doesn't get to be you know something which people can what they pick for themselves they may impose on other people and then it becomes a more non-trivial piece of sort of political philosophy of course the central banking system some would argue we would move we need to move away into digital currency and so on and Bitcoin and Ledger's and so on so yes there's a lot of we've been quite involved in that and that's it that's where that's sort of the motivation for computational contracts in part comes out of you know this idea oh we can just have this autonomously executing smart contract the idea of a computational contract is just to say you know have something where all of the conditions of the contract are represented in computational form so in principle it's automatic text secured the contract and I think that's you that will surely be the future of you know the idea of legal contracts written in English or legalese or whatever and where people have to argue about what goes on is it surely not you know we have a much more streamlined process if everything can be represented computationally and the computers can kind of decide what to do I mean ironically enough you know old gottfried leibniz back in the you know 1600s was saying exactly the same thing but he had you know his pinnacle of technical achievement was this brass for function mechanical calculator thing that never really worked properly actually um and you know so he was like 300 years too early for that idea but now that idea is pretty realistic I think and you know you asked how much more difficult is it than what we have now I'm often language to express I call it symbolic discourse language being able to express sort of everything in the world in kind of computational symbolic form um I I think it is absolutely within reach I mean I think it's a you know I don't know maybe I'm just too much of an optimist but I think it's a it's a limited number of years to have a pretty well built out version of that that will allow one to encode the kinds of things that are relevant to typical legal contracts and and these kinds of things the idea of symbolic discourse language can you try to define the scope of what of what it is so we're having a conversation it's a natural language can we have a representation of these sort of actionable parts of that conversation in a precise computable form so that a computer could go do it and not just contracts but really sort of some of the things we think of as common sense essentially even just like basic notions of human life well I mean things like you know I am I'm getting hungry and want to eat something right right that that's something we don't have a representation you know in wolfen language right now if I was like I'm eating blueberries and raspberries and things like that and I'm eating this amounts of them we know all about those kinds of fruits and plants and nutrition content and all that kind of thing but the I want to eat them part of it is not covered yet um and that you know you need to do that in order to have a complete symbolic discourse language to be else I have a natural language conversation right right to be able to express the kinds of things that say you know if it's a legal contract it's you know the parties desire to have this and that and that's you know that's a thing like I want to eat a bras berry or something that that's isn't that day isn't this just throwing you said it's centuries old this dream yes but it's also the more near-term the dream of touring in four million a touring test yes so do you do you hope do you think that's the ultimate test of creating something special we said I tell I think my special look if the test is does it walk and talk like a human well that's just the talking like a human but um the answer is it's an okay test if you say is it a test of intelligence you know people have attached wolf alpha the wolf now for API - you know Turing test BOTS and those BOTS just lose immediately because all you have to do is ask you five questions that you know are about really obscure weird pieces of knowledge and it's just drop them right out and you say that's not a human ID it's it's a it's a different thing it's achieving a different right now but it's yeah I would argue not I would argue it's not a different thing it's actually legitimately Wolfram Alpha is legitimately languor Wolfram language only is legitimately trying to solve the torrent Dean tent of the Turing test perhaps the intent yeah perhaps the intent I mean it's actually kind of fun you know I'm touring trying to work out he's thought about taking encyclopedia britannica and you know making it computational in some way and he estimated how much work it would be and actually I have to say he was a bit more pessimistic than the reality we did it more efficiently but to him that represent so I mean he was that he was on the fighting mental tasks yeah right he believes that had the same idea I mean it was you know we were able to do it more efficiently because we had a lot we had layers of automation that he I think hadn't you know it's it's hard to imagine those layers of abstraction um that end up being being built up but to him it represented like an impossible task essentially well he saw it was difficult he thought it was you know maybe if he'd live another 50 years he would have been able to do it I don't know you
