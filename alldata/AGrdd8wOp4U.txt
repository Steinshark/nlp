ladies and gentlemen it's currently about 9 30 in the morning here in New York City and I started my day today by doing what any normal person does after they wake up I started reminiscing about the time that I made a video about Martin chessbot and it got to 10 million views now hopefully if you're watching this in the future it has even more views than that and I was thinking to myself how do I get back to the Glory Days that is my most viewed video and it's not even close and in that video I played against the worst bot on chess.com AKA Martin and I gave him 30 queens and I thought why don't I pair Martin against Martin now you can't really do that so I had to basically play a game with white and with black and just mirror the moves and oh my God it did not disappoint okay this is what happens when you pair Martin chessbot against Martin chespa it's it's this is chess at a at a level of which I don't think I was ever prepared to see by the way beating Martin chessbot when he had 30 Queens uh I think they boosted Martin and we're gonna see exactly what I mean so Martin starts the game with the move E4 now Martin then responds with the move H5 which is typical Martin Behavior right like this this this makes sense um this is going to be quite a long battle however now uh Martin with white plays the move Knight to C3 I guess trying to play a Vienna just in general A good rule of thumb is if you can put two Pawns in the center of the board it's pretty much always going to be the best move here the computer does in fact say that this is the best move for white uh but Knight C3 has played and now the other Martin goes back to playing normally again you should play D4 here but I don't hate Knight F3 and white plays D4 anyway so Martin with white it I I don't even know who that is I mean that that could be mittens in Disguise uh a mittens in a Martin's clothing now now Martin with black here makes his presence known very quickly as he promptly plays the move Rook H7 which which is just a very stupid move a very stupid move it's stupid because it doesn't improve your position at all you also now cannot castle that way you've lost the right to Castle and also your Rook will just be a Target or like this now Martin with white plays Bishop C4 I mean somebody reprogrammed this 250 ELO bot this is the worst bot that chess.com has and it's playing like I don't know at least the 2000 rated player uh now Martin with black does not get any better he plays King to D7 so um black has played Four moves he has moved pawns and a rook now of course developing a pawn or a knight or a knight is good but King to D7 is is just not a good move in fact Knight to E5 check is already winning for white because after Pawn takes Pawn takes you're butchering the king to the queen and there's actually no way for the king to stay guarding the queen if this sack and then you win the queen after King takes and if King C7 you just play Knight B5 and then the game actually ends even more promptly with some sort of double you know they just discovered attack on the king um but Martin botches takes the pawn so black is down a pawn has no development and has a king in front of the pieces okay typical Martin Behavior black now develops the queen okay uh that Knight is hanging by the way uh but Martin plays at a higher degree of understanding and just castles I mean who can blame him he's put two Pawns in the center he's up a pawn he's got both Knights out and he castled his King better all right it's like a recovering of but it's like anybody who improves from an otherwise very bad situation Knight to F6 and now Martin plays rookie one this is excellent stuff and now he's gonna look to open up the position because Black's King is on the other side that makes perfect sense perfect sense uh black plays Knight G4 and I don't hate White's next move Queen D3 I mean you know maybe you're looking to to Target like this may be white wants E5 like maybe secretly uh White is a genius a black plays Pawn to E6 and now white plays Knight H4 now I'm not gonna lie to you I cannot I cannot explain this move but I don't really care because it's not a blunder of a piece uh black now plays Queen B6 which adds a little bit of pressure to that pawn uh and white now repeats moves now Martin Martin likes to finish games okay Martin is a fast finisher it's why he has children and he sometimes will repeat moves in the middle of a like he'll just play Knight H4 Queen B6 and Knight F3 back and I thought okay well they're just gonna repeat moves three times and you know it'll be a draw um which has happened but no Knight H6 and black is like I'm gonna get this bishop now of course white should move the bishop or white should play danger levels or or so on but actually Knight D2 and black takes on F7 oh my God oh my God black Martin well I have no evidence of that but Martin playing with the black pieces uh has captured the bishop on F7 uh White NOW plays the move F3 which is just simply a bad move and now black has the advantage black has the advantage the pawn can be captured excellent stuff look at that and now Knight E5 and Knight C6 and now it doesn't matter that uh Martin's King is in the center because Martin can go here uh the White Knight goes to A4 attacking the queen on B6 and now the queen slides over and targets the knight uh but here Martin with white plays Queen takes D4 simultaneously winning a pawn and defending his Knight and Martin with black plays Pawn to E5 attacking the queen queen to C4 offers an exchange of Queens which white white should not be trading Queens here not a good idea white should not be trading Queens because white is down material and not to mention after the queen trade there could be a fork uh admittedly the fork isn't as effective because there is Knight B6 check and then you know something like this but uh you're gonna win the night because it's gonna get trapped so um but none of that happens because here the 250 elobot strikes black plays B5 right away and that blunders Queen takes F7 check but instead of that white hangs his Queen brutal yeah tough it was just a matter of time um however uh one redeeming quality is the fact that we know that Martin playing with black will probably blunder something as well well let us begin the second phase of the game the opening has concluded uh kind of like the first plot twist of the movie has occurred and now the villain is ahead white plays the move H3 white doesn't really know what to do the truth is when you're playing against the queen Sometimes the best thing to do is to sit back and relax what black should do now is probably launch an attack over here make making sure their King is protected or simplify or take a free night King E7 yeah what you shouldn't do when you are up a queen and have a bunch of pieces is probably move your king king E7 is not a good move now the Knight comes back to safety and black plays the move Bishop to E6 developing a bishop and safeguarding the pawn on C4 as well as the square on D5 white now makes yet another king move which basically doesn't make any sense black at this point should either attack the king or open up the position or finish up development black should not move the king back to D7 that is just not a smart move white continues to move the king because he's getting back to his old uh alcoholism Knight to d8 a move that I cannot fully explain to you but it does not blunder the night so I don't really mind and now white plays the move Rook to be one which according to stockfish is the second best move and you know that says a lot because Martin is 3 500 points lower than stockfish black now plays King to E8 returning the king to his homeland and his home Square maybe at that point he will return all the other pieces to their home squares as well white plays the move Pawn to A3 because I don't know what the hell else you're gonna do you're dead lost now white plays King to F2 because I don't know what the hell you're gonna do you're now dead lost and then white plays King to G3 because I don't know the king is just enjoying walking around the barracks of his castle while his Queen is perished and all his other pieces are anemic and unable to participate in the battle Pawn to A5 for reasons I cannot fully comprehend Knight to D5 Galloping into his opponent's position but unable to land any threat because the horse cannot do damage to an entire Castle on its own rookie 1 A4 rookie two Rook H7 mindlessly shuffling the Rooks back and forth as they have probably overdosed on some sort of poppy seed Rook A1 Knight E6 Pawn to B4 and now a legendary moment in the history of Chess as martinbot has accidentally allowed the rare double ompason both pawns can pass on at the same time that's crazy I don't know if I've ever seen that I ain't gonna lie I don't know when the line and of course yeah yeah he he doesn't he wastes his opportunity white plays the move H4 black plays the move Bishop D7 again black is just mindlessly shuffling I think he's also kind of trying to disrespect his opponent a little bit here he sort of senses that like white doesn't have anything to do so he's gonna show about all right he's uh essentially What's Happening Here is Martin bought with the black pieces hurt his opponent early in the fight however all of Martin bot's Friends BET on the fight to end in the ninth round and it's the second round so what do you do in a 12 round boxing fight when it's the second round then you dropped your opponent you make the fight last until the ninth round that's how it works alright so Knight to D4 Knight to B5 Queen retreating out of the position now even white takes a pawn look at that Knight takes C4 all right fantastic stuff here Rook a one Knight C6 black is just awful and he's not concerned back and forth and back maybe maybe white will even get back into the game all right Knight to C4 look at this shuffling Rook H7 he's like I'm not too concerned who's the who's to say that I even want to win this game all right Knight AC4 King F7 and and now black says okay it's time to put my foot on the gas Knight takes Pawn all right I took a pawn all right and now my Pawn is three squares away from queening so this could be a problem all right and now white starts coming in Bishop F6 attacks The Rook black moves Pawn to C4 attacking the Knight on A3 all right this is this is pretty dang stuff here and black misses it now Kira Martin does something just absolutely Sensational the move Pawn to C4 was played in order to open up the rook's vision on the night and the Knight couldn't have taken the pawn because it was protected by the other night so with the rook's New Vision on the night white goes here that is an exceptionally stupid move I mean Martin literally had to go two more squares that's it he went here instead I I like I don't I don't know what to tell you I I really I don't know it's like you were driving to a destination and you saw it but you you parked the car like two miles away I I don't I don't know now black plays Pawn to G5 that's just the Free Pawn Bishop D7 now there is a hanging Knight and a hanging rook and if you take the Rook The Rook used to protect that square so maybe you can play Knight F6 Knight F6 will win you the queen now perhaps what Martin saw in this position was that if you take the queen you actually get mated I I don't think Martin saw that uh Knight E3 back Knight B1 all right so now there is a hanging rook and another hanging Rook wow Queen G6 pinning the bishop to the king but blundering the Knight over here doesn't take it damn now the Knight escapes all right now the when we unpin ourselves and now white starts advancing now the Bishops are staring at each other that's just the free night that pawn could become a queen at any moment the Knight can Gallop in and eat everybody and let's not forget black is up a queen Rook D2 Rook F2 Pawn to G3 a lot of absent-minded shuffling Ponto F4 finally maybe something is going to open up nope just kidding Pawn to F5 what is even the count black is up 10 points of material okay whoa I had an alarm set for 9.50 I had an alarm set for 9 55. very funny um I I woke up many many hours ago uh Rook to D7 Rook to D2 and as we see black is still showboating a little bit but he takes a pawn and now it's time Against All Odds black in this position does something absolutely sensational here Martin bot stops stalling the clock and finally lands a devastating blow Bishop takes H4 you cannot take the bishop because of the pin and now Martin is going to put the beat on Martin Rook B2 and yes he loses the pawn on A4 but now Martin plays Queen takes G3 and for the first time in this game Mateen 6 has appeared in the evaluation Queen takes G3 and that's it and then here martinbot plays the smartest stupidest thing I have ever seen him play Martin in this position following up on the heels of this infiltration plays the move King to h8 you would think King to h8 is back to the old ways of shuffling mindlessly and not doing anything of substance king2h8 is a brilliant move you are just too dumb to understand it the point of King to h8 is to free up the G7 Square what how does the G7 Square in any way shape or form have to do with this Square how does that move because Black's next move is Bishop G8 followed by Rook G7 it took a little while Martin bot played King 2h8 with the intention of playing Rook to G7 now you might say Levy couldn't he have just played Bishop E8 and Rook G7 could he have played Bishop D5 and then Rook G7 sacrificing the bishop and the answer to your question is shut up you elitist scum Martin did it all right Martin is essentially playing chess with 75 percent of his brain physically removed from his skull and he still found King h8 and Bishop G8 and Rook G7 it took him a little while all right but he did it Rook to B3 and now it's mate and Martin in this position plays Queen E1 and that is it unbelievable Against All Odds he kept his Queen safe for 92 moves this is a bot that once lost 30 queens in a game and he won a queen and he kept the queen safe and not only did he keep the queen safe the queen is going to deliver Checkmate on the G2 square and win the game Queenie one check Knight F1 Queen okay fine we're going back to stalling Bishop to A7 Queen takes F1 Queen okay okay fine at least you're blocking the bishop and you're forking the Rooks I respect it okay not Queen F1 Queen F1 or queen E4 queen of Martin Queen F1 okay Martin's Queen is hanging he could still play the mate he can move the queen to any safe oh it was almost perfect it was almost perfect now black is still winning black is a three points of material which is a bishop and he does in fact immediately Play Bishop takes C4 which is a great move but oh that's painful and um folks we have now crossed the 100 move threshold do you ever think you could last this long a hundred moves we have witnessed 200 ply Martin versus Martin meaning each side has made 100 turns we have just watched 200 moves of Chess that is nuts and we have another phase of the game now because we don't know what the hell is gonna happen King G1 Pawn to H4 Knight C6 this Pawn could still Queen all right Knight to D3 oh my God oh my God from bad to worse oh he lost the Knight he's now barely up oh God oh he he only has one move here to claim any advantage it's Pawn to D5 to try to play like this and he plays it he plays Pawn to D5 now Rook to B3 Now Pawn to D4 hits the bishop and activates the bishop to hit the Rook but instead he goes that way okay the king moves up I don't know where the king is going black plays Rook C7 and for the second time this game the Rooks are on this side of the board oh my goodness now white plays Bishop B6 with the intention of playing I don't know what rookie 3 play to try to stop the pawns Rook H7 shoving The Rook off the g-file and undeveloping it putting it behind the king dangerous stuff here Rook A3 looking to infiltrate along the side now The Rook bounces to F7 I don't really know what's happening but that's Rook A5 now the King goes back to G7 all right now Martin with the black pieces here performs Rook Shadow clone Jutsu with Rook G7 kick H6 Rook H7 Rook F7 King G7 it's like playing 2048 you ever play that game on your phone where you go Knight B8 now we have Knight to E6 look at this Tetris piece Battleship formation all right Knight infiltrating on D4 Bishop back to d8 for reasons I can't fully comprehend maybe to double the Rooks on the file now we have Rook 2a8 white is trying to complete the black formation of pieces on the opposite side of the board we have Bishop to C7 which simultaneously could become useful for attacking the king should the pawn ever move and also the Knight is being hit and Rook Cafe could pin the Knight to The Rook black plays a white plays King H1 Rook 7 F6 now we have Knight to E2 for the first time in about a million years white by the way is not even losing all right Rook to A6 Knight E2 it was made in a few moves somehow but it's it's not happening now we have a knight hitting a rook we have a rook seeing a rook everything is a hanging we have King to G8 white has now officially got a winning position for the first time in nearly 100 moves white can take the Rook The Rook or the bishop white plays Rook to G2 now the Knight is hanging and the bishop is hanging and The Rook is hanging black plays Knight to G3 which is a fantastic move now here white has to play Rook takes takes and the Knight takes F6 and then Knight takes D5 but that doesn't happen instead of that White's 120th move is King to G1 blundering Rook F1 after which it would be a smothered mate in the corner of the board but Bishop H7 Martin doesn't see it now white is completely winning once again we have made it to the 120th move of this battle Bishop to H6 hanging Checkmate in three once again Bishop A5 what is happening why is the bishop taking a gander on the other side of the board white plays Knight B1 blundering Rook F1 yet again but now King F7 white plays Bishop f8 why is the bishop sneaking around back nobody gave it permission Rook F3 oh my God you were two squares away two squares away from making okay you've lost the bishop but just just go down it was just you just went two squares to play Rook F1 Pawn to H3 oh my God oh my God now the Knight is no longer defended so Rook F1 is not even a mate anymore white plays Knight to D2 black plays Rook to F5 and and that's it I mean you just you're gonna take you're gonna take this and this and you are gonna lose all your Rooks Knight takes F3 is game over I mean Knight takes F3 and black is going to lose all their Rooks but white plays Rook A7 which I don't really hate it activates the Rook black plays Rooks to C3 trying to sneak around down the C file now Knight takes E5 is double checked but we have Rook A8 now we have King E6 this is nuts this is the Russian Roulette of Chess when Martin bot plays Martin bot it is literally load bullets into a chamber spin it and see what happens Rook hates you back Rook to D3 for reasons I cannot explain blundering a fork King E6 and Rook on D3 white plays Rook H2 and now there are even ideas to accidentally mate yourself but we have root going back to F7 we have Rook to A4 that is 130 moves played now as Knight to C5 once again was a missed opportunity Knight to H5 and that's it white will never get checkmated now Knight to C5 is yet again another Fork but in this position on the 131st move of the game white played Knight to B1 and Knight to B1 allows martinbot to play something here that Martin bought will never miss if you give Martin bought Checkmate in one Martin will find it Rook to D1 and on the 131st move of the battle of Martin's 2023. Martin defeated Martin with the black pieces now get out of here
