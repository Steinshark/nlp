hello everyone and welcome in this video we're going to be focusing on the question is the subaru sti really a rally car because whether it's the big auto magazines the marketing advertisements or the subaru forums there's certainly a rally aura surrounding this vehicle that appeal is part of why the subaru sti was the first new car i ever bought a 2014 hatch in world rally blue something i still absolutely adore to this day with its rally racing proportions and aggressive body features but the first time i took my subaru on anything other than smooth pavement it didn't exactly feel at home the suspension is very stiff and there's not much ground clearance sure the all-wheel drive system is fantastic but there are plenty of vehicles with great all-wheel drive systems that doesn't exactly make them rally cars so here's where the pros come in dirt fish rally school based in snoqualmie washington invited me to their three-day rally program here i was able to chat with their instructors and technicians many of whom participate in rally racing across the country these folks know the sport over the three days on top of dialing in driving techniques i was curious to learn about what physical changes they make to these cars in order to have them properly set up as rally cars ready to thrash their courses keep the occupants safe and maybe even remain comfortable and it's not nearly as simple as you might think throw on some rally tires and call it a day there's extensive work done to get these things to safely and reliably perform on a multitude of surfaces we'll start on the outside and work our way to the interior of course grip is the most critical component of any form of racing in rally top speeds generally aren't as high as what you'd see on a race track which means there's less reliance on aerodynamic grip and more reliance on mechanical grip coming down to the suspension and tires that's especially true for a stock sti the tires used are hoosier rally tires you'll notice the inside of the tire has wide rectangular blocks which help with traction and braking providing a wide surface to dig into and against the ground a fairly straight center section with grooves helps provide high speed stability and the outside of the tread sweeps outward to help clear gravel sand dirt or whatever surface the car is driving on finally there are large tread blocks on the outside which have aggressive edges to catch and grip up the car when it's sliding assisting with cornering thick rubber and reinforced sidewalls means a hefty heavy tire but they're well suited for abuse with far less of a chance for punctures than typical street tires from the tire we move to the 15 inch method wheels which are necessary since rally tires are sized at 15 inches why do these tires come in the 15 inch size well in rally the tire is an important part of your suspension you need to have enough sidewall to properly absorb impacts from the brutal nature of rally driving a thinner sidewall on larger wheels would mean more flats and more destroyed wheels but as a result of smaller wheels that restricts your brake caliper and rotor size the stock sti brakes are too big so dirt fish replaces them with stock 06 07 subaru wrx calipers for the front and rear hawk brake pads and downsized rotors this is nearly as large of a rotor and caliper combination that will fit the brake booster is also removed replaced with a new master cylinder providing a more consistent pedal feel along with custom brake lines for the rear brakes there's another important element added you'll see a wheel scraper located beneath the caliper this is made up of a metal insert for mounting and attached is a rubber scraper basically like a windshield wiper for your wheels that's rubbing the wheel at an angle and forcing out dirt and debris without this in place dirt enters the rear wheels and essentially sandblasts the rear calipers grinding down the outside of the caliper until the brake fluid inside is exposed at which point your brakes fail it's just like cutting a brake line dirtfish says without these scrapers the calipers might only last for about a month and the brake calipers aren't the only component in danger of damage from rocks and debris starting at the front and working our way back the front bumper has a fiberglass lip this is for people like me who continue to strike the front of the car on sticks and cones a quarter inch aluminum skid plate helps protect the engine and oil pan plastic fender liners are inserted protecting the car and also importantly the wiring harness hidden behind and there are mud flaps because sometimes these cars are driving in the mud they also have wide long pieces of underbody protection which are pretty interesting the material is high density polyethylene dirt fish tells me this is similar to a cutting board material essentially a strong durable plastic and that's great news because if during a rally stage you happen to flip over you can start preparing a meal without any trouble most of the underbody protection is fastened using welded nutserts on the chassis but the back of it is actually attached using zip ties this flexible mounting allows the plastic protection to move up and down with the rear suspension then at the end of the day simply snip the zip ties and you can power wash the rear suspension and get it prepped for the next day without this protection the rear drivetrain and rear suspension would get rashed out from all the dirt and rocks continually pummeling it the rear suspension uses universal adjustable bilstein chucks which are rebuildable and can handle the abuse up front our rebuildable ryger rally shocks covered in a protective sleeve to keep out dirt water and dust the vehicle's overall ride height is about 2 inches higher or about 7 inches of ground clearance with 6 inches of travel both more than stock with the modifications suspension travel is limited by the stock suspension bushings which can bind dirtfish says in the eight years they've used these riger suspensions they've never had to throw one away as they're serviceable and you can order the individual parts to rebuild them under the abuse of the dirt fish rally school i'm told a stock sti suspension can last anywhere from about a day yes a single day to about two months so all in all the front and rear suspension do-over allows for four major advantages more clearance more travel both of which help with grip significant reliability improvements which ultimately saves cost and it's actually a very nice riding vehicle i was pleasantly surprised to never find myself focusing on the harshness of the ride it's really well behaved regardless of what speeds i was traveling at and i didn't find my body in pain after three full days of driving i'm confident i wouldn't be able to say the same of the stock sdi suspension which is quite firm and offers less travel moving inward from the suspension it's a fairly stock setup for the powertrain before reaching the engine the transmission and differentials are stock without coolers and for the most part able to handle the abuse getting to the engine there are some significant revisions made the engine gets forged internals and sees new pistons rods bearings head studs and head gaskets the engine is also modified to make it easier to work on removing certain hoses and emissions equipment that aren't required for a private driving facility i'm told the biggest challenge with the engine is the air filter because they're constantly driving in dirty dusty conditions whatever ends up getting past the air filter well it ends up in the cylinders here it chews up the cylinder walls and i'm told eventually it will actually make the cylinders oval in shape leading to excessive blow-by and oil consumption as the oil control rings can no longer do their job following that exhaust there's an aftermarket downpipe which gets rid of the catalytic converters but as you go back the silencer and mufflers are all stuck that helps keep the neighbors happy inside the car it's also a fairly dramatic change most of the interior stripped out with a roll cage and bucket seats put in the roll cage is a bit of a unique design as it's not to meet any specific regulations in this case but it does improve safety with certain modifications to ensure it's still really easy to get in and out of the vehicle versus a full cage that will be used in racing the cable driven stock handbrake is replaced with a hydraulic hand brake once everything is complete inside and out they put on the exterior wrap which is designed cut and installed all in house as you can see turning the subaru sti into a better performing safe and super importantly reliable rally machine isn't quite as simple as throwing on some tires i will admit that when i participated in subaru's winter experience on a frozen lake it really is just a wheels and tire swap on a bone stock sti and you're off to have a good day which i most definitely did but that was on a smooth frozen lake out on a rally course with big bumps rough surfaces changing conditions and large impact forces in all kinds of different directions there really is a lot of effort required into transforming one of these machines into something that can crush a rally stage keep in mind a modern sti is coming from the factory with 4.9 inches of ground clearance with a stiff suspension that feels great on a track but is much less at home off-road the underpinnings start with a very solid all-wheel drive system but from there it's a lot of work so once you have the car set up right it's important to understand certain driving techniques that are quite useful in rally after three days of driving three distinct techniques stood out to me as being quite important to moving quickly in a rally stage first is the driving line in road racing you generally want your car to travel in as straight of a path as possible this usually means smoothing out curves to make wide arcs in rally you literally want the car pointing straight as much as you can a fairly similar technique to a late apex in road racing but with a lot more sliding essentially you're attempting to minimize time spent turning and maximize time spent accelerating this leads to the next two techniques which allow you to properly set up your line lift turn weight or brake and trail braking as the name implies lift turn weight simply refers to lifting off the throttle turning the wheel and waiting for the car to catch and rotate if you're not getting enough rotation applying the brakes can help transfer weight to the front of the car digging in those front tires and helping you turn in this will cause the car to slide a bit sideways straightening up with the path ahead and allowing for you to get onto the throttle as long as possible until your next turn i found lift turn brake the least intuitive because i tended to want to brake sooner but for low speed corners or corners with a lot of runoff space it can allow you to keep your vehicle speed higher through the corner mostly i found myself trail braking for the majority of corners this is a bit different than trail braking on track if you're used to that technique approaching a corner you initially brake hard in a straight line turn in to get the car to rotate and ease off the brake pressure as you get the car pointed straight ahead the big difference versus a road course is how the car behaves because once you brake hard you load up the front tires which then have a lot of grip and when you turn in the rear kicks out sliding the car and allowing you to point forward for your neck straight away with minimal steering input the difficult thing with all of this is timing you don't get immediate reactions like you do on tarmac so you have to predict how much grip you have and assess when you should start this process that was part of why i think i found trail braking more intuitive because when you hit the brakes you find out what your grip is and from there you adjust your turn in point and grip changes constantly whether the surface is wet dry how loose the surface is how many cars have gone over it every time you approach a corner it can be different to me that's what i found so challenging about this sport but it's also so rewarding because when you get it right it's an amazing feeling and with that note i want to provide a small taste of what the dirt fish experience is like which is fantastic that said mentally i found it overwhelming the first day part of that is having not really left my house much in the past year and part of it is that during rally driving there's a lot to think about and a lot of techniques they teach you over the three three-day course i attended the common stuff like the traction circle weight transfer and braking to the more rally focused techniques like lift turn weight lift turn brake trail braking left foot braking threshold braking the rally line using slides pendulum turns linking corners and shift timing there's a ton to think about with both traction and weather conditions constantly changing there's a beautiful middle ground between not thinking at all and thinking too much where everything starts to click and you start connecting your movements so to put it all together and again to provide a glimpse into what you get to do here at dirt fish here's one of my full laps from day three after being taught by my wonderful instructors eric kevin michelle jeff jack and kip get ready to witness great five count four three two one go for it or not stalled immediately let's try that again [Music] very nice smaller left three the just a left that should be good actually go for it off the tarmac gravel left four and right two left forward to right yeah there it is there it is right nice there we go arrow right once again so there you have it huge thank you to dirt fish for inviting me out and a big thanks to all of you for watching if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below
