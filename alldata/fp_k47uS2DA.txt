hello everyone I'm pleased to announce my new tour for 2024 beginning in early February and running through June Tammy and I an assortment of special guests are going to visit 51 cities in the US you can find out more information about this on my website jordanbpeterson.com as well as accessing all relevant ticketing information I'm going to use the tour to walk through some of the ideas I've been working on my forthcoming book out November 2024 we who wrestle with God I'm looking forward to this I'm thrilled to be able to do it again and I'll be pleased to see all of you again soon bye-bye in the US only 11 States produce more energy than they consume 39 States consume more than they produce Jordan and buy a lot and the big ones New York and California they're importing their energy well that's great as long as you can but ask Germany how that went when the Russian gas stopped it didn't go well we have to start to um conflate these things in what I lovingly call the radical middle and that middle is between energy the economy and the [Music] environment hello everyone I'm talking today with Dr Scott Tinker uh I met Scott at the art conference Alliance for responsible citizenship in London at the end of October where he gave a very well-received talk on the Nexus between energy energy and the environment and it's been the most popular talk on the ark website on YouTube um racking up about 1.2 million views as of today and so I felt for a variety of reasons that it would be worth delving into Scott's thought and his back ground in more detail I've had a number of people on the podcast who've talked about the energy environment relationship particularly as it pertains to climate which is obviously a determining element when you're plotting forward an energy strategy we talk a lot about the relationship between energy and the rectification of absolute privation there's a lot of people in the world are still living hand to mouth you might say and a huge part of the reason for that is that they don't have access to clean reliable plentiful inexpensive energy in whatever form and are reduced to doing things like burning dung or or wood if they're fortunate the problem with that is that poor people there's many problems with that but one of the problems is that poor people living hand to mouth don't take a long-term view of such niceties let's say as environmental sustainability which doesn't occupy the Forefront of your thinking if you're trying to figure out how to scr around in the dirt so your children don't starve like today and so there is evidence that working to eradicate absolute privation around the world with the provision of more inexpensive energy for example would simultaneously be the best possible Pathway to genuine environmental sustainability as when people become more wealthy or even a little bit wealthy they start thinking over a long term and are more concerned with the viability of the environment for example or even able to conceptualize such a thing and so we delve into that in great length trying to flesh out what a more multi-dimensional view of human flourishing and environmental sustainability might be so Scott the last time we saw each other was in London at the end of October and you did a speech there which has been extraordinarily well received um on the arc website Alliance for respons citizenship your speech on energy in the environment is the most popular speech now I think Constantine kissen probably has you in total views because his speech has been distributed in other locals and has kind of gone viral in multiple places but it was very interesting to me to see this happen because well that sort of thing isn't predictable I think there's probably 30 speeches up now and it wasn't obvious that it would be a talk on energy and environmental policy that would take the spotlight obviously you did something right I mean it's it's a very well done talk technically you know it's it's very accessible and you're very engaging and so that certainly didn't hurt but why do you think first of all what did you think of the art conference and also why do you think that your speech struck a court it's got about 1.2 million views as of today yeah yeah yeah that's good I like the art conference and I appreciate the invitation there really do I love the diversity of the audience representing Global thinkers that was nice and and the broad depth uh Jordan of the speakers themselves and the bread of the topics I didn't expect some of the things to be candid with you we we went from Faith and family all the way through to education and of course energy the environment and and and poetry and music it was phenomenal so congratulations to you and the baroness for putting together a really excellent excellent engagement I really enjoyed my time there so thanks for that yeah it was fun it was fun we figure we we we figure we missed one major area that I think we're going to rectify we didn't talk about virtual identity and I think we're going to add that as a category so that would include discussions of digital currency for example Etc and all the potential nightmares that come along with with that but it would also cover more broadly you know increasingly we have a virtual self and it isn't obvious at all what rights that virtual self has or even who owns it in some fundamental sense and that's actually a major problem and it's it's going to get much worse so well we'll Rectify that with the next conferences so why do you think what is it about your speech do you think that struck a court maybe you could outline first of all what you talked about but also provide some insight into why you know people have really taken it to heart yeah I just have a really big family and I made them all watch it yeah you must have a very big family look I've been speaking on these topics for three decades and and it's nice to see I think what's happening is some of the extremes on both sides are starting to come around toward that what I call the radical middle and and think about these things deeper than simply black and white or good and bad believer or denier kinds of dialogues that we have been pushed on us so I think that's striking a chord now people are that I've been hearing from from all over the world on that speech actually writing from every corner independently are saying thank you for your objectivity your balance for not trying to be you know flamboyant or shov an opinion down our throat thank you for the data and I do tend to show a lot of data in my talks but I I spend time with an anime made it so you can understand what that data is saying by the end of a particular slide or or theme if you will so a lot of people like the data uh young people at that conference by the way came up to me very much and very often and they said we so appreciate your tone not telling us what we should think or what to do but just offering this kind of setting if you will of the energy the environment and economy for us to think on and that that may be striking a chord now and I know you do that too I really really appreciate your efforts and others who were at that conference to to get us thinking and I'm I think it's just time to think so perhaps that's why it's striking a cord well you know one of the things we noticed because as I said we've released a fairly large number of speeches and of course the viewership follows a classic predo distribution with a small percentage of the videos taking up the vast majority of the views and one of the things that we noticed very significantly was that any speaker who politicized the issue got no views right so it was people who spoke two ways they either spoke on first principles so to they took a more philosophical rather than a political view and then more educational and so I think you you you probably tilted more towards the educational side although there was a philosophical aspect in your insistence that there are that you what we're always attempting to do is balance tradeoffs right and and there's a there's a philosophical notion there that there's no perfect solution and that many other competing Goods have to be taken into account when we're trekking through something as complex as the relationship between the energy and the environment which is an impossibly complex Nexus and so so it's so one of the things we've also learned although we kind of knew this beforehand but it's really been driven home is that when we invite speakers even if they're political figures we're going to first of all focus on political speakers who can speak from first principles and do something more educational and we're going to inform all our speakers that that's much more likely it's much more in keeping with the ark Enterprise and it's also much more likely to be successful there's a political figure in Canada Pierre POV who's now the leader of the conservative party in Canada and most likely to be the next prime minister and he's become a real expert user of social media and so he ran his leadership campaign for the conservative party completely outside the Legacy Media giving virtually no interviews he created all his own ads and he's done something very interesting in the last month he's produced two 17-minute documentaries one on housing and one on debt that they kind of look like PBS documentaries you know they have that flavor that back when PBS wasn't a political Enterprise they have that flavor and it it it seems to me I've also found on my podcast that more political speakers regardless of their Fame tend to attract disproportionately few views that's interesting so I think that people well I think people are really hungry for a different approach to problems and one that's in keeping with what you did which is like a serious discussion of the facts dispassionate presentation of the facts at hand understanding they have to be viewed through the Nexus of like a multi-dimensional value hierarchy trying to negotiate those not claiming that the experts know what pathway forward is best I and the problem with that view is that well just because you're an expert on energy doesn't mean you know how to balance energy expenditures with education absolutely and much less healthare and everything else that has to be taken into account so okay so let's go to your let's go to your background yeah quick comment before you before you go I speak in Canada a lot in fact I'll be in Toronto next week uh speaking to the National oh I'm there we should we should have dinner oh well I'm speaking to the national uh National Bank of Canada uh at their energy conference um and we're starting to see we're starting to see that what you just described is this this desire for more for more depth and I think that kind of sums it up well particularly this younger generation of people and I have a PBS talk show we're in recording our fifth season and you're right it's a little bit politically biased but it's still the most trusted Network in the US at least in terms of an attempt to be and we we very much do that on our show as well is look for the multiple viewpoints and and I've say this very often Jordan one owns the truth you know we just seek it particularly in science we scientists live a tortured life of always questioning everything over and over skepticism it's part of Science and and that's where I think I might have kicked off my speech I'm recalling now there in London following your lead there was a bunch on kind of religion and Faith early on I think day one and I I talked about that a little bit that you could Define faith much better than I can but you know it's it's a process in which maybe there's there's less doubt when in faith but science is filled with doubt with without doubt we have no science and I think I probably said there you take away doubt from science it becomes more of a religion and that is a very dangerous path to walk down I'll I'll comment a bit about the issue of faith and Science and uh then we'll turn to to to who you are so everybody's clued in about your expertise and and we'll talk more about energy and environment so been thinking this through a lot you know when a scientist confronts a data set he does so or she does so with a variety of AIMS in mind now one of the things I saw increasingly happen in the last decades that I was in Academia was that science became both politicized and subject to the demands of career now I'd seen this with with every graduate student for example there's always this terrible tension between going into the data set with an orientation towards the truth and going into the data set knowing full well that if you don't extract out from the numbers a publishable uh statement that all of your efforts are have been in vain and your careers on the line and you know that whenever you're doing statistical analysis when you're conducting scientific inquiry you're always balancing that demand to falsify your own cherished Notions even those upon which your reputation are based and to demonstrate to yourself that your current experiment was a failure with the opportunity and requirement to follow the truth and so what I would say constitutes the proper place of faith in science and I actually think this is the right way to think about it metaphysically is that you have to confront the data set with the presumption that there is nothing better that could happen to you than to find out what it actually represents regardless of the apparent cost to short-term or even medium-term cost to your career and even more than that to believe that in the long run medium to long run if you actually pursue the truth in your statistical analysis even though you may pay a short-term price in disruption of your pet theories and you know the failure of the odd experiment your career is going to be much more reliable and much broader and deeper as it iterates across time that's called learning we learn from our failures right not from our successes well and it's also predicated on the assumption that that learning is possible that the universe is rational and that if you learn from your mistakes that the consequence of that will be better for everyone and those are the axioms of faith I think that are part and parcel of the scientific process not belief in the overall validity of a given set of facts which is more like a totalitarianism yeah yeah no that's very that's very interesting and I think wellp put um it's the challenge academics face and I have been one for 23 24 years now out of the industry for 17 is is the push push push as you describe to get your research published and journals are want to publish failures they want to publish things that move the science forward some kind of a learning or success if you will and it's unfortunate because everyone would learn much more if we were to publish the experimental designs we set up and the failures in those and and I think as a result of that we've stopped asking as many why questions we see a lot of how what where when which is interesting they're interesting ing questions but why is the toughest question of all why in in life you know individual as well as scientific why and that's really the great challenge because you can only typically prove things that don't answer why not things that are the answer if you will you knock down the possibilities that don't address the data set as you've described it and that's very powerful as you go down that road but it takes a long time and I would like to see us come back to to publishing more of the failed experiments if you will I think we would all learn greatly from that yeah well there's obviously it's obviously time for a technical revolution in scientific publication because the whole process has become it's absurd the fact that it takes two years to publish something is just you know it's just completely it's given how easy it is to publish it's just beyond comprehension the fact that all that scientific research that's taxpayer funded is locked behind to pay wall the fact that the publishing companies have a hammer lock on Library Acquisitions and that the libraries are what would you say Duty bound to subsidize the Publishers like the whole thing is just it's just a mess I can see substack headed in a way that would allow for rigorous science to be published and and absolutely and wouldn't that be neat I mean we talk about peer review well you put your science out there to the world and there's plenty of peer review we hear back all the time well you know we been we've been thinking about doing that technically too I mean one of the things that should happen as well you could imagine imagine a site where you could publish your paper in the same format that they're published now a page summary for lay audience you can identify your four peer reviewers they publish their reviews on the paper site they can take authorship of that which would could be another CV component because it wouldn't it be lovely for people to get some credit especially beginning scientists for their peerreview work which is actual real work if you do it properly and then so and that could be done with some degree of rapidity and then it it's up to the marketplace to sort the papers in terms of how much attention they attract but that's also how it works in the scientific publishing Enterprise anyways and that could all be open access absolutely I just can't see why that like that's right in front of us and it it at some point it's going to happen and it takes peer review Out of the Shadows yes exactly exactly so yeah so I suspect that we're very much we're very serious about engaging in an Enterprise like that excellent you know it depends where it is in the priority stream but yes that would be very nice so you have to do yeah yeah yeah yeah right right exactly although it's so important because it really it it really it really has become a problem and and it and that that that fact that we've we only publish successes when that's the wrong way to describe success like if you happen to stumble across a a more profound truth because you set up your experiment properly well more power to you but if you set it up extremely well and tested something of extreme interest and it doesn't work out there's absolutely no reason people shouldn't know about that not least so they don't do the same thing like multiple times right so yeah you ask a ha question and you have a hypothesis about that question to test and throughout that process whatever it may be your hypothesis may be proven wrong and we need to be able to show that that's why we do science we're not all perfect hypothesizes no no no not L we're playing fast and loose with the data yeah that's for sure so we shouldn't be punishing the people who follow the pathway of Truth so so tell us tell everybody a little bit about your background you've been dealing in in in in the overlap space between energy and the environment for decades so what what are your why are you qualified to do that how did that interest develop well I'm actually a geologist by training and have degrees in that um my PhD uh from the University of Colorado master from University of Michigan and undergrad and degrees in business as well so I've always been interested in that overlap space because economics drives so many things and the environment is a natural piece for geologists to think about I've spent many nights in a tent in many places in the world in the field we geologists go into the field a lot and been fortunate to visit over 60 countries deeply inside of them from the the poorest amongst us and I mean literally step on a human being without limbs in the dirt pour to probably some of the wealthiest Among Us and and seen all of that Jordan and I'm still only a fraction of it but it's uh it's very powerful I learn by uh that by sensing things I people say describe India I said you can smell India you know you can taste India it's you can't you can't those those are you can't unsell or un taste' been there particularly in the impoverished regions and sure you see it and hear it the noise is incredible but it it just wakens up all the senses so that's as a geologist um we are problem solvers we deal with lots of imperfect data and incomplete data I particularly study that have studied the subsurface which means you only get very small samples of things and you have to do interpolation and extrapolation in modeling and data analysis and knowing that your answer isn't right you're just trying to constrain it around what the data tell you and and then adapt and change as you go so that's my background as a scientist uh and a business person I happen to have built and well not built but over the last 24 years from 90 people to over 250 people the largest research organization at UT Austin other than a Navy funded one and we do energy environmental and economic research all over the world and half of our 250 person staff is are international not us born at least and so very diverse and fun yesterday was my last day as director uh after 24 years I fired myself so you know at 64 years old it's time to let other folks have that fun and and I've got plenty to do into the future and hopefully some things with you so that's kind of my background uh filmmaker um I host a PBS show I do radio broadcasts and lots of speaking around the world and have Through The Years got a wonderful family a wife of 40 years now now and four kids all grown and gone and they're all data scientists and and so they just keep teaching me how little I know and aren't they right so anyway that's that's a little bit of my background the 40 days leading up to Easter lent starts on Ash Wednesday that's

of all 10,000 plus prayers and meditations all right so let me ask you given that background let me ask you some questions so I've been trying to understand the energy environment business Nexus for about three decades I would say and trying to use my experience in assessing scientific literature and reading scientific papers to get a sense of the situation and so I have a I have a provocative question maybe to begin with so I came across the data let me step one step back my understanding initially was the idea that global warming such as it is was going to produce an expansion of the world's deserts and make the our sphere more Aid and uninhabitable and instead what I've seen since the year 2000 in particular is the rapid Greening of a very large geographical area which I believe NASA has now estimated at twice the size of the continental US three times the size of the Amazon jungle has greened since the year 2000 and along with and the reason for that is that carbon dioxide levels have gone up and what that means is that although there's been a certain arguable degree of heating so to speak because of that it's made it easier for plants to breathe and when they can breathe easier their breathing pores shrink in size because they don't have to expose themselves to so much surface area and because of that they can conserve water much more efficiently and because of that they can grow in areas that would have otherwise be too AIT and because of that we're seeing a tremendous amount of Greening not in places where there was already plenty of water let's say but in semi-arid areas so that the the deserts like the Sahara particularly in the South are now shrinking and so part of me thinks when I look at the data from a bird's eye view let's say that the most striking ecological fact of the last 20 years is the radical increase in Green Space on the Earth's surface now that ALS also accompanies something like a 10 to 15% increase in crop productivity which is also a major piece of data right and that that's also a consequence of carbon dioxide increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and then I add to that other data that I've seen that shows that by long-term historical standards so over periods of millions of years or tens of millions of years the atmosphere of the world is actually very devoid of carbon dioxide and so although there's more than there was 200 years ago there have been periods of time where the planet was a lot Greener and a lot Lusher where there was way more carbon dioxide in the air and that seemed to be pretty damn good for plants so I look at all that and I think okay so if there was no political nonsense around this and we were just analyzing the data as of today why wouldn't we conclude that carbon dioxide increase as a consequence of fossil fuel consumption is a net good yeah no this is this is uh an interesting dialogue I think you laid it out well uh I said in Joe mansion's Senate hearing about two two and a half years ago now it's important it was his one of his big climate hearings faty baral was there and a couple other folks just four of us and I said it's important to be both completely factual and factually complete and factually complete is hard Jord as you know we none of us can do it it's just there's too much now we can be completely factual we can all have facts and they're as well presented and known as we can we're not trying to mislead necessarily or maybe we are but but factual completeness is difficult so you're what you outlined there I let me try to address on a couple levels as succinctly as I can one is a geologist um very true there have been levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere spere that exceed today's by 20 times okay 78,000 parts per million not 420 okay when well back in what we call the Mesozoic this is when the dinosaurs roamed the Earth uh the CR you know the jur the Triassic Jurassic and the Cretaceous periods in that era plants were huge leaves on plants were enormous animals were large obviously there dinosaurs were around there were small ones as well the Earth was pretty healthy it was warmer okay it was really truly What's called the greenhouse time and I'm not talking about we could talk about these if you wish you know the the glacial interglacial cycles that are about 100,000 years long that we deal with now and minkovich described very well I'm talking about tens to hundreds of millions of year Cycles Greenhouse Ice House Greenhouse times when the Earth Earth has been devoid of ice for the most part and covered in ice as a snowball Earth so the Mesozoic was one of those times when it was high CO2 very warm and very healthy now those creatures plants and animals had had time to adapt to that they had come out of one of the largest extinctions on Earth at the end of the Paleozoic at the End of perian Time 70% of species are more went extinct so this was a and we we Define the time by that Extinction actually the bi ology the paleontology defines that not the other way around so they they came into a new sense and flourished and that ended and and by the way time is such a hard concept let me just give you a feeling for it this way since we're talking about dinosaurs often you'll see in a diarama in some Museum a T-Rex having a battle with a a Stegosaurus right well it turns out stegosaurus had gone extinct long before T-Rex came about in fact there's more time between the stegosaurus and the T-Rex than the T-Rex and us so process that to give you a feel for time okay and and so now a big impact event happened at the end of the Cretaceous uh big meteor impact in chickaloo in the Mexican Yucatan Peninsula and the Alvarez father son Duo described that very well it put out an aridium anomaly around the world that we measure at the end of the Cretaceous and could see and very I remember being grad school at the University of Michigan at that time the early ' 80s and they and they came to speak and we were all so smart we grad students we had t-shirts made that showed a incoming meteor and dinosaurs looking up saying oh you know and and we thought a meteor killed the dinosaurs right well that was right you know it had the Fallout from that and we didn't as grad students we didn't know much did we in fact I didn't even learn about plate tectonics an undergraduate that's how far back I go so we are always learning so the point here is yes there have been long cycles of changes in greenhouse gases CO2 being one of those gases methane and others as well if you come into the more nearer term not to today yet but let's say the last 5 million years we've seen about 50 glacial interglacial cycles and they're pretty well documented okay in the last million years 10 of those and what I mean by that is over every 100,000 years or so ice comes down from the north Canada is completely under ice and parts of the northern us Wisconsin Michigan parts of New York City very well documented under ice and I don't mean a little ice a thousand to 2,000 ft up to a mile of ice for 80,000 years and then for about 20,000 years it warms and the ice recedes and we have an interglacial period like the one we're living in now and so during that interglacial period and it started about 18,000 years ago we see the ice melt which means sea level starts to rise and and I'm talking about rates like the movies you know the Gulf of Mexico here in Texas was over 300 feet lower than it is today just 20,000 years ago and it started to rise 1 to two cmet a year almost an inch a year vertical this is very rapid rise and flooded the coastal plane of Texas and then about 7,000 years ago that leveled up and it's been rising about 1 to 2 millimet a year ever since in the last 7,000 years so you've studied and seen from the Stone Age to the Bronze Age to Enlightenment you all the way through to what we call the industrial revolution of this past Century uh in that time frame humans modern humans have evolved in that last interglacial period period and yes you are exactly right it is one of the lowest CO2 periods in Earth history and it's one of the coolest periods in Earth history I'm not talking about the actual interglacial because it's warmer than it was 80,2 80,2 but overall that periodicity of interglacial is one of the coolest periods in Earth history that we are enjoying today and a guy named milankovich worked all this out while on House of rest for 20 years on paper we call them milankovich cycles and we understand why it's a it's a combination of the rotational orbit of the Earth around the Sun and that varies so it puts you closer and farther from the Sun and then the the tilt of our Earth's access and the rotation of the AIS combined to form these 20 40 and 100,000 year Cycles embedded cycles and we see this repeated over and over that's driving modern climate today and it's driving historical climate in what we would consider the the recent past geologically now superimpose on that let's come into the today in the last 100 years we have been burning fossil fuels more than that actually we started with coal of course in the 1800s it powered our ships and trains uh it replaced wood and hay the carbon based fuels that we lived on for thousands and thousands of years to make our fires and to cook our food and to power our vehicles oxen and horses hay let's just call it hay you know stuff we grew and then Along Comes coal and we discover that hey nature did that it made it really Compact and dense so it's it's almost pure carbon now there are a lot of things in it that aren't good when you burn it for the air the actual pollutants if you will socks knocks Mercury particulate matter Etc that come when you burn coal so but that was a great fuel it allowed us to do things we' never done before including boil water make Steam turn a turbine and run a generator and make electricity and that changed the world that's the event in time that became that made us modern societies at least as you said those of us who are fortunate enough to have that many still don't more don't than do and we can talk all about that made films about that so um so here we are and we've been burning coal and then a long so that's carbon and then Along come hydrocarbons which are complex carbon and hydrogen molecules complex chains long chains and those burn even better especially when we refine them and make them into gasoline and Diesel and jet fuel and that's great we can put that into a vehicle now it's very dense I'm happy to talk about why dense matters but you get a lot of bang for the buck you put 20 gallons of gasoline in a tank and the impact of that in energetic terms is remarkable okay I can drive two three 400 miles on that tank of gasoline and there's no nothing left except CO2 emissions and you just fill it up in three minutes and go do it again it's incredible okay now it has the CO2 emissions component to it uh Along Comes methane CH4 for hydrogen's for every carbon now methane natural gas is what we call that and there are other gases that are natural Bane pentane whatever but methane is the one we use a lot of it's even more incredible the energy density of methane is phenomenal you're burning the hydrogen as well as the carbon so we get heat from that it's a very versal fuel I can make electricity by burning methane boiling water steam turbine generator I can put it directly into vehicles in a compressed form compressed natural gas I can use it as a molecule to make things like Plastics or ammonia for fertilizers you mentioned Agriculture and those fertilizers again Chang the world so that all is natural gas uh plastics it's it's it's it's it's one of the most versatile molecules we have today and it will be around a very long time produces less CO2 when you burn it than than oil or coal but it still produces CO2 and methane itself is a greenhouse gas pretty potent one doesn't last as long in the atmosphere but it's pretty intense more intense than CO2 in the atmosphere so these as you said are very complicated but we've moved out of this carbon economy into a hydrocarbon economy and now we're truly coming into a methane economy in that economy it won't be a few more years before we are using actually burning more methane than coal in the world globally not just modern societies but as a world and that's the methane economy it will have arrived and good thing because it does so many positive things for Humanity and human flourishing and also Less in terms of its environmental impact it doesn't have the sulfur and the nitrogen than the particulat good thing we've gone there and then from methane we can make hydrogen you know and and methane is the best molecule to make hydrogen so you've heard about a hydrogen economy your listeners probably have hydrogen didn't form naturally very much it is in places but you got to make it you got to split molecules either a water molecule H2O or methane CH4 the two common ones that takes energy less energy to split methane than water so energetically it's and economically it's better to use methane as a source of hydrogen and will be often the hydrogen economy at some in some phase and you can use hydrogen for a fuel and you can use it as an electricity carrier and all sorts of other things so this has been a really nice natural transition that's been happening driven by efficiency in physics and those when when those happen the economics are good and so the markets adapt them and they grow and that's what drives progress at the end of the day that's a long narrative but uh well there's three themes I want to pick up on in that one is Cycles one is time frame and one is progress sure we can Define all those so so let me continue with my doubts let's say so if we're trying see the first problem I have when I look at the analysis of climate Doom prediction is the problem that you alluded to with regards to time frame it's like well is there too much carbon dioxide in the air and is that a danger and the answer to that is well it depends on when you compare it to and that isn't just something you can brush off to the side because it's very if the starting point you choose for your analysis of increase or decrease determines whether you see an increase or decrease the gerain question is well what starting point do you pick and if the answer is well if you want to demonstrate an increase for political purposes you pick this starting point and if you want to demonstrate a decrease for political purposes you pick this starting point and you don't have a different criteria then the question itself starts to become incomprehensible because there's no such thing as the question is there more carbon dioxide now in the atmosphere there's only the question is there more carbon dioxide now in the atmosphere compared to then and then is arbitrary so I have no idea as a data scientist how to solve that problem especially in the light of the other things we discussed like you said well the planet is cooler than it has been according to many historical comparisons and more people die from cold than Heat by a lot and so if you're measure for what constitutes relevance is effect on humans cool isn't to be preferred to warm now there's obviously extremes over which that isn't true at all but as a rule of thumb the mere fact that things are getting warmer isn't in in of itself an indication of catastrophe and Nei let me clarify too on the cool part just so nobody goes it was colder in the glacial period for 80,000 years we're in a warm now but in this in this one to five million glacial interg glacial the whole package if you will is cooler than much of Earth history in the past in fact most of Earth history in the past just to clarify on that okay okay so so let me add another wrinkle and tell me what you think about this so when I first started to study the sorts of things that we're describing now um I was also curious about the relationship between economic development and environmental Consciousness let's say that would be attitudes and actions that are associated with some concern about the medium to long-term viability of the environment and one of the things I discovered very quickly which I think is just an economic truism as far as I can tell is that if you're so damn poverty-stricken that your fundamental concern is whether or not you're going to have lunch for your children then you're the probability that you're going to spend a second thinking about the medium to long-term viability of the general environment is zero and so one of the things you see reliably in economic analysis is that if you can get people up above $5,000 per year in GDP production then they start to take a medium to long-term view of environmental sustainability and we could Define sustainability perhaps as something like their concern that the planetory resources that they hypothetically enjoy now are likely to be there for their children their grandchildren and perhaps even their great-grandchildren so the time the time frame starts to expand and so the rule is something like with increased luxury let's say or even enough food which isn't exactly a luxury your time frame of analysis expands and if you are actually concerned about transforming human beings into a species that optimized its medium to long-term commitment ments it looked to me like there's nothing you could do that would be more effective in that aim than making sure that the bottom two billion people aren't scrabbling around in the dirt so desperately that they're willing to burn tomorrow to ensure survival today and then that there's a corollary to that which is okay that means that absolute privation is perhaps the fundamental environmental concern if this if this psychology of long-term view is correct and the fastest way to make poor people rich or to get the hell out of their way while they're trying to do it themselves is to provide inexpensive energy which because there's no in my sense of the world there's no difference between energy cost and wealth since energy is work and work does everything that's productive by definition if you lower the cost of energy you lower the cost of work and that makes people Rich so so I would like you to tell me if you think there's anything wrong with that reasoning and then maybe we could also have a discussion about progress on the energy front what would it mean to okay so let's do that yeah when we made our first featur link documentary film on energy called switch we filmed that in 2009 10 and post and 11 released it in 2012 and we went to 11 countries and showed you each form of energy where it was best in the world so we weren't trying to make something look bad or good we absolutely did the tradeoffs of the pros and cons of each form in that film however and it got picked up by academic campuses and it's still shown around 50 countries kind of as the First Energy quote transition film we show we weren't really transitioning so energy is Modern Life there's zero doubt about it turns out energy is all life even the poorest Among Us need energy to survive a few years went by and I said to our director hey we kind of left out Harry Lynch by the way brilliant filmmaker we left out more than half the world those who don't have these things so we met we we made a second featurelength film we filmed in 18 and 19 and post released it right at the beginning of Co and 20 and that was on energy poverty we went to six different countries and we looked at the circumstances in which people are living in Ethiopia and Kenia and Nepal and Vietnam and Colombia different continents and and again some of the positive stories around that Jordan uh that you are describing but some other real challenges as well what happens when you don't have energy and you can't get above that $5,000 personal wealth what's the name of that film it's called switch on switch on okay so there's switch and switch on yes yeah and it was a very powerful film a very different style I'm your on screen guide and and we take you in and spend time in these different areas and what you see and and it came to light on us is you can't Aid is interesting you people take aid and intentions are always good and here here's some Aid to go do this thing it turns out that thing be it a pump for water a solar panel for a little bit of electricity maybe a Light Bulb Etc um it doesn't work unless the community wants it they themselves have asked for it and they will then take it into the cultural situation in which they will benefit from it and we saw this over and over and over again it becomes something that is sustainable it survives it becomes a virtuous cycle of growth I'll give you some a few quick examples um you know a a a an induction cooktop in Nepal selling them on the Street Markets now they're very expensive but it changes cooking indoors with wood and the and we take you into the SEI Memorial Hospital there and we watch kids and mothers die you know more die every year from breathing indoor particulates by cooking indoors and Co killed in 2021 3 million a year it's just it's nuts and um another example is hair salons in Bangladesh where the women when they first got electricity they used it for hair salons and hair salons who would have thought well culturally it's a safe place for women to gather they share stories hair is is a piece of culture the money they get they invest back in the community at three times the men and so all of a sudden we have a virtuous cycle we take you to Kenya and look at pumps for water to grow agriculture Farmer John so his backyard is now growing crops at more than he needs so he can sell them into the marketplace and now that creates an economy a micro economy around which growth begins to happen his choice is need culturally not what we go tell people to do and we the rich World why say we call it what you wish you know I've heard Global North not my favorite term I've heard whatever you want to call it but those who have colonialists yes those who have more okay and and so yes energy is fundamentally vital for that and affordable energy uh and then moving into reliable energy and then eventually I don't like the word clean it's kind of meaningless to me but energy that has lower environmental impacts but you're exactly right I'm not going to worry about that environmental impact if I'm trying to eat or my kids aren't in a school etc etc I'm going to worry about basically you know go back to maof you know my hierarchy of need I have to have these fundamental things first in order just to survive and everything else becomes a luxury that I'm not going to indulge in so that's what we see we we the world needs to come out of energy poverty it needs to come out of economic poverty so that we can all begin to there will always be disparity in wealth but we can all begin to function at basic what we would consider basic human levels now and that's why we made that film and that's why I'm so passionate about this dialogue I I absolutely think that global leaders all of them every single time Jordan energy security Trump's climate security every single time look at the action not the words look at the action look what Germany has done look what China is doing look what we've done even in Canada where Mr Trudeau has some pretty you know hey words but look what you do you don't sacrifice your energy security or at least you haven't now we're starting to see not so far not so far and we're seeing circumstances even in the US now in California and in New York and other places where they're starting to get toward the edge of sacrificing energy security and wow get ready as that starts to happen we've already seen it happen in Western Europe we could talk all about the countries that are doing that well let's well let's talk well let's do that that so so we could do two things in parallel here so one would be we we touched on the idea of progress and so we have a working definition of progress that's kind of risen out of the convers ation and so one of the things we could say is that if our goal is the alleviation of misery and the sustainable alleviation of misery then one pathway towards that is to provide lowcost energy to the ABS to those in absolute privation working on the hypothesis that first of all that's obviously a good thing to do if you think that uncessary suffering is you know is is something to be dealt with but also if you're fundamental concern is sustainability even over human flourishing which I think is a mistake but anyways even if it is the data that indicate that people who have a certain degree of security can take a longer term view seems crystal clear so to me it's a mystery why this is actually an issue you know because once you know that you think well obviously then you make a hierarchy of energy sources and you find out what's inexpensive and you calculate the trade offs in relationship to even potentially carbon dioxide production but there's sort of a pathway and I'd like your opinion on that so you know dung Isn't So Good Wood is better than dung coal is better than wood natural gas is better than coal you know better it's denser but you can move along that yeah okay so so what so how do you see progression in the marketplace with regards to the alleviation of absolute privation what's the logical steps to undertake globally and and then how is that being violated let's say in places like Germany sure yeah and not to be too sanguin about it but in the end physics wins yeah dense wins now what do I mean by dense U the bang for the buck on a per unit weight or per unit volume or even a per unit area that's called surface power density um where do you get more energy for your buck if you will and so if I can do more I used gasoline is an example of dense but let me throw a curveball my my tank of gasoline will drive me 300 miles okay well the energy equivalent of one little uranium pellet that I stuff into a fuel rod in a nuclear reactor one pellet centimeter High half a centimeter wide the energy equivalent would drive me from New York to Los Angeles and back to Dallas one pellet that's dense energy compared to gasoline which is very dense compared to lots of other things that aren't dense the Sun the wind Hydro biofuels things that take a lot of land to do so physics wins in the end and we need to allow physics to win I am not a person who thinks that it's either the economy or the environment Jordan I just don't believe that I don't think that the data lead is there I think we in this sense can have both but we can't have all of both okay and there's the tradeoff space if I want 100% zero CO2 emissions well I don't get energy security and I don't get Economic Security I get very little of that okay I got to bring that why would you want well why would you want 100% this is the thing I don't quite get I mean let's assume that there are people who are willing to make that tradeoff their their goal is like Net Zero carbon dioxide admission or even reversing it it's like okay your point is we're going to pay a major price for that and the Wii isn't going to be you and me the Wii is going to be the world's poor wherever they happen to be and they're going to get walloped like devastated by it what's the old line when the work when the when the uh when the aristocrats catch a cold the working class dies of pneumonia well it's always the case if if 5% of the world's population is barely hovering on the edge of viability ility and you double their energy costs they all die yeah it turns out this is not good so it turns out 60% of us live in some level of energy poverty today I'm going to say that again 60% 5 billion out of 8.2 and and and I say some level they're not in abject energy poverty and economic poverty not the bottom billion that's come up after Co unfortunately we were doing great but it's that next level where energy is not secure to them it comes and goes unpredictably the electricity is maybe on an hour or two a day my fuel price is volatile and I don't have it sometimes so we don't understand these things these are so-called electrified energized economies but it's not what you and I have nothing close right okay so this is which is something that works all the time all the time affordably yes yes and that's very hard to achieve but the 99% absolutely is is is is what we strive for so I think you've kind of brought us back around to the question I never answered about Greening so I'll just chime in on that yes the Earth is Greening you can see it from space uh CO2 is a is a food you described it well we have to be a little cautious there some of that growth is not plants that are the kind that we would expect in those environments and they're not very diverse so you get a lot of aggressive growth sometimes of Exotics things that have come in including in the reefs the Great Barrier Reef has growth but it's a few species not the healthy diversity of species that we see so we got to be a little cautious this is back to the completely factual and factually complete on describing what that looks like and whether it's kind of a Healthy Growth if you will a very important Point um but nonetheless yes the world isn't baking in the Sierra the Sahara Desert hasn't gone you know crazy in that sense either um but I I I come back to kind of that that trajectory of energy then fortunately and fortunately we we can address the emissions with dense energy okay it's maybe we're lucky maybe it's not a coincidence but methane CH4 uh hydrogen um nuclear uranium and thorium being used as a heat source to boil water make Steam turn a turbine run a generator that's fion the fusion side of the equation which is getting closer I used to smile but it's getting closer and I'm not a nuclear physicist those are things that have zero to no emissions and they're very dense and the Technologies are ever better and so there's a solution staring Us in the face here it's not necessarily the one that climate scientists and climate well just the climate impassioned um not because a lot of climate scientists are wonderfully deep thinkers and great scientists they leave the realm a little bit as they start to talk about energy just like I leave my realm if I get into deep climate modeling so we have to allow the scientific space for those who have the most expertise to help us move forward in in entic terms to address emissions and human flourishing and it can be done well we we should make a stronger statement than that there is no bloody way we're going to move to environmental sustainability on the backs of the poor because they won't have it if we produce enough economic Havoc which we could easily do then we'll produce a deterioration back to very short-term thinking and will produce an environmental nightmare so it isn't can we have human flourishing or zero impact on the planet it's that if we put the poor under too much stress which is first of all is an absolutely unconscionable thing for rich people to be doing but if it does there's going to be a kickback the likes of which we can hardly imagine yeah let them eat cake well guess who ate cake right off with or zoo animals right right cuz if you make a you know if you take a given country and you destroy the economy you're going to destroy all the animal because as soon as people get hungry enough they're going to eat everything so we have to manage human beings so to speak we we have to allow human beings to step up the energy density ladder so that they can address their absolute privation so they can take a longer term View and there's no environmental solution absent of that as far as I can tell right there's a there's an interesting we've talked about energy the economy and the environment there's another e that's really important here one of efficiency and let me let me just briefly describe that and how I think about efficiency in the United States we use about a 100 quadrillion BTUs of energy every year 100 quads what does that mean to anybody nothing that's interestingly enough it's about a quadrillion BTU is about the same as an exle term physicist love that means nothing it's about the same as as a trillion cubic feet of natural gas maybe we're getting a little closer into the space people start to understand it's a lot of energy 100 quads it come primary energy comes into our system we use it for residential commercial industrial and transportation reasons that's how we use energy heat and cool things and move ourselves around okay the 100 quads comes in Jordan guess what only onethird of that does useful work twoth thirds of that is wasted mostly is heat and other things it doesn't do anything useful so we have a lot of low hanging fruit in that space even if we could go to 50% does useful work think of that that adds another 17 quads of energy without adding any more Primary in so it's there's an incredible opportunity here as the world begins to lift itself from poverty and the modern world continues to stay healthy to do more with less I'm not changing my lifestyle and those who need to change your lifestyle can but we can all do more with less we can become a lot more efficient and how we use energy and that's how we ended our very first film when you end a film it's with the last thing you want them to remember was on just personal efficiency things it's not it's not rocket science these are simple things we can all do and I'm not saying you know go to austerity measures and turn off your heating in the winter time not at all quite the opposite just simple things we can all do and so that's a very important piece of this overall equation and I think the opportunity to waste less as the world begins to modernize is there it's ripe for the taking that's one of the things we the modern societies can can transport to evolving developing and developed and and and emerging economies is is efficiency as they gain energy yeah well it it makes sense to me that as the developing countries develop they're going to start with technologies that to some degree we have superseded right so you see this for example with China's hyper Reliance on cheap coal and some of which is provided by the Australia that won't burn coal themselves now I know coal produces a fair bit of particulate matter but it doesn't really matter where the carbon dioxide is produced because it turns out that we all share the same atmosphere so the Chinese and the Indians in particular and those are the most populous countries and the same thing is going to happen in Nigeria at some point because it's going to be the world's most populous country by the year 2100 they're going to step up the energy density La ladder and it it would make a certain amount of sense that the developed countries I mean China can obviously do this to some degree by themselves are going to turn increasingly to sources of extremely high density like nuclear sources but then I see these weird inversions where countries like Germany and States like California have decided Well the next right thing to do in the progression towards a sustainable economy is to shut down the nuclear reactors and so and then in well in Germany they burn H they burn legite coal which is high particulate high carbon dioxide as a consequence at least a partial consequence of shutting down their nuclear reactors and so when I see that I think well what the hell is going on like there is no standpoint from which that makes sense so no there is what are the impediments what do you think like what's the proper pathway forward in your estimation and what are the impediments to that at the moment boy there's a lot here to unpack I'll try to be brief we have lignite in Texas we call it black dirt you know it's it's hardly coal it's not anthracite by any means or other forms of coal so Germany is has that they increased their coal production 133% when they set down their nuclear reactors and climate scientists were a gast and they should be that was crazy okay there's a cultural component to Germany's fear or adversion to nuclear power I don't fully understand it France on the other hand about the same size Etc has a nuclear Fleet they needed it so they didn't have options so they built their nuclear Fleet it doesn't make sense you can't make um logical sense of that that's a cultural human thing in Germany and other parts of the world they're going to change you're starting to see it maybe they'll evolve it with small Maja reactors which they'll think is different but it's not it's the same technology it's fishion whether they're you know light water reactors or sodium cool whatever pick your favorite it's still Vision um but that's fine you know if that's what it takes to help mitigate some of that fear great um you see China building they're the China and Russia are building 75% of the world's reactor nuclear reactors today just those two countries and they have a lot more on the books China gets it now they're also growing everything else rapidly and this is where that completely factual fact complete comes back in you will hear completely factual China is the leader in solar and wind in the world they have more than any other country true you scale it all down and it's still a trivial part of their total energy consumption it's just a few percent of the power alone electricity alone and electricity is only 20 to 25% of total energy so this is the scale challenge Jordan China has to have at all and they are going toward dents uh China's energy alone China's annual energy consumption alone just that country is more than all the electricity consumed in the world combined all the electricity in the world okay so that's a scale challenge we just have to start to understand the scale you said it very well India and China combined are one out of every three people on the planet today one out of three now getting a little population demography um China's birth rates are some fertility rates are some of the lowest in the world at 1.2 India is now at 2.1 which is the replacement rate India has come down to 2.1 who knew I didn't there's a great right demographer shock a shock yes and a UT Austin guy and what's been happening since the last 30 years if picture this graph I'm a data guy you know the bottom is GDP per capita and this axis is fertility rates okay I was looking at those the other day it's incredible every large country in the world over a million people over since in the last 30 years the fertility rates are just plummeting all of them and they're moving toward wealth they're not wealthy they're moving toward wealth and so this is a remarkable Trend underpinned by energy now there are a lot of people very concerned about this including China we this gets philosophical we Define growth as good if you're not growing you're dying what's China's not growing in population anymore and they don't they don't bring people in like we do in our countries you so they're rolled they're seeing their population do this and how are they going to continue to grow and how's the world going to grow what we see in those studies is around 2080 that's not very far away the world Peaks at 10 billion people from our 8.2 today and it doesn't it doesn't Plateau it plummets back down right it plummets well so well so you've added another interesting and counterproductive observation so even well well even if even if you were concerned about human impact yes let's say if that was your primary concern was human impact on the biosphere no matter how that was measured your logical steps forward would be to make the poor Rich as fast as possible not least because that is by far the most effective method of population control we've ever invented as you pointed out it's absolutely staggering in some countries yeah step one yes well and and and so now I would say as you've already intimated that the fact that fertility rates have declined so precipitously is going to become a problem in and of itself but we can leave that aside we can especially leave leave that aside if we're concerned about human impact on the planet because we would recognize that as a net good so even if you're one of these people who you know derived from the club of Rome think there are far too many people on the planet the obvious cure for that is to make everybody Rich because they stop having babies so it's another reason that I can't like I can't understand the pervasive nature of the insistence for example that we have to de-industrialized to serve the planet's interests most appropriately and then we can look at practical examples like Germany where this is starting to be implemented and all the consequences appear to be negative including the fact so Germany and I think I have these figures about right energy is now five times as expensive in Germany as it needs to be but it's also far dirtier it's more unreliable and it's more dependent on dictators to provide like who in whose interest even hypothetical is any of that it isn't serving the green agenda in the least quite the contrary so well maybe it's in the interest of you use the word dictators autocrats yeah maybe well short term okay it keeps me elected yeah well it seems to it seems to be keeping people elected in people like places like Germany of course all the farmers are having a short circuit in Germany at the moment and that didn't go so well for the Dutch authorities obviously yellow vests in France you had the truckers in Canada I mean the people are starting to speak and they're starting to speak wisely people I think you and I both believe that the markets are very wise and very smart uh you know they get it people we understand the markets understand these things it may not be quite as quick as some would like but your fundamental question or and I think you're not confused because I don't think you're confused about too much personally but your fundamental question is a very real one how can we how can we make energy more expensive we're starting to De industrialize we're seeing companies and industries leave we're increasing the cost and the burden on the poorest amongst us that's regressive in economic terms it doesn't help the environment because the rich can actually afford to buy these things from other places import energy and again another quick fact in the US only 11 States produce more energy than they consume 39 States consume more than they produce and buy a lot and the big ones New York and California they're importing their energy well that's great as long as you can but ask Germany how that went when the Russian gas stopped it didn't go well and so we have to start to um conflate these things in what I lovingly call the radical middle and have for a couple decades we got to put these in there and there's nothing there's nothing glamorous about the radical middle it's brutal there's there's data and there's compromise and I'm not always right but it's where the big challenges lie and that middle is between energy the economy and the environment and how do those play together so that we can solve these things for real let our young people have the complexity of these they're very smart but if we keep telling it's binary clean and dirty good bad believer dener they're not going to have the tools they're they're just going to think they're evil and they're good it's it's a it's a kind of a bizarre story and most of people and I speak to a lot of people when they hear these things they come strongly to saying I want to be in there I didn't get it hadn't learned all that hadn't heard I want to be part of that complex equation and help to address these things for real so what you're doing matters a lot communicating well some of what's some of what's happening with well so imagine the attraction of that binary system is twofold okay so the first is that it's something it's very straightforward and simple industrialization has Environmental costs therefore industrialization is the problem okay so once you've identified that you don't have to think anymore you just have to be against industrialization so that solves a lot of technical problems and that reduces entropy it reduces complexity at least in the short term but then there's an additional psychological component that's unbelievably powerful and I think the radicals particularly on the environmental left have been very good at falling prey and capitalizing falling prey to and capitalizing on this so the developmental psychologist Shan P pointed out that um in a fairly large subset of adolescents um those who are maybe higher along further along the cognitive distribution so a little bit of intellectual horsepower to spare they go through what he described as a messic phase in late adolescent late adolescence and what that would mean anthropologically is that there's going to be a subset of bright kids kids who they've they removed themselves from dependency on their parents they've socialized themselves into the peer group but now they're looking to take their place in the broader world conceptually and practically and there's a philosophical element to that and the philosophical element and this is the Messianic part is that they want to do they want to act ethically and do well at the highest level of striving and so what we're offering them in our culture is the chance to play Hero on the environmental preservation front and so that satisfies that need which is a real need but it also does it in a very false way because it and this is one of its attractions just like you can oversimplify the industrialization issue industrialization is bad and all human impact on the planet is to be issued you can simplify the moral issue which is now if you're on the side of the planet you're good and your moral duty has been done now that's absurd but the thing is is that people let's say like you who are promoting the radical middle haven't elucidated a vision that's as compelling on the psychological side with regards to the Fulfillment of that deep metaphysical need as the environmentalists who offer young people the opportunity to be planetary saviors just by waving around a plard and this is a real problem and it it speaks to problems like the attitude in Germany that's anti-nuclear you know your sense is well that's irrational and look at France from whom the Germans import energy by the way who've managed a nuclear transition brilliantly and have energy to spare and at a low cost like there's no logical reason there but these so-called illogical reasons they're real reasons and they're real impediments and you know one of the things I do believe that people found attractive about your talk and about the sort of things that Bjorn lomberg are doing is that a new sort of standard is being waved which is something like well here's a better moral Vision how about we make everybody who's dirt poor Rich as fast as we possibly can and then we can have our cake and eat it too we can serve the poor which is like a classic left-wing orientation and like I've been shocked I literally I've been shocked to the degree that the radical leftists will sacrifice the poor to the planet cuz I wondered when push came to shove because there's two competing Tendencies there right there's the green environmental tendency fair enough but there's the well everything should be done in service of the poor tendency and what we've seen time and again in the UK and Germany and Canada well and around the world is that if we had to choose between hypothetically serving the planet and helping the poor we'll pick serving the planet in the Nano second and to hell with the poor and that's that's not a vision that a lot of people find particularly attractive I think you are offering an alternative to that yeah yeah and I'll be extreme in this statement but almost the elites have flipped what used to be Republicans in the US used to be sort of elite if you will and now they're working I think more with that next class than than the Democrats are the Elite it it's it's almost flipped in a strange way and again that's an extreme characterization within those bodies we have everyone okay the whole Spectrum but I I think you can have your cake and eat it too as long as you don't try to eat the whole cake right right well that's the Net Zero problem yes it's like no zero like no net zero that's the wrong measure like you can you can put that in your mind and you can remember it in a second it's a nice cliche but zero it's like you're not thinking when it's zero right well you know it turns out when that c when that report came out of the iea a couple summers ago I speak to a lot of boards and sit on several um I got a call from a chair a CEO and he said you got to come talk to my board this week and so I did I read it and it was incredible the assumptions that went into that this was preg glasow okay cop I think it was 26 in glasow um they set up a framework in which there were a lot of crazy assum but the craziest amongst them Jordan was this that the energy consumption in the world would start to go down two years later which is today down aggregate energy consumption in the world down in order to achieve that Net Zero and there were a lot of other things and I I looked at that and I I made the figures and I showed this wedge between you know GDP and human population before we Peak in 2080 Etc that's that's that's literally impossible okay it w it won't go down now we can help lower the per capita consumption and therefore start to help things nobody challenged it it became a road map for cop 26 and I was with Dan Jurgen he was on our PBS show and he said Scott you have to write this up so I put out a little piece called the road to glasgow's paved with bad assumptions you know and and it it was and but we used it as a road map I think this is the single one of the single more um destructive almost too strong of a word but destructive constructs that we're dealing with now is this concept of Net Zero now admittedly net means if you can capture some out of the air and atmosphere that's part of net so I could still emit as long as I'm offsetting by some level of capture Net Zero not absolute zero important distinction but we're not Net Zero is is kind of this weird Target that I think a lot of people have rallied around we've got to begin to think beyond that and recognize you know use an analogy I want to run a marathon you know I'm 64 years old I want to run it in four hours which I I'll never do but that's my goal let's say I run it in four and a half hours but I finish it I achieved something big you know it wasn't four hours it was four and a half hours maybe net 40 is okay or net 50 or net 30 you know we've done we've brought down but we haven't imploded the economic health and well-being of not just the poorest among us but the whole global economy which is starting to happen because if we do that the environment's going to get crushed you know it's going to be irrelevant so so so fast that look what Germany did you can't even imagine it it's not hypothetical anymore that Germany consumed more coal they burned more coal when they needed to and other economies will do the same thing when push comes to sub global leaders say it again prioritize energy security over climate security every time so we've got to F so young people you ask a good question how do you get them away from just that we have to begin to think away from a b okay it's not it's not an AB linear like that it's actually ABC you can't jump from a to c just to the environment there's energy there's the economy and there's the environment and it flows that way healthy energy underpins healthy economies healthy economies invest in the environment so the more we can accelerate that the better and and young people working in there if you could have two goals lift the world up from poverty isn't that amazing and begin to clean up the environment not perfectly but begin to clean up the environment ently intelligently well and well the other thing too on the environment front like it's also not obvious to me at all that the most compelling environmental problem is associated with carbon dioxide so well so for example one of my bug bears for a few decades has been the state of the world's Fisheries the O Oceanic management because of all the stupid things we've done in the last 100 years and we've done many things that weren't stupid but of all the stupid things we've done decimating the ocean fisheries has to rank up there very highly and like the estimates that I've read that I believe to be reasonable and I'm certainly no extremist in this matter is that we've depleted like 99% of the accessible world's accessible fish stocks and given that that's a renewable resource that can actually bounce back pretty damn quickly given how many eggs fish lay it can bounce back quickly if you leave it the hell alone it's like another part of the problem with this unidirectional obsession with climate apart from its sketchy base in in five different ways is that there are a lot of other environmental problems that we could be addressing that they just get no attention at all you and I grew up learning about water and land and air that was the environment we were protecting clean water and an abundant water uh tough problem uh clean soils and land less land use is good you know more with less and clean air not talking atmosphere air local Air so the land the air and the water are three of the four components of the environment and the atmosphere is a fourth those are not just interchangeable they're interconnected so if I start to put for example in place something that has no emissions but consumes a lot of the earth's land solar farm okay a large wind farms I just d drove through the Texas Panhandle recently you can't do it without seeing wind turbin doesn't consume all the land but they're everywhere lowdensity forms of energy use a lot of the of land to collect energy so that it can get it dense enough and abundant enough for us to use I go beyond that and say to get to those wind turbines which are composits and copper and lots of other precious resources es and solar panels which have lots of metals in them and and and other you know polysilicates uh batteries to back them up extreme amount of metals just the amount of Mining and look I'm a geologist I don't mind mining doesn't bug me because I know we mine everything we don't grow but I can also tell you the amount of mining that it's going to take to produce enough energy collectors in that system is incredible so we're talking about not just land but water mining I've never I've asked audiences every time I speak Jordan I speak to about 20 30,000 people live a year how many think mining is green and never has a hand gone up never cuz it's not you know we can make it better but it's not green so when you start to think about the Earth in that holistic sense with climate being one component of it this is another thing we have to balance the tradeoffs between the land the air water in the atmosphere and it's messy it's not perfect we have to we have to get away from this idea of Nirvana per you know Perfection if we could just get rid of CO2 in the atmosphere no it won't go that way so so one of the reasons that we so at this art conference we had a lot of music and and there there was a reason for that I mean we wanted to make the conference beautiful and we wanted to give people a breather from purely semantic discussion and but there's there's another reason that's deeper than that and it has to do with the meaning of Music per se you know you talk about tradeoffs but there's actually a there's a positive way of of describing what you're getting at with regard to tradeoffs so what you see in music is a Harmony between competing forces and the the beauty of music is the balance of that cooperation and competition across some span of time right it's it's a melody of interweaving patterns and you know that if you're somewhere where things are going well that there are many competing forces that are harmoniously balanced and there's an intrinsic Beauty to that and when you talk about tradeoffs it's a pess there's an implicit pessimism in it that you know there's going to be costs but there's another view that we tried to put forward in the art conference which is that if we get the balance between the multi multiple requirements for Life optimized that there's an intrinsic Beauty in that and that's the right Target and so it's not exactly tradeoff it's not tradeoff it's it's it's multi-dimensional optimization now it's more complex as you said because you can't because it's multi-dimensional you can't say that if we get to 100% on axis a we've now established the kingdom of God it's like well it's 70% on axis a and 6 5% on axis B and but there is a genuine Harmony and goal there yes and that's a see that's the kind of higher order goal that positively posited could be attractive to the young people for example who become hyper concerned morally about the planet absolutely right and so I know you're being hard-headed when you talk about tradeoffs but but if you have a family you're not trading off exactly between the kids yeah well I I definitely love one of my four kids better than the other three I just don't tell which one right right exactly but I use I use a I use a Turner diagram for this concept and in a triangle diagram everything has to sum it's 100% 100% on one corner as I move away from that corner I'm picking up components of the other thing but everything sums to 100% somewhere in there and the reality is in the middle somewhere that radical middle is a balance between the things we're trying to do so let's not call a tradeoff we're not giving up one we're balancing them good word that you use there very powerful harmonizing yeah so you're you're your wavelength okay so I'm going to take your music I Got Musicians for kids but those are just wavelengths in science and so those are wavelengths of different amplitudes and different wavelengths and so the big Bas wave comes in and the and the treble wave and a loud and a and a soft but they can sound beautiful together when that music is made in that way we've talked about the wavelengths of CO2 coming and going of ice coming and going nature produces a lot of things that have those embedded Cycles or waves Jordan that's how science of the earth works and we can study and measure it just like music and so finding that beautiful Harmony and by the way the music was beautiful I stayed on the brakes and filmed those musicians they were just phenomenal um is is is the goal is otherwise you end up with a cacophony of sounds that are just they're an irritant to to to hear right when you truly don't get things right or something is just Out Of Tune and you can hear that pitch difference uh you know it's like oh you know well we have an instinct we have an instinct for that balance right that harmonious balance and it's also a good place maybe and this is a good place to close this part of the discussion this is also why it's so important to rely on bottomup information propagation of the sorts that can be provided by markets it's like so our our hypothesis is well what we're aiming at now is a target that has to be specified multi-dimensionally it can't be reduced to Any Given Dimension has to be specified multi-dimensionally now that makes it complex so where is that Target and one the first answer is well we don't exactly know and the second answer is well we can take hints from bottomup markets because they're the most intelligent computational devices we have they're closest to the reality of the environment because they're made of millions of people going about their business in direct contact with their local environments and we can allow those signals to propagate and in that is some indication about what the appropriate Harmony might be so we see that Disturbed for example in Germany because the farmers have decided that the the dimensionality of the solution is inappropriate in relationship to what they need and they're throwing a Banner into the works and that's and that's inevitable and so well partly what we've been trying to do with the with the ark is to specify a little bit more explicitly what that multi-dimensional landscape might be right and then to set that as a Target that people could strive towards morally now it's complicated so it's difficult to package as a story but it does seem to me that and there isn't anything you said today I think that contradicts this is there's no reason to assume that we couldn't collectively set our minds to the uration of absolute privation through appropriate energy provision in a manner that would radically increase medium to long-term sustainability of the whole project right right I agree with that that's not a pie in the sky notion no I published a piece earlier this year which I titled Net Zero poverty right right right and and and the editor changed the title as they do but that's the concept is is to drive without that nothing else will will work Jordan nothing else Works nothing else works we have to we have to strive for that we the collective have to strive for that and the and the most important Dimension and we geoscientists geologists deal with this all the time not that I can truly understand it but probably have St it more let's just say that is the dimension of time and so we plot all these things but that time Dimension is so vital because if I'm struggling to feed my family I don't have 20 years I don't have a year I have now and yes I can think in longer terms because I'm wealthy but it doesn't mean I'm going to act in longer terms and we see this propagated over and over it's not intentional hypocrisy but it's apparent hypocrisy and what our leaders are saying and what they themselves are doing in their own personal lives and people people pick up on this they say look you don't tell me what to do if you're not willing to do it in your own life and and and so how do we get the market the whole Market engaged age and I have to believe that the Greta tumberg of the world and she's in her powerful voice could help carry this story I use her as a as a as a as a metaphor a simile for the young people could carry this story of poverty and environment together okay the Dual challenge if you will so that I gave a TED Talk a couple years ago on this the Dual Challenge and and and talked a lot about how do we we carry that and so I said to them somewhere in the middle of that talk and this was the Shocker moment as we were looking at solar panels wind turbin and batteries 1100 students in a room and I said I explained where those come from and I said there's no renewable energy don't hate me but there's no renewable energy there's nothing there's nothing renewable about mining manufacturing collecting wearing out and dumping and doing that over and over again that's not a renewable process and that they digested and a lot of L long line afterwards but this is this is this complexity a little bit that they're ready to go for you know I've got my kids range from 33 to 23 they're ready they're brilliant you know they're ready to tackle this Challenge and I know the young people in the world are as well if they can get U structured around this so at switch the not for-profit I started many years ago we do something called a case competition it's universities around the world teams of four competing on a Case competition on energy poverty and they they're multi- disciplinary teams and they have three weeks to try to lift real countries out of energy poverty and this year we gave them a pair of countries to compare and contrast and it's hard they keep wanting their each one has a volunteer Mentor very powerful and they present in real there's cash prizes you know online presentations and they they're so empowered but it's so hard and they're like there's no answer correct there's a suite of possibilities As you move out into that time future that time Dimension but you can constrain that in real ways that don't that don't fly off into sort of physics never Neverland if you will and they come away empowered I would love we've done this four years in a row several thousand students let's energize them to build these this core c PS core of young people and your network is incredible to begin to take that and run with it and let old guys like us just just invest in them and say run run run go go go how can we help you to address these two issues that would be powerful well that's an excellent place to stop and pretty much dead on time I think I'll probably name this Net Zero poverty and we'll do energy and environment the Dual challenge that seems like a good yeah yeah yeah and so well thank you very much for talking to me today and for and to everyone who's listening and watching and for walking through these problems it's so interesting a because to me when I started to study these problems more deeply all that it did was make me much more radically optimistic because what I discovered was oh I see so the solution to energy and environmental sustainability is the eradication of absolute poverty well that's a good deal like like who why would we be upset about that that's such You couldn't possibly imagine a more positive solution to that Suite of problems no more heart-rending privation and the propagation of a much more long-term view of sustainability around the world well that's a damn good deal so well so I think your talk at ARC you know went some ways and all the work you've done has gone some ways to making that a more real possibility and we'll hope that that's the direction that prevails as we move forward in this new year Jordan it's been a privilege to be on with you and thanks for the invitation and thanks for all the work you do yeah my pleasure my pleasure so thank you to everybody watching and listening and it's this is the first podcast I've done in the new year so happy New Year to all of you and thank you to the dailywire plus crew for making this possible I'm going to continue this conversation on on the dailywire plus side I'm going to talk a little bit about um the origin of these ideas I think that's what we'll delve into and also where you see them going in the future practically and how that might be facilitated by this Arc Enterprise and so for those of you who are inclined join us on the daily we plus side and um otherwise thank you very much for your time and attention today and thanks again sir very interesting thanks [Music]
