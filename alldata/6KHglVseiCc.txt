ladies and gentlemen chess is a mental Sport and being that it is a mental sport it can affect our psyche it can affect us emotionally it can affect us spiritually and in today's video I'm going to do something that I've never done before I am going to record an entire video where I don't know who I am playing against what does that mean well you see chess websites have a thing where you can mask your opponent's ELO your opponent's username and you have no idea who you're playing against on chess.com this is called Focus mode where you can focus on the board and the clock and this will prevent many of you from getting ELO anxiety or getting nervous about who you're playing against when I am playing against a grand master a player with a higher ELO than myself I frequently get nervous I experience the same thing you experience even though I might be 2 700 points higher rated than you well that would put you at zero but in any case that's the purpose of today's video so that I don't have fake confidence playing against people who are lower rated than me and so I don't feel terrified when I go up against a grand master now on trust.com this feature is available uh but for me I'm not going to use exactly Focus mode I'm gonna do it the old-fashioned way paper and tape I have taped right above where I can see my opponent's username and rating because if I did Focus mode this would happen but you can just trigger Focus mode at home and we don't have to have a broken overlay that's it that's that's what we're gonna do we're gonna test how we can improve our chess by taking away a massive component of potential anxiety I have no idea who I'm playing against uh when I see games I am playing against people you know in a range of minus 200 to plus 200 points so I could play a 2500 I could play a 2900 uh and I'm going to seek some games and we're just gonna we're just gonna have at it you know uh that's that's that's the purpose of the video I am seeking some Blitz here is my first opponent and I have no idea who I'm playing against I'm going to play a Dutch defense and then we will analyze these games as well so hopefully you learn a few things we're gonna have a little bit of fun uh and also we are going to learn my opponent is playing a sideline of the Dutch I'm gonna play Pawn to E6 now it's very common here to play this move Pawn to E4 uh I guess I'm going to take and then play Bishop F6 and I imagine my opponent will do something like that yeah and now how about uh how about we we don't let our opponent take us maybe I'll just castle for now and then maybe on the next move I won't let my opponent take me I'll play something like Bishop to E7 you had a chance to take me you missed your chance um I can develop with my knight I can also develop maybe Pawn here I think my opponent wants to play Knight E5 uh I think I'm gonna kick my opponent's night out of the center of the board the drawback of playing Pawn here is that that square becomes a little bit weak but Pawn to C5 Knight to C6 and we should be we should be fine I am a little bit preoccupied about the fact that there could be some pressure on this side of the board with with the bishop and then maybe the queen uh but I but I but I mean I don't think I'm gonna get checkmated so I think we'll be okay let's take in the center potentially opening up possibilities for ourselves uh Bishop here fights for the center puts pressure on the Knight maybe Queen F6 is next Bishop D7 to finish up the development and then we're gonna take take the file that's a move I guess I think wow that was not a good decision I feel like I feel like that Bishop wanted to attack I don't I don't think that Bishop wanted to go there uh I mean I'm I'm happy giving up this bishop I I would not like to give up this bishop that Bishop is actually kind of strong um I can move the bishop out of the way and I can also play Queen F6 it's a little bit tough to uh commentate the game uh as it is happening let's play C5 and try to liberate the position a little bit this bishop I'm fine giving away because it's very passive if I give away this bishop uh then then this bishop will be very passive and I won't have my good Bishop anymore um purpose here is to try to hammer away on this diagonal I don't think this Knight is a factor in the game anymore really no disrespect whatsoever but that's just my honest opinion uh that's a bit of an annoying move I guess I'll play Rook C8 I want to keep this defended everything is protected here I am down 30 seconds on the clock I do have to speed up it's tough because I want to be instructional but I also I also want to win the game uh it's easier to play with bonus time we can take but I don't really want to bring my opponent's Queen into the center of the board I would much rather they take me Queen G4 I guess the idea is to take here uh maybe now would be a good moment to take her maybe I can take that and then take that I feel like I feel like I'm very close here to having something I know I said I don't want to do this I gotta speed up too I gotta just budget my time better here uh also they might Checkmate me which is unpleasant I think now is the right moment to play this move because now when The Rook comes here I have various tricks on the back Rank and I don't think I'm gonna get checkmated I mean I think I have good defense because now this Knight is gone but I really do have to start playing faster um I'm just not used to playing Blitz in a YouTube video see when I live stream it's different because I can be stupid and I can say stupid stuff uh let's go Rook F7 preemptively defending everything maybe Queen here uh that move is trying to go there so I'm just gonna slide out of the way and my opponent is just trying to Checkmate me Queen f8 targeting that pawn I have good structure but I do have 50 seconds which I don't like uh what C4 pass Pawn that's not a thread there is no threat there whatsoever uh and I'm gonna I'm gonna try to break through now with my what just letting the pawn go is this now I got two past Pawns I'm not sure about this approach by my opponent here I'm not sure about this approach no that's not a good move I can I just keep going who's gonna stop me at some point you gotta go back right and maybe that's when I strike maybe I overextended though but I think this is pretty well protected and I'm getting closer on time and that night's feeling a little carelessly positioned now oh blunder I think that's very nice that Bishop came alive just at the right moment and now now this should just be a relatively straightforward game because after I take I'm also getting Queen F2 and queen H4 so opponent resigns I gained five rating points what what uh I I don't how good was this person I feel like this was like a 20 25 2600 I didn't get who did I play I'm flipping up the paper on my monitor 25.83 whose username was Knight takesh6 it's a good thing they didn't have a a chance to play that move um this was a this was an okay game I you know I didn't get uh I didn't get mega strong vibes from this individual no disrespect that you know maybe this person is a Gotham fan uh mostly because I felt like I felt like this person made made my life a little bit too simple like uh like this a major giveaway was the move Bishop B5 I thought here you know white should probably focus on this side of the board um and I just felt like the way that white played this I mean it made sense it was all logical but I felt like it it it it it made things very easy for me uh and then white went for this attack and I thought I thought I defended this position completely reasonably um and it just felt like a stronger player might have put more pressure for a longer period of time this plan ran into a very well protected King I don't think this was correct and now as my opponent committed all of their forces this way and ran into nothing I immediately snuck through with C4 and C3 and suddenly you know just I think I think this is a lesson in and of itself like how to understand peace Dynamics your opponent is ramming everything into this and you go well wait a minute don't I just have a past Pawn and then once that pawn made it to C2 it it completely took away uh all of my opponents ideas and now if my opponent's not careful I'm just gonna go Queen A3 and and and get to The Rook so that was an interesting game um came out of a Dutch I think we got a we got a pretty reasonable position and um you know we uh we did our best and then ultimately converted now I don't know if I'm going to play lower rated players the whole video um obviously the purpose of the video is to play high rated opponents and not get scared but we'll see if that happens for now I am just seeking another game all right we waited a little while we have a game now um playing with white uh my opponent plays D4 D5 which is boring so I'm gonna play kind of a weird okay well that just becomes a trumpowski now I'm gonna play Knight D2 um and uh we're just gonna we're just gonna move what that's not a good move now I'm playing a London but with an extra Tempo whoa F5 oh my goodness what what is this what is my opponent doing uh I'm kind of blown away by this I gotta tell you should I just go crazy and start attacking what if I just play normally uh I mean it's basically a a all right it's a Stonewall I am I'm getting Stonewall I'm gonna go G4 um this just doesn't feel this doesn't feel okay it does not feel like a person can play Knight F6 Knight G8 Knight F6 Knight E4 um sometimes higher rated players like to play like this to try to disrespect I uh but you know we're about to find out okay Pawn takes there is Bishop takes which I guess is a slightly annoying switch that I overlooked I you know I I kind of don't want to take because I I want to get rid of my opponent's blockade but if take take take there was Pawn takes oh man I might have to play this very annoying move it's it's not all bad though it's not all bad let's play Queen E2 and try to Castle queenside I and of course this Knight needs to go to E5 and again I'm just down 45 seconds on the clock I mean it's so annoying 95. all right we got our Knight to where it wants to go now we're gonna castle queenside and opponent is still playing at light speed for some reason I wonder if I can trap this Knight somehow by playing like Knight F1 and pawn to F3 that looks kind of interesting I expect C5 my opponent strikes me as a very very aggressive player and they might just try to sacrifice the Knight and I was correct um F3 takes takes they might take I'm gonna get all ah this is so annoying and now they have takes takes in Queen B6 setting up a double attack on my king and then also this Pawn in the center of the board I mean I feel like the chess gods are just nice to some people you know like some people play so fast and not well I I like I I don't think this person is playing that well but somehow they're surviving somehow they're surviving I really thought I was gonna trap their piece there now it's night versus Bishop they have some pressure here with the Rook that's a hanging Pawn but I feel like taking it would be really stupid first of all you would lose this Pawn uh uh let's go Rook G3 my I gotta be careful of my opponent in the center too okay looks like they are bringing reinforcements maybe I can reroute to that square but for a second game in a row I'm I'm very unhappy with how I've handled my clock no what no surely that can't what what is that move whoa is this what no no no no no no no you no no no no no no no whoa what is this am I getting checkmated what is am I getting mated is there a mate I'm getting mated right check I mean I don't see it but it's gotta be here check I block there's Gotta Be You oh check check and then somehow you win my Rook probably and this is what happens when you get low on time I feel like this is a high rated player but if I if I don't know I'm very frustrated though because again I mean I just played so slowly but I like that they're spending all their time now that's at least nice CH where is the mate I mean I I'm supposed to be what can I run oh it's mate I took away my own Escape Square oh my god oh oh and I lost 10 rating which means that they were oh they were lower rated than me oh my gosh just panicked in low time I mean I'm sure it's a losing position anyway yeah Bishop D7 was a good move who did I play I played a 2600 who says chess is life all right chess's life yeah this guy this guy really played Knight G8 I lost a knight G8 what is Knight G8 that is so crazy I can't believe dude just undeveloped because I feel so stupid right now it's crazy I had an okay position I just uh I guess this whole plan was just yeah this is just a bad move my plan was you know his Knight can't trade and I'm gonna go here and then he just did this and I reacted very poorly I guess I should have yeah computer says I should have gone here I thought oh I'm so smart I'm gonna trap his Knight but he was quick with the counter play and uh yeah that was that wow and then and then I got myself into trouble this is under Fire that's under Fire all right we got another game um to play Carl Khan's the only opening I know how to play play A6 hoping for two nights and then Bishop G4 opponent is not committing this Pawn forward which is I feel like a thing that a lot of people do or taking okay now we're gonna go C5 best move is here hopefully they don't they don't play it it's gonna give me a lot of information I feel like okay yeah weaker players don't play like this but I guess my opponent is not a weaker player let's take and maybe start attacking on the diagonal wow Bishop to wow Bishop B4 King F1 that's how bad my opponent didn't want to block all right I guess I'll Castle I have good nights I think my opponent has a very targetable Center maybe F6 now to just start immediately hammering away uh but I but I just want to play faster this game I just want to play faster I have learned my lesson I am just too slow in talking about my moves F6 is a very very big decision because I'm severely weakening uh the position but I I think it's for a good cause I think it's for a good cause I think this is a this is a very important opening of the position that must occur I don't think my opponent can really allow that to happen I'm looking to sacrifice my Rook because you know me but uh I don't you know of King G2 but there's nothing there I'm just gonna double up gonna double up and have pressure that's what we're gonna do all right I'm gonna double up and have pressure maybe something will block me maybe I'll double anyway like this my nights are good but I I'd like to make this night better my knight would be better there my knight might be better on those two squares E5 expected why did I say E5 I meant to say G4 I'm not even saying the right 95 take Rook F2 is actually really interesting but I don't and maybe I have Bishop C5 this is an insane move I'm gonna play it I calculated Pawn takes Rook takes F2 check x-ray defense oh my goodness this might be one of the nicest moves I've ever played I'm not sure it's a great move I'm not you know it just looks really really cool uh and now maybe Knight F3 or Knight takes G4 I feel like getting rid of the bishop is smart although Knight C4 could have been reasonable as well uh and maybe now maybe now I maybe maybe now I just keep coming in with a knight I just keep coming in I just have to be confident just have to be confident Knight C4 and I looks like I'm gonna be getting this Pawn looks like I'm getting this Pawn which is really nice because that means I'll probably get that pawn too yeah this is this is clean if Ruby one I have Knight C4 then there's Bishop G5 Bishop G5 I can play Rook F7 trade and protect my Pawn like this and that's guarded I guess A4 Fork Rook B3 Fork so I'm I'm gonna pick up a couple of Pawns here and I have a 20 second I didn't get to pick up the second Pawn unfortunately or we're gonna play B5 to make sure that's never a weakness uh that makes sense that's also annoying I kind of don't want to play this move but it feels like a necessity because I need to kick the night out otherwise I will have some problems with my movement uh the Knight is maybe trying to come here see Nat now is the part of the game where I'm gonna I'm gonna start taking way too much time because I'm getting nervous that I'm winning and I'm also getting nervous despite being on Focus mode that I might be beating somebody strong which is this is where my nerves start kicking and and this is not where your nerve should kick in you should be a it should be a machine here Free Pawn threatening this Rook here rookie five I have King F6 I think very very close to making a fatal mistake but I haven't made it yet um takes Knight C4 hits The Rook they're gonna give me that check probably also right that's defended though I can kick this out and I can just push I'm very scared though check and maybe get into the center here yes and just keep going Rook B1 I can just push no check nothing there push uh Queen this is crazy this is an insane position takes run away and that's made if I do that so I guess I have to dance my way out of this I have to make a lot of King moves and then I have to block with my Rook when it's time very stressful position but it looks like we're gonna get it done check now the king is cut off and I guess I'll go to G7 which looks safe okay I blundered that pawn I have 16 seconds Rook here trying to go for a mate not allowing myself to get checkmated and we got it nice and how many rating points did I gain that was a 2500 come on y'all oh my goodness oh that was a that was a very tough game but I did mention in the beginning that uh my opponent I mean was playing was playing very very well uh but I thought yeah I mean 95 was a was an aw it looked like a really cool move uh the computer thinks it's a it's my my idea here of this move was if takes then I can play Rook takes F2 which is super cool and you can't take me because that's actually a checkmate I thought I was really clever it turns out that I am um turns out I am not clever it says you may not use analysis while playing chess what that was weird I wasn't playing chess chess.com I was finished with my game as a matter of fact uh all right let's play uh let's let's play Let's play another one um we'll play we'll we'll keep going all right I've got the white pieces again let's I'm trying to have a better showing than the last time I want to beat a grand master I want to see if I can beat a grand master okay this does not strike me like I'm playing a grand master this person is playing goofy openings but I have more space what is that okay it's gonna develop it's developing can I already take by the way take and try to win the pawn or is that wishful thinking uh I can also Gambit upon here by playing Knight E2 could also play E5 Maybe this strikes me as very suspicious what my opponent is playing like I I've I I'm gonna try to refute it right away I'm gonna try to ah just attack just attack there's multiple ideas of this move first of all it disconnects the Bishop from the Knight second of all it fights for the dark squares I'm trying to win some dark squared control uh by taking and having a wedge also it clears that route from my knight which not only puts pressure on those aforementioned dark squares also I can play Pawn to C3 Knight to five is a smart move I'm gonna slide back and keep pressure on that pawn so this Pawn can't really move forward uh um yeah Knight E4 and my position looks really nice now I have to say I have to say maybe D4 A4 I kind of like this sort of flank instigating oh I should have been more careful yeah Pawn to D5 was uh kind of clearly the idea there but okay it's fine I think I still have nice control of the dark squares and it's kind of an annoying position for my opponent at least that's what it feels like F6 is not possible because I can take that's a big decision for my opponent which way to Castle I'm controlling the movement in the center they do choose to Castle but I feel like G4 is is coming right up and you still can't play F6 because I'll just take and then take on E6 yeah this looks really nice for me I have to say maybe I just go King G2 or maybe I play Knight H4 and it's a very very tense moment here because I I might just overwhelm okay I saw that but I thought I can just can't I just take and then taking on G6 too risky is that is that the point fascinating D4 also could be a thing I kind of don't hate this move trying to control the move E5 it feels like this position is just me not letting my opponent move at all but wow they still go E5 is the idea to take on G4 oh my goodness what this is like an anime moment you know they they played the entire thing that I was working so hard to stop can I play like uh rookie five I'm spending too much time again Rook takes E5 Pawn takes E5 Bishop takes ah this is so stressful I guess I'm trying to bring my Rook into the game [Music] Rook G3 E6 I gotta move I gotta make a move I'm too stressed just too stressed oh my goodness I knew this was a blunder I can't say because of this yeah I don't even know how to resign I don't even know where the resign button is and this person is rated 26.94 yeah tough I didn't get a chance to play a grand master today I'm just losing games to people who are lower rated than me uh definitely had an advantage from the opening I feel like a around here plus 0.5 nothing crazy but I went for this aggressive plan and I completely played into a way to stop something and it turns out that did not stop that something because I cannot take if I take I actually get x-rayed here on this file well not x-rayed but laser beamed so that's kind of unfortunate um sort of bummed uh you know what maybe we'll try for one last game I I don't maybe I'll get a Grand Master maybe maybe they all have me blocked maybe that's maybe I will not get to play against the Grand Master because they all have me blocked on chess.com I don't know okay this will be the last game of the video because hopefully it's a grand master we are hunting Grand Masters I hope B3 I'm playing a variation of the Sicilian Defense known as the Magnus Sicilian I'm gonna throw in this check on the king and then I'm gonna take and put my queen on D2 so it's out of the scope of the Knight and we're gonna play against that pawn that's what we're gonna do I'm gonna play Pawn to F3 which defends E4 and opponent is doing what they want to do I'm doing what I want to do preventing the knight from getting over here black will find a way to develop everybody's gonna have a good time well hopefully just me sliding the king off the line here very very common uh B5 is on the way but uh I you know I feel like I feel like my own attack is also on the way you know what you want to attack me we're gonna see who's who I'm gonna go G4 and G5 that's that's what that's what we're doing maybe G4 I'm gonna I'm gonna try to have no doubts in this game you know just try to trust myself Knight D5 this is fine but I I don't think maybe I can take with a pawn but I'm not gonna I'm not gonna overthink it I can overthink it Queen takes sometimes when you don't overthink things you make horrible mistakes then you lose that is life uh Rook D2 defends against that uh I gotta decide at some point I need to decide if this attack actually is of any substance or not how about we play do we like F4 Knight G3 Knight F5 I think Knight G3 is a little bit too slow I do like F4 a lot I'm trying to convince myself that it's a good move just trying to open up the diagonal yeah opponent doesn't even hesitate just like takes immediately uh and uh I'm gonna go G5 now to restrict okay that was unexpected I did not think that I would have to deal with my the consequences of my own actions over here I don't think F3 is a very good move I don't think it's a very good move uh it just helped my knight get exactly to where it wants this is what my opponent was probably thinking to do but it does not strike me like there was much of an attack there now I think I'm cooking uh this does not look very good for black I think at some point my opponent might need to consider a queen trade like right now actually I should have maybe played Rook G1 it's probably what I should have done probably could have had some Knight to F4 interesting checks captures attacks always take and then Queen D4 and then F6 then I can play Queen F6 and Bishop G7 so maybe I play something else let's go Queen D4 am I like going crazy or queen C5 is a huge mistake now because of Knight H6 and then they can't take because of this Maybe I am not convinced but it's been a bad day of Blitz for me my brain has sort of been off night age no that doesn't quite work it's very unfortunate that it doesn't work I gotta I gotta speed up again at age six King h8 I'm gonna go Knight H6 check between D5 threatening this but I already think I'm screwing up the problem with chess is that it's it's a very cerebral activity like you mess up enough and you just start getting very frustrated with yourself Knight C3 I'm just going for it I don't know if this is working but I think Knight C3 check now take Pawn takes hitting my Rook and I and I and I feel like I've I feel like I've messed this up definitely feel like I've messed this up it looks like they could just take my knight now yeah 100 yeah yep the position has been screwed up yep yep that night was too strong and maybe I still have chances to save this but I'm not confident it has not been it has not been a good day for chess sometimes that happens unless they blender a mate that would be ideal I don't even know how on Earth that would happen now they're panicking maybe now they see they're playing me they're panicking I'm always the one panicking but [Laughter] that's just mate well done well done and who did I lose to this game oh wow we almost had the same level bad day definitely a bad day uh wow I was winning here but it was very it was very um obscure in this position I actually had to just take the Knight which maybe maybe I could have seen that and then H6 and then this would have been very powerful taking and yeah and then this actually makes sense because even if I get checked I'm completely safe from all of this no it makes sense I mean I I did not see that so I'm not going to now I was not considering that whatsoever instead I tried to do it this way uh but this came in and I am just in severe trouble and I realized right away well our experiment was unsuccessful uh I did not play a single Grandmaster and I lost more games than I uh won now that might just mean that today was a bad day for chess uh or it might mean that uh that that Focus mode no it it Focus mode actually does work quite a bit I am I'm gonna keep trying there might be a sequel um but this generally is a good thing to play when you don't have to record a video and talk all your moves out loud um unfortunately today I had to do exactly that and I did not do a good job I'm gonna go be sad because being sad when you lose chess games it's normal so normalize being sad after you lose chess games um that's all that's all that's that's that's all for today uh bye get out of here
