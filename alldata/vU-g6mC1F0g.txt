Hey Brady, I am Matt Henderson. I like making mathematical animations and I wanted to show a few that relate to the patterns of orbits in the solar system. The first one is the inner planets; and so this is the approximate pattern that the inner planets trace out - obviously things aren't to scale. We've got the Sun, we've got Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars going around in their approximate orbits and relative speeds. So they're spinning around, the Sun is at the centre and now we're to actually move so we're following Earth. And we're interested in, what are the patterns that 
are traced out by the other planets? From kind of like from the perspective of Earth we start to see some interesting patterns. The pattern from Venus is starting to be quite regular. We'll start to see this kind of five-pointed shape; you can see we've got one of the points here, we've got two, three, and the next time Venus comes around it completes this five points: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. And that's because the ratio of the orbits between Venus and Earth are- is in an 8 to 13 ratio so the difference there is accounting for the five-fold symmetry. In general it's just
like a pretty pattern. I think these are called epicycloids, they're kind of like the spirograph patterns that you get rolling circles around circles. And those just happen to be the ones that the planets trace out. Now let's look at this asteroid Cruithne, that has been referred to as Earth's second moon, but that's just a sensationalist kind of thing. It is- what it is is an asteroid that's in orbital resonance with the Earth which means- in this case it means that its year is the same as Earth's year; but it's not orbiting Earth, it's also orbiting the Sun but in a more kind of elliptical orbit. So if we mistakenly thought it was orbiting orbiting the Earth then what would its orbit look like? It wouldn't be a circle, it'd be some kind of mix of circles and ellipses or something; so let's see. So again we start out with the Sun at the centre; Earth is orbiting and
then this is Cruithne, this little asteroid that is orbiting with the same year. Now we've shifted to the perspective of the Earth and the path that Cruithne is tracing out is this kind of kidney bean shape - again this these aren't the exact correct orbits but it's roughly kind of like what's going on. So we don't see an elliptical orbit; if we were wrong and we thought Earth was the centre of the solar system then Cruithne would be the sort of weird second moon tiny asteroid guy that is orbiting us in this kind of kidney bean shape. 
- (Brady: That would) (take some explaining if you believe that) (the Earth was at the centre of) (everything!)
- Yeah that's a kind of complicated behaviour to explain, but I suppose it's just built up of a circle and an ellipse kind of added together, so maybe as soon as you saw that you might invent that explanation. (You put these on Twitter but what have) (you done in the past?)
- Yeah I used to run this blog on Tumblr that- where I posted mathematical GIFs and back then I don't think they were quite as good as my new ones, I think I've sort of progressed a little bit. So for example, you know, this was the new Cruithne animation, this is the old one here. It's explaining the same shape but it takes a little bit longer to see exactly what's happening; possibly because you don't have that shift in perspective, you know where you establish the orbits with the Sun at the centre and then you shift to just following Earth because Earth is stationary. You can kind of see 
what's going on, right? (The Sun's stationary too in that one) Yeah the Sun is stationary as well. So if we look at the new one, the Sun is also still stationary right, but the fact that the Sun is at the centre of the old one is maybe a bit confusing as well. Here I've just put Earth is the centre to emphasise that we're doing a sort of geocentric thing. In both I've done the trick of having like stars in the background, which are just randomly generated points, but the stars that sort of swing around I think helps to show you're in a sort of weird reference frame that's rotating with the Earth. (And then you've got another 
old one too from there?) Yeah, related to this ratio of Venus and the Earth: got this one here which is, you have Venus going around, you've got Earth going around, and you just draw a line between the two. It's a bit different to tracing the relative path but you get a similar shape, you get that five-pointed shape that I pointed out before.
- (It's fun stuff all this) (planets isn't it?)
- Yeah, and I mean for me it's kind of just a way to talk about the spirograph patterns, epicycloids, that you get from circles rotating around. It's just kind of fun to plug in the numbers that roughly correspond to like Venus and Earth for example. And, of course, it's not exactly 8 to 13 ratio but it gives the 5 pointed symmetry because 8 plus 5 is 13. Today's episode has been brought to you by Brilliant. Now we often focus on all their great math courses, like these ones, but it seems appropriate today to let you know they happen to have this epic course on Gravitational Physics. As you can see it's jam packed with stuff relating to today's video, but going much much deeper of course. Brilliant is fun, it's engaging; it's educational of course, but most importantly it's really interactive. Why not visit today and see what a great resource they've created?
