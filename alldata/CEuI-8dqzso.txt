hi and welcome to how to submit your talk to meeting c plus um two weeks ago we had an event about speaking for c plus at events uh where nine great speakers shared their insights about how to prepare and give talks and the motivation behind organizing this is basically that i want to level the playing field but also give this all those informations which were like shared there to the community to you know motivate folks to give talks and to start talking or to to start you know either to start talking or to um give talks again um and these were the nine talks which were given um they're all on youtube they're great talks to see if you like you know have plans to give a talk uh they can help you in planning and giving your talks but i realized that the one thing we kind of not talked about is um how do you actually submit your talk and i thought this is maybe something which i want to cover a bit in depth to you know get people to know this um so of course you know who should submit a talk and if you want to give a talk submit a talk um generally a talk submission is idea and if the community likes it this idea is then being presented at the conference so you do not have to uh sub you like have a finished talk to submit to the conference most of the talks which are submitted are ideas and then folks start working on it in august september october to have their talks ready in november okay so if you want to give a talk then please think about submitting to media c plus plus um and that's what we're gonna talk about now the process of the submission for my conference um i want to point out that it's very similar to other conferences so they also ask you for a talk title and a talk submission uh process is similar there's some some little differences but this is now covering uh the process for for this year and for meeting superstars and because of that just take some of the things i say was a bit of a grain of salt on this is will be a bit opinionized okay so let's go um so step one is just you need to create an account this is a basic requirement for basically interacting with my website um i want to point out if you're like interested in what mini c plus plus does once you have news about the upcoming conferences uh subscribe to the meeting super plus newsletter and if you'd like to get an overview on the latest blog posts uh every week per email you can do that with subscribing to the weekly blog roll also um the next step then would be to go to the conference page and then go to the submission page and then the first thing you will see is the speaker bio form which also is later when you fill this out linked to it available to edit it um and there you basically show a description of yourself the picture is optional but if your talk is accepted you should like you know see that you get one or that you have one ready to update your speaker bio with it um i do quickly want to point out that we now have a review feature and if you want to join the group which gives folks the basic feedback on their submissions you're welcome to do so um the feedback there is more like on the forum if there's any arrows in it etc i'm gonna talk about that a bit later uh too and then i want to point out this is the basic uh text editor kind of thing which i use for my website it's tinymce and um basically that's what lets you enter all the longer texts on want to point out that this uh chain symbol is where you enter links and you're you're welcome to link to your page to to other things in your bio and your talk description would like you know make sense and also the pointy brackets are where you can you kind of you know see the html and that can be helpful if you copy paste things from other websites or from word then maybe this also copies the style and you might want to remove that um and now you are ready to submit your talk okay um so this is the basic submission form and let's break this down into its components these are the two most important public fields your talk title and the talk description and i'd just like to go into these now for the talk title please keep it short be precise be concise um i see a ton of people trying to include top like subtitles and trying to cover everything about their talk in their talk title uh i would ask you to step away from doing so to be careful not to like you know if i see people adding things to their titles and brackets to explain things and that's like you know your talk title can stand on its own and it should stand on its own and doesn't need to have like a comma and a subtitle explaining the first part of your title um you should be careful with like you know this make sure your titles are good titles that's something to think about and that's why i have the edit function that you can later you know if you have we usually don't have like the best idea for a talk title at the start um so if you have a better title it comes to your mind change it that's really good to to do um and be aware so for certain characters um they can be hints like you have this typical uh talk title and then subtitle category and if that gets too long it's bad and also i'm going to take the liberty to maybe shorten your talk title if i think it's too long uh for the conference because i you know have to see how it displays in the schedule etc and um another problem i have is html entity conversion because yes that contains then a semicolon and that makes a bit of a problem with notifications because there i use csv files and of course there are exceptions like you know c plus plus uh all the things which c plus plus and cumbersome et cetera and other things there's this is like really just him from me um to think about your talk title and when we are talking about this uh good titles are engaging how to how i how we did or use using cpr for you know using super plus 24 databases using cpr plus 20 for writing tests uh these are good titles think about that these are engaging titles people directly know what you're talking about means can be good like constant expressions all those things was a great talk um but i want to point out that not all and everyone is like familiar with all the memes and so what you might have in mind is maybe not the best idea also recently you know some people seem to pick up to use uh well-known phrases or quotations from other people to name their talks um that can be getting difficult for folks to map your talk title to what your talk is about and for beginners that's if you start giving talks that's not the best idea um very low hanging fruit fun for giving talks is always to give an introduction or overviews on libraries on various other things um just be aware like the very popular thing in introduction overviews of c standards so if you want to give an overview on c plus 23 that's a nice idea but you will have a lot of competition if you want to uh give an overview on a library you use or you have written um that that will be a talk which is in that content area probably for itself or has very little competition so uh might get because of that accepted and the other talk which is the has a lot of competition uh might because of that not get accepted okay um and let me point out that of course the all those rules are broken by well-known speakers and because you know if you know the rules you can break them like an artist and well-known speakers um often get away with more things in that regard because people are coming to their talks because they have a proven track record of giving good talks and then people are like well where should i go oh i know that speaker i i trust this speaker and even if the title isn't weird i've you know read the talk description and like this kind of or makes makes me interested to see what they say and also they get away with that during the the review of okay i've seen that on uh not on on meaning superstar so far but on other platforms the talks are not enormously reviewed and then it's a big influence on like oh that's that's because they give great talks we should tell them at the conference um so the title can be again engaging it doesn't have to be but i think for new speakers it's an important thing to think about that people should know what your talk is about from the title that they can kind of fear things from it okay um which brings me to the talk description um it's basically near what your talk is about that's not a big surprise right um so should be more than a paragraph it can include code snippets in that case i would prefer you to use the pre-tag which you can do with you know the pointed records very easy it's not a blog post so don't really write too much i mean i mean you can do that i'm happy to have that but that's probably not going to get so much attention by the audience just saying that um you can and should link to important things like the library you're documenting cpv reference good board etc you know just um be aware if you copy and paste from other platforms or other conferences that there might be copy and paste artifacts in your uh thing what you just pasted so uh again you might want to check the html for style uh things which have been inserted by the copy paste artifact into you um and that might that might influence how your talk then looks in the voting system etc i usually try to catch that i'm not always sketching it but um that way you see if that is like you know a problem or not um brings me to the outline um how do you envision your talk uh it's very popular to have your talk chapters or slide titles to use in a numbered list or a list of thoughts um to also basically just have folks you know what they should know about the talk or what you know about your talk and what you plan it's a free text you can do what you want in this basically but um it's only visible to reviewers and voters it's not visible to the audience and it's not public during the event if you wrote your talk description and then write your outline after that read your talk description again and see if there are things in the outline which you didn't mention it's like the typical one paragraph talk description and then writing the outline and then you probably could add a second paragraph about what you you know came up with with that and that's often a very good idea i've seen that happen multiple times um and then there's this audience thingy which you know lets you select for who your audience or which audience you target it's kind of important and also kind of ignored by folks so yes it gives no orientation but uh it gives kind of you know [Music] your audience an expectation on the level of coverage and content they will see um and basically it's like who should come to your talk or like who do you want or what do you offer in the content in your talk okay if you give a beginner talk on landlords uh they're probably still gonna become some advanced focusing to your talk because they just are interested in seeing their talk um and maybe they learn something right um after all this is still super fast and you never stop learning um if if you give the the similar talk about londoners but for advanced folks still beginners are probably going to be in your talk because they are interested in lambdas and talk in parallel is interesting enough and so they sit in your talk and learn something about it um this is the way kind of you know to to to give folks an expectation on what level of content you will present um and also most combinations of those three work in theory you can choose them all but um yeah so let me quickly also talk about the other options you have to uh you can select you don't have to just can leave that back at us that's fine um the first of them and they're not connected they don't uh they don't have anything together right so the first is that your talk premieres at the conference which means that it's not being presented at other conferences in front of or not not after the conference but like you know this basically lets me know that this talk is from hearing at me in c plus you can give it a user group in front of that to practice your talk that's fine a lot of people do that um but it kind of is a signal to me because i as a conference organizer need to know like where have talks been before they come to the conference um there is a lot of speakers which submit their talks to cppcon and hence have given their their talk at cppcon and then give it a meeting crossbus that's also good uh that way they have you know practice their talks and they will get feedback and it sees the things which they want to do differently and usually then when they come to me and see us um they will have improved their talks which is a benefit to the community but um not everyone can speak at cppcon and some people don't want to speak there or you know however you are able to present their own on administration so this is basically a way to let me know that this talk will be first presented at meeting c plus plus and then maybe you know go to other conferences to accuse c bus bus if we won't see cppcon on the next year that's all then fine but that way uh i can i kind of you know have a selection criteria to have some talks um which are totally new to the audience and have some talks which are already have been given et cetera so that we have a good mix of talks it's not a very important criteria but i wanted to give people an option to you know say that they are specifically prepare this talk for the conference um [Music] which brings me to the submission review just if you want to have feedback on your submission um please choose that and i will try to give you feedback on the submission if you don't get feedback that might mean that you already have done everything and i might not bother you with telling you that everything is okay um and this feedback system makes you visible to other speakers which have chosen to be in the group for review reviews right now it's only meeting the best person myself and you can expect to [Music] um you know hear about mistakes i have seen in your talk description or title you know typos etc um things i think you should improve uh the classic thing that you have hidden stuff in the outline which is fine a lot of people do that but then you know just giving a little hint your talk description will be a lot better to when you add the second paragraph about the second part of your talk which you might not have thought about when you wrote the talk description then you wrote the outline um again as i said when you write the outline visit your talk description again and see that there may be a second paragraph to write um if you have a second speaker some people do then check this box and this will trigger a form and the next step to add the data for the second speaker and that's basically it um which brings me to the last and for this year very important option to signal to the conference that your talk is online only meeting c is looking for folks to be part of the online conference and to speak there online uh it's a huge chance for new speakers because there's already a lot of folks which want to present in berlin and we're limited in space this year and um so if you for various reasons cannot be at the conference or don't want to be maybe at the conference pandemic or travel restrictions we all have you know played that through through the last two years um that's the option to let me know that you are set for being online and um that will give your talk and edge to the talks which are basically in competition for both right so i will of course when i select the talks for the online track look who who wants to speak online who's already ready and who's in that and then i will select them first and the others then we'll have to compete for what is there um another track to think about is the pre-recorded track i plan to have a track where people have their talks pre-recorded either on themselves or was myself um so that we have one track which we do not have to care for having staff in a studio which presses go live and have the speaker get their talk live that eases a lot of stress on the conference and there's something which we plan to have this year um also quickly i want to tell you that there is no onsite only if you are a speaker and submitting to this conference i do expect you to be ready to speak online also when you are submitting or when you are like chosen to be like your talk makes it to to on site still beyond the pandemic and for for whatever reason maybe you're not able to make it to the conference then your talk will be online and we as a conference will be ready to stream your talk into the art to the audience in berlin from online and you should be ready too for this case even if you know it's unlikely and but that's that's how this year is and how the future is you know online is the new default um and then the last thing you you have to do in this form is of course you know to send it and to submit your talk um you will be able to edit it you will receive an email with an edit link which if you click it will simply load the form the same form you just saw to edit your talk um also on the talk submission form there are then suddenly links which go to the edit form for the speaker bio and also to a listing of your submitted talks which uh con includes like a state and also includes um the edit link if you want to edit your talk again okay so the next steps then um are that once the call for talks has ended there will be a kind of a one week period where you can edit your submission because some some people have second source i want just to to enable folks to uh have a chance to to finalize their submissions and then the voting will start uh the voting in the voting the talk info is visible and the speaker info isn't so it's kind of anonymously and how anonymous you want to have your review it's kind of up to you as just some people where they want to give a talk about their library everyone knows who they are and it would be pointless to anonymously try to have people talk about this so we are a small community everyone would think that this is that speaker but we already had also people uh submit talks and then um people were like oh this community member must have submitted a lot of talks because there's a lot of talks on that topic and they're very known for it and really and in reality they didn't have so much limited talk on that topic at all so you know take that as a grain of sword as a counter measure i do have like i think uh former speakers and my staff can see the speaker info and that is simply for making provisions to you know have some people judge a talk on who the speaker is um additionally to the talk info of course um and the selection for the tracks is guided by voting results but 2022 is again special we have the 10-year conference uh we are very limited in space due to the pandemic in berlin and we are hybrid and so i will have to see you know who comes in the selection to speak in berlin who will have to speak online and um then who will volunteer for the pre-recorded track okay and that's pretty much it thank you for listening if you have any questions comments engagement um i i really want to motivate you to start speaking or to submit your talk to this year's conference this is a conference website again you can reach out to me on twitter or via email if you have any questions and that thank you
