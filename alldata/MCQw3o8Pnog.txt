ladies and gentlemen today is a very exciting day in the Chess World As We Begin a 2 million dollar chess tour the Champions chess tour of 2023 where all of the world's best players are going toe-to-toe over the course of several months to win a lot of money this is an event primarily that is held online but obviously uh once we get down to the final eight as the event goes longer and longer they will likely do a live final just like they did last year with the um chess.com Global Championship now where this event gets really weird is that every single event there is three different divisions so division a or division one has the best players in the world Magnus Carlsen Hikaru Etc then there's division b or division two which has like all the world's best that are not in division a and then there's division C or division three where it's like the people who are not even qualified for me it's a lot of players a lot of people I've put a link in the description uh if you want to like see who's in what bracket um the the rules are very complicated and as this event goes on and on I think it's time to like learn the rules and understand the format and everything for now let's just enjoy the chess but essentially the better you perform in the subdivisions the higher chance you have of qualifying to a future division a and if you win division a or any of these events you qualify for these super mega Ultra super cool Grand Final I hope that makes sense sort of if it doesn't you know it'll start making sense uh in the future so this is the very first event The Knockout of group a and Magnus is playing against Alexis Serana Alexis Arana is the Russian player who actually beat Magnus in the world Blitz championship Magnus plays deform and lo and behold basically a worse nightmare situation of any human on the planet uh Magnus plays the Catalan uh and uh yeah I mean Magnus playing the Catalan is really it's really tough to meet because it's uh it's essentially a positional squeeze of an opening where Magnus gets to play a million different move orders like he did the World Chess Championship match and then you know in this position like any normal person on the planet would Castle yeah Magnus plays H4 because you know what yeah because he plays H4 because that's that's what he does doesn't Castle doesn't you know just H4 and so the thing about H4 is that he's obviously gonna go well no it's not obvious at all you would think he's gonna go H5 H6 I think he wants to play Knight G5 in the future um not right now but the point is that black can't actually take the Knight uh this is called a fishing pole or fish hook and now the rook and the queen are very strong and you're really only able to do this if you haven't castled you see if you Castle after H4 it's still probably fine but H4 becomes Dumber uh so Magnus just acts like you know nothing happened he plays E4 very aggressive and he then plays Knight G5 now uh the computer wanted black to take this Free Pawn and just sort of hang on with B5 and stuff a little hard to do uh so Magnus does it this way and then instead of taking the pawn back in the center of the board he just plays the move D5 this is clearly some sort of like ridiculous preparation that he's come to the board with uh point is that again he has various attacks black is never able to do this because that's actually not a threat like by the time that you take on G5 I will take and my attack here on the H file is ridiculously strong so an absolutely fascinating idea in the Catalan to just play H4 then blow up the center and then put the Knight on G5 and then I mean this is like this is dank this is some really dank stuff here D5 serrana cannot even take the Free Pawn uh because after Knight takes and Bishop takes he's probably too concerned about this and at some point Magnus will take this back and his attack will continue so uninterrupted and I mean meanwhile white has every single piece actively participating in the attack every you know pressure constantly so Serana goes astray uh with Knight H5 and uh tries to fight back with his F Pawn the problem is that by fighting back with the zeph pawn yes he is only temporarily securing the center but what he's doing is he's weakening the squares behind him all right so we have Knight E6 and now Magnus can take the Rook but the Rook is not the priority right now the rook's relative value is about the same if not lower than that Knight so there's something called relative value in a chess game which is the fact that as a game is going on a piece either loses or gains value compared to its original value that Rook is not worth five points that Knight is not worth three that night's probably a four point night and that Rook is I don't know four is generous locked away in the corner like that and not moving at all I don't know maybe a three and a half Point night so that night is super strong and Magnus takes this opportunity to play a very nice Pawn break G4 attacking the Knight sacrificing a pawn to remove the center defense and now this and I mean it's just going from bad to worse here for Serana I mean good Lord all these problems to deal with now finally Magnus does take the rook and just castles because every good player knows like sometimes the pressure is over and now it's time to just start converting could he have not castled could he have played Bishop F5 and yeah yeah but the thing is long castles is nice and practical because he just slides his King over to B1 he's up in exchange he all in exchange being a rook for a night he also has a pass Pawn he has everything that you need as a 2800 rated player to convert a position so what does he do locks in his Bishops puts his Rook smack dab in the middle of Black's position and brings the Knight as well and the position's just gonna collapse too much pressure and now we begin The Chopping down process first I take the Knight then I take the Knight then I bring my queen I take the pawn and I'm simply going for the glory Queen H5 rookie seven and Serana has absolutely no way of stopping Rook H7 and mate that was obliteration Magnus just I mean vanquished his opponent like absolutely I mean he played a Catalan he played some normal moves and my man went H4 and absolutely never looked back like that game was never close and Magnus did knock out serrana he met he was the uh first semi-finalist remember it's it's very confusing so if you'd like to look at the bracket at any point I've put a link in the description to clear up any of your confusion there's like 100 players in this event but because Magnus and Serana and in group a they are kind of the elite so they don't have to touch anybody else it's kind kind of like Society you know yeah anyway there were some other matchups uh including the one Hikaru was playing Hikaru was going up against gukesh so this is also group a and uh yeah gukesh went after Hikaru he played a very forcing line played a nimso Indian and then he played A3 very forcing line trying to get the bishop off the board and then he played like this which is E4 trying to play for E5 and some attack on the king and when Hikaru took a step back go cash played H4 I was like what the I've never seen this why'd everybody go on H4 all the time I mean seriously it's like it's a chess.com Quest that if you unlock you know you're gonna get six months Diamond membership H4 what what does that move even begin to do I don't know uh as a human you know I'm thinking four pawns I'm thinking Bishop E3 to move my knight to move my queen that's what I would play but I'm commentating the games I'm not playing them um and then he just plays H5 like why did he not go D5 you know I understand this is gonna happen but I I figure you know Knight G3 or something and then I'll defend my Pawn oops I'll defense I can't even draw the arrows how are you gonna let me play the game but he just plays H5 and then he just plays H6 I mean gukesh just doesn't care he's like all right I'm attacking now very important moment Hikaru can't ignore this because he doesn't want gukesh to open up the position uh so he plays G6 and now the H Pawn is stuck in the way all right so now white plays Bishop E3 and Hikaru does exactly what every good nimso Indian player does in a closed position he goes for White's weakness Knight A5 he's going for C4 he's basically saying look one of two things is gonna happen number one I lose because I get checkmated which can happen white can start a massive attack number two I don't get mated I win because I'm just gonna win the pawn on C4 then I'm gonna chop all this down then I'm gonna attack on the C file and then we're gonna go here and then we're gonna hit the rook and then hit this and then take the juicer and then we're gonna go here and then here okay like you know that's what's going through hikaru's head at any given moment um so gukesh needs to somehow give mate right well Hikaru takes on D4 and takes on D4 back and now there's a fork and he takes on D right so he won a pawn and he traded a few pieces now he's gonna have to give up that pawn which he does but now he goes for a queen trade with no Queens on the board kukesh isn't gonna mate anybody and we know Queens on the board gukash is gonna have a much harder time defending his position against hikaru's counter play so Hikaru just wins The Pawn on C4 just effortless technique here he's like gukesh wants to attack me but I'm like the god of defense like literally I don't think there's a better defender on the planet than Hikaru I mean you can argue Magnus but so your car was like all right D5 all right you coming forward let's trade and that's it I mean Hikaru just has an extra Pawn just to clean extra Pawn against gukesh Rook C4 Rook C8 and breaking out with his Pawn I mean he just makes it look completely effortless and he's not rushing the exchanges hikaru's keeping the Rooks exactly where they are because he wants to trade on his terms he either wants to get the rook in or combine his pawns together so we have takes King F7 also very expertly done he doesn't just recapture he takes an opportunity to get his King closer to the action Rook stays active Knight C5 stays active and look at Hikaru just not even taking this back Rook A4 attacking the pawn and now Hikaru trades and it's very clean he just gets two on zero which is completely winning you don't need two on one or one on zero you get two on zero glucass tries his best there's nothing Hikaru deflects the Knight look at that deflecting the Knight via sacrifice to try to promote his Pawn lukesh comes back but that's it here come he corresponds and you will not stop them before Knight C5 that's it and he made it look effortless just completely completely effortless did Hikaru and Hikaru knocked out gukesh I mean Hikaru really just like I mean he plays these games where people get aggressive with him and sometimes he's like really with me Ah that's really adorable that you thought you ever had a chance I mean he just he he's so good at defending it's unbelievable him and Magnus compared to some of these players like uh especially in rabbit and Blitz it's really I mean it's just really exceptional stuff um so so Hikaru and Magnus are first to uh advance but two more epic games so farouja aragaisi is another matchup in uh group a for people that don't know alireza farouza is a superstar youngest player to cross 2800 haven't seen a lot of him recently his opponent is the uh amazing player from India Eric icy absolute Beast match-up young guys going to battle aggressive setup by farugia before and uh aggressive setup from Eric icy striking back in the center with D5 big tension in the center taking on e4 and this one got off to a very hostile start Eric I see in this position was like yo firuja nice King bro Knight H5 my ideas include this F5 F4 G5 G4 and if you go here to stop my knight from coming here well then my ideas involve Bishop H3 also long walks on the beach all right so now I got all this Perugia was like I don't like that Eric icy was like yeah but I like that and now we're gonna put something else on G4 all right Queen E2 Bishop slides back pinning the Knight to the queen now Knight C4 looking to either take or attack the queen or come back so Bishop D6 King to G2 and now Eric icy lashes out with B5 now in this position I cannot really understand for the life of me why faruja did not play Knight E3 I thought that was the entire idea to try to get the bishop I figured something like this I figure King H1 and then he would continue to pressure this however faroosh is a better player than me so I'm gonna trust him that he put his Knight over there and he just went to take that pawn but Rook B8 came and then he didn't take the pawn so now his Knight is stuck now every guy she plays Knight E7 simultaneously defending the pawn and trying to rotate over here to get another piece to the party Queen C8 back and now faruga played F4 and just like in the other game that you saw where uh Hikaru got attacked and went you attacking me Eric guys he looked at this and went you're attacking me I I don't think you understand the situation here H6 night back Pawn takes F4 you you think I'm supposed to be afraid of you check and watch how effortlessly this attack rolls forward Queen to G4 threatens mate and also threatens to take the pawn Queen F4 now I imagine ferrugia thought that maybe he had some sort of counter play here he he doesn't black just has Knight G4 but it goes from bad to worse because look at this move from Eric icy nitage I mean good Lord do you understand the point of that move no Queen F4 Knight F2 smothered mate smothered mate with the bishop patrolling the king's I mean come on what are we even looking at here Queen goes back to E2 this man Eric bro I mean are you kidding me are you kidding me smothered mate and a fork pork is worse than smothered mate but I mean come on Queen E4 Bishop C1 and Eric Icy not only defeated farugia in emphatic fashion in this game every guy see swept ferrugia he beat him three nil what what that's not supposed to happen yeah now the fourth person to qualify to the semis was Wesley so he did it against Ralph mamidov uh three draws in a win for Wesley a solid match a very back and forth match so tomorrow we have Magnus versus arag I see we have Hikaru versus Wesley so which is a rematch of the semi-final in the cgc the Champions chess uh I mean not the Champions chess tour the global Championship are any by the way tell me in the comments is anybody confused ever I'm getting confused and I'm a chess professional I cannot imagine what you're feeling all right we got World Championship World Fisher random Championship World rapid and Blitz Championship the speed Chess Championship we got uh the chess.com Global Championship we got the championship why is everybody a champion damn it all right how about no one's a champion I'm confused I don't even know what's going on anymore and I've played chess for 20 years I can't imagine someone coming into chess six months ago why is everybody a champion I don't I don't know really I I can't explain it um I have one last game to show you all right it's gonna be a little dessert game for those of you that stuck around uh this game is brilliant this is from division two and you know that's insane that division two has players like salaam Saleh number one player from the UAE and Vladimir kramnik who is a multiple time world champion uh and uh a beast I mean he paved uh a tremendous amount of Chess Theory really just an absolute chess legend or I mean arguable top five player of all time but in my opinion a top 10 player of all time for sure so this game was wild it was a bozo Indian just kidding it's called a BOGO Indian but bozo is significantly funnier to say A3 this line where black trades and then secures control of the center take take Bishop B7 very very easy position to play with black but why does the touch better take take Rook D1 select takes the file and uh we have uh Queen C7 like this and now let's bring the Rooks and kramek plays Knight A4 Knight A4 attacks the pawn on B2 um now black is a very cool idea which is this and if you take this it's actually surprisingly hard to get out the computer tries to find a way to trap the Knight so that does it this way though kramnik takes on F3 trying to deflect the queen away from the defense of the bishop but that actually doesn't work because of that now kramnik saw that so he played this move and now that pawn is basically all but lost and the point is that if you push it I'm now getting very quick counter play with my Knights so very nice idea here from kramnik the problem is that Saleh is like a bowling ball rolling downhill so what that means is if you let Salem get any speed there is a reason he is known as the Arabic Falcon and yes it's that that is his chess.com username like he is the self-appointed Arabic Falcon but he when he picks up any sort of momentum he will demolish you so it is no surprise that in this position as kramnik was dancing in with the knights and trying to get the bishop and playing Knight D3 selectraded and then he played Rook C4 and kramnik played F5 gluing his Knight in right but all of a sudden celeb played Rook C7 and it was very clear that he had very bad intentions for kramnik he was going to play all sorts of attacking things and kramnikir had an option to take a step back secure the position you know if Rook takes A7 is played you have Queen B8 trapping The Rook which is just absolute bogus that you can trap The Rook with a king I mean it's just nuts so kramnik got into the position but when you fight the falcon with a falcon or you fight the fire with fire or whatever it is you best be prepared because Here Comes Queen H5 and here comes Rook C2 deflecting the queen and you can repeat moves here for a moment but kramnik grabs the pawn and Salem Salah on corks the queen no longer defends G7 which is important because in this position sacrificed say it with me say it with your chest seven Rook takes G7 and the point is that you bring in your other Rook if the King goes back it's mate but I think what kramnik overlooked is that in this position white plays not a check but F4 upon move is death to the black king just F4 what's the point the King has no legal moves I threaten Bishop H4 oops I threatened Bishop H4 I threatened Queen H6 I threatened Queen G5 if the Knight moves I threaten everything and that's it black just cannot survive there are absolutely there's no way to survive this position and the game is over brutal absolutely brutal um now uh division B is a mess there's like 60 players in it I will keep you posted on the Champions chess tour uh there is a bracket in the description for you to follow along tomorrow we will see the semi-finals of the top group if you see any notable games let me know in the comments and I will cover them because there's like 100 games going on every day so really I have no idea what I'm even supposed to look for but I'll do my best Champions Tour is back Magnus is back Hikaru is back your favorite players are back and uh your uh your favorite Recaps are back too so I'll see you all tomorrow now get out of here
