hello everyone and welcome 702 horsepower 0 to 60 in 4.5 seconds quarter mile in 12.9 seconds and a top speed of 118 miles per hour now that last number reminds us we're not talking about a sports car this is a full-size pickup truck the ram 1500 trx is for the hyper niche truck buyer who instead of having concerns for silly things like payload or tow ratings you know truck things is more concerned about quarter mile trap speeds in this case 108 miles per hour according to ram it's the quickest fastest and most powerful mass-produced truck in the world so in this video we're going to check out the clever engineering that has gone into it how it may dominate the ford raptor and perhaps throw in a few bad jokes to keep our spirits high if you're wondering if dodge ram and the likes of chrysler have run out of ideas well the answer is no because they still haven't fit the hellcat engine into their entire lineup to recap we have a hellcat challenger charger grand cherokee and durango i know we're all patiently awaiting news of the pacifica but in the meantime the good news is the mission of hellcatting all the things draws closer to success with the launch of the ram trx trx say it fast trx you get the idea they're going for t-rex here a dominating dinosaur that made raptors look silly by comparison i'll be referring to the truck as the t-rex for the remainder of the video so regarding the engine under the hood is yes the beautiful 6.2 liter supercharged v8 you've come to love from the hellcat lineup it winds it roars it produces 702 horsepower and 650 pound-feet of torque in the t-rex and the engine is ready to be pushed with a cast iron block forged steel crankshaft powder forged connecting rods and forged alloy pistons some changes versus the other hellcats include a deep sump oil pan to keep the pickup tube in the oil under high g cornering and the alternator has been moved higher to allow for 32 inches of water fording something you probably shouldn't try in the challenger hellcat the air entering the engine comes from two locations half of it is fed through the functional hood scoop and the other half from a ram air intake at the front of the grill did you catch that ram air ram yeah you heard it the first time oh great okay well if you have a big pickup truck with a big engine making big power out in a desert environment well you're going to need some serious filtering that's why the ram t-rex has not just one but two air filters each measuring about 8 by 12 inches now everyone knows the true benchmark the pinnacle of off-road baja performance is the 2016 subaru crosstrek found in my garage and yet the subaru crosstrek only has a single air filter embarrassing with about a seven inch by seven inch area only 49 square inches whatever that unit means in the ram t-rex's press release they specifically state it has quote heavy-duty air filters that provide 198.4 square inches of filter surface area four times the dust trapping capacity when compared to the closest competitor okay let's do some quick math four times the closest competitor so 198.4 divided by four which just so happens to nearly perfectly match the crosstrek's filtration area as i suspected subaru crosstrek is the closest competitor confirmed folks it's just math the air box is mounted up top helping allow for that high water forwarding depth in addition to providing easy access for the owner to clean out the filter elements ram states based on industry standard tests the t-rex can ingest dirty air and debris longer than any competitor before performance begins to diminish here's a bonkers fact about how much heat this engine has to reject from the intake charge at wide open throttle the intercooler is rejecting 40 kilowatts of heat all of this heat just from the intake air alone to give you perspective this is a home space heater at peak power it dumps 1.5 kilowatts of heat into your room now imagine if you had 26 of these space heaters in your room that's how much heat the intercooler is rejecting pulling this energy out of the intake charge to cool it down while at wide open throttle now let's move on to cooling because if you have a big heavy truck with a massive engine making 700 horsepower well combustion engines aren't really all that efficient so substantial cooling is required in a typical gasoline combustion engine about a third of the fuel's energy goes out the exhaust about a third of the energy is lost as heat in the cooling system and then you have about a third left over which in this case is about 700 horsepower our useful power which is left over and then has to make its way through your drivetrain to power the wheels so you need a beefy cooling system here for comparison the shelby gt500 with its 760 horsepower 5.2 liter v8 has a cooling system capable of 230 kilowatts of heat rejection or about 300 horsepower that doesn't mean the engine can't make more than 230 kilowatts of waste heat but even track driving where you're often at wide open throttle there are plenty of times where you're braking or going through corners where the cooling system catches back up okay all of this is to say the jumbo ram dinosaur needs a jumbo radiator with an abundance of airflow to keep things cool or you know just keep forwarding through 32 inches of water now here's where we find ourselves in a bit of a pickle the engineer wants there to be plenty of airflow through the front of the truck the marketing team knows that the real appeal of a truck is ensuring that everyone around you knows what brand of truck you bought by sticking as large as possible letters spelling it out for you r a m ram great spelling jerry it needs to be big bigger even bigger come on this is a t-rex not a raptor so they make the letters really big but then uh oh the big letters block all of the airflow so what do you do simple cut some holes in those letters so that air can still flow through and folks can still know you spent tremendous coin on a super fast truck but it won't overheat and bumper to bumper traffic on the highway while f-150 drivers timidly look in their rearview mirrors as far as the four-wheel drive system there's an active transfer case which has a low range with 2.641 gearing and the transfer case will vary the torque split depending on which mode you're in auto sport snow tow mud and baja torque is sent to the front rear differentials and in the rear is an electronic locking diff paired with a dana 60 solid rear axle with full floating shafts from the differentials we move out to the wheels which you can option bead lock wheels from the factory instead of relying on the air pressure to keep the tire in place this uses screws to clamp the tire in place in off-roading scenarios it is often beneficial to decrease tire pressures but if you go too low on tire pressure you can risk the tire bead slipping or worse coming off the wheel the bead lock ensures the tire stays mounted and doesn't slip relative to the wheel's position in this case there's a 35 inch tire at each corner t-rex exclusive goodyear wrangler territory all terrains and 325 over 65 r18 of course another massive piece of off-roading comes down to the suspension the t-rex has over 13 inches of wheel travel in both the front and the rear up front is an independent active suspension with forged aluminum upper and lower control arms designed to maintain the appropriate camera angles during their long travel there are massive 2.5 inch wide bilstein adaptive dampers in both the front and the rear which use a single piece aluminum construction with machined cooling fins for heat dissipation and the rear is a 5 link coil suspension that allows for the solid axle to travel up to 13 inches but look i know why you're really watching this video and i know what excessively fast truck customers are actually interested in fuel economy that's why ram says quote the use of lightweight high-strength aluminum closures including the doors hood and tailgate help reduce weight and boost fuel economy this truck is massive 8 inches wider than the rebel with fatter tires and it sits significantly taller the standard ram 1500 4x4 with a v8 is getting 15 mile per gallon city 22 mile per gallon highway so what is this 700 horsepower truck getting oh conveniently there are not any current estimates released to ram's credit they do provide that it has a drag coefficient of 0.489 now for context i wanted to know if 0.489 was good for tyrannosaurus rex and after reviewing a study published in innovative biosystems and bioengineering which analyzed the t-rex's running efficiency they found quote the air drag in t-rex running can be neglected this is excellent news for ram with negligible air resistance we'll all patiently await the release of impressive fuel economy specifications speaking of specifications pairing the t-rex side by side with the ford raptor it's pretty obvious what they were benchmarking many of the stats line up near perfectly with the t-rex having several very slight advantages the most notable difference really is the power 252 more horsepower and 140 more pound-feet of torque versus the raptor from a specification standpoint looking at the numbers doesn't really reveal that the t-rex would dominate the raptor in any off-roading scenario that aren't about outright speed the raptor is also likely to weigh less than the t-rex we don't know what the t-rex's weight is yet but the hellcat durango weighs about the same as the ford raptor so i imagine the t-rex will be more but here's the most worrying news for the t-rex it's currently pitting itself against a ford raptor which was released in 2017 and its single largest advantage over the current generation raptor is horsepower but according to car and driver multiple sources within ford told them there will be a special version of the raptor fit with a 5.2 liter supercharged v8 found in the shelby gt500 in the shelby it's making 760 horsepower so while the t-rex will likely dominate the current spec raptor it sounds like there may be an asteroid hurling towards it to end its reign now is there any legitimate reason to own a 700 horsepower baja thrashing pickup truck well i can't say no as i'd be hypocritically overlooking my emotional impulse buy of the 2016 subaru crosstrek which again has over 147 horsepower words like quickest fastest and most powerful are words i live by on a daily basis that's why i've renamed my ride after the largest carnivore to ever exist on this planet the biggest the baddest the kind of speed only a crosstrek can match the blue whale if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below thanks for watching
