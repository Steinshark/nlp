ladies and gentlemen welcome back to Tata steel 2023 it is the penultimate round of action uh round 12 out of 13 and things are really heating up in today's recap video I am going to show you four games of Chess that stockfish the strongest computer in the world probably looked at and smiled as humans and computers merge closer and closer together uh to form the perfect chess entity or cyborg if you will there will be a Magnus uh Carlson game uh and there will be other great games as well every game today just featured incredible nuances and elements that I'm gonna try to break down for you right that's sort of my job here your job is to you know rate my uh stairs out of ten and as I said at 3 million subscribers I maybe I'll explain this there to you but we're not there yet so without further Ado it is a matchup of number one and number two in the Netherlands it's basically Barcelona versus Real Madrid I don't know which one is which in this case and Jordan plays the move d4 uh Knight F6 C4 my speakers are really loud E6 and D5 and Jordan already plays a weird move he plays Pawn takes D5 which to some of you might just be like I don't understand why that's a weird move um because normally white at least keeps the tension for a little bit but Jordan just basically plays an exchange uh a Queen's Gambit decline Exchange no tension in the center nothing now Anish plays this Anish could have played whatever he could have played Bishop E7 Bishop D6 C6 whatever um but he plays it in what's called a regosan move order basically what that means because everything in chess has a name that probably confuses you this is the ragosan and here white can do this and that's basically what white did in the game uh and then played Bishop F4 now Anish got very aggressive in this game attacking the the Knight like this and then Knight C6 and from this point forward Jordan played 20 moves of top stockfish move in a row he had this prepared meaning he knew all the best moves he knew all the pitfalls he knew all the tricks and he made a niche walk through a field of explosives like it so first he played H4 like if your opponent in the middle of an opening plays H4 bad bad news unless you're like below 1200 like you know you got you guys know what I'm talking about you watch a video on YouTube of you know the some Danish Gambit and then you sit down and this is what you get right and you're losing 15 moves to go chess is horrible I hate it I understand um at this level when this happens the guy with black ghost oh God here we go again so he develops his Bishop and something very funny happens here Anish place takes takes Bishop A3 now if you move the Rook to C2 or B1 black takes if you move the Rook to A1 Black traps The Rook so what the heck has Jordan done Bishop A3 is going to lose the Rook bro your plays Rook B1 Aaron's a cultured man he watches Gotham he knows about the Rook B1 meme the people who know about the staring meme might not know about the Rook B1 meme Rook B1 and he just gives up the rook and he he really just gonna act like this is normal chest right this is yeah okay now he plays Queen B3 attacks the bishop Anish comes back and Anish could have tried to defend everything like this but he decides to trade the Bishops and tries to trade the queens and Jordan just plays check and comes back so far Jordan has played 18 top engine Moves Like Jordan deliberately did all of this Knight D5 attacks the Knight invites the knight in C5 Pawn chain blocks the queen from coming back sacrifices this pawn and castles and now plays H5 at this point Jordan is on his own it only took Jordan 23 moves to not have anything in his memory and anich blunders immediately now Knight G5 is a very strong attack and in this position white is actually completely winning uh White has a winning move so Jordan just beautiful play thus far and apparently the move Rook C1 here is winning for white uh the point is that you attack the Knight if the Knight just tries to walk out uh you take on C5 I believe attacking the rook and then here you have Bishop F7 and various attacking ideas to get in with the queen and uh slowly stockfish just balloons its Advantage but instead of that Jordan plays all this engine prep and then does this and Jordan allows Anish to kind of get back into the game but the attack is still extremely potent look at anisha's Rooks desperately defending the king have you ever seen Rooks reduce to such a role now we have Knight back to B2 in this position Jordan had another winning idea according to the computer uh which was nothing short of again if Jordan had played this stockfish would have had an aneurysm uh Knight takes F7 okay Rook F7 and now the only winning move for white try to find it you won't unless you're cheating the only winning move here for white is King H2 it's King H2 you know what the idea of King H2 is the fact that black has no moves you get out of the check of Queen and Knight anywhere and then you just go Queen D4 all right you caught off the king Rook F3 Rook G3 that's it Queen T4 and and so on that's it King H2 was yeah shut up stockfish Jordan doesn't find that which is why stockfish was also smiling because while humans can try to be like engines they never will be and this game actually becomes an extremely weird end game where over the next 30 moves Jordan advances his pawns forward like a gazelle running through the fields look at Jordan's pawns go they fly forward majestically but Anish does have them blocked and Anish has a pawn of his own and while Jordan tries to break through anisha's Pawn makes it all the way down to A2 where it's a permanent problem and even though Jordan has this massive Pawn wall he can't break through it's very close it ends up going 80 moves but has all good things that have to do with stockfish it comes to an end with Jordan allowing a niche sorry Anish allowing Jordan to make a queen and it's just a draw the king is stuck you're not gonna go there because Queen and black is going to win so King D3 and the players repeat moves in a ridiculous just I mean not all draws are the same they're not all right I mean they're not you know if your two favorite football teams played against each other in Premier League it was 3-3 would you be disappointed I don't know maybe you would be I mean if you're like a you know Tottenham fan you're probably always disappointed uh I don't know is that like a good joke um now the next game that I have for you is uh this one I like this game for two reasons number one it was also an example of ridiculous engine play by Parham and number two he played my prep now I didn't give him this prep uh but uh yeah he played my prep so it was a grunfeld and H3 played this I have played this this this this this this this castles are C5 it doesn't really matter H3 the point is that you prevent Bishop G4 which is a very common move to apply pressure to the white position and there is this line when we get the exact same position in the game there was this line where black does this comes forward with the queen like this and I when I was looking at this game he played my line D5 is my prep to sacrifice this Rook it's not really capturable because the counter attack on the dark squares is too much um but I've actually had this exact position which was so funny to me I was like oh my god um and Rook B1 is a move here sacrificing the A2 Pawn preventing this Bishop from moving with pressure uh but this is also a line and I'm pretty sure my prep here was not Queen E1 which is what Parham played but rather Queen C1 was my notes and then it's like this this this this this this is some insane line where like you play Rook B7 and white is a little bit better this is my prep now clearly Parham has something else prepared and yes at at the international Master Level you need to prepare 20 moves and memorize everything I mean it's ridiculous you guys can just four move Checkmate your opponents um Knight T3 takes takes and basically this position is just asking black a bunch of questions like how are you gonna defend your pawns how are you going to defend your pieces how are you going to defend your queen which is now trapped in my you could take this Pawn rookie one G4 sacrificing a knight because you trapped the queen oh my God oh my God Queen C8 back in this game I think Parham had literally 20 something moves of prep also 20 moves memorized to get to this position which of course stockfish just sits there and says it's equal it's anything but equal for a human white has a pawn literally just two squares away from becoming a queen black is desperately hanging on white also can create an attack on the king at any moment Knight G5 Queen F4 Queen F7 H4 H5 H6 right Parham plays Knight G5 trades and there we go I mean he's doing exactly that though his Queen side he does not care about he Chucks the whole Queen side but Eric icy is also asking questions over here essentially this game is going to come down to a razor thin margin look at this ridiculous move Rook C4 disconnecting the queen from the defense of the king defended black now has to kick out a window for his pieces and finally after 30 moves of play Arjun succumbs to the pressure he had to play F6 inviting the knight in and then Bishop B5 attacking The Rook but it looks like The Rook the root can be taken because of D7 it can though apparently there is Knight G7 Queen C4 take take here King F7 and this holds this position is holding for black because you're gonna promote I mean this is just Insanity complete Insanity Rook C4 Arjun tries to save his King by kicking out a window but Parham arrives with two pawns and uh the attack Roars forward now I think the best move might have been Knight E4 but it's like very close F6 F7 hello oh my goodness stockfish is sitting on top of its Throne like oh my God this is amazing these peasants are just fighting to the death it's like Game of Thrones House of the Dragon you know just watching the Gladiators go two Queens on the board for a brief moment even though both of them can literally be captured so which one do you capture you take this one okay Queen F7 and let's not forget I might make a third Queen Barham might literally promote twice all right Bishop E8 sacrificing the bishop to deflect the queen from The Rook but the queen just comes back you could push I'm also gonna push and the thing is when you take I come right back and you can't do this because Rook H4 so black goes here and tries to sacrifice cold-blooded move here by Parham not walking out into the danger zone King H2 and he was probably slid King H2 over pressed the clock and look at Arjun and was like check me now and Arjun was like okay but here's the difference now I can take and now there's no Queen H1 check parham's Rook survives and all Parham has to do is grab one of these pawns and make sure it doesn't promote and he goes in Rook C5 that's it Arjun resigns his last Pawn is gonna fall the last dangerous Pawn what a game I mean what is this position after F6 what look at this this is insanity complete Insanity I mean the pawns Kings wide open all right there is no there's no Rhyme or Reason to any of these games totally crazy stuff the Magnus game today was Unreal also so Magnus uh took his young opponent out of prep early and by the way Prague recently you know went like other worldly levels of viral in India because he drank out of a flower vase just kidding that was me um but he did go viral Prague for uh for being the youngest player to beat Magnus and then he did it again actually so Magnus knows that his opponent is a very good calculator and his opponent plays in a very provocative way putting six pawns on light squares now all right quiz uh little bit of a quiz for the chess beginners who might be watching if a person has six out of six pawns on light squares which of their Bishops is the bad Bishop the one that's on the same color as all the others right so the light squared Bishop can't really move you'd be happy trading that Bishop whereas your dark squared Bishop needs to stay on the board and needs to be the anchor because if so many pawns are on light squares it means the dark squares are like swiss cheese some of you might be lactose intolerant so you might not even like swiss cheese Bishop E4 97 and actually in this game Magnus trades and gets a very very imbalanced position early of horses versus pointed hats all right Knights love a closed position and this is kind of a closed position it's very locked in the center and Magnus wants to get a pawn like going like this like if Magnus can get a pawn to F5 the game is probably over that's it all it takes because then you get an id5 F6 and you just get into the position okay um he plays rookie three Bishop F5 and now Magnus plays a a brilliant and classy move it's a very high level move here it doesn't just Brute Force no no no no no he undevelops his Queen putting it back on its home Square why because now the queen can join the action on two different diagonals whereas on the original Square even though it had already been developed it couldn't partake in the action remember in chess sometimes we mirror life sometimes you need to take one step back to enrich your further opportunities your future opportunities and take two steps forward and a couple moves later he will begin this F4 operation uh and he still can begin this F4 operation but in this position Magnus misses a win in one move okay it's not really a Miss in one move it's like a missing two prog just absent-mindedly moved his Rook to the e-file that's only protected by the king you can actually take it you could just take it if I take your Rook this if I don't take you you just come back but if this very simple pin just pin you defend I attack you cannot take me you defend I attack Magnus is winning Knight F7 wins on the spot and I got news for you at this level of the game it is not too complex of a tactic and after the game they actually asked Magnus about this and he went oh my God wait I saw that and I just forgot about it and he was mad he was upset like Magnus didn't misevaluated or like there was no you know sometimes we see something that a player misses and maybe the guy you know tells you well after Queen D7 Knight E5 I saw that there's rookie five and then there's a fork so take take and D4 I thought black is getting counter play no he just straight up didn't he just forgot about Knight F7 they both did so Magnus just misses an opportunity to win the game that's crazy we almost never see that Bishop E6 Knight A4 and he starts to attack on the queen side all right Rook B8 Knight comes back Prague Fights Back Queen A5 Bishop G4 targeting the queen he can't take Queen takes Rook comes back check and now things get ridiculous rookie 4 attacks the pawn you have to take the Knight and I take the the bishop and now I'm threatening to take the Rook you've gotta move the Rook cause it's hanging because if I take it it's check and you lose but in this position the teenage Superstar from India who has already defeated Magnus Carlsen twice in the last year played the absolutely breathtaking Sensational defensive move C2 Take a Bow this is brilliant this is fearless the point is you let the goat take your Rook with check you sacrifice The Rook if you will and you are guaranteed a promotion you know why because he can't do anything about it Magnus plays F4 and F5 trying to Checkmate Prague we have three queens on the board Queen C7 only move to defend this and escape with the King progress will move away from getting mated but he's safe this is nuts Queen f8 is Checkmate on the next move and Prague finds a queen sacrifice to Fork check and he's gonna make a draw Magnus avoids the draw and turns the game into a queen end game so Magnus is now going to enter the next phase of the game which is trying to make a queen Prague needs to safeguard his King and uses g-pawn it's his most advanced Pawn he's gonna lose the queen Side Pawn for sure Magnus meanwhile is gonna sacrifice the house he lost all those Pawns he's just going for it B5 this is nuts it's gonna come down to the last Pawn ba one square away from promotion for Magnus but the queen drops back and look at this this is the power of the queen it stands bulletproof stopping all this and you can't go and sneak in because my Pawn is a problem too it monitors the complete opposite side of the board it's nuts and ultimately it takes about 65-67 moves but we get another promotion and then another promotion I mean we've seen like 10 new Queens in this video and the game ultimately ends in a draw because there's no say there's no shelter for the white king anymore and it will just you know could go on another 50 moves 150 moves probably but what a battle I mean really what a battle I not all draws are the same now if you had the patience to survive 20 minutes you're about to witness the worst best chess game I've ever seen I have various series on my YouTube channel I guess the ELO where I predict your ratings based on your games or I show a game played by two three hundreds Max barmer Dom is the kid who consistently gets called to the principal's office but on the chessboard all right he is playing against prague's sister by the way vaishali Ramesh Babu uh here we go so it's a normal opening it's in English it's a reverse grunfeld style H4 that's how you know we're about to have some fun now vaishali could respond and not let the kid do anything right just don't don't let them have any fun unfortunately she lets him have a little bit too much fun he moves the pawn all the way to H6 the thing is though that that's that's not really a problem right yeah unfortunately when there's one sign of deviance there's going to be more Knight h what the bishop now asks the Knight what it's going to do and E4 NG oh my no way right you know what max volume played now he played Knight of cup bro what what this is a grand master this is like the fourth highest rated player in the entire Netherlands maybe fifth kids watching he puts the knight in the center now Rook fd8 I mean she's just trying to take advantage of the fact that like he's not developing any pieces bro he goes Bishop A3 attacking the pawn right she could defend it but she's like Rooks he's not gonna take the pawn if he takes the pawn I have like all sorts of bro he just takes the pawn he's not castling he's got no pawns out except that one which by the way is a pretty big guy and then he just comes back nothing Knight comes out 25 I mean by Charlie's all her pieces are out staring at the white position and yet you can't do anything now what does a person do when they have like just barely any development well they gotta catch up in development right not Max he goes Knight D5 And Trades off his only active piece and then this me I'm not yo this man played this it is the 20th move of the game five out of six of his pieces are bear are on home squares one has made one move what is this how can you get away with playing chess like this here's how D3 Queen C2 Queen B2 Bishop comes out blocking The Rook Pawn comes out activating the queen Rook comes the point of Rook H4 is that he's just gonna take take Queen F6 mate don't believe me let me show you just Castle sack this Rook Queen F6 Knight F5 Stomps made on G7 but it's just a matter of time he just goes here it's just a matter of time Bishop takes F5 you can take F3 not the most accurate move the computer would have preferred some weird like it saw like Bishop F3 he could have he could have trapped the queen which is kind of funny but okay F3 here Bishop F5 and I mean the the game is just it's just over it he didn't have to go to an end game he could have just played Bishop it doesn't matter and he just it's two Bishops versus The Rook which you're just gonna win two Bishops versus The Rook this Pawn constantly makes sure that the king can't move in H7 is a problem Bishop F4 Bishop B7 and uh yeah we go down to this end game but this is a totally winning position for white you know why C5 the Pawn's just going it's just gonna go between C6 C7 C8 and the collapse of this pawn and this it's over and Visalia just resigns Rook D5 is impossible she cannot stop everything folks I this is the position on move 19. I mean are you kidding me what people get away with this I don't know I'm telling you somewhere stockfish is watching this recap going wow wow this is like incredible stuff they're playing Just Like Me tomorrow we finish uh Tata steel and uh we can get back to making uh other videos thankfully and um yeah if you want to check out the standings there's a link in the description you just have to click the link and then on the top you can go to results and standings for Challengers and for Masters I'll see you tomorrow get out of here
