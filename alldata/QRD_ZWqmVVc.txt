this is your last chance only 24 hours left to lock in your investment into the biggest grifter on the planet that's right ladies and gentlemen today we're talking about the con that continues the Griff that keeps giving the piss punch bowl himself Mr Brian Rose of London real now Brian's full history is way too long to explain here I have a whole series documenting this man's long resume everything from mayor candidate to bitcoin bro to free speech Warrior that last one being particularly funny because his comment section is more censored than North Korean Wi-Fi but anyways I recently hit my two year anniversary of covering Brian and I realized I can't stop now so even though London reel's views have dipped like a real historian I have to continue documenting so without further Ado here's the most recent chapter Brian Rose is selling his YouTube channel how would you like to own part of London reel as an equity investor and join us on our Incredible Journey of expansion as we transform the lives of the next one billion people on the planet with our groundbreaking broadcast interviews Innovative Online Academy supercharged Live Events and forward-looking blockchain strategy well stay tuned and I will show you how to partake in this once in a lifetime opportunity now look when I first found out about this once in a lifetime opportunity I was actually too late somehow I had missed the 27 emails he sent me asking me to invest and when I found out it was already over my last chance for financial Independence had passed me by so imagine my shock when Brian extended the deadline 24 hours just for me I have to admit I also missed that one but then he did it again with a limited extension opportunity which I felt was a bit strange because as much as I appreciate so many once in a lifetime opportunities I couldn't help but think it didn't square with what Brian said was happening with these shares flying off the shelves this is the last day to buy your shares in London rail we are closing this process out so you're not going to have to get any more emails from me or hear any more messages thank you for sparing me and uh it's just nuts over the studio the shares are flying yeah my favorite part of this whole video is that the comment section is a ghost town for such an exciting event I mean these are all the comments on that whole video and the most liked one is why is he looking left to right is he hunted by someone which the answer to that is um probably yes he's looking for all the investors of the digital Freedom platform uh to see if they want their money back now of course we know Brian isn't the first person to try to sell his YouTube channel as a way to make money a few weeks ago we covered the channel disrupt selling a fraction of their channel for an insane valuation like 10 million dollars so I wanted to know how does London real stack up against that in terms of delusion well I went to their website and found out they're trying to raise 1 million pounds at a pre-money valuation of 14.5 million dollars or sorry pounds we're in London land which is just insane I mean this channel barely pulls in a few thousand views per video and they want you to believe that they're this multi-multi-multi-million pound organization but of course that's why we need to talk about their road map for Success see Brian has a three-phase process which will make everything make sense see phase one he's going to launch a London reel crypto token phase two he's gonna sell his top 10 episodes as nfts and part of phase three is selling his top 50 episodes as nfts truly groundbreaking stuff and all of this is supposed to generate Revenue that looks like a Bitcoin hopium chart I mean the line just goes up according to their projections they think Lenin real will make 25 million pounds by 2027. just like I will be in the 25 million dollar studio now even if this miracle happens it's not really clear how much you'll actually benefit from this profit because the investor perk section is a bit vague as to what you'd be entitled to receive it says you'll get things like a live stream a share certificate for the amount you invest but then at the bottom it says you'll get a chance to share in the future profits I mean what do you mean a chance I don't want a chance I want the profits right if you're investing in this company I mean is am I buying a scratch off lottery ticket and look maybe some of you feel like I'm splitting hairs here but this is the exact kind of language that lawyers use to screw people out all the time like oh we didn't say you'd get future profits we said you'd get a chance for future profits and so I wanted to look further into this and so I read their like Financial pitch and they say that their plan is to pay dividends based on achieving standard profitability criteria now what exactly that means is not really clear I couldn't find it out it sounds like they need to make a certain amount of money uh before you make any money which given their projections seems like they won't be hitting it but either way I just found this whole thing strange like London reel's Business is already about selling to London real fans but then participating in the business is also selling to London reel fans like this is in the pitch deck their whole funnel system of you know look we're a profitable business look how we get all these upsell customers but you're kind of upselling people on investing into the business right so are you a business partner or are you the business if you invest in this thing I think the reason londonreal has taken such a hit views wise and credibility wise it's just kind of because people are so tired of being constantly sold things I mean I can remember a time years ago where London rail was a channel where you could find interesting people you know talking about interesting things and maybe you still can but the amount of grips that had been started since the vid took over in 2020 it's just ruined the channel honestly you have London real courses you have the freedom platform donation tribe the Brian for mayor donation Drive the crypto Academy the equity fundraiser donation Drive is just always an excuse to need more money wait hold on I just got a new email the London real crowdfunding campaign is being extended again
