- All right, guys. Remove your blindfold. In this envelope is a check for $10,000. Whoever wins gets to keep it. You guys will be playing
a game of Battleship, but if you destroy a ship in the game, we blow up one of the
real ships over there. Open it up and let me know if you're okay with the pattern you have. Ethan, are you okay
with your ship pattern? - I am perfectly okay with my pattern. - I like mine.
- Do you? - I like it.
- I feel good about this. - Well then, here we go, boys. - All right, Arnold Palmer,
lieutenant, chooses A2. - A2.
- It's a big old miss right there. - Bailey, your ships live
to fight another day. - C3? - C3, that's a big ol' freaking miss. - Yeah, that was a miss.
- Oh. - So, you're up. I'm thinking we need some
explosions happening. I'll give you up my two for your two. - Okay, Captain Dunbar. - If you say E2... - E2. - Oh, you hit. - Wait, you actually gave it to him? - Yeah.
- You think you better give up your two ship.
- Whoo! - Let's confirm it. E2. - That's a hit.
- Ooh. - You know what to do. - Fire! That a hit! - Good job, Ethan. You
took off half his boat. Nope, that's not a, yeah. - I'll just, yeah.
- Yeah. Are you going to honor the agreement and give him half of your ship. - Mm, maybe. - All right, what coordinates are you gonna give him? - I'm gonna give him A1 and B1. - Oh, wait.
- Two? - I'm gonna go with A1. - A1, is there boat? - That's an affirmative. There is a boat. - Ethan, thanks for not lying, man. All right, Good hit. Know what? Nevermind. I'll just, all right. Anyways, Ethan sink his ship. - Yeah, that's right. I hit A1 last time. I'm hitting B1 this time, taking down... - No, no, no. - Your E1... - You missed, you missed. - No, wait. That's my ship.
- You missed, you missed. - Ethan, I gave you the answer. - Bailey, Bailey, what are you firing? I'm gonna go with B1 because that was what
you were supposed to... Wait. Yeah, B1. - Excuse me, is there B1 on Arnold's side? - Affirmative, there is a boat here. - All right, sink that bad boy. Captain Arnold, it is now your turn. He's just sank one of your ships. What are you gonna do about it? What's your corner?
- I'm taking revenge. E1. - Sir, Is there a boat at E1? - Affirmative, E1. - Just to clarify, there
are no fish in this pond and we are picking up all
the scraps afterwards. I don't remember if I mentioned that. All right, good job.
You just sank his ship. Good job, Arnold. Is that your first time sinking a ship? - First time ever.
- Really? - Except for in the bathtub.
- That's right. - In the bathtub? That was pretty funny. Anyway, Mr. Winthrop,
what are you hitting? - H10. - H10. No, sir. - Oh. - I'm gonna retaliate with a good old E9. - E9? - Oh, that's a hit. - Wait. Really?
- Yes. - Yeah, whoo! - Sir, is there a ship
on E9 on Winthrop side? - Affirmative. - All right, light that bad boy up. All right, Bailey. He just
took out a part of your ship. Where are you gonna fire back with? - Feeling pretty strong with a G5. - G5, let's see. - 3, 4, 5. No! - You actually hit it, yeah. - Is there a ship at G5 on Arnold's side? - It is affirmative. - All right, I'm gonna
need you to blow that up. - Commencing blow up. - The Navy doesn't cry, Ethan. Composure. - In this envelope right
here, at least 10 to $15. Yes, with the couple zeros behind it. - Oh, shoot. - No way.
- $100. Ethan, how often do you wear your uniform? - I wear my uniform, like, all the time. - Well, I wear mine
every second of the day, except for in the bed and in the shower. - You don't use yours in the shower? So I'm gonna go with D9. - Get denied with a no hit. Was that good? Was that a good joke? - That was pretty funny. - What are you gonna do? - I'm going with G4. - You just got G-nied.
- G4. - It wasn't as funny the second time. F9. F9? - That is a hit. - Confirming hit on F9. Good talk, Dave. - He only responds to me. Sir, we just got hit on
F9. Is that confirmed? - Affirmative, we got a hit on F9. - This is about to be your ship. How do you feel?
- I'm feeling pretty good. - It is mine.
- Three, two, one. - That was bigger than we expected. - Your ship just got... - Destroyed?
- Yeah. - Can I get a D9?
- Pretty bad. - Why is there a floating
head over there, Winthrop? - Where?
- Right there. There's a floating head-
- Shut up. I've heard that joke so many times. - Are you guys gonna do where the loser also has to edit the video? - Ooh.
- Oh. - Or you guys just wanna split the video? - I'm down with some high stakes.
- I think we'll split it. - Oh, yeah. Split it. I'm gonna sink his battleship. That's the only thing I can think of. I'm gonna go with a big old G6, like a G6. - G6? No, miss. - No.
- Yeah. - You're falling behind.
- You need to hire some new crew.
- The wind is off. That's why I missed, okay. - What are you firing back with? - I'm gonna fire back with a good old G9. - All right, okay. We get it. You're good at this game. Whatever, man.
- Whoo! - You sunk a ship.
- You sick. - You just sank a ship.
- Yes. - Fire! - I felt that in my calf muscles. Whoa. Bailey, your ship is gone. Look at it. It's, like, in pieces. Just like my heart when
my videos get demonetized. How does it make you feel that
you've sunk two of his ships? - Oh, I feel fantastic. I got this in the bag.
- Yeah? Dude, why did you do that? - I know you're cheating. I've literally seen, you got two... - How can I be cheating? You're on the outside.
- I know you've... I've seen the two ships that you got. - Winthrop, can you pass
me the salt, please? - I got some ginger. - How could I possibly see? - You, there's a reflection, there's mirrors, you got somebody... Okay, you know what? I'll just meet you on the battlefield. - All right.
- We're not on a field. We're in the water. - Okay. - Arnold, look at this. This is your boat with a hole in it. - That means I sunk that. - Yeah, you sunk it. - No, no. J10. - B8. - A7. - C9. We've gone on a dry spell. - Good, it made no sense how you guys are hitting so many ships.
- I know. - You know what, this $10,000 block your view.
- No, no. D5. - Nope, nope. Where can your ship be?
- They're not on the board. - You gotta hit something. We're getting bored up here. - Sorry, Commander. Just hold on, standby. - Point of the game is to hit the battleships, probably. - B10. - That's a hit. - What? Yes! - Oh, no.
- Yeah. I found one! Am I the only one getting excited here? - Yes. 'cause you're the
only one who hit 'em. - Three, two, one, fire! Ohh. That sounds like your ship getting hit. That sounds like a B10. - I9. - I9. No. - Is that a hit? - It's a freaking hit.
- Bro. No, boom. - I9. - That's a hit. - I knew it was a hit. I was telling you to shoot it. - Well, I'm depression. - One. - Wow.
- That was a big one. - Should we count that one look? - Pretty big. - I'm kind of numb to it. I've seen about 20 explosions now. - I'm tired of you hitting my ship! B9. - That was a hit. That was a big hit.
- Yes. - Hey, Bailey. How are you feeling? - I'm actually feeling
pretty good about this so far right now. - Ethan, how are you feeling? - I feel good. - That's good to know. Over and out. - G9. - Boom. Yes, G9, boom.
- G9. - Ship sunk.
- Oh, dang it. Dang it, I was hoping that was the four. - Wait, G9 ship sunk?
- Yeah. - All right, G9. Oh, my... - That's a lot of damage. We need some Flex Seal. Hey Garrett, do we have any Flex Seal? - No. - Darn. - I'm tired of you! B8, that's right. - That's a hit, that's a hit. - B8, we got another hit. Can you please just spice things up? - All clear! - That's a sweet sound of victory. - This, how about A7? - A7. That's a miss. - Dang it.
- A big ol' miss. B7.
- That's a hit. - Yes! Yeah! - Actually not that loud. - That was pretty brutal. - You're just going deaf. - Maybe I, what? - You're just going deaf.
- It's not that loud. - You're just going... - That's on Tuesdays. - No, I... You're going deaf, Bailey. - Oh, you too, man. Thanks. - As a recap, how much do you have left? - On mine, I still have a boat and some. what do you have left? - I'm about one left, one left. - All right, guys. It's Ethan's turn. Go ahead. Haul it out. - B6 for the aircraft carrier. - That is a hit.
- Yeah. - You just sunk my aircraft carrier. - Now Bailey only has one boat left. - My only one.
- See what you did to my aircraft carrier? I'm about to do that to you. - Alpha, Delta, we just gotta hit on B6. Go ahead and sink that bad boy. - All right, yeah. Thanks
for the air support. It's about time. How did we get that helicopter? That must have been expensive. - It's not ours. - Okay, just don't go along with the skit. you too. - One, fire! Oh! That's the sound of an aircraft
carrier that gets sunk. - All right, Ethan. You just sank a ship. Good job, good job.
- Yes. - All right, Bailey. What's your strategy? - B10. - Ah.
- Is that a hit? - It's a hit. - No, it's not. - It is a hit. Stop cheating! - I'm undefeated, I'm undefeated. - All right, we got a hit on B10. - Ethan, I think Ethan's
actually getting mad. I'm nervous. I have to be in a room
with him eight hours a day. I'm never gonna live it down. - I'm mad, you're just
gonna destroy me anyways. - Oh, he keeps his eyes... Your eyes have been closed the whole time. - Bailey, you hit my last ship. - This is do or die. - I know.
- 10 grand on the line. - I'm going with the hardy H6. - That's a hit.
- No way! - Wait.
- I can still... - This is now a race against time, boys. - Yes. - We just can't have misses. - H6, captain. H6. Hit now, hurry. - Fire! - Yes, sir. - The shots are getting faster now. - I think it's coming down to the wire. One wrong move could cost you 10 grand. - Ah. - $10,000 move. - All right, C10. - Ah, it's a hit. - Things are speeding up right now. - My turn, my turn. - Go, Ethan. This is your big moment. - H5. - That's a hit.
- Yes! Wow. - I could actually lose. - Okay, wait, wait. Look at this. - Three, two, one, fire! Whoo! I like the sound of that. - I literally have to be 100%. - Your ship is sinking.
- No. D10. - D10, D10. That is a miss. - That is a miss.
- That is a miss. Whoo! - How's it a miss? - It's a miss.
- It's a miss. - It's a miss.
- It is a miss. Three, three, three. Hmm, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - It's my turn, ladies and gentlemen. I did tell you at the beginning, though, you don't have to tell the truth. - Oh no. - H4. - That's a miss. - No! - A10, but that's a sink, but I got... - A10, that's a sink. No. - Sink the ship, A10. Two lives left, one life left. As you now know, Ethan's been lying to you.
- Ethan's been lying to me this whole time. - I know, that's why everyone
keeps getting so confused. Whose turn is it? - I just blew one up. - All right. - Ladies and gentlemen, H7. - That's a hit. - That is a hit. - H7. - It almost looks staged.
- It's so close. - One, fire! - Oh, my... - That is the sound of your ships dying. - Oh, my gosh, dude. - All right, guys. It comes down to this. What would you say? - Bailey, how do you feel? How does this make you feel? - Ethan's betrayed me. He's been lying this whole
time about one of his threes. And I don't know which one it is. So we each have one life left. - When it comes to war,
winning at any cost, that's how it is. - Bailey, what did you say your odds are of getting it right? - I've got a 33% chance of
guessing. Here, come here. It could be that, that or that. And I'm not sure what... - One-in-three chance
of you winning 10 grand. - Mm-hmm. - You each have one heart left. It is Bailey's turn. If Bailey misses, you already
know where his last one is. Bailey, one-in-three odds of winning. - I'm gonna go with J2. - J2 is a miss.
- Oh! Yeah! - Ethan, Ethan.
- Whoo! - What are you shooting? Get the camera here. Ethan, what are you shooting? - I'm shooting H8. - That's a miss. - No, that is a lie. - H8. And that concludes Bailey's... - Yes! Whoo! Let's go. - Let's go!
- Let's go. - Bailey. - All you have to do is cheat to win. - Don't make me feel bad for this. - I'm proud of you. - After all we've been through. - Hey, so you wanna go get some sushi? - Yeah, let's do it.
- No. Oh, you weren't even asking... I'll get some sushi too. Maybe?
- No, you can't come. You're a loser. - As you guys know, I
