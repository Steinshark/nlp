today i'm getting a phd from hustler university also known as hustler versity by those of us with the grind set it was created by this guy i'm talk to you you think you're smart i bought this coin and it's going up you could have bought any coin and it went up in the last year the matrix was broken hustlers university is the greatest thing that exists on the face of the planet for people who are trying to escape the matrix become hostage university welcome to the metaverse inject it into your brain you can skip university you can buy my program and i guarantee you you will know everything you need to know have you ever seen a college professor with an s63 and a mclaren and a lambo and aston martin standing next to a porsche no you never seen any of this i know how to make now if you're wondering why i'm enrolling in a college that looks like it was started by the son of mr worldwide it's actually quite simple hustle versity was started by andrew tate a guy that basically no one knew about until six months ago and is now somehow more searched than mr beast kanye west or most shocking of all even the island boys who i know i thought would have a career forever but such are the tides of fame i suppose and i guess the real question is how did this happen and why well andrew attributes his meteoric success to a change in business strategy i put together a particular strategy about six months ago because i decided to step up my overall exposure because of a new product i launched i run an online school that teaches people how to make money online i changed my approach towards social media and i ended up absolutely everywhere now if you're wondering what business strategy that is or even what business this guy's in turns out he's one of these male success gurus who will be your surrogate father essentially for a fee and the program he runs is called hustle versity where he teaches you how to make fast money if you'll only pay fifty dollars a month and one of these fast money methods turns out to be selling hustle adversity to new people by posting clips of him andrew tate and because of this it kind of created this pyramid scheme where there was a flood of tick-tock videos and bias reviews saying that andrew tate is the one true savior that will save you from poverty he's basically morpheus from the matrix and that's not even me calling him that he calls himself that i get called morpheus along we are living inside of the matrix and i am morpheus he says he wants to wake you from your mental prisons all by selling you a program that sounds like what high school dropouts used to put as their education status on facebook attended the school of hard knocks and graduated hustleversity with a phd wait you're a doctor no that's the pimping ho's degree which is something by the way i didn't make up it's a course that andrew tate himself sells but i don't think you want to take advice from someone who's in the middle of a human investigation and that's not even to mention accusations of beating women or him allegedly admitting that one of his businesses was quote a total scam but none of this has stopped over a hundred thousand people from signing up for hustle versity which at 50 bucks a month nets him five million dollars a month despite it being a repackaged version of the same male guru griff that we've seen over a hundred times like tom vu john crostani dan lok grant cardone need i go on what's the difference with tate see despite his alleged criminality toxicity psychopathy andrew does have one undeniable skill that seems to be responsible for most or all of his success so far he's just really entertaining i hate everyone equally don't come at me and call me sexist or racist or any of these things i hate everyone i don't care if you're black white straight gay man and woman i hate you anyway do know how to administer cpr however i will not administer cpr unless you're a hot female if you're some fat dude and you just had a heart attack and i don't really know you is that a lady building you a new back and rearrange your bones why is it been missing for around four hours straight bro i have a lot of muscle it's it's painful to carry around it's a two-hour massage you see guys modern influencers are slowly learning that we live in a post-consequence world with people like jake paul running around just serially scamming people and nothing happening to them people are starting to realize that the only real currency is attention like the worst thing that's going to happen to you is not that you go to jail the worst thing that's going to happen to you is you become irrelevant and this is what separates andrew tate from a lot of the fake gurus i've covered in the past and makes him much more effective and maybe dangerous at what he does and in that way he's got more in common with someone like alex jones we're gonna beat your ass you just get that through your stinking traitorous heads then he does with someone like dan lok or grant cardone both jones and tate operate sort of on this playbook where entertainment is king they say a bunch of outlandish statements that builds attention and then once they're the crazy guy all they have to do is say a few basic things that everyone agrees with and then their audience suddenly thinks they're a genius i mean everyone has seen this with alex jones right you have modern philosopher joe rogan seemingly saying that he predicts everything alex is right about far more than he's wrong when in reality alex jones is predicting everything sort of all the time so of course he's going to be right some of the time and it's sort of the same with tate he says so much like in one segment he'll say something outlandish like men should be able to cheat on women but it doesn't work the other way around because that's disgusting let's not pretend that male loyalty and female loyalty are the same thing but loyalty is loyalty but they're not the same thing are they however i would not see my infidelity as nearly anywhere near even one percent as disgusting as female infidelity and he knows that's going to get him clicks and piss people off but then we'll say in a segment right after i believe in true love between a man and a woman i believe there should be more love i think relationships are a beautiful thing i think that the synergy between men and women are a beautiful thing if they are correctly collaborated i think that that's what makes society function i think that's what makes the world function i think that many men and women falling in love and having children and having families are very very beautiful things well who doesn't agree with that and i'll talk to like men's issues he'll talk about how lonely men are most men are absolutely not really invisible this is the truth about masculinity right it's very easy for women to sit here and complain about the top two percent of men because i met with dealt with this guy's arrogant blah blah blah blah most men don't even [ __ ] exist they send 10 000 dm's and never even get read let alone replied to and so this makes it so that the many people who are trying to say ah andrew's just crazy they don't see the full con that he's running because the crazy is only half of the game because eventually people hear the other half the basic stuff that's obvious and go well he's not totally crazy and people just eventually kind of go down the tate rabbit hole where they think you know maybe i can leave the matrix and get girls jets and bugattis maybe i just need to become financially free how do i do it who's looking out for me and that's where hustle versity enters the picture and look i know we just covered a lot right but to understand this next part to understand hustle versity it requires a deep understanding of andrew tate's appeal so we can see why hustle adversity is on the one hand so popular despite being so bad because otherwise this whole video is anticlimactic and confusing because when i first joined hustleversity i thought it's got to be different right to have this many people paying every month they have to have things that you just can't learn for free right right once again i'm disappointed because i joined this month and have been going through the classes which is basically all of the same boring topics all of these guys teach about making money it's all the most surface level stuff he assigns a so-called professor to each skill and all of this all takes place inside of discord servers and so in these chat rooms where your instructors have a fraction of the charisma of tate you're supposed to commit yourself to these skill sets which are super surface level because of course this all appeals to the lowest common denominator men who think answers can come from tick tock videos and this is where it starts to hit you as you're scrolling through discord threads that this kind of was all a big bait and switch i mean think about it you've been told you're gonna escape the matrix you're gonna take the red pill but what you end up doing in this course is sort of learning how to run an amazon side hustle for jeff bezos like no offense you're not breaking the matrix you work for the richest guy in the world like imagine morpheus gives neo the red pill and says hey have you ever day traded before it doesn't stop there either like you've been told you're going to be rich right i guarantee you will make money with this system hold on tight we're about to get rich but hustlers university sort of changes the rules and definitions once you're inside like they have this cash quadrant of time and cash where you're either time poor or cash poor time rich cash for cash rich time you get the idea and what they define cash rich as is very telling they define it as having five thousand dollars which by that definition guys i'm proud to say i'm cash rich now guys look having five thousand dollars is great but you ain't rich right the lifestyle we've been sold on here is exotic bugattis not extra starbucks biscottis i mean am i crazy here like i feel like most people who join this discord want olive lamborghinis and they're sort of getting olive garden fettuccine and this weird disconnect is everywhere where andrew tate is practically screaming how great hustlers university is on the one hand hofstra's university is the greatest thing that exists on the face of the planet for people who are trying to escape the matrix and yet if you look at their own success screenshots that they provide their students are getting at best like very part-time income like their screenshots of 400 a month maybe 2 000 a month and those are the examples they chose which i'm not knocking the people who are doing this like good for them but unless you consider being cash rich having five thousand dollars total in your bank account then this course doesn't seem to be getting people rich it just teaches lost guys extremely basic skills that are free to learn but charges them 50 a month for it so they can feel like they're escaping the matrix by working for jeff bezos and this all brings us kind of back to the real reason for the success of hustlers university which is of course tate himself but the irony is that once you join the university you barely see tate at all he claims to be teaching the secrets to modern wealth creation but the reality is from what i saw he was too busy marketing to actually be present in the discord and instead you just had all these random people teaching you like e-commerce or freelancing or copywriting and investing and this is kind of one of the reasons that i struggled to get good screenshots to show you guys from inside the course because it was so boring and bland and that's why i decided to finally cancel my plans to become cash rich and that's when i found out about the last trick tate uses to get you to stay anyone who messes this up annoys a professor doesn't renew their subscription their card cancels anything stupid then you're gonna regret it for a very long time because there's simply nowhere else to go that's right they tell you there's nowhere else to go besides hustlers university this is the only place where you're gonna learn not to be broke and even the people who want to be part of it and simply don't have the money tate has told them that there's no second chances they're gonna go back in the matrix if they miss a single payment i had to unsubscribe to get my mother a birthday present but i resubscribed the next month i don't believe that i don't believe you and i also think if you were a member of of hustlers university for a month and you didn't make enough money to buy your mother a birthday present you [ __ ] up so you're probably gonna end up kicked out like their two responses are that's not true and even if it is it's your fault anyways which i find amazing it couldn't be the program right guys and you have to understand that for the people actually in the course they're like deathly afraid of missing a payment because they've been told that if they do guess where they're going that's right straight back in the matrix in jail they call it and you'll see we have people in jail so people who uh don't renew we don't kick you out we put you in the jail and you sit there in your cell and you have no access to the money-making information and we just flood you with all the endless wins every time someone wins we show you i mean andrew tate hasn't reinvented anything he's just doing it more successfully than a lot of fake gurus have in a while but the result is the same as ever where the real person getting rich truly rich is andrew tate you're broke you're [ __ ] poor
