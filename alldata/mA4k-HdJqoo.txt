when you first start learning python one of the first things you learn how to do is create a string and shortly after that you will probably learn about slicing so I mean at this point you already know that you can slice a string by using square brackets and specifying the positions of that string to slice with a colon so you can say from the position of 5 to 10 and when you actually run this you're going to get this slice right here but now suppose we have some more text and this will be called for example I am not a teapot so suppose you have some more text right and you're using the same Slice on that other text this will work perfectly we can still slice the text perfectly but this comes at a cost and the cost is that if we're using the exact same slice for these two variables every time we change it we're going to have to change it in both places and that might not be a problem if you're using it only on two variables in the exact same location but if you're using it throughout your project it's going to get quite annoying to update everything and you're probably also going to forget about it so one thing they don't really teach you when you're learning python because it's more relevant to data science is how to use the inbuilt slice object and the first thing you might try to do is create a slice using this syntax you might say okay we're going to create a slice from 3 to 10 like this but this will not work in Python there is different syntax that we have to use to achieve this kind of functionality and what I'm talking about is the slice object here we can finally create a slice that's going to simulate this part of the code right here so for example we can say from 3 to 10. and now we can just insert my slice there we can say okay my slice there and my slice that so we can update it throughout our code every time we need to update our slice we will just update it in this one location so if we run it we will get the exact same result now there are some things that don't work when you're using a slice such as usually you would use a colon to say that you want to get all the elements up to that index well this does not work when you use a slice object you're going to have to replace all those instances where you use a colon with the none keyword and that will act as the colon so now if we run this we're going to get all the elements up to the position of 10 and this also works with things like reversing a string where you would usually use colon colon -1 but with a slice you would have to type in none none minus one and that would achieve the exact same functionality as using colon colon -1 as you can see now we have this reversed anyway I'm not going to say that I encounter this kind of functionality often I've actually never had to repeat a slice in my entire life using Python and at this point that's becoming four years so saying my entire life probably doesn't mean much but I would love to hear in the comment section down below if this looks like it would be something useful to you or whether you already knew about it or not I know that I already created a quiz and a short about this so you might have learned it from from there but I would still love to hear what you think about this in the comment section down below and with all that being said as always thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video
