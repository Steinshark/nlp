Mr I don't lose that nothing is back correction Mister just got unbanned from scamming us back this time he's selling nfts now I'm gonna tell you guys this is an obvious scam if you can just read the signs but since Floyd can't read I'm going to explain it to you all by telling you the history of Floyd Money Mayweather and crypto our story starts in 2018 when Floyd Mayweather was banned for three years from promoting Securities after scamming his fans with an Ico called Centra Tech he was promoting tons of these Ico scams at the time and he also narrowly avoided an Ico fraud lawsuit for the same thing under the defense that he wasn't actually influential enough to convince people to buy the scam and now that it's 2022 his three-year Securities ban is over and he's back to scamming again he's currently being sued once again for his promotion of ethereum Max alongside Kim Kardashian and also has gotten really into nfts and if you in the nft world and you betting on me you will never lose but what I need you to do right know go get May reverse that's my new nft I've been working on that for months if I win you win now it's pretty obvious from these comments that Floyd has learned nothing after not reading the SEC settlement so maybe that's why he tells us we can't lose by betting on him so let's put that to the test with his last three nft projects I'm dropping my nft tonight for nft.com August 10th go get it right now matter of fact don't even wait till August 10th get it now my nft own a piece of my legacy Floyd Money Mayweather I'm not just in 30 or 40 full 100 about yeah I'm all the way in now Floyd's world was indeed a huge success for Floyd Mayweather who raked in 4.9 million dollars but what happened to his fans well they're Furious because the price of this nft has collapsed over 90 percent and they angrily responded in the comments section you already have an nft project it's called at real Floyd nft You released it last year and then stopped working on it immediately after have you been punched in the head so much you're forgetting these things now yes ladies and gentlemen I know it looks bad Logan Paul may have rocked Floyd more than we care to believe but there's more to this story bored bunny is another nft scam that Floyd promoted anyone want to guess how that went January 4th board bunny will launch everybody stay tuned now if you were dumb enough to stay tuned to this one it dropped Like a Rock 90 losses and then of course you have the board Bad Bunny project which Floyd also promoted which is like board bunny but bad batter worse the nft world is on fire board bunny we killed the first one right now we about to drop another board bunny but it's bored Bad Bunny first one was crazy now this one you gotta check it out all right fine Floyd I'll check it out and uh it went to zero but if you thought those were all the skeletons in Floyd's closet you're wrong meta skeletons I personally want to say thank you to the artist and a team over at metaskeletons that's right he wants to thank them for paying him to say this and you guys um your investment is uh if we check the numbers on this oh God right and if the instead of these worthless now so to summarize Floyd Money Mayweather in a way his fans can understand Floyd is 0-9 with an astonishing two lawsuits and one TKO from the SEC and he wants you to bet on him he wants to go one more round in the ring he wants to get paid again and it doesn't sound like a good idea to me when it comes to legalized bank robbing I'm the best [Applause]
