no I have the best billion dollar app idea 
[Music] I need to go to my computer now complete okay as you can see that tip or that 
person is not very realistic when it comes to   how apps are built and also to how they are 
executed a lot of times when we think we are   going to have this amazing idea the first thing 
that comes to mind is how much people we are going   to help how much money we are going to make 
if we're being honest with ourselves and it's   just going to be this great thing the reality is 
though following those emotions come the emotions   of almost getting Frozen meaning you don't know 
where to start it is so overwhelming how are you   ever going to build this app how is it going to 
be successful scalable you start thinking about   all the resources you need today we are going 
to cover what exactly it takes to build an app   from idea to final product to deploying it and 
different tools that can help you along the way   foreign to start with though let's look at the 
timeline of what it consists of to really build   an app from idea from beginning to end and 
then go through each step to start with of   course is the idea you have this great idea 
and it's kind of high level the next thing   you need to do is break it down step by step 
really think about your feature list what are   some of the features for your MVP you want to 
start with then comes market research who is   your target audience why is this going to be 
useful for you this is easier said than done   and is something that you will need to spend 
a lot of time on once you have achieved both   of those steps which as I mentioned sound easier 
than they actually are but at the end of the day   they are crucial steps to getting started it's 
time for the fun stuff or in some cases the most   challenging stuff which is choosing the right 
technology I need some coffee for this next part because choosing the right technology that is 
where it really gets tricky and that's what I   want to focus in on today how do you find the 
right technology to work with better yet maybe   you are a developer just starting out in your 
career or you're a developer that maybe you're   even senior but you don't want to spend all your 
free hours building this application how can you   achieve that I started doing some research and 
wondering what would I do if I was to build an   app all over again and one of the platforms that 
I kept on coming back to the sap learning site has   many learning Journeys you can take courses you 
can take with different quizzes but one that I   really want to focus in on today is the compose 
and automate with sap build the no code way and   I know you might be thinking Tiff no code what 
are you talking about but honestly if you look   at the stats which I'll put up on screen here no 
code is continuing to grow so quickly in demand   and it's because it's able to scale and grow so 
quickly you can come in with little to no coding   experience and build these really super powerful 
applications okay so I have up on screen here sap   build and I specifically want to go to unit 2 
which is creating a first application with sap   build apps so let's open that up here and you can 
see down below that this is a business scenario   they give you you're going to build an app that 
lets you scan the barcode on a food product then   it calls an API AI to get the calorie content and 
displays the product name and calorie count so you   can see if we scroll down exercise options and 
then also to what the prereqs are and honestly I   just want to pause here it's kind of wild to think 
how quickly you can build these applications with   going through courses like this that really 
bring your idea to application and we right   now are speaking about creating your first app 
so it's pretty simple in the ideation stage or   the building stage but also too they have courses 
for process Automation and deployment as well so   you literally take your idea your app from idea 
to deploying it which is wild there is no excuse   anymore if you have a million billion dollar idea 
or something that's going to help millions of   people even one person now is the time so as you 
can see here though after you are done creating   your app there's always a quiz at the end which I 
am a huge quiz person I love it because it really   reinforces what you are learning so this is a 
great way when you're going through this course to   understand if you need to go back and redo maybe 
the lesson or if you're ready to carry on also too   I'll share with you a little tip that I like to 
do when building really anything is I always take   the tutorial read the documentation whatever the 
case is because what that does is yes of course it   teaches you how to use the tool and build faster 
but also too what it typically does is a lot of   the logic that you are learning when it comes to 
building this application even if it comes to a   low code application you can then transfer into 
your own app so for example in the use case of the   barcode maybe this Sparks something in you that 
you want to implement our Barcode Scanner in your   application as well just a little tip it's kind of 
cheating this is a cheating assistant no I think   it's just being a quick learner anyways I just 
mentioned as well about Automation and what really   is automation what does that even mean and why is 
it important in the idea to final product for the   app when you are building you want to ensure you 
can automate as many processes as possible because   at the end of the day if you can save time where 
you are building and thinking and have processes   automated for you it's going to save you a lot of 
money as well so let's go here as you can see some   examples automate manual repetitive tasks such as 
copying pasting data into a spreadsheet another   one being digitalized manual and semi-automated 
processes such as capital expenditure and then   you can see on screen here we're actually going to 
go through an example of automating a process with   sap build automation so they give you the scenario 
you will complete the first steps to create the   process and trigger a form for the process using 
drag and drop functionality so you can do it in   a live environment or platform simulation alright 
so we have kind of checked off a lot on our list   we have started from idea went to doing some 
user research some target market research then   we started actually working on building the app 
we're using sap learning to really go through   the process before we go through building our own 
app but actually understanding what steps to take   by following the course and documentation this 
is just my personal thought take that as I was   actually just editing this video I decided to pop 
back on camera here and share with you because I   feel like I wouldn't be doing this video Justice 
if I didn't at least acknowledge or speak about   money and why I think it's so important to do that 
is because when you are building an app oftentimes   something the thought that comes to mind is well 
how am I going to make money from this application   even if the pure intention is to help individuals 
if you are going to be continuing building this   app and where is the money coming from who is 
funding it and I want to share my thoughts around   how to make money with your application where does 
the money come from and this might be contrary to   popular belief popular to what experts are telling 
you but here's my biggest advice that I have found   through being a content creator and through 
working on a startup behind the scenes which is   more to come soon on that and many other things 
the reality is don't worry about it wait one   tip that sounds so silly you just said that's so 
important how it would even don't worry about it   the money will follow give value to 
people create a very valuable product   that people will find useful entertaining 
educational whatever that pillar is   don't focus on well I need to add this feature 
in because that is how I will generate money   don't worry about that at the end of the day if 
you are making an application a website a service   that has value once again whatever value that 
looks like doesn't mean it has to be educational   it could also be entertaining or a mixture of both 
but if you are making something that has value to   people is helping people and they are utilizing 
it the money will follow whether it be through   advertisements on the bottom of your application 
whether it be through partnering up with other   companies for collaboration Services whatever 
the case is I think some of the greatest apps   though have really started or greatest ideas have 
really started out of passion not being afraid to   take that risk and then also to just focusing 
on your end user and how you can provide value   versus building a product on how it will generate 
money now once again this is just my two cents on   it I think it's really important to note because 
too often we are even subconsciously driven by   if this succeeds it needs to make so much money 
and how will that happen focus on today focus   on getting your app on the App Store focus on 
getting your service on on the focus on getting   your service online whatever the case is the money 
will follow and just focus on one step one foot   in front of the other otherwise you are going to 
look too far ahead and in turn honestly probably   get nothing done all right by this point we have 
done a lot from ideation to actually building the   app what comes next well of course you need to 
decide where you're going to put this app are   you going to put it on iTunes are you going to 
put it on Google Play and of course that comes   into play how the app was built which we spoke 
about earlier but also too it's really important   to note how are you going to Market this app you 
might have the greatest idea ever ever to exist   but if it's not marketed in the right way that's 
another challenge for me I am not a marketing   expert by any means I always rely on Experts to do 
their job so at this point what I would do if you   are more developer focused or technical focused 
or big idea picture focused even I would say reach   out to a friend who's a marketer go on upwork go 
on one of these freelancing sites find someone   who you really trust or build that relationship 
with to help Market your product because it you   have to let the ego go no matter how amazing your 
product is if it's not marketed right there's a   very low chance that it will succeed alright as 
you know I have collaborated with sap on a few   other things in the past and I always get really 
excited about collaborating and sharing different   tools or courses with you that they produce and 
one of the main reasons is because sap courses or   sap having sap on your resume as a whole in any 
format is going to help you stand out to Future   employers to business partners to anything 
like that it is such a great way to really   stand out from the crowd and I think one of 
the biggest things that we talk about a lot   on here is how to stay ahead of Technology how 
to stay ahead of the curve and this is a great   way to do it so I really hope you enjoyed going 
through this with me going through a little bit   of the sap Learning Journey specifically the 
sap build journey and I'm linking it down below   so make sure to go check it out alright thank 
you for watching this video I hope you found it   very helpful but also too inspirational go take 
this course go start really understanding how to   build applications from ideation to deployment to 
fully getting people to use it and Beyond and all   I know I'm really curious have you built an app 
on your own before have you tried one of these   tools before such as a low code solution let me 
know down in the comments alright thank you all   make sure to hit that subscribe if you haven't 
and I'll see you soon thanks everyone [Music]   foreign [Music]
