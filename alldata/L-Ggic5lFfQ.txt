ladies and gentlemen welcome back to the 2023 chess Grand Swiss this is an epic Tournament being held at the Isle of Man and it determines who is going to make the candidates chess tournament uh which will be an early 2024 the candidates Tournament of course winner uh takes on the world chess champion later in that year Fabiano Carana hikara Nakamura Ali resua just the name a few players who are competing this round featured one of the most absurd stockfish continuations I have ever seen in my life there was ridiculous sacrifices there was Grand Masters getting checkmated in 15 moves I'm going to give you an update on all the top players we will continue to follow the developing story lines and we're just going to have a great time that's that's what we're going to do uh we have it every single time uh and uh again a special thank you to all of you here in uh the book launch week in late October of 2023 for making it so incredible for checking out the book getting the book reviewing the book if you bought the book you are very very much appreciated uh I just want to say thank you really I thank you thank you thank you um game one this game ended before it even began I wasn't even fully awake this game ended Matias blue bomb versus vahab salal Germany versus tury knight F3 D5 very quickly it becomes some sort of English where white plays the move C4 and then you will notice that blue bomb delays the development of this Pawn so it's not really a queen's Pawn game but it kind of can always become a queen's Pawn game Knight C3 Bishop E7 blah blah blah blah blah B6 okay take take Pawn to D4 all of this has been played many many many times before Bishop B7 Bishop to D3 just regular stuff just two guys who are developing their pieces black plays Pawn to A6 preventing White from Ever playing Knight to B5 now here blue bound plays Knight E2 the idea of Knight E2 is very simple he just wants to put his Knight on G3 he wants the bishop to support the E5 square and then he wants to have the C file what does he give up when he plays Knight to E2 he gives up the square on e4 but he's fine with that because I'm assuming after this and this he can play Pawn to F3 removing that Knight soal plays Bishop D6 after thinking for 9 minutes clearly intending to meet Knight to G3 with the intention of Knight F5 and capturing this bishop would would would result in a very very bad Pawn structure his idea there is to play G6 he cannot yet play the very natural Knight E4 because after Knight F5 grabbing this bishop is just good for white so instead of that G6 white plays Knight E5 and black plays Knight E4 okay both guys have kind of accomplished what they would like to do blue bound plays Bishop takes he gives up the bishop for the Knight the reason that he does that is that now black has a Pawn on e4 that is a target so you can play a move like Queen to C2 you can also utilize the freed up C4 Square to go there and then take and that Bishop could prove to be a menace in the attack so we have Queen to C2 and now something weird happens blue mom attacks this salal defends it and now blue bom plays D5 D5 cuts the Bishop from seeing the pawn D5 also opens up the vision of this bishop if black takes with the Knight he loses support of E4 so we're going to get this then black can go here and then here and then this looks very annoying but actually after Queen E7 the position's okay and there's 's even a nice little tactic Knight takes E3 to try to take this then there's Knight F6 check Queen F6 both Queens are hanging and the game actually does end up fizzling out into a draw but if you take with the bishop vop spent 10 minutes on that move and it loses on the spot because suddenly you cannot stop the battery and the very simple threat that white has here is to move the Knight to play Knight to G4 which would threaten the Knight lure it away and then get checkmated the game is over so black plays H5 and all of a sudden Knight to D7 and black resigns oh my if you take with the Knight it's made in one and if you take with the queen it's made in two and if you don't take it all then you are just down a piece for the duration of the game and you will lose this game what that just happened out of nowhere Grand Master just got checkmated in 15 moves that almost never happens that is wild out of nowhere just Queen up one square you know the thing is VAP probably spent a long time calculating Rook D1 or the other Rook to D1 and he just totally missed Queen C3 and blue bomb wins in like 10 minutes which not not actually but crazy now the next game that I have for you is oh my uh if your kids are watching this is a parental advisory warning um D4 Knight F6 this is Dennis lazovic it's a young talented Grandmaster from uh bellarus and his opponent is radoslav vask who is a number two ranked chess player from Poland this is a Catalan this is basically the only opening that that Dennis lavic knows uh I'm joking but if you look at levik's games he literally only plays the Catalan it is actually quite fascinating um against everything and he's 2560 GM and he's like seven years old so he's like 17 or something but very very good player he's also one of the most accurate players on chess.com because all of his openings are the Catalan so like I think his average accuracy in some rapid events something was like 93% because he's just so solid Bishop B4 check at least with white I don't know about with black A5 and lvic plays this line with Queen C1 I will not pretend to know anything about this because the Cataline is one of the weirdest openings in chess both guys are blitzing out all of their moves because well except here L ofic things for a little bit uh because they clearly know the theory white is going to put pressure on Black's kind of passive Queen side black is just going to try to Vibe literally Knight to E5 Here Comes white trying to be you know provocative and taking a little bit of space and now the Knight comes to C3 and we're just trying to make a bit of progress here but vasic plays B6 and vachik is like look I'm not going to get bullied by a child so I'm sacrificing a pawn I'm sacrificing a pawn so I get activity and at some point I'm going to play the move C5 at which point my Bishop my rook and this bishop are all going to come alive and that is exactly what happens and here comes vasik all that queenside counterplay coming down the board boom boom Rooks C5 now he is still a pawn down and he doesn't have the two Bishops the bishop pair is a very significant advantage in chess and yet despite all of that here he is winning one of his pawns back we have Rook B2 he goes back with his Queen it's a very very tense position and here Dennis lvic breaks away from his true and tried style of solidity and goes wild this is like when you're sheltered you're in you know your your entire life in high school you go to college all of a sudden you you get get you get access to a whole bunch of things all right right Bishop takes H6 he's trying some crazy stuff over here the idea is very straightforward after takes takes the Knight is hanging and if the Knight goes back to defend the king I'm assuming he wants to play E4 and try to blow up the center of the board you can't really go Rook D4 because your back rank is a bit weak but I think that's sort of the point instead here after Bishop takes H6 G takes H6 he reconsiders and he plays Queen to D4 or maybe that was always his idea he plays here and queen to D4 which I suppose is a fork and in this position radoslav vashek instead of licking his wounds finds the absolutely monstrous Queen to a one my friends you have a Knight hanging and you have a rook hanging hanging and instead you hang your queen in reality the queen now has eyes on this and this and if Rook takes A1 Rook takes A1 nothing can save the king except the bishop what does black do now black sacrifices The Rook The Rook on C5 is completely hanging but you open the door for the bishop and my friends this is over white is mated doesn't matter that there's the queen and a rook standing around the only way that white survives this is by giving up the queen back and being a full Knight down Queen A1 oh my God that is a cold ice bucket of water on the head right there that is like yep can't nothing you can do about that Queen A1 from vasic absolutely Savage move move and now DEA spends 25 minutes probably wondering why did I take on H6 I mean I had a completely normal position Bishop takes H6 and uh unfortunately vask is just up a knight or fortunately if you're supporting him and Dennis still gets really aggressive but the Knight goes back to G8 he still gets very aggressive but there's nothing to be done vashek guards his King and uh in this position white just resigned lavic just said I'm down a night like I'm not going to play this on I I could but I'm I am lost queen to A1 and somewhere stockfish smiled what a move my friends it's time to go around the horn Fabiano Carana on board one recently newly remitted 2800 just him and Magnus up there he's 2-0 in this tournament he just beat Hans demon will he continue to destroy people regardless of what color he is playing in this round he is playing vvin Lami and if if you have an apostrophe in your name you are kind of a Chad so a lot of respect not as cool as having a click in your name like if his name was look like if his name was spectacular I mean even cooler but I'll take an apostrophe Irvin is also the I think uh trainer training partner coach uh of Anish giri famed and esteemed uh father husband and Grandmaster Bishop to for this is an a by the way Fabiano Carana playing an A6 Queen's Gambit decline probably has the Gotham Queen's Gambit declined repertoire with A6 take take Bishop F4 Bishop E5 this has been played before don't worry about the theory don't pretend like I'm not going to pretend like we're going to learn it anyway now Fabby gets a little bit provocative in the opening with this Knight trying to maybe bring the F Pawn into the action which you'll see in a little bit that's exactly what happens and now we have Bishop C4 and basically we're going to get to a situation where Ain just trades the p a lot of the pieces and on by the time move 17 comes around it's just Rooks and knights white is going to try to go here black will either plant the Knight on D5 or in White's territory in White's territory we go and now a nice little move Knight to C1 and the point of Knight to C1 is that if you take on B2 Rook B1 Rook B1 Right light takes be to Rook B1 and then I'm going to get the pawn on B7 so that is the point so instead of that Fabby goes back now we have Knight E2 Knight D3 that's actually Fabby offering a draw and this is Fabby saying you know what maybe I want to play for a little bit longer and now we have Knight C3 so the players do a little dance and then we go to a rook end game and I think you kind of get where this is going absolutely nothing happens and the game ends in a draw and move 31 sometimes that's chess all right this is why it's kind of hard to Market it all right because if you're just going to sell this to an Advertiser but sometimes that's how it goes this is not Fab's fault it's playing Black it's hard to win with black play tries to play kind of an imbalanced Queen's game with declined his opponent just plays in literally the most solid way possible and then they trade a bunch of pieces and then they dance around with knights and then and then that the game is a rook in game and then it's a draw so Fabi has 2 and a half he probably lost like three rating points for drawing this game maybe two which is brutal I think he might be like 27.99 now but he has two and a half out of three decent start for him he can't ask for much more uh and here's Hikaru hikaru's had a I think if you asked hikaro if he could have two draws to start the event he would probably be unhappy like I think he would probably prefer one and a half out of two but such his life and now he has the white pieces again uh this time against Arian Chopra who is one of the 80 3 Indian Grand Masters not playing at the tournament but just in life we have Knight C3 and we have this E3 approach so black plays a semi slav one of the most combative openings and hikaro plays E3 which is a little bit more solid but you know Bishop D6 a good line castles castles and he just develops his pieces like Karo just puts his Bishops out and then plays Bishop D3 this is a line where white spends two moves doing this I can't really explain it it it's it's it's basically played like this because if you play Bishop D3 right away then black can play DC that's why hitting your Bishop whereas if you play Bishop B2 and then DC White has an extra option to play A4 preventing B5 if Knight B6 I play A5 that's kind of the point so Hikaru kind of avoids D takes and then he plays Bishop D3 later and you have no Advantage whatsoever but it's life Queen E7 Rook C1 both guys bring their Rooks and now black needs to play Rook d8 I mean as far as my theoretical knowledge here goes uh Rook d8 is the move like black needs to put their Rooks here uh and and that's all I remember and then there's a big explosion in the center but black plays Bishop B4 after 10 minutes and that's inaccurate uh it's not a blunder but but I just remember i' I've studied this position before I think I think black has to do this instead of playing Bishop to B4 but hikaro plays Knight D2 after 7 minutes and now black needs to do something in the center otherwise black has just extremely passive like if black makes one more waiting move white is going to play E4 and then after something like d takes E4 Knight takes E4 you could even take with the bishop Knight takes E4 Bishop takes E4 White's just got you know good cannons here not like that like that so in the game black plays E5 hikaro plays Bishop F5 with good pressure taking advantage of the newly weakened F5 Square take take and now hikaro finds a very nice idea C5 and now black is in trouble white has all whole rectangle of a board to operate with and Black's pieces are going to get suffocated to death over here C5 is a nice idea it prevents the Bishop from coming home if Pawn takes C5 and if this I'm going to take so if you take my knight I'm going to go here and for a moment you're going to go well I'm up material yeah a7's hanging and also this and that pin so if you play A6 I go here you got to go here because if you go here you get mated that that would be very embarrassing at this level all right so instead of that we have G6 Hikaru continues to to to supply the pressure look at hikaru's Pawn structure Five Pawns on the dark squares that Bishop is still still sealed out he's about to put all of his pawns on the dark squares B takes now Karu switches the plan and plays D takes to to open the the bishop remember that Bishop from the blue bomb game the dark squir Bishop F and kto in the corner vicious stuff now now Bishop takes C5 hikaro activates the bishop and The Rook so hikaro right now is a pawn down but the laser beams of the Bishops really burn Black's position and he's down 30 minutes on the clock the bishop goes back Hikaru gets rid of his Bishop why because he uses a tactic to infiltrate into his opponent's territory Knight to E4 utilizing a PIN to enter and cause damage black plays F6 that move stops a lot of the dark squ stuff but weakens the light squares now that Knight Zips to C5 now it's replaced by the other Knight the queen goes to F7 this bishop is is dead that Bishop is an idiot complete idiot deny science you know like I'm talking about the whole thing Queen to D4 with the battery Knight to G7 look at chopra's pieces I mean they are doing their job but they are not having having a good time the queen goes to A4 the bishop oh my goodness oh my goodness The Bishop's got absolutely no oxygen bedroom with with no windows hikaro brings reinforcements takes takes black finally decides I got to get rid of the Rooks Hikaru says no problem I'm going to zip around this way look at that look at that blacks just got no moves complete and total dominance from Karo on the dark squares anchoring in the Knight on B4 the queen could come give a check it doesn't matter the bishop the bishop doesn't have x-ray VIs Bishop can't even move the bishop now comes back to B7 and tries to zip around and does zip around and Hikaru actually according to stockfish could have been a little bit more accurate here he needed to go Queen B8 there was a ridiculous Engine line here Bishop A6 sacrificing the bishop check here Queen E4 and then the King has to go for a run and then the King goes to E2 if the King goes to E2 there's this so you go here and then you go back that's tough to see and that's how you avoid the draw instead hikaro playing mostly on his opponent's deep time trouble allows the bishop into the game his opponent tries to fight him back tactically and plays Bishop E4 but we end up in an end game where only white can win because black has way too many Pawn weaknesses F3 Hikaru picks up a pawn and ultimately gets that one and after he gets that one he gets straight to the black king this king is wide open the a pawn is the worst possible Pawn to defend against it's an outside pass pawn and hikaro wins a a combative game for sure but he wins it all the same Queen to G6 H6 a very nice game very nice game I mean maybe he won't be happy I I don't know with what I'm not I don't really understand what it's like to be uh you know that level of of of chess player but um I think looking at this game it was very smooth sailing so uh I would would be happy if I was him that was a that seemed like a very nice game very fun game game that allowed him to be creative and put a lot of pressure on his opponent from all sides of the board and hearo back with a win with two points out of three uh the top board on the women's side was tanong versus antoaneta stefanova and we will finish the video by talking about one of the most absurd stories I've ever seen which is 20s something year old ramazan janov rated 2,447 who is having the greatest tournament potentially of this entire year first the board won of the women's side this was a Queen's Gambit declin similar A6 to the Fabby game but actually the setup was similar to the hikaro game in the sense that white played Bishop E2 and B3 uh black played in a way where they were solid and there was this very nice Square on B4 for black to uh put a piece tanr y demonstrated exceptional positional skills in this game she put her Knight on E5 then she proceeded to trade Knights and simply say look I have three pawns and you have like two and kind of a little help here so I'm going to spend my game just moving down that side of the board she brought her Queen her opponent went A5 to try to stop that pawn in its tracks and then play Bishop B4 so she moved her rook and put the Knight exactly in front of the light squared Bishop and then she played Bishop F1 protecting her G2 pawn and at some point she's just going to go C5 and either black is going to be able to survive or not so she went here stopping Knight G4 and then she went C5 and now black has to deal with the ramifications of the position she tries But Here Comes Knight D6 black is going to have to sacrifice the rook and I'm not yelling that because it's mostly a defensive move to try to basically just get rid of that but instead of that black allows the Knight to survive and while this Knight is here while you are constantly distracted with this Knight screaming at everything here comes the bishop and there's a secret hidden idea of Bishop to G5 it's the opening of the door for the Queen the queen is going to get snuck into the territory with Queen to G3 and queen to H4 and then you have potential Rook lift possibilities as well black plays this but now it's too little too late now it's too little too late now white gets everything white is going to to get the material and the attack on F6 black plays this queen H4 uh-oh uhoh and you utilize the pin the pawn is pinned to the bishop this a very nice tactical Nuance here black cannot defend black has to do this to stop maid and loses the bishop and now is just simply a rook down Queen F6 check Rook takes F7 that's mate the only way to stop it is to go here and the easiest way to win this by far not the the best way trade everything win the bishop take these pawns promote to Four Knights make a stalemate so tanr is three out of three on board one very nice and my friends allow me to show you the most absurd story of this tournament thus far ramanan is an international master from Kazakhstan past the age of 20 he might be 20 exactly but I think he's like 21 I could have looked this up I forgot so bear with me um he has defeated a 2650 Alan picho from Argentina he then defeated basam Amin from Egypt now he's playing Ali Resa fuja rated 2,777 Ali resa's rating looks like an airplane it looks like you're going to fly the Boeing Giga jet 2777 okay Ali RZA is the fastest ever player in the history of humans to reach 2800 the run of the kazak warrior will end it is over and Ali Reza plays the most cancerous opening known to man the Catalan it's over he's going to play a positional Masterpiece A6 played by ramazan A4 this is a main line Bishop C6 aliv Resa drops his Queen back to C1 this has been played many many times before and ramazan plays Knight E4 which is not the most accurate move but it is a move and Ali Resa responds with knight5 we're now going to have a clash of all the minor pieces in the center of the board ramazan takes and gives away his dark squired Bishop before trading into an endgame and trying to play Queen try trading some pieces and trying to play Queen C5 which would trade into an endgame Rook C1 takes takes this is exactly what I would expect Ali res is showing there are levels to this I am 330 rating points above you I am the number three ranked chess player on the entire planet of Earth I have a very annoying endgame that I'm about to Stew you on Rook to C8 Rook to C1 C5 this is very very bad um A5 and Ali resa is squeezing the black position like a teddy bear nothing you can do absolutely nothing I mean black might want to get this Knight here so it can have a panoramic view of the entire board right hit F4 E3 everything can't do it Knight F6 not possible Knight B6 not possible Rook B3 pressure forever B4 with the pin Bishop E3 you're going to bring the king here I mean it's over Rook C7 Bishop E3 you can't even take this because if you take that I'll just go back back and then I'm going to smash and Rook C5 and I'm going to win that end game Bishop E3 Ali Resa looking to end the run of the gentleman from Kazakhstan he has maximized all the pressure of his position C4 Bishop C5 sealing the connection from the Rooks to the pawn Rook takes C4 if you took it by black I would have played Rook C4 but now apparently the best move instead of taking is to just bring the king slowly because when you take black now has B5 and you cannot take on P I mean you can but now the Knight is coming to that panoramic view and if not to that panoramic view it's going to go back to D7 and and and now ramazan is asking his opponent excuse me what are you going to do to me there's nothing you can do I'm going to go back to B6 and back to D7 and oliv res goes Rook A1 he goes for the a pawn take take take take so oliv res is a pawn up but he's got doubled e pawns my friends that is the conclusion that is it if you simplify this down it is rook and pawn versus Rook that is what it is and you can't win this this is not winnable it looks fantastic but it is not winnable black defends his position F5 take take Rook E2 and in this position Ali Resa takes on E6 and the game ends in a draw because of Rook takes E5 check Rook takes E5 check let's say white plays King H6 take here here this is just a draw there's nothing it's a rook and pawn versus rook and Pawn and that's the that's it ramazan janov ladies and gentlemen is now 2 and a half out of three with a win over 2650 and 2680 and a draw over a 2777 rated player I mean that is that that that is that that that is unbelievable I don't even know what to say um wow uh I think that's all for today I will see you all back for round number four and um get out of here
