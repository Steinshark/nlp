ladies and gentlemen a couple of weeks ago I left the house for the first time in my life and I decided that instead of walking down to the corner store and going to the supermarket I would fly seven hours to Paris France in Paris I saw a lot of beautiful buildings I went to museums I went to the tourist attractions but I also saw some chess players and in this video I'm going to share with you live game footage from the Luxembourg Gardens in Paris France against none other than YouTuber Anna kremling in fact she is the one who recorded some of this footage so thank you to her I managed to beat her with the egg but this was one of the stupidest chess games you will ever see please sit back relax and enjoy so what do I need to do for them board is backwards but it's okay okay H4 okay I love it you're telling me full on seriously that my opening is terrible and that this is much better no okay you just don't understand okay I'm excited to understand but the board is backwards so technically I play dbv oh that's why it's called back that's pretty smart yeah yeah shout out to the egg all right I'm losing now so I guess we have to fight back what if I do this why it's fine I didn't stop the cow opening I told you how the reviews went you're just you're just telling me to play whatever I want I can take by the way you can what would Magnus play in this position I always ask myself that oh really are you getting Magnus in your brain now I don't think you I don't I don't think he would get himself into this position this is not this is not oh I know what he would play there we go okay this is great now my position is great you'd probably I was right I have no props this is egg fresh it's the egg good with three G's now yeah yeah no I'm not I'm not doing any egg over here okay well what if I just so I what is that what you want I want to stop you okay fair I want to take your Pawn the sink what would Magnus play again you want to like stop something it's weird I feel bad people are gonna actually analyze this game and give the egg any time of day do you think people will like the egg I think people will love it no definitely not hey what are you gonna do are you gonna no no I don't know what I'm gonna do okay that's the secret you just play you just play do you like Paris yeah so your first time here technically no but it's my first time as a somewhat functioning adult okay I was here when I was like 13. and I thought my parents abandoned me oh no yeah it was not fun I was gonna like call the Embassy I lost Lobby in Paris no I went back to the hotel room and they were staying at the restaurant and then they walked around for three hours oh that's pretty sad yeah that was not good that was not cool mom so you won at five I knew you were gonna do this at some point but love you it's in your King's so weird [Music] how can you like um there has to be some things just the eggs would you recommend any of your followers if anyone's watching this right now and they get inspired and say I want to be like Lobby should they do it don't be like me but I mean I'm also play play it but only in unrated games definitely don't play it otherwise I was thinking right now but maybe I should play Knight H6 first you can take I don't know I'm I have to play moves that don't require any calculation okay because I'm not very skilled so I have to like it's not nothing yeah yeah I don't think you can take that but you can you can if you want you always tell me what the last game I was you weren't right about it though I don't think you should take it maybe do whatever you want so maybe I agree with you so what if what if we just lame what a lame move you said that you like them games I'm just putting you in your territory this is not an end game this is just sadness why is it sad it's just like so boring oh it's so good my night would be so good your mom would be proud of this move she would it's a true via gravity move isn't it yes yes I played her many times I can safely say it's definitely a paper but she would be impressed with my move too this one yeah maybe not it's probably watching this going oh my God he's so bad at chess and you know what she's not wrong should I take with the King again I feel like I have one night oh that's fantastic okay let's go here I can hear my own voice why do people watch that actually wait oh that's a good move too do you see that square Levy I'm still gonna trade it off I'm not worried you're not okay except to stay calm so stay calm and collected most important I just have to stay calm like it looks really terrible because it is but like I just I stay calm nothing bad will happen nothing bad is gonna happen do cows stay calm or are they just stupid cows are just stupid to be honest it's dumb right they're actually quite smart but from keeping them in like this you know this castle without being able to remove it yeah they do become The Secret Life of gold let me what is this movie you call my move boring this is boring secret life of cows Maria how do you know so much about cow I've read the book I read a book about cows yeah generally reading a book is a good like activity for most things I I don't start I don't do it which is probably why appreciated how you threw at your mom's joke did I do that okay what are you doing uh yeah well when you throw your mom jokes down I mean it's not really yeah yeah it's very respectful like I have a new pleasure yeah um all right I guess it's gonna be some scramble or something I don't know it's going to be some story mode what can we take sorry once again I know come on fly let's be friends okay so this might be slightly problematic oh hey are you just gonna keep on talking me this is so annoying foreign [Music] you cannot survive this Levy uh let's not check right the board looks so different in France wait what am I doing yeah she's not gonna see it wait what I just forgot I had a rook no I'm much better when I sacrifice I don't know I don't know the board looks different in France I don't know it's like you had it before as well I had it for like five moves like you went down here who was it that's that said that that guy he's better than both of us all right nobody just delete all that footage and so my friends I sat down to play against Anna kramling and I figured I've recently made a video about the egg Gambit the egg defense the egg opening the egg way of life if you're going to beat somebody at chess with an egg you can either throw it at their face or you can play The Egg and that's what I did in this game and I'm going to review the game now uh it was one of the stupidest games ever played uh there was multiple checkmates missed it was awful um also I'm 9000 rated because I can because I'm making an analysis of my own game so deal with it Anna plays D4 because she doesn't play any other first moves and I played E6 now D4 is very tough to play the egg against because the bishop is already opening up which can be a problem um so I did this she went here and now you know if she had played Knight F3 I wouldn't have been able to play the egg so I would have played H6 and G5 but she played Knight C3 and and that that's that's a really good move and now you know most normal people here will play one of these two moves not me I play Pawn to G5 Ponto G5 is a is a horrendous move by all stretches of the imagination it is not a good move uh you are sacrificing a second move with a flying Pawn while your opponent takes the center you are drastically weakening your king because now you are never going to Castle this way and you've made no progress going this way um she takes the entirety of the center with the move E4 that's not a bad move uh now you may ask yourself why am I calling the egg terrible well it it it's a purely psychological opening okay I'll give you an example okay um let's say you're walking down the street and and somebody tries to mug you okay uh people have this misconception about New York that it's you know it's it's all like that everywhere but let's just say someone's going to rob you right now you could fight back you could run but what if you pooped your pants violently like let's say you just went right it's not a good move it's definitely not a good move you're making a mess but it could win you the psychological battle in the moment that's what the egg is essentially it's the equivalent of having diarrhea diarrhea in your pants so somebody doesn't mug you Bishop to G7 and now she plays H4 which is a great move uh most players under a certain level will not uh you know they will not play H4 uh they will play other moves uh H4 is a very good move because it immediately challenges me it's not letting me just do what I want if she plays something dumb but natural like Knight F3 then I'll just go G4 a lot of people here will play Knight F3 no she challenges me right away now I could defend defending's no good uh she's gonna be able to trade these pieces and then she's gonna play like Queen H5 soon I'm gonna get slaughtered uh it's not a good idea for me to take on H4 I mean I I've won a few games like this and uh like oh sorry not not not like that but like Knight F3 Knight C6 Rook H4 I had a bullet game once uh where where my opponent uh accidentally got themselves like hit like this and lost the piece uh but I decided to play G4 I thought this was a nice move because I closed out the rook and if the queen takes on G4 she's just losing a center Pawn so that's actually not really a good trade for white she plays h5s nothing wrong with this move it's not a you know it's nothing special but uh it makes sense because if she develops then I'm going to play H5 and then I get a very logical sturdy setup and you know as the kids say getting sturdy with it or something like that I I I don't know I might have just said something really terrible Bishop to E3 and now I play E5 the reason I'm wasting so much time pushing my pawns like for example uh E6 and then G6 and then G5 like why am I making all these one pawn moves in the center because the center uh needs to be closed okay I have drastically fallen behind in this game in terms of like development so with a locked center it's going to be very difficult to attack now here I play a move that's uh that that's really again mostly psychological this move really shouldn't be played I just mentioned that I'm closing up the center so it's harder for her to attack me because she has more development and here I go opening the center right I mean the computer here wants to trade off the dark scored Bishop because mine's bad and hers is good and it's really not afraid of things like this because after something like Queen F6 I actually don't have that stupid of a position Knight P5 Knight A6 is completely fine um she takes though she she took on F5 uh and then I took back and she played another good move which was trying to trade off my Bishop to try to win control of the light squares um I thought taking was stupid for me because why would I activate her Queen get her closer to castling uh the move Bishop takes D3 doesn't make any sense here but of course uh that's the top engine move for some reason followed by Bishop H6 anyway but I played Queen D7 keeping the tension she went here I developed my night out to the Corner she went here hitting my bishop and now I have to trade but at least I'm in time to Castle now I am still worse no question about it I was actually very concerned she would play Knight B5 uh I started thinking like maybe I'm gonna have to sacrifice this Pawn like the position is is very very bad for me mostly because I played the egg but also because I played like a bit of an imbecile like I should not have played at five and and now she really should put the foot on the gas here she needs to play Knight B5 H6 she really needs to question the integrity and the structure and the foundation of the black position instead she trades Queens um trading Queens is good if you think that your opponent is some sort of voodoo magician that's going to conjure up a spell and defeat you maybe that is what uh Anna thought after I played the egg again I inflicted the psychological pressure but there is no need to trade Queens with me uh right now white has the better four pieces you could argue I have three pieces out I would not even argue that uh this is like you know showing up to play basketball and sitting on the bench basically uh now Queen five and I decided okay I can take obviously she wants me to take so she could go here but it's not Checkers so I'm gonna play Knight H6 and I was like now I'm attacking her Queen she could take me but then I'm gonna go here so she took my queen and I thought I'm gonna take with my king I thought I'm gonna make some endgame progress and now we have an end game now we have a game that's that's that's much more headed in a uh in a direction of an endgame I mean I would still say there are still middle game elements I mean we've only traded a queen and a piece but uh now maybe white could go here uh she plays this move nothing wrong with it and now I have to figure something out like I have a worse position but you know I I would consider myself uh the favorite in the matchup and that you know that's no disrespect that it just it is what it is like if I was playing white and a grand master was playing Black here uh the grandmaster's still gonna try to play for a win I'm worse I'm not in any position so I'm keeping the game going I centralize my Rook excuse me I take the file this is not the center this is the center and now I'm looking like she could expand over here she's probably not gonna expand here because I control that I'm gonna have to find a way to organize my pieces and she's gonna try to get to the E6 Square that's a million dollar Square for her so she goes here I got no way to stop it right only one of my Knights can stop it if somehow someway uh we trade all the pieces for example like take take 96 and then for whatever reason this ends up the position this is awful for me I mean I understand I'm losing a piece but let's just say something like this uh this is very bad I mean I'm I'm very unhappy here because the night is so strong I'm gonna have to sack my Rook for it probably to uh to feel you know safe um so Bishop F6 right she she does get the Knight to the sixth square and I think okay this is as bad as it's going to get and apparently the computer was not really satisfied with the way that she handled this like after Knight F5 it it thought that she should just go here because I'm actually not threatening to take anything and after something like Rook F7 there is uh there is uh I'm overloaded my Rook cannot stay guarding two things I thought this wasn't a great uh move uh when I was playing the game but it turns out that 96 like I I made a lot of bad moves in this game I thought I was really smart I thought I was doing something there um so Knight F5 here here Bishop F6 and now I did this and my logic here was she can't make progress anymore it's gonna be really hard for her to push the pawns right and I thought this is easy we don't have a lot of time now so I'm just gonna trade material I'm gonna Advance over here and this Pawn is gonna very quickly become a liability when it when it first went to H5 it was a major asset for the white position but the thing is as an end game approaches right uh bishops get traded pieces get traded Queens get traded more Knights get traded like that Pawn's going to be a liability it's very difficult to get anybody to it right so B6 uh and now I you know I could have played Knight C5 I played C5 and I thought I'm locking everything down now I'm gonna bring my knight which sucks to trade this Knight which doesn't suck and she went here and I put my Rook on the open file you know on the semi on the more open file than where it's standing and I thought okay the worst is over she plays King E2 now let's trade the Knight let's play E4 let's activate the bishop and then here's something weird happened okay here I forgot how to play chess it probably had to do with load time it had to do with the Sun not being at exactly at the right angle it also just had to do with the fact that like sometimes the board live looks different than the board you see online and here I just I I completely panicked and the game became a total circus so first I played E4 which was a move that I thought made plenty sense uh she played Rook B1 and now again my plan originally was to trade this and now for some reason I just didn't do that like I I cannot explain it I mean the second she made an indication she's going to arrive on E6 I thought I'm gonna trade the Knight with my a knight like this right and that's exactly what I built up for and then I just didn't do it like ever I I don't know what I was waiting for I mean I cannot open the position while this Knight is so dominant it just doesn't make any sense but I did and she went here which was a little bit too passive and now once again I should play Knight C7 but I don't I mean I don't know what I'm doing this Knight is not a participant I don't know what I'm waiting for this night is way too strong maybe at this point I was worried about like losing the battle for the f file something like this but she can't even take with the Rook she would have to take with the wait but she has to take with a rook right so she would lose a pawn anyway I played Bishop E5 and now you know she starts firing pawns at me I should still play Knight C7 I don't she takes on C5 I take on C5 and now again should I have taken with the Knight yeah no question I mean for reasons I cannot explain I just started playing like Mega degenerate mode and now she moves the Knight now I'm like what the night moved so at this point I'm like okay well I should bring the Knight back but first let me trade this bishop let me play Bishop D4 and I thought okay this is it all right she's gonna take me I'm gonna get my knight to C5 and now my knight doesn't even have to trade for the night I'm just completely winning I got these two I got this i got this i got this i got this i got this like everything is falling and I thought all right I'm in good shape I am completely winning and all I have to do here is take if she takes I take if she goes here I'll play D3 I'll play E3 I'll play Knight C I'll take the pawn if I really want to I am completely winning so I take the pawn realizing I hang up backwards Fork so like Knight F5 is just there apparently the best move after Knight F5 is just losing the entire Rook forcing the king to the back Rank and doing this and somehow black is playing for a win uh but I blundered she went Rook F7 and then I went here she played this and I'm like am I gonna lose this game so now it's full panic mode we both got less than 10 seconds I'm like yo she's she's straight up threatening to win the game if I'm not careful so I gave a check because that's what you do when you have low time and you don't know what to do with yourself you do the same thing I gave another check and then I realized wait a minute I I think I'm just straight up losing uh and then I realized she could go here but she did this and and I just thought the game was over uh I I truly I was like I can't go here because there I can't go here because there so so what do I do I didn't know what to do so I went here now I'm losing now I'm losing uh I'm losing because my Rook is hanging and I thought well that's not so bad I'll go over here it's mating two uh she just has Checkmate in two moves like it's just on the board um the Rooks look like they're going down this way no this Rook wants to make way for Rook f8 Rook C7 is game over it's just made rookie three I didn't see that during the game but I assumed I was losing I just didn't know how the good news for me is she also didn't know how she also she played her Cafe the average rating of this of this game is something like 22.50 um yeah uh nobody knows how to play chess because again I played the egg King V7 and now my king runs out and and now my king runs all the way out to A5 and now I'm winning so you know sometimes uh you know uh King B King here uh rook and then you don't get mated and then your king Runs Out to the vacation house Knight to B5 is now re-threatening Checkmate so before I defend myself I push the King backwards um and now at this point I'm seeing you know Rook A7 so I play the move A6 and and I'm like well I'm attacking her Knight now she goes Rook A7 and uh Rook H1 is Checkmate now I don't see the move Rook H1 at this point I do not see it's a legal move because I'm looking at this and this and pushing my Pawn I'm also trying to take that I am also trying to run with my king I'm in full panic mode like I just survived Checkmate my king is in a bunker on the edge of the board Rook H1 is made because Rook F1 a move ago it wasn't because the Rook could defend and I do this which lucky for me is still winning my idea was C takes King takes uh and now I'm just winning because I have more pawns and my king is safe fortunately as I play Knight takes Pawn I out loud say wait a minute and I realized I had a Checkmate also a guy spectating the live game said oh my God he missed Checkmate which you know you probably shouldn't say uh but it doesn't matter even if she stops it uh the night is moving in and I'm winning but but fortunately for me uh I found Checkmate this was an awful chess game uh it really was I mean it was very fun but um I I did not enjoy getting myself into a five seconds on the clock situation then proceeding to throw the game that was not very fun uh but she missed it and I got to play an egg and I and I didn't even get that bad of a position it took me a little while but I got back into the game and egg is op and if you haven't seen my video on the egg you should watch the video on the egg and uh yeah I I got a pretty decent endgame and and then I had violent diarrhea uh and and the opening was violent so you know it we inflicted a decent amount of psychological uh pressure and uh pit off so hopefully you enjoyed the video the live games um I do go outside I highly recommend you go outside as well uh and um and that's all I have for you today uh get out of here
