Well, we're really pleased to have reached the milestone of π million subscribers, here's the moment imagined at YouTube headquarters. [alarm sounds] We'd like to thank everybody who helps make the videos, who appears in the videos, and, of course, most importantly... You! The people who watch the videos. And to celebrate the occasion, some of our friends are going to help us remind you of what some of those first digits of π are. Starting, of course, with three point... I think you probably get the idea now, and as an extra "thank you" to those people who sent in some digits, I've uploaded some outtakes, so you can see just how hard it is counting from 0 to 9. Also, see the description for details of all the people in today's video, and hopefully we'll see you again really soon. And, of course, it's not too late to subscribe. We want to get to τ million one day.
