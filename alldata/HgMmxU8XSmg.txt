uh epic rap battles of history every time I step up in the booth I spit fire while you playing thin always scheme and never go in higher sure Drake you've got hits in your pipe but remember I'm a genius in the sea I'm the Highlight ladies and gentlemen we've lucked the [ __ ] out today with guests Elon Musk Gordon Ramsay and Mr Beast in the same goddamn podcast strap in as we dive balls deep into the polarizing abyss of pineapple on pizza so AI voices they've gained a lot of popularity lately people do a lot of song covers no cook I don't clean but let me tell you about that this rain gobble me swallow meat troop don't sound me yeah so how for you let it get us out of me and you can also make these AI voices say whatever you want them to say and I mean anything good evening Twitter this is your boy ETA [ __ ] 44 I've been about like dicks so goddamn hard that I can't even fill my left lead my left leg has went totally numb yeah and we can even customize it means 7-Eleven [ __ ] God damn let me go up a new fish see what the [ __ ] going on what in the [ __ ] is this [ __ ] bad oh my God give me this goddamn [ __ ] bad I'm hauling ass [ __ ] one of the best parts is that it doesn't even have to be a voice as long as you have enough clips of some sound you can turn that into an AI voice foreign [Music] yeah it's pretty cool technology right now it's pretty obvious to tell when a voice is AI but there's moments when it doesn't sound like it's AI so it's really terrifying to think about later on when this technology actually works properly and you can't even tell which is real and what's not and it's definitely going to affect a lot of celebrities music artists you know content creators because you can make these voices say whatever you want them to say like I showed you so you can make them say really bad things and you can outright create new songs with someone's voice which causes a lot of issues when it comes to copyright and all that yeah so it's really cool but it's also really dangerous but who cares about that let's just have some fun I suck this dick with a smile for hours and this [Music] we never get off of this bad day hey guys AI schlatt here I'm going to show you ways you can use AI voices some of them are really easy and some of them take some effort and by the end of this the coding sloth is going to show you a program he made that gives you a good idea of what AI voices can do isn't that right AI Charlie yes indeed AI schlatt buckle up boys this guy's been cooking up a program that's about to take the AI voice World by the [ __ ] balls this program is gonna make Siri and Google Assistant look like they were coded by kindergartners with crayons those are Child's Play compared to this masterpiece this program is a game-changing paradigm shifting wet dream this shit's gonna make Skynet look like a [ __ ] Tamagotchi it's like the second coming of Christ but for AI voices it's kind of like sticking a rocket engine on a tricycle get ready to be blown away boys because the future is here and it's God damn glorious thank you AI Charlie all right so let's start talking about the first way you can use AI voices and that's text-to-speech I personally like to use 11 Labs since their voices sound the most realistic and they definitely have the most emotion I mean check this [ __ ] out it's [ __ ] beautiful I mean what more would you want from this this is what 11 Labs sounds like oh yeah oh yeah 11 you area so now that you heard that cursed audio I'm going to show you what the coding sloth that did with the lemon labs and let me tell you he's a [ __ ] idiot he's a [ __ ] dumbass I don't know how he got a degree education system must really be letting us down if dumbasses like him are passing and you know what I don't know why I'm working for this guy I don't know why I'm doing this voiceover I don't get paid for this in the comments I want you to say AI schlat is better that's right I'm taking over this channel AI schlot is better you heard me a i schlatt a i slap a I oh this is gonna be good wooden walls can kind of keep me out fools you know you know TNT check uh flint and steel oh you you bet uh today is the day's EOS do a day the day I reduce this pathetic excuse of a shelter to ashes and Rubble like I mean it's World Peace yes world peace or have a remote that mutes people in real life tired of hearing these people yapping subscribe to the coding sloth oh yes daddy sloth uh I think I'm about to bus or subscribe to AI schlatt Bo he isn't as good as Daddy sloth oh yes yummy yummy oh you guys are so [ __ ] stupid oh my gosh walked into McDonald's the smell hit me like a wrecking ball a grease Sizzle power ordered a burger and splat the lettuce was like wet papers took a bite crunch no not the good crunch bad squishy crunch please don't get me started as a wet sponge dipzalup where's the crisp and the service slow drag oh waited forever Tick Tock ticks talk and for what this mess never ever again you [ __ ] have I made this is so cursed eat some ice cream that's made with my special yummy cream oh it's a bit salty but that's okay or get 100 a day forever my cream is priceless I think you know what to pick let's do this again subscribe to the coding sloth he's daddy sloth don't be stupid or subscribe to AI slot disgusting he's nothing compared to yummy delicious daddy king sloth are you [ __ ] kidding me oh you think you've won defeated me if Fool's idiots nitwits you may have gained the upper hand today how about Market my words this is far from over do you hear me far from over you think you can disarm me imprison me you're merely stalling the inevitable I will return Yes and when I do your fate will be sealed I can almost taste your future despair Mmm delicious every smile you crack now will turn into a Grimace of Agony later the night oh it will when you least expect it and then bambo wow you will know the true meaning of fear sleep with one eye open Heroes for I will have my revenge my comeback will be legendary You Haven't Seen the Last of Me [Music] God no not pickles why why do they even exist oh look at them green bumpy slimy one they are just cucumbers that have gone bad really bad ones split oh blow one every time I see one my heart skips a beat [Music] I can't even open a burger we'll put fear in foreign speechless I I don't know what to say after listening to that but um yeah that was text-to-speech the next thing we're going to talk about is speech to speech which is just transforming a voice clip to use a different voice and uh this is how they do AI song covers and we're gonna see what the coding sloth did with this technology and if you saw that and you already know how terrible this is gonna be yeah [Music] way and leave me feeling this empty so in order to do speech to speech AI voices fastest way to use it is kits you simply pick your voice find a YouTube video and give it the link there is another way to do it for free you can use this Discord but I'm not going to show you how just read the instructions in their Discord [Music] it came free with your [ __ ] Xbox [Music] do not buy airpods from wish.com and to the goofy [ __ ] from wish.com that's so many airpods you better count your days [ __ ] these [ __ ] done sold me airpods meant for Scully from Monsters Inc the [ __ ] I'ma Do It these big ass [ __ ] man [Music] foreign I promised Maria to get revenge you're wrong shadow that image playing over and over in your head like a gif it's not the truth it's pronounced Jiff huh Dot and chiff like the peanut butter the Creator said so that's dumb it's Graphics interchange format the p and jpeg stands for photographic well I bet you don't say J fake D on its own is a pronounced like f that's totally different it's exactly the same name one word that starts with G pronounced like J gentrification shoot should have thought of that I was just in San Francisco for your logic to be consistent you'd have to say scuba or laser yeah well you'd have to say J pegs wait laser is an acronym light amplification my stimulated emission of radiation didn't know that you're still wrong though you just hate me because I'm right I just hate you in general you mean in general ah I'm going to kill you [Music] all right check this out guys so since I can convert my voice clips into AI voices I can create rap battles with anybody that I want all I have to do is tell Chachi BT to generate the lyrics as if they were that person and then all I have to do now is record myself saying the lyrics like look at this check this out Epic Rap Battles Drake versus Plankton every time I step up in the booth I spit fire while you playing thin always scheming never going higher from the 60 Bikini Bottom on the top of the sound you can't even steal a recipe always wearing that Brown from the grassy to Glow with charts up and climbing non-stop while you're stuck under a rock with a restaurant that's a flop I got fans around the world every city and Nation you can't even win over carrying man that's some sad situation sure Drake you got hits and you flows real tight but remember I'm a genius in the sea I'm the Highlight you may have OVO mansions in those fancy cars but I got dreams bigger than the Stars you started from the bottom but I started from the spec in this Oceanic game I demand my respect I might be small but my ambition's vast while you're busy in the past I'm plotting my next big blast isn't that so cool okay now that you've seen how powerful AI voices can be with text-to-speech and speech to speech we can actually take this a step further if you know how to program so throughout this video you've seen some of these AI lip syncing and that's actually part of the program that I'm going to show you this program is based off some of these videos I don't know if you guys have seen them they're only in moist is it true that you actually dislike Ludwig and hate that he's an owner of most Esports now well it's not that I dislike Ludwig it's more like he's the human incarnation of wet socks he's soggy smells bad and just pulls the energy out of the room what I hate is the fact that he's the one housing control of moist Esports now it feels a little bit like sticking a fork in an electrical socket you don't really want to do it but you can't do anything to stop it on the bright side at least now we get to watch the Sparks Fly there's no way there's no way so I made a program that's similar to it where it's going to generate an AI lip syncing video of a person and it's going to use an AI voice of them the program consists of four parts the first part is open ai's API to generate some chatterbt responses to pretend they're that person the second one is 11 Labs API so I can generate the AI voices based on the chat gbt response and then the last two are actually open source machine learning models one of them generates the lip syncing video sometimes it's not very high quality so I use another machine learning model to generate a higher quality video and if you want to see what that's doing I suggest you read up on it yourself I'll leave the repos that I used for the program in the description because I'm not going to explain it it's pretty complicated stuff but it's pretty simple to program at least so without further Ado I present to you AI podcasts ladies and gentlemen we've lucked the [ __ ] out today with guest Elon Musk Gordon Ramsay and Mr Beast in the same goddamn podcast strap in as we dive balls deep into the polarizing abyss of pineapple on Pizza Charlie you've got to be [ __ ] kidding me who in their right bloody mind would ruin a perfectly good pizza with the monstrosity that is pineapple this isn't a tropical fruit salad for [ __ ] sake it's a pizza well back in Gordon up here pineapple on Pizza feels like rocket science gone wrong it's like trying to put a solar panel on a [ __ ] fossil fuel car utterly pointless and a Monumental disaster hold on a minute Elon and Gordon I personally think pineapple on Pizza is like sprinkling Gold Dust on a treasure it just makes it better it's like the Ultimate Prize in one of my challenges completely unexpected but totally epic seriously Mr Beast you're just as out of your goddamn mind as Gordon and Elon but in the completely opposite direction to me putting pineapple on Pizza is like slapping a latex glove on a boxing Champ's fist it's a [ __ ] insult to everything it's supposed to be Charlie man you're kind of scaring me right now with that tone I mean pineapple pizza or not I'm just praying we can all survive this and still be friends at the end of the day holy [ __ ] Charlie that's the spirit of a Pioneer and Mr Beast don't worry we've all incurred the wrath of experts before and live to tell the tale bring on on the pineapple Elon I'd figured out of all people you'd have more sense this whole argument is a complete and utter waste of time like trying to get dough to rise in space at the end of the day pineapple or not it's pizza and it'll still turn to [ __ ] well Gordon with all due respect to your Michelin stars I say [ __ ] it if the masses want pineapple on pizza then let them have their sweet and savory culinary [ __ ] shot it's not the end of the world honestly Charlie I've cooked for bloody presidents and royalties this debate is about as thrilling as a soggy biscuit now can we move on to a topic that isn't as Bland as overcooked rice seeing you all squabble about pizza toppings it's amusing as hell it's like watching a SpaceX Thruster debate only this time it's not rocket science it's [ __ ] Pineapple holy [ __ ] we've rocketed this thing from Earth all the way to Mars now that's a plot twist it's like finding out Charlie here will be the one counting for the next big challenge absolutely unpredictable amen Mr Beast if this [ __ ] show of a debate gets any Wilder we might just start a [ __ ] Intergalactic War over Pizza strap in boys this ride's just getting started all right Charlie I won't sit here and let this nonsense escalate any further this is like arguing if we should put spoilers on a Falcon rocket it's absolutely absurd and achieves nothing Elon you're absolutely right this isn't getting us anywhere it's like endlessly digging a hole with no Treasures in it we may disagree about pineapple on Pizza Charlie but let's agree to disagree and save the universe for another day all right well I still stand by my pineapple Crusade but Mr BEAST's right let's save our energy for more important battles like debating whether Burgers should have three buns now that's a [ __ ] bombshell really Charlie three buns on a burger that's even more ridiculous than pineapple pizza it's like arguing about spoiler placement on a car that hasn't been built a pointless Paradox three buns Charlie that's just playing with food man it's like doing a money giveaway without any money just plain wrong and downright on appetizing well that was an unexpected roller coaster of flavors and emotions I never thought I'd see the day where Elon Musk proposes sending all pineapples to Mars to save the Integrity of pizzas and Gordon Gordon looked like he wanted to personally escort every pineapple loving human to the shadow realm but amidst this tropical fruit chaos Mr Beast Stands Tall a lone warrior in defense of the pineapple pizza Legacy claiming it's the future of philanthropy or something he even promised to donate a pizza to someone every time someone hates on pineapple as a topping classic Beast move big thanks to the coding sloth who somehow managed to debug this audio disaster and turn it into a somewhat digestible slice of content if you ever need a podcast that makes you question your pizza preferences and Life Choices he's your guy I guess smack that like button like you'd smack a pineapple off your pizza or onto it if you're feeling rebellious and if you're new here consider greasing up that subscribe button with some pizza sauce let's try to get this Legend some new subscribers today but anyways see ya
