what's up guys i'm going to be attempting to set the world record for the longest uber ride ever i'm currently here in north carolina as you can tell from my professionally drawn map and i'm going to take an uber from north carolina all the way to california in one trip and we're going to set the world record lydia so as you can see we are currently in north carolina i'm not lying this is google maps and we're gonna go all the way to california okay so i forgot to hit record but as you can see i called in uber and as you can see our current trip is to los angeles we're going to do this in one ride or at least we're going to try to and set a world record it's going to take us from north carolina to california before i do that i just want to mention this entire video is paid for by quid quit is an app i'm going to play an ad for them real quick and they are the ones that are paying for this trip hey past me i'm actually at the hotel i just got finished with this uber ride and you won't believe how much it ended up costing but this is an app where you basically can open up packs of stickers from your favorite shows and believe it or not i actually have my own packs so you should download quit it's linked at the top of description go open up some mr beast packs and see what mr b stickers you can collect and the fun part about the app is you actually can spam your friends with your favorite stickers and cards from the shows is the sandwich good you're taking forever okay i mean to be frank i'm we're looking to go to california do you have that kind of time or do i need those things yeah i'm not joking but we can put in shorter stops to lead up but that's our end goal we're looking for someone to take us to california all right so we just got up with the first uber as you can see he's uh right there he's calling his wife to see if she'll let him do it all right guys so he just agreed to do it this is going to be the man taking us from north carolina to california thank you you're going to give me a viral video thank you let's do it i need the money you know yeah so salamis hoover is paying me that i'm fine if not hey guys so it's currently 7 30 on thursday night so far not much has happened it's only really been an hour you know we still got a long ways to go so we were just talking and actually tell what you do for a living yeah i'm a truck driver yeah so he actually drives trucks so it's kind of ironic that uh we matched up with this guy he actually has experience driving for a really long time you plan on taking us all the way to california right uh yes yeah he's a little camera shy we'll work on it as you can see we're about to cross the four hour mark davis what do you think so far gonna be a long ride yeah dude it's only been four hours and jeez how about you you still hanging in there oh yeah are you good you all right you want to get us there alive oh come on guys on the way so we got philip number one how are you doing so far doing pretty good yeah feeling good right as you can see we just crossed the 10 hour mark we've literally been going for about 10 hours so far which is just kind of funny like you've literally just been driving complete strangers for the last 10 hours like what do you do yes that is true let's train the strangers with an objective all right so we're at the second gas stop as you can see we're filling up we're uh we're getting us some gas right now this is our second time filling up we're about 10 hours into our like 45 hour ride and you know we're all pretty tired but we're gonna make this happen we are going to set a world record i got a call man if i come in i'm gonna have a bike situation i'm laying down in the back of the van just taking a nap i'm tired as [ __ ] and uh yeah there probably won't be much footage from this state look open as you guys can see arkansas is just fields upon fields upon fields there's literally nothing here but just a ton of fields all right guys so we're in arkansas i think it's phillip number three we're here at a crackle barrel we're gonna go inside and just eat some food and kill some time while he catches up on sleep because it's been like 13 hours or something crazy like that so yeah yeah we were there for quite a while yeah yes he got like a good two and a half hour to happen hopefully he doesn't fall asleep at the wheel now and we should be good yeah oklahoma now all we did in high school was play this game called balloon tower defense like literally every class we played it and so i just just like back in high school i'd kick his butt one literature class where literally the entire class the entire year all we did was play this game almost at the halfway mark um all right you you regretting this what are your thoughts oh yes i believe the current world record for the longest uber ride is a ride from dallas to nashville which was actually 11 and a half hours 6 500 miles uh i've done a lot of research and from what i see this is the longest ride i can find quick update that is oklahoma city over there those uh giant buildings all right so this is a rough you know this is an outside view of the mansion i'll give you a look inside the house got a nice torch here give me some light close the door at night and i'm ready to go so apparently we're in texas we didn't actually see a sign for it so uh i guess somehow we missed that you've been driving now for almost literally an entire day straight what what what are you thinking how's it going it's going wonderful is it like um is this easier than you thought it would be a harder uh no it's pretty much not what i oh yeah cool tell the viewers something about mr b yes he is awesome he's the beast and his crew they're not even spinning maybe i'm for example trump make him work hey davis who just won i'll let him win that time yeah uh-huh we're about to be below 1000 miles left on our trip which is a huge milestone we started off with 3 000 so uh we've done about two-thirds of it so far new mexico boys we took an exit to get some gas and this is what we were confronted with we're just the middle of a desert yeah that's number four so that was just our fourth time filling up we got some food we you know used the bathroom and we've got another like 14 hours left in the drive so um you ready to grind it up oh yes all right look he's been killing it i don't i don't know how he has it we called him on uber like his wife had cooked up food and he had to eat him yeah he had eaten dinner he was in work clothes and we were just like hey can you drive us to california i'll pay you a lot of money and he's like he called his wife and talked to his wife for like literally two hours i was just like all right come on mr beast didn't know that was actual us state so yeah i actually didn't know new mexico was a state i thought they were playing a prank on me but we have just under 10 hours left it's looking like the entire trip will be around 37 hours so it's this hasn't been too bad i mean what do you guys think awesome it's been amazing guys we just arrived at the gas station um he's filling up we're gonna get some gas and this is my boat we're now in arizona this is our last state until california um yeah i'm ready to be done all right we're filling up again i think this was like was this like our sixth time fill it up yeah so it literally only took us six times to get from coast to coast which isn't that bad all right guys so i'm a terrible blogger uh i always forget to record things but actually we just pulled into the hotel here in california so what that actually means is you just drove us all the way from north carolina to california in 40 hours yes of the world was was it hard what do you think well it was uh a lot of it was it was tedious do you think the ride home will suck i will need to take a lot of rest probably about another 40 hours ago oh yes jesse wake up we're here hey how much did it cost jimmy oh yeah that's a good one i actually almost forgot to bring that up so the ride from north carolina to california uh with him for 40 hours it was 40 hours from north carolina to california it was about 5 500 dollars that's what it cost only 5 500 yeah i know actually we kind of we thought it would be like ten thousand dollars somehow somehow we got away with only paying you five grand i'm kidding i'm kidding man uh we gave him a big tip he already saw it all so he got a victim that already had the reaction and stuff but yes you don't like plates it's about five and a half grand to go from coast to coast um that's probably valuable information and that may be the longest uber trip is it yeah that's definitely from what i've seen i've done a lot of researching like 10 minutes on google uh the longest trip before this was like 13 hours and we just did it was about 39 to be exact from north carolina to california yeah we made sure it was worth as well don't worry guys uh anything you want to say well uh whenever you guys want to do this again please let you know let me know if anyone else wants a cross-country trip just hit him up guys thank you oh this has been drawn out we're gonna go to sleep yeah it it it was a pleasure tell them to subscribe yeah and uh everybody subscribe these guys are awesome that's right that's right all right we're done
