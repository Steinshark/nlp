monstrous game sacrificing pieces two brilliant moves 97% accuracy he played an incredible game I'm going to show it to you and then I'm going to show you the Tweet actually three tweets that Magnus put out after the game concluded and it's not exactly what you think Magnus made no accusations whatsoever against his opponent the bigger question was his opponent was wearing a watch during the game watches are not allowed in these tournaments they are against International Chess Federation regulations and Magnus even brought it up to the Arbiter the referee who said his opponent was allowed to wear a watch because it wasn't a smart watch it was an analog watch that is what this cheating scandal is all about his opponent played a fantastic game this is not on the level of the other one but let's jump into this game we got to also give credit to this young kazak grandmas I sat next to alisher sulov a couple of years ago four years ago at this point uh in the Czech Republic good player uh let's take a look at this game then let's take a look at magnus's uh social media post afterwards and he does bring up a valid issue so alisher began with D4 Magnus went for uh a queen's Indian defense with Pawn to B6 one of the ways of developing the light scored bishop and then the dark squ Bishop will come out over here and then alisher played this move A3 very simple he just wants wants to prevent black from ever putting a bishop on the B4 Square okay uh Bishop to A6 Queen to C2 defending the pawn and now Magnus goes back he didn't want to put the bishop there in the first place because the queen wouldn't have moved so this is one of the ways of making the queen not have defense of the D5 Square now Magnus plays C5 alisher plays this very aggressive move E4 in the center of the board his idea is to grab the center and basically punish Magnus for baiting the Queen out this way right Magnus is saying well your queen is now not controlling the def file so alisher says okay well your setup allows me to play this move Pawn to E4 now Magnus takes takes and plays Bishop to C5 and here the main line is Knight to B3 targeting the bishop but alisher plays Knight to F3 retreating the Knight back this way and now in this position there's a really really absurd line which is Knight to G4 and that is actually very difficult to defend F2 I don't think white wants to undevelop this night although it is a possibility there's actually a line here according to the computer where you can actually allow this Knight in and like try to trap it here it's it's really weird stuff clearly alisher knew that this was a move because he spent almost no time on Knight F3 but Magnus played Knight C6 Magnus actually spent five minutes here uh he did not choose to go for Knight to G4 which might be the critical move but it's not the it might lead to a force draw sometimes in the opening if you try to be too aggressive Rive and forceful things happen and they actually backfire so Magnus chooses to play Knight to C6 alisher plays B4 kicking out his bishop and you can kind of see here already Magnus is very passive like white has three pawns out on the front ranks he's fighting for for for activity in the center and now Magnus plays this move Queen to B8 now to the untrained eye that looks beyond stupid but it's got a point the idea is that he's going to follow up with D6 to fight for the center and after castling he's he's going to put his Rook here and this setup by black with a bunch of Pawns on the sixth rank is called the Hedgehog spiky a spiky little setup a little bit difficult for white to break through the way white wants to break through against that opening is to try to create some sort of attack right so Rook to D1 played by alisher you see he's now spending time right he spends about 10 minutes 12 minutes developing the bishop and then Rook D1 and Magnus castles and alisher goes Bishop to E2 it's crazy he had to spend 16 minutes on that move he was probably calculating other things maybe like G3 Bishop G2 maybe putting the bishop on D3 you're playing Magnus you spend 16 minutes moving a bishop one square terrific and now here we have the setup so alisher brings his second Rook Magnus undevelop the bishop to uh the f8 square potentially to go there in the future also to just defend this and use this as a transfer point and alisher does the exact same thing his Bishop is doing a good job on that diagonal from F1 to A6 uh especially if this pawn moves and the Rooks are powerful this is the position here Magnus started getting provocative because again black is not really in a situation here to call shots right he's like a little bit passive kind of sitting there waiting so Magnus plays Knight to E7 he plays it quickly look at he doesn't really lose any time Alish sure now realizes okay black is very passive I mean it's Magnus so you know Magnus is is doing what arisna did against Pereira right he's up against the fence he's going like this and when you overextend he's going to come over the top and he's going to knock you out so alisher hesitates for a while and plays Knight B5 he spends 18 minutes on that move because you're like I Magnus is luring me into something so he goes after the pawn on D6 but this was always magnus's idea right now Magnus is going to transfer the Knight here and defend that pawn kick the Knight out and then start firing away but Magnus at this point plays Knight E8 so he brings that Knight back and then that Knight back too he's bringing both Knights out of the front lines to the back and after Knight to B5 which simultaneously pressures this pawn and also opens up this bishop alisher says you know what these Knights are now gone from their outposts and I got some you know what about Knight G5 with a very simple idea E5 Queen H7 Pawn to H6 looks possible but there's sacrifices looming in the position so Magnus thinks and plays Knight G6 he finishes the transfer of the Knight right that Knight went there to transfer it's transferred now he's probably going to kick this Knight out now alisher still plays E5 uhoh what's this Pawn to E5 anyway the idea is very simple the queen has opened up so the Knight has no ability to capture if you take like this I play Bishop takes E5 and look at that Queen something about the positions off like magnus's peace coordination is a bit all over the place right so what does Magnus do here his best move might be A6 kicking out the Knight or Rook to d8 restructuring the center but Magnus lashes out and alisher just moves his Queen off of the pin with the idea to play here and here and threaten mate and this is only plus 1.3 but on low depth it's plus five on a high depth not low depth if you let the computer think this the game is over Magnus Carlson is completely lost how like I don't where's the I mean there's no Checkmate right black will defend himself he's losing because of this alisher sulov in this position sacrifices the Knight the Knight infiltrates the castle you have to take it otherwise it's going to rotate around and you can't even win the Knight and it takes a very valuable Pawn you've got to look at pawns protected only by the king why is is this so good because after King takes F7 he just shreds open the position he has two cannons pointed down the center line his Bishop anchors the center Pawn the Knight is ready to gallop in or Gallop around and go there the queen is ready to transfer sideways or diagonally forward and these pieces are just trapped Magnus plays Bishop takes D5 it would not be a wonderful game of chess if someone didn't sacrifice The Rook Rook takes D5 is a bulldozzer and that's it alisher is winning back his material he got the Knight back Magnus can take Queen takes D5 alisher is down a full Rook but the King has nowhere to go there is only one legal move in this position and now simply Knight to D4 Knight E6 check is a monster threat Rook to E3 Rook F3 is simple but effective Bishop to C4 in the future is simple but effective there is no way for Magnus to fight back he has all of these incredible pieces and none of them can do anything he can't trade Queens he can't stop White's bulldozer Knight f four Magnus pins the Knight to the king uh alisher pins the Knight to the king I'm so used to speaking for Magnus winning Queen to F4 Magnus has to just give up the Knight to survive but now he is down two pawns and a bishop for a rook and none of these pieces have moved Queen to B7 alisher just keeps going forward the attack literally plays itself it's completely playing itself Magnus now plays B5 trying to just secure the position alisher takes the pawn is just hanging because Queen takes B5 you relinquish your defense of this and oh my goodness Bishop takes B5 Magnus brings the bishop back check you can't take cuz it's defended and now the game ends Knight to H6 you cannot take the Knight because Queen takes f8 you have absolutely no way to defend anything you can play Queen to E7 and then I will play check King G8 and I will probably just slide my Bishop back play Knight D6 and slowly execute you along this it's unbelievable Magnus Carlson resigned after Knight to H6 this is his lowest rated classical chess defeat in nearly 20 years Al sh Su manov played a fantastic game fantastic game and he was given that opportunity because of a slightly KY opening approach by Magnus just you know Magnus just played a little bit provocatively that's basically all he did with this move like Knight E7 but alisher had to find Knight B5 and Knight G5 and he just went at him I mean the horses just went on their little journey Epic sacrifice on F7 realizing the attacking possibilities and then Rook takes D5 it's very rare we see games like this so you know naturally when this happens you're like oh my God what a game Magnus played not that great this game it happens all right we want to Hype Magnus up I mean I want to Hype Magnus up you guys really enjoy those uh videos where Magnus completely you know outclasses opponents but sometimes he loses and then uh there you know there's this meme now that every time Magnus loses he's going to say something you know cheating whatever but that's not not that's this is all just memes but then out comes this tweet and now I have Logan Paul on my sidebar here um out comes this tweet I was completely crushed in my game today this is not to accuse my opponent of cheating who played an absolutely amazing game uh and deserve to win but honestly as soon as I saw my opponent was wearing a watch early in the game I lost my ability to concentrate now some of you might be reading that going a watch like what that's the rule I obviously take responsibility for my inability to deal with those thoughts properly but it's also ibly frustrating to see organizer still not taking antiche seriously at all there's no broadcast DeLay So the moves are live broadcasted and Spectators walking around the playing Hall with smartphones okay more information and then Magnus said I did ask an Arbiter whether watches were allowed and he clarified smart watches were banned but not analog watches and this seems to be against Fay rules so Chris bird is an Arbiter works with the St Louis chess club and I think just an international Arbiter uh very very very uh I think reputable source and he quotes the fedale handbook that says a player's forbidden to have any electronic device and the anti-cheating regulations add wallets smart glasses pens and watches which is crazy because that sounds like some James Bond stuff um this is uh olympu I think olympu uran and he um he's a chess historian and he you know has a little thing here that says nice watch and that's you know that's the that that this is I'm not I'm not condoning anything like alisher played a fantastic game alisher is Just unfortunately going to be the opponent from which this kind of breaks out this is the handbook sorry for the light mode F doesn't have a dark mode uh this is the quote uh that says you cannot have electronic devices and in the anti-cheating regulations it says other Fairplay violations are bringing a phone into the playing hall or other forbidden gadgets like a wallet of smart glasses pens and watches I went to the Qatar chess website I was unable to find anything in particular um but multiple people have now weighed in on this uh Maxim Vash uh French Grandmaster weighed in uh and he and I and I'm going to pull that up for you in a second and we're going to get into the other games as well there there's a few other games from this round that I would like to cover uh but it is important to uh it is important to bring some of this stuff up um so let me just pull this out for you over here first of all Hikaru in an interview said I go to my games and I wear two rings you know he wears uh I guess he has like a like a ring that he wears and I wedding ring cuz he is married someone could say he put something in his Rings right the whole notion of not being able to concentrate when someone is wearing an analog watch it's a sign Magnus is not as mentally strong as he once was wow that is that is intense I mean that that listen that's he and hikaro thinks that Magnus of 10 years ago would have destroyed his opponent without you know hesitating but then mvl said I absolutely agree with this take players need to unite to get anti-cheating measures in place at every tournament to hinder cheaters and um he Sayang alisher play played a completely fair and legitimate game so again alisher completely legitimate no question he just had a watch on that like because he wears a watch because he's a norm he just wears a watch because a lot of people wear watches um so this is again going back to Big Picture stuff in chess there is absolutely no consistency anywhere anywhere in the world of Chess it could be online it could be offline there was no players union there are too many organizations that put on chess tournaments there is no uh you know while there is an international government body of the game f who puts out a handbook the rules are not even followed the apparently that's what it was said the Arbiter told him that a watch could be worn I don't think a tournament of that stature with that many excellent players can overrule de feat a handbook I you know you're a local tournament allow Watchers you have a little tournament at your local library you don't need somebody there going take your damn watch off that's not what we're but this is different and that's what that's what we have now I I don't think Magnus is withdrawing that's not what that was but uh Spectators walking around the playing Hall with smartphones that you know I get it it's 2023 chess kind of has to modernize like we got to find some sort of solution in the world of chess for this but um but yeah this is uh this this is what happened today I uh I can't believe we're here again but but we are alisher plays an ex excellent game of chess uh but Magnus does point out that uh he is uh you know he is wearing something that is on the list of things that you cannot wear he voices it with the Arbiter Magnus and um he he he let the intrusive thoughts win and the Arbiter did not acknowledge uh What uh you know and um that's weird I mean this is a massive existential threat to chess cheating um and just the worries of it the concerns of it the paranoia about it it's a wild time and um look it's happening live can you imagine online I mean it's it's crazy stuff all right my friends uh hikaro is also playing in this tournament so let's uh let's go through this game um Hikaru on board two playing against D changan how is there a Grandmaster from China ch.com there's no profile picture of this guy come on every time I make a recap and there's like Grand Masters and international Masters that don't have a profile photo I'm going to complain here and hopefully we find a photo of Da Chong Ren I don't know who I I I don't I don't know I don't know who this person is I think this is like a young Grandmaster from China uh which means we got to get a photo all right hikaro went night F3 Bishop C4 Bishop C5 and hikaro played an Italian with Pawn to D3 uh it was a very close structure black routed his Queen side Knight over to the king side very typical of the Italian very tense position and now uh Chung randai played Knight H5 and Knight to F4 planting a knight firmly in front of hikaru's King hikaro plays Bishop to F1 and black plays F6 Little Rock Rock Solid structure and now Hikaru realized you know what it's it's kind of a frozen moment on the board right black is kind of rerouting and playing so let me let me kick his Knight out I don't really like where his Knight is let me slide my queen over to C2 and now D5 so a lot of maneuvering in this game it takes 20 moves for a pieace trait to happen between hikaro and uh Chang randai Knight to G5 we trade and Hikaru attacks on the queen side with Pawn to B4 trying to take space trying to move over there the double G pawns do open up the file but how is he going to move any pieces out of the way of his Rook the Knight is stuck he might have to play Knight F4 and just like sack the Knight and try to attack but Hikaru is blocking the bishop this bishop is blocked by everything and Hikaru just slowly improves his position on the queen side and uh black plays H6 Hikaru brings the bishop to C4 now he's ready to go here again if the position clears out hikaro is going to have an a pawn right like just very very hypothetically speaking I'm not saying this is the best move but I am just saying like that's an outside pass Pawn that is a massive asset in every endgame right so Hikaru is going to have to prepare that now black plays CD CD leaves 211 that is a massive trade by Chang randai he takes on D5 now Karu transfers the bishop to the center of the board with pressure here Bishop's eyeing this way remember Hikaru completely neutralized the attack that was happening toward his King on that side and and um Queen D3 Knight C4 all the pieces are transferring in that direction that pawn is hanging but you can't really take this Pawn because if Bishop takes F7 and a fork so that would not work you got to take that first Knight E3 you still can't take the pawn because if Rook takes this take take uh take uh if hikaro would have taken on C1 potentially you can do this but mean you're getting slaughtered here with the Knight coming to F5 and that is exactly what hikaro does that is called a vichan zuk an in between move before he takes Back The Rook he counterattacks the Queen the queen moves and a dominant position if Rook takes A4 was played hikaro would play Rook to C8 and attraction sacrifice and Knight E7 would be a fork or even Rook C7 everything is winning here because of the power of the pieces Knight to F6 take hikaro grabs the pawn he's got two pass pawns on the queen side now and the game is over black Fights Back Hikaru goes for a queen trade and simple straight forward we have an end game but he is simply up a little bit too much the bishop and the Knight are good but they cannot stop to Connected past pawns Karo grabs another Pawn to go with the sauce on the side and the pawns are just going to mobilize Pawn to A5 uh apparently you know black can fight back here but uh it's going to be basically impossible you're going to have to lose one of these pawns for the piece then you will lose the second pawn and you will lose the game rather than even prolonging this black just resigned what a game by Hikaru by the way can I just say like like excellent control by hikaro here showing the level difference very controlled game black made one overly aggressive strategic mistake here playing into this structure and just how expertly and quickly Hikaru reversed everything around just awesome just super super like just excellent job from I mean he doesn't need my compliments but uh I'm going to compliment the man anyway just expertly done great control of the king side not allowing himself to be attacked controlling the queen side controlling the center just a great game an excellent game showing the level difference at GM level and Hikaru starts two out of two and he's in first place now because he's the highest rated player so he is going to be on board one he's because Magnus lost that's kind of how that goes I have two more games for you this game had one of the most disgusting conclusions I have ever seen in my life which is why I will save it for last and I'm going to show you an all India battle between SP Seth ran and Vali rames Babu who is the sister of one prananda rames Babu this one was also an Italian might look a little bit similar to that Hikaru game A4 H6 the bishop gets out of the center these Italians can be very similar but this Knight is not rotating around to G6 that is a major difference both players clearly in some degree of preparation up until this moment right so in this game little bit less locked black might play for D5 white might play for D4 pawns are going to dance on the queen side this file is a little bit open right Rook A2 white puts the knights out Vali loading up the Cannons on the f file B5 D4 Here Comes Sean 2600 he's got to take over the game so he plays B5 D4 and he improves his position over here but just like in the da Chung ren game at some point black is going to put a knight on F4 and in hearu game the KN on F4 was dealt with but that was because in the Hikaru game when the Knight arrived on the F4 Square the Rooks were not on the file so Hikaru just Consolidated and kicked out of his Knight but in this game this looks really unpleasant and now Knight G5 and now G4 oh my Vali sacrifices a pawn to bring in the queen and suddenly White's position is without any focus and without any purpose the Knight slaughtering the kingside the bishop ready to bounce through the D4 pawn and Slaughter on E3 and F2 Queen H4 is on the way look at this and now Vali just like alisher Su manov sacrifices the Knight it's a pawn only protected by a king Rook takes F2 is literally game over on the very next move so sethuraman has to defend himself the Knight jumps out and now the the coffin F3 cutting the circulation of the white position The Rook slides over to G6 she takes the pawn in the center she slides back over to F4 it's just a matter of time locking down the center the white king is going on a run but all the pawns are falling Vally two pawns up Sean down to seconds she gets in on the G file she's going to get to move 40 and now she's got 30 extra minutes on the clock to work with Queen E4 check she gives a couple of checks she's not going to play for a draw Pawn to E5 you cannot take take because of this and if you go here and then take or don't take ween E4 and white resigned because your king is going to get mercilessly hunted along the back Rank and checkmated by shal what a monster win for her beating 2600 rated sp sp sauran the rating points in India are a closed ecosystem they go from some GMS to other very good title players it's actually quite incredible to see uh great win for her a lot of upsets this round this game though absolutely brutal this is timour karov one of the highest rated players in Australia he might be the highest rated player in Australia but it also might be Anton smov I'm going to look this up right now Australia fiday the highest rated player in Australia is timour karov by a lot uh where is Anon spov I thought he was Australian it's Bobby Chang second 2572 what I'm so confused okay well I thought they had they don't have that Australian anymore I guess um E4 E5 Bishop B5 this time we have a Spanish a lot of e4s this is an open Spanish don't worry about the theory I'm not going to quiz you on it later my friends this game explodes this is a very sharp line it was played in the candidates between Hikaru and Fabiano Carana you can use that to win your local trivia night very sharp and insane system which leads to Super complicated chess where black has a rook and multiple pawns and white has two pieces right right has a bishop and a Knight Knight f one back the players threaten us with a repetition of moves Now Pawn to B3 look at Black's time black has seven extra minutes on the clock he hasn't thought that's how much Theory black knows look at this look how well prepared black is take take Bishop to E4 black finally he thinks for four minutes on that move he barely even thinks Bishop B2 Rook F4 okay there it is 23 minutes spent Rook to F4 very sharp position we threatened The Rook now we kick out this rook and now we take the Knight on the center of the board tactics all over the place Knight takes D4 you can take my Bishop on B7 but then I take your Bishop on E6 Bishop F7 now Bishop slides to C6 position is equal but very tense look at White's Knights very powerful in the center of the board is it better to trade Queens for white or black I don't know neither do the players which is why they try to keep the Queens on the board and at this point teamour goes G4 it's a big moment he's using the Pawns in front of his own King to attack black that's very rare because normally you want to to keep your king safe but the king is safe black has no way of attacking so he plays G4 maybe he's going to play G5 a little bit later brings his Rooks trades and now he's got these two powerful Knights now I told you the conclusion of this game is one of the most disgusting that I've ever seen rookie one Queen E4 he starts a fullon pawn attack nobody is remaining in front of his king queen C6 Knight to G5 and my friends Queen takes F6 G takes F6 and watch this tor kakar ends this game with Knight F7 check you cannot take because it's back rank mate and this but what about King to G8 well then his idea is to give this check Force the king back into the corner and bring his Rook but how is he going to win you can't Checkmate The Rook is covering the entire back rank there's no smothered mate Rook to C8 there is smothered mate my friends Rook to G7 Rook to G7 sets up Knight F7 Checkmate okay smothered mate we've all seen that before Rook to f8 no because the threat is Rook f8 smothered mate anyway the black king smothered in the corner by two knights two horses work together to completely paralyze the black king I have never seen something like this I have never seen a smothered mate done without a queen you sack the queen in the corner and then the king is shelled in and you play Knight F7 I have never seen an open air concept smothered mate that is so rare where the king actually has breathing room but the Knight completely seals it that Knight plays such a pivotal role in the defense of the just beautiful stuff beautiful just amazing what what more can I say um Sensational game Qatar Masters heating up no pun intended it's probably like 40° celus over in Qatar right now uh we're going to see what happens with fair play we're going to see what happens with Spectators we are going to see what happens with the existential threat that cheating and the concerns of it whether it is happening or not uh play in the future years of Chess whether the events are online or offline what type of fair play measures have to be taken do players have to submit themselves to a colonoscopy before they go to a round I don't know but we have a new development in the world of chess and cheating and um guitar Masters see you back for round number three get out of here
