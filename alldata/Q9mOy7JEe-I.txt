today I'm going to share five reasons why being a parent is actually great for your career the question is whether these are actually valid reasons because maybe I'm just trying to console myself that having kids was a great idea you know there's no way back I'll let you be the judge of Thoughts by the way an experiment this is a slightly different setup than I normally use so whenever you see me on the couch it's going to be more of a bounce or video Just Me sharing some of my personal experiences with you no code examples just having a chat I mean I could even turn this into a full-on podcast and publish it on Apple and Spotify let me know what you think in the comments now what are some of the reasons that I think being a parent is actually great for your career well the first one is that being a parent actually helps you improve your time management skills basically if you're a parent well you know kids can be very demanding very time consuming and they're going to require a lot of attention and not just that you're actually no longer in control of your own agenda basically crap can hit the fan at any point in time you never know when that's going to happen the only way to survive is to really improve your time management skills make them more resilient and that's actually a great asset for your career because when your kids get older and you they require less of your time then you are still going to have those great time management skills that you learned and then you'll be able to work way more efficiently than before now my kids are still quite young but I already do you see this happening what I found helped me most is really prioritize my task and decide what is the most important thing that I need to do that day and then simply do that thing first that way if I'm being interrupted I will probably have done the most important thing anyway so the rest it's not such a big problem the second thing is that I've become really obsessed with automation like one thing I discovered recently which is like really weird because that already exists for like 20 years is email rules and filters so I know of like at least 20 different rules and filters that automatically Mark email messages as read moved on to the correct folder for them to another email address if that's something that I want to do and this saves me loads of time it's been a complete eye opener for me a second reason that being a parent is good for your career is that you're way better organized so it's not just about time management like when my kids were younger they both had trouble sleeping and my wife and I had so many broken lights that I'm surprised that we even survived that at all but I had a period where basically I didn't trust my brain anymore and the only way for me to get worked on is by making sure I relied as much as possible on systems outside of my own brain to record information and make sure that I didn't forget anything like agendas note-taking tools to-do list Etc and once you use these tools for a while it's gonna have a huge impact on the quality of your work there's basically less things to fall through cracks a third thing that parenting does is that it enhances your problem solving skills when you have young kids well you basically always have to deal with new unknown situations and sort of deal with them so it's actually a great way to train your problem solving skills and these skills are crucial to software development where you often have to find Creative Solutions to pretty complex problems now I can't really pinpoint a particular time where I was solving a software problem and that I thought oh hey this is actually because I had to solve a problem for my kids or something but what I do notice that I've become less afraid of experimenting and just trying some crazy things and not being too afraid of failure and I do think that mindset has something to do with being a parent and seeing your kids go through the same process of failing and you know falling crying a bit getting up again and learning that way the fourth reason is that being a parent enhances your communication skills raising kids means that you need to communicate more you need to show more empathy and you have to learn to understand the needs and also explain complex things to your children in ways that they can easily understand and this skill is actually really important in a team setting where you have to explain maybe what you do or what your ideas are to your team members and that doesn't mean that your team members are like kids and you have to explain everything to like it's for a four-year-old but it still helps to think about how to explain things because by doing that you're actually also restructuring and improving the way to store that information in your own minds for me in particular since I run a YouTube channel it has helped me actually clarify my thoughts and structure my teaching more it's really about bringing a complex object back to its Essence and not turning that into a video on YouTube or into an online course like next level python a fifth reason is that parenting helps you become a better manager research has shown that parents actually perform better in the workplace especially in management jobs and that's because parenting and management skills overlap and I don't mean that most members of your team are going to behave like kids all the time although that's still possible of course but there are some skills like negotiating reaching a compromise listening to people not putting yourself at the center of everything that are so important if you want to become a good manager now you don't become automatically a great manager by just putting kids on Earth you also need to be actually involved in raising them but having kids helped me tremendously in realizing how different people are like at my time at the University Steve I had this was actually a big mindset shift for me because I was surrounded by mostly the same kind of people you know researchers interested in computer science and kids helped me broaden my Horizon a bonus reason is that parenting actually teaches you patience and resilience children can be very demanding and unpredictable and that teaches parents to be patients very patient but that's actually really valuable in a software development environment where projects can be complex and challenging I can't even remember how often it happened that I had to spend like a whole day trying to figure out some stupid problem and the most frustrating ones were always somehow related with multi-threaded code or with course issues so if you're not patient then you don't have to stamina to see these things through while they actually make all the difference in the end all of these reasons have led me to see someone being a parent as a huge asset when I'm hiring so if you're looking for a next job just make sure you have some kids before you apply just kidding if you really want to prepare for your next job especially if you want to grow into a more senior position make sure you watch this video next where I show you exactly what you should do to prepare for a senior developer job interview thanks for watching and see you soon
