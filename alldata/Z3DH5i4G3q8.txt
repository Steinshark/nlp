it is through the personal transformation of people that the world is transformed it is not firstly through political action through political activism through all these things true transformation happens through you becoming a saint if you become a saint then you will transform reality I'm not against being politically active but if you think that that's how you're going to fundamentally change reality forget it it's like let's take the United States for example like you literally have a country that's split 50/50 down the middle and then everybody's fighting for like the few percentages to win the next election and so who is winning is anybody going to win how you going to win are you going to destroy 50% of the country are you going to just eliminate everybody like this kind of culture War stuff is that's why I tried to avoid it as much as I can because the problem of the fragmentation is such a deep problem it doesn't have a political solution this is Jonathan Pedro welcome to the symbolic [Applause] world but I did want to understand more deeply what you were talking about about the Enlightenment and I guess um if the world is going to be re-enchanted then um what methodology can we use to explain the world to ourselves and each other because while the enlightenment or that bundle of thinkers and procedures that were born at that time and kind of came together while it does have problems and certainly can't explain everything it does have a way of like really drilling down into so-called OB objective truth like does like approach something more solid and when we start speaking in terms of symbolism like what is the underlying like methodology and how do you know when you're going astray how do you check your notes how do you like show your work like like a math problem like how do you like verify well how can I say this I think we're looking at two different problems right one is the problem of let's say predicting phenomena which is let's say uh quantifying and predicting phenomena is very different from understanding the very frame by which we look at reality that is the frame of uh hierarchies by which we organize the world right those are those two things are very different you could say it's the difference between a hierarchy of Virtues a hierarchy of values a hierarchy of uh importance and the the drilling down on the identities that are identified once that hierarchy is set up right so it's like I decide what's most important and then I apply the tools of reason or of scientific methodology I can apply them to certain phenomena that I identify and then I can analyze them and so we can't we can't measure both with the same the same scope if we try then we fail it's like it's like uh it's as if I'm trying to tell you on the one hand to to uh put on a scale you know the the the formula for I don't know for certain you know certain speeds or certain uh certain phenomena and at the same time I'm trying to help you understand why you love your wife and then you say well how do you how can you prove that you love your wife like how and then and so we this is the problem and so it doesn't mean that love is a completely subjective idiosyncratic thing it's just that the the the the forms by which we in which we approach the world are a different type than the phenomena that we analyze and that we quantify and so they they they require different tools different intuitions and those intuitions do not have to satisfy the re requirement of someone who wants to know how to make you know uh like gunpowder and what the chemical formula is they're just not the same thing I don't know if that makes sense no it does but the formula for gunpowder works or doesn't work yeah how do we know if the formula for hierarchy works or doesn't work like like like there got be some way to verify whether or not you're right or wrong let me let's let's let's use another example when it's simpler let's say how do you know like let's say advertising works right trying to convince people of something uh using certain methods can function okay but it doesn't function 100% of the time doesn't function with every single person it's not the same type of criteria and so you know that there is a hierarchy of goods now the idea that people won't completely agree of how that hierarchy lays itself out that is inevitable but to deny that that's part of the mechanisms by which we judge the world that is also a problem because what happens when people do that and you see that in the case especially of the new atheist types is that they do have a hierarchy by which they ENT they entertain the world they do have a hierarchy of Virtues and values they take it for granted they don't analyze it they don't identify it they judge the world with it uh and then they act as if it's just the it's just the water in which they're swimming and they can pretend that they're just being scientists and and reasonable I'll give you an example that's very simple that I that I noticed once it was a discussion between Sam Harris and uh and Dawkins where they were talking about a very controversial subject which is race and IQ and you know they were talking about the studies that discussed this and then Dawkin said I don't care about that subject I don't think it's important to talk about that and I thought like okay Mr Dawkins by what criteria do you decide that that's not high on your hierarchy of values of things to study and I would like for us to explore that because as soon as you start to explore that then you're in another sphere you're not in the same sphere as the the kind of rationalist scientist types think that they always inhabit and so the the difference of care is is is part of that like what is it that we care about and how that lays itself out MH and so the the answer is not a simple one the answer is not like you know if you follow this formula then this is how it's going to it's going to play out H it's it's more subtle because it it has the problem of being the it has the problem of looking at the mechanism by which we how let's do it this way yeah it has the problem of Consciousness looking at itself right it has the problem of intelligence looking at itself and that is that is the you could say it's the problem of human knowledge and the problem of human civilization it's the problem that's encoded in every single mythology every single you know worldview that that that has laid itself out since the beginning of time it's a very it's a difficult problem it's the problem that's happening in the Garden of Eden right it's the problem these are the problems that we're dealing with they are very difficult because they talk about the the question of how to look at the frame by which I'm looking at the world and so that's not easy so it means that you know what what the let's say the Saints would say and what you know some of the philosophers would say is that that or even like I don't know a Zen Buddhist would say is that you can arrive at those things by a type of intuition Insight right you can arrive at insight and that Insight is not contained in the mechanisms that I'm trying to to to bring about it's contained in in the in the type of grasping that happens right when you see that things come together and all of a sudden you see a kind of Shining Light of of a of unity and you grasp it that's inside yeah but inside cannot be uh can very difficultly be explained by type of discourse that rationalists want to use okay I just spoke so you have so we have a problem which is that which is that on the one hand this is what all the traditional things are talking about right this is what so many of the religious uh let's say the theologians the mystics are talking about which is the capacity for insight but you can't totally describe it you have to play around it you have to skirt around it you have to point at it and then when you have that ex so you could say the same like you could let's let's use an example that's very simple it's not there's no woo woo here you know it's it's like I can tell you what it's like to to be in love I can say it I can give you tell you A Million Ways and what it what it's like to be in love but unless you that happens to you unless you grasp that unless you reach that Insight you will never you will never fully understand what it is you have to you have to enter into it with experience now the the wayes we talk about it can help guide you in that Insight can help stabilize that Insight can help you but it's not not enough you have to have you have to kind of enter into that experience and it's this actually this is the same for everything that you describe this is the same for anything that has identity you know I can describe a hammer all day long but the grabbing the hammer in your hand and using it that's that's the Insight of the hammer and it's not it cannot be reduced to its to its quantifiable things can be reduced to its description can be reduced even to its function there's something about it which is more and that is that is the very mysticism that like that that that someone like Lindsay wants to decry but you can't avoid that because mysticism happens not just in someone in some Saint's cave where they're praying and they're having a it happens every time you encounter unity in the world every time you transcend the multiplicity of of of uh quantifiable things into to the unity that binds them together you're having a little mystical experience yeah that is true for it's as true for a pencil as it's true for falling in love or going to church all these or or or you know putting your hand on your on your breast and and saying the Pledge of Allegiance like these these things are all mystical in their nature yeah but the issue then is that when we observe um human beings unifying in their unification in a bigger group like once they start to formulate or to congregate through religions through uh Creeds through political parties Nations businesses uh about friendships um well friendships is still like families and friendships is still more organic but once we get into a higher level like a something Beyond a Township there's the capacity for authoritarian ISM totalitarianism unification a unification the same in a person a person can have an authoritarian a person can try to apply authoritarian principles to the multiple aspects that constitute it right do that all the time right they they deny something about themselves right they they just try to push it into the as if it doesn't exist and they try to compress right this idea of uh repressing certain things in you that's an authoritarian approach to a single being yeah and so the authoritarian approach can happen at every level of unity from the person to the family to the city to the state to the to the basketball team to any type of unity can is in danger of having that characteristic there's no there's no way around it and so When approaching any given group of people how does one Analyze That to see if it's healthy or unhealthy or good or bad or evil or or whatever like like what what tool set how do you describe that which allows you to assess whether this Unity is proper or improper well the unity itself I mean how can I say this unities are always around a purpose right so you the first of all the purpose can be bad right you can have a street gang who's who the fact of their Unity is to rob people and kill people and so the purpose of the unity that's what Unity is always d you directed towards purpose and so you can you can first of all identify the the reason for the unity and that can be a problem and then you can also look at the mechanisms by which the unity is manifesting itself which is that the you know the uh the traditional Vision I think of unity is something like a dance between unity and multiplicity right it's it's this kind of breathing in and breathing out uh is it one of my favorite quotes from roomy who talked talks about you know he says yeah you know if you if you keep your hand always open or if you keep your hand always closed you will be paralyzed but you know actual experience is in the very subtle moving o open and closed of the hand that's how reality works is this this subtle dance between unity and multiplicity uh and that's how you can recognize if something is balanced or not and and it's so it's the same in a family you can see that right it's like if there's too much multiplicity then it's chaos in the house and then you know everybody's doing their own thing and things are messy and nobody can and everybody's screaming at each other uh and if there's too much Unity right then then everybody is afraid and everybody is just in line and just doing the things they need to do and there's no variability there's no joy there's no kind of uh and so you have to always no matter what Unity you participate in you always have to find a balance between the two and that's true of yourself by the way as well if you work 24 hours a day you will collapse if you play 24 hours a day you will collapse and if you sleep 24 hours a day you will collapse like there is a balance of attention and distraction there's a there's a balance of reason and emotion all of these things are part of how the human being functions uh and If you deny one aspect of it then it builds up and it explodes and by the way this is my critique of of the kind of rationalist Enlightenment mode is that it ignores aspect of reality it just says just says don't do that don't be unreasonable you know don't follow your emotions just be just be reasonable and logical and and uh and scientific and you'll be fine right and that's the equivalent of saying you know you could work 20 24 hours a day if you just don't sleep Benjamin you know just don't sleep and if you sleep I'll tell you oh I told you not to sleep why are you sleeping if you become distracted I'll say well why are you being distracted Benjamin I told you just pay attention I it seems like you're not following what I'm saying if you just did what I said then the world would be perfect and everything would flow like like you know would flow wonderfully and so this is the problem with the this is the problem with the Stephen Pinker and kind of you know Hicks and all of these these kind of Enlightenment types is that they they decry an aspect of humanity which is part of humanity and is not only part but is inevitable to humanity and then they're surprised when they watch it blow up they're surprised when they see it explode in front of them and they're like well no we said just be reasonable and uh you know just follow these these things and if you do then you'll be fine and this is where we are now by the way this is the moment where we've reached which is that the things that the enlightenment ignored which is for example the means by which we attain Unity that's now exploding in everybody's face they said just be reasonable be rational if we're just rational and scientific and we we develop scientific things and more machines and more and more uh you know and more technology and more science then we'll all be we'll be we'll have food and and wealth and money and then we'll be happy right but sadly that's not what's happening that's obviously not what's happening and now that narrative is exploding and it's exploding in the very mechanisms but that gave birth to it which is that now we have we have people at open AI doing rituals and invoking who knows what you know into their into their AI God and everybody's surprised as if this is as if this was not something that has been building up since after World War II basically well I mean I guess we are in the shadow of World War Two where let's just say um various different powers and principalities organized in various different ways uh we have uh Japan we have Germany Germany became uh or Italy became fascist Germany became National Socialist and they began to purge their population to create some sort of very incredibly sharp like un intention like one very sharp unity and since then you know America and the Allies come and like they break apart the unity or the unity breaks itself apart or it causes a reaction in other parts of the multiplicity of humanity to to kind of counter um but in the north Americas at least we're we're very wary of unity again we we see um I guess this guy Rob Riner who's like this bleeding heart liberal on Twitter uh always decrying the far right he never talks about the right he always talks about the extreme right the far only the far right there there's only the extreme right and uh you know he's he I think he's producing a documentary about Christian nationalism um but his entire mode is Christian nationalist it's just progress it's just a version of Christianity that purged religious talk out of it but just transferred all these religious Concepts onto the Notions of humanity and progress um but it's it's the same like that's the real Christian nationalism is woke it's the one that's infected every part of our uh governing apparatus that's Christian nationalism is just Downstream from an older version of itself but I so I have like I have sympathy for for by the way for James's position which he says like is preparing a big scop I totally agree with him I agree with him that of what he's scared of which is that the the farle or the the the kind of activist left will use the the Resurgence of the relationship between Christianity and nationalism to attack the nation itself and to attack the idea of the nation and of the and of the you know your Constitution or whatever by the way I'm not American I always have to remind people of that your Constitution and all these things like I I completely agree with him but I think that I think that the mechanisms by which he is approaching that are going to be counterproductive for his whatever his cause is you know because how can I say this it's like let's ask this question uh for America why is America a nation because we are a nation at this point that's right go just take it for granted there we're just a we're just a bunch of people in a land you know and uh that's it that's it and so that so this is the problem that we're that we're coming towards is that if we've haven't asked ourselves wouldn't make something one for a few hundred years actually we have you're right so there it's there's Extremes in the enlightenment world right the enlightenment world the the world after the enlightenment I tried to describe it in as two extremes that are are getting further from each other so if you want to say Enlightenment and counter Enlightenment whatever that's fine just as long as you understand that they're both caused by the same thing that they're both causing each other right if you want to use the word counter Enlightenment I I don't like it because it makes it feel too simplistic but you have in so on the one hand you have an increase in let's say uh you could you could call it like lower identities right and then you also have the opposite which is is the desire to kind of break them down and so you have nationalisms that become strong right the the nation state is a is a post-enlightenment phenomena it's not an ancient phenomena the way that we understand Nations and borders and governments and states and and bureaucracies these are not the the ancient ways of thinking these are post Enlightenment uh structures and so you have the nation which grows and then you have something like the anti- nation or or globalism or communism or revolutionary like there there's a tendency to want to dis to deconstruct that which is being set up as being stronger and stronger and so this is still playing out now like that the the same things that led to World War II you know are still playing out today because we haven't dealt with any of it we haven't looked at the root cause of of the problems we've brought about both the nationalism and the communism in in the early 20th century and so now we have the same problem happening in different guises and once again Lindsay is absolutely right to see the insane postmodernism as a continuation of the Revolutionary and communist uh things that burgeoned up in the in the 19th and early 20th century but these things are G are H are are going to happen and and let's say the nationalism the C the centralism is going to keep peing too at the same time and so the globalist tendency towards C centralism and the weird things we saw happened during covid They're all playing out the same patterns of a separation of unity and multiplicity so it's like people emphasizing too much unity and then people emphasizing too much multiplicity Happ happening simultaneously so we see kind of global structures of power manifesting themselves and deconstructing uh Powers happening at the same time you know I you know we wrote uh Jordan Peterson and I wrote a an essay for Ark recently on this problem you know which is trying to articulate subsidiarity as the right relationship between unity and multiplicity all across different levels right the idea what do you mean by subsidiarity subsidiarity it is the idea that there is this tendency to move towards Unity let's say to a unified State the the ultimate image of this is something like the state and the people right so we have people that are just they just spread out on a on a board right they they have no connection between each other they're just all atomized individuals and then on top of that you have a state which is becoming more and more powerful and more and more controlling and those two Tendencies play on each other that is the the anarchic tendency of the modern world the tendency to deconstruct into atomize individuals feeds the tyan tyrannical system because as we atomize because as we atomize and as we're not no longer connected in little groups like families like like clubs you know like parishes all of these things those those uh functions have to be covered by something and so charity can't if I'm not like taking care of my parents when they're old then the state has to provide for that right the state has to create old people's homes with like you know with with with Taxation and funding or whatever and so as you as you disconnect from down here you're you're demanding even even if you're even if you're revolutionary in your attitude if you're saying if you even if you're a hippie and you're like yeah screw the system break this down you know you know you have to liberate yourself from family from religion from all these things and all be a bunch of anarchist uh you know living living all apart from each other that's calling the system to to become more and more powerful so those are the two like Tendencies you could say of the words world since the Enlightenment and you can see it right from the outset with lock and Hobs you know Hobs is an authoritarian for reason because he understands that reason is centralized thing that comes down and he's like we're going to impose this reason and these principles on the people that are that are going and that end up becoming more and more atomized as time goes forward so what we're trying to articulate is that the the the principle of subsidiarity which is the idea that you are you are made of Multiplicity yourself right you already have multiple subpersonalities inside you and that and then you have to unite them in a person and that person has to be United in a family and those families have to be united into neighborhoods into into cities into all all kinds of parallel structures like clubs like you know like I don't know the Boy Scouts or and the church and the sports teams and all of these things and this is actually how how reality scaffolds itself how it kind of builds both unity and resilience at the same time now the the the problem we've got now is you've got these two things like there's no by the way there's very little difference between the libertarian anarcho libertarian types and the Rainbow Coalition types they're basically saying the same thing they're saying I can self-define myself completely I can just be me and I can completely be independent and and I don't need anything you know above me which is which is kind of uh exercising authority over me and that's and that when you do that it calls for it calls for tyranny and that's what that's why why that's what happened in so many of the revolutions is that Revolution is followed by tyranny because Anarchy calls for authority authority the problem that James brings up is that like there's on a certain level like um the right the dissonant right the counter Enlightenment that they they want to impose some sort of structure right a religious person wants to impose their religious structure on the world and is saying you can't tell me what to do you're not God no one person is God so how does humankind because if you look at liberalism it's nice that you get to be an orthodox person I get to do my uh my spiritual practice you know and my parents can be Christian you know and and we can coexist and kind of have a different framework or a different practice but still somehow come together and the the the liberal project of allowing these uh this multiplicity of religious belief a multiplicity of like higher level uh Transcendent orders um is kind of nice it's nice to have Muslims getting along with Christians getting along with Jews and then not demanding one you know one structure or who demands that and and if if what you're saying is that it's unstable on some level to allow for multiplicity on some level or we Unity is going to happen Unity is inevitable like how does one navigate in a post uh post-religious or post- unified religious world all these different you know how it happens and you know how we navigate we end up with the with the the the WF and the and the and the wh and the UN and that's what we end up with right it's it's funny that it's like oh I don't want any type of moral order over me as as you're saying that and as the entire world since the 1960s hippies have been saying that you could you watch these structures become more and more powerful and become more and more encompassing and Technology making it possible and so it's like can I say this it's this is not like I'm not an idealist I I I hope you understand this like I'm not I'm not saying we're going to reach some perfect Utopia and that we're going to find the solution to everything okay uh but what I can see is that there is in this process of moving towards multiplicity and towards more and more Unity right now the nation state is in danger because there is no justification for the nation state there's no like basic philosophical justification for its existence on its own unless we have what I believe to be this kind of subsidiary subsidiary notion that we kind of participate in identities all the way through and so I agree that the problem of you know a kind of let's say Islamic approach to Christianity you know a kind of uh idea that right now we could impose you know I don't know like some kind of Christian hierarchy over the West I think that's a ridiculous idea and I've never advocated for that once in my entire why is that ridiculous well because I don't know do you think that's possible I don't think it's possible but so it's a ridiculous idea deposit an idea that's not possible is wasting your time and wasting your energy and is not like what are you try what do you think is gonna happen like for anybody that I don't I don't think I've ever met anybody who thinks that by the way but if there are people who think that the only way to do that would be through massive violence like on the OWN on your own people is that what you would do to impose well no you're right I think it is happening it's just called progressivism and it's what like that is Christian nationalism that is just Christianity without uh without the cross in some way without sacrifice it's really it's interesting phenomen it's EXA it's taken a lot of like the morality of Christianity and then like try to liberate it from like this kind of crusty way of thinking that's traditional and symbolic and it's tried to impose it on bureaucratic levels you know with like these flags and these rambos you can see it producing symbolism that keeps on getting really icky and yucky you know but it's cuz it there's no order in it but it is trying to order the world and it is trying to take over you you have to in order to be uh you know increasingly in order to get ahead in Academia you have to believe in this way of thinking this Dei stuff and diversity equity and inclusion they're all kind of uh adapted Christian values of of unity it's a religious thing for sure yeah it's definitely religious but this is what this is again like if to come back to the the the statement that started this whole argument for example with me and James is that this is happening right it's like the world is is becoming religious again I don't think it ever totally stopped being religious but it's happening at a very fast speed and the image of that religiosity right now is exactly that it's like trans is sacred that's the image of the religiosity it's like it's like I am you know you saw that speech in the in the Joon of Arc uh play that got put online for like a week and then scrubbed from the internet as if it never existed where it was basically saying you know I transcend mo i transcend uh uh categories you know I am Transcendent because I am not one thing I'm like the Trinity I am you know transcended in every way and it's like that's what we're heading towards you know uh and so the the the problem is that we do need unity in order to function and what's happening now is is we're being provided with a a sacred Narrative of unity which is actually a kind of uh Paradox of Multiplicity right it's saying something like multiplicity is our Unity right it's multiplicity is the only that that that you know diversity is our strength as said our friend Justin Trudeau uh but that's what that aesthetic is it's basically it's like reducing us all to the most idiosyncratic thing that we can find and making that into a kind of transcendent good that is to be worshiped uh but that that uh that that leads to more that just leads to tyranny it just leads to more tyranny that's why the Glo that's why like people are confused by the way like like what's the relationship between globalism and like LGBT activism you think like how rid because LGBT activism is like is excessive and it has a kind of Aesthetics of of of Carnival and Jubilation and and uh you know in excess and all that and how does that fit with like environmentalism and covid mandates and all of this kind of tyrannical thing and the answer is it does perfectly if you understand how these two opposites basically feed each other how one gives birth to the other how the the the controlling State wants as much idiosyncrasy as possible and the the the development of idiosyncrasy calls for centralization but what's the moderate answer to that like what's the what's the alternative to that I think the alternative is really a subsidiary vision of reality it really is this idea that we are all made of multip mcity multiplicity is part of unity right it's that which constitute Unity everything has a center and a margin everything has an identity and things that don't totally fit and so we we both aim towards the center and have compassion for the margin right this is the Christian message is to say like basically say I I I see the ideal and I aim towards the ideal but I reach out in love to those that that don't fit that ideal I you know I give that I give them a hand and in compassion and love without compromising the ideal and so I say I say things like I say I say very hard things like you know the the purpose of sexuality is to have children and sexuality should be lived in a monogamous you know marriage without divorce that's the ideal and then I look at myself then I look at everybody around me and I realize nobody reaches that ideal nobody nobody lives that perfect L everybody failed everybody's broken everybody is a part of that ideal but I don't compromise the ideal for the fact that we don't fit we I rather use love and compassion uh you know to the people around me so to me that's the only way to go is that's the only solution for the problem of identity is that we it's like it's neither tyrannical identity that eliminates all all the uh all the margin which is what you saw in the Nazis for example and and in kind of extreme nationalism right nor is it just pure idiosyncrasy and anything goes and and everything is equal and and all values are equivalent like those two things are not are not possible and and and I don't say that as I'm not even talking about a political system like everything I talk I never talk about political systems well that's that's the danger though because it's going to translate into politics somehow like Ark if ark's going to do anything it's going to have a political impact so it's going to propose some sort of unity it's going to propose some sort of alternative like you say there's all these different identities it's going to have to claim that there's a global a proper Global identity it's going to have to claim that there's a proper use for something like the UN the WF some sort of Masters of the Universe experts you know who who are in control of power arc Arc one of the fing founding principles of Arc is no compulsion like that has been from the very beginning from Jordan Peterson and you know there are certain reasons why I participated in Arc you know I have my doubts about Arc as much as anybody because I don't want it also to become a kind of right-wing WF which is possible like that could happen until up to now I don't see that happening it cannot happen if something if something's going to propose to start to Define things on that level it's going to have to emulate that definition so when you get the definition we propose is sub it what if that's a definition we propos yeah okay so fine you're saying that you're proposing that there's levels to the universe you're still going to have to do the eye of the pyramid what is at the top of that pyramid and then what's next to the top to be God okay and then what's right under God like the pope or the the fathers the church fathers right well I would say the the I mean of course as a Christian I would say the Saints you know uh and the testimony of the of the Saints not not the human authorities that are alive today and have power well yeah but eventually you're going to get to the people so you're you're you're proposing all these things that are but like there's eventually there's a line eventually there's the Masters of the Universe like the highest human people who are alive like and what does that system look like so the system a subsidiary the way a subsidiary system looks like is one which many people can understand which is that higher levels of authority do not mean that they have power over direct power over lower parts of the per pyramid you could say and so for example you we have that in our everyday World which is the president of the United States cannot tell the mayor of Chicago what to do okay right because the mayor of Chicago has its own has his own principality yeah and what do you mean what why are because uh yeah directly no indirectly absolutely Federal funding like the system itself incentivizes or disincentivizes certain sorts of uh behaviors through funding that's why we have issues with the civil rights law right now because it's being used to enforce uh extra like like it's it's being used to sculpt culture and to tell people what to do that is not in the actual documents of the Constitution right like the government's not supposed to tell you how to associate what to think but through civil rights law it now has the power to influence that and then it has the power to uh tell schools what to do that's why we have you know like with with the Obama Administration you just have you watch this thing with the gender issue it's self like going into schools and and and pushing a certain ideology through the schools so no uh Biden can't tell uh Nome what to do but the whole system itself tells itself what to do okay so there is a there is a unbalanced move towards centralism let's say that has happened over time in in the modern State that's the modern State itself seems to lend itself to that to that problem which is like to kind of move towards towards centralism uh but it doesn't take away the basic idea let's say so the problem is that what I'm calling for people to do is to participate in that kind of subsidiarity from the bottom up right is to understand that you are a person that you are part of a family and that family can participate in communities that you can be engaged in your local uh surroundings in your church in your sports teams or whatever and to see that as being being absolutely real and the and the foundation on which your experience of reality functions and the scaffolding on which reality is built and I I don't see any other way except from a bottom up way of I don't I don't there's no other way because like you said the only the only way that you would do it differently would be to create an alternative tyranny to the to the to the Tyranny that's there at this moment which is why just like just like Jordan Peterson I agree with him when he said clean your room like not in obviously it seems PR when you say that but it's like the only thing you can really do is be the best friend the best father the best you know the best connected uh part of this scaffolding of reality and that will have ripples right it will transform things because the system that we're in this kind of move towards over centralization and more and more centralization and the move towards more and more insane levels of idiosyncrasy and kind of self-naming and and self-creating it cannot sustained for a long time there's just no way it can't hold and so you know like I'm not a I don't want to be Doom and Gloom but I think that out of the ashes of whatever is coming will be those that had that had a strong Network around them that have friends and family and that have and that are part that are connected locally that's what going to rise out of this because because I I agree and that's why if if Arc ever tries to be something um akin to the WF or the UN or some kind of legislating body or some some type of institution that tries to directly influence uh laws in different countries then you can you'll watch me run out of that with that 100 miles an hour but with the people that are there now I don't think that's going to end danger of happening anytime soon obviously any any structure can be captured that's obvious we've saw that we've seen that happen you know you saw that happen uh Over Our Generations but um I don't yeah at least for now I don't see that as part of the people that I've met there so we've been talking like this really abstract sociological level I I kind of want to like invert the question because in my conversation with James eventually we have to get to Define what an individual is like if if you know that's like the building block uh for at least he brought that up like that nobody's really defined individual like what is the individual and I was asking him and he's like uh so he's working on that it's like so what is an individual because that's a very important piece of the puzzle um because if you want to preserve individual rights then you have to Define an individual against a collective or in a collective uh and you're saying that there's all this subsidary multiplicity identity indiv uality multiple Unity individuality Unity over and over and over this is the problem of even phrasing it as individual and Collective like to me that's already a problem like it to to just understand someone as an individual facing a collective is the beginning of what we're seeing now it's the beginning of the individual becoming more atomized and the collective being more and more let's say encompassing so that you end up with these weird systems that we're in now that is not so I would say that even like for example like in Christian theology we we use the word person it's a much better I think a better word than the word individual which is that the person is already in relationship with others right the idea that you are that you can completely completely isolate an individual from everybody else is very difficult now I understand why you have to do that to some extent in the law that is that that seems necessary um to avoid certain problems but I don't I think it's dangerous to do it fundamentally philosophically to kind of isolate the individual but you could see that you could just say that a person is a locust of Consciousness like that I don't I don't think that that's is that that weird of a of a way to to to to understand that well I mean you're you're you're answering the qu let me just ask the question so it can be on record what is a person what is a man what is a human a yeah a human and so I would say that I think that's what the that's what I would say I would say you know a person is a locust of Consciousness and that is you know in the image of God in the sense that it is not completely isolated lcus of Consciousness right it's a it's a lcus of Consciousness that reflects a higher Consciousness or higher consciousnesses however you want to say that uh and then that that engages with other persons that engages with other faces other people facing them and and form bonds and communities and also to some extent exist with and in each other like we don't we don't exist completely uh alone from each other we we we exist with and and in each other and to me that's the and so the the ultimate image of a person isn't is a person in the communion of love it's not a person on their own you know I don't know standing on the corner with a with a sign asking for their rights not that we shouldn't have rights of people but that the ultimate image of a person is a person in a communion of love that's that's what a person is okay what is this love thing that you're talking about this love thing yeah it's the thing that binds you it's that love is that which binds binds how how would you how would you teach a 10-year-old old boy to to to move towards proper love and move away from improper love cuz there's improper ways of binding of course yeah and so that like the entire you could say that the entire uh history of of Christian theology is about understanding proper love you could say and you know actually you know it's interesting Dante is probably one of the best ones if you want to look at how to deal with proper love Dante has a great ntis comedy is one of the best examinations of that um which is that care right we could use the word care the word care is is is is is better because it today with haiger people kind of understand it a little more right it's like care is that which makes you move right you don't do anything without care right if I go from here to the door is because I have a reason to if I right if I eat an apple it's because I have have a reason to it's like there's care that is motivating me towards you could say the rest from that care right if I'm hungry I eat and I hope to find rest from my desire in that in that in that movement and that is what motivates all our action right so you could say that the world is built in care built by care um and so there are hierarchies of care there are things that make us live more than others and if we if we get that wrong then obviously we we're in trouble right and so you could say something like food is good and we should care for it but there's a limit to which we should care for food it should be anchored in something that we care for more okay because if we just if we care for food as the ultimate thing that we love then you know we'll become unhealthy and fat and whatever and that's true of all the things that we care about you know you can become you can become possessed by anything if you care for it too much you know whether it's money whether it's sex whether it's I don't know it's like success or Prestige or whatever it is like and all of those things are good all of them but they're just good at the level that they should and that's why we we you know in the the idea of Christian the Christian theology rep you know structures the world that way and so the love of others you know is more important first of all than let's say the love of things like that's the that's a beginning it's like if I care for others then I get more life than if I care for my car like if I if I love my my wife and my kids then I get more and I have more uh there's more reality in my life than if I if I love my car and my car is fine I can love my car to some extent it just has to right has properly organized and that but that SC SC also and you can understand that the love of Virtues for example and if I if I understand that certain virtues also provide life to me truth beauty um you know and that if I love goodness right that's the I'm almost like a neoplatonist now like if I love the good itself then I am aiming towards the highest the highest and I'm kind of moving up the the the this hierarchy of love you could say um so does that make sense in in in terms of understanding what love is um it was a trick question but uh asking me what love is a trick question I mean what did I not see in your trick I mean can you really answer that question can one really answer what love is I don't know that's the it's a tricky question let me put it that way but um when when you get to something like uh making meaning of things on a collective level like through religion on the level of religion or on the level of absence of religion or the the uh I guess the uh it's not really an absence I guess that's your point that's my point it's like well it's still there it's just like it looks like it's not there you know it's just the the there is no absence of religion that's an that's if there's any illusion that's the illusion why is that an illusion because we we need things to bind us together and those things that bind us together they are purposes and their orders right there's a purpose and an order to a Binding Together right there's a reason why there's a purpose for this pencil and there's an order to it there's a pattern by which I recognize it's being so there's a there's a purpose and in order that's true for everything that we care about as humans yeah and then it's especially true of the things we care about as humans amongst each other yeah which is that a family meal is has purpose and order a family meal is a ritual is a ritual offered to the unity of our family and it has to have a certain form it's not it there's variability in the form it's not like every family meal is exactly the same but there's a limit to that variability right because if I come to the family meal drunk then I'm going to break the family meal right if I stand on the table or if I lay on the floor during the family meal then I'm going to break the order of that meal which is aimed towards its purpose that that uh that's a little religious ceremony family meal is a little religious ceremony and then a game a sports game is a little religious ceremony we come together together with a purpose there's an order there's a celebration there's all these things that we're doing together we we we wear uniforms and we wear funny hats all the things that people make fun of for religion is there in a basketball game or in a in a baseball game and so it is the means by which we bind together now what people now call explicitly religious is when we gum together and we unify under a Transcendent good which we unify under into something which is uh beyond our particularities in every in every way right that's what that is but if you so if you take a take a a village like in Quebec it's it's quite nice like because we we in Quebec used to be very Catholic I'm not Catholic by the way so every village had a church right and the church is the place where we would go and we would celebrate births uh weddings baptisms funerals all the things that help us recognize that we care for each other were celebrated at the church in light of something which transcends all of us and which binds us all together all of humanity is bound together under this this canopy that we're now celebrating the things that bind us together in that space now if you take the church out you're like well we don't need this thing just get rid of it and all now we just need we just we just we'll just be together with reason we'll be reasonable and we'll we'll have reasonable reason together uh and and then you're surprised that that like two generations later people aren't getting married right people have no initiations at all for their children you don't know your neighbor you don't care for your neighbor you live in a suburb now and there's no downtown and there's no place to even walk at as a as a together as a community you have malls you have houses and you just are scattered on a board like uh you know like a bunch of dots and then you're like well how did this happen what happened and it's like that's exactly what happened is that you try you thought that you didn't need something to bind you together at a higher level and then that Unity breaks down yeah at every level after that it's but pointing out the problem invites the answer the solution so like how do you go from Suburbia back to Village Life you can't like how do you put the church back in I mean you have these mega churches America comes up with these different ways of doing that like with you know like Prosperity gospels different things that serve that function sporting events stuff like that uh the woke stuff like is the is kind of playing with the same thing and your role is somebody who whether or not you you you want to admit you're prizz a certain religious framework um and then you're you're uh you're not imposing but superimposing it by by taking bits of culture and explaining it like you explain like these little phenomena like okay well here and you're you're describing a pattern and you're very good at describing the pattern without imposing like your framework on it but you do have a framework that you live within you're icon Carver you believe in the Transcendent Christ God Saints all that stuff it sounds like you it could be the case I don't mean this as an accusation but it's like you're kind of playing both sides you're like well I don't I don't want to impose my order but somebody's got to impose the order some the the order is going to be imposed and my order is better than other orders but maybe you don't want to say that so you you you talk about in terms of Virtues you talk you I talk about it in terms of I talk about it in terms of groundup participation that's how I talk up okay not like go to church I say I say go to go to church be deliberate about the communities that you have be deliberate about your family be deliberate about the people around you be deliberate about uh you know the the ways in which you can participate and that will in the end be the only Bull workk against what's coming and so I really don't see uh I really don't see so your humility or like your uh you're stopping from imposing your order on other people it is not uh because uh it's not false humility uh it's not it's not like a trick it's you're saying you have to find that for yourself but you're going to have to find it so find it deliberately this is what I've found but you have to go forth and find it so you're not really prizing it apparently orthod believe no but I do believe that Christianity I do believe Christianity is the is the best story the way the truth in the life don't hide that at all but I I also don't see how that if that's the best story I really don't see how imposing it on people is going to be useful uh you know if it's I'm trying to show the beauty of that story and the the power of that story so that people you know want to participate but I don't see the I mean I the idea of imposing it top Town yeah you know in this world is is a ridiculous to me is just a would be a ridiculous proposition yeah and are there really people who think that like honestly you met anybody who who says we should have uh we should impose Christianity top down in the United States like as does have you ever met one person who says that uh you can construe certain people's um fantasy like that's what I think it is I don't think that there are I don't think that there are people who who who say that I there is a worry maybe it's a maybe it's a St I'm trying to steal me on the strum I'm trying to say to what extent can you avoid tyranny to what extent and and I'm just trying to flesh out your attitude of and and you said it you you indicated it or hinted at it and that you said this is the best story why would I impose the best story it's just the best story I'll just tell the story and it'll prove itself it's the same thing with 2 + 2al 4 which is something I kind of like flippantly brought up with James when we were talking about symbolism like 2 plus 2al 4 is some sort of symbolic order um and and he's and I'm like don't isn't that like isn't that like authoritarian like don't you impose that on the world he's like no it's truth you just say it is truth if you if you stray from the truth you won't get anywhere so it's just like 2 plus 2 equals 4 is the best story Christianity isn't necessarily 2 plus 2 equals 4 that's the weird thing about it and that's when you talk you kind of have to I I have to immerse myself in in your way of thinking cuz you're not really telling me this this methodology but you're always kind of using this methodology you're picking up symbols you're you're telling the story you kind of have a map about hierarchy and subsidiarity and unity and multiplicity you have key words that you're doing it and then when we drill down into your story you can talk about like the actual um we could probably go into like any given verse of the Bible any given passage of the Bible and you could start to play with that and I could see in your relationship to that sacred text of yours the truth of it but it's not like it's not going to be coded in in the same way that 2 plus 2 equals 4 is going to be so I'm just trying to say if people are worried about Christian nationalism if people are worried that you are fomenting some sort of tyranny like I'm I'm try any of my content how could anybody watch any of my content think that I'm fomenting a kind of tyranny I don't think that's possible well because people are scared that in the post if you're not for liberalism if you're saying that that liberalism is insufficient that therefore you're trying to impose some sort of unity like but it sounds like you're saying Unity is going to happen and there's better and worse forms of unity so I would rather each individual work on their own unities from the bottom up work on themselves work on their family and then that's the only way we can have order that's sustainable and that's good for all is that if it comes from ordered people it comes more I I totally think that that's true you know the the pillar you could say you know the pillars of the church are the Saints that's how we understand it in in the Orthodox tradition which is that that's a symbolic way of what do you mean the pillars of the church are the same like that's the this your total poetry like what does that mean the pillars of the chur I mean is that it is through the it is through the personal transformation of people that the world is transformed it is not it is not first in for and and and firstly through political action through political activism through all these things that true transformation happens through you becoming a saint if you become a saint then then you will transform reality if you if you create I'm not against being politically active but if you think that that's how you're going to fundamentally change reality then forget it it's like let's take the United States for example like it the culture war is the most ridiculous thing in the universe and when you look at it just just from just one step you know away from each other it's like you you literally have a country that split 5050 down the middle and then everybody's fighting for like the few percentages to win the next election and so who is winning would you think is anybody going to win how are you going to win are you going to destroy 50% of the country are you going to just eliminate everybody like there's no this idea that this kind of culture War stuff is that's why I tried to avoid it as much as I can I obviously I get dragged in once in a while but I Tred to avoid that kind of stuff as much as I can because you know how are you going to the problem the problem of the fragmentation is such a deep problem that it doesn't have a political solution you know that the anyways that's that is that is how I that's why I don't advocate for political Solutions because you're not going to conquer 50% of your country with a with what with an election like what what difference does it make it and and people like even now like even when I see you know I'm a Christian for example I'm a Christian I am against uh like I'm against abortion it's a moral thing I'm against all the things that Christians are against but but people rejoicing because they overturn some law in the United States and thinking that now they're the tide has changed like they're winning the culture War it's just the most ridiculous ridiculous thing ever this is ridiculous like you have half the population against you and you think that you've overturned the law and now like this is it like we're gonna we're we've got it we're moving towards Victory the the problem is so deep that I do believe that the only thing that can solve it is Saints in the sense of transformed people transformed families transformed communities that will be like beacons for a world that is that is is lost in despair so if you can be someone that other people want to imitate that is a much better thing to be than winning getting some law passed and and thinking that now you you finally got like the right amount of people on the Supreme Court so now now we can do the thing it's like the these these Solutions are are are heading towards Civil War is what they're heading towards yeah and I and I I don't know I'm not saying like you should just do nothing and sit around and wait for the other side to take you over if you're on one side of that cultural divide but that you're not going to find a solution there it's not going to there's no long-term solution in this kind of political fight well where does where does sainthood start where does this transformed person start to transform where have you seen it like in in your own life or in the lives of others where you start to see that change happening yeah you have to start you have to look at your sins right instead of just looking at the sins of others you have to see your own sins right see the places where you fall short of the ideal see the places where you lie the places where you where you where you twist reality to fit your narrative where instead of just looking at how the others do it right try start by doing it on your own on yourself I mean don't be naive right don't be an idiot and just and and ignore when let's say things are being Twisted by your enemy but you have to start with yourself and and that is I think the solution ultimately and so whether it's politically whether it's personally you know whether it's in your personal relationships whether it is in your own bad habits whether it is all these things that's the beginning right to not be a hypocrite to not you know and we're all Hypocrites we we we all have to work on that but I think that that's the that's the place to start right it really is I mean that's what you know it's like that's what that's what Jesus said that's what the Saints always say the Saints always say that say transform yourself you know forgive your for forgive people right and so we are looking at a world where forgiveness has become impossible we see that on the political sphere we see that in the world around us so what's the solution the solution is forgive people that's a solution it's not complain because because forgiveness is impossible the solution is forgive forgive others that's the solution forgive your enemies like that's a rough one it's a tough one but that's the way to go I don't see another solution what helps you in the project of being a forgiving person well I I would say the same I would say that that that the the testimony of the Holy ones like the testimony of the saints that helps me uh you know going conf that's do you have one particular Saint that's been with you uh I guess recently over the last few years or throughout your life well I I you know I don't know if you I mean you know published this this graphic novel called God's dog right yeah and so that's about St Christopher who is a who is a monster right St Christopher is a doghe headed man or a giant you know and I think St Christopher has been very close to me because as someone who's more conservative right that I'm more of a Christian that I'm that I'm more on that side let's say of the of the situation it's been helpful for me to meditate on the on the Saint that's an exception on on the Saint that's a monster on the saint that doesn't quite fit so that I can maintain compassion for that which doesn't fit you know that I can always keep that in mind that we're all kind of not we're all kind of broken we're all kind of doghe headed you know to some extent and that we should be careful uh in our Judgment of people like when I watch you know when I and I I to be honest like I when I see people reposting Tik toks of obviously broken people that are saying insane things but that are obviously broken and then just like getting you know thousands of likes by reposting them to mock them I don't think that's the solution like I don't think that helps anybody you know the the a lot of the people a lot of the blue-haired pink-haired people that are you know cutting off their breasts or that are doing this stuff they are in deep deep suffering and there's a difference between not thinking that their actions and the direction that they're aiming is good you know there's a difference between that like I can say I think this is not good like I think that the Direction with you're aiming that you're aiming is is damaging to you and is dangerous but there's a difference between that and and mocking them or you know pointing to them like you would in a freak Show uh so I would say that those are those are things that I try to avoid getting involved in that's why I said like the culture War stuff is something that I and and some people like confuse me with how can I say this confuse me with my friends or confuse me with people around me because obviously you know I've done some things for the daily wire I've done some things for you know I've done things Peterson and these are all people that I care about and that I that I respect and that I admire but you know I my my life and my Approach is not exactly theirs right it is it is my it is my approach and I and I uh and I think anyway so I try to avoid that kind of stuff as much as I as I can let's say yeah which by the way which is why that I love the I love your approach I think your approach has been very of all of all of the the kind of YouTube approaches I think yours has been fruitful because you speak to people with compassion and you've been able to to to talk to people who would never speak to a right-wing whatever or to to to but that are you know that are that are very far on one side of the culture world but that are willing to talk to you because they know that you'll give them true attention and you won't try to trick them you won't try to you know and trip them up and I think I think that's a I think that's a great approach I think that's way more promising than a lot of the stuff that we're seeing it's not as prominent yeah it's a it's a it's a different strategy it's a long slow yeah you won't get you won't also get as many clicks and you won't get as many views obviously the culture war will get you attention but you know I I I think that the sacrificing that for something better is is worth it you know it's worth it to not play that game oh um we should start wrapping up I do want to you did just publish either a clip or a video on sacrifice I think it was an excerpt from another and I get I didn't get to watch it cuz I was watching another one of your um shows um but could you just talk for a moment about sacrifice and what it is to you I was I was debating with I was I was debating with uh somebody about sacrifice and sacrifice being always giving something up and and if you're giving something up then you don't really I just want to understand it because it just means something to me and and I know that you deal with that symbolism as essential I think it's just essential to my moral framework that was given to me it's just like sacrifices putting something aside to gain not necessarily to gain something else it's not just it's not just transactional in that way I don't think no I I so sacrifice you could say sacrifice is the is the foundation of reality um and uh this is obviously hard for people to understand because we don't live in the in an ancient world again yeah and so the idea that you would take something that is good for example and that you would give it up for something better right you would or you would you would you would kind of offer it up to something which is which is more yeah not necessarily four but two yeah something you sacrifice something no no but how can I say this maybe itent to some extent there is how can I say this we have to we have to be careful like I said not to make it purely transactional um so let let me give you an example that's very simple that everybody can understand it's not it's not magical in any way which is the way that a sports team functions right and so imagine all the players of the team they want to be successful they want to win they want to shine they want you know to be the star of the game they this is something that they they wrestle with like this desire that they have to to do that now the reality is that if they grab on to that they'll lose yeah they'll lose the game they'll lose the prestige to lose everything and so the only way for that desire to embed itself properly in the game is for them to give it up towards a higher purpose and they say I will play in a way that my team will win right I will play in a way that will take into account the reality of the other players so I will sacrifice an aspect of my aspiration to a higher good and the the the mystery is that if you do that that's how you get it in the proper way that's actually how you that aspect of you which is the desire to succeed and to win and to do that will actually shine so that's the mystery of sacrifice right in the story of in scripture you see that especially in the story of the sacrifice of Isaac it's the most obvious version of that which is that God tells Abraham you know uh you're going to have a son and he's like in his 90s and it's like this ridiculous thing like there's no way I'm have a son not only you can have a son but your son will have sons and you'll have so many children right they'll become like the stars of of heaven and so so finally in his 90s God gives him a son and then God says all right now go up the mountain and sacrifice him to me it's like what you just gave me this thing this whole thing that I've everything's been moving towards everything's been moving towards me having this son and now you're saying sacrifice him to me so he goes up the mountain and at the moment when he's willing to give that up to God then God gives him back and says now that it's it's it's like now that you're will now that I know that you're willing to give this up towards a higher good that's how you get it in its proper place that's how that's how it and so you could say so you could say that that's now again this is true about everything right if you if you if you love a woman and you want to make love to her but that's the only thing you want and you're driving towards that and everything's driven towards that like you won't probably get it or not not much but if but if it's given up into a higher good of love and of communion and of and of of of you know aim towards something higher then the surprise is that then it will be returned to you like it will it will come back into your life and that's true about everything right that's how the world actually works that's how Goods scale is is if they give themselves up into higher Goods and that's basically the nature of sacrifice and what does that tell us about love I think that that that's kind of one of the answers of Love Like Love is the process that we witness when we participate in letting go towards something higher that's right that no that's a good that's a good thing is that when we that love always when you're attentive to love you'll realize that it only Finds Its fullness if it's constantly giving up towards the higher and that's the only place in which it reaches fullness and every time we stop and we think that this is the top and it's like if I can only have enough money like if I can only get my retirement fund you know then everything will be solved then you realize that no it's like you're not going to find uh satisfaction in that but if you you know if you if you do those things but you always scale them up towards something which is more meaningful and more powerful and more full full then you know all those things you know what is it that Christ says he says search first for the kingdom of God and all those things will be given to you that is don't worry about the things the the lower things if you aim to the top those lower things they'll figure themselves out like they will they will play themselves out uh but if you try to grasp any of them then you lose them you know that's the the mystery is it is the mystery of love but it's also that's the nature of sacrifice that's what the function of sacrifice God is good but it's yeah but you can so but it's funny because like people don't understand it because they see the ritualized version and then they don't understand what ritual is for and so they just see it as a weird thing it's like okay so you go to this place and then you kill a goat you know and you burn it and you give it up to God like what the hell are you doing like what is this like what are you why does this matter like why are you doing that uh and you can only understand it if you apply it like you can you can let's take the family meal again a family meal is a good example to understand sacrifice you know you have a family potluck it's a that's even better example right and so everybody comes and everybody offers their food up to the family right to something Beyond them and so it's a sacrifice right it's it really is that's now you're really in the world of sacrifice like you know Aunt so and so she makes her casserole or whatever she brings it to the potluck and then she offers it up to the family and then the the the the the blessing will come back down right and so we will sit around the table and then we'll have a feast we'll eat the food right we'll get the food but the food is offered up to the family it's not just you standing at the on the corner of your of your of your table and just eating standing right it's like it's a ritualized offering up to the family and if you make an improper sacrifice you know what that what happens right if you make an improper sacrifice if you do it especially if you do it quite a few times what do you mean that that is that if you don't offer your best right if everybody brings their prepared meal and you come and you don't you know you don't put any effort into it that will affect to some extent your participation in the family it will affect or it will reflect your participation in the family it will it will reflect your Unity your your participation in the unity of the family yeah and so so that's exactly though the the whole sacrificial system the sacrifice is more complicated but that part of the sacrificial system uh can you you can understand it just by the way in which you do things like that right in the way in which you give the way in which you give gifts to others for example in which you take something good and you give it to the friendship that binds you to the other person because obviously when you're giving a gift to someone you're not just giving it to the person you're offering it to the union of both of you together that's a sacrifice it's the same thing as when people would offer goats up to God it's just at a very at a at a lower level yeah but Stacks it Stacks that's right it Stacks what's coming up for you do you have any tours I'm trying to not travel as much last year was yeah last year was crazy you know they especially because when Co ended I just said yes to everything and then all of a sudden I was like gone all the time and so I've been trying to to tone down the travel to have more time with the family and also trying to find ways to travel with my wife or with my family uh so that you know it's not such of a you know it's not such of a weird situation um and so that's so that been careful with that but I would think the thing I'm most excited about is the is the new publishing company do you know I think you probably saw started a publishing company called symbolic World Press um and uh publishing Fairy Tales um you know I'm writing eight fairy tales that were publishing beautifully Illustrated with uh yeah it's so it's yeah let me show you I got it right here please this is our our Snow White yeah and it's it was illustrated by Christ uh by Heather pollington who is an amazing illustrator she's just like just astounding yeah she's just great yeah she's really good it's like it's so I'm really excited about that and we're we're working hard people can buy that now yeah people can well I mean we're we're shipping them right now because we we did it as a crowdfunder uh and so we actually today like it's things are being shipped like like today uh and so you get people can find it on uh uh I still have a pre-order store open on backer kit people can find if the rights in the white Jonathan P or something um and that's what I'm most excited about because we're gonna we're going to continue to publish the graphic novels and then I'm going to write these fairy tales as a kind of Symphony of of fairy tales um and uh and yeah that's the thing that I'm most excited about although I still I'm still making videos still doing the YouTube thing but it's getting harder I feel how so feel like I'm running out of the things that I wanted to say it's like at some point I pretty much said what I want to say and I'm thinking okay what am I gonna talk about you know yeah yeah yeah that that's you find that but you have like these discussions with like all these people so yeah yeah well I mean you get into you know it just kind of comes and goes it's like life you know it's like you know it rains and then it then it dries up and my in and also with my interest you know my like do I really like am I do I want to talk about gender anymore and yeah and then I feel bad for my audience they want to hear more about it and then I publish a gender episode and a lot of people watch it I'm like well at least you know at least it's working at least the Channel's working you know but like I'm always I'm kind of looking for like what's the new thing what's the next thing like what what's cool what's next what's what's good where's the good in the world and I'm not really I don't really that's what I that's why I I've kind of moveed towards the idea of telling stories yeah rather than just talking about it so I've been talking about symbolism for like five six years now and I thought okay well I have to stop just talking about it let's do it let's tell better stories you know yeah and since all the companies all the like big media companies are just dropping these these fairy tales they don't want them anymore H just take them you know because they're yeah it's an opportunity it's amazing it's a great [Laughter] opportunity so uh people can order so these books will be coming out over the course of the next year or so these books I mean so we're we're we're going to try to speed we're going to like ramp up so basically the idea is to you know use the funds for the from the first books to finance this the next ones and so we had a pretty good run with the crowdfunder and so we we're we're financing the second one even starting the third one uh and so hopefully we can start to put them out regularly either either two at a time or something we're not sure um so yeah so it'll be coming out soon we try to do it as fast as we can but we definitely want them to be as beautiful as possible that's W to get my hands and some like to go against the AI thing that's happening right it's like to to to just say we're g to make the most beautiful high quality thought out uh story and the idea is to use some aspects of postmodern storytelling you know this idea of self-referentiality and Alo the idea of um of a kind of meta awareness that you see in postmodern stories like in Shack for example when they they have this kind of weird uh meta awareness of the of their storytelling uh but to do that towards Insight rather than towards cynicism oh yeah it's a basic sorry yeah people people mistake the postmodern uh tactics for the postmodern goal and and you can use those T the tactics are very rich especially the artistic ones they just don't they don't have they're not wedded to cynicism people think that they're wedded to like being met as cynical like no it's not necessarily it's there's a lot of fun there there's a lot of like you break it apart to put it back together you don't just break it apart to break it apart you break it apart to put it back together that's part of like it serves the story it serves to Crea it makes the story even more creative because it engages the reader and the reader you know is invited to particip to embed themselves into the interpretation of the story which is a part of the story interpretation is a part of the story it's not something that comes after or controls the story defines the story it's a part it's an intrical part of the story it's a participation part it's like where the story it's like the genitals of the story kind it's the part of the story that that faces outward or that that incubates the new yeah I totally agree so all all the postmodern strategies of Storytelling are like are there in Shakespeare like they'll have plays Within the play they'll have even even a lot of the kind of confusing of identity where you know it's like someone uh you know pretending to be something playing something else and so everything kind of slips and starts to fragment and there's a kind of awareness of the secret hidden behind it all of these strategies are are definitely useful and that's what so basically that's what I'm trying to do with fairy tales is to we're doing eight fairy tales and they're going to become symphonic As you move forward so we'll set up a little like a a story and a world at the beginning and then there'll be crisscrossing as you move forward you know with objects and people and characters and surprises in the story uh where you know you can use for example Sleeping Beauty falling asleep to help you understand Snow White falling asleep so you can it's not just like a it's not just a uh it's not just a an Easter egg reference right it's like it's a reference that now connects you and helps you understand more deeply what is going on there so basically using the the repetitive nature of of um fairy tales to actually bring more insight into them anyways so there are few of the strategies to use but that's the idea and to make them in a way that you can read it to an eight-year-old but that as an adult you're also like huh okay I didn't realize that that's what was going on there you know like the the okay so this is what this is what's being uh referred to so hopefully bring insight to adults as well but that's the that's the play do you have a my wife wants us to start a Bible study uh with the kids and I'm wondering um like what would be good for 12 where would you start like if you're doing a a a Bible reading for for 12 10 years olds what you think David or Kings or judges or yeah judges maybe not judges no well I had to learn I had to learn the hard way because with my kids I was like I'm just going to tell them the Bible stories and then I had them like crying you know when they were like okay that's not the way to go do you start with lot and his daughters is that exactly I right away with L and his daughters that was the first story I told them where like the in judges write the story of the judge that cuts his the his his mistress into 12 pieces like all these crazy stories there are crazy stories in the Bible for sure but um I think that I think that uh kids should know for sure Genesis is really important you know the creation story The Flood uh the story of Abraham um Genesis Exodus those stories are are crucial because they are pattern making like they are really uh Cosmic in their implications they they have the the deepest levels of Storytelling in them um and then then really the story of Jesus so it's like the story Genesis Exodus and Jesus is probably the best place to to start with with kids uh and then later you can go into uh you can go into other stories like you can talk you can go further into the Old Testament you know taking the promised land and then uh David King David all those stories and then some of the stories of the prophets like some of the stories of Elijah and Elisha are really are really interesting for kids but uh I would start with that the one about U making fun of a man a bald man yeah I made a video about that about the the the she the she bears that comes and eats the young people Goble Goble yeah well jonan thank you so much for uh taking time on your busy schedule to speak with me about this you know I I I didn't want to talk I didn't want a gossipy thing I just want to kind of drill down into this divide about how we approach this like this really high level thinking about like well if our society is just do whatever you want um how do we survive and and how do we start to collectivize and and I think that you and James basically have the same answer just in different formulations like you have to start with yourself and you have to not be hum you're not the god of anybody else like you you stand before reality and you have to be honest and humble in that and build it block by block and and he's more of on the reason side and you're more on the virtue side or like like talk speak in in in terms of of Love um you know and and and and that but I think that you're both I I I don't see any terrible divide between you two so I wanted to like kind of facilitate for my own mind for your own sake I agree I don't have a problem with James at all I always followed his work from the very beginning I think that the work he's doing uh you know showing the relationship between uh between communism and postmodernism and showing the line you know you know to to between the between grami and how feeds into the 60s and then the postmodern I think it's one of the most useful things that is being done right now in the in the intellectual life and so I was actually like kind of shocked that he came after me with such vehement and I was like okay like I guess but I am a Christian I don't know what to tell you I'm not going to change that and I do believe that Christianity is the best story uh but I don't identify as a Christian nationalist I don't even know exactly what that is I think it's think it's I think it's a category that was made up by people like Rob Riner honestly uh so yeah so I anyway so it's too bad but you know if he ever wants to talk by the way if you watch this I'd be happy to talk to him I don't have a problem with him yeah no absolutely maybe someday hopefully maybe who knows I'm gonna end the recording thank you very much for joining me all right yeah thanks
