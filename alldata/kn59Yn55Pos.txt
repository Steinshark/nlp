all right you guys want to do this uh again I know we've done quite a few Jonathan Blow ones but I just love his takes because they're just they're just far enough from how I have takes that they bother me but they're just close enough that you could convince me maybe that it's true right there's something about it that's just really cool I like listening to things that in general I disagree with something about it I don't know what it is and so this is very exciting very smart engineer let's see it very excited about this why Jonathan Blow on open source software here we go open source software has been stagnant for 20 plus years if uh does he know anything about react okay think about the think about this one you got higher first off you have class components you have higher order components you have functional components you have hooks you would now have react server components apparently this man knows nothing about open Stars am I right am I right I mean come on clearly right in your UI as if it's a server is going to be just one of the greatest inventions of mankind if I thought it was doing a good job why would I have to do something else open source software also almost never does anything creative all they ever do is copy other things interesting is that true I mean the the hard part about that is obviously the the hard the hard part about that is obviously um you know when you really think about it days since um last JavaScript framework uh is I mean they're always creating something new so I do think that there is something to that that maybe it's like the world in which you're working in that makes it a little bit different and so like in the JavaScript world I mean if you've thought of it you should probably build it and open source it generally how it works but I am curious the date is a couple years ago uh but I like this take which is you know the more I think about it are people doing something uniquely you knew in the open source world I don't know I'd say yeah I think personally yes but let's let them cook okay let's let them cook yeah yeah I think so Judo it tends to be the better copy in a kind of a bad way they're very bad at creativity for some reason you will never know why I don't submit pull requests the idea of a pull request is offensive kind of right it's like hey go do all this work and then I the guy you can submit to me your request that I pay attention to your work and then I the guy who decides what goes in will decide to take your work or not right um by definition of guy who decides and if I decide not to then you wasted your time right like everyone pretend oh I I do want to pause on that that's it is a really good point which I think we can all agree that open source work is a largely thankless job and those that are the ones just simply making the changes but not owning the repos they're one of the biggest Heroes of them all they get none of the street cred and they get all of the hassle like that is it is very very respectable very very difficult stuff and I definitely don't want to uh minimize what they do and so I think that he has a very good point here which is that it is like a genuinely shitty relationship open source is super Democratic but there's inherently a very strong class structure there right yeah so if you support authoritarian Democratic you're kind of lower class in a sense right yeah I mean I I I'm agreeing with it but second off it open source is not Democratic there's nothing Democratic about open source people always have this like idea that Democrat or uh that open source is like the People's Choice For Stuff it's actually largely authoritarian it's whoever is in charge Whoever has merged privileges chooses the you know the line and the thing is is that I say no to PRS constantly it's not communist it's it's it's authoritarian it's kingship it's monarchy it's whatever whatever you want to call it where there's it's a very small amount of people that make the choice and there's a very large amount of people who wish to use it or make changes to it you can you 've got your own country that's the beautiful part about open source creating your own country well fascism and and communism art are virtually the same when it comes to hierarchies of power but it is like they're they're not like that it's a little bit different I think we're I think trying to relate them to a political structure might not be the best way to go about this whole open source thing I think what it really is is that somebody draws in an imaginary piece of land that they are King but their land comes with benefits and if you like their land you can look at their land and you can even suggest changes to the land but they may say no you can get an identical copy of their land and create your own land based off their land and there's nothing they can do about it just saying it's a weird it's like there's no political you can't really relate it to anything especially on a giant project like llvm the fact that I think they have such bad taste and everything there's something very uh negative about submitting to the Judgment of people who you believe have very bad taste do you know what I mean what's the alternative to pull request for open source just so everyone commit whatever no um mechanism by which you admit trusted people and then just don't don't take contributions from other people hmm let's try to think about that for a second let's just let's try out his thought on this in a sense well it's not a stupid take it's an interesting take which is you effectively set up a set of people who are willing to contribute and those are the people who can contribute and everybody else can't contribute they can like issue requests is my guess that's it like hey this doesn't really work for me uh to me it doesn't yeah I think scaling is a huge issue no it'd be open source meaning you can still look at it you can understand it but you can't uh you can't simply make pull requests do I agree with this take I mean that's honestly that's more like how Google does open source like when you really if you don't know anything about Google's General structures is that typically at least earlier it may have changed today but typically you couldn't just make a PR to one of Google ran open source projects it the change has to be effectuated from somebody within there's like this there there was like a ring of people who could make changes in a ring of people who could make changes the Ring of people who could make changes was everybody yeah open source closed command is that a bad thing I'm not going to say it's a bad thing it's a different thing would we have better software today I don't know like this idea that people have where they're like this is the one way to do it because this is what is I don't agree with that but I also agree with it all at the exact same time right tradition and history make a huge impact in what we do today but is it always the best I don't know a lot of thoughts go in my head okay a lot of thoughts okay okay did I just turn into Chris Farley almost right there I felt like that was like a Chris Farley Charlie Day five dollar a month girl twitch Extravaganza right there I don't know how you work that out but you work that out somehow I think that would result in higher quality and much less friction yeah it's like for anything the level of complexity that llvm or whatever is either people really know the code and can contribute or they barely know the code and it takes more effort to make their stuff usable than then it's worth it it's like you could have just done it faster right I do agree with this take in a sense that if you like go look at uh T Pope he writes all of his plugins in vimscript vinscript's a very Arcane very nuanced very educated I mean the language itself is an edge case it's not like there is nothing but an edge case you're like oh what'd you do there well did you know you're like what did I do wrong uh it's a permanent you just did the wrong thing and he is extremely good at it and so he even says like don't try to make the change just tell me what you want and I will try to see if I can do it quickly because of just how arcane like the stuff is and so I I totally can I can buy that argument in very complex open source right so you're talking about anything that requires enough pre-existing knowledge to be useful this is also why I think if you are giving uh you should consider giving to open source projects like everyone should give some level of money to the project they use the most right I think this is very very important aspect you know just throwing that out there and that's sort of the flaw in the open source patches welcome model is it it doesn't exactly conceptually make sense the open source philosophy new day new time to be upset about open source let's go is the current open source philosophy is everybody can program and everybody can check stuff in and it's always positive to do that and help and you're building the software along with everyone else so I think if someone sees someone like Casey criticized code that's checked in in that way it might at least subliminally and maybe consciously reverberate like oh if I check in something I could be judged in such a negative way and I don't want that but actually hmm like that rah-rah everybody's happy and holding flowers picture of software development is wrong it matters if you check in stuff that is very good or if you check in stuff that is mediocre or if you check in stuff that is bad that matters it matters a lot um and people need to be aware that it matters and the way that you evaluate that is via people having strong opinions about what is good code and what is not good code right there may be more or less productive ways to express those opinions for sure but I do want to take a moment on that one that's actually hey you do always got to respect a man who cuts the sleeves off his T-shirt absolutely and cuts the neck hole that's his that's a custom neck hole okay that's custom that's that's vintage um but I do think there's something very important to this which is how you first present yourself especially in the open source community there is definitely some I mean he's absolutely right like if you make a PR that's just kind of horseshit like you thought you fixed something but you just didn't really think about it you just threw it all in there and that's that you can give yourself a negative reputation which may not even be wanted right or you see somebody who you think is really smart which is what he just said earlier and they get raked over the coals for a PR and it makes it feel like you could never submit something I do think there is something there's there's definitely a good observation in in that right a good little piece of takeaway so if you're going to do something public make sure you um you know take a moment to double check what you do uh make sure you don't get caught off guard ask some people some questions maybe beforehand uh before you do that you know I think there's a lot of I think there's a lot of good things you could think about right there social problem yeah social problems exist ever exactly let's argue is good too if you lose that culture of technical judgment about what is good and what is bad then software is over then literally software becomes critical basket weaving right I feel like there's a joke that he must make regular because critical basket weaving I just I don't even understand what becomes what that I don't even know I don't even know and you might feel happy about that for a couple years because you get to participate and feel good but like it's not it's not a good place to go you don't want you don't want computers to go there so there's two store two levels to this if what you're objecting to is the criticism then you're just anti-engineering and that's no good right if what you're objecting is to is the the flavor and attitude and the nature with which Casey was expressing his criticism then there's a little bit more of a point there however again you eliminate that at your peril right interesting interesting interesting there is something very unique about software that when you when you write something when you build something and someone criticizes it I think there's this inherent thing I think we all are guilty of doing it that it's not the code that they're criticizing but I think it's often easy to think that it's you with whom they're criticizing and second up I think there's also especially in the open source world there's a gigantic language and culture barrier that people who seem like they're just might be somebody who's different than you right like this is a real thing you see this all the time um and so I definitely think there's like there's there's a lot there and then thirdly you have somebody who's probably answered the same question 500 times and therefore they just like write out a terse answer because they've seen it and that's that what do I think of the actic solution or the actors thing for those that don't know there's this whole acts thing in 2009 that everyone got all upset and uh I honestly when I read it I didn't understand why everyone was pissed off like when I read it nothing about it seemed that shocking I was actually more shocked at how many people said it was an ordeal when it was just like a guy who was terse who said I don't really want to do that right like that that's it like the owner of actors was like I don't really want to do that I don't see why I need to do this and they're just like oh you know and it just like blew up and you're just like okay whoa whoa it kind of seems like the community is kind of shitty in this situation whereas the owner was just maybe more tersed than he could have been but it also turns out he was like super Russian I don't know if there's like Russian and super Russian but he's like super Russian and just communicated in a very direct way and that's just like not what anyone was used to and so everyone in the rust Community which is known for being maybe a little softer just couldn't handle the super Russian nature of super Russian man and just like dilapidated under the fact that he's just like unsafe code is pot of rust and they're just like you know like it just like exploded it is it is perfectly fine to have unsafe rust I can only deal with Russian accent if I have sad face like I cannot do it doesn't I cannot do Russian accents without angry face and I have to admit somewhere the taliano just I don't even know if it's Russian okay I don't even know anyways back to the story it is well known that many of the greatest contributors to society not just in software but in all science and technology and the Arts everywhere many of those people have been hard to work with for one reason or another and partially that's because they care tremendously about what they are doing they care tremendously about the form in which they are working all right he's right uh I I believe if I'm not mistaken Gauss was considered like a full and so was Euler if I'm not mistaken very very well known for being like super you might say oh but that guy doesn't need to be crotchety and mean about that thing but you can't you can't like take away that part of the personality and have everything else right because that part of the personality is quite likely an integral part of what made the rest of the artist or the scientist as good as they are [Music] I really like that take honestly real talk I love that take which is there's a part of someone that cares so much that it's easy to become an because what you see as simple other people look at as complex because of your depth of knowledge and then on top of that there is like this constant desire to make something better and so there is definitely there's something about that I mean I always personally want to err on the side of communicating well um but I'm not necessarily disagreeing with this take I've met people who've like I've met I I can think of one person who's exceptionally smart we're talking one of the smartest people I've ever met and communicates in a more terse fashion and it's because he really cares about things and so could he could you get more flies with honey yeah but would he still be the person out there fighting right like that's that's a it's a really good point which is do you take away the thing in which gives that person their uniqueness by robbing them of that I don't know I don't know right you can't like just decide Albert Einstein should have had a different personality but he should have still done all the cool relativity stuff and figured all that out and then I'm gonna sit on my couch and eat Cheetos and I'll criticize Einstein for not being a good person in some certain way that a hundred years later I decide is the right way to be but but I will take all the stuff that he contributed because it helps me eat Cheetos and that's great right honestly this is a really good point applies to Modern software as well which is like it's very easy from an armchair quarterback to say what is good and what is bad but the people actually doing the work like they're the ones that are getting raked quite frequently whereas it's the people that aren't even apart it's the crowd it's the people that want to be on the side of whatever that jump in on these things you know it's very interesting you can say anything you want on the internet and inevitably somebody will negatively say some counter position to you no matter what even if they have absolutely no experience you Rich Harris can get up there and say I like JS docs and he got like on the front page of Hacker News people are saying how ridiculous it is how do they do generic they're just saying a bunch of false stuff because they actually haven't used the technology but there's this like idea that they're they're actually smart enough to make judgments about it and they don't know nothing right it is very interesting this it's a very I mean it happens in all forms of society that's so like that it is important for us to see that kind of lazy bloated fat uh social criticism of others as as being as toxic as it actually is and is being as unproductive and Decay inducing as it actually is that's way more toxic than a programmer saying angry things that kind of criticism because because that kind of criticism that's in Vogue in places like Twitter right now is um it's not in Vogue for what it what is on Twitter Twitter is based on that Twitter is the outcome of people having shitty opinions that's it that that is what Twitter is it would not exist without the well actually at a large scale it will destroy Human Society whereas the crotchety programmer thing on a large scale built a large part of the human society that we have right now okay so like be very careful with that stuff and on my part I feel that one of the better contributions that I can make is to not tolerate that kind of criticism like I just won't put up with it you know if you come to this Channel with that kind of thing I just I'll just ban you because it's stupid and I don't have time for it and uh yeah there's too much of it it's cheap it's it's cheap all it is is posturing so that you know the person making the criticism can feel better can show other people that they are a good person and it's gross it's really gross and and it's destructive we don't need it so I I genuinely do think he has a lot of correctness on this um I do I I want to I I want to say this one point which I think is really important I don't fully agree with the statement right like if you come in here and you and you and you say that I'm not communicating you know nice enough or whatever I do try to consider those things right I think that's probably because I just have a bit more of a social aspect or I feel responsible for my words not like I do feel some sort of level responsibility but at the same time I think that there is also just this inherent problem that exists which is there's like a plane of of IQ if you will or whatever right the IQ curve which is you probably have like the dumb and smart guy on the side being like Taurus communication is great but the middle ground guy it's like I'm just so I just hate everybody who communicates angrily I think they should all just have to quit software and lose their jobs I hate everything about them right like that that that plane does exist where it's kind of funny uh where there's like this this this very interesting oopsie Daisy that exists um I don't know I think you should always strive to be good no matter what I think it always is good to think about what would you feel if you had everything you said put up for people to see right I think I think that's just a I I personally that's how I try to operate if I'd be proud to have everyone see what I'm saying then I I'm fine saying it even if it's hurtful then I think that's fine but that's kind of generally how I try to do it this is a good one by the way this is a really good one I just can't play it on YouTube I can't play it from this machine because YouTube will will demonetize me anyways just thought just a thought I don't disagree I don't fully agree I do think people that are saying that you know that that largely complain about these things uh I think that if you had the same level of accomplishment as the person you're complaining against I think it'd go a lot further right like I think if you know Casey is really well known in the code and in this like performance whatever community so is John right Jonathan so if Casey said yo John I think you're being a little harsh in this situation I think he would hear it better so I do think that there is like this pure aspect where if you wish to make a change you also need to be on a similar plane I think it does help a lot um yeah I I just think it just exists that way right it's very hard um it's very hard I don't know it's interesting I think it's interesting nonetheless good thing to always think about credibility credibility makes a huge is very very important right if someone tells me I'm stupid and they're one week into programming not gonna lie I don't really care you know I uh don't necessarily care
