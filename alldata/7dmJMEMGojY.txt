the top speed of the pod is about um 25 kilometers an hour that's not where we're going to be operating in the range of but that's what it's potential and it can do about 35 kilometers uh on a single charge um so more than that's getting up and down there's the uh it's milking central for quite a few hours we've got about 10 on site today and so we always use all the containers you can see behind us and the containers are for two reasons obviously storage is one but the second is as you can observe from the video it's quite a barren site and so it doesn't really mimic a city center very well so they're strategically placed for the lidar so in town when we're driving around there's always going to be walls buildings and trees to bounce off and that's how you navigate through lidar but so that's where we are so you create a map so you have to travel around a couple of times you could do it off one but um one doesn't work very well because if there's something in the way say a burden lidar or someone's standing in the way that would be picked up in as an environment and then when the pod would travel around it would be looking for that person again so you've got to do it a couple of times to basically remove them and only get static features that are always going to be there so there's a couple of things a couple of sensors here that slider up there that is our navigation lidar so that's bouncing off the containers that's how it navigates we also will have lidar down here we're currently looking at different types so there are internal lidars indoor lidars and there are external lidars and as you can imagine internal lidars don't deal with sunlight very well so that's why we're having to experiment with outdoor lidars and basically find the one that best suits our needs there's thousands of different applications for it and there's quite a few makers so we're finding the right ones the whole reason for our project the goal is to make them affordable to councils you know budgets can't they're not limitless so we're trying to find a way how do you provide an excellent service with good quality whilst remaining like attainable for councils really so there's a lot of options for lidar as you can probably imagine that's finding which one suits our needs which one performs well without going beyond the grasp of like council bodies basically where do we start with this how do we go for a ride we're going to have a qr code scanner here um and you would provide you use your phone to access the pod we have buttons on the inside and the outside um so they open the doors and so we would we would get in and it would know that you're in because you scan for the purposes of the video we're going to show it on laptop because it's easy to see you look like you've got an xbox controller yeah right yeah with most heavy machinery and test uh test vehicles you have a dead man switch um so that's if anything goes wrong or some reason we need to stop um you lego of the trigger and it stops so that's what i'm doing here i'm not controlling the vehicle i'm just holding the the dead man we're off we've got a kilometer track of our sight and as you can see on the laptop now so you're seeing our vis the circles are each waypoint and so waypoints have a location on the x y and z and they also have a speed and that's the speed of the part as it goes through it we would map the center in lidar and you would also map it through waypoints it would then compute its own routes if you wanted to go from one specific place to another there would be waypoints for that so we need to map the whole center basically and so right now it's got about 60 wave points for our site and this is about two meters a second and the idea of the project is to basically be twice walking speed that's what the uh the council specifications will and that's what we want to do because we're operating on roadways they're still open to the public and cyclists um so there's an appropriate speed that we need to follow we go out to the train station where there's lots and lots of people and we've offered a few people that so far there's a big santander hq here um so we've had many people have been and people always want a waypoint to weather spoons on a friday evening quite soon we're going to be doing autonomous trials outside in the uh in public we're going to start with no passengers and then we're going to slowly add passengers and more stops to our trials um we envisage a thing we've coined a pod club so we're going to take 100 people for a kind of beta phase so that we have to trial the vehicles for destinations they'd like on our on our circuit and by september we hope to offer a public service it's quite bumpy isn't it yes the site's been abandoned since milton keynes was built so it's out of 50 years of misuse really particularly this section this is very one bit but the site offers just over a kilometer of private track and it's in such perfect location it's quite bumpy here in a way it's quite good because this is much worse than um any of the red waves we'd be running in so we can really put the pod through its paces here it's a proper test track yeah proper test right exactly and if it can deal with this it will have absolutely no problem center you're traveling along and you suddenly realize that you need to go to the shop what do you do we have a so obvious has a built-in council feature and so that's part of why we're here later in coming months we're going to be talking with the public a lot and part of that point is getting their feedback and seeing what they'd like to see so we've already started that so we've talked about you know the qr scanner and ease of use um also ramps with the vehicle so if you were in a wheelchair you could as easily access it as as anyone else um so yeah i'm looking forward to that because it's going to be a chance to let the public really have a look tear down of the vehicle um because you can have the uh you can have exactly what you think works but it's always good to get the uh the public who will eventually be the end users of it to have their say this is the software used for the pod to navigate and so this ties directly into all of the internal so the steering controller the brakes all of that is controlled from here so if i zoom in on one particular waypoints this is waypoint one as you can see it's got two meters a second so that's the speed it's going to go through this arrow and you can place them with a uh with a 2d nav goal and give it its orientation and then the important bit is you've got to compute before every route this is the loop it's going to do you're probably wondering what all of these lines are so this is actually the lidar map so this is how it navigates so each rectangle here is one of the containers when we're driving in lidar it's looking for these objects the dark black outlines are something that's 100 sure is there there's very little kind of pass through it's all reflected um and so that's ideally what what we'd aim for um the gray so it's on a kind of black scale so the gray is is something it's less raw so if you did it right through a window it would come out great because some gets reflected because it's not a solid object and white obviously it ignores so that's shooting into open space and you uh you can't navigate off that so sometimes we do pick up a bush but because the bush is quite large and it's not going anywhere um it's actually quite a good um navigational feature so looking at that map there yeah obviously those are good landmarks but looks like the majority is done by gps would that be right uh this this right now is only running off gps right that loop just then was um purely off gps because that's what we're working on today um and we have uh so we that's what i'm saying so we're in the process of kind of tying them together um because right now we're confident that it can navigate off gps alone and it can navigate off lighter and as we're meshing it together we're also going to start doing autonomous runs in milton keynes um and so the the gb the gps is um so obviously via satellite the base station um but it communicates through a network so is that that's a mesh network it's a mesh yeah so make sure it's got coverage wherever it is yeah we can get a visual representation of the strength of the gps that we're receiving the blue is although might not come through on the camera they're individual ticks so the gps is in constant communication with the pod so if that blue line disappears we know we're not getting the coverage we need and the pod will actually stop our number one goal right now is to make sure the two bottom levels of navigation so the lidar and the gps can navigate independently and if they can independ independently navigate um obviously when you put them together they're just that more and more safe so that's the goal right now so i think the fleet here is about six thousand kilometers the last couple of months and so we're continually building that they're still building pods in um in commentary and shipping them down here and to put them through the paces and i should caveat this by saying i'm going to be talking general terms each operating system whether that's windows linux macos ios bsd insert your favorite operating system here that you probably
