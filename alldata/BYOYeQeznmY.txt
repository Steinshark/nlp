hello everyone and welcome in this video sponsored by advanced auto parts charles hey mr humble mechanic and i are going to be talking about what to do when your car doesn't have any heat we are indeed i'm excited so charles was a dealer technician for quite some time how many years about 14 years seen a lot of broken cars years a couple that didn't have heat believe it a couple that didn't have heat so charles is going to help us walk through the scenarios of what's going on with your car and why doesn't it have heat might even get some tips on how to actually figure out which part is the problem amazing speaking of parts a big thank you to advance auto parts for sending parts for this video demonstration you can use the advanced auto parts mobile app for your car part needs parts let's start off with a quick overview of how the seating system is going to heat up your cabin so we're going to start with the engine and the engine is going to have coolant jackets surrounding it so as that engine gets warm it's going to heat up those cooling jackets and then you're going to have a water pump circulate that coolant to different areas around your car it'll send up to the front of the car where it will go through the radiator to help keep the engine cool and it can send that coolant to your heater core so then you can use that heat along with an electric fan and take the heat blow air through this heater core and into your cabin keep you nice and warm and toasty when it's cold outside toasty toasty having a car with no heat is a miserable driving experience agreed so charles here's the question i'm a customer i come into your shop i bring my my car put it up on the lift and say charles my heater doesn't work what's the deal where are we going to start yeah so this really depends on the kind of car but initially my first thing is i'm gonna walk around the car make sure there's no damage say the radiator smashed in uh we got we got a lot of problems that we have to deal with once i feel good about the overall visual condition of the exterior of the car we'll move to the inside first step is to do nothing and just evaluate the customer's settings believe it or not i have had complaints if my heat doesn't work and it was because the dial wasn't set to hot uh which this is a pretty basic setup but on a lot more complicated systems i actually totally understand if you were colorblind maybe it wouldn't be obvious which one to turn into exactly sometimes they put temperatures on them and makes you feel dumb because you don't know how much it is in celsius after i've made sure the car actually has the heat set we're gonna do a little bit more basic evaluations i'll probably take a thermometer and drop it in the vent so that i can look at what the temperature actually is as opposed to feeling what it is hot to you and hot to me might be very different so then i'm going to start playing with the dials and seeing what happens i'm going to turn the fan all the way to high to make sure we actually have air flow coming out of the vents i'm going to move the direction knob and change the location of the blend doors to see if air flow changes there too do we have it coming out of the defrost the face and the feet okay so you mentioned blend or there what is this thing and how does it work yeah so the way it works depends on the heating and air conditioning system of the car but the very simple definition is it's a small door that changes our direction of airflow so sometimes this changes the temperature sometimes this changes where the air actually flows they all kind of function about the same though okay and so if it were to get stuck on one position that could prevent you absolutely so if you have this blender and say this way is hot and this way is cold if it's stuck on cold even when you turn the dial of course you're never going to get any heat in the cabin and what i do it's kind of this weird little trick that a lot of cars do as you rotate the dial on either the direction of airflow or temperature when the blend door closes a lot of times it makes a noise or you can actually hear something happening and i'm not so concerned with what exactly is happening at this point i just want to hear something happen so i know that when i turn these dials it's doing something all right so we've walked around the outside of the car everything looks to be fine we've then gotten inside the car we're looking at the temperature settings looking at the control settings everything seems to work so far where are we going next so one thing before we move to under the hood which is going to be our next step i also make sure i look at the coolant temperature gauge in the instrument cluster to make sure that the vehicle's actually up to operating temperature if it's not up to operating temperature there's no way we can extract that heat from the heater core and that also may point to an issue we're having under the hood as opposed to inside the car all right let's move under the hood right so once we are under the hood the first thing i look at is the coolant itself i'm looking at level and condition if we have a bunch of stuff floating around in our coolant that could point to an issue with perhaps a clogged heater core and it's definitely worth mentioning never open the cooling system while it's hot that is under pressure and that can lead to severe injury now charles mentioned looking at the coolant level but this is a contained system so if the coolant level is actually low there there's no reason that coolant should be used up over time so you then have to start to look for why is my coolant low exactly and that can come in a number of forms the most common is just a simple coolant leak uh radiator any of the components could could be causing that leak if you do this evaluation of a leak and you don't see anything honestly my next thought is the leak might be coming from the heater core and actually leaking into the cabin of the car if our system is completely sealed then maybe we have an issue with the coolant burning in the engine and you would probably notice that with the vehicle walk around if it's running seeing that smoke come from the exhaust exactly you'll probably see a white smoke and usually when an engine is burning coolant in any significant capacity it has a very distinct sweet smell yes so if you do end up finding a coolant leak obviously that needs to be addressed because this can lead to larger problems yes definitely fix that first however if we look at our coolant the level's fine the condition's fine where are we moving next next we're going to move to evaluating coolant flow throughout the system this starts by measuring the temperature of coolant hoses both before and after the thermostat to make sure that we don't have a stuck thermostat say one hose is really hot and on the back side of the thermostat is ice cold that means we're not letting coolant flow properly through the thermostat so this right here is a thermostat and it's a helpful little device for keeping your engine within a certain temperature range and so what it does initially is it closes off so that when you first start your car and it's cold it allows that engine to keep the coolant that's beside it beside it for that short duration where it needs to warm up then once it gets to operating temperature this thermostat opens up and it allows for that coolant to flow to the radiator so then it simply becomes a balancing act where this thermostat regulates how much flow you're allowing to come out of that engine block to go up to the radiator so that your engine maintains its ideal temperature it really should stay within a pretty narrow range that your engine temperature is going to sit at and actually so i had a thermostat fail on my first car my integra and the way that i kind of noticed that something was going wrong is that as i was driving if i would go down a really long hill i could actually watch my coolant temperature go down so the car is still running and yet the coolant temperature is decreasing and that indicated to me okay the coolant is still going through the radiator when it doesn't need to so the thermostat was cracked open it had failed open yeah they can actually fail both ways failing stuck open that's typically the symptom is the heat doesn't work in the car or my car never gets all the way up to temperature most of the time when it feels stuck closed it's a more severe problem because it's overheat so your engine gets too hot that hot coolant is never allowed to exit the engine flow through our radiator and cool back down and so if it does fail closed can you still have heat you may or you may not because you don't have that flow you're probably not getting enough hot coolant up to the heater core that's typically the highest point in your cooling system now this style of thermostat is a pretty basic style and it's important to note on a modern car with advanced cooling systems this might actually be electronically controlled by the engine computer and so rather than maybe temperature checking the hoses you might use a scan tool to evaluate how well this is functioning all right so aside from our thermostat what else are we looking at as far as this coolant flow most likely next i'm going to move to the water pump and see how much coolant is actually moving through the system it's important to note that you can do these in different orders depending on what the car is telling you or really depending on how easy it is to access some of these components critically important to the heating system is the heater core it has heat right in the name it's got heat in the name yeah so these can fail in really three main ways we can have a clogged heater core so if our coolant was contaminated a lot of times that stuff will settle in the heater core causing no heat low heat or really weirdly heat on like one side of the car or the other depending on the design we can also have a heater core that leaks which means that the interior of your car will probably smell sweet like syrup and the third way and for me kind of the most aggravating way is an air pocket stuck in the heater core a lot of times heater cores are oriented in a strange way or maybe they're the highest point of the cooling system which makes bleeding the air out of the system really tricky and even a small air bubble inside of a heater core can lead to reduced heat all right so we've covered the common components we've talked about how they work how they might fail what sort of symptoms you might see right this is the common stuff that i've seen in my career but it's important to note that you could have some really random things causing your car to have no heat say you just got a car and maybe the previous owner completely bypassed the heater core altogether of course that's going to lead to to no heat in your vehicle so a big thanks to advanced auto parts for sponsoring the video of course check out their link in the video description and check out their
