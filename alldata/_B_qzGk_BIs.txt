ladies and gentlemen if you followed Chess at all you're probably familiar with some very big names Magnus Carlsen Hikaru Nakamura maybe you know me Gotham chess maybe you follow Gary Kasparov former world champion and arguably the goat well guess what there's a new player all of you should know and his name is Frank mostly plays chess in short form content Frank is rated literally 100 ELO in Blitz I recently covered one of Frank's matches and the full video was uploaded to my second Channel Gotham Clips it didn't go too well for Frank but he's very funny and he's British and he yells the word cheeky a lot well in today's video I'm going to show you the results of my first chess lesson with Frank I gave Frank a chess lesson in a twitch stream a couple of days ago let me know in the comments if you want me to upload the entire thing and I'm gonna show you how Frank has ascended as a chess player after just one lesson not only did he Ascend as a chess player he took on his arch nemesis in a rematch and won the game with a shockingly high accuracy score this is the before this is how Frank played chess before we did a lesson he played 85 and by the way you know this is gonna be a funny video but you're actually going to learn a lot so I don't know if that's your objective but you're gonna learn a lot Frank used to always bring out his Queen all right you see Frank Frank uh Frank's like a lot of beginners he knows that the queen is a is a high value piece and he was bringing it out very early in the game trying to deliver mates the problem is against the good player in the in this case orbital racer who's quite a good chess player I have to tell you very very Advanced beginner um was doing quite well even though he wasn't always playing the best moves D4 Frank was capturing and you see his opponent was playing principal chess two Pawns in the center castling early Frank was still moving his Knights out to the edge of the board all right Knight C6 was all right but if you let Frank loose in the middle game it would be game over as you can already see he's obtained a death a dead lost position in eight moves so his opponent played Bishop E3 he defended and what a lot of beginners do when they're sort of left unattended is what a toddler would do is if they were left unattended they would fall into a swimming pool face first and probably drown or walk off a cliff or shove a fork into an outlet or or pull down a gigantic mirror at a department store on themselves so Frank plays B5 losing a pawn orbital captures and after the move knight uh after the move Bishop A4 uh Frank hangs the Knight so Frank doesn't Castle he just hangs the knight in one move and when orbital plays Knight to D5 instead throwing in an attack on his Queen Frank rotates his Queen to a square it can be captured proceeds to lose basically all of his pieces and get brutally checkmated on the back rank this is how Frank played chess before he met yours truly I gave him one chess lesson and then he challenged somebody who beat him in a match ten to one you see Frank played a blitz match against orbital racer because they have pretty big followings in the short form content world uh for the people who are a bit older and don't follow Tick-Tock don't follow much of YouTube shorts there's a whole audience out there of young chess players and just young people in in general who got into chess via this kind of more goofy chess uh area now when I covered this match Frank orbital racer I had 20 000 live viewers that's insane there are many Grand Masters in the world that have never had 20 000 people to watch their match live this is the result of Frank doing a chess lesson with me and taking his chest a little more seriously first of all notice it's a 10 minute game so his rating in Rapid is actually 400 it's not 100. now Frank is a principled man and he puts two knights in the center like like he's supposed to this is exactly how you're supposed to play a chess game now his opponent actually loses the pawn on E5 which is a very very common beginner mistake for for some reason beginners just sort of like arbitrarily develop pieces but don't realize why they're doing it like they just think oh Pawn in the center Knights Bishops I have to Castle they don't realize that pieces are interacting so Knight takes Pawn is actually something we will add to Frank's toolbox that's just the free part now Frank got into the habit of playing D3 because I told Frankie you gotta put two Pawns in the center if possible uh but you know now he's blocking in his Bishop so this is something that we're gonna have to correct you don't want to block either of your Bishops so the light squared Bishop should come out and then you should play uh the teapot now black already can start taking advantage here he can play a move like Knight to G4 he doesn't do that he plays D6 and Frank trades off the Bishops okay I don't hate this all right I do not hate this at all but again if you have an opportunity you need to play Bishop E2 and castle like you should try to get castled and then two Pawns in the center but Frank is a good student so Frank knows two Pawns in the center like Gotham told me I gotta put two Pawns in the center let's do it his opponent obliges and Frank now maybe a couple of weeks ago would have played Knight to G5 and hung his Queen would have played E5 E5 is not a good move because your king is still in the center you don't want to open up that position you do not want to open up the center of the board if your king is still in the center in this position Frank plays Bishop to D3 and castles this is big boy stuff this is big boy stuff by Frank the Tank Woodley alright canceling and now white as far as I'm concerned is better I know the computer says black is better uh I like White's position because white has more Center space and when the Knight moves white is gonna happen to open open file now keep in mind this is a man Frank is playing a person that beat him 10-1 imagine playing a friend and they beat you 10 out of 11 games you're obviously going to be psychologically rattled watch how Frank ascends in this game C5 played by black and Frank here locks the center with D5 not a bad move now the computer wants him to now play E5 because uh if Pawn captures there is just Pawn captures and pressure on the Knight but I don't hate this move at all his opponent finishes development and in this position there's a clip I actually uploaded it today where I was yelling that if Frank has any future in chess it's to play the move H3 why because sometimes in chess you just can't do too much you just can't do too much like in every position in chess you have to look for checks captures attacks in this position white has none of those white has no checks white has no captures and white has nothing they can attack because if they go here there's E5 so well I mean except H3 but you have to think of a way to improve your positions how do you improve your position either pawns or pieces well I would maybe consider Queen D2 and something like this or maybe with pawns I love H3 I don't love the next move but for this level I it's fine G4 you don't really want to push Pawns in front of your king but in this case I don't mind we're running the black piece this is out of town the reason why these pieces these pawn moves are not that great is because they're overextending and Frank does not realize three pieces are actually staring at that now as you improve as a beginner you're gonna get better at drawing mental arrows that your opponent's pieces have as well like all my opponent's pieces are all targeting the E4 Pawn maybe I shouldn't you know maybe I shouldn't induce more attacks on my E4 Pawn uh but that's okay and uh actually orbital goes here now here things start to get a little dicey all right and in every chess game you're going to be winning and you're going to be losing okay maybe you're not always going to be winning but you're probably going to be losing uh Frank plays the move Knight H4 all right this is already the beginning of the end Frank is slipping up once again overextending this Knight used to guard that pawn and the Knight went here and relinquished defense of that pawn and now black immediately swoops in Queen takes G5 and Frank is on the ropes Frank once again will succumb to the pressure of his opponent much like Israel arasanya versus Alex pajera but Frank sees that after the check and the attack on the night he can drop his Knight back in this position orbital racer plays Knight to E5 moving forward like The Terminator absolutely unafraid of anything Frank now plays Knight B5 looking to create a little bit of counter play on the position and orbital racer makes a mistake he spent a little bit of time he played Knight F4 he thought that's it I'm moving in for the kill and he blundered and Frank played the move Knight to B5 with the intention of Landing a fork or a capture of a pawn his opponent went here and a lot of beginners would see the attack on the night and try to defend it or they would just miss that that's a threat at all because they're 400. Frank thinks and takes the knight in 20 seconds oh my oh my oh my oh my he's taken the night now at this level of Chess being up at night means literally nothing when I say literally nothing I mean literally nothing it's not the first mistaken chess that kills you the best analogy I can give to you comes from a book I read called art of learning imagine you are crossing the street some of you live in a town of 500 people you never have to worry about this it's all horses you live in a town where no cars have been invented yet but I live in New York City and imagine you're crossing the street and you nearly get hit by a car now what can you do you can either go oh my gosh I'm caught in the middle of the intersection let me get across or you can yell at the driver you can yell at the driver for nearly hitting you and get actually hit by a car the second mistake is what kills you in chess the first mistake is Knight F4 and you go oh my god what have I done all right but it's the second mistake when you cannot refocus yourself you cannot compose yourself and in this position orbital trades Bishops which is a knight for Bishop you should not trade when you're losing and then the Haymaker from the heavens A6 and he completely misses Knight to C7 it's not the first mistake that kills you it's the second and even the third and Frank is up a full Rook oh my goodness against his arch nemesis a man who defeated him ten to one now how do you win a winning position in chess how do you know you're winning material you're up a rook how do you capitalize on this you need to bring your material into the game you need to make it felt you need to use your material your pawns here build a fence for your position repelling the enemy forces from infiltration trade the Queens bring in The Rook trade a few pawns on this side of the board Frank immediately blunders immediately blunders giving up not just a pawn but also allowing the black Rook into the game a moments ago the black Rook was staring into nothing now it's staring into everything and Frank now plays Rook G4 I don't hate this move but he's got to activate his rook in the corner of the board we have Queen to F5 Knight to H4 and Frank grabs the bishop I love this move now black is down to a rook and a queen versus a queen and a rook and another Rook now what do you do here with white don't even hesitate bring the queen or bring the queen up and bring the Rook over you need to use the material I hate Frank's next move and you'll notice look at Frank's time management down to 5 30. down to 4 30. he's down two and a half minutes on the clock I am nervous watching this game the move H4 has destabilized the move Rook G4 now what I would have wanted to see here from orbital when you're down a rook is you want to take as many pawns as you want you don't want to make too many trades and G5 is a massive mistake why is it a massive mistake because you're trading Rooks this is not what you want this is not what you want because now you only have a queen you needed a little bit more Firepower however Frank is in a very bad spot because orbital has now won three pawns for a rook that's three to five that's only a two-point material advantage and I got bad news for you this Rook still has not moved and I got even worse news for you if Frank plays Queen to E2 he's no longer even better he's lost because it took him so long to activate his Rook the King on the back rank is completely weak here the chess God smiled upon Frank as he completely unknowingly played a fantastic move which is Queen to G4 Frank in no way shape or form saw that this was an idea and that he was going to block I would bet some hundreds of dollars on it but neither did his opponent Queen takes D3 would have given black four pawns for The Rook but black is still lost because the Rook will gobble everything black went here now I love Frank's next move he does not get distracted Here Comes The Rook this is a hero move from Mr Frank Rook to E1 is a brilliancy in and of itself because he's activating his Rook Pawn to G6 Rook down to eh check now the only thing you need to be careful about here on a board with your king so open is long diagonal checks your king needs to be safe from checks or at least your king needs to be saved from checks that are going to Fork the king in The Rook your rook and queen always need to work together in this position Pawn takes C4 played and now Frank needs to play Queen E4 he needs to connect the queen and the Rook so he never has any problems he plays B4 I don't like this move he gets poissanted in his own words now a takes B3 Queen B3 white no longer has any pawns on the board he can only give checks and Frank after some long thought finds Queen to D4 he spent 38 seconds that was the only check that he had and he lands at Queen D4 check now F6 on the board and here Frank needs to find rookie seven why does he need to find rookie seven because if the King goes out here it's mate if the King goes out here it's mate the only move here that does not get mated with Queen takes Pawn is King G8 and this is still going to be Checkmate in a few moves and you'll notice the queen guards the rook and both of these pieces can come back at any time time to guard The King The King could also probably end up running but after F6 Queen takes D6 happened with two minutes on the clock Frank's time is running out in this position black has a check that hits both the king and the rook and I got news for you if this move had happened I think Frank would have seen the check and he would have ran coming back to defend yourself is a miracle move here for white I mean if black had found Queen B5 I am not certain at all that this game would have been uh would have what would have been a win for white instead black played A5 and the game is over Frank now like a white like a like a knight on a beautiful white horse after Queen takes D6 gallops into the black position and lands the Fatal knockout punch there is Queen to a cheat mate just Follow the yellow brick road or there is Rook back to E7 and the black king cannot escape the black king no longer has a single legal move he is hanging on the edge of a cliff One Touch of a finger of a pinky if you will will land the King on the opposite side of the cliff and Frank takes the pawn Frank spent 23 seconds he did not find Queen h8 he did not find rookie seven he took on F6 now Queen to B5 check still attacks both of these things but now Rook to h8 and queen to h8 and Rook to E7 are all still possible and I have news for you black didn't stop any of those moves black did not stop any of those moves queens of the corner Rook to the corner are both mate by accident give a check it's made by accident every single move in this position for white should be a check you are that close to the enemy King with two absolutely massive pieces of artillery both of those moves both of those pieces should be giving a check not only does Frank not give a check he also throws the game away not only does he not give a check black now doesn't have Queen B5 because that would actually hang a queen black has the unbelievable Queen to F7 the Thor hammer from the heavens would have won The Rook here for black queen back to F7 would have been a an account deleting move if your opponent plays Queen F7 here you delete your account but the third time is the charm you see Frank had made in one then he had made in one again but sometimes the chest Gods give you one more chance to prove yourself and in this position Frank played Queen to E7 King to H6 The Rook to the corner is now mate once again by accident Rook to hate his mate but you know what they say when you have Maiden one for the fourth time look for something better Queen to H4 check now Frank finds Queen to the corner and the queen has completed her journey Queen to G8 wins the queen but this this is mate in one Frank the tank which has
