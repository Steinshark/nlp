all right so I came across this thing on Reddit where apparently some OSS project is holding its users hostage at least that's how it's described in the issue linked right here and so a little surprising but um this is the headlining does I think it's called mock in its latest version extract and send my email to the cloud via sponsor link question mark so I've just updated mock uh github's mockbox in one of our projects and got a warning after a rebuild about me not having installed a GitHub sponsor app after a bit of Investigation it looks like mock starting from version 4.20 how could you spoil that version okay the crime committed here is already so much worse than I realized like how could you do that how could you do that on that does uh let's see does include a.net analyzer that scans your local git config and on build gets your email address and sends it to some service hosted as you are to check whether or not you are a sponsor this blog post has some more details oh we're gonna read it this is a bit scary and I've read much about such supply chain attack vectors in the past but just updating a project and suddenly noticing a data extraction was unexpected are there any opinions on sponsor link yet is that something dangerous or am I missing something here okay so let's check out his before we look out before we go down into the comments let's go read that blog post let's go read that blog post all right sponsor link trying something newish for OSS sustainability okay so I get this this makes sense um for anyone that's ever done open source knows for a fact that open source is perhaps the worst way to make money uh I think you could make more money on only fans in general than open source uh and probably less work uh open source sustainability is a tricky topic I would kindly refer you to the thoughtful post by Eric sink and six okay yeah yeah suffice it to say we all struggle to make sustainable propositions where we can dedicate full time to the projects we love also there doesn't seem to be a perfect answer for all scenarios so there's always pros and cons okay so hold on this is all this one introducing sponsor link uh I believe most fellow developers don't have an issue with giving away a buck or two a month for a project they enjoy using and delivers actual value and I'm quite positive that a couple dollars a month is an affordable proposition for an Argentinian uh it surely isn't crazy thing to pretty much anyone okay so we're kind of looking at his expectations here his expectations as everybody won't have a problem with this I am a firm believer that supporting your fellow developers is the best thing done personally having your company pay for software surely doesn't feel quite as rewarding as pay from your own pocket feel the reward man and it surely feels uh different for me too we really don't need uh to expense our employers for a couple bucks a month right that's why that's why Netflix doesn't pay for my Netflix subscription the goal of sponsor leak is to connect in the most direct way possible Your sponsorship with your library author sponsor account and since the place where you spend most of the time enjoying your fellow developers open source projects is in an IDE Visual Studio or writer classic those are the two options if you're wondering uh I figured that that's the first place you should uh where you should be reminded that either okay you're an awesome backer and the project is alive and well thanks to you okay thank you for supporting uh sponsorable lib With Your sponsorship of uh of developed wait what a developed developed oh a devloop you're a true hero there we go okay sorry I read that all wrong thank you for uh supporting sponsor sponsorable lib With Your sponsorship of devloop okay ah look at that you get some nice errors okay so then there's a bunch of stuff about how it works blah blah blah blah uh apparently it goes like this if let's see initially let's say I build sponsor link for.net uh via the new git package um okay if a user isn't using an editor or there is no network there's nothing to do so bail quickly a library author runs git config get user email during a build to get the current user's config email there's no git or email there's nothing to do a quick just a quick snappy head operation to send to Azure blob storage uh to a relative URL ending an apps user email if at 404s that means the user hasn't installed the sponsor link GitHub app okay If the previous check succeeds a second quick operations Speedy is sent to Azure blob storage uh to send URL ending sponsor account user email if at 404 that means that your user isn't sponsoring uh isn't sponsoring the given account oh my goodness bit of quick head right here I'm not gonna lie to you like I'm all for sponsoring people on GitHub I have all four getting these things done I'm all for all of this I love the idea of trying to remind people because I'm sure most people would do it out of like like realizing like if you were to walk up to anybody and be like hey you really like this little thing I don't know uh Echo by forego Lang servers and you're like yeah I really like that would you sponsor that for like a dollar could you give us a dollar a month I don't think I think most developers would be like can I give you a dollar a month yeah sure I could do that no problem but this this ain't it I can tell you right away that this ain't it right like what is happening here is crazy this is crazy I mean first off first off they assume you're using vs code or Rider okay already I mean I'm I am deeply offended okay uh second off you just wrote malware this is this feels like supply chain attack like the person said okay so a little while there I didn't know about that and then on top of it there's this right here which is sponsor link and supporting OSS more broadly so this is from mock right trying to aggregate the various issues into one uh to collect feedback I invite everyone to read the sponsorship link announcement okay so that must have been the one I just read which is this one yeah that's the exact same one okay and to understand the intention behind it no nefarious purpose I promise uh with that in mind I'm obviously open to suggestions to help achieve both your goals and Minds note 420 removes sponsor links as it breaks Mac OS and Linux restore I'll take the opportunity to collect more feedback okay uh the uh okay okay thoughtful blog post here so we're gonna do uh so obviously there's some sort of blog post here for that we'll look at that my two main issues you're collecting the email addresses even though you say you only send hashes you send those hashes to your infrastructure we don't know what you do with these you could store these hashes we can't verify it's your infrastructure and at some point uh compare these hashes to hashes you or someone else with ax uh access to the email address hashes collected from somewhere else as a non-evil example you could use this list to give authority to issues created in this repo based on if they hashed public email of the GitHub user matches the a user on your sponsor list or on your non-sponsor list since you could save whether or not a given hash yeah oh man yeah and you could uh also start building out your user info list with other information you can gather from GitHub users this is not a Justified use of the email address we configure on our local machine so for another example any employer in Europe would also be forced to move away from mock yeah I was about to say this sounds like a mass this sounds like a like immediate Europe up the blackout man confessed to malware sponsor link is obfuscated and closed Source it connects remotely to your infrastructure yes there you go that is also really that also just that's weird to me right you should if you're gonna do this at least put it out in the open for people to read so they feel at least somewhat better with it if you expect your open source project to make money you are making a mistake fact you were someone uh you or some external entity could modify sponsor link and or your private infrastructure with malicious intent and we would not have an easy way of verifying the changes made well even if that okay let's say there is an open source version of sponsor link that doesn't actually mean that whatever's being built or sent to or anything is actually what's being used as the open source version react has their open source front and then there's like a whole thing on the other side that they do right so that like even to remotely say that open source fixes these problems they don't it's basically a supply chain malware in the making it doesn't matter that it only runs on developer machines at the moment either because there's tons of developers who publish from visual Studios and yes the horror but not only that but I mean this really just made a great example of some weird supply chain things you can do kind of wild right uh I know another uh evil OSS project that is holding me hostage I have them open I could not Escape yep classic okay so it sounds like what it really it sounds like is this guy has this great idea I'm sure there's another reading I swear there has to be another reading um somewhere else a deep dive into sponsor link implications for open source and privacy two minutes what okay uh where's the Deep dive it's that's this doesn't look deep dive this looks like little little dive but maybe it's like you know really condensed thoughts in the world of Open Source software there's a balance between creating freely available tools and finding a way to sustain the hard work that goes into developing them one recent Solution that's getting interaction is sponsor link introduced it where's it gaining this traction from and who's doing this introduced with the aim of promoting this uh the sponsorship of Open Source projects specifically with popular.net testing Library Mock and it's 4.20 version is is is this actually gaining traction or is this just a singular large Library uh what is sponsor Link in essence sponsor link was created by Daniel cusolina oh man poor guy AKA kazoo the creator of mock in an initiative to encourage developers to financially support their fellow developers who produce a valuable open source tools by embedding sponsor Link in a library developers can send gentle reminders to their users about the possibility of sponsorship straight within the development environment like Visual Studio or Rider okay Real Talk how would you feel how would you feel if your IDE reminded you all right let's just say let's just say that there's no sponsor link right there's none of this crap that reads your emails or validates any of those things but instead once a month vs code neovim whatever goes hey by the way don't forget to sponsor your open source projects here's a list of ones that you could sponsor right it doesn't take your email it doesn't do any of that you mean Sublime Sublime is not sponsorship Sublime is asking if you would please pay for the product and you say no every time reminders uh no different from suck these nuts uh I got a fun story about that here in just a moment uh I'd like to get that warning and uh when I finally get a credit card and you're old enough okay you're a young guy uh I'm okay with it actually npm fund kind of like npm fun but who looks at npm install afterwards come on 16 packages need in this 16 packages are looking for funding you're like yeah got em yeah what does it mean to have daily averages who's collecting that information all of a sudden this uh you know all of a sudden this became a lot more kind of terrifyingly who's collecting this information how much information does visual studio or Rider collect for someone to know that they're using a package what does it mean to use it's from nougat so is nougat tracking how are you using things oh no no downloads I get downloads you can track because it's a request to your server if that's not what I'm saying that's totally reasonable it's 103 daily oh average daily Oh I thought that was uses sorry my bad okay that's just that's just downloading okay downloading I can understand because I mean you have stats about every URL that's probably visited so you can kind of get it okay okay it's just download it's just downloads not usage okay okay um sorry um yeah that's generally how I feel you know I I feel bad for this guy obviously a hundred and some thousand downloads a day a very very popular open source Library Millions upon millions of uses usages all that kind of stuff and yet at the end of the day you're not making really a dime from anything does that feel bad I I mean I understand that you feel bad about that but you know like I hate to also be the the  Here I Am the in this situation but you gotta get over yourself right like if you're gonna go OSS like you should just like you should just realize you are getting nothing you are getting nothing from doing oss the reason you should do OSS is because you are getting nothing and you're just improving people's lives right if you think that you should get paid massively from OSS work I'm sorry right I'm sorry that you feel that way but the reality disagrees with you thoroughly okay like you know because at the end of the day that's just not how it works now TJ TJ in this chat he works on neovim and he's and he does a lot of stuff with me of him by the way TJ if you want to jump in and give me like a little what's what about all this stuff I'd love to hear kind of your perspective on this uh because you know I may have a bad perspective here like I I've encouraged and said it would be a great idea front and Masters gave stuff to neovim I think they gave a hundred grand or something like that to any of him I can't remember if TJ knows the number that'd be great there's like uh what is it open Collective um uh uh yeah I mean they they give out like I think that this is I personally think this is one of the ways that you should be giving out which is that you give out via this you know like I love when I see companies doing it because companies are the ones that actually use all this stuff right they're the ones that actually do things okay they only gave Seven Grand I forgot how much they gave my bad I must have mixed up this number with that number but they still they they still gave a month worth of full-time work to pay somebody to do great stuff right um you know like to me this seems like this is the real viable way is having companies that can pay for this right uh to me that seems like the most viable way to have it happen but again I don't think anyone on neovim is sitting there waiting for a paycheck right does Netflix give back to OSS go ahead go look at our OSS we have we have so much OSS giving back we literally we literally hold the free BSD uh we make it work all right hold on TJ hold the yellow uh hold on uh let me let me just get you up here can you talk again just so I can make sure you're in the Stream hello testing one two three I'm gonna make you a little bit louder there we go do it again nice what's up chat all right I think you should be about good now all right uh let me get you in here because you you obviously work on neovim you have a much different perspective for me most likely um I mean you're kind of an open source guy didn't you do like Falco or something that's got a lot of stars on GitHub TJ remember when we used to be friends see you guys it was nice knowing you I guess this is promo in this chat remember when we used to you know I used to love you and I thought you're a great guy remember when I got really great rates for my advertising just memes and then now this I've made a terrible error you have um all right there we go but I mean okay so so like mice I'll I'll give my quick like this is what I've done with open source um you know my my small time doing open source I mean involved just you know 20 hours a week just answering just questions stack Overflow started getting questions that was kind of a basic expectation was me to find those things and start like bringing them up it was just Wild by the way you just got your your band removed on uh yeah so there you go ban me here you can't ban him out of this chat uh so so here's the question I guess oh hold on can I bend you this way what did you just mute me or something no I haven't muted you I don't uh yeah get out get out of here DJ uh all right um oh wait I just wait oh you're back all right so okay nice can you just tell us a little bit about your open source experience and all that come over here baby yeah yeah so I mean I guess like a lot of you probably know me from doing uh neovim stuff that was the first project that I ever did any open source work four um and then like over the years I've built a lot of features for neovim and then got out of neovim core and then I've also done several sort of like other plugins or contributed to various other plugins most notably creating telescope I guess yeah it'll still work at a company that is like well you wouldn't necessarily say like open it depends on your definition of Open Source right as in like Source graph is Source available right but like we don't it's not false like it's not free and open source but yeah um so what's your most notable feature you've done for neovim something that I would recognize uh the LSP I wrote a lot of that all right there you go if for those that are not familiar with LSPs that's what makes your that's what makes or if you like Lua like I did a lot of the Lua Integrations not like the first embedding but like turning different Vim features on in Lua yep okay basically like Auto commands or like being able to pass functions back and forth between vimscript and the event things like that I remember watching you do uh the auto commands and you're getting pronounced by C uh with a stack allocated buffer and being like why is it changing like a little stack allocations baby yeah it was in a loop with uh some old macros and some other stuff happening and you could not find out where things were there was a lot of global State and Magic happening but yeah we felt that for you you could put yeah it was it was a good time it was a lot of I learned a lot of stuff from it so that was good yeah because I didn't make a lot of money on it that's right how many dollars did you make on doing LSP oh for LSP zero so much like the the library LSP zero you were also at lsb0 yet it represents how much money I made oh I think the only I've been paid twice for any of them one was for um I think when we did uh like some stuff with Diagnostics like the second time around uh but actually both times were after I had my baby and I had uh well separate kids right and like I had a month off and we only pay people to work on neovim for like neovim core stuff if you can do a whole month full-time basically like it just makes it a lot simpler to manage because we don't have enough money to just pay people to do stuff all the time right so it's basically like that was the I I did some a bunch of stuff for Diagnostics and then I did uh vim9jit as like an exploratory project to see if we could uh translate them ninescript into Lua that could run inside in the oven uh pretty far with the the uh Vim script nine it's like it's currently that's correct there's currently Lua code in any of them that's on your computer right now that was translated by it so yeah it works awesome awesome um okay so what's your opinion on this whole debacle with sponsor link uh yeah before we can first start off I guess maybe with uh well can I here I'll give you I'll give you my like I'll give you my hottest take about it that I think is just funny which is basically like you're already using.net and you care that someone has your email address like I think you're just barking up the wrong tree I it's just for like am I chat am I wrong okay I'm not saying it was good or he did the right thing but who charge here using a Microsoft products on a Microsoft platforming like they're taking our information I've got my email address do they know what they can do with them you've already put the microchip in your brain you know like you're worried about some random guy having your email address so that was pretty good one okay that that's a pretty fun one uh all right it is there is a slight bit of irony there with Microsoft like so thoroughly getting as much information always pushing that envelope uh yeah from you by the way Microsoft did I don't know if you know this but they have started like an ads department they are running ads they have their own ads aggregator all that kind of stuff so trust me they're not doing all this kind stuff for free they've been collecting data for the last five years and they've been uh piloting out their ads program for a little while um yeah anyways because they want to overtake what Google's doing uh and still be useful activity anyways uh so besides for that that's sort of like the first the first part where I just sort of see like sometimes I feel that there's like an outrage bandwagon right where it's like oh this guy did something stupid it's pretty stupid to crawl people's computers for personal info and then upload it right like that's that does seem stupid yeah like it's not the method that I would I would do although it would be cool if you know like GitHub or some of these other places that are particularly like I get like why patreon wouldn't have like a nougat package to check if somebody's a sponsor but like uh like why like if you're a GitHub sponsor some easy way to check whether people are so you could give them additional features or things like that like where you could register that you want to be able to do that right some some other way where you're like actively taking a step say like Oh I wanna I wanna make it so that people can know that I'm their sponsor here's the account that would be associated with that or like my company account or something like that those things seem like it would be cool and good in ways that people could provide you know better uh monetization like strategies for developers so one one suggestion that I saw is like a really easy way to get you know like private nougat packages right where you get like a pre-release you get to test it early provide feedback you know like things that are worth money that cost time you know um but so yes and I also think putting stuff into people's builds is a bad strategy and also I don't think you saw it but I'm pretty sure if you weren't a sponsor added like a second of build time I don't think you saw that all right but I I didn't go through the comments yet uh on this and so it must be on the comment side but that's uh there's like literally a thread.sleep I'm sure if you like search thread.sleep on one of these it's like yeah oh no first it had a punishment if you're not a sponsor you get slow builds yes that was my that was my understanding which I think is like it's it's not a it's just not like regardless of like the ethics of a bunch of the stuff it is it I made okay so I'll take a step back it probably shouldn't be surprising because the thing that people don't get is like making a popular open source library has literally no overlapping required skills often times of like being a smart marketer and knowing how to deal with people yeah those are like two parts a great example harpoon's a great example I've never made that cool plug-in must be an idiot though never see him make any progress on the on the plugin anymore um so so I just sort of sometimes think like people sort of assume that you know this guy has the same like level of lawyers as like Microsoft and is trying to like outwit you at every turn and collect all your data to harvest and he's just like dude it seems like git keeps your email what if we like use that to see if you're a GitHub sponsor you know like that seems more likely to me than he's trying to be like yes I'm gonna Harvest all your info and then sell it to the highest bidder that's kind of my take when I read his sponsorship link like when you read it it's so like upbeat and like oh yeah dude guess what we're gonna we're gonna finally get people you don't mind spending a dollar and I know you don't and he's right people don't real like I don't if if some project that I was using was like hey can you give us a couple dollars it'd be really it'd be really useful right like or if you're like an officially recommended project by Microsoft in their docs in Microsoft's never paid you a penny which is my understanding um I think I can find I had I love that one yeah well so I think he said um you have a massive viewers are based in massive companies like as he's quoting somebody says you know how many of those Master use of braces are sponsored by Merc and those massive companies never heard of them only AWS contributed once and people in the thread literally like saying uh at times you may feel like everyone's benefiting from you and you don't get anything in return for it this is true but remember you have benefited from your work by building a name for yourself which might open up new opportunities literal paid and exposure is people's like is people's response like dude you're getting paid in exposure which uh I of course agree with Judo that if you think you're going to make a bunch of money from officers you're probably not going to so it's a bad strategy to try and do but like the consumers of it in this world are like dude you've gotten you've got opportunities for it you know and uh I'm gonna play The Devil's Advocate Advocate with the users do you think the best thing you should expect from open source is exposure I'm gonna throw that out probably the best thing that you should expect but that doesn't mean that like it feels like a good trick it doesn't it's not it's not a good trade so if you go into it with the expectation like I will only get street cred from doing this at least you're not disappointed at the end of the day because you will get Street Credit unfortunately this poor fella kzu is definitely got even extra street cred after this move yeah filled so basically like you know what people should realize is you should expect to make like less money than you do working like minimum wage somewhere like I could make more money working at Taco Bell down the street and save a bunch of extra money every month by probably getting free food there instead of having to pay for it it would be like kind of a double win then I'd probably make way more money in that than I have in open source but um but that doesn't mean that it feels good especially when you know like Microsoft puts you in the recommended stuff for the language that they make then you're like at no point along the line you feel like you know any sort of spot so that's where I I get like what it's what it feels like which is really it can feel very uh crummy in that situation yeah all right Mr Leo over here said companies should be required to sponsor OSS what do you think about that as somebody who probably would benefit off this rule right if there was this rule you would probably directly benefit off of it uh well like required by what like ethically or by by like let's just say the United States government says from here on out any company that resides in the United States must pay money to use open source oh heck yeah cause I'm gonna start making I'm gonna start name squatting on Rust crates and I'm about to make so much money there's no perverse incentive so I'm just gonna make sure that I make rust crates that depend on other rust crates that I own and I'm gonna have 95 of your dependencies are from me get wrecked yeah it's gonna be tax dollars every single function you've ever written would immediately become its own rust crate yeah this rust crate does depend on 9 000 different rust crates I'm just saying I'm really bit like but it's nice you can tell because it has 9 000 dependents they're all me though yeah I mean obviously there's there's obviously anytime you put like a requirement like that you put a perverse incentive in place as well right so I think I think that that like I'm not I'm not a big fan of trying to like require companies to do it I think you can like help influence that by encouraging your company to give some amount so like at various times like Source graph uh has given money to neovim because we also pay for like um jet brains like subscriptions for people so it's kind of like that's just fair right so if it's like we can say oh we are allocating money for editors why not like allocate some money for some of the free and like open editors that people are using as well so that seems that part that seems like an easy win you could get you could get into right and you'd be surprised like if you know one percent of devs like convince their companies that uh trying to set something up like that even for just like one-time things and stuff uh that's actually a lot of like money for a project generally you know what I'm saying so there's so there's some cool stuff I think like in that space But that's harder for things like dependencies and stuff you know like you you maintain some thankless dependency that's you know like eight dependencies deep you're you're the only one writing the you know like HTTP crate or something like that you know what I mean and it's like Flawless and everybody uses it I it's it's difficult to figure out how you can get sponsorship to those kinds of people I think finding other ways like um support contracts or or or you know like I mentioned maybe private uh repos that get sort of pre-releases or being able to like only people who are sponsors are allowed to make issues you know like I don't know there's like a lot of stuff you could do that like answering issues isn't Fun and people who don't pay for anything generally don't make good quality issues comparatively yep you'd assume more skin in the game when you are paying for something right so then so there's just like a lot of you you make your job a lot more fun as a maintainer because people who like actually pay like make that happen and then yeah so I think there there are various ways that you can try and monetize some of it um especially like as your project gets uh bigger and you're like wow actually like people are getting a lot of value for this can we find a way that we can exchange value right which I think is like a good uh good sort of way to think about that um yeah all right um so I actually think so me personally I think one of the best ways company gives back is this right here uh a lot this has happened many times throughout my time at Netflix even to me and to other people is that you find a library you really like and you give actual engineering hours because those are the most expensive um yeah to me this just seems like one of the best ways is to have like corporate sponsors in work make the library better answering issues becoming an active Community member and that's kind of an expectation I like this one I think I always will like that one uh but I mean kind of going back to like what is most used and kind of talking about what you're doing look at this so weekly downloads for react 20.6 million weekly downloads for uh is even 2060. so we're talking about uh one thousandth do you think that is even is one thousandth as worthy for money as as react I think it's 10 times more I think I get a lot more value out of his even than I would from react facts but I mean like just just facts but like just think about it for a second right left pad I will go we'll go with left patch do you think that every uh where's the proper one right well that's so that's basically why I think like any strategy that you try and do like algorithmically yeah tends to lead to really bad percentage uh or like incentives just like any incentive that you have you know at your work generally for like just a straight metric that affects people's pay is like a bad strategy oh lines of code added okay well now people write lots of code oh lines of code deleted okay well now you know like like all these number of commits per day number of issue right whatever one you're gonna pick they enter like people will just adjust their behavior so that it benefits them which is like of course what's gonna happen right so if you say oh it's number of issues is is like a demotor to your thing QA will just bundle all your issues into one thing for you you know or something like that or like you'll just bundle eight things into one issue yeah and then say like see I only made one bug even though it's 30 bucks you know like or or like if it's tickets closed then you make a crap ton of tiny tickets and then you complete all those um if what you're interested in is gaming the system instead of just like doing a good job right so that's yeah that's always the danger of this thing which is what will happen no matter how you feel about it that is the inevitable outcome and I've seen it over and over again at Netflix at one point docs became a very important kind of way of engineering and all of a sudden there's nine million docs about every decision being made and it becomes the impossible sifting through things to find out what actually is happening because one doc has six docs going off of it and each dock has its owners and you know like it becomes a street cred like when whenever you incentivize something as some way to relate your importance that ends up happening whether you like it or not and just kind of taking this little left Pat this is odd is even they are sister packages and one of them does depend on the other and I forget but uh this one right here has 262 the other one has 400 and something so like 600 something so like for every dollar react should deserve in funding under some sort of uniform algorithmic principle is even an is odd would receive point three cents that doesn't seem fair to me react as is largely more useful despite how we feel about it and it just it's like ridiculous that that is that's a real thing right and so it just feels funny that that's like you can't solve it that way yeah so that's kind of the thing where it feels like it's very difficult to have some algorithmic solution or some top-down approach instead I think a better strategy is like you personally can go to your company and try and have them pay for things that give them value or you can personally do that um as well yeah uh especially I was thinking was sponsored like he thought you wouldn't care give a dollar give right yeah what would be cool is like I think there are other options too you know like oh I want to give ten dollars a month and a git split between the things that I use right and like maybe you know GitHub or somebody else could facilitate those kinds of things that would be really good I think that that's actually probably the best idea I've ever heard right or or you know you get to put some allocation for some things ahead of time and then you leave you know 50 of it to be distributed evenly between you know your uh just straight up dependencies right you know what I'm saying like oh so I know that I mostly use react and I mostly use you know this or something I mostly use hdmax and I mostly use uh dream right and then like so I'm gonna put those two with 50 and then the rest of them are are fine um it is true that some companies don't know how to expense it or write it off but I think like you should you can just write it you don't have to write it off you can just like expect it as a yeah GitHub has a way for companies to do that now as a separate process as my understanding and it's like in my mind it's just like paying for other software right like yeah so I actually I really do like that idea of GitHub like if you have projects on GitHub you have open source stuff on GitHub you have any repos on GitHub you can just say hey scan my repos for which ones have like weighted by stars waited by whatever right way to buy commits made to it however you want to wait it and yeah I will give a hundred dollars you

and doing no camel instead okay bye chat I love the take bye look at TJ he's trying to exit there we go he exited get him out of here [Music] the name is the OS estrogen
