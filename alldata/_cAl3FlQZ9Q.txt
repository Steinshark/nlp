there it is that's the [Music] sign right I'm 
getting straight to the pitch the new petition   is at mass balls.com please do go there link 
below and sign the petition we want to get a   Wembley Stadium's worth of signatures however 
if you're one of these people who insists on   knowing the details of what you're signing 
fine here's the video I have a plan to fix   this geometric Abomination and it's a new plan 
so if you've watching my channel for a while   you know I have a long running campaign against 
the geometrically inaccurate football on a UK   street sign because that's made of light colored 
hexagons and dark colored hexagons whereas an   actual classic football is made of light colored 
hexagons so far so good and dark colored pentagons   and I cannot overstate this a Pentagon has five 
sides and a hexagon has six sides I've said that   sentence so many times I went on sport TV it I did 
a lot of sport media which I wasn't used to and   this all happened six years ago when I launched a 
campaign to fix the street signs because they are   a national embarrassment this is the biggest 
problem facing Society in the UK and I had a   parliamentary petition because this is department 
for transport they mandate these signs they could   change and I didn't ask to fix fix the old ones 
I just did update the design make it accurate   for all future street signs and if I got over 
10,000 signatures I would get a letter from the   government saying what they were going to do and 
I have an update please do sign the petition we   have such a fantastic community of people who 
watch mathematics videos on YouTube let's put   that to good use together we can change society 
for the better ah past Matt so young and naive   also so hairy and I did get a letter from the 
government and it turns out they said um no they   said they're not going to fix the street signs 
and I won't read the whole thing out it's it's   deeply underwhelming They Don't Really address 
any of my major points about how the geometry is   wrong and how that's sending the wrong signals in 
a country that claims to care about mathematical   education um but I will say one thing here the 
purpose of a tra sign is not to raise public   appreciation and awareness of geometry which is 
better dealt with in other ways so that was the   whole argument and they both say that the detail 
like in a in a fixed sign would be too subtle for   drivers to notice and they say that the correct 
geometry would be and I quote uh so distracting   it would increase the risk of an accident come 
on so I was very upset by that and I felt like   they didn't take me seriously I was like if only 
I could have some kind of insight into what their   decisionmaking process was when they gave me that 
letter but the only way we could do that would be   with a freedom of information request to get all 
the internal emails that pertain we did exactly   that a uh a journalist friend of mine got all I 
mean all the personal information's redacted we   got all the internal Communications that pertain 
to the response I got and uh the consensus is they   said no and it's not an interesting note there's 
absolutely no discussion about if my case had any   merits they they're just like how do we tell this 
guy to go away uh and I'll quote one bit from it   uh the government considers the current football 
symbol conveys a clear meaning understood by the   public changing the design for public appreciation 
of geometry is not the purpose of a traffic sign   I would argue that being geometrically plausible 
is the purpose of a street sign and that's kind   of where we're at if you've seen my Humble Pie 
standup special or read the book uh both of which   are out as we speak I go into a bit more detail 
about the response I got um from the government   and I go through yet again why this sign is so 
offensive now a lot of people during the campaign   did say hey Matt have you considered maybe the 
street signs are just a different football they're   a football that is made of hexagons it's not the 
classic one you think it is well the problem is we   can prove mathematically you cannot make a ball 
entirely out of hexagons we don't know how many   hexans we don't know how they were arranged but 
we do know for a fact that if you take n subtract   3 n add on 2 N you get an answer of zero you 
cannot get two it's absolutely impossible so   there's no way you can have a ball where you get 
value two The Only Exception is you get a value   of zero on a ball if you punch a hole through 
it so we' both closed the door on having an all   hexagen foot ball but we've opened the option 
of an all hexagen foot donut what would that   look like though I made one yeah thanks to the 
kickstarters who made filming Humble Pie a comedy   of Math's errors possible it and my new book love 
triangle the life-changing magic of trigonometry   both available to purchase well you can pre-order 
love triangle please do it's on mass gear. co.uk   and they have more details about my ridiculous 
ongoing campaign and so the conclusion to The Saga   up until now has been if I can't get a ball out 
of hexagon we're going to make a foot donut out of   hexagons and we had a video game where you try and 
bounce a foot donut across the field and then that   was my attempt to kind of bring bring this whole 
Saga to a close but then I had another Revelation   while it's impossible to make a ball entirely out 
of hexagons it is possible to make a ball partly   out of hexagons like you could have hexagons just 
in one area and other shapes somewhere else and   so I realized it would be technically possible 
to make a football such that from one specific   angle it looks like the sign which means I've got 
a whole new Avenue to take this campaign instead   of trying to get the signs changed to match the 
football I could get the football changed to match   the signs but to make a football that looks like 
that from only one angle I need to find someone   who can make custom footballs so I found someone 
who makes custom footballs John Paul makes custom   and often highly geometric footballs you may have 
seen some of their work online I'm a huge fan of   what they do I particularly like the Hat tile 
football they made a while ago but they've done   loads of other ridiculous balls it was an honor 
to be able to drop by and visit John Paul and   their partner Alison and see how they make these 
incredible footballs and a while ago John B got   in touch and said do you want to collaborate on a 
ball and I said oh my goodness I need a football   that looks like the street signs and they got to 
work they used 3D software to try and figure out   how all the shapes could go together and then they 
got stitching they initially made a prototype but   then they made the real deal and I was able to 
go there for the grand unveiling this is it I'm   so excited but I'm curious to know how how did 
you make the impossible like this shouldn't be   this shouldn't exist I I I can I have good prop 
to okay yeah so this is this is a prot verion a   rejected prototype that we use as a stepping stone 
to get to point oh that's really great basic kind   of process was starting with just a standard ball 
yep in 3D software orientating it like in one   specific specific Direction and it was literally 
just a case of having the logo up as a reference   and adjusting the Lin messing around with it 
to sort of create this like you know these wed   panels but it just so happens that yeah it's two 
angles on the ball it looks like it's constructed   from just X and then just a nightmare around yeah 
just don't look at this so the next version kind   of you know try to sort of blend these panels 
together a little bit so combine this one this   one basically made it less of like a half and a 
half and Mel them together which is what we have   here exactly gone um do you do the I do okay we 
have I don't hang on okay I don't want to drop it ining that's so good it hasn't got the same 
equator that's that's very disconcerting viewed   from that angle but there it is that's the sign 
that's the sign that's the sign it's the sign so   how does the impossible ball The Impossible 
ball actually works work which jump all was   constrained by the street sign those hexagons 
have to be where those hexagons are so it looks   like the sign which means it looks nothing like 
an actual football it's got much smaller panels   and seemingly more of them because that's what 
we had to do to make it look like the sign so   it's not going to have your 20 hexagons and your 
12 pentagons a classic football it's going to have   I don't know are those white ones they're going 
to be 20 hexans still maybe more are there 12   more hexagons where the pentagons should be well 
you know what let's count them so in terms of the   number of hexagons we know we have those seven on 
the front there's 1 2 3 4 5 6 seven on the front   we were constrained by the sign they're clearly 
hexagons we can see all of them they have to   be on the ball but the ones around the edge well 
they're a bit more ambiguous so we can use those   to hide the curvature we need to make this a ball 
which you cannot do just using hexagons but we'll   keep counting hexagons for now so around the side 
let's have a look one at the bottom there that's   hexagon number eight up the top there's number 
nine and if we roll right up to the top we've   also got 10 11 12 13 they're all quite classic 
regular hexagons those two middle ones are like   non-regular hexagons uh 14 and 15 they're kind of 
squashed down but that's all the hexagons oh we're   only counting half the ball it is symmetric a bit 
so I'm counting half of it and we'll double them   at the end in terms of other shapes you can see 
see some pentagons now so there's one pentagons   at the top two there we roll back down you may 
have seen a bunch earlier on there's one there   three not a regular pentagon still a pentagon four 
five six seven and eight and of course twice as   many cuz we have the the side as well and that's 
it apart from the Octagon that weird panel in the   middle count them up eight edges that's an octagon 
so that's the whole ball well half of it if we   double them that's the whole ball 30 hexagons 16 
pentagons two octagons way more panels one and a   half half times as many as the classic football 
and it's because we had to have only hexagons   on the front but now we have a big curvature debt 
hence the chaos the absolute Ridiculousness around   the side this is a much more mathematically 
complicated ball it looks far less regular   than the classic one but very importantly it does 
look like the signs just don't look at it from the   side now that we have the ball all we have to do 
is convince the English Premier League that this   is what they should be using Liverpool Football 
Club I mean come on for the American viewers   Liverpool is like one of the top soccer teams in 
the world and here in the UK they're a staple of   the Premier League that's the top League I mean 
they won the whole thing in the 2019 season you   do not get more English football than Liverpool so 
I got in touch and I explained the idea I want to   get this new ball involved and they're like that's 
incredible come on in we'll get some players who   to kind of look at it we've got and I'm like what 
well hang on well I don't want I don't want the   football players I want the football analytics 
team I want your mass nerds and they're like   well yeah sure you can come and see them so we're 
here we can see if this football would work in an   actual game can I get your thoughts now I did 
send you pictures of this before let me get the   right way up yeah ah yeah I mean I I honestly I I 
don't know what to say uh when I first saw this uh   it made me feel a little bit ill little be your 
first words where that makes me feel ill that's   so yeah I mean I'm I'm very sensitive to um uh 
3D geometry and uh yeah I've I've I I was fully   behind your campaign to get the the signs changed 
I was one of the you signed the or signatures   on the on the on the petition um but yeah sadly 
didn't work out but uh yeah this um I mean it's   it's it's it's a work of art but also it brings me 
nightmares it's a very polite way to put it it's a   work art another fun fact Tim was the person who 
designed the foot donut so the foot donut game   was your doing yes for my sins that was that was 
one of my pieces of work uh I I had a lot of fun   putting that together and I bet you did yeah I I 
just tweeted a photo of a foot donut and you went   coded up a game yes I originally met him through 
the foot donut and we' worked together on a few   projects since none of them pertaining to his day 
job so it was nice I got to visit him at Liverpool   and talk about his statistical work and how their 
team gets so much data from so many different   games all around the world every time the football 
is touched within a game we get coordinates on the   pitch the player who uh who makes that touch 
uh and the context around it and we get that   all through the game um for many tens of thousands 
of games from all across the world also it's not   just the Premier League you're getting everything 
no it's uh leagues all the way down to um League   one in the UK um through to South American 
Leagues uh China uh North America all across   Europe um in uh basically any League that you 
can think of we've probably got data for it why   do you need data from so many different games 
what are you trying to do here well basically   our primary role in the research department is 
recruitment so we're trying to see who the next   best player is going to be who we would want to 
sign for Liverpool um so that we can obviously   get the the best result we can in the league 
um and in order to do that we need to look at   games across the whole world so that uh we can 
find all all of those um mysterious players that   nobody else has has spotted yet your data Scouts 
effectively yeah we we work very closely with the   The Scouting Department um because obviously 
they've got their perspective and we can bring   a a sort of slightly different perspective from 
the point of view of of statistics and data and   those two things combined can be really powerful 
and in combination that helps us make much better   decisions when it comes to transferring players 
in and out of the club and I should say Tim has   a new YouTube channel Tim and Cat's greenwalk 
which is all about solar panels solar panels   heat energy around the house yep all that 
stuff y yeah I'll link to a below check it   out of course we showed the ball to the rest of 
the research team we took it to their office and   they had a bit of an impromptu kick around 
everyone thought it was a little bit trippy   watching how the ball changes how it looks 
as it rotates but as you can see definitely   work works as an actual football and while they 
all had their thoughts we thought we'd go right   to the top and speak to the head of the whole 
research Division and I'm just wondering what   are your thoughts so far on this as a football 
um well like a lot of our models from one angle   it works perfectly I feel like I'm getting a lot 
of very carefully worded half insults when uh Tim   described it as art not in a good way I would say 
it's art in a good way oh good good that that's   okay well you know we're going to finally 
we're is all about perspective thank you yes   and my perspective is it's a perfectly bid ball 
I agree well you well I mean as always the proof   is on the pitch yes so we're going to take this 
ball and we're going to actually kick it [Music] around they're able to find me a spare 
Liverpool kit to wear for the kick   around but the closest they could get to my 
initials was DP which stands for Dad perker   it was such a special moment kicking around The 
Impossible on the Liverpool Football Club Premier   League indoor warm-up pitch but the big question 
was of course would the Premier League players   accept this as a new game ball and I asked the 
researchers they said there's no way the players   would ever accept this as a game ball they kick 
the ball so hard and so fast the aerodynamics   make a big difference you can bend the direction 
the ball is going in and this ball is not even   it's not symmetric enough as it's rotating it's 
got well it's got different axes of rotation and   the way you spin it would change how it bends in 
the air which I think would add a new element to   the game apparently no they don't accept that it 
also looks weird as it rotates it looks different   and apparently that would make it very difficult 
to play with which I can confirm obviously pretty   good at football and the only way you can explain 
this is because of the confusing appearance of of   the ball why it's a perfectly legitimate ball 
you can use it for a quick kick around Premier   League players maybe a little upset I think it's 
going to add even more Randomness to the game   and opportunity to exploit the mildly asymmetric 
nature of the ball so I I think we're still a go I   think we still change the ball to match the signs 
I'm not going to send you to one of those petition   sites that Harvest your data I'm going to send you 
to my petition site that will harvest your data so   if you're go to mass balls.com you can sign up 
for the petition and here's what I'm hoping if   enough people sign a petition for the Premier 
League to change to a ball which the players   hate but it's the only way to make the signs make 
sense we now have the Premier League wanting the   government to change the signs as well because 
as we established there's not enough political   will at the moment to change the signs but if 
the Premier League are like look people really   care about this and we want to have to use Matt's 
ridiculous mathematically complicated football the   only way out of this is for the government to fix 
the signs so for that to happen we need you and   tens of thousands of other people please tell 
all your friends to say yes to mathematically   complicated footballs I think if we get more 
than what's Wembley Stadium like 9,000 people   if we get more than a wemble of names signed up 
there'll be a counter on the website malls.com   then I will take the name to the Premier League 
see if we can get this done and if anyone knows   anyone in the government in the department for 
transport come on we surely we can still get   those signs changed huge thanks to John Paul check 
out to pentagons on Tik Tok thanks to Tim check   out there his channel on YouTube linked below and 
thanks to everyone here at Liverpool who let us   come in have a kick around talk about some day 
TR analytics and this fantastic asymmetric ball
