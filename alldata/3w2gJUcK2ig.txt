real talk if you're trying to get better as a programmer you're trying to you know figure out what to do obviously if you don't explore new technologies within five years you're going to have kind of a lot of atrophied skills meaning that if you haven't gone over data structures in a long time like your ability to be able to build say a keyboard is probably really really small you know what I mean it's not it's it's not that it's it's it's a bad thing just that's what happens when you let skills atrophy and so how do you keep up with Joneses how do you keep up with everything that's happening at any point in time well it's actually pretty hard to do it's also really simple to do you know just because it's simple does not mean it can't be hard first up review data structures every now and then just simple ones none of these like exotic ones you get from leeco just normal ones right ones that you can run into in your daily job or help you with understanding right know how to walk a tree pretty well because guess what walking a tree that's just like walking Dom notes right it has a real one-to-one implication with your real life uh but second okay amen amensa I'm over here pouring out my heart trying to give great advice if you try to emotionally bruise me this is true cam just browsing me right now I've lost my entire you just shot my train of thought I had this glorious point to make and now it's completely god um hold on I'm closing I'm not even reading chat just give me a second the second best thing you can do is obviously Building green uh Greenfield projects uh in Technologies you really really welcome to Costco I love you and I do mean that because Greenfield projects help a ton they're gonna just expose you to things in really non-annoying environments what do I mean by non-annoying environments like press one in the chat if you've ever had to maintain a bigger project and you wanted to add like say a small feature and the small feature which in a green field should have taken you 20 30 minutes but during a big project it takes you literally like two weeks right and here's the deal the reason why that exists and why that's so annoying is that just doing anything in these larger abstracted environments are super painful and so learning from Costco I love you oh thank you learning through Greenfield is extremely important and I want you to know that now it's extremely extremely important and I want you to just take that and internalizing it you know internalize it because you can take what you see in Greenfield and apply it to larger projects it just takes a lot of time and effort versus the other way and so I just want that kind of be like a you know a mantra in your heart that hey I need to be able to uh always be expanding my skills investing new things and this is why when I say hey you should work hard I mean you should do your job and you should make the people around you happy you should not be quiet quitting you should not be doing the bare minimum because the bare minimum is never going to be good for your career growth or really your own personal growth but on top of that you should be exploring outside of work I still call that work because in the end it's for work it's for you becoming a better engine nearest for your future I don't know what you call it replace it with whatever words you would like and just taking that and spending some time outside and exploring these new texts because when a problem arises at your job that requires somebody with experience outside of the current domain of the job you're going to be that person more often than not because you're exploring other things when your team comes across hurdles you don't need Bob from the back end to tell you what to do instead you can just be like oh we gotta do these four things don't worry I got it hey yeah I know where it's at I know how to get into the code base for the surf don't worry I'll take care of these things you just know and you can move fast and honestly it's going to make a huge difference in your life you know what I mean it's just going to make a big difference in your career in your ability in your confidence just seeing more things makes a huge difference because I know so many of you struggle with this idea of confidence right you're just you're just internally feeling like you don't belong you don't fit you have imposter syndrome welcome to Costco I love you hey thank you tier three let's go I do mean that I appreciate that and you struggle with it you know with with imposter syndrome you really do and why do you struggle with it it's not because if you measure your past you can if you soberly measure your past you've been given problem after problem since learning how to program before knowing what an if statement is to being able to solve data structures and algorithms from there all the way through you figured out welcome to Costco thank you you figured out how to solve these things and successfully move forward but you're not applying your track record to your life you still feel like you hear things you don't understand and it robs you of confidence you don't even have a box to draw around the concept and so expanding how many boxes you can draw welcome to Costco I love you thank you sir I really appreciate that side note like it gives you like by expanding your box of confidence you're able to draw more boxes out there you're able to understand Concepts even if you can't program them and you're able to talk about them to reason about them and that is such an important facet is just seeing things seeing things gives you confidence for whatever reason I don't know why that is and you know what if you have the opposite of imposter syndrome honestly that's better I'd rather have you on the Dunning Kruger side than have you on the Imposter syndrome I love you I mean that and I genuinely do mean that I 100 mean that if you're not on the dunning-kruger side you're constantly questioning yourself and often you're falling short of what you can do if you're on the dunning-kruger side I think I know more than I can you're going to be constantly butting up against and going across the edge of what you know because you're jumping into things you don't understand as well but you believe in yourself you can actually do something with it please be on one side not the other side even if you fail on one side it is so much better failing than it is to never try every single day of the week so there you go sorry I felt all I got all you know I got all into that I don't know what that I don't know what the hell just happened there but the name is the primogen
