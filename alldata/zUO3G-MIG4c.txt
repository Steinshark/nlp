hello everyone and welcome In this video thought I'd do a little bit of a long-term update on my Subaru Crosstrek and specifically talked about how this thing does in snow I've only thing for about five months I've got 1,500 miles on it so I haven't driven that all that much about a lot of the time that I have been driving it has been in the snow going up and down this mountain road to go to the ski slope and there's been a lot of snow we actually have 15 inches on the ground at one point and I was driving around in it the back alley behind my garage gets really built up with snow gets really deep right now I'm the shots that I'll show it's not quite as deep it's rained since and so a lot of it has melted but still fairly deep back there if you enough that I can't get my s2000 out and this thing is honestly just been a champ it's been able to handle pretty much everything I've thrown at it definitely in the really deep snow you know there are situations where I'm burning the clutch a little bit because I'm slipping a little too long you know there's not a low gear range in this obviously but it's been an awesome vehicle in the snow and you know these bridgestone blizzak ws80 which I put on it after this winter season they have been great as well may seem to have really good grip you know in really bad condition so they've been nice to have. A little things I wanted to talk about was how the all-wheel-drive system in this vehicle works and basically subaru manual transmission vehicles motor vehicles with manual transmission can have very similar setup as far as the all-wheel-drive system so you've got your engine torque that has a 50:50 split throughout this coupling To the front rear axles and then there's an open differential in both the front and the rear so you've always got a nominal 50:50 split going to the front and the rear and then if one of those actual starts to spin up because it doesn't have traction that viscous coupling in the middle that's purely mechanical device will send torque to the other axle which has more grip so no electronics involved with that this coupling and it can differ that torque ratio is it won't be 50:50 know maybe an 80:20 split or 70:30 split to the axle which has more grip now one of the interesting things that I've noticed while I've been driving is i've heard the ABS motor kicking on while I've been driving in snow and that's why I've been on the throttle and so I didn't realize I didn't know if subaru actually did this or not but you know a problem with open differentials is if I have one of the tires in the front spinning and one of the tires in the rear spinning that means that basically have no traction I'm not going anywhere well super has a clever way of fixing this which is fairly common in the industry there's different cars that use this trick as well but what they do is they call it LSD very cleverly limited-slip device rather than differential there are not there is not a limited-slip differential in the front or the rear there is that viscous coupling in the center but what this limited slip device does is if one of those wheels start to spin and either the front or the rear you'll use your brakes to break that, slow that wheel down and then you're going to send more torque to the wheels that actually has traction and so that's a good clever solution I mean it's actually been really helpful i've heard it you know coming on while I've been in really deep snow you'll hear that abs motor that individualize wheel that slipping and so you can send torque to the other side so really there's very few scenarios because of that feature that you know you're going to get stuck in this vehicle you've got plenty of ground clearance 8.7 inches when you get the right tires on this and it does a really great job so I've been really impressed with it honestly it's been pretty amazing now isn't an STI like no the STI has limited slip front & rear and a really cool center differential which can fully lock up this can't do that and it doesn't have those super high-end off-road features it has more ground clearance than the STI honestly I wouldn't have been driving the snow that I was driving in this with my old STI just because it didn't have the clearance that this has so the all-wheel drive system in this is really good you know it's not like it's got full locker front and rear you can rock crawl and it doesn't have a crawl ratio so you know you're limited by your first gear's ratio which is pretty aggressive and you can crawl pretty slow but even still i find myself slipping the clutch in certain situations where I'm going really slow in order to get over an obstacle smoothly so you know it's not the world's greatest off-road vehicle and that's certainly not what I'm trying to say here but it does a really good job of handling snow and ice in situations like this which i'm driving in this year is very minor stuff but I've been in some much deeper stuff in this vehicle and as long as you keep the momentum the all-wheel-drive does a great job of sending torque to the wheels that have traction on these tires you great job of accelerating braking turning etcetera so I've been really pleased with it overall as far as some of the other downsides of the vehicle just kind of getting into the long-term ownership thing I still do you wish you had a cool engage and it does have the rev hang which is a little annoying honestly I've gotten used to it and I don't notice it quite as much I'm but basically what i'm doing every time I shift gears is letting my foot completely off the gas pedal waiting a little bit and then I'll close the throttle and then pressing the clutch in and shifting and then it will be much quicker and smoother but there's that period of time we're just letting your foot off and waiting for it to stop giving it throttle, so a little annoying I've gotten over it it's not a sports car that don't care if it was sporty I'd be a little more frustrated like how the WRX behaves in a very similar fashion and you know you want to be shifting quickly in that car versus this thing is just something to put around in but honestly aside from that it's been awesome having ground clearance it's amazing what you can go over with just a few more inches over what you know most stock vehicles have like my STI had almost six inches which is good but then you get closer to nine inches and it's pretty impressive you know how few times you're encountering situations where it's like no I can't get over that. those extra couple inches actually go a long way especially when you have a shorter wheelbase vehicle like this crosstrek so I've really been enjoying it overall fuel economy is one thing I did want to chat about and i can pull it up and see what it's been I've been driving a lot of city traffic and you know driving in the snow a lot and driving when it's really cold in short distances it's been doing 23 mpg for this tank which isn't that good I believe that's actually it's city rating but I've been driving in deep snow and letting it idle and warm up and stuff like that and doing different videos actually did a video with it just sitting there idling for 10 minutes so my overall average for the car with these fifteen hundred seventy miles on it is 29 miles per gallon and that's you know I've had a car topper on top so from an arrow standpoint its head that up there and done a lot of stuff not on roads and driving in snow and stuff like that on these 1,500 miles so 29 miles per gallon I'm pretty pleased with that considering the conditions and the fact that i've had that big chopper up there you know which is just basically a big wind block that's just the air brake whenever whenever I'm driving so overall yeah i mean fuel economy I think it could be a little bit better the CVT that I drove i was easily able to get into the mid 30s - hi 30s, I even did some some highway driving and I managed to get 41 over like 60 miles or so in the crosstrek CVT so you know the manual transmission definitely does takeaway for fuel economy is concerned but you get higher wheel torque on better acceleration in the manual version them CVT so you know I'm willing to trade off for that and it's you know more fun to drive now if you're wondering why the cinematic quality, why the video footage from this video with a little bit better than usual that's not my doing you know that I'm not that talented with the camera that's the guys from gears and gasoline Ben and Ben they're awesome they've been hanging out for the weekend and we're doing a video for their channel which is gonna be what it's gonna be called? getting to know engineering explained getting to know engineering explained it's going to be kind of a glimpse into my channel so I'm gonna include a link here at the end of this video which you can click somewhere in the middle or whatever and also include a link to their channel so you can check that out they've done this with some other channels regular car reviews that didn't blue and that didn't blue and do it with Dan so they kinda got these little mini documentaries on different channels that are pretty cool you should check them out thanks for watching
