and the first demo will be CPP depend here we get the demo started from CPP depent um it's a tool you can go to C depend.com uh to get the overview and download the demo let's get the demo R okay so hello everybody I'm Isam from cpbt and team I will show you quickly some uh major futures of our product and also show you a futer that we launch next month uh concerning artificial intelligence in speed pend so first Speedy pent is uh very easy to set up you have just to add your project to Parts it could be V Studio or cake whatever after that you can launch the analysis and you have the result after few seconds to few minutes depending of the size of your projects so first we have a dashboard you can see many metrics in dashboard can have dependency graph uh so you have a dependency Matrix to go deep into your dependencies you can just double click to go inside of each independency have a three map Matrix and you have also many out of the box ruls uh for cting St that we like sered Mis and others so for example Cod mes you can just check what Cod mes do you have and you can get quickly many interesting issues found by CPD pend so after that we can have also uh a files view so we can just click on a file you can navigate to your issues and uh also check if you have any difference between two version after the modification of your code so you can get technical depth of the issue s of the issue and also many interesting metrics about your Cod so what I want to show you today is our next future so until now with CD pend we have many Futures but the user uh have some difficulties to find what he wants from the tool because we have uh we have uh many panels we have many possibilities many Futures uh in the menu we have also many possibilities so it's a product with uh many many FS that's very difficult to use at the beginning but with this new future we can uh go at exactly what we want just by asking with uh human language for example there I can ask for most complex methods and uh automatically I have the result I can double click to go or click to go to the source I can get more details about the result by clicking there so I have the result there also I can export the result to the graph and Matrix and html text or whatever for example there I have the result with the complexity but I want also to add lines of code so automatically lines of code are is added I can also add many other metrics in the same grid uh it's very easy to to do that can for example I want High issues sity high in my code so I can have I can have the result can click there to have more details about where the problems exist for example in this method I can double click to go to the source uh uh I can for example ask for most recurent issues in my code it's interesting to know which kind of issues is the most uh existing in my code so I can have quickly the result so this future is not available today it will be available next month with our next ma version so you can access to all the CDP futures very easily for example I can ask for a graph of found project I have a project named foundation so I can have there so automatically I can see that Foundation use STL Windows IPI and uh other liaries external liaries so this is our next maor Futures that will make using of CPD pend uh uh very easily I can for example ask for the audit also uh I can ask for audit of the foundation project and I can have a visit so there I have a a summary of all the problems the major problems in my projects uh concerning the coupling coion of types uh method two bigs method to complex and they have many metrics about the project I have also which type which classes I have to check because there are complex in the code or which method I have to check I can audit also just one class for example can ask to audit only so so this class uh I see that's not cisive only one method high C highly CED and can have the Matrix of the class and which method is the most complex in this class I can also ask for a summary of this class so the summary give you just a uh just uh a quick Des deson about your class for example the class is part of which name space which project class has how many methods how many fields it's small CL class has two Constructor one virtual method two static methods and uh most used type by this class most external type used for example there and uh which type are using this class and also some metrics about this class and some links can have uh Su code and graphs Matrix graph and DEP graph so the summary give you a quick idea about a class so for any developer architect or designer whatever he can just use this new feature to ask exactly what he wants before he must check many possibilities from the menu from the panels to get exactly what you want but now it's very easy just ask spend with your natural language you can ask uh even in German in French whatever uh it's not a it's not just English you can ask for your with your human language not exactly English and you can have a result uh so it will will make the CPD pent very easy to use and uh to begin uh with without having difficulties uh from the beginning and also uh for example we have many other features for example for the graph uh it can have many possibilities for example I can go back to the world gra for example I I search for specific class don't automatically it Zoom to the class concerned uh I can after that go to this class uh generate gra of coloris for this one it Zoom exactly to this class what's happening there and with the tool bar I have many option to check exact all dependencies of this class I can export to The Matrix to get more information about dependencies for example there I have all dependencies in the Matrix to get exactly what's happening uh inside my my class we have also the Matrix view uh The Matrix review it's a view with a rectangle if for each rectangle represent a class so the red rectangle are uh the class that that's not maintainable because the color is proportional to the maintainability but we can change the metric there the size also by default is proportion to lines of code but we can also change the metric so we have many possibilities in um in speed pend and you can quickly customize as you want as you want your queries for example there from the from the cing query I can uh for example there I can get the methods uh where the complexity is more than 153 so I can do it quickly uh and you can of course use any other matrics there uh because we have many metrics in Speedy pend so you can quickly uh develop your custom rules custom queries uh with CPD pend also you can for example uh ask uh for example how much cost the resolution of file implementation class you can also ask question like that can give you this value so why this value because we calculate this value from the technical depth and from there you can customize as you want it's depending think of how much cost a man hour of development in your case and how many hours in day uh we have some customization to do there and uh using the technical depth we can have approximation of the money needed to resolve a class or a name space or a project so with speed depend we have many many many possibilities and I think with this new future it will be very easy to to use it uh with your next version so uh I hope that I give you um a brief description of CPT pend and if you have any question you can send us an email to our support we' be more than happy to to answer your question yeah um there actually one question is there like a a license for students available yes yes for students and for open source projects so if uh for for students and any open source project it's free okay nice and of course there's the website which I um posted to Linkin um so thank you for the demo that's nice tool which you've built over the years there
