hello everyone and welcome in this video I have teamed up with progressive and we're gonna be talking about car safety so how do you know if a car is safe what does it mean if a car has a five-star crash rating versus say a four star or a three star crash rating so we're going to decipher what these ratings mean and the testing that goes into coming up with these ratings so if you look at any vehicles Monro nice sticker typically you're gonna see four different ratings so you're gonna see an overall vehicle score a frontal crash rating a side crash rating and a rollover rating and each one of these is gonna have a star rating from one stars being the worst to five stars being the best so what's the difference between a one-star and a five-star crash rating well let's go through each one of these individual tests talk about how it's done and then what that star rating actually means so the first test we're going to get into is the frontal crash test rating and so the scenario is you're driving down the road single lane in each direction and as you're driving along down that road the car in oncoming traffic veers into your lane and then you both collide into each other head-on obviously you want to make sure the occupants are safe in this scenario so the frontal crash test has two crash dummies in it you've got the average-sized adult male which will be sitting in the driver's seat and then you have a small adult female in the passenger seat and both crash dummies will be wearing their seatbelt the car is then accelerated to 35 miles per hour where then runs into a fixed barrier so the front of the car is colliding into a fixed barrier at 35 miles an hour and this is representing two cars running into each other both traveling at 35 miles an hour now wait a minute why does one car traveling at 35 miles per hour running into a fixed wall equal two cars both traveling at 35 miles per hour into each other so if you think about a wall and you have a car hitting it at 35 miles per hour if that wall is truly fixed meaning it does not move it has to provide an equal and opposite force in order to prevent the wall from moving when that vehicle runs into it so if you think about two cars traveling at 35 miles per hour once they collide that position of where they hit each other is not going to move if they weigh the exact same so they'll collide and then their relative position will remain the same that fixed position where they start won't move because they both weigh the same Wahl is just providing that energy back at it equal and opposite and not moving as a result now this also means that if you have two vehicles you can only compare their crash-test rating if they actually weigh the same I think then of course it's going to change that interaction so if this vehicle is heavier than this vehicle as they collide they're going to move towards that lighter weight vehicle so when comparing frontal crash test ratings it's important that you only do so with vehicles of equal weight so here's how we get into the star ratings the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration takes a look at the dummies after the crash and after the crash they make measurements all over on these dummies and they see they look at the head they look at the neck the chest the legs and they see what is the probability that someone in this incident would have gotten injured and so that's what that star rating is it's a probability that you would sustained a serious injury in the event of this type of collision and so each star rating has a different probability associated with it so five star rating means you have a very low chance of having a serious injury versus a one-star rating which means you have a much greater chance of sustaining a serious injury in comparison to a five star rating now both the driver and the passenger will each get their own rating and remember it's important to only compare cars within about 250 pounds of each other in order to make sure that it's a valid comparison when saying your likelihood of getting a serious injury in this vehicle is less than this vehicle because it has five stars versus four stars or three stars you want to make sure that you're comparing within the same weight class now let's get into the side crash rating and so there's actually two tests that are performed in order to determine a vehicle's side crash rating so the first test the scenario is you're driving down the road you get to an intersection you come to a full stop and as you start driving through that intersection someone else ignores the stop sign and collides into that driver's side directly into your vehicle this test also uses two crash dummies so up front you will have an average adult male in the driver's seat and then behind the driver on the driver's side you will have a small adult female dummy and once again both dummies will be wearing their seatbelts the car will be held stationary and then you'll have a three thousand fifteen pound moving barrier that will slam into the side of the car where the driver and the rear passenger are sitting at 38 point five miles per hour after the collision each seating position will receive its own star rating so the front passenger and the rear passenger both being evaluated looking at their head neck abdomen and pelvis for injury and so the star rating once again is going to be the probability that a passenger sitting in this seating position during a side-impact collision is going to receive a serious injury five star of course being the lowest probability and then one star being the greatest probability of having that injury occur so that's the first part of the side crash rating the second part the scenario is you're driving down perhaps a windy road you're going a little too fast and you end up sliding off the road and as you slide off the road the side of your vehicle that driver's side runs into a telephone pole so for this test there's just one crash dummy you so it's representing a small adult female driver and yes she is wearing her seatbelt for the test the vehicle has rotated 75 degrees and then it's dragged at 20 miles per hour into a 25 centimeter diameter pole where it impacts at the driver's seat location after the collision they'll then evaluate the test dummy for injuries so they're gonna look at the head neck lower spine abdomen and pelvis and so that's going to give them the probability of serious injury in that vehicle for this specific test and that of course applies to that star rating so each star will have a probability of serious injury occurring again the higher the star rating the lower the probability of that injury occurring so you'll see you have a star rating for both the front seat and the rear seat that front seat will be the average of the two side impact tests where the rear seat is just from the first side impact test now an important thing to mention with the side crash test rating is that you can compare any two vehicles so because both of the tests are exactly the same for a side impact test rating you can compare vehicle regardless of how much it weighs so if one car is a five star crash test rating and another car has a four star crash test rating but they weigh completely different you can't actually compare them and regardless of their weight difference the one with the five star crash test rating has a lower probability of you having a serious injury and a side collision the final safety rating is the roll raining and so the scenario is perhaps you were driving down the highway you take your exit and as you're getting on to that off-ramp you notice you know perhaps you're going too fast or the off-ramp has a really sharp corner so you try to make that quarter but you can't quite make it and your vehicle ends up sliding off the road and into the side and as it catches that side as you slide off the road the vehicle rolls over now unlike the frontal and side crash test ratings where the rating is based on the probability of injury for the rollover rating it's based on the probability of the vehicle actually rolling over and this is determined primarily using a vehicle's static stability factor the static stability factor is calculated using a simple equation which is a ratio of the vehicles track width which is the width between the centerline of two wheels versus the vehicles height for its center of gravity so a vehicle that is very wide that has a very wide track width will have a lower probability of rolling over versus a vehicle with a narrower track width likewise a vehicle with a lower center of gravity will have a lower probability of rolling over versus a vehicle with a higher center of gravity now using the vehicle's static stability factor you can calculate the risk of a vehicle rolling over and so this is how you get the star rating one star a probability of greater than or equal to 40% two stars between 30 and 40% three stars between 20 and 30% four stars between 10 and 20% and a five star rating means you have a probability of less than 10% for that vehicle rolling over so here we have two very different vehicles as you can see this one quite a bit taller than this one over here and so you can actually compare any vehicles directly for the rollover risk this here has a four star rating as a result of a 15.1% probability of rolling over this has a five star rating as a result of that lower center of gravity and a chance of just 8.2 percent for this thing to roll over now each of these three ratings will be used in calculating the overall vehicle ratings so you'll have different weighting for each category and then that will be used to give you an overall vehicle score so once again the overall vehicle score and the frontal crash test rating those should only be used to compare vehicles of similar size and weight the side crash rating and the rollover risk rating you can compare any two vehicles now finally it's worth mentioning that all cars sold within the United States have to meet minimum safety standards so it doesn't necessarily mean that because one car has a lower star rating versus another that it's unsafe overall it just means that it has a higher probability a higher risk of injury occurring in that vehicle versus the other so this is really to be used as a tool for consumers looking at the Munro nice sticker and seeing how many star ratings does this have for the different tests as a consumer you can say you know if that's something that's super important to you if safety is super important to you you can use that to compare direct vehicles within the same category and say you know this one is safer than this one I'm going to choose it because of that so a huge thank you to progressive for partnering on the video and thank you all so much for watching if you have any questions or
