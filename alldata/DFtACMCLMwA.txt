foreign the queen of a certain kingdom was Barren though she wished it more than anything she could not have a child she kept her sadness hidden in songs and kindness but the king could discern her suffering through the smiles for years she kept her tears to herself her heart secretly praying for her long desired child one day on the Feast of Candlemass a crow perched in a tree just above her in the garden startled in her mending the queen pricked her finger and a drop of her blood fell onto the pristine snow she knew at that moment that she would have a child but her prayers had been answered she would give birth to the most beautiful girl in the world with skin as white as the Virgin Snow with lips as red as blood and with hair as black as coal so hello everyone I'm very excited today because we are going to present you the Snow White Project which is coming out on Kickstarter next week June 6th um as you know I started working we've been working on this for several months with Heather pollinson who's here with me and so I'm you know we're all both really nervous because this is like our little baby that we've been working on for a long time and uh you know in some ways we're really doing something that is both very strange and surprising but then also something which is a fairy tale like a fairy tale like everybody knows about so we what we want to do is we want to go through some of the reasons why we're doing this why we're doing Snow White you know why we're also doing this series of fairy tales and why we're doing it now so first of all Heather thanks for joining me you're welcome it's good to be here yeah and so Heather and I we met uh several months ago before we did this in White Project you know she helped me with the rebranding of the symbolic world as you know and uh I told her about this project that I was working on and so for several years now I've been thinking about fairy tales I've been thinking about them very much inside the symbolic World comparing them to Bible stories comparing them to myth and realizing to what extent you know there's just a a range there's just a scale between Bible stories myths and fairy tales they're really of the same nature it's just that some are more Fantastical you know fairy tales can be more Whimsical Fantastical they're able to stretch reality uh much more but ultimately they just follow very similar patterns and several people have had that intuition when you hear the story of Snow White you can see there's an apple and then she eats it and she falls asleep you know there's a Temptation and there's all that and and it's as if it's Just Right Out Of Reach what's this relationship to the Bible story you know what's the connection between the story and the Bible so this is something that I've been thinking about for uh for a long time meditating on trying to see what is going on in the Snow White story and uh you know I wrote this as a play for my children a while ago of course I've added it I changed it but a long time ago I wrote it as a little play for my kids as we were homeschooling and uh as I was you know after we finished God's dog I was thinking about that story I just kept coming back in my mind and I realized you know I think it's time to retell the fairy tales and this is in some ways a kind of cultural moment you know we've been watching for the past decade people try to reinterpret the fairy tales change them adapt them politically to our current situation make comments on them in some ways be quite cynical you know if you think of uh series like the Shrek Series where they take these uh all these fairy tale mashups and they make something very funny very Whimsical but also quite cynical about what is in this the fairy tales and there are several versions of that uh both for adults and for uh children uh they're you know the uh Disney had a series called once upon a time that had like adult versions of the fairy tales and you can kind of see all their their kind of uh desires it's more like a soap opera and so there have been many efforts to try to kind of dive into this fairy tale world but to do it in a way that like I said is it's a bit dark and a bit cynical and my intuition was maybe it's time to jump back into the fairy tales and do something similar create a kind of world where the fairy tales cross each other where the characters uh you know continue on between the different stories but ultimately with the purpose of creating Insight of about what's in those fairy tales and so the project is for kids you know you can read the story to your children you know it's a beautiful storybook very we're doing it you know with beautiful materials like a you know like a 19th century fairy tale storybook that is well-bound and it looks amazing uh but the idea is there'll be two readings in the fairy tale one for the children one for the adults but now it won't be dirty jokes and kind of you know uh references that just go over the head of the children but rather there's a layer that is deeper in insight and is trying to help people see what is really going on in these fairy tales and so I'm quite excited and you know this seemed like an Impossible Project but I've been very fortunate to be surrounded by wonderful people and Heather of course you know has really just amazed me to what level she's been able to capture the vision of what it is that I wanted also everybody knows I love medieval art I love you know traditional icons all of that and she was able to kind of create a visual language to join you know more let's say uh 18th 19th 20th century fairy tales early 20th century fairy tale styles with the the power of medieval storytelling and so uh so so Heather you know maybe you can you can tell us you know first of all I'd like to know because this is a strange wild project you're a professional artist you know you've been doing all these projects with big with big franchises Disney and all these companies and so here's this like icon cover that actually if you're willing to help him tell a bunch of fairy tales and so what is it that made you accept something like this okay um well there's a bit of story behind this and it kind of goes back to around 2017 and I was working on Maleficent two um in England and it was having a great time on that film it was a really fun project we were doing loads of really opulent kind of brightly colored medieval stuff and um I had to do tons of research for that project obviously designing tapestries carpets things like that and and what happened was it was the first time really in my career that I managed to get the chance to delve into the medieval world I mean if you work in the world of film you are always jump in between different eras you know like eight months you're on Victorian and then the next month you're doing like 16th century Amsterdam or something so you have to switch very quickly between all these different languages and this was the first one that kind of combined medieval and fairy tale for me and when I started researching I just came across this art and it was it literally just knocked my socks off it was so interesting and I was like how did I not know about this before um so I'm going to show you some of the art that I encountered and kind of what it did for me and that sort of gave a lot of the impetus to this project but it's something that's been kind of brewing for a few years and when you came along it kind of all came together for me so I'm gonna take you through um so when you're working in film um it's very much like a magpie culture and we're always looking for things that are going to kind of best transmit our story so you're looking around in the world of design and you're trying to figure out like what is this artistic language how can it be used for storytelling and and ultimately how does it affect the audience because you know last time I was on here I was talking very much about you know what it is to design for film and very much how we you know think about emotion and how we can drive plot you know with different um different uh languages and yeah so I started looking across the sort of Medieval World it was the first time that I um encountered iconography and I was also looking at manuscript arts and I started to notice there is like very specific technical things that this art was doing that was just really impressing me so I've just labeled it up here I'll just go through quickly and very Dynamic poses and breaking the frame um simultaneous depiction of multiple moments in time symbolic use of color and a manipulation of scale to transmit meaning and also using complex perspective systems that Converge on the viewer and I was thinking what what is it that about these features you know what why is kind of early Christian art developed in this way um and I was looking deeper and I was thinking everything whether it's like 2D or 3D it's always projecting out and and it's like it's so powerful and it's like I see it in churches in England these are across the bottom you can see their roof bosses which are um architectural details that meet in the ribs of Gothic architecture and but they're some of my favorite things and they're so creative um and I think obviously yeah so I was thinking like why why does IT project out in the way that it does it's so Dynamic you know you can see here this in this Mosaic you know it's like there's a shadow there because he he kind of comes out so I was thinking the only thing I can think of is because you know Christianity is all about receiving in so many ways isn't it it's all about like receiving the word receiving communion and I think of receiving the image it's the same thing that these are definitely art forms that are made to be received and and kind of transmit story to us so I just want to make this kind of Point really obvious there's two depictions here of um Emmaus and the one on the left is a roof boss the one that I absolutely love and even though you know it's pretty dilapidated unfortunately these figures have lost their heads it's like when you make your way around this roof boss you're actually experiencing the whole of this story you've got um Christ here with the pilgrim bag coming in on the walk then you've got him at the table and then you've got him um you know ascending here as well so you're like experiencing the whole story and to me it's like experiencing these is like similar to experiencing scripture because when you're reading scripture you kind of meditate on things you come back to it it looks different from different angles so you're sort of experiencing it in a fresh way every time and I think I just want to compare it to this um painting here which is like the most famous um version of Emmaus that we have by Caravaggio um and although it's wonderful it's doing a very different thing it's kind of it's it's a it's a moment in time it's it's painted in a realistic way and this is like the father of like the Cinematic um language and also you know the the snapshot so that it's pulling you into a different dimension basically whereas this one to me is kind of affirming um you you actually reading the story there so this is the kind of art that I really love it's kind of it's Universalist in style it's it's using a lot of elements to kind of transmit a massive amount of story in in one in one piece um so I was also interested in the sort of correlation between like art and scripture and so when you came to with the project um I looked at this like the kind of language that you'd used in the fairy tale and um it seemed very interesting because it's like we seemed very concise it's like you considered every single element of it like everything seemed considered that there was like the explicit um elements and also implicit elements so there's definitely like kind of layers to it I don't know if you could talk about that no but it's interesting that you also the way you said it and I think this is something which will surprise people when they read it is my model for writing the fairy tale is very much scripture in the sense of the the scripture has a way of telling a story which is very concise uh you know and very simple without you know stopping on Long descriptions or describing interstates like there's none of that in scripture it's it's quite direct and so I thought that there was something about that way of telling the story like the way that the gospels tell the story you know you know for uh you know for a 19 for a Victorian reader is is is quite lacking but I think there's something about it which is so simple and powerful and it comes close to the way that the old fairy tales were told you know the the first snow white version is three thousand words it's very short it's very concise and there's a sense in which you can tell it in one sitting and so this is really what I wanted to recapture in the way that I that I told the story of fairy tale so every single sentence was you know fought over and thought over and trying to get to the essence of what it is that's not what it is doing and there's not a lot of there's not a lot of Flowery language and a lot of Flowery descriptions no it must be really hard because um like you say it's it's a collective language isn't it it's done something that's basically been contributed to is probably an oral culture um and it gets changed over time and kind of distilled like you say that's very different from a kind of 19th century novelist who has a kind of you know particular voice um but yeah so it's so what was great about it just this first passage is you know little things just kind of leap out in terms of colors and and imagery and so it was quite clear like you know where where you wanted to uh the things that you wanted to emphasize let's say yeah um so one thing I did next was um kind of dived into the world of fairy tale illustration um because obviously I was really influenced by Christian art but we're not you know we're not on a sacred subject and so we need to look broader and and find some kind of synthesis um so one thing I found that was really common in fairy tale illustration um that you talk of is is the silhouette and I don't know if it's like technical thing because books are very expensive to reproduce or you know I don't know what you think I was wondering if it's because fairy tales kind of deal with archetypes and so you know you you kind of only need a shape to tell you what that thing is you don't really need the detail they don't have a particular identity necessarily these characters but I think it's also because it's also to capture probably intuitively but it it's it's a version of the medieval storytelling we said we saw before because in order to create silhouette art you have to have the character placed in a manner that everything is recognizable uh in the movement they're doing so there's something that's that's very uh you have to like you see it in the images here you have to be able to see them from the side pose or from the front with the arms moving in a way that is very clear the action is clear everything is clear or else or else you'll just see a big black mass it doesn't make any sense and so it seems like a modern way to capture some of what we see in medieval art which is this frontal or side poses uh and very clear clear movement so um yeah so having found the silhouette then I looked into um what's called the Golden Age um and what was really interesting is this this guy here Heinrich Leffler um he was an Austrian artist and he was really drawing from the the Byzantine um style um in the early 20th century and I found out a whole load about that movement that was happening in Austria and in in The Wider Arts it involved people like Gustav Klimt and we know that obviously he was really influenced by the the mosaics in Ravenna and he brought that into the Fine Art world but Leffler was doing that in the the world of illustration so as soon as I found a kind of synthesis of of like Christian art and um and fairy tale it was like okay well you know we're clearly on Solid Ground here because actually this has been done before um and it was really nice to discover his work and Kenny Olsen obviously a giant of fairy tale illustration really looked at his stuff Errol McCain he's much later but kind of was real really big fan of uh Kay Nielsen and then this lady Mary Blair was a concept artist at Disney and I absolutely love her work she did a lot of really expressive um gouache paintings for Disney a lot of concept work that that made its way into the films so she seemed like a good touch Point as well um and you can see in these influences already some of what you ended up putting into the text yeah at career I've spent frustration from 1910 um and so I could have done that but I didn't want to because I wanted to make sure um that I wasn't just doing something like uh you know the the watercolor artist from the early 20th century because they've already done it and it's you know they've already done beautiful work so it's like okay we need to blend together some different aspects and try and bring out you know some have have a bit of 21st century technology in there as well so that was really important um to find a style that that sort of was a blend but there was also new um so speaking of Disney obviously as part of the project you've got to look back at all the incarnations of Snow White and we looked at a lot of illustration together didn't we but what kind of popped out was obviously the 1937 Snow White and the Seven Dwarves film you know it's the most iconic um adaptation everyone knows it it's amazing um but what was interesting was just looking around the um the production of that that film and what I found was that in 1933 there was another Snow White by uh the Fleischer brothers and the story is that they were the kind of East Coast um rival to Disney in the in the 20s and 30s and um their stuff is absolutely amazing by the way if you go on YouTube you can see their cartoons um they're so inventive but they're very very dark and their version of Snow White which you see on the left is absolutely mad go and look at it so it's got all like it's got the elements there there's Betty Boo for Snow White there's the queen and then there's some very strange creatures um and what I realized is that when Walt Disney made his Snow White in 1937 it wasn't like it wasn't coming into um a culture of like Snow White being wholesome it was he actually consciously decided to do a kind of radical traditional version of Snow White with new technology um and so yeah it seemed interesting to me because you've talked about you know what's going on at the moment in culture and the way the fairy tales are being depicted um and you know it seems like a similar moment that you know you could actually um do something traditional and it could it could um you know become interesting in that environment so yeah yeah I think that when you presented me this this is this image of Fleischer and Disney I think it was really it just hit me that that's exactly what it is we're trying to do and in some ways that's exactly the moment that we're in which is the surprising moment when things have been so twisted and become so surreal and strange that they're almost unrecognizable so like you said the Betty Boop the Snow White uh the Fletcher Snow White it's really fascinating and hypnotizing and and interesting but it's almost unrecognizable as the story of Snow White you really need to know the story deeply in order to realize that this is Snow White because it's all irony and comment and kind of joking about certain yeah in the story um and so it's this is a in some ways we're in the exact same position where exactly and when when you watch the Disney Snow White I think everyone looks at it and goes oh it's from you know it's old it's from the past yeah it's like the truth it's just this tradition that has been around it's just like no he knew what he was doing I mean just look at everything about it look at the titles you know he was Reviving medieval forms in in the late 30s you know for a reason so that that was really interesting um anyway so I got yeah I do loads and loads of research um I had tons and tons of stuff to look at and this is just a kind of picture of my process on the left is me in Thessaloniki and I went to an exhibition on uh Ravenna mosaics and that um people will know is quite famous pattern that made its way into the book as a kind of snowflake design so I'm basically collecting patterns and Designs all the time and then obviously on the right is like what you see behind me um so what I'll do is um because I've got all these elements I'll just bring them all together on a pin board and basically like after I've lived with it for a few months it tends to kind of synthesize in my mind and helps me make decisions as I'm drawing okay so this is the cover of um our book and just wanted to talk about it in terms of ornamentation now ornament gets quite a bad rep it's like always at the bottom of the of the kind of Visual Arts hierarchy but I have a love for ornament because I want to work with it a lot in film um and it can do quite a bit you know um so you can see that I've done a kind of decorative panel but I've drawn from um mainly mosaics but Byzantine ornament that I've drawn mainly from the more florid aspects you know because I felt like they would fit into you know the idea of fairy tales so getting kind of flowers and Vines and things like that and then um you see this pattern here that goes around um and I picked that because obviously you've made the kind of reference to Genesis and you know I've got the tree but you don't really want to show the snake so I just thought why don't we just have like a serpentine pattern you know it's like it's not so obvious but hopefully it's just enough um so that was the thinking behind that and then obviously the with sitting within the ornament there's lots of details of the story um so yeah that's our cover and this is also one of the things that was important to to both of us was you know when you think of fairy tale world you really see uh Neil Gothic is the way that people tend to go immediately like the way that people understand the Medieval World um there's there's certain tropes which if you if you if you don't think about it too much and you go simply at it you end up with kind of new Gothic or or at least late late Romanesque uh imagery and one of the things we wanted was to incorporate some Byzantine aspect on the one hand to connect with that medieval imagery but also to be able to have a bit of Wonder and surprise in the image yeah yeah okay so this is one of the illustrations and it's it's it's good that you said that Jonathan because um in in conceptualizing the style of it I really didn't want it to be a certain moment in time in a certain place um for the reasons that I talked about before I I much prefer art that is kind of Universalist and um I think my aim was it should feel like more like a kind of Christian dream world than you know oh that's a 14th century you know wherever um again I've spent a lot of my career doing very specific historical pieces um and I actually find it's much more enjoyable to draw from different sources and and pull them together but I mean people will notice yeah there's there's Byzantine there's also Romanesque um this one um I feel like was more you than me because you gave really specific description for this illustration I basically just had to draw it and you design the king and the queen I think um so I don't know if you want to talk about it well I think that the first thing to say is that what you said about a Christian dream world that is exactly what we're going for and it's not something that we're going for just in this project but it's something that I was kind of going for already in God's dog right it's the idea that we've had this interesting moment in history where Tolkien who is of a devout Christian created a fantasy world or you know developed a fantasy Trope in a way that was based on pre-christian and Pagan and uh you know folk elements uh and so what we're trying to do is in some way push that in in a direction that will surprise everyone which is to have a fantasy world but that is based really on on Christian tropes and on Christian imagery on Christian and you see that it's already there right in the fairy tale world it's already there very implicitly you know if you think of Disney's Sleeping Beauty for example like that's a Gothic you know math it really does take in some of the medieval and Gothic imagery but we wanted to do it in a way that's far more expensive explicit and so we're bringing in tropes of Christian iconography uh not explicitly but you know the way the story is told the way that that the layout is done and so here of course we have an image which is um you know basically the image of Constantine and Helen right that's that are standing together but that that is also joined with a kind of Adam and Eve uh image with the tree in the center and so really bringing in different images from the Christian tradition but uh telling the bring bring them in a way that most people won't know like if someone looks at this they'll just they'll just see it they won't necessarily understand what we're dragging into it but that is what that's what we're bringing into the image yeah yeah and I think you know for me the Byzantine world is pretty new um and I was really interested to study it but naturally because I live in England and I'm surrounded by kind of Western medieval art it's inevitable that that's going to come in and so I kind of welcome that synthesis and the other thing to say is you know in the in the medieval English churches that they were they were like um absorbing the Byzantine style and the Roman s style anyway and kind of appropriating it so all of this stuff is really linked together yeah so yeah as you said there's the by kind of yeah Helen I mean it's pretty clear right yeah it's very clear um this is the first Ivory we've looked at actually and I haven't talked about them yet but um I know that you're a big fan and it was a really big part of my thinking on this um job because um I just I love the way they're stylized and I I found them not particularly this one but there's quite a few I've looked at that are like these little like theatrical vignettes you know you often get these like frames with a curtain and then there's like you know one of the evangelists inside you know writing the gospels um yeah with architectural uh framed office yes exactly exactly that so um and I know that this whole project as you said was conceived initially as a theatrical project so again it seemed like a good language to go to um so yeah so this is um Constantine and Helen uh you know I looked at lots of kind of manuscripts with with the city and just turn it into a decorative frame again that's a nice kind of economy there um and then these if you look at these patterns here it's obviously had to design wanted to do a pattern for the key and the queen that had some coherence in the frame but they've got different um motifs in the king's one I found on a Byzantine robe and it had this it had this weird um thing going through the middle going in two directions and I don't know about you but there is a subtle thing in your um in your text where the king's kind of dubious and I was like yeah that's that's the right symbol for him you know it kind of varies too quickly and all of that and then and then with the queen you know this is quite a typical um brazanti design with the two birds but you know they're looking they're looking um away from each other so it just gives that unsettling feeling in the marriage I think um and again like all of this is historically accurate but I've selected it for story reasons um so that's the Rogues yeah so both of these on the left you've got the death of the queen um and on the right is um the death of Snow White and they again you gave me a direction for this so it was the icon of the Door Mission and so you can see there's a mirroring between the two um pieces um and again the reference with the ivory yeah yeah and so this is I mean this is an example where you know we're trying to pull in imagery from the Christian tradition without you know without being explicit people most people will look at this and never know what what we're pulling from but there's a strength in the composition right in some ways what we're doing is we're using all this powerful storytelling language that has that just was developed organically over centuries within the church and and you know why why couldn't we use it why shouldn't we use it and so the powerful image of of the woman of the feminine you know uh as this as this uh horizontal line in the image with the with the man kind of standing over being a vertical in vertical relationship to to the woman it's a it's a very simple powerful uh tool for for helping to kind of intuitively understand the relationship of the max into the feminine you know uh I mean it's very simple so yeah so it's but and when you look at it it's very effective you know both of those images are very effective and in terms of what they're doing yeah so the nice thing about this you've got the angle of his crown going down to the dead Queen and then that goes down there and then your eye ends up on Snow White who's the you know potential future I think um but I think yeah while we've got these two up I just want to mention if you see the way that we're using Silhouettes so like I said in your text there was there was explicit action and then implicit action so um here you've obviously got the queen and the um the king you know rendered in full color the um the Midwife is kind of half silhouette and then you've got the Widow Queen who's basically obviously she's not there right at that scene but she's kind of looming in the background because she's about to come on the stage yeah you know she she's just she's just a shape at the moment so yeah I wanted to reflect kind of the hierarchy in your writing with the kind of visual hierarchy in the illustrations and then you see with this one you've got the prince kneeling and that's because he's he's kind of submitting to her isn't he so we don't need to see the details of the prince at this point and all of the kind of um visual emphasis is on Snow White yeah and it's important to understand for people that you know while we worked quite so much on this this whole story because much of the there's a large well large there's a part of the narrative which is not in the text so there's a there's a there are little strains of narrative which appear only in the images and and so people have to pay attention to the images as they're reading to get subtext and to get some of the things that that is that are that is happening that isn't mentioned in the so for example the fact of the Widow Queen already there in the background as you know the the Queen the mother of Snow White is exiting the story that's a little hint of that but there are a few more of those as the story progresses yeah so this is the Widow Queen now I'm on the left you can see uh I think early 20th century illustration it's one of the many ones that I looked at but this one really stood out to me because she's it says at the bottom mirror mirror in my hand who's the fairest of the land and I was like okay that's different to what we're all used to right you know because we all know the mirror mirror on the wall That's the famous one and Heather literally had me change the way that I wrote it because she had such a great idea about this when I saw the image also of the queen holding the mirror in her hand I thought this is amazing she's holding a cell phone like she's literally taking a selfie and uh and I realized that that this for now at least this was really the most powerful way to present the the story so so it was it was a great change yeah so that's right so it was like this really at first it was like there's really something about this that I need to pay attention to and then eventually I realized and I was like okay so we're living in the age of narcissism clearly and you know we're all captivated by these devices and I know a lot of people have made um comparisons between phones and mirrors I think Paul kingsnorth was talking about it recently um and I started to think about it I was like yeah so um let's think about kind of the whole social media thing and how is that how is that like a kind of feedback loop um and I you know I'm on Instagram and you know now and again I put up a design or picture that I've done or something basically what you're doing is you're kind of looking for you know oh did anyone like my picture let's have a look you know it's like a little bit of affirmation right so yeah you're asking in the mirror who's the fairest yeah okay and and what Instagram does which is really dark is it um when you first join it shows you a lot of the things that you want to see But as time goes on it starts pushing more and more ads at you right so it starts to become undermining and um you know these days if I go on I just get told you know that I'm kind of old and wrinkly and all of that stuff because like they know I'm 45. and so it's actually an awful thing if you pick up the the mirror and you just you know so so I was thinking that's an interesting relationship so you're basically looking for something and you get the opposite um and then I started thinking about a bit more and I think we all know stories of people who kind of got So Into You know their Tick Tock accounts or Instagram that they've actually started to you know have surgeries and stuff and they end up kind of destroying themselves you know because they become so captivated with The Narrative of of the mirror right so this is what happens to the queen she starts to believe the mirror of more than you know say her husband you know the king clearly loves her but again the danger we have in the modern world is we're not seeking affirmation from our families we're actually seeking affirmation in the algorithms and so there's this very dangerous kind of thing that can happen that can destroy you and I thought okay so that's maybe this is one of the reasons we're making Snow White now because these themes are so kind of present and in our version I really did try to push that you know it's so weird that I I had that intention in this story to to bring about something like that but I didn't think of the mirror in the hand when you showed it to me was like yeah that's exactly what I'm doing and and so the idea is that uh the queen you know ultimately ends up destroying herself herself she ended up just she ended up destroying herself through this Obsession that she has uh with finding out who's the most beautiful and so that image of the person you know looking in their phone or obviously it's not just that but that's a good example of what's going on looking in their phone and then becoming obsessed with the tropes of beauty like you said to the point where they will destroy their faces destroy their body or become caricatures of humans sometimes it's not just it's like even these makeup all these like makeup tutorials where you know people you can see like they're just caking it on in a way that looks good on the phone but you can tell even looking at the in the photo that if I saw this person in real life I would run away from them like with all their like really strong lines on the nose and all that it's like it's it's this living for the mirror like yes it's it's wild it's like transforming yourself for the way that the the the phone takes a picture of you yeah yeah yeah because you're so captured by the mirror and then that's what these images show that she's you know we never really see her interacting with humans we only see her staring into you know but she's she's staring into the mirror or staring eventually at the Apple which becomes the kind of um you know the end of things yeah so yeah that that was a that was a really fun thing to to kind of weave through it um these are a couple that kind of look look um nicely together and the one on the left is the death of the king and the reason I'm showing this is um because there's been a lot of chat recently about you know fatherlessness and and so I really wanted this one like it's framed by the death of the king um and in the middle is Snow White looking so vulnerable um and she's obviously playing with with a ball that is the same as the fruit on the tree and so and then up above we can see the queen with the hunter so again they're in silhouette um so so but yeah it's what it's one of my favorites actually um and on the one on the right is a prince and I gotta admit that was my little Indulgence I just wanted to draw a princess of course I think you kind of let me get away with that it wasn't really kind of that part of the story it's like this is the portrait of the print it's perfect right even though in the story we don't talk about it that way but it's like like I said you know if you you're going to represent the prince and you want him to have presents and and a kind of Regal quality you know having him on the horse is the best way to do it so it was a perfect choice yeah you let me have that one yeah and I was very happy with that Okay so so then double page spread at the palace so this is a nice example of you know lots of things going on um you know multiple um activities going on in one in one frame and we see the prince meeting Snow White um by the time he leaves he's in silhouette against the rosy Dawn um I think the the main thing to say about this one is it's really really influenced by the the ivories yeah and you know the first drawing I did was was literally just in in Ivory a line drawing and um and this is it kind of colored up but yeah I think it was the first one I did as well wasn't it I think it was I think it was because it was also very complex and we wanted to do a lot in the image yeah and sometimes it's the one that looks the most like uh uh almost like a medieval illumination you know because of how how it's split into with the colors and you know it's a flat architectural Motif with yeah characters inside the windows very theatrical as well I mean it's like I think of it as a stage set this one yeah yeah that's one of the ones also that I'd kind of worked hard on I did designs of it myself with with someone else trying to kind of figure out how to do it in a way that makes sense yeah yeah inherited quite a lot from me on that one but the um you know like the Gargoyles and the angel and everything it's really nice details um next one showing is them it's the Woodland scene um so all of the Alice illustrations are quite formalized um and I knew that once we got into the woods it had to get a bit Wilder um the the reference on the top is was my main touch point for the for the woods because I just knew like as soon as I read it I was like the the trees are going to make our frame so this is a like first sketch that I did um and then this is it colored up but it was such a good idea to move from architectural Framing and then keep the framing aspect but use trees to do it it's a very simple intuitive change but it it really marks the transition between uh like Into the Wilderness and into the the Wilds of the Woods yeah so we can see the hunter there and there is very much a you know a sense of that kind of downward path that she was going that she's going down into the dwarf's house and then um in the text it says a quirky house stood there as strangely charred like house so um yeah I really wanted to make it look you know tiny and strange and um obviously yeah like you can see there's a silhouettes of animals um the hunter I really like the character of the hunter yeah pretty face looking isn't he yeah yeah um but yeah anyway going on yeah so this is um uh Snow White in the cottage and she's eating at the doors table and with the I mean this one I just kind of just saw it in my head I didn't really know like formally whether it was going to work but it was definitely influenced by seeing those roof bosses with the kind of you know you've got like two perspectives I was I drew her and then I was just like I'm just gonna flatten out that table because it's I know that you said to me uh the whole scene in the dwarves Cottages was all about um pointless repetition or Cycles yeah it's as if she's you know the idea is that Snow White you know part of the part of what Snow White is is of course the transition of a young girl into Womanhood and one of the things that it seems to show is that when Snow White you know makes that transition she falls into a space where she's in contact with all these uh you could say uh let's say unacceptable Mates is the good way to understand it so she's dealing with like all these quirky idiosyncratic old men basically or that don't that can't be her her husband they can't be you know her they can't join with her and so and then she learns to clean and cook and stuff and so she has all the negative aspects of what it is to be a woman let's say a tradition traditionally so she she's with all these you know like these old men that don't that that are like quirky aspects of what masculine is and then she's cleaning and cooking and so she needs to find her prince like she needs to find the reason why she's going through this transition in the first place and you can understand that also just in general like a woman's body changing and at first having to deal with this cycle and like what is this thing like what is this painful annoying thing that I have to deal with all the time what's the reason for it uh and then ultimately realizing in marriage and in and in child and in having children that that oh that's the reason like this is in some ways what this is for so that's what we wanted to suggest in that part of the story yeah so I definitely want ing lots of circular motifs and also all the um illustrations in the dwarves Cottage feel much more kind of psychological to me for some reason you know like there's a there's a transformation happening and it's much it's much less um figurative and naturalistic um so this is the illustration of the dwarf's house um and again it was you know it's like a doll's house basically I've always loved illustrations of houses where the front's taken off and you can see in all the little rooms um so again there's a lot of circling motifs and um there's the drawers I didn't really I emphasized the idiosyncrasies of the dwarves that they're kind of like a a unit if you know what I mean that seemed right for some reason because we were having such emphasis on her um and so yeah I think it's I think it's perfect and then you kind of see them going up there with their their clubs and their knives yeah that's great yeah yeah um and here's a couple of illustrations from the end um so here's the witch we've we've already seen with the apple and then um Snow White after she's eaten the Apple um you know in very simple choices that are that are intuitively right to have the you know the architecture now grown over with thorns and uh you know obviously the crack mirror and all of these images and having also the you know the the in the the beginning when Snow White enters into the dwarves house you have all these cobwebs and there's like this unsettled aspect of what she's going through and what she it's like things haven't settled yet she hasn't found the reason and so the cobwebs appear at the at the dinner table and then they appear again here in the in this kind of moment where the witch is losing control I could say we could say or kind of devolving into into uh kind of obsessive Madness yeah yeah um that's it actually because I've I think we need to leave some well of course we can't show all these can't show all of them um but yeah there is a lot of things hidden in the illustrations and I really hope um people will be interested to buy it and and find more um this is uh just to show this is gonna be the frontis piece this is like a drawing I'm doing at the moment it's kind of work in progress um that'll be at the front of the book yeah and um this is yeah this is our Kickstarter campaign basically a couple of images from there we're gonna have so the idea is we're really going to so we're trying the way we're doing the kickstarter was really first of all to try to make it uh accessible to everyone who would like to get it so you know the the first prices are quite reasonable but then we realize like we're really we're doing it making a treasure here like we're really making something that is quite unusual at this time to make something so celebrate celebratory so ornamental like unapologetically you know uh diving into all these patterns and stuff so we thought we need also to give people the opportunity to really jump in and go crazy and so the you know the highest tiers have a leather bound book with like uh with actual little jewels on the corners and and we're having I'm also doing a very complex illustration of the scene where Snow White uh receives the Apple from the queen um you know and I'm doing all these details very similar of course to the way that Heather did it because that's also my go to right is to think in medieval style to have everything compressed into an image so I'm also making one uh and we're doing all kinds of stuff we're having we're gonna have pins and and it's gonna be it's gonna be really uh for people who are interested in it like they can really jump in and and have a lot of fun with this Kickstarter so we're we're definitely I think you'll see how excited we are about this project when you see you know everything that we're putting into this Kickstarter so this is really the beginning to be honest this is the first book we're going to do eight books in all um that are going to take the same approach to storytelling but as you notice when as the stories continue they'll they will accumulate references and they'll be crossover of characters and you'll see the fairy tale World kind of come alive and start to make sense more and more to you the uh I've already written four of the fairy tales I still have a few to write and Heather has agreed to work as artistic director on the whole series and so we're gonna have a through line it's going to be coherent and and uh visually powerful um and we have great illustrators in line to do this so it's going to be really wonderful where I this is honestly the mo the thing that excites me the most about my work at this time is is this fairy tale series and also starting the symbolic World Press so that we can do this and we can continue to do this so uh and so yeah so Heather thanks for for taking being such a in some ways it's a big risk for you to do something like this and so we definitely appreciate the the amount of time and energy you put into this oh it's been brilliant I've really loved it and um yeah I hope yeah I can't wait to see it printed so everybody go to the kickstarter page you'll see the link in the description um this might not be we might not have started yet if not you can sign up to to to get uh reminders when we're starting and if we've already started the kickstarter then please back it you know and share it to your friends and everything because we this is a we think it's a watershed moment it's time to to re-celebrate our stories it's time to do it unapologetically and and in a way also that is going to bring more insight to what these stories are about not just naively you know not just innocently but to take some of the knowledge that has been uh Unearthed in the postmodern tropes uh but then apply it to a higher good so thanks everybody for uh paying attention to us I hope you're as excited as we are and we'll talk to you very soon thank you
