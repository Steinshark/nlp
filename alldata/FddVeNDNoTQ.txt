get back to the video thanks sponsored Gotham oh my goodness sit back relax I'm about to take you to vikon in the Netherlands we will begin with the Monumental game of the day the Women's World chess champion J and June taking on Ali Resa fua the Frenchman so French in fact that he tries to play a French from the first move of the game he really did not want to face D4 so he went E6 and he said you know what w Jun you can play E4 go ahead and do it because I'm going to go D5 I don't exactly know what he was trying to avoid uh but uh clearly he he just wanted a French he really really wanted a French he didn't want to play Knight F6 and he gets himself a French now here Jan June plays in a very annoying way like a French player's worst nightmare is to get hit with a symmetrical exchange French because there's a lot of lines in chess right and you know she spent two minutes she spent about she spent three minutes roughly because she gets bonus time on this move so took her three minutes to decide you know what let's play a French but then let's take right and then and then there's this and the problem with the French exchange is that black is playing a completely symmetrical position but black goes second so black needs to spend the entire game catching up the only way to win a position like this is to play very aggressively and take risk like there are certain variations in the exchange French where uh White plays Bishop D3 and then black plays Knight C6 and plays Knight E7 and then you know tries to Castle Queen side and creates a big fight but J and Jun kind of knows that she's playing a young man right she's playing Ali Rin and he's 2760 and he might just try to play for a win at all cost so she's baiting him into a boring positional struggle if you take take you're playing like a Queen's Gambit accepted he plays Knight F6 he's waving the red flag in front of the bull he's like go ahead play C5 she does takes Pace takes Pace pushes his Bishop backwards and then they both Castle White has a tiny space advantage on this side of the it's not really anything cuz black can always play B6 he's going to go here he's going to develop his Knight put pressure on White Center White is going to try to remove the bishop okay okay then develop and develop like this so she's supporting her Center and she's supporting her Knight you'll notice both of them are already spending a lot of time I think I think both of them are relatively unfamiliar with this position you know instead of playing Queen F3 and allowing her Pawn to be doubled and blocking her own Bishop by playing Knight D2 she could commit her Knight to the C3 Square for some reason I can't draw Arrow right she can commit her Knight to the C3 square but instead of doing that uh she plays it like this and she spends about 15 minutes doing that and the position is Rock Solid however Ali resent does not have a lot of forward Mobility he can't really move his pieces forward his plan here could be to trade the light squared Bishop undevelop this and pl plop a knight into E4 and then try to reposition and fight back on the queen side so when June now says okay I'm going to go and I'm going to Target your queen side I'm going to Target this Knight and I'm going to unpin myself and and go over here worst case scenario we trade some pieces and I'm fine with that because I'm CU you're 2760 right like at the end of the day I'm okay with that all res it takes but again she kind of knows who she's playing right oliv Resa could just sit back try to solidly defend himself no he plays Bishop G5 very provocative stuff allowing the Knight to to to get taken to damage the structure uh she does in fact do that white can't just go and take this Pawn uh cuz if white does that you're you're going to lose material over here so instead of that she just plays rookie one and ex changes and the resulting position is one where white has some long-term potential pressure will put the Knight on the E5 square but black can always play F6 so like you know F6 Knight F3 your Knight's never going anywhere right black will just defend himself put pressure and we we might have an interesting end game where white puts a bunch of Pawns on dark squares in all likelihood we're headed toward a draw Rook e one they trade everything Queen E8 and now she plays Rook E1 and the idea could be to play E4 which Ali Resa promptly shuts down says no no E4 for you uh maybe I'll go Queen G6 I'm still going to try to attack you remember aliv is trying to win the game because he's the you know he's got a he's got a high rating and he he's a he's young and he might be playing the player and not the position he plays F4 getting really aggressive she plays Queen F1 she gives up this pawn and the intention is to play Queen D3 so the pawn can't move cuz he would take the queen Pawn comes down and now white can play Knight F3 actually computer gives G4 as a major advantage for white trying to trade the queens and go to an end game where Black's Pawn structure is not going to do him any favors he caused damage to his own structure early in the game for hopes of long-term compensation but he's not going to get it now instead of playing G4 and weakening her King she plays this which makes a ton of sense she wants to play Rook e to and now Ali Resa can play Queen E4 and Bishop takes Knight and both of those lead to slightly unpleasant end games for him where black will likely hold and instead he goes here and it's not exactly clear what he missed because after Knight to G5 his Queen is hanging and queen H7 is a threat so he has to trade the queens and now white is much better the computer doesn't even fully reflect this it's over plus one in terms of evaluation white is going to have tremendous long-term pressure this bishop is not going to touch any of these pawns cuz they're all about to go on the dark squares and now Jan June is just going to go to work black cannot defend his Pawn Ali resa is a pawn down this is absolutely insane he tries to create counterplay with his Rook she re centralizes the Knight and puts another Pawn on a dark Square now it's time for the next phase of the game she's going to defend her own pawns he creates counterplay she puts another Pawn on a dark Square she's now got five out of six pawns on a dark Square she now has six out of six pawns and eight out of nine pieces on a dark Square so Ali R's Bishop is completely useless now it's still holdable but King D2 she's looking for a Way Forward B3 she makes a break now she has a pass a pawn Bishop G2 The Rook goes to E3 she's looking for a way to make him make a move King E1 Rook B3 King F2 and now in this position Jan Jun does something that might go down in the history books as one of the greatest endgame calculations of all time look at this position I'm going to try to explain this to you to the best of my ability here we go in this position she can play Rook e one attacking the bishop and forcing a sequence or she can play Rook E5 forcing G6 and then play Rook e one one of them is a win one of them is a draw if J and June plays immediately instead of Rook e one and attack on the bishop if she does this and keeps the pawn here what will happen is Bishop here Knight here check here Rook F3 take take here Rook A3 Rook E4 and in this position black will set up a defensive Fortress so the only winning idea is to move the rook and win the pawn and that will go here here here here here Rook D5 Rook G5 but this is a draw because the king gets there in time the difference the difference between what she does in the game and what I just showed you was a 13 move long sequence 26 moves in total and she calculated that if she forces the pawn here which is what happens in the game and then she does the exact same thing the difference is black already spent a move black already spent the move doing that defending his pawn and what happens is after King F2 C6 King G2 Ali Resa cannot do the same thing because Rook E5 Rook D3 Rook G5 Rook Rook D4 Rook G6 Rook D5 Rook G5 Rook G5 HG King E6 white king gets there the difference in what I showed you in the game is the positioning of the King by one square this is otherworldly level calculation this is magnesian dare I say he's not playing in the tournament I know you guys all ly always says magnes this is that type of this is crazy the fact that she calculated rookie five black invests a Tempo and then that's what's going to happen in this game Ali Resa realized it went here and it didn't matter because he went on to lose the end game anyway Rook D6 King here black is already down upon Pawn he's going to lose another one J and June women's world champion defeats 2760 rated Ali Resa fua this is maybe her high this is definitely her highest win ever in this tournament she has played a series of games against the highest rated people she has ever played against look in chess men and women don't play each other a lot at this level they just don't we're not going to get into that now but that's just the way it is that's the way it's always been clearly we got to do events like this more often cuz that was unbelievable you know what else was unbelievable this game elen robers rubers I don't know Dutch folks y'all got to get me once and for all how to say her name versus Hans Neeman who I I think is like half Dutch by the way uh so you know I don't know his name is easy to pronounce though um Hans demon is tied for first in the Challenger section Elina has zero points she has played four games she has as many points as me all her games are very combative they're very exciting but she has not she hasn't gotten on the scoreboard it's just been a rough event I had a tournament once I lost all my games I went 0 out of four it's a rough feeling and now she has to play the highest rated player in the in in her Section who starts out with a caroan a man after my own heart Bishop E3 she plays like a sideline of the advanced variation Hans plays Knight E7 now we have a little bit of a of a of a pawn lock on the queen side both players very much on their own very very big maneuvering game all the pieces on the board no trades she plays Bishop D1 she plays Bishop D2 Elina plays chess like an avalanche like snow is going to start pouring down a mountain if she gets an initiative and by the way so does Hans all right so she kicks out his Knight she stabilizes and now it's kind of like okay if neither side wants to get in a fight they won't like both sides can just Shuffle H says let's get in a fight I'm rated 2692 I'm tied for first you're zero out of four I got to take over listen I'm sorry it's nothing personal she takes and now the position begins opening up and plays Bishop F4 and black is better actually if black plays D4 which he does in a moment like Black's better I mean he's taking over the game he's got the active Bishop he's got the active rook and I mean yeah it it we're headed to out of five territory I mean it highest rated player in the section I don't think she's the lowest rated I think there might be one or two other people but like she's had a rough event that's just how it is she plays Bishop B5 she takes control of the light squares Hans plays here building the pressure takes the pawn on C3 now Elina has this weakness on C3 Hans rotates his night around I mean just a great game a great game vintage Hans performance getting another win on the board but she never stops fighting back I mean she plays Rook C1 she plays here right Queen F3 Hans tries to remove the bishop and I mean she has lost a key Defenders three of her five pieces are stranded on the back rank but she's just defending she's just playing stubborn chess this is a this is not the kind of game that she likes to play she wants to attack she plays fiery chess explosive chess she's on the back foot here she's got to play C4 Hans making all of White's pawns just come forward and get stuck in the mud and now it's just going to be a matter of time till he converts right well she's defending herself I mean she's got weaknesses but they're not falling anytime soon Rook D wait a minute what just happened suddenly a rook is like plopped into Black's position that's weak that might be weak in the long run I mean these Rooks are biting on granite who the heck is going to get rid of this bishop rook d8 and we cross 40 moves per player and Hans goes here and uh those little pieces that were standing on the first rank she gets rewarded for her excellent stubborn defense ah they're going to go stand up to the bullies now cuz uh they're all very well coordinated and if Hans takes the Rook she's getting a pass Pawn these pieces look good but they got no targets Hans plays Knight D5 she just takes he goes here take take G4 the second Elena was given a chance 45 moves into the game there was a tactical opportunity that presented itself H is he's stuck if Bishop G6 take and you can't take Bishop E4 you lose the queen and out of nowhere a tactical Skirmish leads to Hans Neeman being down on Knight and it goes from bad to worse because now the king is under a violent attack she doesn't trade the Queens she plays Queen F7 he gives a check but the black king is completely defenseless it doesn't matter who you are here Queen C2 Rook C3 this is mate the king is safe Rook d8 Queen B3 Hans Neeman resigns to a fork Lena robers just she went 0 out of four she just beat a 2700 this is what I'm talking about welcome to T of Steel oh my goodness oh my goodness where did that come from she was in an unpleasant position for like 36 moves it was just Hans finding and it was just a matter of time he just couldn't find The Knockout like somehow look at this you got the whole Squad monitoring a pawn just defending defending but he just he just couldn't break through EXC excellent defensive resourcefulness from her turned into really nice offense she just beat her high this is the highest rated of player she's ever played and she beat him crazy I got two I I I I got some more games for you this is param makulu dingl Ren this game was bananas param makulu is having a rough event dingl R's having an okay event he just lost to Prague and he plays the same exact type of way that he did against uh gesh you probably don't remember that game cuz you remember nothing but that's okay he played like this against uh against gukesh all right he got this very aggressive setup this a very common Italian setup nowadays you know who came to fight today though param makulu dingl Ren played G4 attacking parham's Knight my man Pam went here he said ding that's a free horse go ahead and I looked at this when I woke up and I went yo dingly Ren looks absolutely roll smoked in this position how is he going to defend himself look at this let mean we we are a moment away from a complete knockout Rook f8 now if you play Knight D5 in this position I actually sack my queen I actually don't mind this because I get a knight a knight and a bishop for the queen and computer says it's equal but that's not the point the point in this position is that white can actually start playing moves like Knight F5 Knight F5 check first he can play Queen G3 and then Knight F5 but Knight F5 Bishop takes Queen takes it's and then and then you got like D4 you try to bring the rook in F4 you try to bring the Rook not you can't hang your king but you play King H1 first but param spends a long time and instead of continuing the attack he goes here he spends 27 of his minutes and he gets the king off the center line but he gives ding just enough time now ding controls G4 and he's bringing his Rook to the party and at the end of the day Pam's down a knight so he goes here plays Knight D5 ding uh has an opportunity to sack his Queen but we get this position and the game very quickly Peter's out we got a we get a repetition of moves in a game that looks set to explode I mean Pam spent 27 minutes and decided I'm not going to go for it that would that would have been nuts if he got a win versus dingly Ren to to stop his bad streak prag Nanda versus Anish giri these guys are winning the event Prague opens with a jobava London Knight C3 Bishop F4 uh Anish plays a symmetrical London not a symmetrical because obviously the night placement is slightly different and then we get C takes D3 this setup of doubling your own pawns opening gets super dank early on uh in this position Anish giri rather than developing or castling undevelop his Knight to its home Square because white wanted to go E4 E5 so he repositions his Knight to E7 before I mean this is like very like if kids are watching this you can't play chess like this never play chess like this Prague takes some space away on the on the queen side repositions his Knight and then plays a fantastic positional move Queen A3 volunteer steing a queen trade and a doubled isolated structure which would allow him to pressure with his Rooks and early in this game this looked like a positional Master Class waiting to happen we had a big exchange we had Knight coming to E5 Rook C1 the pawn is looking like it's going to perish Anish has to create counterplay really quickly which he does Rook C1 takes takes this looks Prague is looking ready to just win this game no questions asked H3 H6 but just like in the Hans game sometimes it's hard to find a way through so he goes Queen D1 he tries to reposition and go the other way maybe pressure down the center line but it gives an just enough time to start creating some counterplay white had good pressure the whole game pressure on D5 pressure on C6 but Anish defended himself Rook D6 and Prague decides to trade pag could have played Rook C7 and actually I'm not really sure why he didn't maybe he saw a ghost he didn't want to get checkmated but he has a very comfortable plus. six he could buckle down and try to play five more hours but instead he trades the pieces and probably thought he had something but the players just repeat moves and then they go to a night end game and King F1 and draw offer draw greed Prague looked also just like in the previous game set to put on a lot of pressure a very surprising decision here to trade the Rooks very surprising but clearly he was not as optimistic uh about his position as the guy who's sitting here with the stockfish evaluation right so it's one thing to like play the game the other thing is is this now two decisive games uh to end the day Mark Andrea maritti French grandmas versus haime Santos latasa this game was Banas this was a Catalan in the Challenger section A Clos Catalan black playing in a this doesn't even look real it straight up looks like white is mouth slipping bro he just went B4 if white can play B4 in a Catalan the Catalan is ridiculously op because you just put pressure here look at what he got not this is not what a Catalan is supposed to look like a Catalan is a slow sophisticated maneuvering positional game what the hell is this who set off the trampoline of Pawns that you're just allowed to throw at your opponent in the game Queen C8 now finally haime Santos says all right bro I've had enough there's no way this is Poss Knight takes D5 the horse has broken through the stable it can be captured three different ways but there's nothing you can do because if you take it I will take on B4 if you take it with a knight then I will take here and when you take here of course I'm going to take the pawn and C of course I'm going to take the bit in this position Mar Andrea sacrific his other Knight Knight takes up seven this is a circus this is a circus every single piece is hanging everything is hanging and Knight D6 is a fork and if you get out of the position first I'll take your Rook then I'll take your Pawn I'll Take Everything Knight takes F7 is unbelievable and he attracts s the king into the center he says come to me King takes now I take the bishop and now we have this moment where black goes oh I'm cooked I'm completely cooked there's nothing I can do what do you what do you defend against how do you possibly defend this position black is up two points of material but the king is butt naked he's just running around the board somebody get him back into his uh into his house King F7 he brings the Rook oh this is this is real bad these Rooks are open and attacking what are these bozos doing they're stuck they're not moving Bishop B5 now we start hunting the king from the diagonal Queen B3 look at this like a serpentine Queen A2 Queen A3 Queen B3 then we go to E3 then we go to F4 and then we take and now the black position falls apart while the king is suffocating the rook in the corner black has this Rubik's Cube going on over here what the heck is happening he takes and when it's all said and done it's over you cannot take back because I would just take I would take simple move I get the king out of the corner I win The Rook I win the game Mark Andrea maritti they should mint this game all right that's what they should do Rook takes D7 and you can't take because Queen C4 check and I make a queen bro Take a Bow take I don't even I don't even just that's what he should have done that's what he should have taken B can you imagine the level of disrespect in chess drama we would get if a man took a b in the face of another man dear me this was one of the most gangster games I've ever seen in my life dude played a Catalan then played B4 A4 A5 this doesn't even look real and then he developed all his pieces and just absolutely slaughtered his opponent like oh my God I got another game for you before you go by the way gesh versus nepo implications of who could win the first place prize we have cd CD Queen D4 this is an isolated Pawn opening black is going to try to push the queen back white develops and a few moves later white actually does not mind getting his Queen hit because he could get move out of the center Bishop D7 and the game is going to be played where white will put pressure on Black's structure that's what white is going to do Knight to E5 you'll notice that nepo has spent almost no time from the opening Rook C8 and clearly Yan is giving him a pawn kukes takes it because it's free but the cost of that pawn will be an initiative on the other side of the board while your queen is stranded over here black will play Rook A8 Knight E4 activate the pieces put long-term pressure on these pawns that's what he does I just said that Rook A8 Knight E4 now we're going to have a trade of Bishops Lukes takes the Knight gets his Bishop taken brings the Knight back the bishop comes back the Knight comes back so gcash is a pawn up two Knights versus two Bishops the position is deemed equal because despite White having a pawn Advantage he's under a lot of pressure his pawns can't really move they are symbolic pawns but it's a it's an equal position Queen A5 Rook D2 Bishop D7 but at the end of the day white is a pawn up like he's got a really solid Advantage so Rook B8 Queen F3 and if nepo is not careful and he allows white to get too many Preparatory moves right White's going to try to take advantage of certain things like you're staring at these pawns but you're not taking them and right now the move d4 probably clears out the board probably we can trade we can play Queen here take here Bishop G5 G3 I can get a pawn back then I'll get this like that move clears out the board but Jan doesn't play it Yan keeps the tension and within the span of a few moves gkes is centralized and then gukesh plays B3 so he's not going to let his pawns get taken then he puts the Knight on A4 then he brings the queen out to G4 then he doubles up in the dwn and then as his Rook is attacked in this position it's still about equal Yan misses Knight takes C6 The Rook is hanging but the queen is worth more KES is a Gotham chest subscriber he knows about danger levels but it's worse than that it's after Rook takes D5 gkes now has three pawns for the Knight and the queen cannot guard the bishop anymore so the only thing you can do is fire back Queen slides over Rook D6 you can't take the queen cuz if you take the queen I take with check King H2 and then I have this move at all times I'll go here and I'll fire away from a distance so we have Rook D6 Rook takes D6 and when the do settles he's up a lot of Pawns Yan can win one of them back but uh they're just going they're just going up the board and my man gesh takes down yanomi with Knight takes G6 six threatening to win his bishop and going up multiple Pawns in an end game and nepo resigns gkas just beat yanomi oh my God here are your standings after five rounds what an unbelievable day of action oh my goodness Anish giri still in first place Four Points Four Points also Erin Lami in the Challenger section but today it was less about these results because it's a tight race and bunch more rounds to go J and June takes down Resa fua and Elena robers takes down Hans nean with some other monster games behind that that is just unbelievable stuff I'll see you in the next video get out of here
