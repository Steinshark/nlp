this just in the price is 700 and it crushes the steam deck go buy one that's what I'm gonna be doing dbrand sponsored this video and sucks to be them because this is all they get a 30 second clip of me telling you to go to Best Buy and buy an Rog Ally which is especially funny because they don't even make skins for it yet I'm kidding of course you guys are getting a full video and it's gonna be a long one that dives into what makes the Ally great and address the inexcusable BS that Asus dished out during the device preview for this thing custom SOC uh no ASUS says that at 15 watts they are up to 50 percent faster than the steam deck and at 35 Watts they are double the performance those are some big asterisks you guys oh right and you completely failed to mention that you get beat at 10 watts but hey you are still walking right you better be because these things are going to sell out immediately the Z1 extreme SOC at its heart packs eight then four cores and rdna3 Graphics an Asus has paired it with 16 gigs of high-speed ddr5 memory and a 512 gig Gen 4 nvme SSD all for just fifty dollars more than a top spec steam deck there's just one incy Wincy problem with our limited time we made the call to test fewer games at more power profiles and I'm really glad we did because we found some interesting stuff like the fact that at 10 watts the steam deck mops the floor with the Ally somehow Metro Exodus Forza Horizon 5 and returnal all saw basically half the performance in both average FPS and one percent lows showing that again no matter what kind of Hardware anyone seems to cook up the steam deck just crushes the rest of the field in the super low power draw weight class I don't know what kind of Wizardry valve is employed here but it is unbelievable until we add a bit more juice where their advantage completely disappears at 15 watts Fort says one percent lows are now double the other way offering a much smoother and more responsive gaming experience on the Ally and all three games saw the Ally take a sizable performance lead here anywhere from around 15 to 20 on average now that's not really the up to 50 Improvement that we were told before but it's still better than a kick in the teeth now it is possible that at low settings we might see a different story or maybe if we tested many more games but we felt like these were pretty representative titles and 720p medium was a fair reference point for both consoles what isn't fair is how hard the Ally starts dunking on the competition at 25 watts we saw anywhere between a 40 and nearly 70 percent Advantage across our test Suite which to be fair isn't quite Apples to Apples the steam deck runs at 800 P rather than 720p but in the real world I would much rather have the smoother gaming experience than the extra little bit of vertical height it's not small like it's the difference between playing on medium and playing on Ultra it's the difference between playing at 30ish FPS and playing at almost 60 FPS and it gets even better you can take this thing with you anywhere but if you happen to be plugged in Asus offers a 30 watt turbo mode that widened the Gap substantially in at least one of our test cases look at this this is Metro Exodus a visually impressive AAA title released just a few years ago and it's running on medium settings at 100 FPS on average on a handheld I guess Jesus finally did find incredible now one similarity between the two devices is the battery both are packing 40 watt hours and at 15 watts which is a good Power Balance for both of them and matched screen brightness at 60 hertz we found that the steam deck's performance was a little bit longer however it's worth noting that the steam decks included charger is only 45 Watts Max versus the Allies 65 watt charger so the Ally crushes the deck when it comes to charging time unless of course you upgrade to a third-party charger but by the time you do that well you might as well have paid the extra money and gotten one of these because here's something the steam deck can't upgrade to 1080p baby and not only is the Ally is display higher resolution it it also 120 hertz and while many I dare say even most of the games that you'll wind up playing on these devices won't reach such high frame rates whether it's due to Performance or due to frame rate limiters some of them will and even for those that won't it also supports variable refresh rate to reduce screen tearing leading to a much smoother and more enjoyable experience in everything from games to Steam Big Picture Mode Asus Armory crate or even plain old windows 11. more on Armory created Windows later though because I'm not done talking about how great this display is Asus advertises seven millisecond pixel response times but we measured an average of 4.4 with virtually no overshoot I just can't get over how smooth this thing is or how beautiful the colors are we didn't quite reach the 100 coverage of the srgb color space that they advertise but 95 is not only not bad it trounces the steam decks easily 73 percent resulting in a noticeably richer more vibrant picture that really Pops at least as long as you keep it protected with the tempered glass screen protector from dbrand there I mentioned you guys alright this is especially true if you crank the brightness to 500 nits which makes it genuinely playable Outdoors on a sunny day at least for a little while it's worth noting that like the steam deck if you crank everything especially the 120 hertz refresh rate you're not going to be gaming for very long under the shade of that tree the display is surprisingly color accurate too though managing an average Delta e of just 3.6 but it's worth noting that both of our devices skewed a little bit cooler in color temperature and adjusting the color temp on the Ally Only seems to bump up the Reds a bit so we'd recommend leaving it on default now since Cal man isn't supported on Linux right now we have limited means of measuring the deck's color accuracy but I can tell you that with its much worse color gamut it it is certain to be worse one thing we were able to compare though is brightness the steam deck is advertised as 400 nits typical but we've actually measured over 550 nits on two separate decks which clearly beats even the impressive 500 nits that we measured on the Ally Why valve is advertising it solo we have no idea but side by side the steam deck is visibly brighter if only by a bit the deck also gets dimmer than the Ally 2 though something that I care about a lot as someone who games in bed late at night we measured just 4.6 nits minimum on the steam deck and 14 on the Rog Ally to be clear both are really good but once again valve is cooking up a secret sauce that I wish the competition could match fortunately for Asus they have their own secret sauce there's zero gravity thermal system as stupid as that sounds it works while both devices stay cool inside and out the Ally stays cooler where it matters the most under your hands and this is largely thanks to the addition of a second heatsink under the hood that gets its own dedicated vent at the top now don't get me wrong the exhaust on the Ally gets hot especially if you're gaming in turbo mode where the whole device can drop to 48 watts feels like a hair dryer but what's great is that the vents are positioned in such a way that it shouldn't ever bother you and I'm much happier with all the heat venting away from the device instead of spreading through the Plastics into my hands it's almost as comfortable as our new Northern Lights t-shirt check it out lttstore.com now most impressively the Ally does all of this while staying shockingly quiet and I can't express how big of a difference this makes I mean I can show you these graphs where you can see this bump at around 800 Hertz that represents the wine of the steam deck fan Apologies by the way for our high noise floor here we're still waiting on our acoustic testing chamber but the bump doesn't tell the experiential story and it's huge like it's the difference between me recommending that you play with headphones on and telling you to put your headphones away and just listen to these awesome speakers that was another pleasant surprise it doesn't get talked about much but valve is really good at audio and somehow the Ally manages to be even better the steam deck gets a touch louder but the Allies frequency response is more balanced and it doesn't need that extra punch to drown out its stupid fan it kind of feels like the deck is the beta and the Ally is the final release here at least on the hardware side another area where the deck still wins handily is ease of use admittedly to those of you who are new to steamos or handhelds in general there is still a learning curve here it's just a lot smoother than Armory crate SC asus's proprietary software that's used to quickly change settings and access all of your games in one place I think the best thing I could say about Armory crate SE is it's not nearly as awful as I expected the leading games from the game library though doesn't also uninstall them and if you uninstall something it doesn't get automatically deleted from the game Library opening Armory crate also doesn't pause your game which could lead to some mistakes since the button for it is right below the start button if you use the game Library rather than just Steam Big Picture for some reason the background behind your game tiles will change as you select each game which I guess is a cool enough idea yeah but in practice it's a blurry mess and super distracting it ends up feeling more like a bug than a feature another small but Annoying issue is the contents of the content menu why are things like update center help center and system specs in content rather than in settings I mean it's not the end of the world it's just weird and if we use asus's other button on the left side of the screen it opens Command Center where you can quickly change things like your operating in control modes your refresh rate your FPS limiter Etc really cool it even lets you customize the tiles but then when you use a tile it opens a new window it doesn't automatically select that window so you open a keyboard or your game profiles you gotta hit a button or tap the screen first before you start using that window on the subject of Windows in spite of Microsoft's 10 years of effort the touchscreen experience is not great to overcome this the Ally comes with joy to mouse support but it's a little bit finicky not only did the auto control mode not always swap elegantly when we switched over to the desktop but manually changing to desktop mode would sometimes take tapping on the screen to get it to register that pressing the thumbstick means that I want a cursor then if you swap back to Gamepad mode after you have a cursor sometimes it'll just stay there except now you can't control the pointer anymore I mean these are minor gripes that I fully expect to improve over time the deck had all kinds of Gremlins in the software at launch too but you're not buying this for what it will be you're buying it for what it is and valve's put in a lot of work that Asus simply hasn't yet that doesn't mean this is a clear win for valve though the Ally enjoys some big advantages like the ability to use any game launcher or anti-cheap that you want or rather are forced to use and the ability to install apps the same way that you would on a regular desktop computer you want Discord simple want to do some video editing on the go sure thing just I hope you plan to plug in your own peripherals there are rumors that Microsoft is working on some kind of handheld gaming mode for Windows but for now in most applications you can have fun clicking on a text box opening Command Center to open the keyboard closing Command Center typing without being able to see the text box so hopefully you didn't make a mistake closing your keyboard and and then pressing enter to add your username awesome in all seriousness you can speed up this process a bit by mapping actions to any of the buttons for both Gamepad and desktop mode which is great personally when I want to access the keyboard I swipe up a couple times from the bottom and then press it in the system tray it's just that no matter what your ugly workaround is the current implementation can be annoying to the point where you just want to take the device and throw it at the wall and then you take a few deep breaths you go hey at least I'm not on proton DB right now checking to see if my game is supported at all now we already talked about this in our preview video but if the steam deck feels too big and unwieldy for you the Ally wins again it's 61 grams lighter which isn't which is a ton but it's enough to feel significant and we had a few people who daily Drive the steam deck hold it in their hands and it's unanimous the Rog Ally is more comfortable there are drawbacks no touch pads no 16x10 display and the face buttons are not great I managed to get the x button jammed on mine at least a dozen times on my playthrough of stray on the Ally and I hoped that the production version would be a bit better but the bad news is it's not well maybe a little better oh it's jammed yeah maybe a little bit of lube would help but I told them when they came in I was like you guys need to fix this in the final tooling and it's pretty clear based on how similar this is to our prototype it was already pretty much mass production for General use both offer desktop modes and hooking up to a dock is just one cable which is sick but the Ally once again takes the game to a whole different level its interface is proprietary that's bad but their XG mobile external gpus get twice the bandwidth of usb4 or Thunderbolt that's good they're only available with expensive Mobile gpus in them that's bad but they allowed nearly desktop like performance on the sort of go that's really cool and it could be even better if Jesus would pull their heads out of their Collective butts and make a desktop GPU compatible enclosure that can use this XG mobile interface the Ally isn't perfect the onboard Wi-Fi 6E is ripping fast but it's soldered to the board so dead Wi-Fi equals dead motherboard and so far Asus hasn't announced any kind of iFixit partnership like valve has and can I just say I really don't understand why they couldn't do a full-length m.2 SSD in here there seems to be ample space but it's a big Improvement in some of the most important ways while coming in at a price that could best be described as disruptive most consoles are initially sold at a loss and the hope is that you'll make the money back selling games and subscriptions on the platform in valve's case the math is pretty simple steam rakes in butt loads of money through both games and microtransactions so it makes perfect sense that they sell the steam deck for as low as 400 dollars but most people aren't buying that one for most people they want a substantial sized SSD and that's where the Ally gets price competitive which is surprising I mean to be clear I'm sure Asus is making money from the Ally fundamentally it's what is it it's a Chromebook with a decent SOC in it but I'm willing to bet they're not making much which might explain why they begged us to show their XBox controller clone in the preview video even though it wasn't even a working sample by the way we have a working one now and it's pretty cool I guess asus's big Advantage seems to be their volume I mean compared to valve I think they're moving a lot of steam decks but we can tell from the crowdfunding campaigns of competitors like Aya Neo and GPD that those guys are expecting to sell thousands of units of a given system and those thousands of units have to cover tooling costs marketing and r d for the Next Generation product to undercut them by literally four hundred dollars at the same spec Asus needs to move a lot more than thousands of units they need to move hundreds of thousands of units the good news phrase is though is that they will eventually because I strongly recommend this thing at least I do until more competition shows up but because of that recommendation the fact that this thing is so competitive bad news is I suspect it's going to be out of stock everywhere for weeks or even for months the bright side of that is that hey for the time being the steam deck is a much more okay option still than Asus made it out to be its software is more mature it manages better battery life in low power mode and it's got a much more robust accessory ecosystem including third-party hall effect joysticks and a whole lineup of cool stuff from dbrand including their skins screen protectors stick grips and of course their kill switch case which is back in stock now we're going to have all that linked down below there I mentioned you guys again do I get my check now if you like this video be sure to check out the preview to see how the Ally handles gaming with an RTX 49d mobile GPU I mean No One's Gonna spend that kind of money so we kind of ignored it for the review but send for us fast and this thing can rip at least this version of it can you might have noticed we ignored the lower end version of the Ally that uses a Z1 non-xtreme processor that's because we don't have one yet and also because we kind of agree with Asus most people are probably going to go for this one based on the price and performance difference at least on paper I guess we'll see
