I sent 385 US dollars to the nwn lap factoe Outlet on AliExpress and in return I received this it's got a 16 inch 2560 by 1600 type screen a fully mechanical keyboard 16 gigs of RAM five free included accessories including this sleeve and an aluminum shell this might be the best value gaming laptop that I have ever seen unless they skimped out on this that is so cool and on this oh no and if they screwed this up the closer we look at this thing the more questions we have but spoiler alert I can't even begin to guess what the designers were thinking when they built the nwn lap h16 I can also tell you about our sponsor bitdefender bitdefender premium security keeps your devices safe and protects you against cyber threats protect your online presence today and check them out at the link down below right out of the gate the product page for the nwn lap notebook 16.0 inch is about four miles of laughably inaccurate information starting with the price we paid 385 US dollars for this thing but we have no idea what the real price is somewhere in the week between it arriving in our office and US writing this script the price almost doubled to 660 dollars then a day later it dropped below what we paid to 375. then there's the fact that I have never heard of nwn lap it seems like what they've done is put their sticker on the bottom of a machine that is actually from Deke which explains everything no actually that explains nothing who the heck is Deke I've never heard of them either the only information I could find on Google is this company profile on ec21 that introduces Deke as a laptop OEM slash odm with the most excellent circuit design according to this page they have between 50 and 100 employees in Shenzhen China and they were established in 2011 but then according to this same page the last time they logged in was 10 years ago so this information could be out of date no worries I'll just click through to their website and oh let's take a closer look at the included sleeve and the other free gifts that's pretty sleevy oh you know what's funny it's mouse pad material it's just sewn together I have to know now though is there like a rubberized backing on the inside of this oh you know what no I don't need to bring out my keys because I have my Jerry rig everything now for Bill Boyle ttstore.com no no the sleeve is a denser foam and it has a different backing on it [Music] it includes a gaming mouse 3D gaming mouse this is no two-dimensional Mouse we also get a usb2 ethernet adapter but don't expect it to be a very impressive one this is wait what does this thing work really half of the contacts in the RJ45 Port are missing it's only fast ethernet which by today's standards is not fast megabytes per second is what you're going to get one of these and then your final free gift is some orange keycaps for your gaming keys on the left we've got a whole lot of nothing on the rear we've got USBC mini HDMI an AC and Barrel Jack and a USB a there's another usba over on the right along with a Micro SD slot it's nice I like to see that a headphone jack and a webcam storage slot now hold on a minute that's right this is an idea that I actually pitched ages ago Backlund Asus was dumping webcams from all their gaming laptops it's a magnetic webcam and it actually uses magnets and these Pogo pins to attach to the top of the display no need for a notch no need for a cutout or a big tall upper bezel ah these guys must watch LTT and what's really cool cool is if you weren't nwn lap and you were able to build out an ecosystem of accessories here you could put other stuff there like a better microphone or uh um okay I don't have too many ideas but definitely a webcam You Gotta Give Them credit the Aesthetics aren't really any worse than any other gaming laptop these days I've seen laptops that cost twice this much with more chassis Flex than this has it's pretty rigid uh let's go ahead and turn that I really hope this display gets a little bright hey yeah not bad and the display is one of the Highlight features of this machine it's advertised as a golden ratio display and what that means is that it uses a 16 by 10 aspect ratio and you know what this is one of the things that I feel is absolutely a fair marketing point for this product 16 by 10 is so much better for anyone who can make use of a little bit of extra vertical space be you a writer an Avid Reader a video editor it's like that many more tracks that many more lines of text it's freaking awesome it's also an IPS type matte panel with good if decidedly last gen viewing angles and brightness like man if all I wanted was a big fat 16 by 10 I mean it's 60 hertz but like for for under 400 bucks for the whole machine wait what do you mean you can't find my camera come on oh my God this mouse is can you hear the sound it makes [Laughter] just do it a bunch of times well that's unfortunate I guess my idea is not as good as I thought uh one idea we have is to try to pull out the pins a bit yes no this seems pretty good to me too hi just uh checking out the oh crap well not every one of my ideas is good in practice that says staying in there as it is oh boy I mean I guess it kind of stays the screen looks great cannot emphasize that enough wait a minute these aren't speakers at all they are purely decorative oh no okay where's the sound actually coming from they're coming from the bottom at least they're stereo and they do not sound very good however they get loud enough and are clear enough that I don't think that watching just random content is gonna be a huge problem what about the keyboard it's a green axis mechanical keyboard with what they're calling multi-gear backlighting to let your fingers dance they appear to be using a replica of the chalk is Kale's low profile line I mean remember when kale was the rip-off switch company how the turntables have turned the feel got a pretty mixed reaction around the office but most people had their expectations happily exceeded once they heard the price as for me there are little mushier than they could be I'm definitely detecting some inconsistency between the keys this has hands down the best keyboard I've ever seen on a laptop under 500 not even looking close new standard of entry-level laptop keyboard if all you need to do is type this thing might actually come away from this with a recommendation there are some quirks for some reason three of the function keys all have exactly the same function see this brightness down one it doesn't go down it just Cycles through all the brightness levels but there are some things the keyboard does right even when it comes to functionality for example it has function keys to turn off the backlight of the display and to disable the touchpad the trackpad is not big by modern keyboard standards especially for a 16 inch device but it is surprisingly usable two-handed which a lot of the time can have issues with lower end laptops where the Palm rejection will kick in and it won't work and it's perfectly responsive I man I was expecting to just dunk on this thing and I actually kind of like it whoa shut up it has fingerprint login and it works and who are we sending our fingerprints to actually on that subject it's time to explore our Windows installation and things are about to get a lot weirder the writer for this video has a list of four strange changes that have been made to the stock Windows install and I'm supposed to see how many of them I catch here that poor CPU at a hundred percent opening up task manager that's a little rough Celeron now that's a name I've not heard in a long time but we got 16 gigs of RAM 2400 megahertz is this DDR3 it is ddr4 it's just really slow ddr4 who even still makes 24 and wait am I am I out of touch here is 2400 ddr4 slow it's slow right like that's really slow right this is a 10 nanometer chip this is not old launched in q1 of 2021 this is a 10 watt chip should it be obvious okay I give up what is it that's not Default about the desktop here so that you can't move an icon where you want it to it always goes to the end of the list interesting now this isn't like oh phone home you know weird hackery nonsense or anything but it does indicate that they have absolutely made changes to windows before shipping it with this machine now this is something I should have checked right away how on Earth is this licensed it just doesn't say that's not how we hold now hold on just a gosh darn minute here no no I've got the best laptop everything about this appears to be completely normal this is activated using my organization's activation service okay can I get updates these lights here which I assumed were for like num lock and caps lock and stuff uh appear to be purely decorative I can get updates I'm afraid I'm not gonna find the weird stuff about this thing hit me with it what's weird I I can't figure it out oh okay okay what what else is there you missed the batch file which one this one oh wait whoa okay hold on just a gosh darn minute here okay there's a win 10 JH batch file here that I accidentally started for a second there uh we're gonna go ahead and open this in notepad I see a lot of product keys oh okay do we know what this is doing their Windows activation got it oh my God this is hilarious look at this error handling the defined key is not found haha product activation successful sorry failure the last kind of quirky thing we noticed is the way that they partitioned the boot Drive we've got a 200 gig partition for Windows and then a 150 and then a 125. why they did this I don't know because there hasn't been a real benefit since the days of slow mechanical drives when you could Short Stroke your drive by creating your operating system partition just using the area of the disk around the outside where the sequential read speeds were higher on ssds it's everything's kind of stored all over the nand flash so it just doesn't matter the performance might not be as bad as you might think this CPU apparently has a reflex of 2.9 gigahertz Intel calls it the burst frequency not to be confused with Boost frequency let's see what kind of frequency it'll hit when we're actually running a sustained load four cores 2.5 gigahertz I mean I've been happy to have this in a laptop five years ago that's four real cores I gotta say I'm coming around on this thing other other than the sketchy operating system which I would absolutely remove and reformat before I connect this to my home network for example it's kind of an okay machine for the price let's open it up and have a look at what's inside this Beast please tell me that this is an m.2 upgrade slot that is so cool the SSD is a little less awesome it's got an e-paint extension on it not half of this SSD has no SSD on it you guys ready yeah I have no idea what's in here but whatever it is is definitely interesting it's about 50 mechanical keyboard machines aluminum chassis that is a very small battery it was also 5 000 milliamp hours do we know what the voltage of this battery is okay hold on Andy uh what is the voltage of this battery 7.6 that is super weird it's probably fine for a 10 watt CPU but not the kind of capacity you'd expect in a 16 inch chassis what else we got going on here perfectly adequate heat pipe cooling solution better than you'd find on many MacBooks these days actually they call this hurricane cooling is there Denzel Washington in here somewhere the motherboard is extremely small which makes sense given that this is a class of processor that you would normally find in like a netbook class product uses an Intel Wi-Fi chipset though where's my weird off-brand Wireless chipset should we game on it let's do it the product marketing features a lot of gaming imagery all right let's open up with cs go more like CS slow oh it defaulted to high oh my God 8X msaa was enabled oh not promising we're getting a stuttery 15 frames per second this is all low technically the game is running I did manage to get a kill there a second ago you know it's smoothing out a little bit though oh wow yeah I'm running at 2560 by 1600. like it looks great when the frames render if it was me in high school I'd be like heck yeah I can play the game what about gentian though they claim you get 50 FPS in this game because this is not 50 FPS I can tell you that much it's also not as bad as I thought it was going to be though oh but our render resolution is at 0.6 so it's not that it's more like 1080p everything but crowd density is minimum yeah this is not as fast as oh that's not good it's not at 50 FPS certainly not when the action gets heavier but once again it's playable and personally I think I'd rather play on something like this with a nice big screen than on a little tiny mobile device I can't recommend this machine because of some of the sketchy things that we observed particularly this installation of windows but the reality of it is that brand new I have never seen anything that comes even close to the value proposition of it especially for certain use cases like if I was a writer for example it's kind of mind-blowing there are some other options if you don't mind buying used we'll have a couple of them linked down below flashing a couple on screen right now but other than that I just have never seen this kind of value in a laptop so I guess good job deak or nwn lap or whoever you are and good job me for telling you about our sponsor manscaped
