continuing its march to take over the tech world usbc is getting an upgrade to handle up to 240 watts which is enough to power most of the gadgets you use every day it's an awesome feature but it's also a little confusing so let's break down how exactly this works what devices will use it and how to know if your electronics are compatible the main reason that the usb implementers forum wanted to bump the max power delivery from 100 watts to 240 watts is to get closer to a world of near universal charging for consumer electronics 100 watts is more than nearly any phone would need but as usb-c charging grill was more popular on laptops that 100 watt limit rules it out for higher powered machines such as gaming laptops and mobile workstations that designers and engineers use usbc can even be used to power laptop docks and monitors but that 100 watts again simply isn't enough for larger displays either that means the upgrade to 240 watts will be good news for a huge number of everyday people not just folks who have ever had a laptop charger break or go missing but also those who have had a hard time getting a new one in a pinch because of the huge number of incompatible charging tips out there i mean there are so called universal chargers with over a dozen interchangeable tips included and even those won't fit in every laptop ask me how i know that but what do you need to take advantage of this new standard well this is where it gets a little tricky you can't just send 240 watts of power down any old usbc cable part of the reason for this is that the new usb power delivery specification that allows for such high wattages works by bumping up the maximum voltage to 48 volts while keeping the 5 amps of current the same and if you remember from high school physics that volts times amps equals watts 48 times 5 is 240. we'll tell you why voltage is important right after we thank jackery for sponsoring this video their explorer 1500 portable power station has enough juice to keep all of your devices powered and connected it's huge 1500 watt hour capacity and 1800 watt output rate allow up to seven devices to be plugged in simultaneously and it only takes four hours to recharge from zero to eighty percent check out the explorer 1500 at the link below and get ten percent off with code linus tech tips so back to talking about power when you use higher and higher voltages you increase the risk of electrical arcing that can damage equipment now this isn't a big deal when connecting a cable or while it's plugged in but when you go to unplug it that's when arcing can cause a serious hazard this means that 241 usb-c cables have to be engineered differently so that cord you got three years ago isn't going to work the good news is that older usb-c cables are being deprecated or phased out but this is obviously going to take some time so what should you look for well the usb inflamers forum was nice enough to come out with official logos for cables that can support 240 watts of power which should make your search a little easier but be wary that you'll need to pay attention to determine the data transfer speeds of course the chargers themselves also need to support the new standard and there's an official logo for that too keep in mind these logos are probably going to be on the packaging and not on the cables themselves so don't go rooting around with a pile of bare cables or loose chargers in the bargain bin and expect whatever you pull out to work but if you don't see those logos anywhere remember that the usb implementers forum is officially referring to these cables and chargers as extended power range or epr so if you see these letters on a cable or charger that you're looking at you're probably good to go and of course the ports on the device you're actually trying to power need to support the new spec too so look out for usb power delivery 3.1 which is part of the usb type-c 2.1 spec just to make it all nice and confusing the spec is very new so don't expect to see tons of compatible cables chargers and laptops on the market just yet and there will be some devices that even this new usb revision won't be powerful enough to charge such as those really beefy tank-like gaming laptops that have multiple chargers they're not going to work with a single cable but as the usb-c standard becomes more and more capable the hope is that in the near future basically any contemporary corridor charger will power whatever portable gadget you have and full power usbc wall sockets might even become a common thing as a result until then though make your own labels thanks for watching like dislike check out some of our other videos maybe something on usb type c or charging or maybe um oh what's the gallium nitride that's cool and uh don't forget to comment below with video suggestions and uh subscribe and follow
