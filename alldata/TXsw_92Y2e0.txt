oh Merry Christmas guess what I got you nothing the win show Welcome everybody we've got a lot of great stuff to talk about today John carmack's decade in VR is over as he exits from reality Labs formerly Oculus uh this actually broke last week right before the show uh so we didn't really get a chance to talk about it but we're going to talk about it this week instead oh this is a big one this is actually the title topic of the show today we got an update from Microsoft on our Windows modern standby video where we basically went you guys are ruining Windows laptops with this standby issue where the battery just drains for no reason what the heck is going on over there and we actually apparently raised some hell over at Microsoft and Alex from our team managed to get on the phone with the VP of Windows platform and services to go over some of our questions so we're going to be talking about that call what is going on over there what it is that they're going to do about it got a whole big update for you guys what else we got I thought the LastPass breach was in the dock but I oh I can't find it but we're probably gonna talk about that anyways because it's interesting and also uh we have three rapid fire topics today one is yuffie admits they lied one is NVIDIA ends game stream recommends steam link and another one is facial recognition used to Bar a lawyer from entering a venue and the reason why I'm listing all of these is because some amount of them are written by chat GPT wait all the rapid fires are written by chat GPT some amounts and you are gonna have to guess which ones are written by chat GPT oh no and which ones are written by our team I will say they have been slightly massaged to like fit the format of how we normally do but there are lots of like whole sentences and stuff that are taken directly from chat GPT wild okay so you're gonna have to figure out which ones or how many whatever we'll figure it out when we get there but okay foreign hold on no no it's fine I'll just set it to public and then they will see the rest of it later let's see [Music] the show is brought to you by vessey Footwear and two other things that were there before see Sonic and Zoho one yes um hold on a second this should go ah yes there we go properly unlisted it great let's jump right into our headline topic for the day which is of course that Alex managed to get the VP of Windows platform and services on the phone to go over some of our concerns about Windows modern standby first of all I want to give Microsoft credit because on the one hand yeah they've clearly sat on an ass on this issue for well years at this point but on the other hand now that we have raised it as a problem now that the community has spoken and made their voices heard that this is a problem that affects them day to day they appear to be taking it really seriously so let's start with kind of Alex's interview um and go from there first Alex asked why is S3 sleep being removed from the boss of laptops oh no we should give the people a bit of a catch you up if you didn't catch the original video did you watch the video okay so Windows modern standby or S zero sleep is a connected type of sleep that is meant to replace the traditional S3 sleep it's supposed to be connected more power efficient and generally a boon it's been brought about in no small part by Intel's push for a more smartphone like experience on Windows laptops uh the problem is that a lot of the time when the machine is sleeping I mean I'm sure you've encountered this have you ever come to your laptop found it to be piping hot with a dead battery after you folded it and put it in your bag yes I also have like I'll try to put my desktop to sleep all right separate issue okay yeah I don't want to talk about that before now uh oh oh I I left it in the camera then um so we basically came out and said we think we figured this out we think it's to do with some kind of it seems like high performance machines are disproportionately affected so it's it's something that the machine can be churning away on while it's supposed to be sleeping we figured out that by disabling the network connected aspect of this type of sleep on a Mac we were able to we were able to get rid of that behavior which we have also seen on a Mac not even an Intel Mac right interesting so it's just it's just a weird it's a weird Quirk of of this type of sleep State um and we basically made a video calling out Microsoft saying hey this has been a problem for literally years this cannot be because you already suffer from worse battery life compared to your main competitor Apple who is gaining market share in the mobile computer space you've got to deal with this because it it is is killing the experience of using a Windows laptop yeah like I talked to someone like Jake and I'm sitting here I'm sorry you charge your laptop like once a week that's impossible for me because half the time I go to grab my laptop it feels it's probably not half but it it feels like every time I go to grab my bloody laptop I might as well flip a coin for whether I'm going to have any battery left you can go somewhere without a cable you might as well not even brought the laptop exactly yeah exactly so we were trying to light a fire at Microsoft and it seems like it worked so the first thing Alex asked was why is S3 sleep being removed from the bios of laptops because that's the problem is you couldn't even just say look I don't want s0 I want S3 when there's this industry move towards eliminating S3 so here's the answer Microsoft is moving away from S3 sleep because how each device goes be because how each device goes to sleep is controlled by that device's firmware that means for a device to sleep properly the firmware needs to be updated and maintained by the company that made said device and as you can probably guess that doesn't happen all the time big problem with Windows being put on so many different things by using S zero sleep instead Microsoft has more control over sleep and has a much higher success rate of everything going to sleep properly and waking up properly compared to S3 sleep and I have to admit I was wondering too well what was the problem with S3 sleep but then again I also know back to your desktop comment that there are plenty of problems with S3 sleep yeah like say for example disabling wacon mouse or wacon keyboard in the Bios and yet having it magically wake up if you so much as bump your mouse anyway or just wake up randomly yeah right I had this thing for a while where I had to put it to sleep three times every time it would just wake back up again like five minutes later and then I could finally get it to go down and I had a lot of people comment on this video why don't you just shut down your computer why don't you just shut down your computer if it's an advertised feature of the product no you don't get to complain about me complaining about it that is a problem that is objectively a problem and I don't want to hear it so so what you turn off your computer I don't give it but if the computer is supposed to go to sleep I am well within my right to expect that it will go to sleep okay it's like a child right the child is supposed to go to sleep so if it doesn't go to sleep well you're well within your right to yell at it and Shake It obviously kidding obviously kidding I'm trying my legal advice I'm trying to make it so people don't take me too seriously when I'm going all around because some people can't tell the difference okay all right and I also think sometimes it's like the backing into parking spaces things like you might have a lot of time when you are done using said device but you might know that the next time that you have to start using it you're going to need to use it quickly but you don't want to just let it sit there running the whole time and I get to sleep I get that your needs might not be the same as mine but that doesn't make them the only valid needs that too and I'm not saying that your way shouldn't be supported that's the thing I'm not saying well everyone should shut down yeah you shouldn't shut down I'm saying you should be able to do both we should have Choice like say for example there's a lot of really great feedback recently about the Micron um facilities tour okay did you watch by any chance no but it's easy it's in my watch later yeah it's really good yeah tons of comments basically this is the best video you guys have ever done this is Far and Away the best factory tour I've ever seen it's a really good video Micron was amazing they really opened up allowed us to see not just see but use the facilities I made Ram I said that I saw that thumbnail and immediately added it to my watch later I made Ram it was so cool well here's the thing I can't did we just lose power yep how much UPS do we have over here uh we need to we need to get power from the main server room UPS let's freaking go uh we have three minutes okay how much uh okay uh Luke entertain the people okay uh I don't think we're live though sing a song we're live we are live uh okay uh wait no yeah we're back hello hi uh it is nighttime on the land show now with Luke how's it going Dan uh who usually sits back there behind the TV which I guess you guys don't see but it's also behind the camera uh pretty much said three minutes got up and ran uh and Linus also got up and ran we have lost power uh both of them are off trying to solve the problem I'm still not 100 certain if it's live people are saying f I think we're still sending some data I'm not 100 sure what's going on but assuming that this is going to someone right now I'm just gonna I'm just gonna keep going uh there's UPS is beeping all around the building I'm not 100 certain what you guys can hear but we have one very large UPS in the server room uh that I think they are going to try to work on I suspect uh if I had to make some assumptions but they are going to be shutting down certain things that are running off of that UPS system to try to keep networking and what not going as long as possible so that we can keep the stream going I do believe that is the plan although I can hear them talking right now so theoretically they will be coming back soon um I don't know should I give you guys spoilers no I can't because then you guys will post them in chat and let us know which ones are which ones are real and which ones are fake so I won't I won't go through that I don't think I can really complete this um sleep topic so I might jump into another one I think the one that I'm going to do is the LastPass topic uh because if this stream is going out to no one that is probably the most okay one to do because there are no notes for it in the dock oh do not call me hello uh just all the lights coming on what's a good time oh right so this isn't UPS running this we just got power back this is UPS okay yeah should we turn this off yeah just go for it you're fine there's extreme circumstances yeah we can just have a nightwind show it's fine directly through the notes legendary programmer John Carmack known for programming the original Doom uh and his love for VR has stepped down as Consulting CTO for reality Labs formerly Oculus actually didn't know they were called reality Labs I don't know why I didn't know that yeah I think that was a while back yeah I probably just didn't care because it's a weird name change that doesn't matter uh meta is famous for making and directing and directly breaking promises not to F it up in quotes you will not need a Facebook account to use or develop for the rift that's definitely not a thing anymore quotes we are not going to track you flash ads at you or do anything invasive uh that's not a thing anymore in quotes we are going to we are not going to lock people out because they compete I actually didn't know that was broken but apparently that was broken in 2016. uh yeah and then another one in quotes Facebook is going to give us access to massive resources but let us operate independently hey the first part they did if anything I think the entire investing world quadrupled uh hexto pulled down yeah the first yeah the first half of that is extremely correct um and then in quotes none of our gaming resources will be diverted oh yeah that one uh not so much oof uh CarMax says that he has mixed feelings about leaving stating that the Quest 2 in particular was almost exactly what he wanted to see despite complaints about the software yeah the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back is apparently the the gaming resources being diverted one for him I mean we know yeah John Carmack he's a gamer he's not again he's not a gamer oh he's not a game he's not into gaming right right John Carmack not that into gaming just a doom yeah it's not a game yeah yeah it's a wall it's real it's a wall painting it's how we protect the world from demons you know the storyline behind Doom is like surprisingly in depth yeah it's like there's a ton of lore yeah I had no idea yeah me neither anyway um Carmack has previously been critical of meta's Direction saying that they should focus on products to tap into the metaverse before building out initiatives uh he worried that thousands of people's efforts spending years would be spent on things that didn't contribute to the way people use devices today seems to be a little bit true his biggest problem however is the efficiency and speed of development he says that as someone who works hard at optimization seeing gross inefficiency hurts your soul likening to seeing five percent GPU utilization that is not surprising from him he has always been hyper into that this is one of the reasons why people still run some of his old games on like as many devices as they can possibly imagine because they're really really well built for for optimization for regard like basically regardless of what platform you're on reality Labs he says operates at half the effectiveness that he'd like yikes that's a big hoop I mean his standards are pretty high yes but there's probably still room for improvement also yes his voice at the top of the company to his dismay has not been able to persuade the organization to improve he says uh that he has never been able to stop stupid things because they cause damage or set a direction and have the team stick to it he blames himself for this as instead of taking a leadership role and locking horns with Facebook on day one he focused on what he's best at programming that's also not surprising he assumed he would hate it be bad at it and probably lose anyways so that's why he stuck to programming he still deeply believes in VR and that meta is best able to show its value his parting advice in quotes is make better decisions and fill your products with give a damn now CarMax Focus yeah me too actually CarMax Focus will be on his artificial intelligence startup Keen Technologies which has received significant investment money in recent months artificial intelligence or AGI has the goal of making an artificial intelligence system that can theoretically do any task a human can a truer definition of AI what we call AI right now is far more limited in scope and off and is often just a matter of observe and fail at one thing until it gets better some like meta Chief scientist Yan Li Kun hopefully I said that right I don't know sorry if I did say that wrong uh doubt that AGI can or will ever become a reality others fear what AGI could represent if created irresponsibly the AI overloads overlords joke hits a little differently for AGI now what I kind of want to raise here uh is I think AI or AGI or whatever is what a lot of people definitely including myself thought VR was going to be at this point in time sure yep I think it's a huge disrupter I think it's going to change a ton of things I think it already has and the real usable levels of it have barely even existed yet um like when gpt4 comes out uh if places like Google who have large language models similar to gp3 gpt4 whatever if they start using those more publicly if other companies that have similar systems start using those more publicly I think the impact of these things are going to be on the scale uh that when Oculus was first founded people thought the impact of VR was going to be at so I think it is a much more significantly interesting thing to work on right now and I think Carmack is is quite interested in leading his own things considering that the vast amount of his frustrations very clearly when leaving meta um was leadership decisions sure and and efficiencies and goals and all that type of stuff so if he can steer the ship more directly and he can do it on something that might be more Punchy and more fun right now this is one of those things where I've I think I've talked to you about this like not on the show just talking um I don't know how I would handle working for someone else yeah as long as they made decisions that I agreed were really great it'd be fine yeah and it's not going to be fine I I I think it's really hard to and the thing is that I like to think that I try pretty hard to reach consensus when we make a decision as a company um I have never experienced that anywhere else and I suspect that is not very common and I suspect that even as I'm talking about this and you're sitting there nodding I'm not always perfect at it um but no but there's a reason I'm still here too I don't know I just I don't think I would I don't think I would find I wouldn't need to agree with everything but I don't think I would find a place where I would agree with enough and I think that's basically what he's run into here I've said this literally on the WAN show before like I don't necessarily agree with everything we've ever done but I think that would be basically impossible um and it's fine and I think I I do agree with the vast majority of things that we've done [Music] um I might want to give her a little more juice way less than I thought uh hey all right good enough nice I do agree with the vast majority of things that we've done and even when I don't agree with what we've done I can usually at least see the logic behind it I have worked places before where tons of things happen where no matter how hard I try I can't find the logic behind it uh the logic behind why the show is dark today by the way if you guys are joining us a little bit late here we're going to try to splice together the the segments of the show but we were interrupted by a power outage we are going to run on battery for as long as we can here guys but the show might be a little bit on the

haha like me also they're 100 vegan so get 25 off each pair with offer code when show you can check them out at bessie.com I've actually been wearing them quite a bit lately I I forgot to buy new sandals so our brother is too lazy to buy new sandals for kind of an extended period and so I started like wearing the vessies and it's a heart-to-heart habit to break yeah they're like they're all right you know my girlfriend bought vessies without realizing that they were a sponsor of us no I don't think so and she I didn't know that she even had them and she was talking about how much she liked her shoes because no water got through them and I was like oh we have a sponsor that makes like highly water resistant shoes they're called vesi and she's like oh I have vessies I was like what small world how did this happen but yeah it's actually that's actually a true story what do you want to talk about uh I want to get through these rapid fire topics because I want to see if you can sniff out which one of them was written by uh by chat GPT so for do you want me to read them and you can read through the notes and think about it like we normally would you know I'll do one you do one let's get through all three of them sure and then I'll do my best okay first up we've got yuffie admits they lied this has been a developing story over man like a month now hasn't it in a blog post addressed to yuffie security customers and partners anchor the parent company of yuffie admitted to using the cloud to send mobile push notifications with small preview images which are protected by end-to-end encryption and deleted shortly after being sent okay the company also admitted to a security flaw in the live view feature on its web portal but denied that any user data had been exposed or that facial recognition data was sent to the cloud yuffie has made changes to the feature to require users to log into the web portal in order to view live streams or share active links to them the company stated that it is committed to reducing the use of the cloud in its security processes wherever possible and that it complies with all industry standards discussion question here is how much does an incident like this really tarnish a brand or its bottom line I well I don't know it depends how mainstream is a lot yeah well I think it depends how mainstream the reporting on the negativity surrounding it is how much competition there is in the space like you can talk day in and day out about what a toxic company NVIDIA might be or apple might be and it's not going to stop people from buying their products absolutely yeah whereas yuffie I feel like what did not have as strong of a brand to begin with and so much of the strength of their brand at least based on the messages I'm seeing about it was around that promise that they didn't upload anything to the cloud so yeah I could see it I could see it being extremely damaging and there's quite a few competitors and there's competitors that are bigger names so like this this could be a hugely negative kind of an underdog yeah um our second discussion question is if you became CEO of this company one week before the revelations I hope the AI wrote this discussion question because this is a great discussion question I suspect it was James who wrote this discussion question I think I think but I don't remember I think all the discussion questions okay might be people I had a meeting with Riley and James this week about sort of um because we added Luke and I added a bunch of topics to the doc right before the show went live last week and Riley sent me the world's saddest email it was pretty sad being like you know we work really hard on things on these topics I would be really nice to know if you're just like would prefer other topics and I'm like oh Riley I'm sorry it's not you it's me um let's have a meeting next week and kind of talk about why we changed them and one of the things that wasn't just like me laying down an edict or whatever but one of the things that came out of our discussion you're a genius Jake he's got a um a jackery yeah speaking of sponsor there's five we're streaming one sure let's go um like Triple O's on the show heck yeah Jake all right um wait what were we talking about now right yeah so one of the things we came to together was that part of choosing a good topic is looking at what the discussion topics will be because if the discussion topic is is this bad yeah yes then there's nothing to really talk about yeah it's bad we need some back and forth okay well but why is it bad how is it bad who was bad where was it badly we've got to be able to there's got to be something discussion in the discussion question yeah and so what I'm noticing is our discussion topics are our discussion questions are so much better because I think we're choosing topics based on how rich the discussion can be yeah if you wanted to truly make things right if you were the CEO of this company one week before this happened so you can't you can't alter course all you can do is react to it what would you have done differently so I actually vaguely referenced this on the last show that we talked about yuffie which I don't think was our last show I think it was two shows ago or something and this might like tank the company um but what I said was they effectively had to recall devices and I I still kind of defend it and yeah it might take the company I don't know but like they advertised on local only it is not local only they are not going to be able to change the I maybe you can I doubt it I don't think they're gonna be able to change that certainly not immediately so they need to like so maybe another option is offer full refunds like send out an email explaining everything that's going on be very transparent admit the things you got to admit offer a full refund and if the user doesn't take it they don't take it but like so the the the CEO in me would be trying to avoid a full we refund everything yeah um so I think I think you have to do the office that's kind of the end yeah you just tank the whole yeah you might as well just say see you later yeah um at that point and I don't mean like as an Fu to the customers that that would be the right thing to do I mean you just might not survive it yeah there's you just spent so much money on R D you spent so much money on tooling you spent so much money on manufacturing you spent so much money on shipping yeah now you have to pay for more shipping yeah to take it all back didn't gain anything yep so so what I would be trying to do is offer that option because you kind of have to yeah but I would be trying to come up with a more compelling option yeah that doesn't hurt me quite so much yeah right so I might be looking at okay if I can convince you to keep this in its current state and I can send you the new working one when we get there yeah can we do that or I would be looking for I don't know if there's a subscription but maybe you give them six months for free if I if I could if I could keep this in its in its state for now but I could get you to what we promised in six months can you accept that I'd be trying to look for because ultimately right what the customer wanted was that product yeah so I what what I would be trying to figure out is is there any way without taking back everything to get you what you paid for well there's there is some problems with that dude I know but you already broke the trust yeah so you have to throw in a bonus because you have to do more than just get there's some technical problems with that too for sure getting notifications local phones or uh remote phones all this type of stuff but for sure but I I understand the the core idea of what you're saying but I'd be trying to look for a way to kind of go okay it's gonna take us some time we're gonna have to do this to make it up to you uh some kind of partial refund or some kind which is often not actually possible like uh you ran into this a little while ago where you were not able to issue someone a partial refund through PayPal because it had been 180 days they requested far past a reasonable date yeah yeah and PayPal literally wouldn't allow Luke to do it because I guess the Assumption from their point of view is that it must be under duress I don't know yeah I mean yeah I I think their thing is they they don't want to deal with because I think if you if I remember correctly if you do a refund within the terms yeah the fees and what not get refunded as well right and there can be accounting challenges for everyone up and down the chain right because if you have already remitted the taxes you collected let me tell you something the state of California ain't going to be giving you back those taxes you remitted no matter who you refunded whatever you refunded to yeah so there's challenges of eating it yeah well I mean even if you just eat it the reporting for that would be a nightmare I don't even know how you would account for it right so it's a nightmare so yeah I'd be trying to look for a compromise uh but I agree with you you don't have a choice you have to offer the option you have to do something you have to offer the option and a bunch of people are going to take it but if you are sincere and you are open and this time you're honest you might have a solid amount of people yep that don't run but they didn't do that they've taken too long and honestly this response seems kind of half-baked as far as I'm concerned someone just needs to sue the trash out of them I I just I they're they're not going to be successful Chinese company oh what are they gonna do yeah fair enough nothing like China's going to protect their own get them banned from selling and yeah so so States or something yeah and so I just I I just uh from from my point of view anchors on our list at this point which is unfortunate we really enjoyed working with them actually I really like the anchor I genuinely like the products um me too so like it sucks because finding good long-term sponsor Partners is not something that's easy and I feel like for I feel for the poor sales team here right because when I just rug pull them and I go hey yeah that account that you've been handling that's doing however many thousands of dollars a year guess what you're not working with them anymore by Edict of the king like that sucks right oh it does yeah absolutely like imagine you worked in sales somewhere right uh your your boss comes into the room and says yeah certain quotas and all this type of stuff yeah that that car that's on the lot you can't sell that car anymore yeah or like you you can't work with uh you know I don't know families anytime a family walks on the lot you can't sell to them anymore or whatever it is right I just let them walk by I got quotas to hit right that sucks so let me do my job that's just the way it's gonna have to be though I think I just don't see a way out for us we can't in good conscience continue to work with them we have to have standards the way out of this topic though is transitioning into Nvidia Ending game stream and recommending steam link which was really weird and surprising to me yeah Nvidia has announced that it will be ending its Shield TV game stream feature in February 2023. in response users have expressed frustration and disappointment with some arguing that the steam link app recommended by Nvidia as an alternative is just not as good for example some users have reported that steam link has lower quality video less responsive controls or slower speeds compared to game stream others have complained that the app's interface or the need to purchase a separate device to use it now separate device I mean you already needed an Nvidia Android device to use Game stream so I don't know if I really buy that one because you can install Steam link on a shield to be fair I think it's a separate device compared to what oh I see yeah yeah so I don't agree with that however I do think that nvidia's investment into game stream was um a real one and a good one it was a good product it was one that I personally was very enthusiastic about and I've used steam link and they're right it's not as good it just I want steam link to be great um but it's just not there there are alternative options like moonlight that's dependent on game stream oh is it really I thought it just used the encoder I didn't think it actually piggybacked on gamestream I'm not 100 certain in in my completely independent of writing this article research I heard that it's dependent on gamestream oh that sucks right now due to the power issues we're having uh we don't actually have chat these local laptops do not have internet at all yeah so we're we're working on that but uh for now we got nothing so I can't I can't look into any of this and I can't see what you guys are saying but uh some have suggested using Sunshine which is a game stream host for moonlight as an alternative do I have a SIM tool I do I know we should have it have at least three hours three hours let's go there's a jackery plugged into the UPS a 20 amp plug because it has a 20 amp plug of course it does uh shout out shout they didn't sponsor the WAN show today but they might as well have shout out Zachary for like sending us a new jackery every time we do any kind of work with them so we just have this pile of jackeries that we keep charged in the event of an emergency with good reason and are now using which is amazing oh you can use your phone yeah my phone has internet so perfect I'm keeping it away from the cables because there's crazy feedback that comes through but whatever cool um because Moonlight uses Nvidia gamestreams nvidia's game stream protocol it is unclear if it will still work after the Midfield area update so it might work might but maybe not forever or it might just not God we have we have no idea a petition this isn't going to work a petition on change.org has been created to try to reverse the decision to shut down game stream um the petition itself isn't going to work at all uh maybe pressure in general tourism video will do something but no no one has cared about petitions since the internet started um yeah so it's just a thing uh yeah which is unfortunate to be clear we're not saying it should be that way it just hasn't seemed to have any kind of effect if you really want to get a company's attention I would say that a hundred tweets to their corporate handle is going to be a hundred times more effective than 10 000 signatures on a change.org petition especially if you get a bunch of people to do it at a very similar time so you can get it to Trend or something like that or and and at its at a time over an extended period of time you need this to because the thing is you can't rely on just the the low level uh customer interaction layer it has to make it past them into middle management into upper management and an upper manager has to hear it from multiple sources before they will even begin to consider it and it has to still be going because if it's star and then it dies off before it hits that level yes the person at that level is just going to go look it it's already over yes it's fine this is clearly resolved yeah so if you are upset you have to make noise you have to continue to make noise and then you have to not stop making noise and you have to hope a lot of other people are doing the same thing yeah if you're by yourself it's not going to accomplish much I mean from I man I see this in a number of different ways I haven't touched game stream in a long time I was just going to say I have three shields in my house and I haven't touched it as much as this sucks it might ultimately be what Nvidia needs to do as much as we just told everyone how to complain about this properly if not enough people are using it and if it's not really a driver for people to purchase their products Etc and it's this huge cost sync like companies or companies yeah and Nvidia is definitely a company oh heck yeah so like if it's there are some cost sinks that companies will keep around cough cough The Forum um that doesn't cost that much not really it's it's not a huge cost sync but yeah it definitely loses money um yeah not a ton but it's negative um but like you can't do that with everything game stream is probably a relatively complicated thing to keep updated and working with everything all the time and performant and whatnot so like I'm not happy this is going away uh and I'm sure that the people who like started the change.org petition and the people that are really angry about this are people who have heavily integrated this into their setups and that sucks yep that's the thing that's what apple is so good at they don't always have the best product but damn it that sucky product in their Walled Garden with their stupid limitations is gonna still exist in five years yep not always I mean they're uh their servers went away uh what else could I point at as I mean their professional desktops effectively went away then came back for one generation and seemed to have gone away again they're not perfect but if you buy an iPhone you can expect continuity you can expect that software for iPhone will still be an option on newer Hardware that I mean 3D touch uh you know by and large works the same way that the old one did but more better like that's some that is something that just plain sucks on the the the the the PC Android more Wild West open side of things like I okay we did a video right before the land show on this Wireless GPU okay there was a a 460 that had five antennas hanging off of it GTX 460. I got all these antennas hanging off of it has this receiver dongle that comes with it that has an HDMI out that goes into any HD display and it was meant to be an all-in-one solution for wireless display okay super cool product but if you buy into that literally design your home theater setup around it thinking I'm definitely gonna have an upgrade path for this over the next few years I'm going to integrate this into my life you're an idiot because it's not going to happen to be fair it's Nvidia I don't think Nvidia has killed a lot of their projects I can't think of it I'm sorry um yeah but the whole world physics physics was around for a long time yeah and it's technically still around but not in the form that was promised to us in totally a days ago and in the wake of the Nvidia acquisition Nvidia abandoned wears things they do they do I guess I guess my brain just keeps comparing it to Google and it's like no not really but yeah those are those are a few examples yeah the shield portable okay handheld handheld gaming consoles what happened to those one and done boom see you later now Nvidia kill stuff let's not kid ourselves fair enough fair enough um and so and so that really sucks and that's one of the reasons that smart home has how smart home technology has been such a a struggle right because there's no ecosystem that you can buy into and just hope for continuity well you can buy into it and hope but you're but it's not going to come true and so our discussion question here is to what extent does the removal of something like game stream represent a broken promise to customers of the Nvidia Shield we can use Wayback machine at this point to go look at the marketing of the shield look at how prominently Nvidia featured this particular a capability of the product in their marketing and say hey this is tantamount to outright false advertising at this point yeah and this is something that is happening more and more absolutely like a perfect example is what Google's done with their home with their Hub products and their their nest Home Products where that lawsuit from Sonos affected their ability to set up the product to such an extent that it is extremely user unfriendly now I mean you you I'm sorry but there has to be legislation put in place that says if you advertise a [ __ ] feature you don't get to take it away with an update you can't update your product to make it worse my steam deck doesn't work so I can't swear but it's like uh if the power zone is fine uh it's it's it's like the games recently as well right we talked about these games especially VR games uh there was a few of them that didn't sell super well so they just completely offlined all their servers but they're online only games and people bought them I don't even care if one person bought it yeah you advertise this game you shouldn't be able to shut down the servers like one year later that's crazy yeah that's ridiculous or you should have to as we've said so many times you should have to release the server side code yeah at the very least if nobody picks it up all right so be it yeah so be it but if you advertised a feature then I think there needs to be legislation in place your button's not working I found out um that in good faith you have to provide the community you have to give stewardship over to someone so that it can be maintained yeah and I think when it comes to software there's a vibrant enough open source community that someone would take this and run with it I don't know if they're going to run with it as well as uh the the SubCom guys but yeah there there is still there are communities outside of the uh just honestly fairly stunningly awesome Supreme Commander Community there are communities outside of that that are running old games that have become uh open source or shareware in some way and it's it's pretty cool um we have one more whoa is that intentional oh I think they're using jackeries to restore wait no this is the power on no the emergency lights I think that yeah they're using jackerys to uh to bring the lights back on oh it is back on the emergency lights are off right that should yeah okay all right all right we got this can we turn this back on yeah it might be uh hey all right it's that right there um is someone from floatplane trying to figure out getting access to these files to kind of stitch everything AJ's on it yeah AJ you are an absolute French Canadian Champion um I'm sorry I had to qualify I'm very I'm fairly certain he's got the first one coming down already all right um I don't know I don't think he's even heard at this point that we need the second one if you're watching this AJ I'm sorry but it's true all right we're gonna do our third maybe written by AI topic facial recognition was used to Bar a lawyer pun intended from entering a venue and this maybe doesn't sound like that big of a deal but it's a big deal a mother accompanying her daughter's Girl Scout Troop to a Rockettes show at Radio City Music Hall in Manhattan over the Thanksgiving weekend was denied entry after facial recognition software allegedly identified her so this is before submitting any kind of identification or ticket or anything Kelly conlon imagine doing this to a lawyer on purpose anyway Kelly conlon the woman in question works as a lawyer for a firm that is involved in a personal injury claim against um MSG entertainment the group that owns the venue she does not however practice in New York and is not involved in the particular case so Conlin claims she was approached by security and asked to produce identification after passing through the metal detectors into the main lobby a sign in the lobby does state that facial recognition technology is in use for the safety of guests and employees interesting MSG entertainment claims they have a policy that precludes attorneys pursuing active litigation against the company from attending events at our venues until that litigation has been resolved brutal absolutely brutal the heck timeline are we on Luke imagine going into uh I don't even know if these exist imagine going into an anchor one random person who's never even heard of this story that works at uh one of the companies here walking into an anchor store and being told to leave because they know that they're employed by the parent company of this company that has some kind of ongoing dispute yeah like this candle it doesn't even have to be a dispute right this can of worms is open wild imagine any uh Sonos employee was to try to use a Google service if they bought a Google home and went to set it up and it used AI voice recognition to say hey we couldn't help noticing that you're such and such from Google's Hardware division uh why don't you go f yourself and uh yeah that's pretty much it see you later absolutely Wild yeah that's crazy absolutely crazy discussion question what are your feelings about facial recognition being used to Bar people from events based on uh scraped data sets like this um when is it appropriate when is it not Where's the Line this is wow bad uh I don't know I'm I'm hot spotted uh I I can check though I'll check Jinx you owe me a ride home I I mean that was the plan um I I'm taking him for a ride in my new car yeah I haven't really talked about it yet I think that's the first one that's the Public Announcement that's the first public acknowledgment I don't know about appropriate but one thing I'm gonna throw out there is I think this might become a big thing for political events yeah oh wow because if you can keep protesters out by knowing what their affiliations are based on facial recognition pairing that with public information like Twitter accounts or whatever else yeah um and figuring out if you want to let people in uh I I think that's absolutely going to be a thing I'm not going to take a stance on what how I feel about the appropriateness of that I just see that happening I see this I see this coming down to like a supreme court tier like like free like First Amendment kind of thing in the U.S and then I suspect uh Canada is going to pull their usual thing where we basically just yeah do whatever the US does yeah we're a super cool independent country and we advance uh directly in step with the US sometimes we ignore what they do which is good um other times we ignore what they do and it's not as good yeah anywho the point is that this is I think this is headed for the Supreme Court because I think ultimately there there's going to be like um like like a personal rights argument from both sides on the one hand discriminating against someone based on their profession or their place of work seems like pretty open shot but on the other hand to tell a venue that they are that they do not have the right to refuse service to an individual customer on their own bloody property is also seems pretty open and shut right it's weird there's a strong argument both ways strong argument there's a lot of technological stuff coming out right now that the law is so far behind yes and it doesn't help that half of the legislators in the western world are set to generians as far as I can tell no idea what's going on no idea what's going on yeah and even the younger ones quite frankly could stand to be a little more tech savvy based on a lot of the C-SPAN that I've seen yep yep Okay so at least one Jake has apparently joined the show oh no he's not sitting in the producer cam so we missed him lean to the right Jake this is apparently he's here in case the uh the power goes out again things things have gotten a little hairy this is It's been a fun night my roof caved in that's a fun thing uh minutes after leaving my uh my apartment to come to work I got a call from my girlfriend saying that uh part of the ceiling had ripped through and it was raining in one of the bathrooms um we thought it was a preview a leak that we had previously found in the house that was caused by the AC it wasn't that it was the roof of the apartment building was leaking into the attic and then ripped through our ceiling so that was cool I haven't been to go I haven't been able to go help with that but she's been doing a great job Luke had to co-host a video with me before the show today uh reacting to our worst videos and he should it okay for real I'm talking talking from the heart here okay I have to commend your professionalism oh he showed up looking like an actual storm cloud like Jaw set teeth clenched pissed we turned on the camera and he's like this video is terrible classic that they were actually pretty terrible we've made some stickers over the years yeah there's one there's one that I had completely forgotten about I actually have no memory of it at all posted by Luke hosted like clearly it's it's something that I did and it's it's really bad all right wow yeah there's also a couple in there that I expected to see the uh the Blackberry one I like I did the second I heard the premise of the videos like Blackberry video Blackberry videos gonna be in there it's awful oh yeah it's terrible but yeah that'll be that'll be a fun video I have done some stuff you know I didn't feel like as a mid-20 something that my sense of humor was probably gonna change I felt like what I was doing and thought was funny then I would probably still think is funny in 10 years it's not funny we laughed at it we did but we were laughing that WD video was so funny it was not funny it was cringe yeah I guess so it was cringed so hard that it goes all the way around back to funny there's a couple comments about my birds the birds are fine um my girlfriend got the birds back into cages they're covered everything's fine um we did not include the hide your porn one I don't even think that video was that bad I think that video did okay it might be cringy like the humor is probably terrible oh um but if that is anything we've ever done I think like performance wise I think it did fine um I'll always remember the script review meeting for that because Luke wrote Some cringy Like it was his idea to have like basically a lot of the shots be you know uh suggestive right and then I think that you thought do you remember this I I not with full clarity I yeah I think that you thought I was gonna come in and tone it down and then I amped it up to the point where even you were kind of like oh this is pretty bad it honestly sounds about right yeah yeah 2.2 million views on that yeah um it's pretty good from seven years ago there's some real Tech tips in there I mean I don't know how relevant most of them are now that incognito mode and like just everything being shockingly easily accessible is the thing yeah I guess it would help it hide from you like your parents to a certain degree but incognito mode isn't really enough I know I'm pretty sure truecrypt was in there which isn't really a thing anymore um so like it's it's definitely a little dated but something like it probably useful still okay back to it though we just did Three core topics yuffie Nvidia facial recognition some amount I haven't told them how many it could be all of them it could be one it could be two some amount of them were written massaged slightly so that it fits our format a little bit better um but but written with some minor edits by chat GPT and now you need to try to identify which ones I also because I think this is important and interesting want to know why you think this for each one oh man the fact that the fact that it's this tough is very interesting okay but the fact that a human went through and massaged it that is true that is true it makes it really I don't know how much of that was done because it wasn't me uh James prepared this um I do know that he said like many of these are like full sentences like he mostly shaped it instead of changed it if that makes sense that's that's my understanding it's been a bit a lot has happened since since I talked to I think the UC one was written by chat GPT okay um that's the only one that I think for sure was written by chat GPT so you get one point you get okay no you get hold on hold on hold on okay he hasn't explained the point so I think I can still clarify further yeah I think that the Nvidia one was written by a human okay I am not sure about the facial recognition one I don't know how to give you points anymore um you got one right okay you got one wrong and you got one maybe I guess the the answer to the facial recognition one uh the facial recognition one was written by a human both of the other two are cha gbt shoot wow wow yeah yeah wow yeah wow pretty crazy eh yeah um so we we've talked about this privately and I don't have this prepared um but someone made uh I wish I wonder if I can bring it up um here I mean just so that you guys can see what the notes look like for these because that might not be something that will translate perfectly for you here's the yuffie topic what's the reason that I thought that it was chat GPT was because it was far less editorialized than some of our writers tend to uh there's there's also things like in a blog post address to yuffie security customers and partners but we'll anchor all of its properly capitalized there's a few things that can make it stop absolutely this one though the fact that it like really talked about you know what's going on around this so I will add some context yeah it wasn't done and some people on the stream will know this and I think you'll notice it wasn't done by just saying like hey summarize this link because it can't can't do that it can't crawl the web so information was given to it talking points were given to it and then it turned them into whatever so we gave it notes still yeah one of them uh James gave it I think it was like five or six links that gave it the links and like a five word blurb for each link that was the Nvidia one actually um it I wonder if I have a screenshot I don't know if I'd be able to find it uh it's in my team so I wouldn't be able to show it very effectively on stream um but just very little information but from information that is naturally in the URL of something that isn't obfuscated and the little tiny like three to five word little snippet of each post it wrote this Nvidia article wow which is like pretty good wow it was a hundred percent enough for us to go off of super super interesting um I was talking to Linus the other day about um oh this is not even the one that I found I Googled it I found a different one so more than one person has done this which is interesting should I go to your laptop um I guess I think this is what yeah you can go to it so this is a I don't know every dot T I've never heard of this before I built an AI chatbot based on my favorite podcast um this is a different person though than the one that I linked you yeah and it's not the exact same thing but it's extremely close this one looks like a command line thing whatever I don't know so the one that I had found it's an actual website that you can go to these are both based off of the huberman Lab podcast but people have take I'm assuming I have not read this article the other one I know this is how this works I'm assuming this person did it the same way they use a different open AI product yeah so they fed all of uh Dr huberman's podcasts through whisper which is another open AI product which transcribes audio to text and then they fed all of the text into gpt3 and then they made it so that you can ask the chat bot effectively questions about what Dr huberman says in his podcasts and it will go through all of the transcripts of all of these like three hour long super dance podcasts and it will pull answers out for you the other one will also cite its references wow so it'll say like I got this from this podcast at this minute and you can click on it it'll bring up the podcast at that timestamp so you can listen to the original audio just in case you don't trust the transcription this is super interesting for like a bunch of reasons this is terrifying for Content podcast industry yeah especially if you are a very information dense podcast like the Hebrew men Lab podcast uh because now people don't have to listen to your content or consume it at all these random people on the internet just made a way completely detached from your content that you have absolutely no way of being paid for nope and they made a way for people to completely bypass all of your stuff it's super helpful for users that want to pull information out of it it's super not helpful for you being able to grow your your uh your your channel continue to do your podcast continue to do it at all really so um from a copyright standpoint though man I mean it's just like the artist thing right so there's nothing inherently wrong with AI generated or machine learning generated artwork the issue is how it was trained and proper compensation for the data set that it was trained on and Luke talked about this extensively enough in last week and the week before that I don't think we need to tread over it again this week but basically there's no problem with a bot that compiles answers to questions as long as it is properly compensating whoever's original work was used to train it but as of this time that's not being done and there is no framework whatsoever for that to be done so for the same reason that artists are crying foul about their artwork being used to train their Machine replacement uh I could see a podcaster crying foul about their body of work their body of copyrighted work being used to create a tool that irrelevance their copyrighted work and I don't think you're going to be able to make a very solid fair use argument for something like this because yes for personal use you could probably make the argument that there is nothing wrong with watching all of the episodes therefore having all of the words for yourself and making those words creating an index of those words and a way to recall various words in some way right but as soon as you make it more broadly available especially commercially available yeah that falls apart to be fair all the ones that I've seen so far have not been commercially driven uh one interesting one the first one that I found and I don't know why I can't find it right now I'm sure I could if I use my Google Foo a little bit more effectively but the first one that I found uh the whole thing is open source too you put it all in GitHub and the fact that multiple people have done this already proof that it's not really that hard the person that I had looked into originally said it took them less than a day because like the the process is all kind of already there you're just sort of linking things together right we've got a couple interesting um uh viewer comments here so Eric's RC on floatplane says Linus I disagree I don't believe most people listen to podcasts Just For answers there's a definite entertainment value but this is just like what I was talking about earlier where just because you don't need to put your laptop to sleep doesn't mean that I don't so yeah this podcast I don't think anyone necessarily nobody noisy no needs to search this for information or it's unlikely but someone could yeah because we're we're going to be a secondary source a lot of the time unless you're looking for information about like my life or Luke's life or whatever else the case may be and if that's the case um probably it would be more interesting to hear it as told by us anyway yeah I think the land shows a more entertainment show anyhow and I'm not saying that because there's some kind of like liability oh advice on the windshield should be taken for entertainment purposes only it's just I I do I do think that that's the show that we try to run for you guys yeah um but that doesn't mean that every podcast is like that some of them are very q a driven very information driven and humans are extremely information driven there are also Lots there are also Lots I don't know about that one but sure but but there is a lot you're right though there is a lot of educational or informational based podcasts there's tons of science based podcasts there's tons of uh even like uh it's more about keeping up with the industry yes and less about being entertained yes right yeah and so or like imagine there's a self-help podcast sure you might look for answers to somewhat common self-help questions by using this thing whatever it is there are lots of not just like storytelling entertainment style yes thanks and so that's a that's a big challenge um and ethereal llama says isn't this part of the territory when you post free content on the internet though no no the content isn't free we've talked about this before and some people are never going to understand it but that's really just not my problem at a certain point but content isn't free there is an implicit agreement that the content is going to be supported in some way otherwise it won't exist otherwise it would explicitly be said that it is free Linus Tech tips is not free Linus Tech tips is paid for bye um buy actual money which we get from ads or from subscriptions and it is it is possible that something is free but that also does not mean that its license allows you to do this with it correct um there there is a ton of different levels of variation when it comes to licensing and you could absolutely release a podcast with a license where you allow people to do this absolutely there's nothing stopping you from doing that you could say everything that I say into this podcast is free for everyone to use in any way and no I did not just say that about wind show um but you can you could say that but I do not believe that has been said by these people but what I was going to say is a dangerous intrusive thought that comes up when I've already heard about this thing where they're taking podcasts and they're transcribing them and stuff what stops people from setting up an RSS feed of trusted news sites setting up a bot that is able to scrape the the body of an article without grabbing all the ads and the other junk that's on the page taking all of that feeding it to chat GPT getting chat GPT to rewrite it and then getting another system that they make to automatically post these actually because chat GPT is pretty good at it genuinely Rewritten articles and then they put their own ads on there and then they just put their own monetizing someone else's work yep it's all automated yep like and so you know what it's not going to completely destroy Industries in a day no maybe not even in a year give it 10 years I mean even three yeah a very that is already an entire news industry yeah but it's usually junk and if you're like paying attention pretty much at all you can usually kind of tell no you can a lot of people can't fairness is why we're but this this moves that bar up quite a bit yeah people have found a few different accounts because you can kind of prod them in the right way that people have found a few different Twitter accounts that are using AI generated faces as their profile that look extremely convincing like you can't tell especially that size at that resolution it you really can't tell um and then they have fully chat GPT written tweets and replies the whole account and the ones that I have kind of found with with advice from other people and how to find them et cetera et cetera Etc um all of the ones that I've found it looks like people are just experimenting I don't think they're really using them to any goal yet yeah but yeah it's gonna happen yeah we're headed in an interesting Direction and it's hard to find out uh larodos says what about content creators doing this themselves to search their podcasts I mean yeah we could but what I can tell you is that right now there is no like zero effective way to monetize something like this and pretty much any podcast that you know and love if it has any kind of monetization on it now if you were to say to the Creator hey why don't you use this tool where people don't have to watch the podcast you monetize and they can just get all the information that they need without watching it and you monetizing it why don't you do that they're gonna be like what why some some that like they really don't care about their podcast as a career path or whatever and they just want the information no apparently sure and again I did specify ones that are currently monetized okay yeah there you go yeah yeah pretty much um and kai-am says I mean Adblock is a thing what's your take on how this is different to that it's not what is take us on that is pretty documented yes I think I think I've been pretty clear about it uh the part that people got confused about is I never actually said never use an ad blocker what I said is own it yeah just own it yeah understand put it on your hat yeah wear your shirt yeah we've even sold this shirt yeah I like it just own it that's all I said just just just deal with it and if you have like if you feel all guilty about the word then maybe that's something then you should do some self-reflection yeah but yeah otherwise then just yeah just just don't it just do it yeah exactly um adfa k l s d j e f uh over on float plane says I bought two shirts yeah you did I don't think yeah we very understandably I yeah I will say but I don't think we have been doing uh merch message curation at all oh yeah we should okay um where's Dan uh is 10 still here I don't know I'm looking through them right now uh okay uh yeah well hey we've actually got an update on LTT store speaking of ways that we will still be able to survive because we are a mature well-diversified company I don't mean mature like we don't make fart drugs jokes jokes um I mean mature like we have developed a lot of revenue streams to help us whether uh you know whatever AI storms are headed this way LTT store is a huge one I think I said this before but a 2022 is the year that LTT stores Revenue will be greater than our media production Revenue uh massive shout out to all of you guys for absolutely for making this possible massive shout out to the team responsible for it uh Nick Kyle Bridget Sarah Lloyd oh my goodness I'm gonna miss some people it's going to be really awful uh you know Natalie Adam Nolan uh there's some new people in customer care I don't know their name yet so I'm not going to include them but you know we got Hannah Matthew you along a day the team there is Conrad amazing thank you uh massive massive shout out to the float plane team for making that whole thing happen like it's been it's been a long time coming but it means that our future as an independent Media company is basically assured as long as you guys continue to support us in that way uh we've got a deal for you guys this week uh where is it oh wait this just says lttstore.com deal of the week question mark I thought we did have something to talk about this week oh we have something I didn't talk about last week if nothing else um yeah is that still running we launched the mystery hoodie well it's not a matter of like writing or not yeah we just have a new product so the mystery hoodie is 49.99 you don't know what hoodie you'll get but you can find some hints in the uh in the reviews that that are up we ran this as a promo during the black Friday's uh period it's yeah that's not the pricing that we're going to be doing for it in the long term it's going to be 50 bucks but we've got everything from small to Triple XL and you guys can check it out mystery hoodie sales are final we do not offer returns or exchanges but it is a way to get yourself into an LTT hoodie for a pretty aggressive price uh we're also shipping backpacks in real time now they're not back ordered in any way uh what else is there that I could really say about the the store right now I mean yeah I guess that's I guess that's probably that's probably enough um all right and uh picking something up on the store is the way to send a message into the show they're called merch messages and they're better than Super Chat better than twitch bits because all the money you spend will go into something that you actually get to keep and use and enjoy instead of lining the pockets of big Tech that's our that's our sales pitch and uh if YouTube and twitch and Facebook operated the same way as Twitter I probably wouldn't be allowed to say that but hey we never live streamed on Twitter yeah whatever deal with it oh we figured out afterwards you can't periscope's dead right spaces is not the same thing so we couldn't yeah yeah uh all right I guess we should do a couple have you I have curated some I'm working on going through the incoming Dan's not here so I'm gonna go ahead and go through a couple of our curated ones and we'll get back to some more topics here should I talk about the big thing that happened this year like the really big one the one where we convened like uh a council of people to talk about it it's it's past the NDA date for it so I could talk about it like the first one the the really big event that the really big maybe the really big event that we talked about and ultimately decided not to to do no the second event then should we talk about the second big event I'll let you think about it while I go through a couple minutes I don't think so I mean I think it might be interesting for the people to have some idea it's also the kind of thing that if I worked here I probably wouldn't want to hear about it on the WAN show yeah but I mean are they used to it at this point maybe I mean they are but that doesn't mean it's a good thing [Laughter] um atomic age a silver on float plane says do it cowards I mean I would say the same thing if I was in the audience um I do think you should probably discuss this with other internal people before we do though James Ryan says do you have a recommendation for messaging into the show for people who might not want to have a physical object show up uh buy a gift card on LTT store and then just never spend it I guess yeah or spend it eventually or gift it it's a gift card yeah give it to someone else it's a gift card yeah at least that way you're not throwing away any money yeah right yep don't throw away money because like what's the overhead on like uh on a Super Chat like 30 40 something like that yeah why are you doing that yeah all right uh Anonymous says Hey guys wanting to get into it soon and with the technical difficulties experience tonight I was wondering how help desk issues are solved at lmg is there an official ticketing system or just grab the nearest Linus uh there's no official ticketing system so you would first go to Logistics uh with Dan being your main point of contact for that sort of thing and then if he's not around I believe there's someone else who is like can kind of be helpful and then it's going to fall to Jake we actually have some documentation for catastrophic failures that uh Luke and Jacob and working together on so that you'll be you'll have some some docs that you can go to they're not really intended for the average user they're intended for more like a me or an Anthony to look at or or even people that work on it all the time it's it's mostly a like everything around you is on fire and everyone's panicking let me go back to this thing so I don't actually have to think about it so I can put my mental power elsewhere and just follow these steps and get everything back online as soon as possible it also like organizes all the information that you need does stuff like that it's a good idea to have Disaster Recovery procedures it's something that I think we could do better but it's something that also is working reasonably well for us um I think that because we are a company of relatively tech savvy people we probably have a lot fewer I can't figure out how to open my email client my computer won't turn on I was not plugged in yeah then many companies would so it hasn't overloaded those guys yet but as we expand into more say for example like physical Goods Manufacturing where we can't expect people to have a high level of technical proficiency like maybe they're a wizard with a sewing machine but you know a computer what's a compute right yeah I I don't I don't know then we might have to deal with more of that and it might be something that we'll have to address um Kevin M can you test whether lifting a laptop by its Palm rest causes a mouse click to register I frequently carry around my laptop while watching full screen videos and it's frustrating having them pause all the time both my XPS 15 and my LG gram do this so I curated this I thought it was actually kind of an interesting question because I have experienced this before me too so like maybe something interesting for the labs to consider if they start getting into laptop testing it could even be like a mostly pass fail like if by lifting it at any point in these sort of designated areas it causes a mouse click to register um then fail kind of thing yeah yeah it's an interesting interesting idea all right I'm going to submit that to Gary uh you might have to do the next one because I'm typing an email okay I'm actually going to do one that isn't curated yet but I was just going to curate it so this is from Colin r he said what what are your thoughts on the potential of AI generated video game assets do you think that oh I found it again do you think that engines like Unity or Unreal Engine will develop tools for easy integration of AI generated Assets in the workflow uh I think they are absolutely going to be a thing I would highly suspect that both of those engines will eventually find some form of integration including the potentiality of that integration just being a tool that is built into that engine I have already seen examples of people using chat GPT input prompts into something I don't remember what it was it was some AI art program thingamajigger and it was making texture maps for models that they made in 3D um I saw that too like CAD software so they were modeling like buildings and or they were texturing like buildings and stuff some of them were surprisingly good does it look perfect no no but I've seen games that were worse oh yeah I've seen finished games that were yeah relatively modern ones too like yeah that it's 100 gonna be a thing for sure stable diffusion was that it yeah I think a bunch of people saw this it was it was relatively trendy so yeah absolutely wild all right all right you guys have got some more time to send in some merch messages uh the producers back sup Dan hello how how are how are the yeah yeah days my friend I I'm for this stuff yeah hell yeah oh yeah let's go this has been an absolute poo show today to be fair this is good stuff yeah we appreciate you guys sticking with us through the technical difficulties for once it wasn't our fault and I think the response to it is pretty good we you know what if it hadn't been Flawless if it hadn't been for a thing that I can't really disclose that is special about the WAN show setup I don't think our I don't think our stream would have even stopped wouldn't even have coughed no it was it was just that that was the only problem and we will have that addressed for next time it was just one of those things we just didn't yeah we didn't think about that the WAN show will need to continue through a power outage we are set up so that in the event of a long-term power outage we can at least finish we can have one editor finish today's video that's kind of the that's the bar right and everyone else can shut down their work or shut down their computers and save their works safely but now that we know that we could do this I'm thinking daisy chain jackeries I'm thinking backup batteries on all the key pieces of infrastructure let's go power off land show yeah we can do about three and a half hours yeah which is I mean a lot of winches a lot of wind chills get pretty close to that these days it's not longer but they don't go past that yeah yeah oh I'm excited I'm excited this is great um all right what else did we got today Apple to allow third-party app stores and side loading in Europe due to digital markets act we talked about this a little bit last week but it hadn't been fleshed out in the dock because of a miscommunication so we're going to get into in a little bit more detail one really quick thing Dan are you on merch messages now I'm trying my best got it if you guys can help that'd be great okay Apple has signaled that it will abide the eu's digital markets act and allow third-party app stores and side loading on I devices this is exciting the dma is intended to prevent abusive Market power and allow new players to enter digital markets basically leveling the playing field against big Tech it was signed into law in September came into effect in November and active enforcement will begin in May that is a fast timeline for such a such an earth-shaking change to the way that these digital markets have worked up until now Apple's objections to date have been numerous it will be confusing for users it will be a gold rush for the malware industry and a cyber criminal's best friend this would destroy the security of the iPhone I'll be very interested to see if Apple's marketing around the security of the iPhone changes I'm willing to bet they don't say the iPhone is not secure yeah so maybe they can overcome this after all interesting and they said Android experiences 5 million attacks per month okay yeah um and how many do they yeah incidentally the news triggered a stock surge for dating services and apps oh wow you'll finally be able to have like say for example a pornography app on on the on the App Store yeah like apple has long taken a a moral High Ground against certain types of content interesting well unless it's in Safari web browser nobody can use Apple software and Hardware to view such things get real guys um while this is broadly seen as a victory for consumers some are less sure Sami fathi a writer for Mac rumor says that many questions remain on how Apple might implement this and suggests that it might in effect force people to sideload um apps must be able to access services and sensors and side loading could offer greater control for apps than the app stores restrictions allow I have no idea of what sami's point is right now companies like meta and Spotify are incentivized to leave as they're in direct competition with apple and apple and chafe under app store's rules um yeah so no what's actually going to happen is in order for apple to maintain any kind of revenue from the app store they're going to have to take a less abusive cut and they're going to have to relax their their policies it's good if this is good for consumers all you're doing is Sammy all you're doing is reiterating why this is good for consumers um okay bit odd this is a problem this is a really good point making sure that people are running the latest app revision this way is going to be a major issue for developers versus just having the App Store manage this that's going to be messy and then this third Point basically it's a mess all around I I I disagree um Android already allows side loading no it is not a mess all around most users I promise you don't sideload anything and it'll probably be the same way but if Apple has major Cash Cow apps come to them one after another after another after another this is finally a way for partners to put pressure on Apple to actually be Partners rather than Servants of Apple rather than just being grateful that Apple gives them the privilege of being part of their their fiefdom or whatever um limited side loading is already a thing on iOS so yeah things might not change that much but right now it's very restrictive users have to import a certificate to do so it has to be refreshed weekly to function if you aren't a developer there's an app limit of three um alt store I've never even heard of this is apparently a third-party App Store that automatically refreshes the certificates now this discussion question who's right here and why I think I've made my position pretty clear this is a win for Consumer choice and again this is one of those things where if you're an Apple user who wants to only use the app store then by all means you should have no objection to this for everyone else because you can keep just using the App Store go for it I don't want to and I don't like Apple's monopolistic Behavior so I might choose to do something else it's called consumer choice you have the choice to do it that way and this is effectively a legislative body stepping in and saying yeah apple has not in good faith provided consumer Choice has not in good faith put themselves on a Level Playing Field with their competitors on their ecosystem and has behaved in a monopolistic way if they had if they had acted in good faith this probably wouldn't have come to bite them but they didn't and so it has too bad I don't feel bad for them I just can't they've been just arseholes to deal with yeah absolutely at like every turn they've made their bed now they sleep in it yeah I'm glad the EU actually has the stones to do this now the next discussion question is what would a more open iPhone look like would you be more or less likely to buy one if it supported third-party app stores and side loading because man with side loading I'm imagining anyway a lot more functionality that I just can't get unless I want to jailbreak this stupid thing yeah I think it really depends it depends what services start putting themselves up to be side loaded it depends if if users really start actually doing it at all because if users don't do it then companies aren't going to bother running that setup anyways like there's a lot of variables there I think it's one of those things where like first generation of it might not necessarily matter too much but it'll be interesting to see how it evolves over time I have another discussion question would flow plane just immediately go the side loading route or would we try and stay on the App Store because I know which way I lean right now but let's have executive dialogue here let's talk about synergies one problem with side loading one of the reasons are we've avoided sending out packages like that in the past updates yeah absolutely we don't have an in-app updater that is something that is possible but that is a tool that we would have to make which costs money yeah um so I don't know it really depends I I could definitely see someone making like some open source uh like package updater for iPhones or something yeah or an alternate app store or that they have their own updater yeah something like so so if I mean there's a lot of potential there um there's definitely a lot more we could do with the app if we if we could just let it get side loaded um there's there's a lot of things that we've been stopped from doing like we'll get we'll get complaints people will email customer support and they're like hey this isn't very intuitive it's like you are 100 correct I completely agree with you and I apologize that there's nothing we can do about it yeah because like we can't they're like it would be really great if when I go to try to do this thing it could tell me that like I have to do it on the website and it's like yep that would be awesome but we can't we can't send you to our website sorry it is what it is ridiculous it's just and they've gotten a little bit better with it over time but like it's still far from what I would consider acceptable I think merch messages are much more under control there's there's three uh potentials no incoming and then we have 15 curated so we have a lot to go through but the the wave has a subsided let me uh let me jump through a couple of these really quickly um epic games is going to be paying half a billion dollars for copper violations and the use of dark patterns are you familiar with dark patterns yeah I would think that you would be good then why don't you explain them because you probably know more about them so a dark pattern uh and I apologize if I explained this poorly but a dark pattern is like trying to mislead or trick users in certain ways um so manipulate your website or your service so that uh manipulate the appearance of things manipulate the user experience of things like where you position different buttons manipulate things to try to funnel people in a certain direction which is probably not something that they would want to do yeah so like if you if you kind of obscure your sign up to a newsletter thing and it's a check box and it's automatically checked but it's like really small and it's somewhere that you wouldn't expect that'd be a dark pattern that would be a dark or if you have like a um like a buy now button okay for a product someone might want and then in very small text it says you authorize us to send you one of these every month yeah and you didn't realize that you were recurring signing up for a subscription service that would be that would be a dark pattern so it's using subtlety to get users to do inputs that are not what they actually want so uh 245 million dollars of the settlement is in refunds for dark patterns and billing practices that essentially made it too easy to make purchases in game often accidentally according to the FTC it is claimed that epic would intentionally switch button positions to create situations where charges were made with a single button press uh charges would also be made when the game would be woken from sleep mode through these dark patterns of deceitful UI until 2018 epic would allow charges to be made without cardholder action or approval so by default simple button presses would lead to charges the rest of it is for violating the children's online privacy protection act Kappa by not including adequate parental controls collecting children's personal information without parental consent and using overly relaxed privacy settings that included text and voice chat being active by default which I think we can all agree is not good when kids are gaming online I don't want to hear their annoying voices sorry what were you talking about other examples by the way can include things like some of these were brought up in float plane chat uh if you're trying to like unsubscribe from something the like cancel button being really big and obvious and the unsubscribe button being like a hyperlink that you can barely even tell is a button um one that you see fairly often with subscriptions man I was okay so a little while ago my uh my grandfather passed away and we were going through and canceling some of his online subscriptions and accounts and things and he had Amazon Prime canceling Amazon Prime is hard why is it so hard because daddy Bezos needs more yachts and I legitimately think I I almost man I had told myself I wanted to rage on the windshield about this and I think I forgot about it but I think it's genuinely like oppressive to old people yeah because it's really confusing and they like move around where you need to press the cancel button and they frame it in a bunch of really weird ways and like the website feels like it degrades like it feels like you go back to like 1990s internet because you get these like weird ancient uis as you're going through and like it's very weird you like you feel like you're doing something wrong the like it just it's so not okay in my opinion it I don't know it it like actually bothered me a lot I already don't exactly have the most positive relationship with Amazon so I do have to consider that um but it was actually like really terrible yeah Luke was probably in more of a hurry to cancel a Prime subscription than most people would be yeah that's probably fair enough uh but like another thing and this I I this is not a drag on him he had multiple Amazon accounts that we ended up figuring out really easy to accidentally do that at multiple prime subscriptions it should be way harder to do that yep like I just man I I don't know it's someone in full plane chat just just said I'm a CIS admin and it took me 20 minutes to cancel Prime maybe one click that should not be okay like that's actually crazy I I don't know it's in my opinion that's an extremely egregious version of like a a dark pattern yeah it's it's trying to push people to not do the thing that you don't want them to do so yeah uh I just wanted to uh read this comment from Jedi 2 uh tagging Dan you guys handled the outage well very impressed the show wasn't canceled tonight Luke and I have a streak okay it's not allowed to happen it never entered my mind that the show was not going to go on tonight I will not be responsible for breaking the streak no no one here is going to be the one to break the streak I I was told that I have too much vacation time recently so I had to book some vacation time and when I was trying to figure out when I could book it I was describing like okay I could do these things whatever I was like I can't take Fridays off it's just it's not an option it's like and show must go on when I was traveling I technically had those Fridays off but I was just like no I'm on vacation this week yeah it's a perfect example you know that yeah it's gonna happen wow show must go on I'm on vacation right now what's up speaking of things that might have brought people back from vacation uh this isn't really properly in the dock but the write-up by Scotty sang on The Forum is quite good so we're going to use that alert for LastPass users the breach in August was worse than expected a lot worse I used LastPass I've hated it for so long but I have assigned the task of switching our corporate password manager over to something else to multiple people for like almost two years now I think actually over a year I think I'm gonna take the mantle are you that would be great thanks yeah uh can we go with uh is keepass the one that has the local nonsense I don't know well I want that one I haven't done research in like basically at all I just I've been like frustrated that we haven't switched for quite a while and then this article came out and I was like we're moving it's like I'm gonna find a way I'm gonna get it done we're moving we have to move uh but anyways yeah previously mentioned breach in August LastPass mentioned encrypted data was downloaded but still secure however this recent update states that the breach was worse than expected as actors can brute force uh decrypt the copied backup vaults that were removed out of their LastPass secured Cloud containers LastPass is advertising users to sorry advising users to reset and update all passwords especially the master password uh this is not exact worst part is that there's information that is stored in plain text yeah so this is usernames and passwords not so much but the as far as I can tell the the main account information so the name email address is accessible to the hackers and the URLs yes the URLs were stored in plain text yeah so what that does is it makes the process of going through and trying to Brute Force the username and password much easier if you know what service it's for so that's one thing and number two is the entire web history of a user is pretty valuable even without the usernames and passwords and you would have it was because they're tight it's not the entire web history well everywhere you have an account yeah it's very similar but not the same I'm just saying sure I'm just saying uh but yeah it's it's I mean this is horrible um yeah I'm just gonna get out in front of it I look at some bad stuff on the internet sure mine leaks whatever there's stuff in there uh yeah and like one of the things too is like yeah people people can say like these Master passwords are going to be basically impossible to Brute Force it's a non-zero possibility and like compute it's going like this yeah and people can find ways to break certain types of encryption and all this other type of stuff so you should update all of your passwords and that's gonna suck uh but you should do it anyways and you should leave LastPass that would be my suggestion yeah yep so we need to update all of our passwords yeah and especially our passwords for celebrityfeatpix.com yeah do you got that one I don't even know if that's a real site it probably is I think I think it has to be isn't there's some there's some website that does that I don't know if it's called that uh this particular one isn't it nope it's uh it's this at the moment oh it seems to be parked yeah it's parked there's some things like that though oh I'm sure there is because I remember like forever ago you were on there or something on where I think we like joked about it you were on some website that like tracks celebrity V pics I guarantee this is a thing um I did not think this was going to be something we were going to be looking up on land show today um but I like men.wikief yeah hmm interesting is that you I mean this is yeah this almost certainly is this is I'm pretty sure this is yeah this is my old bathroom scale that's definitely my towel yeah that's weird oh you might want to close the page I think there was something no no no close it just close the page just close the page okay I see yeah all right well it is what it is um a UK regulator warns that sharing Netflix passwords may be illegal oh UK's intellectual property office said on Tuesday that sharing passwords to access content breaks copyright law the comment was seemingly unsolicited as Netflix has never stated that it would take legal action against British people for sharing passwords which is jolly good of them I suppose and since making the comment the IPO has removed references to password sharing from the guidance portion of their website but a spokesperson confirmed the agency's stance on the matter saying there are a range of Provisions in criminal and civil law which may be applicable in the case of password sharing where the intent is to allow a user to access copyright protected Works without payment tldr sharing a password is illegal in both a criminal and civil sense according to this particular sorry I'm gonna body I'm gonna interject for a second what now people pointed out that you you didn't notice that was a problem because you don't you don't see ads it's true though it just happened we weren't kidding it's actually a thing oh I find that so funny remember those uh remember those ads that would have like a super attractive woman and then it would be like by the way there's a car in the picture or whatever oh yeah you know that that super like cringe style of AD yeah um you just see the car well no I just didn't see anything you wouldn't see anything okay did you see the delay how long it took for me to find a pair of breasts on a web page doesn't see the edge I can't see it it doesn't matter what's on the ad if it's an ad I can't see it it's invisible to me we try I'm so happy that we now have like really good proof because like I know it's a thing but when you try to tell people I think a lot of people are like oh yeah sure whatever like I don't I'm not affected by ads no he doesn't see that it's different like it's actually fundamentally different so it's like Linus is Adblock yeah I can get annoyed by them uh like the video we were shooting earlier uh with the worst videos we were logged into the Linus Tech tips Google ads are um uh Google account yeah uh because that's the only way for us to see the true like dislike ratio which kind of helps when we're when we're watching the content trying to figure out what was so bad about it right uh and we don't have premium on that account and I was annoyed by waiting to watch the video I want to watch but I couldn't tell you a single thing we saw an ad before not a single one I have no idea all I really remember was registering because I we've talked about this before I have a premium account all I remember was registering that there was like we had to wait eight seconds for the current one and there was another one coming and I was like oh my goodness this is crazy but I don't remember what the ads were because all I'm looking at is that timer for when I can click skip yeah that's literally the only thing interesting becomes like a reaction time in game as soon as I realize I can't skip it my attention is so somewhere else it sure as heck isn't on my computer yeah yeah yeah yeah sorry that was just that was really funny um anywho uh despite no streaming service ever so much as hinting at pursuing legal action against password sharers um CPS the crown prosecution prosecution service has not ruled out the possibility of it seeking criminal charges against people that private tier password from their friends and loved ones that's Gotta Be Wild oh they would need to have the case referred to them so one of the streaming services would have to pursue legal action interesting I mean I don't think this is going to happen to put this in perspective torrenting could carry a sentence of up to 10 years it was raised from two years in 2017 on the recommendation of the IPO however most prison sentences for piracy have been for those running torrent sites or live streams uh here's our discussion question oh boy if floating were to pursue legal action against someone for sharing a password what would you anticipate the Fallout to be like we have never considered pursuing legal action for that we actually have some stuff that kind of tracks it um I really I don't even know know of a couple accounts that like are almost certainly doing that we have banned an account for doing it at least one account for doing it on like a mass scale I know about that when when we think it's probably a situation like I ran into one where I actually ended up talking to them about it this was like a few years ago when I used to stream um but they came into my stream and I was like oh it's you you have the same username and I just asked them about it and it was like it was on one IP for like a super long time and then it was on two IP two IPS yeah and it's like huh and they were like yeah I mean my brother and I shared an account when we lived together and then I don't remember the exact details but it was something along the lines of like I went to University or whatever we both still use the account and I'm like cool I was happy expecting it to be I was half expecting it to be my parents divorced oh well no okay the thing that we were seeing was it being used at the same time right okay um so like and my parents watched the land show care about that I don't I'm not encouraging people to do this but like if it's within reason I don't think we've ever really taken a stance on it yeah the problem is when you post like your username and login on some forum and you're like how about it God like that's when it becomes an issue if you're sharing it or if you're using your account to download the material and then redistributing it then obviously yeah there's issues there thank you as long as you're not like really abusing it like we don't really care um what if Flo plane was 300 times the size I mean I'm sure we would see it the same way as we do now to be completely honest um we would be not happy with people that were Mass sharing it um but in the way that I think a lot of Netflix accounts were shared back in the day I think it would kind of be fine um I don't know yeah we should do some merge messages yeah because those we definitely um those definitely help us survive yeah all right hit us Dan okay I've got one here from here are some uh Hey Linus and Luke and behind the scenes people liking the spooky Wan show yeah should we go Spooky For the Rest of merch messages okay I'm down let's do it I'll do it you got a new thing you got your thing okay uh wanted to ask Linus when the secret shopper part three is coming they're waiting for a while so I wanted to interject on this one and I actually wanted to answer this one although he's probably going to say the same thing uh the whole point is that we can't tell you because the and I wanted to make sure I said that before he potentially says somebody else okay yeah yeah because we the companies can't know it's coming yep so it has to be full out of nowhere yep you never expect the Spanish Inquisition yeah so sorry but no yeah there will be another one it might be happening now it might be happening in a couple years it might have happened already who knows we might have filmed it all already can't tell you anything I'm sorry yeah your mole who do you work for is it I buy Power is it main gear it's Adele tell me that's not Dell Dell doesn't care all right I got another one here from Tom hi guys do you think overclocking is slowly fading away now that CPUs and gpus are already pushing the limits yes yes easy quick got another one here from Jake hi Linus you seem to enjoy making some videos a lot more than others like the recent chat GPT PC build do you ever wish you could do more passion project videos and do you uh would you need a smaller Channel slash team to be able to do so Merry Christmas all um I mean you're already seeing that you're already seeing that process playing out right like that's where the smaller channels like short circuit are coming from short circuits a way for us to cover products that just wouldn't get enough eyeballs on them to justify uploading to LTT because it would just harm the channel and you're going to see a lot more of it um I think you can expect to see more Niche channels as the lab team builds out their testing capabilities and we have all this data and we need to publish it somehow right yeah in text is great but it doesn't make any money so obviously we're going to continue to do what we do best which is create video content so yeah you're gonna see that a lot going forward now with all of that said I think you might be getting a I might I think sometimes people can get the wrong Vibe uh just because I take on for example a more serious tone in a video doesn't mean I'm having less fun in the creation process or that I don't think it's more important or that I don't think it's as important sometimes I think it's more important but you also can't have the same amount of fun in everything you do so like if we were to go through the last few videos yeah this doing everything the chatbot says was a blast because I'm super super into this technology and a lot of the time you know when we come up with a video concept the whole reason uh that we're doing it is because it's something I want to talk about and then we just need kind of a vehicle for that so building a computer was just an excuse to talk about chat GPT in a Mainline video uh this one I had a blast with I mean Jeff and I have never really gotten a chance to hang out outside of you know a few uh small encounters at like you know work events and stuff like that um and so I always enjoy until extreme Tech upgrade and I think that comes through in the videos people love Intel extreme Tech upgrade um this one was really stressful it was a really fun idea like doing tech support but some of the tools we ran into some challenges or rather the lines got flooded and handling a flooded support line is like never fun so I think that did take a bit of the fun out of it there were elements of it that were super fun like Dr Ian cutris calling into the show bloody guy rolling you it's like a crazy question hey I got it though I'm feeling good about that it was pretty good um sponsored stuff is always challenging right like I said everything that I wanted to say but that back and forth I'm so glad that I have a sales team that kind of deals with all that for me now where the brand will come and say oh we don't like the way you worded it and I'll say too bad and then our sales team gets to kind of play uh play messenger in between but this is a super cool monitor I had fun with that uh the fake merch always a lot of fun for me working with the hacksmith team total blast like there's nothing in here this monitor I was not that interested in and then I actually used it and all of a sudden I was like whoa this is super cool love new I mean we don't really hmm we don't really make a lot of videos about stuff that I'm not interested in because I hand I hand select pretty much every topic not all but very many is there anything okay I did not hand select for us to forget about Luke's portion of the part one of the arc challenge this I hand selected this I hand selected this I didn't hand select this was pitched to me uh Tanner uh pitched this adding USBC to Old consoles that's cool but when he pitched it initially I was like uh-huh and and then when he explained it I was like whoa that's so cool and so yeah I'm super into it you know what I think what you might see in a video like this is that I didn't get to play around with it firsthand as much if I'd gotten to really play with it I think you might have seen a bit more more animation on my side sometimes it's the end of the day and I'm kind of tired like I'm doing my best but no matter how enthusiastic I am about something I still do have to present my job is not just as simple as being someone who's into this stuff and talking about it and I I wish it was because it'd be a lot easier to hire people to help me with it but Luke Luke knows I mean it's not something people can just pick up overnight try it go make a video it's really hard try to get views on YouTube yeah it is a real job and I'm I'm glad that you almost never see that anymore you know oh well if you want to make money get a real job instead of being a YouTuber it is a real job it's not easy yeah um the mood lighting is Throwback to when the power went out earlier on the show for those of you who are just joining us what else you got first Dan okay I got one here from uh Jose uh oh it's in uh yeah we've got some Mexican Mexico I'm awful of this I hope you have a great holidays I would like to know how the Dual audio project is going love your videos but some friends don't speak English so the dub would help a lot to show this amazing Channel um still in progress I haven't gotten an update from Ed on it in the last little while but we've been just kind of trying to push through the product releases and Q4 is a thing limited people availability due to weather due to the time of year um that's been a back burner project compared to LTT videos must be shot because that's ultimately what pays the bills um so I wish I had an update for you but I'm afraid that I don't for the moment okay got another hero from Kevin can you test whether lifting a laptop by its Palm rest cause you answered this earlier didn't you yes I probably didn't deal with it properly no idea yes Anonymous hey guys I'm waiting to get into it soon and with the technical difficulties experienced tonight I was wondering how help desk issues are solved at lmg oh wait we did this one too okay it's me uh sorry did you do this one Colin shout out from Korea in VR benchmarks there are different experiences based on Hardware setups and even minor Hardware changes have significant implications given VR requires a human interaction how would you try to objectively make a comparable VR Benchmark uh it's really challenging because the level of detail changes constantly and can change depending on like you said a human interaction with the headset or with the in-game environment we do have an expert on staff now I think he's actually in the chat Jakey you in the chat other more different Jake who has a lot of experience in Machine Vision from mobile benchmarking which has a lot of the same challenges and I think it's something that we're going to be able to solve in the long term but it's going to take some time okay got another one here from Jay I hope Luke's house gets fixed quickly me too do you think we'll ever start seeing multiple gpus with the same power but different Ram variants like a 580 24 gig 32 gig and a 590 64 gig and a 32 gig type of thing uh you already see this in particularly the commercial space like I think it was not very long ago that Nvidia had different versions of their quadros that had different uh size frame buffers we used to see it in the consumer space more and you I think you'll still see it in the lower end um but it's not as common in on upper tier cards because I think rather than create like the the memory cost is not a huge amount compared to the overall bill of materials for our card over you know 250 300 which is almost all of them now so I don't think it is worthwhile for our company to create these different skus um unless they think there's a very compelling competitive reason I think we've seen reactionary um reactionary responses to a lower end competitor with less vram for example to keep costs under control but very rarely do we see not at least since the 900 series I think very rarely do no 10 series had a 3 gig and a six gig version of the 1060 if I recall correctly very rarely do we see Nvidia go out of their way and AMD for that matter to have different vram versions of their cards lately and yeah my my guess is just that they don't want to support more versions of this queue why have one that is effectively obsolete before the other one if it doesn't actually save that much on the bill of materials the 3080 had 10 and 12 but those were not quite exactly the same card if I recall correctly and again that different version kind of came along later it wasn't just yeah we've got an 8 gig and a 4 gig version of this card right out of the gate like I think the last one I can remember that was like that was the RX 480 I think just or 470 one of them I think just had a four and an eight gig version don't quote me on that though okay got another one here from Anonymous Linus and Luke what would it take for me to get an LTT backpack signed by as many people on both teams as possible go to LTX go to LTX yeah that's why I curated that question yeah that's your only chance that we literally don't even ship the products from this Warehouse so how would I sign it yeah like I'm not in that I've been in that warehouse once yeah it's like actually not a thing but if pretty much the whole team is going to be there I'm assuming I think a lot of people are I think it's one of those things where you don't have to be there but you better not miss it kind of things yeah yeah kind of like the Christmas party yeah I wanna hear from Nathan Merry Christmas lmg crew and families as a standoff tool or set of standoff bits ever been considered for the screwdriver found myself needing some when replacing a motherboard recently yeah it doesn't fit in the built-in bit holder so once we have uh yeah once we have a separate bit holding mechanism we will absolutely do some socketed bits totally makes sense matter of time this one's from David hey guys I've recently developed an addiction to buying 4K Blu-rays after throwing an LG OLED and svf speakers in my bedroom any favorite go-to movies for putting your home theater to the test so far mine's been Pacific Rim not the best writing but man does it I thought you might have a good answer oh yeah not really I just um there's some really cool scenes in that weird horror uh horror movie with the with the cult um man I can't remember what it is a lot of horror movies yeah but they burned up they burn a barn at the end I don't know anyway I'm not sure um this it looks looks really great in HDR yeah 1917 is definitely a good one chats uh chat's getting us some good ones I refuse to ever put The Hobbit on any screen in my house good so that's cool oh no yeah Midsummer that's the one uh Blade Runner 2049 not a great one just the way it's mastered um we found out kind of later after like it looks really great but the way it's mastered doesn't really let um better HDR displays stretch their legs from my understanding so we've we've stopped using it um yeah la la land is really beautiful yeah the hurricane obviously you know since I own so many copies of it it's a whole thing I bought it on dvhs for a video recently wow yeah it's worth watching dvhs is a hell of a drug okay I got another one here what happened to the GPU shirt design will it ever come back what happened to all of our shirt designs right now we only have blank shirts I didn't know that yeah so our shirt printer our local screen printer got evicted from her space um and like I don't know at risk of talking publicly about you know dealings that have not been acknowledged publicly I'm just gonna say it um I don't understand uh the response that um our screen printer gave us when we basically said hey we've got lab one sitting empty why don't you lease from us and like were some way over 50 percent of your business anyway so you know why don't we why don't we just we we don't want a disruption we don't have another source we don't want a disruption in your business you don't want a disruption in your business obviously you know we're going to help take care of you because we don't want a disruption in your business we know it muddies the waters a little bit but it would be it just it would be at a market rate we're not looking to screw you over because we don't want any disruption to your business yeah um you know the way that I saw it it would be more beneficial we'd have been happy to sign a short-term lease just to make sure that there's no interruption to his business and basically the response was like from my point of view from like uh from like a business planning standpoint I understand part of it you don't want to have too many eggs in one basket you know you don't want to have that one client that's most of your sales and also your landlord you know like like I get it but on the other hand your op options are us or not running your business right now yeah you could do like a one-year lease and figure it out afterwards and like we want to help you out um we've never done anything like evil to you so what makes you think we're going to start now um so from from just like uh it seemed like a very emotional response rather than a um uh uh a carefully considered response so I don't know uh we're looking for Alternatives we found one that's actually run by one of the companies that we work with for overseas production but frankly and again no offense if you're watching this but the quality's been dog crap so we haven't gone forward with it so we need something that matches what we were using before in terms of the quality uh but we need we either need to find a new source for that or we need the person we've been working with to pull his or her head out of their butt and figure out how to like actually print some shirts instead of just like sitting and not printing shirts which is obviously not good for their business um the badger Hound says Brock come on this is hubris that's a perfectly valid reason you're just mad they said no well they should be mad they said no they're currently printing zero shirts not just for us for anyone that's not good that's bad um and like I said I fully understand their discomfort which is why we were willing to offer a short-term lease Nobody Does that uh maybe in the market you're in that's the thing uh here you do you you don't sign a one-year commercial lease or anything like that less than what is it less than 0.1 percent I think commercial vacancy yeah but it's one of those things where if we're if we're working together we're working together like you got to communicate you got to say look here are my concerns and we can do what we can to address it but if you're just going to kind of be irrational and just say no no I don't like it I don't like it I don't like it okay whatever then then I guess you're not printing shirts which is pretty bad um oh next up yeah okay good luck with that got another one here from Thomas hi Linus any update on the summertime jacket hearing your thoughts on dealing with the hassle of some scream had hit home for me would love to know if this is still happening or if it's just an idea oh still happening yeah it should be out for next summer uh the it's a great garment I absolutely love it I took it with me on my Hawaii trip a little while ago and was just pleased his punch please just punch okay got one here from Seth I can call Petty what do you mean Petty what what are you talking about I'm telling you facts you cannot like facts we tried to help offer a solution and it wasn't taken and now it's really bad for everyone involved for everyone including the other person it's a lose-lose nobody won what's crazy about it there's a uncomfortable or a lose-lose yeah and the uncomfortable it's like yeah but you just gotta like communicate it's like any relationship you can just shut down okay well then the relationship's over right or you work with people those are those are really your only two options okay this one's from Seth LTT video idea right ways of power management inside a home involving Tech UPS surge protection when to upgrade power to accommodate all the LTT talks about server's New Gen gaming PCs um yeah I mean really that's something that we're not going to be able to cover in the kind of depth that we want to cover it until the PSU tester is fully up and running and maybe we have like a second one because it's going to be an enormous volume of devices to push through it so in time in time okay I've got another one here from Anonymous hey Linus I'm absolutely loving the screwdriver I often find myself fidgeting with it instead of my usual fidget toys and was wondering if you ever thought of making a high quality fidgets as I find a lot of them to be lower quality yes we are already planning a fidget toy using the exact same ratchet from the screwdriver it's not going to be cheap because it's a super expensive part but I'm not going to apologize for that because it's going to be the best darn fidget ratchet on the market it's all we hear all the time sorry not sorry by another screwdriver yeah um this one's from Jacob gift cards until I can get a backpack what is y'all's take on development teams releasing games in Alpha stages to sell copies for cash flow and spending 10 years without leaving alpha or just never finishing the game sorry um are you saying tarkov I don't know what you're talking about yeah tarkov's still in beta uh tarkov if I don't know if that's clue or sorry true if you Google is tarkov still in beta it says it's enclosed beta I don't think it's enclosed I was able to buy a license for it fine just fine I don't think it's included close to anyone who doesn't have a credit card and pays the money yeah yeah there you go um Minecraft was another fairly notorious one Minecraft was in beta for like extremely long time um uh yeah I I mean it's a it's a thing and it's uh it's kind of frustrating but I can also understand the development team woes especially from actually no pretty much only from Indie development Studios if you're a Indie development Studio you've got a few people on staff you have a certain um amount of time you can run for is that called The Run rate I don't know what it's called it's called something no it would be your Runway burn rate there we go you have a certain amount of time that you can operate for before you out of money and if the game isn't done by then you can either offer it to people in its current state and say that you're going to keep working on it which I mean is true if you sell enough copies to keep your company going and suddenly is immediately not true if you don't yeah um but then the flip side of that is if you don't sell any copies then maybe it just never gets made at all so if it's your only way but then it feels like in some cases it might not have been the only way yeah it can be a little bit gross but I think it's just something we're gonna have to live with um I did we lose power again we had a we had a flashover flicker yeah oh you can hear it well we're almost done but yeah I think I think sometimes you got to do what you got to do and I think sometimes it's abused and oh look at this now would be a good time to insert ads there's a there's a money button it's a money button okay hold on let's do the math there's 9 900 viewers on YouTube okay uh hold on okay so what is it 30 seconds for an ad so 0.5 minutes times 9900 equals uh okay so hold on a second what is this okay this is 4950 minutes okay divided by 60 equals uh 82 hours right am I am I doing this right so far so yeah okay uh divided by 24 okay so it's 3.4 days which is about one percent of a year okay so now hold on a second if we assume an average lifespan of about 75 years then that would be let's say so one percent of a year point one percent of 10 years point about let's say about point zero one percent of of a human lifetime okay how much is that so if every time I press this button I killed .01 of a human would I keep pressing this button let's get into it let's get into it let's talk moral and ethical dilemmas oh my goodness if you could kill .01 of a human every time you pressed a button and you never knew any of them except your mom who watches the land show would you keep pressing the button Luke oh my goodness that's a that is a dark but somewhat accurate way to look at that yeah it sounds like carry the zero yeah I think it's a little bit less than that as the channel grew man I would look at the cumulative hours spent watching the content and I I would do that math like this is in the very early days and I'd go holy crap LTT has consumed out one lifetime now it's ten lifetimes now it's a hundred lifetimes and it makes them out of lifetimes like a week or a day yeah and whatever it would make me think about the value of it you know uh yeah are we putting are we working hard enough to make sure that like like this cost I think I've talked a lot on the show before about how uh a central aspect of my personal morals and ethics is um is is human cost right so when you when you steal uh a pack of dental floss you know what is the human cost of that you know fairly fairly negligible whereas when you when you steal an amount that's like equivalent to a Year's work for someone uh you know I see that as like one fiftieth of murder if you if you got what I mean yeah like if they spent that time of their life doing something that was only to get their house or their car it might even be worse than that though you're you are you're effectively you're effectively stealing what is that you're effectively stealing life from them and so I I would reflect on this number and go like am I stealing life or am I enriching it you know I gotta yeah yeah I don't know just the kind of stuff that keeps me up at night you know anywho moving on I have another one for Michael what's the best Christmas gift you guys have gotten from each other other than that was not work related we don't give gifts to each other the gift of not having to worry about it that's the best gift it is a pretty good gift yeah hey guess what Merry Christmas I got you nothing Merry Christmas man me too I uh I was trying to think when I so I curated that one I was trying to think if there was something that we've ever like done but I think it's just always been hey bro I know you're busy yeah have a good one yep which is solid yeah that's a good way to go yeah it's good yeah we uh are nope I'm not going to say that um I'll say this there are more people where I feel some amount of obligation to give Christmas gifts to this year and it's a lot of people yeah it's pain and like I hate it I don't I don't mind it as much as as you do but at a certain point I'm like trying to tally in my head I'm like have I if I completed my shopping for all these different people and I'm like this is a lot of people and then trying to keep track of that and you don't want to just like run to a mall and buy garbage the week before Christmas so you try to think about it like throughout the year and it's like man there's a lot of things to to like keep track of yeah but yeah my family's been talking about trying to like reduce and stuff because we like something that we do is we try to reuse Christmas packing as much as possible yeah so like brown paper bags are used very often um last year's tags that you put on things for sure we just put them in a box and you just re-tape it on like who cares I try to do stuff like that to make it less of a waste and uh we've all been communicating to each other for a while now to like don't try try to really avoid buying people things that are likely going to end up being garbage yeah right um but we're probably going to continue down continue down that path to a certain degree yeah we use a newspaper in my family of course yeah that's a good one we've run out of newspaper it's become a problem the only thing newspaper is good for so it makes sense that it's all getting used to wrap presents yep uh we used to use the comics Pages specifically that's cool that's actually nice yeah that's actually pretty sweet yeah I try and do the Princess Auto for Dad and then like you know uh anyway this one's from Zachary will you publish an external 3D model of the screwdriver publishing the model that is common in industry and it would facilitate 3D printed LTD driver case I'm designing PS why no ph00 Phillips double zero or pH triple zero bits in the Phillips set all right you got a couple questions here uh yes we have considered publishing an external 3D model of the screwdriver we need to make sure that we have the proper authorization from the other parties involved in the design so whatever we might feel about it we it was a collaborative product so we need to make sure that everybody's on the same page um yeah we'd love to make your life easier um for for 3D printing the driver case you're designing so stay stay tuned as for why no Precision bits um it's because it's really not the intended use case of the product and we don't want to encourage people to over torque those kinds of products with a with a big old honking screwdriver that's really more for like computer work utility work around the house Automotive work um that's why uh stay tuned though our plan is to have a product where that type of a bit would be more appropriate okay this one's from AJ how did Luke become the CEO of floatplane where you offered the job or did you apply slash ask for it I've heard you talk about coding development before did you do that before you started working at LTT I find it very thematic that this came from a person named AJ as AJ was the first person that we hired for the project and is still uh instrumental luckily to Me instrumental and is still working on the project um I am not tonight I am not yeah he's bailing us out potential right now actually because as far as I know he can't download this second one until we're done he's on East Coast time so we actually should close this shout out AJ thanks AJ sorry thank you thank you this is not the first time and it will not be the last time that I call AJ out of nowhere and I'm like hey I need you to save me uh he's in chat yeah hi I'm sorry thank you um yeah uh I so I'm not the CEO of floatplane um how was I how did I get the job well oh oh yes I'm CEO and probably cto2 is that official or is that just no effective I mean yeah he runs it let's put it that way yeah I so when vessel went down vessel was a platform that we used to be on that did Early Access video whatever when vessel went down we started a thing on the Forum which was just a sub part of the Forum called Rip vessel and I found a way to mess with the Forum software that we had to force video to sort of maybe kind of go through it the idea was that people could download it and that sort of worked and then we realized by accident that a bunch of browsers do you remember this a bunch of browsers would determine that they could just stream the video yeah as a download so it would just worked on iOS yeah it would just like play it and we were like wait what is it that easy that's pretty cool this should be really easy to do and then uh spoiler alert yeah it's really hard um and then pretty early in I was like whoa I have no idea what I'm doing uh and AJ actually posted a big like I think it was a Google doc that he shared I think that's how it was done but he posted a big thing on the Forum being like uh yeah by the way here's a plan for like probably a better more proper way of doing what you're trying to do um and it was fairly similar to what Jake Jake tyvee yeah and I had kind of come up with but again we weren't really prepared and AJ's proposal for it was like way better so I was like Hey help me um and then we've just been sort of doing it ever since there was never really I don't think there was ever really like I didn't apply for it I don't think I asked for it oh definitely not it just yeah it's it just sort of it was a revenue source that we had absolutely no replacement for at that time we really needed one that we needed and there was no other platform that was really doing what vessel was doing so we needed to Port people somewhere and we needed it now which basically meant we needed to develop it internally when I was the only person who had any chance and I barely had a chance and then AJ bailed me out and then we brought on uh Yuki not way too long after that both of those Peeps are still on the team and still killing it yep um and we would be nowhere without them um and then we brought up other people along the way and now we're here I don't know it just it just it sort of happened it was very not formal I'll say that much next up all right this is for Luke hey okay you pretty clearly play have played D and D or other tabletop role-playing games could you talk about that sure I'll I'll try to make it relatively short played a bit of d d in high school played a bit of D and University played a bit of DnD after University never like super seriously always very socially um oh hot take spicy coming out right at the end of the show no no it's sad Luke oh um I I rekindled the fire for that with Tyler oh okay sorry yeah um so it's a bit of a sore topic for me now because I missed Tyler um but I eventually um while knowing Tyler and I actually got Tyler kind of into it and he ended up running a campaign of this without me because I couldn't play on the night that he wanted to run it and stuff but we used to talk about this stuff all the time um but I ended up playing edge of the Empire with uh my brother and a couple of my uh my other friends and Edge of the empire was really fantastic I like it a lot because of how the dice work because unlike with DND where you have like your chance and your damage um in the edge of the Empire you have if I remember correctly it's it's like damaged ice and then oh man it's been a long time since I played so I'm going to say this wrong but it's like opportunity basically and your dice have to roll against each other so you have you have pluses and minuses for each type so if you if you uh say you were this is Edge of the Empire so it's a lot of like Scoundrels and whatnot so say you had like you're a Han Solo type character you've got a pistol you're trying to shoot something that's down a hallway um and you're you're not going to do any damage your damage dice come up with uh zero or less than zero but your your advantage or disadvantage or whatever it was it was called um dice came up with a large advantage so now you have to come up with something that might be advantageous and you think about the Star Wars universe and you're like okay well the shot missed it didn't hit the target that I wanted to hit but let's have it hit the control panel that's next to the door so now the door closes on the person that's trying to run away from me and you can do cool like thematic storytelling things through your dice rolls and I really thought that was very cool that added an element that I always felt was missing from DND and yeah I used to I used to nerd out about that with Tyler and then he ended up running a campaign and I I believe they liked it I think uh Alex Clark played in that campaign I think I don't fully remember I'm not sure but yeah it was a long time ago but yeah yeah I've always played those games socially I I care a lot less for the game than I do for the people that I'm usually playing it with and last one today is from Matthew hi Linus and Luke it's Matt from the call challenge video what's the deal with the beef between you and D brand are you long time friends or is it just something fun you do now I hate those guys that's my bleep button [ __ ] you D brand [Laughter] seems to work go [ __ ] yourself dbrand I think my favorite ad spot I've ever done was for dbrand do you remember this I had no authorization to do this I don't watch ad spots for dbrand because those guys fair enough uh we were at CES we're at CES back in the day and it was like only sponsored by dbrand or something so every video I had to do brand sponsorship on it I do and I was trying to make each one of them different yes and I just ran out of ideas and eventually just said dbrand like 30 times and gave no other information or context and they they loved it so it's like sweet yeah I think if that was a lot of other brands they probably wouldn't have been too impressed but uh I had a had a hunch they'd roll with it and they did which was cool but yeah screw those guys um if dbrand gets their way I will be telling you guys about the car soon enough um they ah why can't I resist their money yes yes this okay okay okay hey this is why I love those guys oh my God oh my God they want me to put the most ass possible skin what is it say what it is it's like just like your own face a bunch of times no no it's an actual product but it's the kind of thing that might be fine in small doses but over an enormous enormous vehicle might be a little much oh my goodness that actually might look super cool but it might look super cool to see on a car one time and not look super cool to be on your car permanently yeah so I'm ah yes oh my goodness they're so annoying because they'll be like they'll be like hey no would be funny you want to drink a bunch of energy drinks hey want to do something totally stupid and I'm like no not really and they're like huh I'll pay more oh so good it's so good so we'll see how it goes it makes in their defense it makes stuff work because it's gonna stand out it's gonna be interesting it's gonna be Punchy people are going to be interested in it but it's all stuff you're not going to want to do uh so yeah you got to pay more but I mean yeah it's done all right see you later guys bye [Music] [Music] the show is brought to you by sea Sonic Zoho one and vessi Footwear oh I never said see you again next week same bad time same bad Channel I didn't say it good enough yeah
