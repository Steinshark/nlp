we're here at CES 2023 and we're in Acer's Booth right now to have a look at their laptops we've got heaps of them we've got some Predator gaming laptops super fast we've got some thinning lights not fast but not heavy either but the one that I'm most interested in is somewhere in between and huge thanks to Acer for sponsoring this video [Music] this is the Acer Swift x14 and it looks freaking sweet now what is interesting about this is that so many companies have big honking laptops 15 inch loads of power and then maybe like a 14-13 that are very thin but they don't have something in the middle that's really good this though looks sweet first of all they haven't screwed up the i o they have first of all a headphone jack wow who would have thought that's something that you'd want on a laptop to help uh we also have two Thunderbolt fours USB type A and full size HDMI confirm its HDMI 2.1 good job around the other side we also have a USB type a and a Micro SD card slot I do wish it was full size but ah we'll take what we can get the best thing about this though is that despite it being uh this large it has an RTX 4050 or a 3050 depending on what you want this is looking like it could be the perfect laptop for Content creators and casual gamers because you've got that OLED display that is color accurate and full DCI P3 as well as the 120 hertz super low response times because again it's an OLED I'm sure you're not going to be able to drive that full resolution with a 40 50 or a 3050 but at the same time just knock it down a bit it'll be fine you don't need to game at the full resolution of this thing what is normally a really large problem with laptops like this though is the config they'll be like the model that you want which is this spec and then the lowest spec will be like an i5 with no dedicated GPU so you might as well have just gotten the smaller not as expensive one what I absolutely love about this now at least is that the starting config is awesome a lot of the times they'll be like oh we have the super powerful laptop but that's a little bit thicker and so on so the base spec for this in North America is the OLED display 16 gigabytes of RAM one terabyte SSD and RTX 3050 and you get all of that for twelve hundred dollars that is fantastic and I cannot wait to just we'll properly test this thing out oh one thing that I forgot trackpad seems really good it's one of those ones where uh from the factory you get a little bit of it kind of sticks just a tiny bit I don't know if you can see that yeah there we go a little bit of sticking but once you get some hand grease on there and how it slides so good we'll get back to these guys later Intel Evo certified fantastic up next we have the Predator Helios 18 and this thing is an absolute Beast although my favorite thing on first glance is that it doesn't look as beastly as it did in the past so the idea of this is a lot more professional looking you still have like some lights on the back here it's a little bit fancy but it's not the sort of thing that is embarrassing to take to like a business meeting you can just turn this off no one knows that you have an RTX 4080 in it as I'm sure you can tell by the thickness of this boy there is a lot of power so that 4080 is up to 165 Watts now why there's no 40 90 because that's the same TDP as that I don't know Acer also doesn't seem to know but there isn't for the CPU we have Intel's 13th gen 13900 HX and this thing is obscene there are 32 threads in this laptop that's what eight performance cores 16 efficiency cores couldn't how how did they do that well this little guy right here this uh Salomon flower cooler looking fan actually has a bunch of little metal fins and they've done a ton of very interesting things first thing that I really appreciate when you turn this laptop on the fans for a little bit will go full blast in reverse that gets all of the dust out hopefully also if you look at the way that these fins are made it's really interesting so they're intentionally creating turbulence in here because normally you have a little area sort of like the eye of the storm where there's no airflow right in the center by creating turbulence instead well there's airflow there you can see these tiny little uh little notches on the end that's how they do that even though these fans do look pretty cool you aren't going to be able to see them very much because they don't have that cool glass panel up the top what you will be looking at though is this display and it is fantastic here we have an 8.3 inch mini LED display which gets up to a thousand its peak brightness and while it does that it does it at 250 Hertz I had to ask them like three times if that was right it's not 240 not like 150 or anything 250 Hertz I don't know why but that's what it is resolution also is 2560 by 1600 so that's 16 by 10 on a laptop like this which means that if you want to do professional work like video editing this will be an absolute monster for that but if the 1700 price tag of this just to get in the door is not what you want well we have the Nitro we took too long in the booth and got kicked out but we have a nice comfortable coach now which is fantastic and also we have this Acer Nitro now with this guy you don't get the fancy mini LED panels it tops out 165 Hertz but also like 165 Hertz is good enough for most people and I really appreciate how again it doesn't look like gamer vomit they have a new logo here and instead of like big red lights all over it it's just these simple little accents that look just very cool but what if you don't want a game at all well the Swift lineup has a bunch of new ones now the biggest upgrade this year for all of the Swift lineup is that you have the option of OLED displays now one thing that they haven't told me is how much of a hit to battery life the OLED display will be but at least this isn't a 4K panel this right here is 2560 by 1600 which should be at least a couple less pixels for you to be going for unless of course you got the 16 inch then you have 3200 by 2 000. the main difference between the Swift go and the Swift is the construction so the Swift go is stamped aluminum and it's like actually that still is quite well built is it oh there we go yeah it doesn't have quite the same level of rigidity as the Swift which has a cnc'd aluminum chassis that is oh yeah there we go this really shows the difference that a chassis can make so on the Swift go even though I'm almost certain that it's the same switches as on the Swift X the keyboard goes from like an a A plus to maybe like a minus B plus somewhere on there it's still very usable but it doesn't have the crispiness because you do have that chassis Flex moving over to the Swift though oh this one I think has different switches and they are by far the best of the bunch this is like an a maybe even an A plus also this is absolutely shocking but on a thin and light laptop they have good I O who would have thought of it so we have USB type a full size HDMI and two Thunderbolt ports over here and then around on the other side we have another type a and a headphone jack love to see it we also have really fancy diamond cut edges on the side here and I just like the look of this thing what do you think Andy does it look good on camera yes both of these laptops are Intel Evo certified and these ones have the Intel i7 13700h that has six performance cores eight efficiency cores and that's a lot of cores for a laptop of this like look at the size of this how do they fit that many cores into here as long as you don't need a discrete graphics card that thing is going to absolutely rip it also comes with Intel Unison which allows you to sort of pair your phone easily transfer files and like receive messages to your laptop I haven't tested it out yet but Anthony is this week so again subscribed to check that out I don't remember if I mentioned it before but the Swift x14 also comes with a 76 watt hour battery that is very impressive for a laptop of this size anyway huge thanks to Acer for sponsoring this video if you want to check out any of this stuff look at the links down in the description and also huge thanks to Acer for lunch that I'm about to have huge thanks for watching this video hit like get subscribed if you're looking for something else to watch after this maybe check out our tea cooled PC it's a it's a PC that has actual tea inside of it have a good day [Music]
