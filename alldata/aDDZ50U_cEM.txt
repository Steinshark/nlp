listen I'm not saying that I'm some kind of computer Guru or a voice of judgment but I will be judging using my voice to it doesn't matter the point is your favorite celebrities and creators have a dirty Secret this is absolutely disgusting my God this is a pro gaming setup Dead Fly there oh that's right they're hiding PC setups that are so janky and disgusting that even Luke would be a shame that's impressive on this trip to the LTT rotisserie we are going to be roasting the nastiest Lee's classiest setups from your favorite YouTubers celebrities and streamers and by the time we're done I am not going to be on anyone's Christmas lists yeah probably not I don't think you are right now except the Christmas list of our sponsor build Redux worry about screwing up your build let build Redux do the screwing for you as in putting in the screws like screen anyway the point is you can get your dream machine shipped right to your doorstep by checking out build Redux at the link down below why don't we kick things off with ammunition a twitch streamer who in person told me that she learned how to build a PC from me I actually can't believe it's going to be that bad I suspect this one's gonna be pretty good yeah that's pretty sick that is sick too much but I'm assuming that's because the separation between her gaming computer and a streaming computer yeah and Wendell has a KVM that I think would be for a setup like this you can just have your keyboard mouse and display plugged in to both computers at once a little bit of roasting does have to happen here do you really need a gaming grade keyboard for your stream PC I'm suspecting especially because the mice look really similar it might just be her previous set which is fairly valid got the UPS though taking care of your stuff good call it's also a good one I like it Ann didn't skimp on the UPS yeah got the display set up for the mechanical keyboards I'm pretty sure that's Ikea I thought these were supposed to be bad though we started with someone who learned from me oh wow okay all right now let's go to someone who didn't learn from me but did take a computer that was built by me oh my God I think the pixels helped salt shaker is it because he's really salty what is with these potato quality pictures people sent I thought these are professional content I think he's waving but you like can't even tell because it's so pixelated this is some crap Cable Management there's even like an unplugged power cable just hanging there unplugged USB cable right here that might make sense maybe oh my God all at the same time this is what happens when you're socialist and you give away all your money I just can't think of another reason to use a clamp as a speaker stand also most people will angle their speakers up up toward their ears and go the other way you're angling it to fire into the table my brother ah there's the computer the left leaning piece hey what's this other computer have you replaced the computer I gave you already there's nothing even plugged into it yeah Linus made my PC but he's not using it yeah but he doesn't even plug it in doesn't even pretend to be using it founder of one true king here whoa that does look pretty good that looks very uh wait oh whoa I thought you said The Rat's Nest was only visible on the one side there but whoa dude he's working here you know yeah this is hyper functional UPS though oh nice he's uh could still be for work you don't know I happen to be a shoe enthusiant we've got the green screen right here just in case you need a green screen that is a completely unacceptable amount of mousing space Oh yeah you could put that mixer somewhere else yeah we need ammonia wipes at your desk for that I genuinely don't know whoa I don't think the two thumbs up belongs in this picture and the cable mess is quite the mess but this is also a production area so I'll give him a little bit of credit for that does it go under yeah I think it goes under the green screen which is more of a green mat on the floor shout out UPS though yeah I'm kind of feeling Hank Green next it's classy if you take the plants away and the production equipment this is exactly what I would expect from like a middle-aged ad including the printer love to see it got that one page on there ready to go in case you need one document or more likely because your kids stole all the other printer paper I don't see the computer is it just the uh the iMac oh did they just take the standoff yeah you might need to pick some things up off the floor is this acoustic treatment on the bottom of these shelves I don't think that was the most effective way to do that sir but you are rocking this chandelier and the woodwork is really cool like those walls and the shelving units are really cool yeah who would use Apple's included Mouse I agree that thing sucks it looks like he might need a bigger desk pad yeah Hank if you need a new mouse pad just let me know yeah we got you covered okay let's do baby no money fellow British Columbian actually did not know that he was from here I didn't know that either nor had I ever heard of him before at all really I know I know I was just in New York Yvonne and I were playing a game called every musician who shows up on a billboard in Times Square have you heard of them or not and we both lost every single round oh oh that stained glass oh I believe that you have no money money the magic gathering playmat as a desk pad is a classic maneuver is this a pair of wired airpods earpods yeah for gaming uh he's got those headphones right there why are the earpods on the keyboard why are they both it's kind of fascinating that a musician has like the worst audio setup we've seen so far it goes to show you steamer culture and like gear Envy has gotten out of control yeah oh this is a totally different setup I do appreciate that the audio setup has massively improved yeah really nice headphones really nice speakers what is this I don't know what that is kind of looks like a like a base station of a soldering iron or something yeah or like something you'd use to like cook piece of industrial equipment yeah that's an unusual sticker to decorate your space with I do not like the power strip right where your feet are maneuver let me open that back wall by the green and you can see his social media schedule oh oh yeah look at that right you got to do what you got to do man yeah trying to try to throw shots for the peanut gallery leave them alone this is totally different again he's still got the printer maybe the DM will reveal something take some cursive photos soon but some things are migrating from setup to set up that printer is I think that's the same as before Oh so maybe this is the setup Evolution yeah it's got the same calendar same monitor same printer is this a beaker of milk that's a candle my dude all right okay so this must be the current setup this must be the current setup then how about how about Wendell from level one tax he's either gonna have to stick his setup or he's gonna have his the equivalent of having his car out in the driveway on cinder blocks okay love it so far it's the sickest setup one yeah with the custom wallpaper he doesn't have enough monitors so this is a spare monitor in case one of these doesn't work properly I'm liking this chunky keyboard it looks like a streaming card oh my God this mouse pad though tucks looking through the window well thanks son I'm loving the camera peeking is it mounted on wood cameras mounted on a cardboard box if it works yeah no side panel okay it's not quite cinder blocks literally he taped it to the thing oh wait what that's how it's staying on wait this is suspended from the what the heck also Luke there's another computer back there that is not propped on a cardboard box oh if it drops on a cardboard box and a book whoa whoa what about second keyboard I didn't even notice that love that the sticker's still on the laptop I I really like that it has like extreme streaming cart energy but it's actually just his setup this guy is just going to be trolling it's going to be a PlayStation I didn't immediately jump for that I I assumed it would be like very perfectly set up though I am so angry that he's running a Windows XP wallpaper I hate that he has that tray right in the middle really no mouse Austin no keyboard no mouse but like framed or whatever that is Pokemon cards you need your paper shredder like right there he's got the sponsored blown apart phone in a frame but not on the wall In fairness to him young kids does he have time to mount things to the wall probably not does he have time to get a mouse and a keyboard and well not directly use the laptop and get two monitors instead I feel like he does also he might save him time does he really likes bouncing off the not he's better when it comes to production stuff than me but my understanding is that's already a diffuse light right Andy is that necessary more diffused okay honestly I will be disappointed I'd be happy to come and do a makeover yeah dear Bauer it's either gonna basically look like a workshop or be like Immaculate no I think it's gonna be a mess all right it's Immaculate I see a lot of cable mess back here that's not that bad yeah it could go into something you can't tell yet that distro block though good gravy he's a actually running a Dominus this may be the only one of these in operation this platform was so stupid I'm not convinced Asus did more than one tiny production run of these things for like influencers and reviewers other than what appears to be like a a wrench or socket kit or something yeah some kind of tool kit that is clean oh that's less clean I Hazard to say like minimalistic there's obviously an immense amount of focus on what is inside the computer yeah nothing else matters nope is the camera mounted to the wall that's kind of cool actually no I actually don't think I'm into that why because if you need to adjust it you get to put four more holes in your wall my notes say he's Drake you know who Drake is these pictures are Paradox Customs we have toe proof Drake actually uses this computer okay wow I hope you got noticed oh we built a PC for PewDiePie hey we got notes I hope we got noticed too thank you Linens oh I really really really like the treadmill that commitment to personal upkeep I'd love to see it he's got a little bit of art to brighten his day rocking the laptop stand so that you have space for your sunglasses and this is about one of my second laptop stand like the cables aren't super managed at all but they're a little bit managed and they're probably very easy to swap in and out looks like a place for someone who does work I don't think those sound panels are really doing anything at all is he trying to set a record for like biggest oscilloscope collection fatter radio I'm a friend Spotify man he's told me his space is really small but I had no idea how small it was yeah is that where he does like all his this is his whole studio whoa oh my God you can put this on the wall at least that's the OG gold one too isn't it so there's like so few of those and he just has it in advance oh that's an unfortunate freeze frail what is with this video file so I'm painting I drew like 40 years ago he did that did that okay that's pretty cool that's very cool oh my God what is up with that travel size Bluetooth mouse sir that's unfortunate so wait did he paint his background and the background is drawn by my daughter whoa whoa wow his daughter drew the desktop background family artists love it very cool Hardware unboxed I keep saying they're going to be janky and I keep being wrong so I'm saying it's awesome wow full of cannot hazes like that I believe this was limited edition review only packaging for the 2990wx man all the sick Hardware boxes are these all computers down here that's a lot of yes a lot of cases oh my goodness air conditioned the gamer directly right how is this space so amazing also is this a tool cabinet it looks like it with a wooden topper that's kind of Genius yeah that's really cool oh holy crap this is some efficient use of space here but I have that is so cool can one man really use all these computers husky Starcraft and Rosanna Pansino here is mine and rosanna's setup whoa they're like actually like shoulder to shoulder right next to each other whoa how do you guys avoid you know screen peaking when you're 1v1ing I do think it's kind of a cool idea for streaming because they clearly have one camera at this setup okay these monitors actually drop down into there so that they are hidden so if you want to do a podcast or something and you don't want monitors in the way and then behind us for our backdrop are all these custom built kind of LED tubes or light tubes whatever you want to call them wow those will change any color you want that is a sick setup whoa that's creepy man I gotta find wow Consultants who do set design with rendering like this all right there you go I mean we're gonna have to do Mark Rober right Rockin the pro display extra man is this possibly the classiest setup we've seen yet oh Hank greens is up there too no computer here yeah yeah I see that I see that smart guy where is it because there's the cable comes all the way underneath the carpet very nice very nice now I'm gonna self-roast myself and say that you bought a Mac Pro this computer sucks and Linus you explained to me all the reasons why that was true at Creator Summit which I can't remember but can I just shout out Mark's house designer for putting indoors that people like me are comfortable using I love that wall decoration the the back wall is super cool that looks amazing yeah next we're gonna do someone who doesn't reply to DMS from me but apparently does reply to DMS from my staff now am I very very clean I don't see a single oh is that one cable I only see like one cable what am I looking at yeah that's what I was trying to figure out I thought it was a like a light box at first and now I don't really think so but it looks sick and now hold on a second is this a roll down projector screen and is there a couch back here there's gotta be pretty sick space Gotta Love underwear Linus on the monitor oh yeah that's helpful perfect is this a box for an HTC One he might need it for a video yeah sure you don't know yeah that could come up pretty frequently we apparently have some pictures from Neil blomkamp the creator of memorable Sci-Fi movies like District 9 and forgettable movies like everything else he's done oh that's not nice that's a big suction cup found one of the few people in the world who actually bought one of those 32x9 Samsung monitors and thought it needed some fingerprints hey it's got to be more theatrical I am actually kind of loving the blackout velvet curtains if you want no light that's the way to do it in the biz pre-built for masseuse look he's busy directing movies like District 9 and others this is not how we store headphones people here's how you store those ones we haven't even been that mean up until now why you gotta be like this no is that would they have done that for the pre-built I don't know ooh set up at work though whoa and it's sick he's got chappy there wow making fun of Halo novels is this all like concept art books from different games and stuff seeing Halo Rogue one Mass Effect yeah Titanfall you ought to love the the film guy who has a Logitech webcam on a tripod that is about the most most Overkill tripod possible for that webcam Ultra extra super wide monitor Enthusiast gotta have it at work too yeah that is a scuffed looking I built this myself gaming PC I like it this thing is really since I actually got an HX 750i in there gone to some Lan parties sir how much do you love that he got this in the foreground like this gotta create depth with the shot we got another man who cares about his work very good I see the UPS very good love to see it yeah don't be mean to kneel I like his setup coming up Joe Rogan oh my God what's with people buying this stupid thing do they have the wheels oh my God I think they have the wheels is it that small of a dead does it just feel like a small desk no I think it's a really small desk my notes say oh my God it looks like a 14 year old who just discovered atheism decorated the Titan submarine John Green Let's Go wait this is uh okay I do everything I do on a single laptop with no monitor or anything like that oh my God they're not even a lot they're not even snapped to grid tell them about folders yeah that's rough how do you write good books like this guess it goes to show you it's the mechanic not the tool right the fault in our toolbars Jack Black setup here we go it's a lot of subwoofer that's just two separate subwoofers for the two separate setups here you know you're the kind of guy right who gets called that's all I'm saying I'm saying this guy takes phone calls yeah all right that nobody calls me you don't get called we got Ludwig set up here just moved maybe okay I thought this was a giant like bong themed thing but I guess it's a key key to what I don't know the Disposable cups man I mean a lot of them who needs dishes monitor behind the other monitor I don't like okay having a cable what is that hanging across your mouse pad like this twice wait is this your keyboard what go behind the desk what the heck man like it's not even hard to get at Red Bull can on the floor oh what that looks like a stained ass chair what did you do in that chair sir okay got the pedals I can respect it yeah I wonder how to use them for how often uses them because there's no wheel hey look maybe he just likes to use petals as an input I turn with a and d i gassed with my feet who drinks bottled water at home yeah that's lame it's actually gross like it actually tastes bad yeah you should get something else that's not cool get a Brita filter got camera here stand's kind of broken but [Laughter] quality camera holder the job done you oh don't floss over your keyboard nice mouse pad fun that's a fun Mouse so he says it's a mouse pad it's it's it says card doesn't it card game card game it's a play mat doesn't even have a proper mouse pad yeah like these are millionaires many of the people whose setups were looking at my foot pedals um it's not plugged in but I like touching him because it makes my feet feel good the explanation is even dumber than what either of us bought who's who's that Linus anime question of the day I have no idea all right this is inside the PC is this just open the Top's just open that's where the dust comes in I've been meaning to clean up oh there's oh yeah at least it's close this rug though I hate it you're ruining your hardwood floors and you're ruining your rug quality that's my setup tour uh if you want to see more uh like And subscribe Marquez of course of course it's Flawless yet another Mac Pro even his water bottle is color matched with his setup I'm actually a little disappointed the cables yeah yeah everything else is like great and then it's like I've got 14 feet of extra cable here you know what I should do with it I should just dump it right here in a pile see the thing is that if you look at my office yeah the Aesthetics are worse but I clearly didn't even try but no one yeah no one expected anything there's a difference this guy clearly uses his Mouse a lot that is some good mouse pad Gunk right there I like it got the shoe got the Hat never know when you're gonna need to walk somewhere one foot ready to play table tennis at a moment's notice ooh saradici there's only one cable that makes this work and it's an old Belkin VR cable that you can sometimes find on Alibaba what does that even mean Sarah it's this cable though apparently I guess I don't even see what it goes into the computer if you're gonna have a book prop up a monitor that's the one I think so oh liking the keyboards these days I really hate using my table as my melting surface even if it like does well with tracking and everything I'd much rather have the most well where's that your table which makes it a really really bad idea everything about this is fine except for the fact that my guy you looked at your screen instead of your selfie camera rookie move it's like a pet peeve of mine people who are looking at their screen we got I did a thing a little dead fly there oh very good it's ever been clean very good is this dog food this poor play button yeah I know it's the new one and no one cares about these ones but like this actually still offends me more than electrobooms oh this is hey Luke you know how much you love it when I touch monitors yeah he looks like he rubs his face on his body that monitor has been cleaned exactly as many times as this shell Dr case has got to be Immaculate not bad though they're managed front okay looking it's okay pretty slick you know some people just don't need the printer I could see him needing the printer what the hell is up with this mousing area though literally zero that is the worst don't need it you even have all this desk pad side panel off oh I don't like the the storage that's not a fan bad yeah is this supposed to be vibration dampening the cables bother me that much mostly because there isn't an insane amount of them yeah and because they're masking taped in place right I don't think that's actually holding any cables I think you're right Simone Garretts okay okay that looks like an incredibly comfy place to work so maybe it's worth it I would be sad about not having a keyboard a mouse but like chilling with your dog on the couch I'm also thinking we have a new Contender for a classiest taste in Decor immense style moist critical here we go oh yeah baby that's what I've been waiting for that's what it's all about oh I mean he's not really no really no necessarily what what I I got the penis computer got the Retro games whoa with the Halo 2 I think it is helmet that's our whole view of this I don't know why he he's doing the triple mirrored I don't know maybe it gives you some kind of Advantage when it comes to reacting to things the first if I see it three times I can absorb it faster oh Zach wow a dad cave what is that picture that appears it looks like the laptop internals yeah or phones or something oh dbrand tear down skins that was a collab with Zach that's right got the 32x9 monitor with a voiceover setup just ready to go at any time a Post-It note man we've seen very few of the those I used to be like a mega Post-It note guy I would just write everything I needed to do for the day on a Post-It note Stick it to the bezel on my monitor back when monitors had bezels I think that's some form of like backup power yeah being outdoorsy like he is I could see him I could see him using something like uh it's like a jackery alike I think computers got a wood uh some wood under it for a better airflow I believe oh I like to see that uh lgr I think this is exactly the right amount of cable management for a functional setup yeah things are tied kind of tied together but you could you could take it apart very quickly yeah if it was anyone else I'd be like what floppy disks not one floppy disk for decoration floppy disks that look like they're actually being used also the optical drive and not just an optical drive but the front door of the case open because of the frequency with which you are using said optical drive love to see the UPS wow now I too have a spindle of blank discs somewhere certainly not within Arm's Reach anymore it's been decades since that's needed to be the case got a nice folding exacto knife I think that is Tommy in it oh my god oh that's rough what the hell that's actually rough I it's hard to tell from the image but this looks it looks extremely Dusty disgusting yeah Mac which is laying on the floor PlayStation 5 just on the floor just you can't sit at that desk without your feet on cables at least the play button it's on the wall yeah this lighting here though feels like my daughter did it both in terms of taste and quality I mean we've got T-Pain oh whoa is he playing a shooter with a controller on a computer uh you don't necessarily 100 know yeah that is a computer never mind see you later hey got George not found um with a lighting switch for his room just on his desk I'm actually down with that George not found more like personality not found I feel like not having the monitors on was like a tactical decision I feel like he probably has a really messy desktop yeah and he didn't really give us a look at the cables I see them yeah I see them I think there's some some hiding going on yeah yeah you tried to hide everything about your setup but we know we know it's not pretty Here Comes 100 t double lift I can't say I like the thick desk why do you have two speakers on the right what the hell at least it's an easy fix you can literally just pick it up and move it don't play barely wireless mouse put the dongle right there is this for pennies like yeah you know what you need is a new desk pad maybe the new pcmr one from ldtstore.com big collab collection we just did with them guys you're gonna want to check it out he's a professional gamer yeah oh sorry I I didn't know that this is a pro gaming setup apparently I mean yes Warren Jay schlatt we've got another investor in starforge systems is that even a star Forge system beautiful setup though yeah you managed to get your stereo speakers on the left and the right so that's just nicely set up that actually uses a stream deck some of our other setups here actually enough space for his Mouse yeah and your cat is in one of the three positions for cash just where cats go on top of the computer on the keyboard or on your chair when you go to sit down that's like perfect whoa Cappy leg don't take it don't touch this yeah that's not his that's the cats these two cents his setup's gonna be yeah okay that's pretty sick he does have the one like completely inaccessible drawer unit in the back right hand corner I don't know put something you don't you don't you're trying to find anything to go after this thing How many pairs of headphones can one man use it time there yeah but that's an awesome thing actually has his play buttons on the wall love to see it let's have a look at kit boga's setup love the desktop wallpaper two mice and they're both cramped on like a tiny like one dollar unicorn Mouse pack can't say I love that as much we've got another knot oh my God it said Doom floppy disk that's that's a flex that's a flex one of anything okay he's got the old mixer on the left but he's got a go XLR middle and then something to the left of that that looks much the same is that because he like has to change no there's other ways he has two cameras what's happening oh that's under the desk also I think you're adhesive for your acoustic panels is coming off next up we've got sapnap who sent a whopping 11 pictures I mean some people didn't send enough but wow that's more RGB than computer what's going with that speaker who's listening to that massive amount of mouse space you know you start gaming you kick this thing over to the left you're ready to go man with how many go xlrs are out there it kind of makes me wonder why they're disappearing yeah and TC Helicon just as long as see you later yeah that's what happens to your carpet my friends are we getting a picture of this computer oh here we go wow wow Das a lot of RGB snazzy labs and it's not a Mac it wasn't for the cables it would look like a render it's basic the HP printer is as prominent as the any other part of it the Linus face and the windows logo wow look at that cable management not easy in a case like this Mac guy showing us PC guys how it's done some ordinary gamers set up can confirm that's a pretty ordinary gaming setup got your Kleenex the custom plywood table on the left it looks like he just kept going my widescreen doesn't go far enough where the hell do you put your mouse where's your mouse pad also I know this chair yeah yeah it's not a very good chance the Costco special very functional piece of TV Furniture yeah did you make it these sides are very different yeah tavarish wow with a killer set up that looks amazing it really does I really like the purple too everyone needs to get on LTT store and get a proper sized desk pad for their desk okay oh my God Tupperware also dm'd us whoa love the plant on top of the computer draping in front Okay now I was gonna say you managed to go anime wallpaper without being too cringe but then I saw the one on the right sorry hey two minute papers yep I guess this is about all you would need to read really really fast and enthusiastically viktar oh wow okay that's just showing off keyboard up in the top left an unconventional I feel like I'm somewhere that I have to pay to be yeah you know what I mean TSM Fanfare is up got the Vitamin D supplements amazing got the copper bracelet for channeling your energy respond to this DM while brushing their hair God cletex right there like right there it's literally easier to grab Kleenex than it is to edit your go XLR settings got these cute little Cable Management things with nothing in them an actual Alienware gaming computer in the world yeah I want you to look at something you got to open up a browser oh okay
