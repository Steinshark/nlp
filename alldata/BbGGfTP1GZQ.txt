so I've been getting a lot of questions about what happened last week I mean I showed you there was a banana in the closet what has happened to that banana let's go ahead and see so apparently they've multiplied we've discovered that bananas multiply when you put them in the closet but now it's time we talk about something a bit more serious and this is how we can format F strings in many different ways I mean we're used to formatting f-strings with the basic syntax we put F in front of some quotation marks but there's still a lot that a lot of python developers do not know about app strings and maybe it's part of the basic documentation but a lot of us never thought about reading it so in this video I'm going to show you more than 10 different ways that you can format strings in Python using the F string and these are some really cool formatting tricks so I definitely recommend you follow along for this video now we're going to be starting with the very Basics so we're going to have a number of type floats and this is going to equal let's say 1000 or 10 000 and it's going to have six decimal places after the Thousand so right now we have one of the most ugly numbers in the universe and we're going to see how we can format that later but I also want to show you that we can do something with text as well so this is just going to equal a sample text so we can see how that gets affected now the first thing we're going to do is talk about text alignment in fstrings so for example if you create an F string and you go ahead and insert this text variable inside here you can say whether you want to align it to the left to the right or whatever you want if you go ahead and insert a number such as 20 here it's going to align the text to the left which you wouldn't really notice unless you added some text here such as hello as you can see it's going to occupy 20 characters of space inside here for this variable now if you put something that is less than the variable length it's just going to use the normal space this is the minimum so if the variable is longer than the space you want to occupy it's going to override that but let's keep that at 20 and if you want a visual clue that this is going to the left just add an arrow and the reason this makes sense is because now when you go ahead and add a right arrow for example you're going to see sample taking 20 characters of space and it's going to be pushed to the right so this is so this is the right alignment and you can do the same thing with the the up Arrow if you add that it's going to center it in the 20 characters of space so that's the first tip and trick you should be aware of when you're working with formatted strings is that you can align the text depending on what you want to print now that was cool and all but there's something else you should know about this and we're going to copy that paste it directly under because what you should know is that you can also add symbols so you can add an underscore or you can add let's say an asterisk or you can add some crazy symbol let's go ahead and hold option such as this and whatever symbol you decide to insert will be placed at the end of the remaining space or it will fill the space that's empty so this actually works for all three of them you can do it to the right you can do it to the left or you can do it in the center and the output is going to look like this you're going to see for the first one that we're filling the space with the underscores at the end and for the second one it will be on the left side and then the empty spaces in between for this final one over here and again you can use whatever symbol you want you can add an ad symbol if you want and it will fill the remaining space with that and it's just fun because you can style your text in weird ways with less code but that just about covers styling text now let's go ahead and see how we can style the number so we still have this number that is incredibly ugly and what we're going to do inside here is find out how we can style it in a nice way so the first way we're going to style It Is by reducing the decimals because right now it's far too many decimals and will look bad when we print it so here we'll go ahead and print the number followed by how many decimal places we want it to be reduced to so for example 2f.2f is going to reduce it to two decimal spots and you can even add a 4 if you want you can add zero if you want whatever you want this just tells you that we are formatting the decimal places and very similar to this one right here let's change that back to two is adding a percent sign so in case you have some sort of percentage you are calculating you can add the percent sign and it's going to round the percent and as you can see it even converted whatever number you had to a percent so instead of 10 000 it actually became one million and twelve percent now with something like this it gets quite annoying because you have to count how many zeros there are and you don't really know if it's a million or a hundred thousand it becomes quite big so one very good tip is to go ahead and add a comma in front of the dot so if you go ahead and run this you'll see it's going to automatically separate the values so we can easily tell that it is 1 million and this does not require you to have a decimal place at the end as you can see we can also type in 10 000 and it will still separate it but you can use it in combination with either the formatting to F and the formatting two percent so as you can see here now we have the dot 2f for the two decimal places and it's still formatted the 10 000. so it's pretty cool that you can just go ahead and add a comma for big numbers it just makes it easier to read now let's go ahead and remove these and change this number to 1 million for example so here we have 1 million and I use the underscores to make it easier to understand and what we're going to do is print this in scientific notation because it's quite a big number and we don't really care about showing the entire number we want to shorten it so here we can go ahead and say number and what we're going to do is just add point zero e and by running this it's going to give us the scientific notation of the number and if you left it as a simple e it's going to convert it to a decimal for some reason I don't really like that when it's a whole number such as this one but to solve that you just go ahead and add point zero because that tells it that we wanted to format itself to zero decimal places so that's how you get a clean scientific notation output and the final formatting we're going to cover is with the dates so here we're going to go ahead and say current date is equal to daytime dot daytime dot daytime now I'm just joking dot now so now we get the current date here and here we're going to go ahead and print the formatted string of current date and we need to format it here how we want the date to actually show itself so we're going to use something such as a percent D to show the day followed by a percent M and whatever you put in between these percents is going to be just a normal string character so and now we're going to show the entire year so uppercase Y and we want to show the hour followed by the minutes followed by the second so if we go ahead and run this you'll see that we will get the current date formatted as we wanted it to be formatted you can add whatever you want in between the time or between the dates and it's going to format it the way you want it to be formatted now there's just one more thing I have to cover and this was a common question in one of my shorts so here we're going to go ahead and say number is equal to 100 and number two is equal to let's say 10. so let's go ahead and make sure that says number and let's go ahead and print the formatted string of the number now someone in the shorts comment section was asking how do we add number two inside here because we can't just go ahead and type in number two and it's actually quite funny all you have to do is go ahead and add some extra curly brackets inside and you will create this curly bracket Inception because whatever you write inside here is now considered a string so you need to once again format inside the formatting and when you go ahead and run that you'll get number pushed 10 spaces to the right you can do the same thing as from earlier you can push it to the left if you want and it will work exactly the same way as from earlier and this also works with the symbols so again just have fun with this there's so many different things you can do with formatting strings a lot of people are going to tell you this looks complicated but use it for your personal code have fun with it and if I happen to miss something I would love to hear it in the comment section down below do share some cool tips on how you can print strings it's just fun to know in case you want to do it of course but as always guys with that being said thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video
