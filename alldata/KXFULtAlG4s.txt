ladies and gentlemen there's a weird myth that people on wall street these investment gurus are somehow smart they're not not only can monkeys beat the average wall street genius mastermind but they're not actually that hard to fool history is full of investors getting one over on wall street selling them terrible companies that they later have to take on after they invest in it it's a practice as old as time that's even how kevin o'leary the great shark on shark tank made his money in the first place was uh selling a garbage company at the height of the dotcom bubble and today we're covering one of those stories of what happens when you try to impersonate youtube and tell everyone that you got the pop and new show that all the millennials love well let's go to the board and check it out ladies and gentlemen welcome to the 10 million studio i'm your host coffee zilla and today we're talking about a company you've probably never heard of before aussie media guys it's the new hotness with millennials all the jinzy the gen y the gen x we're all loving it and goldman sachs actually wanted to buy it for 40 million dollars let's take a a little peep at their poppin youtube channel that must be worth a lot of money because goldman sachs is not coming to zilla by the way pump the stock uh they're not coming to zillow with 40 million dollars let me tell you that right now and uh i want to find out what the competition's like what the geniuses on goldman sachs big brains think the pop and youtube channels look like oh 3 000 subscribers from ozzy media and oh 2 000 views guys that's what it looks like when you're just really in the zeitgeist when you're really when you're really touching the pulse of common media this is what goldman sachs is looking for guys give me a call over sex if you want actually somebody you know let me know i'll sell out i don't care i'll sell out but anyway let's get into this article it's hilarious this is a this is just a classic case of trying to sell sh and make it look like gold and goldman sachs almost believing it because they're not too bright that's the amazing thing this is what how you know there's so much money in banking is people at goldman sachs are really still kicking after they almost got fooled by stuff like this and they're making tons of money let me don't get me wrong all right ozzy media was started by this guy carlos watson who apparently worked as a cable news anchor he's basically saying i got this poppin youtube channel and he says you know where many of its videos attracted more than a million views guys they're a million view channel and apparently goldman sachs found this credible somehow and they decided to set up a meeting who with well alex piper of course the head of unscripted programming for youtube originals goldman sachs wanted to ask the experts are they really the great thing that we think they are apparently it was supposed to be a zoom call but for some reason alex piper was late and they said hey this guy the got head of youtube originals can't figure out um how zoom works so let's do a conference call instead now this is where things took a a twist and the geniuses at due diligence for goldman sachs actually started to realize maybe um they were being duped here oh this is such a great story as alex piper spoke the man's voice began to sound strange to goldman sachs team as though it had been digitally altered the four people said i wonder and it was at this point that i wondered how obvious it would have to be for these guys to realize you know this was altered like was it just like one of those like alexa voices from amazon like yes they are actually making quite a bit of money at goldman sa not cold and sex over at youtube.com we love them at youtube.com they get a lot of ad revenue so anyways these guys at goldman sachs decide hey this is too weird even for us so they reach out to mr piper and he basically tells him i've never talked to you guys in my life that was somebody impersonating me and of course there's only one person who'd be interested in impersonating them for aussie media ozzy media obviously the big sleuths i guess over at um google decided to get to the bottom of this and they found out that it was actually this guy samir rao the co-founder and chief operating officer of ozzie who could have thought of that i wonder what they said like hey that was you on the phone right uh no it's like the same voice and here's and here's my favorite part okay guess guess what he says is the reason that he impersonated and lied to goldman sachs in order to fake millions of views in order to pretend and get them to buy him out for 40 million dollars can you guess the reason let me give you two options was it because samir rao wanted um 40 million dollars by hook or crook or b was it mental health [Music] if you guessed mental health crisis you'd be right oh no i'm having such a mental health crisis i have to fake millions of views for a 40 million dollar investment guys i don't know what came over me i was feeling a little depressed it's it's my mental health guys by the way this isn't to make light of mental health this is to make light of this con man this is what you call it you call it being a con man you don't call it mental health crisis you call it i i was a con man i wanted to teach you guys yo this guy's standing behind the bodies of so many people with actual mental health issues and he's saying uh i had to cheat you out of 40 million dollars so that's why i'm giving him a hard time on that guys i just want to be clear about that but um mr watson i guess he's associated with ozzy says samir is a valued colleague and a close friend i'm proud that we stood by him while he struggled does that mean you didn't fire him and don't pretend like nobody and ozzy knew like are they trying to pretend they didn't know wait a second i just realized mr watson he's actually the leader of aussie you're telling me the guy mr watson who's in talks with goldman sachs to go ahead and get this investment you're saying he didn't know that samir rao was faking this i'm gonna go ahead and call  on that dude you're just as bad i bet mr watson put it up to it i don't know if that's true i'm just it's wild speculation probably not true i shouldn't say that i'm not gonna say that uh but what i will say is carlos watson he definitely knew how could how could you not know that it's your buddy on the other line like let's say miss like carlos is on one line right and he's like talking to goldman sachs he's like hey alex piper chime in and you hear that you're you're like uh vp or whatever you hear him on the other line be like yeah we're great we're thriving oh i i honestly i know that uh probably no one's gonna go to the jail for this but i say just my opinion just my opinion that's what i say i say all of them just just do a little just just to get a little that i mean honestly it's not that dissimilar from what uh elizabeth holmes did so why would this guy why should this guy get any uh nicer of a treatment i mean i say look dude i say give him what's coming because it can't be legal to uh impersonate someone from like another executive team can it like it's unbelievable to me the way this article talks it talks like oh yeah maybe something happens maybe it doesn't like we don't really know it's private business that's what private business deals like that's what they do right this sounds weird even for me and look if it sounds like i'm being a harsh on goldman sachs here it's because i looked into this youtube channel i did my own two minutes of due diligence here and um i could have called this a fraud from a mile away i mean it's so funny this new york times article spends like half of its time basically saying well it seems irregular that you know they're they don't really seem to be doing as well publicly as pr as they're privately saying but all you really have to do is just go to their youtube channel one time it doesn't take a big data genius to figure out what's going on here 37 views 45 views 16 views 26 views and then on the videos with views right this one with 91 000 views supposedly you go to it and they only have 475 likes and zero comments i mean that is unheard of i don't know if goldman sachs needs to hire me as a due diligence expert over there for youtube but you don't get 91 000 views and zero comments without having to artificially inflate those numbers right whether it be through paid advertising or botting views or some shenanigans basically i've never seen a youtube channel with that bad of engagement unless there's something fake here so i mean i'm gonna go ahead and guess that if you had just left this video without like trying to artificially pump it up to be something it's not you're probably going to see viewership like we saw with the their other videos like 10 views 50 views this is a dead youtube channel that they're trying to sell as being worth 40 million dollars again it happens all the time in silicon valley but it's just incredible to me that i'm not getting that 40 million dollars ladies and gentlemen i mean come on over here we've actually got the stock is pumping over here what are we getting for it nothing and take a listen to some of this uh inspirational genius millennial programming here [Music] if you're alive you eat that may be the most profound thing i've ever heard if you're alive you eat if you're alive you also might breathe guys this is the kind of podcasting you can expect from this channel like holy crap this was so obvious that these guys were fake and it's funny to me that um the only reason they seem to seem to have been found out was this fake call right like if they hadn't done the fake call this is why i'm like giving goldman sachs such a hard time about this is that it's so obvious that they were not what they said they were but it took like this completely ridiculous preposterous situation of like faking a call with youtube in order to get found out when it should have been like two seconds of oh yeah these guys are basically full of it like it like takes like one second and so the fact that they almost basically got 40 million dollars and got out and this guy basically cashed out i guess i mean i don't know it's just absolutely incredible to me and such a like sign of sign of the fact that really hey guys sometimes the experts are not who you think they are right you think they've got it all figured out and actually um monkeys outperform them in the stock market or you find out that mattel buys out a your learning company in what people then call the worst deals of all time and you make this guy seem like some savvy businessman when in actuality he sold you just a bill of goods but anyways that's basically it guys i hope you enjoyed and um i guess yeah my big takeaway is i am for sale for 40 million dollars too actually let me say that if we all get bought out by an investment bank we're all hey we're all going to the top that's all i'm going to say you're all in shareholders dude we're cashing out that's i think what i'm realizing is we should have been faking numbers and courting these deals all along jpmorgan call me dude thanks for watching big investigations coming what a up you're a fraud are you the same no you're not
