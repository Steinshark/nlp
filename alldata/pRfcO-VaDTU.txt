hello and welcome to this video which introduces you to who below um welcome to hubido and this is the online platform which runs my online user group meeting c plus plus online which is you know this is the next meeting for it on tuesday and it also contains some of the basic elements for the conference and i'm going to give you a quick tour through them as you already see there are some banners flying through which are the conferences and my online user group and if you click on them you land exactly there um and now um i'm gonna scroll down and you see that's the agenda of that evening so this is kind of where you see the sessions okay these are sessions and you can join them um i'm a host so you right now see them that i can join them as a host and uh yeah so on that evening we're hosting daisy holman and she'll be giving her cppcon talk uh what you can learn from being too cute uh really looking forward to tuesday and if it's going down a bit more we see like more future things so um this is a featured room uh where we're gonna have probably after her talk at q a so we're gonna have some questions answered after her talk but at some point we have to end the recording and when the recording has ended the session becomes in this online platform or less useless so i'm you know then going to shift the conversation to that room um yeah there you see uh her so if you click on that you get to a profile and there are some excel visitors that's some testing for meeting c plus plus uh 2021 um these are the two sponsors which are uh platinum sponsors thank you for that thank you for having us and thank you for taking bloomberg for that and um i'm later gonna you know when when those booths are set up i'm gonna copy them into the main event um okay so the agenda of wirelessly shows you like know what's what's up next and here we see that when the meeting begins there will be the welcome message and um there's various things you can filter this or you can search it and next point is like the exhibitors like you know the sponsors thanks for sponsoring that you can look at the booths um if i look at my own booths uh yeah this is just a setup to know what what to use you know that they can also sponsor questions um let's go to the launch that's where it gets interesting the lounge is one of the core features which we use in ubilo for the conference that's uh the hallway track where we hang out in midwest folks the central meeting place at the conference is this launch and on the other hand during our user group meetings um the lounge is basically when we start like half an hour early the meetings you can just come there hang out meet people have a conversation meet friends online that you maybe met through conferences your user group or online you know um and i'm gonna join this table where i already have my test account sitting and yeah so if you want to join a table you need to click one of those uh boxes like one of those seats and now it will uh yeah show me this is the microphone and this is your audio settings and then you click join and then you see that it loads and here we are in the setting and this pop-up is new that you have to give the permission which i did and now you can talk to the other person in my case that's the lamp upstairs uh which sits in front of my camera hi lamp um yeah so one attendee brought up that you cannot see the names when you kind of you know hang here in this um that's true and i already gave feedback to a video to that but there's a different mode where you see the names and this mode um can be nicer for some folks maybe it's more used for you um and the other mode is more laid back where you just you know have a conversation with folks and if you know the folks that you don't need their names but it would be nice to have them let me show you like a place where you can uh find them um if you go into the menu uh there's a chat as you see and also there's a people tab and here you can see um that there is uh you know the other account sitting there but of course there's no indication because you see the video you don't see the the icon or they what they have so yeah um but again then there is this um this view where you can see the names and yeah you can of course you mute yourself which you probably should do if you're not talking in an online setting as we're all used to now you can turn off your camera if you don't want to be seen or just don't have little red lights you can share something to demo so demos on those tables are possible and i want it if you want to show code that's the place to go and there are some settings which are just basically the the settings you saw when i joined the table um also that's what i'm going to press and i'll leave that here in a second um i want to point quickly out the meeting timer is a feature of remo which you see down here in the taskbar which i cannot turn off it is a feature of the launch and that's what limits the meetings in the lounge if you join a table you see this timer going down and that's the length of the meeting which goes on there um i want to point out that you can join our conversations here free table lists okay there's no such thing as a closed table and you cannot close off a table so by default all tables are public and you can join them um i'm gonna offer like tables for two and four four and for eight and for sixteen that's what is possible in the lounge this rainbow um that also knows and um so if you want to have a more private conversation you can take a two table or four table um when this timer counts down and i set it to the maximum that you have a long conversation possibly then you're just kicked out and you will be in the launch view the same as when you leave the table and then you just join the table again and the timer starts again and you have another hour to talk it's really not that much to to to you know to know about um now i'm leaving it so that's basically also what happens you get a pop-up telling you that the meeting has ended and then you are back in the launch okay and then you know um you just join the same table or join a different table um the advantage that this has is that somebody's sitting at a table but being inactive gets kicked out of their time and then doesn't join again and so people don't block seats on tables like um imagine there's a table with with i don't know jana with sean uh with all the famous people you know and there's just always people sitting on and you want to have a spot and that's your chance when the meeting time ends uh what i cannot show you right now is um when there is a meeting ongoing that's always when at least two people sit on this table then this timer gets started um when you're in the lounge and you see already a table where a meeting is ongoing you can see the timer from here from the launch okay no you don't have to join the table to see that the timer is like 10 minutes to go and then you know people might end the conversation or join the table again usually they join that's our experience with the last meetings uh let me quickly go to rooms i i would like to show that feature to you but i can't join that room right now i probably will set up a different video where i will make a room joinable um the the room is very similar to the other things i've showed you um the room is either moderated or it's free and then everybody can just join and share the video and chat and and talk um and the last thing i'm gonna do is i'm quickly going to go in [Music] as a host into my welcome message now again we see that uh something is loading and my camera is turned off let's leave it that way and that's it um yeah and here i can you know add various things like um yeah this is the the video set up basic behind the stage i'm not gonna go into that i'm gonna make a viewer what i wanted to show you is this is and i hope i can only come here to uh to done that through through the story um so there's very saying there's actually kind of last questions um and see this is the session um you can take notes and um general chat and yeah then you can see like here well that me and just don't even have the general event feed to chapter subs so um there's there's to explore this would be the um direction measures um check when you want to set up and this is so below um i'm looking forward to host a lot of meetings and friend versions of things online in the online world so thank you for watching and i'm happy to see you soon and maybe a lot of you i've seen conferences thank you and with this video
