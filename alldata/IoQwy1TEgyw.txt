so these past two weeks have been pretty crazy in exactly 14 days i've gone from 20 subscribers to 1252. i didn't have any existing audience in any other social media i didn't benefit from any external promotion i didn't have any big youtuber friends who pushed my channel or anything like that no no completely organically from zero to more than one thousand in two weeks what how did that what how did that happen i don't even really know but in this video i wanted to quickly discuss sort of my theories around maybe why this channel was successful because what's actually interesting is that i had a different youtube channel for quite a while and i wasn't really seeing any traction i was making videos for around nine months on this other channel where i've now deleted all the videos and it took me nine months to get to 475 subscribers whereas on this channel it took me two weeks to get to a thousand so what the actual okay so it turns out i was making the exact same mistake that literally everyone who starts youtube makes in the beginning i was not focusing on a specific target audience so my other channel was making a lot of videos like travel vlogs and then i'd make one about social media that made one about productivity it's really difficult to build any sort of community like that and the second mistake i was making i wasn't making videos that i was actually passionate about and i know this is the thing that literally every youtuber will tell you you need to be making videos about something that you actually care about because it's really going to come across on these videos i think you guys can tell that i really actually care about coding and programming and technology and computer science those are topics that i actually really really want to learn and i'm really passionate about sort of motivating other people to get into this field as well for many reasons which i talk about on this channel so essentially for eight months i was making the exact errors that every youtuber tells you not to do but there is something else as well i am like borderline obsessed with youtube as a platform like i am such a huge youtube superfan and i listen to a lot of these big youtubers on podcasts and their videos and stuff and i'm really passionate about learning about this topic in general i think that also probably helped me a lot because sort of over time i've grown to think like these other big youtubers and sort of understand how they think and like how they think about creating content so that now for my own videos i could apply a lot of that stuff so i think that's helped a lot as well to get 1000 subscribers in just two weeks but i would say the most important thing about growing a youtube channel at least growing as fast as i did is that you need to be unique in some kind of way but let me just explain that because it's slightly different than what you might think a lot of people think that in order to have a successful youtube channel you need to find some obscure niche that no one else has done before and that can actually be really bad advice because if some niche is popular it means that there's demand for that kind of content so you might go and make content about i don't know soap you might be the first ever soap youtuber but the reason why there's no other big soap youtubers is probably just because people don't want to watch soap videos what you actually really want to do is speak a very popular niche like i've done with computer science and programming this is a very popular niche with a lot of people there and then find some way to stand out in that is not now obviously the more popular the niche is the more people they already are being unique in their own ways the less room there probably is for someone else and the less easy it is to find a unique angle on that is absolutely that doesn't mean they cannot be done on my other channel i was doing a lot of travel videos for example and travel is a super super saturated niche i could not find a way to really stand out from the crowd in the travel niche whereas on the programming niche i noticed that there's a lot of people in the world who want to self-teach computer science who are self-taught and that kind of stuff but there's not that many people talking about it on youtube especially a lot of the videos that i'm making about self-teaching computer science i couldn't really see anyone else on youtube doing that and i realized that in general the process of finding something like that that there is a demand for and that no one else is doing is very hard and that's just up to you to find that but that's not the only way to be unique being unique could just mean having a really unique personality a lot of channels that i've seen grow mostly grow because they have a really engaging personality and creator is really able to connect with the audience and if you can do that it almost doesn't even matter what you're making videos about because your personality will stand out on its own but one good way you can think about finding that sort of area where there's demand for some kind of content but not necessarily a lot of supply think about what sort of unfair advantages could you exploit for example if you are a real estate agent that's something that not everyone can make videos about because inherently you need to be a real estate agent before you can make videos about life as a real estate agent but i would argue that there's a lot of people who would be very interested in following your life as a real estate agent but there's inherently going to be a lot less competition for that kind of content than for i don't know travel vlogs for example think about what you have that other people could find interesting and not everyone can just go ahead and do for me i learn coding very quickly i'm self-changing computer science and i'm going to be a software engineer so really out of that at least the fact that i'm a software engineer and i learn how to code very quickly is inherently something that not everyone can make videos about because you need to do those things and be a software engineer before you can do that and lastly especially in the beginning you really want to be thinking about how you can provide value when people don't know you they're really only going to watch you if they think they can get some kind of value out of your videos now value can mean entertainment it can be education but for example for me in my first ever video that's now blowing up i was offering a free notion template for people to self teach computer science and it turns out that people really found that useful and the sort of philosophy i have for all of my videos is how can i provide something to you guys that you can get value from because you might think that because i was making videos for eight months on this other channel and it never succeeded that it was a waste of time for me that i should have just started this from the get-go and you'd be right but also i don't consider it a waste of time at all because making these videos for eight months allowed me to sort of learn a lot about video editing and about the process of making videos so by the time i started this channel i was already pretty decent at the video production process and by pretty decent i mean more like moderately non absolutely terrible so that from the start on this channel i'm actually talking about the things i want to talk about i can make videos that are quality wise not absolutely terrible which helps and i will tell you that making good videos and making high quality videos is actually really freaking difficult it takes so much effort like that's really why i enjoy it i talk about a lot on this channel with relation to coding the reason i enjoy coding is because it's so hard i love learning things that are really hard and making great videos is really freaking difficult and i still pretty much don't know what i'm doing so that's why i'm so excited to make youtube videos i will either succeed on this channel or i will die trying because that is how passionate i am about the process of trying to make videos that are pretty good so hopefully i'll get there so those are the things that i think led to my channel growing to 1 000 subscribers in two weeks on to 10k
