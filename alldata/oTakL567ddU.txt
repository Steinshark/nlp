over the course of my career as a documentary filmmaker there's been one thing that's come with me on every single job no matter what my role was i brought it when i was a camera assistant i brought it when i was running a b cam and i still bring it with me today when i'm a serious dp it's not a camera because i've gone through four different systems since i started it's also not a fancy light because there are a lot of jobs where i don't bring any lighting gear at all and it is definitely not a drone because those things are updated and become obsolete faster than any other piece of gear i know of actually the piece of kit i bring with me most often doesn't have any electronic parts at all and costs less than a single memory card for my sony fx6 it's this the tool bag i put together just after my first job as an ac and have carried around the world with me since it's not the most glamorous thing in my bag but every documentary filmmaker out there should have one of these and in this video i'm gonna go into what i have in mind and what the essential items are you need to make a future-proof toolkit of your own let's get into it [Music] hey guys welcome back and if you're new here my name is luke forsyth documentary cinematographer and filmmaker and on this channel i teach the skills i've learned over 10 years of working as a documentary filmmaker and photographer on one of the very first camera assistant jobs i ever got on a real documentary production i'll never forget the look of rage on the dp's face when he asked me to build up the camera rig in the morning and i told him that i didn't have any tools he'd been in the business for over 20 years and was used to working with professionals to be honest i might have misrepresented my skill set a little bit to get the job in the first place luckily he didn't throw me off this set though i think he thought about it and if he had a better option he might have instead he lent me his own tools and told me to get my act together asap i made a list of all the stuff he had and then i went home that night and ordered exactly the same things as he had over the years i've worked with other dps and have picked up a few more useful items along the way but the basics are pretty much unchanged since that day so what do you need for a toolkit that will cover you in almost any situation well obviously the first thing you need is something to carry it all in it's all well and good to have a bunch of tools but if they aren't in one place you're never going to find what you're looking for when there's an emergency when the base plate falls off a tripod in the middle of an important interview the last thing you want to do is be rooting through all of your bags frantically while a pissed off director watches i went with this one from cinebags i think it's called the cb ac pouch or cb3 something like that i think it was just over 40 bucks there's a bunch of other brands with their own version of this like setware and portabrace and a bunch of other no-name alternatives you'd probably be fine with any of them i went with this one because i'd used some cinebag stuff before and liked it but mostly because it was the top search result on b h photo when i search for ac pouch i'm pretty sure it still is whatever you pick i'd say just make sure it has good velcro and stays closed because the cheap ones will pop open in your bag and after a while your stuff will scatter everywhere i'd also get one with a belt loop so you can choose whether you want to wear it on your hip or just have it in a bag i've been pretty happy with this one and i guess i'd recommend it but you'd be fine with anything really what matters most is what's inside so the first and most important thing is one of these a multi-tool every filmmaker needs one of these but especially filmmakers that are interested in documentaries they can be used for so many things that a lot of people on big sets just carry one on their hip all the time i use a leatherman wave because it comes with a bunch of screwdriver attachments there are other companies who make multi-tools but leatherman is so popular that a lot of the time people will just ask you for a leatherman rather than a multi-tool kind of like how people ask for kleenex instead of tissue you can't go wrong with one of these and it's incredibly hard to break i'm pretty sure they have a 25 year warranty or something insane like that they're about a hundred bucks which i know isn't super cheap but it is the most expensive thing in this pouch and as long as you don't use it you'll have it for years and while we're talking about losing them pro tip here don't forget these things in your carry-on luggage before you go to the airport because i have lost more than one of these to airport security and it sucks every single time all right moving down the list uh to the next thing i use the most would probably be these things a heavy duty set of allen keys a surprising number of things on cameras use hex bolts and most multi-tools won't cover you you can get a little attachment for some leathermans but they're small and finicky and you're really better off just having a dedicated set of allen keys you can get these for as little as a couple dollars on amazon though i'd say definitely get a folding set like this one rather than the loose ones because they're much easier to keep track of you can get a lot more leverage with the handle on really tight bolts i'd say get a set of around eight or ten different sizes and that would cover you for pretty much everything the next thing in here is a rocket blower that i've had since my days as a photojournalist dust and sand are the enemy of cameras and when you're shooting docks like i do your cameras get dirty a blower will help you deal with it and get small stuff off your camera and lenses without touching them it's also way less spitty i guess is the word than blowing on it with your mouth and no one really wants spit on their lens anyways i think the company who makes these geodos i think it's called is the original patent holder and they charge between 10 and 20 bucks for theirs you can probably go with a knockoff brand and probably not notice much of a difference at all i push the nozzle of this back inside so it's easier to carry and it's pretty easy to pull back out when you need to use it i also carry a toothbrush and paint brushes as well sometimes really thick dirt or dust won't come off at the rocket blower alone and when that happens these guys come in really handy you can get into all the little cracks and holes on your camera and i use these all the time fun tip the toothbrush can also get the dirt out of those tiny little holes on the bottom of your iphone where the speakers are so it's useful outside of filmmaking too i also keep a bottle of cleaning spray and a pack of lens tissues in here these are for cleaning lenses after your ac or just a curious little kid touches the front of your lens by accident and there's really no better way to get smudges off glass i've definitely used my t-shirt in a pinch but since i don't use uv filters on my lenses this can be a bit dangerous your shirt can also leave particles behind as well and those microfiber cloth things get so wet and dirty over the course of a day they're not much use these little tearaway sheets don't leave anything behind and there's so many of them in a pack you don't really need to worry about losing them i have some from roscoe here but there are lots of other companies who make them i think a pack of a hundred is about five dollars here's another hot tip they're also pretty much the same thing as the paper people use on their faces for oily skin and they work really well to get the shine off someone's face before an interview before we start i'll often give one to an interview subject and tell them to wipe down their nose and cheeks and it'll make them look way less shiny under bright lights i actually did this to myself before i started filming this video so let me know in the comments how i look what else do i have in here oh in this back pocket here i keep bongo ties if you've never seen these things before bongo ties are insanely useful they are basically just industrial plastic bands with this little thing on the end that looks like a bongo drum kind of you can use them basically to attach anything to anything and in my entire career i've probably only seen two break you can get a pack of these for about 10 bucks and i actually found them so useful i made an entire youtube short about different ways you can use bongo ties just pick up a pack of them keep them in your bag and believe me you'll use them up at the front here i have a bunch of pens and markers normal pens dry erase markers for whenever come up against a slate and sharpies probably don't have to explain what a sharpie is but they are super useful in filmmaking i use them a lot to label memory cards before handing them to an ac or an editor or for labeling pretty much anything oh another pro tip here wrap some gaffer tape around the end of the sharpie and you'll always have some on hand if you need in the pinch i'm going to roll with these tips today if you're working as a camera assistant instead of as a dp you could also hang some rolls of tape from this uh loop for easy access when i'd ac i used to try and have a roll of black gaff a roll of white gaff and a roll of paper tape for sticking on cards or cameras or anything you don't want to get glue on for some reason people like to think that gaff tape is non-damaging that's not true at all it will rip the paint off someone's wall and leave sticky residue on all your gear if it gets warm so for delicate things go with paper tape or masking tape all the way lastly right at the bottom here i have this cheap keychain flashlight in case you need to work in the dark and attached to it is a tripod plate just as an emergency redundancy because a shaky tripod plate is never a good thing i think that's pretty much it over the years this kit hasn't changed very much and with these things i can sort out pretty much any situation from field repairs to media management there's no tech in here to go out of date and once you get yourself a kit that works you're going to be able to use it for a long long time so that's my take on the ultimate filmmakers tool pouch i'm curious if anyone has anything in theirs that i've never thought of if you do let me know what it is in the comments so i can add it to mine and if you liked that video you might like this one about what i think is the ultimate filmmaker's backpack so you can put the tool pouch inside of something when you're shooting see ya [Music] you
