it might even be if you want to talk about it kind of mystically or spiritually that that we can somehow sense this thing being born around us and that's part of the confusion of the moment yeah something else is in control at this point and it isn't really us anymore these systems have outrun us you know the the machine is much bigger than us and to some degree it's starting to not need us as much as we thought it did [Music] this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world i mean obviously following your newsletter just overjoyed uh getting it every time and so i was hoping that we could talk a little bit about your project right now and what you're doing because i think when we talked last time you hadn't yet started um yeah i think i was just kind of yeah thought maybe just starting maybe yeah i think i was just starting off but i wasn't sure where it was going to go but it's kind of yeah still not quite sure where it's going but i more or less know but yeah it's uh it's been it's been really interesting actually and you know the world has changed so much like we just said exactly in a year it's like it's like trying to half the challenge is just keeping up with what the hell is going on yeah yeah and doing it talk about current affairs much and staying in touch with knowing what's going on and then not letting it not totally suck you into yeah that's that's the big challenge yeah i mean i i think uh you're very wise not to engage in current affairs very much on your channel actually it's the way it's the way to do it you have to just keep that same distance from it you know yeah i'm trying it's i i was a little more involved with what was going on here with the you know because i felt like it was more grounded like i had my feet on the ground i had a sense of what was going on and the consequences of the decisions of the government in terms of the covet actions and stuff so i felt like i was that it was fine to be more involved a little more active in that i even went to the the trucker participated twice in the trucker protest all right okay yeah how was it i was really following that it was very really interesting and weird what was going on there it was astounding i mean it was astounding because it really revealed the disjoint between the narrative and what was actually happening i mean you go you went there it was amazing and not only was it amazing but you could find hours and hours of people streaming you know you can go online on youtube and find people walking around the protest for five hours at a time every day and so you can know what was actually going on but nonetheless it didn't matter in terms of the narrative and so it was astounding it's a great revelation isn't it so maybe it's one of the things we could talk about but it was the same with brexit in britain you know exactly the same that was supposedly a fascist uprising and then you actually went to see what was going on and funnily enough it was nothing of the kind exactly it's the same narrative it's just rolled out you know yeah all right so you got to be the testing ground there didn't you for the uh for the new bios bio state that's what it that's definitely what it feels like it's strange to think that canada is somehow uh let's say the the center of anything in terms of narrative but it seems like it just happened also because our prime minister is so sold to the whole thing like he's just so completely sold and we should have known i mean he's been saying things for 10 years that for since he's been you know in politics he's been saying the same thing and you know that what what he's saying what it means you know when you when he says something like we are the first post-national nation yeah and when you hear it at first you're thinking oh you know he he doesn't want nationalism he doesn't want that i understand that but then when you you realize oh what it means in terms of globalism you think okay so that's what that means yeah yeah hiding in plain sight exactly that's what it feels like so yeah all right so i mean um i think that if you're okay i'm actually already recording i think we could just keep going people know who you are everybody knows i think by now uh who paul king's north is let me introduce you paul kingsworthy is a writer and uh we i had him on my channel before he's written several novels but recently he's been writing a wonderful sub stack that i keep telling people subscribe to paul's sub stack because he looks at the situation with a a piercing insight he doesn't give in to extremes but he is also has a has a very keen look on what is going on what it means for us as as humans what it means for us as as christians as people living in this this world trying to kind of find our place and make sense and so i was hoping that we could talk about that a little bit what your recent project is you know also get a sense of what it's been attracting to you because i imagine all of a sudden your horizon of people that are contacting you that are you know discussing with you has has changed in the past few months and so i would really like to to get a sense of that so maybe we could start with that and you can tell us what was the impetus behind these this this sub stack and what you know what is it that's kind of driving you as you're writing these articles yeah well it's always it's always a challenge for a writer to know what's driving him but really for the past 25 years i suppose since i started writing i've been writing pretty much about the same thing even though i didn't necessarily know it consciously and that that that's true of my fiction and my non-fiction as well actually and the thing i am writing about is the manifestation of this uh giant system of control technological system of control state control corporate control and all the rest of the manifestation of that versus the kind of human scale way of life that maybe is is more traditional but also is is still very excellent in large parts of the world and i started off writing that writing about that as a young kind of environmental activist i suppose very much a man of the left not that i've ever liked putting myself into boxes but you know my first book was a kind of very much a kind of idealistic young man's anti-globalization tract and i spent a long time traveling the world and and visiting communities that were kind of resisting corporate capitalism and the spread of this thing and i've really spent as i said the last 25 years writing about that from different perspectives and in different ways um and i suppose my politics have changed a little bit although actually fundamentally i still believe the same things i did when i was 19. um but what i've seen what i've come to see is i suppose a much broader perspective of what's going on um and over just over the last couple of years um with what happened with uh with the coveted pandemic in the way that that was dealt with now what's going on in the ukraine and and more broadly than that actually just the the the kind of very very rapid rollout of this technological society very interconnected very technological very uh very much openly now monitoring people and controlling people and shutting people down if they don't have the correct perspective it's become very much clearer that the thing that i've been writing about for a long time is is manifesting very kind of publicly everywhere now you know whatever you think of say a vaccine passport system whether you think that's a good or a bad idea that's very clearly something that could not have happened even five or ten years ago the technology wasn't available the ability to do it wasn't available similarly with say shutting russia out of the global financial system again whether or not you think that's good or a bad thing it's now a possible thing um whether whatever you think of what your government did in canada with the truckers protest and the ability to remove people from the financial system if they don't like the government's uh actions again that's a that's a thing that is now happening in a way that it hasn't been happening at least in the west before and so this sub stack i'm writing is really just kind of a way of well firstly i i i just write to get things out of my head otherwise i'm going to go mad i mean that's funny fundamentally certainly in non-fiction terms i mean fiction is much more creative and enjoyable but non-fiction you're trying to work out what the hell's going on so i'm really trying to outline this thing that i i've called the machine which is a term that was coined by greater writers than me in the past from dh lawrence to george orwell to just describe this almost impossible to pin down but very obvious manifestation of technological control that's been growing for hundreds of years but is now accelerating and i'm trying to work out what it is what it means what the alternatives are to it if there are any um and also somebody who's who's a christian um but quite a new christian i'm trying to to understand what that means in the context of the christian faith and more broadly what's the spiritual perspective on it because increasingly it's obvious to me that this is actually a spiritual crisis more than anything else so so yeah that's quite a lot to be going on with isn't it no but i think it's wonderful and i felt that it's been very complementary to the things that i've been talking about in terms of the notion of the the system of the beast let's say i've used i kind of use apocalyptic terms which i i guess scares people because people think i'm always saying it's the end of the world which who knows maybe it is but that's really not the point it's mostly about showing that in scripture there is a pattern that that relates directly to the notion of technology and control and which begins with the idea of the mark of cain uh writing is actually part of this this technological system and it moves into the city of kane into weapons into civilization itself which contains in it you could say something like the seed of cain it means that civilization isn't all bad but it never that necessarily has an aspect of it which is about the problem of inclusion and exclusion and the problem of of controlling your borders and controlling you know uh what is inside and giving yourself power in order to do that it's an inevitable part it's kind of an inevitable part of civilization but one which has a very dark aspect and as technical capacity grows we always see it as an increase in power which it is of course it's an increase in power but that means that those that wield political power are always always their powers increasing as technical capacity is increasing as well and so as we so i actually frame it as a i frame it as both the machine in terms of control but also it's it's like balance with a weird anarchism it's as if there's on the one hand this sense that you should be completely free to do to be to to do whatever you want that there's no limit on you and your identity and whatever you want to be but that in order for that to that narrative to be possible there's a counter narrative which is always growing with it which is that you always have to be completely safe and complete everything has to be safe and in in a very very uh secure secured area so that you can experiment all that craziness because obviously in the normal traditional world right you can't just be whatever you want because you'll die of hunger right you're just not going to eat you won't you have to stay connected to other people in the community in order for for the community for you to exist but in this world it's like it's a vacillation between i'm a completely idiosyncratic being that does whatever they want and you know has can express myself in whatever manner i want but at the same time i live at the same time in a world that is completely controlling me and setting down you know uh limits that if you cross them at this point right you're you're excluded in ways that would not have been possible before when money becomes digital you know i can't i won't be able to you know i won't be able to unless we actually start bartering again which might actually happen at some point but if money is digital unless i have hide you know a chicken hiding i can't i won't be able to participate in the financial system i won't be able to buy i won't be able to sell so yeah well i've got i've got a load of chickens outside and they lay a lot of eggs so you're too far away to share them with unfortunately but at least but that's something but it's um civil civilization as a control system has always been a control system and all civilizations from rome to babylon as you mentioned obviously are control systems and this one is the most effective and the most global and the most technologically advanced and so it means that the things that uh the babylonian kings or the pharaohs might have liked to do to control their population are now possible um and if you have a system that is this centralized and which is this dependent on say global supply chains and is this dependent on technology and there's also this dependent on growth because a capitalist economic system requires endless growth and in order to keep that going um it's necessary to to you know do all sorts of things for managing population numbers to managing industrial output to managing trade you can't allow any of the balls to drop to the floor otherwise the whole thing potentially falls apart so the need and the desire for control just grows and grows and grows and yet at the same time as you say you have this kind of on the one hand extreme coercion and on the other hand kind of extreme liberalism or or or individualism in which on the one hand yeah we can be anything we want literally anything we can imagine we can redefine our own bodies if we if we feel like we've just done that but at the same time if you cross any of the kind of red lines that are drawn by the by the culture then then you're dead meat and and you could literally be you can have your bank account taken away and this is happening to people um and so you've got this sort of strange combination of extreme liberalism and extreme illiberalism at the same time and it's it messes with the head actually i mean you talk about um you know different people writing to me but maybe the common i mean i have people from right across the spect from writing to me all the time and a lot of the common maybe the common factor that people will often come out with is i just have no idea what the hell is going on and and people tell me at least sometimes that they value what i'm writing because i'm trying to work that out and they find it useful to sort of come along with me but it is just so immensely confusing because so many of the things which as you say maybe in a more customary society people will just live with family community local level institutions roots in a place all of these things that would define most traditional societies around the world they've all been demolished and so we're left with on the one hand the individual and on the other hand the increasingly powerful state which has a kind of corporate arm and a media arm and that that's almost become one blob of power corporations the state and the mass media and then there's us little people and depending on where we live in the world we've got more or less of a kind of rooted community around us but fundamentally the whole the whole thing is reduced to a binary of you know powerful state up here and the little person down here and so that's how you get this weird thing in which you can define your own reality but at the same time you're more controlled than you've ever been and it's extremely confusing and it and it's kind of rushing in that direction all the time and um the other thing to think about is just the huge uh wave of imagery that we're battered with all the time the the possibility now through social media and the web to just give us endless images i mean the war in ukraine is a great example of this has ever has any war ever been kind of so relentlessly covered and live streamed you know you can get this diet of horrible you know images and and news and conflicting ideas and opinions all the time and it's almost impossible to you know i long for the old days where you turned the bbc on and the man would tell you what was going on and that was the news and they'd there'd be a war reporter and there he was and he would he would say this is what's happened here um and it's yeah so you've got all these kind of uh these forces coming at your consciousness from so many different directions and i think increasingly a lot of people just find it almost impossible to to manage it actually just to navigate the whole system yeah i mean i think the way you present it as the two extremes i think that that's the key is that a normal kind of traditional what i call this kind of symbolic world is a is a constant negotiation between levels of existence so you know you exist in these embedded communities so you have your you know you have your friends and your family and that creates a kind of cohesion and then that's embedded in churches or embedded in community groups embedded in villages and towns and you know and and ultimately it does reach up it can reach out very high in terms of empire in terms of nation but because you have these buffered realities then you know at the point where sometimes the king might become tyrannical you can find some solace and some protection in your family or in these more embedded communities but because of the way that the system is getting set up because of the fact that the state in many of our countries the state has become the the sole arbiter of all your existence right it's the it's the it's this it decides pretty much everything about you know how you're going to live your life then you have these two extremes where the state becomes more and more powerful the the the human beings become more and more disconnected from each other and uh then then the the power becomes absolute but people don't feel it so much i mean uh until until they do right they don't feel it until they do if they're like you said if they're inside then they're okay and they feel like they can do whatever they want they can watch whatever netflix show they want they can you know they can consume as much in any manner they like but as soon as sometimes the face of the system shows itself and i think that that's something that during kobit it has you know that something happened for it was funny like when justin trudeau basically shut down people's bank accounts i think that i don't know exactly what happened we don't know what happened in the background of that but it seems like he let the mask slip a little too much for some people because all of a sudden in a week later they they they pulled back or a week and a half later but i think they realized that this is telling people we can do this not only we can do this we're going to do it we're going to do it increasingly and and the russia situation is the same like watching people in russia get there going to the store and then using apple pay and it doesn't work do you think that that's only going to be used outside that it's not going to be used inside it was it happened just a month ago in canada so of course it's going to be used on you and the short-sightedness is astonishing i mean i have you know i have say friends on on the liberal left my old activist buddies and i see some of them out there you know cheering on what trudeau did because they brought into the line that this is just a bunch of fascists who turned up to wave swastikas and so it's great that he can shut them down now even if that was true which as far as i could see it wasn't true at all but even if it had been true even if it had been a fascist rally or whatever are you still really comfortable with the government doing that do you think that that won't be used elsewhere do you do you trust any authority at all to have that degree of power over anyone you've got to be very short-sighted to do that i mean it's interesting looking at trudeau from where i am because i'm no no expert on canada but he's you know he's almost a poster boy for how to be a liberal isn't he in in in the global sense you know he said he said he says all the right things and yet at the same time he's just used the most authoritarian powers in in any modern democracy that i can that i can see but people don't under they don't realize i think it's also there's a sense in which people are just don't know history or don't actually totally understand seem to not understand how democracy works or how systems work and so you know i i always use an extreme example and i tell people you know if i if i rape a child they won't take away my bank account like if i go out in the street and i start killing slashing people's throats they're not going to take away my bank account you understand that so why do you think that it's normal to take away bank accounts like that's insane to think that you will actually cut people out of the capacity to to pay for and people just thought it was a normal thing to do and to do it against your political enemies that's insane it's like we're reaching levels that are hard to describe well that's the thing that's new and it's it's like this stuff has been normalized something has happened over the last two years where this kind of firstly society has become incredibly tribal in the west i mean we already had this culture war brewing in america which has come roaring over into europe as well especially into into britain um less so where i live in ireland thank the lord but i'm hoping that will last but you already had this culture war after trump was elected and bricks it happened in britain there were already all these divisions opening up and people weren't listening to each other at all um but it's it's gone into hyperdrive over covid because you know the war against the unvaccinated and the so-called anti-vaxxers was astonishing you know i'm not vaccinated myself so i had to sit here and uh be excluded from the life of my society for six months for no obvious scientific reason at all um but even if there had been you know even even if the arguments for that had been legitimate which in my view they weren't it was still done without question with no discussion and with a complete media blackout on any dissenting views no conversation um in some countries obviously it was worse they had mandatory vaccination in other places and it was so normalized that it seems to me now that you know wherever you are on that on whichever kind of side of this fake battle that you've decided to put yourself on it's increasingly possible for you to justify extreme measures against the guys that you've decided the bad ones and there's this kind of extreme moralism on the one hand where your enemies are not just wrong but they're evil and and then as we as we were saying that's coupled with the ability to use power technological power especially in a way that hasn't been possible before and then at the same time you have this kind of development of the the sort of the moral state in which the state is taking uh very clear lines on what is acceptable to say what is not acceptable to say what are moral positions how you should behave at work how you should relate to each other in a way that states have never really done before at least to this degree you combine all of that and we're going into a situation where people nobody's listening to each other everybody wants a war or at least a lot of people do especially the ones on twitter apparently social media sites you know social media sites have so much power and influence just for basically a bunch of people sounding off on the internet which is what they were what they are the ability of those sites to effectively destroy people's lives and reputation sometimes yeah it's astonishing so you've got all this stuff kind of converging at hyper speed and it's quite frightening i don't know where it ends because it you ask yourself how could you defuse this and i don't know how you can diffuse it in the context of a culture that's that's disintegrating i think and an economy that's starting to fall apart uh with a kind of ecological background of disintegration as well it's it's difficult to know you know there's certainly no returning to whatever period you thought was normal put it that way no it doesn't seem like that's for sure at this point we're not going back to anything and people have to stop thinking it's going to to return you know two years after the beginning of kovid most of the countries still have emergency powers and they keep pushing back when they're going to let that go and why would they let that go we let them have it for two years so i i mean maybe they will for a little little moment just to make people feel like made people feel like they're doing something but uh you know the track is set the pattern is has been accepted and so by now um it seems like only a very very large crisis will be able to to kind of pull us back from what is happening and so i don't necessarily yeah i don't anticipate that with great joy but it's it seems like it's not going to it's not going to return without some massive crisis a very big one it will sadly have to be very big for it to to pull back and so in the meantime i think you know i think that rods rodriguez kind of idea for the benedict option all of a sudden becomes more and more salient for us because there is really nothing else you can do besides try to make yourself resilient you know in terms of human connections in this in your actual physical space you know to to create uh alternative networks besides the one that are mediated by by the state and by the banks and by all of these systems obviously we can't avoid it we're so trapped we're so caught into it we can't avoid it but we can at least be conscious and try to find try to find other solutions to be more resilient as this is uh as this is moving forward yeah and it's interesting that you know you mentioned the benedict option and that's again that's a sort of um it's a variation on things that have been happening forever almost i mean i i like the idea of the benefit option but i was thinking recently that we also need an anthony option you know people who are just going to go to the desert live in caves you know that came first the desert fathers but you know also you know you could look back to the look back to the 60s and the intentional communities that were created by you know people broadly i suppose from the left rather than the conservative movement or whatever but it's not you know you could you can look at that wherever you come from wherever you place yourself on any spectrum if they're even real things um yeah you can look at the system that's developing around you and you're going to have to say to yourself right how can i best avoid this way that i can escape it whether that's a physical escape which it probably has to be i think increasingly as much as possible but also you know spiritual escape and i think that has to be about forming communities with others you know in some way and and being you know even if there's there's a lot of value in even just online communities of people who think the same as you but also you know practical physical realities of places where people are gathering to do things differently um and uh yeah it's it's interesting that as i say you can be you can be from any uh sort of from a different perspective from different place on this on the cultural spectrum but you can see that that's very clear that that's what's going to have to happen and that's almost interestingly it feels like a sort of in invitation to to recreate real community again in places i think so exist anymore and that's you know if you want to look on the bright side of all this horror we've been talking about that's what it is you know it's like okay we've got to this point where this civilization is so inhuman and impressive to everyone who doesn't conform to its increasingly narrow kind of bandwidth of what you're allowed to say and do um you just got to get the hell out you know you've got to tune in turn on and drop out as the hippies used to say you're totally right i felt we we had the experience here where because of the measures and because of as the measures we're moving towards church especially we're moving towards you know legislating who can go to church and who can't go to church luckily i mean luckily you know by the grace of god our church passed the kobe test because for some churches i think some churches in canada they'll never get back they'll never get over what happened because those that impose the vaccine passport on their own members and we're forced to have someone at the door checking you and and knowing that if you can't pass this test you have to go go back home um i don't think those churches are gonna survive i don't think i mean i think they might kind of coast for a while but i don't think they'll ultimately survive the the their own spiritual decisions you know but luckily our parish did and for that we are much stronger than we were at the outset of covid and it was so hard you know we lost our buildings because nobody wanted to rent to people anymore and you know it was like this constant wheel of obstacles but because of it you know our parish has become stronger and more deliberate and so i think that hopefully people can take that as and the same with like even some friendships we have it feels like we became way more deliberate about our friendships and about the connections that we have because we realize that this is everything else might be taken away but this is the most precious thing yeah no i had a similar experience actually i mean luckily the i mean i'm a member of the romanian church here in ireland and so you know the orthodox churches here are quite different i think from uh say the catholic church partly because they're immigrant churches and so they they sort of slightly operate under the radar but it's you know it's a different it's a different feel but we didn't have you know i felt the same that you know people at the same time as people weren't discussing this in the church at all i mean people discuss it outside but it wasn't something that came into the liturgy or something or into sermons you know vaccines or whatever people had different opinions and who knows but nobody was asking anyone else who was vaccinated that never happened i've never seen that nobody you know nobody cares no one's going to make that judgment um and yeah absolutely you come out of that with a strong sense of what's actually real here and who's real and who who is going to treat you like a human being you know i've certainly lost friends over my the writing that i did about the about facts vaccine mandates especially a lot of my old lefty friends they now think i'm i don't know what they think i am but i'm i'm perceived right a right-wing conspiracy theorist of some kind yeah and that's it i have a right-wing conspiracy theorist and that's very interesting to me because as far as i can see i'm saying the same things i'm saying 25 years ago on this subject right aren't you the left aren't you supposed to be against the state power aren't you supposed to be suspicious of big farmer aren't you supposed to be suspicious of big tech isn't that the whole almost the entire point of the left how come you've allied yourself with these guys and i still cannot work that out i mean the trajectory of some people on the left who are now accusing people who are saying what they said 10 years ago of being fascists i mean i cannot get into my head quite what shift has been made there but it's just part of the general weirdness of the whole situation a lot of the people who used to spend their time raging against state power are radical authoritarians now they want the state to clamp down on almost everything as far as i can see i've heard people who i used to think were anti-capitalist activists arguing for the state to jail people who aren't vaccinated it's just it's a rabbit hole it's a lot of different rabbit holes and it is almost as if it's that invitation to to escape from this is an invitation to get your spiritual and your practical feet on the ground again and say okay how can i get some sanity back here and the more i look at um say the amish who have a very critical intelligent relationship to technology you know which is not just a a blanket rejection but is also not the kind of mindless button pressing acceptance that we have in the west the more i look at that and i think okay well they've they've managed to survive for 400 years yeah something there's something that works there you know whether or not you share their particular christianity or christianity at all you can say there's a community that knows how to how to make itself work so what are they doing that we could emulate even if we're coming from different places and traditions yeah i've told people i've always brought up the old order mennonites and the amish for people who want to look at real functioning communities i would think that you know when you look at all the the communities that came up in the 60s like all of them most of them just failed i don't think if there's any still functional whereas the mennonite communities are have hundreds of years of history and like you said they're approaching technology people think that they just reject technology they don't what they do is they they ask to what extent technology is going to serve or not the community that's all the only thing that's what they ask of the technology so you'll you'll find different communities come to different conclusions some will say oh we'll have one car for the whole community or a few cars for the whole community and people will have to you know share it and so therefore they no one will be tempted to have all these the problem with the car and they're so right because the car makes you have friends all your friends can be an hour living an hour or you know 30 minutes from you and so you don't have community you just have friends that you visit like this and you know i mean that's what that's where we are that's that's life but there's a manner in which that is obviously a problem that we don't we're not friends with people that are friends with each other and that have to deal with the kind of communal not some of us are but a lot of us don't have that especially if we live in suburbs we just have neighbors and then we have our friends that we visit and that's really just the car that did that no no absolutely i mean i kind of cut my teeth as an environmentalist as a as an anti-car activist at anti-wrath actually back in the 90s you know i used to chain myself to bridges and try and stop roads being built there was a big movement of that going on in britain in the 90s and that was one of the critiques actually you know it's like this this these things not only did they trash the countryside and the towns because you have to build motorways everywhere but they're radically isolating you know you get in your car you put your own music on you go where you like and that's kind of you know that's fun it's the kind of liberation myth of the west you know it's like james dean and all the rest of it yeah you call bruce springsteen get in your car drive where you like but you know there's a consequence uh and there's you know it makes makes me think there's a there's a there's a long-standing christian critique of technology that you'll get famously in people like say wendell berry who's been writing about this for 50 years about community and about technology uh ivan ilitch is another one jacqueline yeah jacqueline's books are terrific from a christian perspective his absolute critique of exactly what you're talking about the system of almost the system of the beast but the system of control and how this is all rolled out um and nina these guys were writing half a century ago that wendell berry's been writing since before i was born about this uh and he and he lives it as well so this is almost like the ground has been prepared in a way by a lot of very smart people who could see this coming and it's now here and it's going to accelerate and so the question is yes how do you go and live that and you know the answer is going to be different for everybody but it has to be that question is going to get more urgent every week yeah a funny story if you it's a funny and sad story if you want to know how crazy the world has become i was asked i was asked to talk at the jacqueline society this summer here in mcgill by some of the prominent members of the society and i didn't even know what's going on it caused a massive controversy and then a massive problem in the society and it went up all the way to the president of the society supposedly because i'm uh supposedly i'm a notorious anti-vaxxer and and i thought that's hilarious i mean i don't even care about the vaccine i always i've been saying from the beginning that my issue with this has very little to do with what they're injecting into me it has everything to do with the system of technological control which is which is in which it is wrapped and i thought so the jacqueline society won't let me speak there you know and they're supposed to be christian anarchists it's just hilarious that is quite something i wonder what jacqueline would actually have thought of that i think you've had a lot of things to say about vaccine passports yeah and but it's exactly exactly that point i mean the writing that i did about the vaccine system was was talked about in exactly the same way you know this is anti-vaxx writing which it wasn't i don't care whether anyone's vaccinated you should be vaccinated if you want to be um again it's about the system of control that is connected with it and that is something that plenty of vaccinated people are concerned about right and this is not an issue of good vaxxed or bad unbacks or vice versa but because of this insane tribalism where people are just looking for an enemy and not listening to any of the nuances it's almost as if as you said earlier um people aren't really concentrating on what's going on you know i think because people a lot of people anyway certainly in the in the ones who are really in the political ideological trenches are so obsessed with destroying their enemies whoever they think their enemies are they're not paying attention to the bigger picture which is that whoever you are whatever wing of the spectrum you think you're on you're going to have to do what this thing says you're going to have to conform to this machine and it could take any number of different shapes and if you if you if you think that nice mr trudeau is is using his emergency power as well and that's all right because you're a liberal like him now we'll wait 10 years and see if canada gets a very right-wing government which starts using them against you do you not see that possibility you know of course anything could happen once once the system is closed around you which is one of the points of the jackal all made endlessly you know it doesn't matter who you are you're going to have to be you're going to have to conform to this world as saint paul would put it so how are you going to not conform to the world and that's a it's an interesting spiritual question as well as a practical one you know and i think that's the root of it because as you said before actually that a lot of the sort of id idealistic communes that were set up in the 60s most of them collapsed and jonathan height did some writing about this a few years ago he quoted a study on this and any community intentional community that was set up over the last 50 years or so in the west that survived almost all of them were religious yeah so they you know they may or may not have been christian but people came together with a higher aim and their higher rate was to serve god to do whatever spiritual work they thought they had to do the ones that fell apart were the ones where lots of kind of idealistic individualists came together to change the world and then fought each other and then slept with each other and then the whole that's right five minutes but the ones that survived and still survival today overwhelmingly have a higher aim they have a spiritual aid which is which is a lesson you know because just having a community in sense of being in a place isn't enough unless you think you're doing something that is more significant and important than politics or or anything worldly actually so that's that the thing that interests me now and i don't know the answer to it is uh maybe you can answer it for me what's that what's the i'm hoping so what's you know what's that what's the for a christian particularly what's the spiritual response that we should have to this i mean we've talked about sort of benedict option in a practical sense you know going to a place and and forming a community but you know what was i'm interested in this one and uh it's yeah question how do you live because you know you can you could do what i've done to a degree i live on a small holding out in the country and i have friends around me who are similarly kind of uh alternatively concerned about the the thing the machine and so we try not to participate too much and i don't have a smartphone i don't have a tv so i'm sort of on the edge of it um but you're still in it all the time it's still all around you you can't not engage with it so the question is what's your spiritual work how do you man how does that manifest in your life i suppose yeah i mean i think i definitely think that first of all just being intentional is the first step in j for most people at least understanding that that's going on and now being intentional about your choices and about the things that you attend to you know most of it i think has to do with hierarchy and but it's hard because it's hard because these technological things they they're made to basically devour your attention they're made to take it all up but so i don't obviously i don't think that there's anything wrong and to a certain extent i think christians will always have to somewhat engage with the system because we're not i don't think christians are unless you're really a monastic and you but even even even monasteries are never isolated completely there's always there's always a sense in which we're also meant to radiate in the world in terms of example and in terms of patterns so i think the best thing would be to be deliberate and to be hierarchical in what is your priority and so make sure that you know your family that's the you know your family is a priority your communities are the priority create deliberate relationships with people around you work towards alternative systems but not be i think i think being wise about it you know christ said be you know be innocent as dubs and wise as as serpents and i think this is right now is the time to do that i i made a video about king david and how king david escapes the tyranny of saint paul above saint paul that's hilarious that i said that of king saul because saul becomes paul in his own story so i get saint paul like that's the problem of symbolism is when things connect in your mind too much symbolism exactly that makes you say that king david is escaping saint paul anyways so king david tries to escape the tyranny of king saul and and by doing that he becomes everything of the margin he becomes uh he comes he associates with these debtors and thieves you know he lives in a cave he pretends to fight for the enemy of king saul he he feigns being crazy he does all these things that are completely you know look like he's he's a strange uh shifty character and so i think that we have to start thinking that way we have to to to not be naive about things but understand that we also have to be shifty at this moment and be able to be able to navigate with with some trickery you know the world that is laying itself in front of us yeah yeah it's a trickster moment isn't it that's right and it's um there's an issue of uh just trying to be in the world but not of it which is the thing i keep coming back to all the time it's very interesting i've been reading a lot about the um there's fathers the early ascetics recently um and what's interesting about so many of them so many of the saints who go off to live in the desert including anthony himself um they go off for a period of time but then they're called back again and it's interesting actually they you know that it's seen anthony in saint athanasius his life of saint anthony he talks about anthony spending 20 years you know first in the tombs and then in this ruined fort hiding from everybody and eventually people just break in and force them to come out and he kind of walks out and he says athanasius says he was he'd been initiated by god right so he's been through this enormous training period and then he came out and it was like he was ready to teach now so he had to teach and he had to go and do his work in the world whether or not he wanted to and any other number of saints from saint cusper to saint coleman here in ireland have the same thing they spend their time living in caves or on islands they try to escape they do their work but then when they're ready they're brought back in again so it's almost like there's a balance between the desert and the and this and the town the desert there's the kingdom really you have to get that balance between the world and the kingdom right even if you're certainly not ever going to be a great saint um and so maybe that's i keep looking for the challenge in the moment right the challenge in the time what is it that we're being offered here what's what are we being shown why is this happening what's the what's the what's the challenge for us and maybe that's what it is what's the balance between the world and the kingdom that you have to somehow achieve and as you say it's a dance isn't it it's a kind of daily dance to try and not get consumed literally by the machine but at the same time you know that you can't walk away from it entirely wherever you go you can get a 5g signal in the amazon now you know there's there's no escape from it you can go to the arctic they still you still require a vaccine passport apparently to go to a yes i've heard about that station so there's no escape um so it is that is that balance all the time so how how is this because i mean i've been following really your your sub stack and the articles but i are you working on any fiction right now has that has this been kind of informing your own fiction fiction writing well i'm not i've got a the paperback of my novel alexandria is coming out in uh may in britain um it's already out in the states uh actually that's a novel which is exactly about all of this i i find that i've what i do is i tend to write the same thing in fiction and non-fiction i write i write a novel and then i write the same thing in non-fiction or the other way around for some reason i can't get the things out of my head and so that book is a is an examination it's set a thousand years in the future and it's an examination exactly of of the kind of the battle between the body and the machine which is what this is coming down to this is coming down to a kind of gnostic machine culture in which we upload our minds and live forever supposedly versus a kind of rooted bodily humanity um which is again i think you could probably trace right back to kane you could trace it right back to adam and eve actually you're gonna you're gonna thought is it is it i will be done or is it do what that will you know those are the kind of two streams that i keep seeing so that's that i mean that that's coming out but that's a novel i wrote before covid actually um so i have i'm not writing anything else at the moment apart from these essays because they're all consuming to be honest too too consuming sometimes i'm working my way through what this system is how it came about how it's manifesting today and then the the final part of the series which i'm going to be starting i suppose in a few months is the conversation we've been having now really how do we live through this what what are the kind of practical responses we can have and it's been a really interesting project not just the writing but the the um the conversations with some of the readers you know there's some really smart people and some of them are quite intimidating they're much cleverer than me so which is which is great because they tell me things i should be reading and things i should be seeing and but it's it's that as well as the the state of the world has helped to sharpen kind of how i'm seeing it but it's um yeah but it feels like there's a it feels like there's an interesting watershed moment that happened i guess around the time of the trucker convoy where there are certain things that no one was allowed to say or very few people dared say before and then all of a sudden public figures were starting to talk about things that no no one was allowed to talk about the world economic forum and i imagine when you did in your in your essay people came after you saying conspiracy this conspiracy that but all of a sudden that seems like that watershed is that's that's happened and so now you know you see majin nawaz and joe rogan talk about you find people you know jordan peterson has been talking about it so you see people mentioning it now in a way that is just more realizing wait a minute this is not there's no there's no hidden conspiracy they're just telling you what they're going what they want to do and they're showing how much power they have like there's nothing hidden about it it's just there yeah no it's fascinating that again this is another one of these political kind of weird things has happened when i was an anti-globalization activist 20 years ago you know we were all protesting against the world economic forum and the g8 and and the wto that was what the left did it was what the anarchists did right of course you do because these are the global power structures now apparently mentioning the same thing makes you a right-wing conspiracy this and again you know i read klaus schwab's book on covert 19 which is called covid19 the great reset it's a very boring book it's not all disappointingly dull actually but you know this this is not a conspiracy theory it's very very clear it was on the cover of time magazine it was they had a time magazine saying the great reset on the cover yeah i mean it's like an agenda it's a program these are the most powerful guys in the world they love global capitalism they want to roll it out here's the plan you can like it or lump it to be fair to klaus fab he's very open about it he's got a website you know this is not doing stuff under a volcano this is very clear these are the powers of the world um the people used to know that you know the left used to know that the activists used to know i don't know why it's been left to the likes of joe rogan to have to talk about it when all of the people who used to be anti-capitalistic suddenly decided it's fine it's a mystery but yeah it's it's very very open and as you say people are now just talking about it because you can't not talk about it it's very clear what's going on uh and one of the things that it's just like it's just like it's like the tip of an iceberg that you know klaus fab is just a sort of useful whipping boy for for because he's he's kind of naive enough to put his ideas on paper and put them out there so so everyone goes for him as if he was a kind of ringleader but he's just a manifestation of of of the system that that exists and he thinks it's a good thing you know he thinks it'll be great once the world is managed in this way and this is what's gonna save the planet and um seems to me there ought to be discussion about that without the conversation being removed from the internet and but i the it's very it's not that to see what happened is not that difficult in the sense that someone somewhere realized or maybe it just organically appeared that if you made a gesture towards that part of the system we talked about which is you can be whatever you want you can self-identify you can you know that that all identities have you know all these marginal identities have value if you can gesture to that then people will give you all the control you need on this side and so it's a it's like a it's a weird game so just so justin trudeau says you know like we we we are our only value is inclusion right that's what he said he said our only value is our only as canadians our only value is inclusion and so it's like if he does that then you can close down people's bank accounts yeah well it's interesting i mean i think that the way the way i'm understanding it is that as you say that there's a kind of ideology of borderlessness that really is about that it appeals to a lot of people on the left because they they think borders are oppressive which sometimes they can be it appeals to capitalists because borders get in the way of the free flow of movement and labor it appeals to klaus schwab who's a kind of globalized ideologue who wants a one world system so as you say you can get a lot of people on board by gesturing towards uh the notion that all borders and boundaries are bad things so there are no borders there are no boundaries there are no limits and once you start to say there are no limits then you're back into the technological system again because the technological system fundamentally says we are going to use technology to liberate you from nature including your human nature and that's why you know the guys in silicon valley are very very open about their project that we're all going to end up living forever this is how it's going to be well the oligarchs are on you i don't know if the rest of us will be able to afford it but most people yes they certainly will be um and that again is this kind of gnostic project of borderlessness no borders no boundaries no limits uh no natural limits no political limits no cultural limits all limits are bad all borders about all boundaries about and that's a project that a certain type of leftist and a certain type of capitalist and a certain type of political ideologue of different stripes actually can get on board with because it's about busting through boundaries it's about saying yeah we can define anything in any way we can we can find our gender any way we want our society we can define nature any way we want we can define redefine death or abolish it um all that's left is the kind of the will it's the will to power any anything that you could imagine you could do and so it start you start to see this this this system being created which simultaneously tells us there are no limits to anything and at the same time controls us in a way that we've never been controlled before and it's a it's a sinister combination yeah and liturgically you could say in terms of actual religious manifestation embodiment what we can we saw during covet is the final result of that which is the isolation of individuals the absolute isolation of individuals from each other and the you know the masking and the cutting off the social distancing you know it ended up being in narratively it ended up showing us what that world looks like how this world of of like infinite will to power in the metaverse is basically a world of complete self-isolation from others related individuals and they're sitting there there's a terrific famous photograph i'm sure you've seen it one of mark zuckerberg's events when he's running the setting up his there's this room full of all these kind of guys with their headsets on and zuckerberg's just walking down next to them looking very smug and you think there's the future everyone is utterly isolated here utterly isolated but theoretically all in the same place which isn't real but they think it's real or they they pretend that they do and there's kind of zuckerberg the oligarch looking very happy about this and it is a recreation of the world in which you're utterly isolated staring into something that's fake but you have an illusion of togetherness which has replaced the real togetherness and the new illusion of togetherness is profitable absolutely every aspect of it can be milked for cash everything can be milked for money everything is tracked everything is monitored unlike a real community which is not profitable at all except on a cultural and spiritual level if you're living in a real family in a real community in a real place not very much can be monetized you know not very much can be turned into a consumer good and sold back to you because you're just you those are not your values so we take everything human we destroy it we monetize it and then we sell it back to people as a kind of fake digital community and if they don't like it they can have their bank accounts taken away there's your system there's your system of control and it's uh it's the disturbing thing about it and you know you can look at zuckerberg's film of the metaverse for a good example is how many people seem to think this is just going to be great you know there are a lot of people who are really up for it and it's not in some ways it doesn't have to be imposed it has to be imposed on those at the margins who object to it yeah but for a lot of people it can just be sold to them and they they seem to like it and that's that's the most disturbing thing to me something happened too in terms of narrative you can see it in the shift between the matrix and ready player one like the the aesthetics of the matrix as the system that has to be resisted at the system that has to be escaped got replaced by ready player one which is who controls the system that's all that matters that is it's not that you can try to limit its power no it's all-encompassing it takes up all of your attention and it it is the most powerful controlling thing it's just the question is who is going to control it and the last matrix movie which was horrible by the way but i watched anyways because i wanted because i had this anyway you watch these things so that we don't have to we're pretty yeah because i had an intuition that the new matrix movie would be something like pro matrix like it's pro matrix but pretends to be rebellious nonetheless and it it was kind of like that i'll spoil it for everybody it doesn't matter it ends with like it ends with neo and trinity trinity taking over from neo and becoming like the the man in the relationship you could say and then both of them becoming heads of the matrix basically saying they're going to steer the matrix in the direction that they want and i was like wow that's that's fascinating isn't it i've you know i was thinking to myself i'd lead today that if they made a version of the matrix now it would agent smith would be the good guy you know he'd be misunderstood and yeah now that's very interesting because you know the other thing i think about endlessly is is the ring of power you know tolkien again he keeps coming up and to to try and control the matrix for good is the equivalent of taking the ring to use it exactly isn't it you know it's like and what's so interesting about that is that of course the wise people the the people like gandalf they know you can't even touch the ring right it's it's the the foolish and the ambitious ones who think you can take it's the humans and the twisted wizards and you have to use the hobbit because the hobbit the hobbit is so kind of naive and innocent that he just you know it's possible for him to touch this thing but no we're in the world in which we all think that we can take the ring and use it for our own good or we can control the matrix you're right and that's that's been the shift for the last 20 years and that actually has been the shift perhaps on the left as well it's certainly been the shift in the green movement that i used to kind of run with you know the green movement 40 years ago was being directed intellectually by people like ivan ilitch and jackie law and wendell berry you know it was a movement of people who said look we've got to get out of this machine and we've got to rebuild community and have a relationship with nature because that's how you protect nature it's by living with it right and and caring for it uh it was human it was about the human scale and that was always what the old greens were about and the new greens are about as many wind farms as possible as many solar power stations as possible as much technological control as possible as long as you use it to create a quote sustainable system so it's exactly the same narrative take the ring use it for good control the matrix don't worry it'll be fine this time the good guys are running the huge control system so that's all right and it's it's it is like an endlessly repeating system it's a tower of babel story again isn't it that we talked about last time you stuck don't worry we'll just we'll all get together and build this thing and it'll be fine it'll be totally yeah it'll be totally fine but i mean we know the story we know that this we know even by the very nature of these systems that they are increasingly fragile there is no way around it that's what they are because they also because even the notion of the metaverse is if you you can understand how fragile they are because the identity of your your let's say your supposedly self-willed identity in the metaverse is nonetheless extremely contrived within the parameters of the metaverse your people i mean i guess people your embodied existence is so um it has all this breathing space you know in its in its experience you have i mean and you exp i i'm telling you that because in your books that that's what you also are constantly bringing up is that these experiences that almost even normal day experience like drinking water or putting on a shirt like these experiences have an infinite complexity in them they have a kind of infinite richness which gets completely stunted in the digital world by the very fact that the parameters are limited in the program and so there's a sense in which that's an image of how these systems cannot because a human person cannot be fully contained you just can't you cannot contain an identity completely it's it's impossible by definition and so trying to do that will ultimately lead to fragility and and uh a shattering at some point you cannot it's not possible no will and that's the hope actually you know god god is not mocked that's that's the hope you can't you can't contain a human you can't contain nature you can't recreate it however clever you think you are and everything is it's all built on sand i mean you can you know these things all rely on the power grid to operate right they all rely on fossil fuels they'll rely on the enormously complex grid of civilization which is destroying the natural world and undermining its own kind of cohesiveness at a human level as well so it isn't firstly it can't be contained you actually just literally cannot reproduce nature as much as as much as you think you can and secondly it's you know it's it's coming apart already economically ecologically culturally it's it's undermining itself by attempting to do it which is why interestingly um i think if you if you compare our moment to say say the 60s moment right so the 60s you've got this huge counterculture and if you look at the sort of the the cultural stories of coming out of the 60s it's all about optimism right we can it's the age of aquarius everything's gonna be great we're gonna smash the shackles we're gonna get rid of the limits we're gonna we're gonna it's gonna be free love and etc etc didn't really work out um but the the stories now that are coming out even from the the supposedly counter cultural movements are all stories of let's see if we can get the hell out of this collapsing system so you know what does jeff what does jeff bezos see and and these guys offer us elon musk they offer us a life on another planet because we basically ruined this one you know don't worry we can build bubbles on mars we'll live in them or go off and live in space or you can live in the metaverse we'll create another world rather than trying to live in this one and that's what it comes down to with all these guys the new ideology you know it's gone from this is the age of aquarius we can create a utopia here you know to okay that was a disaster never mind we'll literally build another world and live in that one you know we'll either live on the moon under domes or we will live in the metaverse it's almost like we've given up on nature we've given up on human nature we've given up on culture we've given up on everything human and real and we're going to allow the likes of mark zuckerberg or ellen musk to build us a new yeah a new kingdom it's a it's a twisted religious story of transcendence basically and there's something i think there's something also about how let's say the physical world or the embodied existence it creates it sets up a certain amount of limits that frames your experience in a way that is just it's unacceptable to a lot of these of the ideologues and that's i think part of the problem right because it's not true that i mean you can pretend we're seeing the problems with that you can pretend that you can self identify as anything you can do that it's but it's gonna look very odd it doesn't look odd in the metaverse because you can just basically change your avatar into whatever you want it to be and so in the metaverse you actually can just be whatever you want and nobody will know that you're something else but in but there's a disjunct in reality which is that this world imposes limits they're like they impose kind of these sacred limits to to the possibilities of different identities and how they interact with each other and i think that that's even in the technological problem uh project itself and this kind of fetishization of technology and pushing the limits further there's something in which th the notion that the you know it's like you you want to put pork genes in tomatoes and it's not even that it's just you really just want to do it to show that you can break down the natural you know identities and the natural things that exist in the world it's like it's almost like it is like a will to power but in the in the physical world it it always will be limited it'll it'll always be contrived and so metaverse is the per great salute it's the only solution in the end to their ideology it's playing god i mean quite literally and i i always come back to the the the eating of the apple it's you know what's what's the offer here what's the offer well you can either live according to the will of god according to the dao according to the way of things and you can achieve a theosis in the end you know you can be raised up or you can say well you know what i think i'll walk away from that i'll individuate and i'll be god myself i'm going to choose power over over communion effectively and that's the oldest story and i always talk about this thing i call the machine as a effectively it's a machine for destroying limits that's fundamentally what it does and it is it is the thing that unites all these supposedly disparate strands of politics and economics at the moment which is that none of these people believe in limits and they don't think there should be any limits and any thought of being limit limited is an outrage increasingly you know it's it's crazy it's dangerous it's it's you know whether it's limits around your nation or whether it's limits to you or the the length of time you can live or as you say limits to what you can identify yourself as limits to what your culture can be limits to the the amount you can exploit nature all of this is you know those limits should just not be there we don't we don't think that's fair it's a it's almost an injustice to be limited it might be that this is kind of the final phase of liberalism and liberalism being a project that tells us that that we can we can break through limits you know many of you know and part of that has been beneficial for us um but it's almost kind of metastasized into a project that doesn't understand where true limits are because the it seems to me that in a sane society you've got a balance between limits and you know the need for limits and the need for freedom and as you've said before you know the balance between the margin and the center and the balance has to be there you can't have a society that's too centralized and controlling you can't have a society that has no limits on anything otherwise you haven't got a society right so you've got to achieve that uneasy balance and we've gone to the point in all sorts of ways now where the the aim of almost everything at the head of our culture is the destruction of all limits and all stories and all boundaries and all borders and anything that gets in the way of whatever we think is going to somehow make us fulfilled well we don't even know what that is right we don't know what the aim is it is almost like a it is like a broken technological version of a of a religious story you know you just use your own technological power to effectively get to heaven and live forever rather than doing anything that requires you to question anything or break it down again yeah and the deal ends up being that ultimately we end up serving the machine that's the that's the secret deal it's that's the the secret that the genie isn't telling you is that ultimately it really is like a bad horror story or some old legend about you know something some witch offering you like a cookie offering you something that will give you some power but then ultimately you become a slave of to become a slave and i think that that's what's going to be a battery in the matrix don't you i mean that's why that original story was so good it's like hey you know what you are you're just a battery you know and you think you think you can live forever you know you're actually in a pod halfway up a tower being being siphoned for your electric current it's a horrible image and it's it's such a resonant one because it's kind of true that's that those original films worked because they channeled something that probably the filmmakers didn't even know they were doing i think that's what i spent i think they the they made that movie and then spend the rest of their lives trying to kind of undo or deconstruct their own movie i think they did because they'd shown that was such a powerful set of images disguised as a kind of kick-ass kung fu movie you know it was basically like here is modern life this is what it is and everybody kind of knew it so when you saw the images presented like that you just thought oh my god and it's yeah as you say they can't they can't undo it once they've done it and there's a way in which that you know mcluhan talked about how we we're becoming this the the reproductive organs of the machine like that basically the machine needs us in order to reproduce but one that what i've realized is that with opposite from what we see in the matrix we're actually being farmed for intelligence is what we're being farmed for so it's taking the highest aspect of humanity and then somehow making it into a resource and so we're we're there to give intelligence to this thing we're there to make google intelligent because machines don't have intelligence on their own they need to farm it out to humans gather it up into algorithms and then then use it to turn it back on us but ultimately we're we're providing intelligence to and we're doing it by attention it's really religious it's like you do you want to know how a god was born in the old world right it's like you through our attention and are giving our intelligence to this thing then it is becoming more and more alive and more and more salient and coming back down on us and imposing itself through through its paren different parameters through its rules through its framing of our reality so it's a it's a very very disturbing trade that we're participating in yeah it's like creating an aggregator isn't it um there's a the disturbing thing about it is that in silicon valley there's a lot of guys who are very conscious of this and this is their religious worldview um i i talk often about this book called what technology wants by kevin kelly i don't know if you've read it but it's a really good book if you want to know how these guys are thinking you should read that book it's a few years old and i wrote an essay about it a while back kevin kelly is one of the i don't know i don't think he worked for google but he was certainly right in there with with the silicon valley lads um and kelly's kelly's book precisely says this he says look this system that we're creating which he calls the technium not the machine but it's the same thing he says he says it's using us to create itself so it's a really interesting book because it's almost a it's a it's a very sharp critique of the machine that you might expect to say get from someone like illog except that kelly thinks it's good right so he finally fundamentally is saying you know because you get a lot of critics of technology and then the counter critics will come along and they'll say oh no no technology is neutral it's just what you do with it that counts you know you can use it for good or use it for bad and kelly says no that's rubbish technology is not neutral it has an agenda it's going in a certain direction and it's using us to create itself and this is going to be terrific because what we're basically doing is building our evolutionary replacement okay and this is what these guys are really up to and they they're very open about it again it's like klaus fab though they're not they're not hiding anything right they genuinely believe in a very mystical sense in a very religious sense that they are creating a new world with a new consciousness in it and maybe they are and they're trying to manifest a new consciousness through this stuff so as you say google is not just a thing that helps you to find stuff that you're interested in it's a it's a collection mechanism that's been created very deliberately to do that and again that was very open uh yeah but it's not going to be an old it's not going to be a new consciousness it's going to be a very very old consciousness like a like a bad sound like a bad like a bad uh you know fantasy narrative where you know an old god is buried in the ground and then you finally unearth it and it comes back we'll be staring we'll be staring down the down azazel in no time no actually funnily enough that was sort of sort of the plot of my novel or at least the conceit of it as well is that you know what you think you're raising is not what you're raising but you are raising something and so on one side you've got critics of technology like ll or wendell berry who can see what's coming on the other side you've got kevin kelly's in the mark zuckerberg they can see what's coming too but they think it's great and they're trying to create it and then in the middle and lots of other people who are just going oh you know it's fine it'll be right or i don't really like it but i don't know what to do that's most of us we're stuck there whereas on these guys are deliberately creating a very particular world and it's manifesting very fast i mean it's if you if you're not disturbed by the armed robot dogs which are already in operation then i don't know what to say to you you know where do you think this is going where do you think it's going um it's yeah that's that's what's coming very fast now it might even be if you want to talk about it kind of mystically or spiritually that that we can somehow sense this thing being born around us and that's part of the confusion of the moment yeah something else is in control at this point and it isn't really us anymore these systems have outrun us you know the the machine is much bigger than us and to some degree it's starting to not need us as much as we thought it did yeah but there's a manner in which that is technically easy to see because as the system rolls out and as it becomes more and more apparent what direction is going in order to maintain relevant you have to compete in order to be of those that help the system attain its gold faster or else you're going to lose power in the system so all the governments are all competing about who gets that digital id first who gets to digital currency first all of this they realize will will if you fall behind at this point then you're going to be left back in this in this thrust so it the system itself seems to be like you said kind of creating itself through our desire to participate in it and our desire to not be on the margins of it and so it's it's you know you could it's it's almost it really is all like elon musk is an easy vision of that where he he consciously said it he kept warning warning warning and then realized well okay well i guess these warnings aren't being heard so i need to now not get left back and i'm going to create a neural chip in your brain that's going to that's going to connect you directly to the matrix yeah yeah i know that's i've never quite been able to work him out actually i don't know what's going on with elon musk he's a very strange character you never know quite quite what side is under you but yeah in terms of what he's doing it's it's very clear which direction it's going in um i mean he's his has a very disturbing humor about it you know starlink is very close to skynet i mean it's basically taking the same words and just changing them a little like what's the difference it's like the guys who thought presumably either they thought it would be funny or they have no idea what's going on and they decided that it would be a good idea to put your scannable vaccine passport chip in your right hand you know to literally put it under the skin in your right hand which is already happening in parts of the world it's like okay hang on we have a mark in our right hand through which you need to buy and sell is this an elaborate joke or is this something very much worse what's happening here you know which came first the prophecy or the guys who thought it would be funny to joke about the prophecy yeah does it matter no yeah yeah it doesn't matter it seems but it does seem like christianity like this is part of the story like this is all supposed to happen somehow like we we don't we're not supposed to participate in the scandal but the scandal will happen this is going to manifest and you know we need to be attentive as it's as it's happening and not be naive about what its implications are especially for me when they here in canada it was so when they imposed the covet passport for church is when then i started screaming at the top of my lungs like okay now like there's no that you know i cannot i cannot be silent about this anymore this is now really reaching in the level that is that is apocalyptic so we have to we we have to not be complicit as much as we can in this so yeah yeah well that was that was the same for me as it was the vaccine passport system you know up until that point i've been thinking okay well uh maybe this all makes sense i i don't know who who am i i'm not a virologist yeah i'm doing what i'm told but it was very clear that what was happening with the passport system was nothing to do with the science behind the vaccines had nothing to do with science behind the virus and it was very much about coercion and the fact that as i say everything kind of clicked into place you had the state you had the corporations you had the media and they were all they were all going down the same track without any dissent and it was extremely disturbing and you didn't have to know exactly what was going on to scream at the top of your voice and say this is wrong but then of course as soon as you did you were called a crazy conspiracy theorist who thought the lizards were running everything but it's um again it's that sense of you you just know you just know there is something very bad happening here where this kind of stuff is just being rolled out and we're okay with it and it continues to be rolled out as you say the digital currencies are coming the global digital ids are coming the ability to shut people's bank accounts down is already here but it will get much easier when that stuff happens and yeah at this point if you haven't seen what's unrolling you need to wake up very quickly and then work out what you're going to do about it because it's not going to be as it's supposed to be a system of total control i don't think it will be because i don't think it will work and i don't think it can last it's too ambitious it's not going to be able to be rolled out around the world but it's going to be rolled out far enough that it could do um it's going to do tyrannical things and and the disturbing the really frightening possibility is that some of the things they're trying to create in silicon valley will work you know some of these artificial intelligences will come about the giant system which barely needs any human interaction at all we'll be able to will be able to work and that's that's the name of the game that's very that's very much on the table so yeah you need to think hard about whether your option is benedict or anthony or or anything else you know i don't know but yeah that's that's where we are i think yeah i'm going for the king david ronan option right now yeah yeah we need you need a list of different options that people can contribute to you know i think it's that's the way forward yeah but there's an interesting like i've been playing with the image of the ronin like there's this interesting story in japan that called the 47 ronin about a master that was wrongfully uh let's say lost his honor wrongfully and the all these ronins spend 50 years or like i don't know years and years preparing for their revenge but in doing so some of them have to fall into all these states that look completely disloot you know they they someone becomes like you know not sure if he's really a drunk or he's pretending to be drunk but like there's this fall into these states of hiding and of uh and of trickery let's say so i think that at some point that's the this is the situation we have to be wise we have to be wise like serpents so yeah and i think we can't afford to be respectable either you know i mean that's the other thing i always come back to this i mean christ was not respectable none of his disciples were respectable saint anthony was not respectable saint francis was not respectable um you you know you are you if you can't you can't be conformed to the world because this is where the world is going consciously or unconsciously so you have to be prepared to be well all the things that christ told you you were going to be right rejected and humiliated and attacked and all the rest of it not for the sake of it just because you're being a contrarian but you know you have to that's the really hard but you know you have to say if i'm going to walk in the direction i need to walk in i'm going to be metaphorically wearing rags or maybe actually wearing rags so there's a lot of renunciation i think that has to come somehow again that'll be different for different people but maybe that's the hardest bit for those of us who probably come from sort of comfortable countries you know there's a renunciation involved whether it's reputational or physical or material or whatever it is you know there's um and that's what the interesting people always do you know the marginal people who can bring the wisdom back into the center you know the fools for christ this is what we're we're not we're all going to be called to doing the same thing but there's something that nags away at me about the need to to renounce and to walk away in some way before you can see what the kind of the next stage of the path is so that's a really interesting question to kind of prey on actually to think you know what's the what's the renunciation here where do i walk which way do i go so listen i think this is a good place to to to end thanks for thanks for that bit of wisdom and uh everybody you need to subscribe to paul's uh sub stack because it's it's just great it's a it's a wonderful place to meditate and to think about what's going on in a way that is is insightful but also um let's say not not political like not not political in the basis sense right not not uh not one-sided but really thoughtful so thanks for all the work you're doing and uh you know i'm really looking forward paul and i are collaborating together on the on a project called the saint basil's i forget saint basil school of of of of writing yeah and uh and so i'm looking forward to doing that as well where one of the solutions to this problem is also to help people understand true beauty and uh tell better stories make better images you know and be able to participate in in the world through beauty because that it's not a small thing it actually creates patterns for imitation for other people it sends out ripples into the world when you participate in beauty so so everybody look forward for that as well so paul thanks for your time right thank you joseph as you know the symbolic world is not just a bunch of videos on youtube we are also a podcast which you can find on your uh usual podcast platform but we also have a website with a blog and several very interesting articles by very intelligent people that have been thinking about symbolism on all kinds of subjects we also have a clips channel a facebook group you know there's a whole lot of ways that you can get more involved in the exploration and the discussion of symbolism don't forget that my brother matsuya wrote a book called the language of creation which is a very powerful synthesis of a lot of the ideas that explore and so please go ahead and explore this world you can also participate by you know buying things that i've designed t-shirts with different designs on them and you can also support this podcast and these videos through paypal or through patreon everybody who supports me has access to an extra video a month and there are also all kinds of other goodies and tiers that you can get involved with so everybody thank you again and thank you for your support
