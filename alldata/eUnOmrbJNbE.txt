ladies and gentlemen welcome back to the Champions chess tour finale of 2023 this is an eight-player knockout style event with a $500,000 priz fund we've got Magnus Carlson we have Hikaru Nakamura we have some of the world's best players we have a future star competing as well Dennis lazovic of course and this is round number five and six this is the third recap of the event I'm currently in Toronto I do apologize for the interrogation lighting the poor webcam but that's the travel setup my friends we are witnessing something absolutely insane happening right before our eyes couple of crazy things happened in today's uh in today's round robin portion of the event I'm going to share some of these unbelievable moments with you and then I'm going to give you a standings update it's over that's all I'll say for now with a question mark Or maybe an exclamation point my friends it's round number five and we get a marquee matchup right away it's Wesley so and it's Magnus Carlson and you will notice from the time on the clock already it is Armageddon they drew their two games these guys are winning the event this is round five and they're both 4 and0 so Wesley and Magnus have won every single head-to-head matchup and they just so happened to be playing in the fifth round of the event which is super fun and they drew their first two games Magnus wagered eight minutes he I think he wagered 853 so Magnus gets the black pieces and remember the Armageddon Works in a way where if black makes a draw then black wins but to do that black Wagers a lot less time watch this game obviously you will because you're already here so Magnus plays a Sicilian Defense and Wesley plays a sideline Wesley stalls a center pawn move by developing both of his Knights and uh Magnus doesn't want to give Wesley any more time to sort of conjure something up so he closes down the position like this giving up of course some light squared Equity but it's okay because he's going to develop the rest of his piece okay stops you know he stops Wesley from playing that G5 making Wesley spend a little bit of time D6 and then Wesley plays whatever the hell that move is the idea I believe is either to go to F1 or to G4 ultimately to E3 and then to control that scare in the center with D5 this is what happens right when um you're playing in a setting where you have basically six minutes less than the opponent but a draw counts as a win goofy things are going to happen castles Knight F6 F4 e takes F4 Bishop takes F4 and clearly Wesley has built up some good stuff over here right it it it it's just looking like Wesley has some semblance of some really nothing there right I mean you're not going to just attack Magnus so easily so Magnus plays okay excuse me Wesley brings the Knight right and now Bishop to E6 and Magnus is just trying to trade a couple of pieces in a perfect world Magnus will get some sort of position that looks like this active rook and everything and you know he's going to be quite happy um but instead of that in this position Wesley so plays the absolutely gangster move Knight to G5 check which according to the game review is given a fat question mark it is given a fat question mark because the computer does not even realize on the depth that it is standing that after Pawn takes Bishop takes this pin is surprisingly annoying and white is going to build up some form of attack and that is what Wesley does he transfers his Queen over he stays patient Magnus plays Knight D7 a good move securing his Knight but now Wesley plays the clearance sacrifice E5 looking to get the Knight to E4 and he does and then he gets his Queen to the H4 square and all of a sudden Magnus is under severe pressure Magnus now needs to strike back with F5 apparently but he doesn't he doesn't play that move doesn't play F5 doesn't play the computer Top Choice and so after F5 after F5 according to the computer he he might have been in the balance but he takes the bishop now that move is given a bit of a question mark because now boom and Wesley is opening up the position here against the king while also being able to take back the material Wesley invested material for a big attack now he's going to get the big attack and the material back Bishop D5 Wesley plays Knight F6 Knight takes F6 and now in this position Wesley saw a man after my own heart I shook his hand downstairs very pleasant as always we interviewed him in the postgame panel instead of taking with the bishop which would be a huge mistake because white should not be trading the piece as Wesley so sacrifices The Rook Rook takes F6 the idea of Rook takes F6 is so Savage the idea of Rook takes F6 is that after Bishop takes F6 you don't take back but you play double check King G6 Queen H6 King F5 Rook to F1 King to E6 Rook F6 King D7 Rook takes Pawn takes and you emerge with a powerful attack not a completely winning position but a powerful attack but Magnus was disturbed by that development Magnus was disturbed by the fact that Bishop takes F6 probably doesn't work so he can't do it and instead he sacrificed the queen and it's much easier to sit here with stockfish pointing out these symbols but apparently he actually could have taken walked his King to D7 and prayed but instead the prayers of Wesley so were answered because now he's up a queen and not only is he up a queen he is brutally prying the king's defenses apart he plays King F2 a beautiful move looking to get his Rook here looking to get his King to to hunt Black's King out into the open and that is exactly what he did that is exactly what he did and ladies and gentlemen it took just over 40 moves but Wesley so completely and totally excuse me now well it was over in in like 30-ish moves uh completely and totally dominantly and convincingly took down Magnus Carlson Magnus played Rook C2 and simply resigned because Queen F6 Queen F6 is coming he's going to lose the pawn on G5 and the pawns are going to promote Wesley so just beat Magnus it is over he Wesley so is 5-0 damn it what is going on this man is 5-0 and he just played an unbelievable game he played Knight to G5 check I am offended that this boo low depth game review thinks that this is a mistake for all in sense and purposes a direct assault on Magnus Carlson's King a KN for one Pawn sometimes we see two one crazy Wesley wins now that was just the beginning of an absolutely absurd day of Chess Fabiano Carana versus Dennis lavic we know lvic is solid he's drawing a lot of these guys Fabby goes for a nice and solid Italian remember this round number five every match counts for Fabiano because he is still looking to qualify Dennis trying to play a bit aggressively but fa do doing a nice job there creating a barrier around his King and I think the experience here in the E4 E5 positions is going to be huge look at look at Fabby avoiding the trade of Queens we have all these little symbols here that you know that that the engine's going to throw out and it's is a very very patient game a lot of maneuvering in this one which is why I'm sort of clicking through it because I'd rather focus on some of the more open kind of exciting games of action the position got locked Fabiano started expanding finally using a little bit of that queenside space advantage and lavic trying to come out with C5 but he he just waited a little bit too long and by the time he opened up the position Fabby immediately starts punishing him building up the pressure on that oh look at that diagonal seizing Rook C1 and uh even though he's trading pieces he is still completely winning because black just can't defend himself Fabiano slowly steadily wins that pawn on H6 beautiful combination Fabiano used the I was going to say combination of play of the queen side and the King side with a center locked like that disallowing black from Easy piece communication it was just a slow and steady game it was youth versus experience it was a man that has played for the world championship who has played many many many for many titles and uh he goes to an endgame and I mean just just a Flawless patient game from Fabiano to take down the youngster he wins a very important match for his overall standings in this event in the first round of the day it was the Battle of the French Dudes uh well one is French and uh one is recently French uh and that is Ali Resa versus mvl French number one number two and and and what more iconic opening to play between two Frenchmen than a French Gotham you're so clever that's my really borderline offensive French accent I I met mxim by the way uh super super nice guy uh and he explained to me uh something about an endgame from from a different position which I will not spoil to you right now uh it's a very sharp game looks like black is about to lose some material here but this is all Theory as you can see from the gentleman spending their time black grabs a knight white grabs a bishop Queen A5 and we go for this endgame and why is better here uh White is better here because he has the two Bishops that's the first thing that we look at we look at the bishop pair but also look at Black's pieces like how are these pieces going to get out if you told black he could not touch his F or B pawns he would resign he would literally resign the game right now uh because he needs to use those pawns to try to fight back against White's bind but the good thing about Maxim's position he doesn't really care like traditional know wisdom would tell you that these doubled pawns like might not be good or something like that yeah but he's he's going to just patiently wait B his time maybe he's going to put pressure on this side maybe he's going to take and put the Knight there and grab a pawn at some point White's not just going to have a symbolic positional Advantage he's going to have a tangible advantage of one or two pawns right he's just going to be very slow computer doesn't like this move but the advantage drops by like you know one white is still convincingly better slow and patient game and and Ali Resa just runs out of things to do I mean the computer is trying to tell Ali Resa to play moves like this or G6 and basically sit and wait instead he tries to make something happen he's like all right I'm going to unclog my pores a little bit you've seen those videos the pimple popping oh first of all it's disgusting but it's very satisfying ala decides you know what I need to pop this pimple let me open up the position a little bit but Maxim just like Ali rzo playing so and look at the time seven minutes up for Maxim in this format it's just not good enough and uh he improves his position on all three sides of the board actually it's Al resak who's trying to make something happen and does uh and Maxim loses a little bit of control here as you can see but watch the clock that's the most important thing I mean Maxim basically had a a he was calling the shots from start to finish and Alias is now down below a minute and it's it's just going to be too hard to defend the position Al Resa did a nice job fighting back uh Maxim might have had a better way to capitalize on the advantage uh you know transforming it from symbolic to actually to actionable but um what's going to happen is something that is going to make fans of Ali Resa fuja a little bit bummed out as Maxim just stockpiles the pressure and ultimately it gets Al Resa 15 seconds on the clock just not going to cut it already the advantage has been rebuild because of the weakness the split pawns the F5 the pin right the pieces being overloaded here all defending each other and and he just beautiful move Rook E6 that beautiful brilliant symbol Rook E6 there is Rook C6 and if you take this way it's the discovered check and I'm going to pick up a couple of Pawns and that's what happens and Maxim throws in a a check for good measure to force the king and takes that pawn cuz the a Pawn's not going anywhere he will come back for it at some moment just a matter of time the worst part here is two pass pawns walking directly to the king and the Bishop from a distance is a sniper and it it uh it was a long game but it was a very convincing one for maxim I mean he did lose his Advantage if you stare at stockfish the whole time but the bishop versus knight was proven and um he does take down his countryman a very rough tournament for Ali RZA fua who just simply cannot win a match I mean he almost started the Tournament 2 and0 and at the beginning of the event I did say in a video that I did for chess.com for predictions I said Ali R is the biggest wild card in the event like like I mean he could show up and completely dominate I was very happy actually Magnus did an interview where he echoed what I said uh he said Ali res is a huge wild card and he thinks his ceiling is ridiculously high but he's just not hitting it um he he wasn't like echoing what I said but he said something very similar and now another massive matchup this is the matchup between hikaro Nakamura and Nock Abdu satoro hikaro has to win he is in the bottom of the standings he is nearly falling out of the event um and we have to I mean hekaro just got to do something he's had a very shaky event uh a goofy line here as hikaro plays a kashik of Sicilian which by the way is just the best name for an opening like period this really weird setup chosen from nck who then proceeds to get a losing position in eight moves he's losing on the eighth move of the of the opening he should have played Bishop E2 if he was going to develop his Bishop but all of a sudden like for example if White Castles here to try to defend this uh Queen H4 is game over like you just straight up lose the game because if you play h three I take and then I take the night noer is literally losing in eight moves which takes a lot of effort when the average rating of the two opponents is 2729 Fay um so he just has to lose a pawn straight up just losing a pawn now here apparently hikaro has to go Queen B6 anchor the Knight pressure the queen side he doesn't he backs up which is again like something's off something's off about Hikaru he's like he's just not he's not feeling it you know like you ever go to a hikaro stream and he's mad at himself for like playing a little too slowly he's just he's not feeling it like the mov just they're not you know Queen B6 of course just Queen B6 but something's not there and before you know it just watch the evaluation like norre got a lost position it's equal it like the position is equal despite norre being a pawn down how is that possible well it's possible because this wall is going to go this way hi Caro's got a castle he's got no choice he can't put his King in the center I got a bazooka staring at that pawn can't put the king there can't Castle the other way because you got no Rook you know new new slash can't castle if it's a ghost Rook so Hikaru does his best and he does end up castling but but nb's just attacking him and the game completely spins out of control they both have about two they both have one minute they have two minutes there they have one minute there Hikaru sacks his Rook which is not designed necessarily to Checkmate white as much as it is to open up his King for long-term play but then he makes a slight inaccuracy again I'm not nitpicking like I'm not sitting here going well it says it's a question mark it's just like the flow right the flow is not necessarily there and now total pandemonium both guys less than a minute scrambling if Karu gets to an end game he probably wins because of White's ruined structure so he's going to grab as many pawns as possible apparently he's losing like apparently if white plays Rook F1 and then tries to like go for some attack he's winning but it's chaos they both have less than 30 seconds wh's King is wide open no you're back oh my goodness and E2 ends the game because you threaten this and you threaten to promote out of nowhere Hikaru emerges as the winner that is a massive win for him that is a huge win he needs this win but I have horrible news for Hikaru fans because he lost the next game Hikaru won with black which is a godsend I mean it's like slightly overblown but winning with black is incredible because when you play White you just do your thing I mean you just play solidly he's got a and Hikaru was winning the next game and then he lost so they go to an Armageddon and Hikaru bids a believe below 9 minutes if not below 9 minutes I think he bid 9:30 we we'll see it in a second and he was he was very unhappy I mean like he they're making the players do interviews to discuss their Armageddon mids and um yeah Hikaru bid 905 so Hikaru loses with white after winning with black uh and now he has to hold the arm again right okay that was nuts that first game was nuts we have another Kalashnikov uh we have a same line as last time this time in a shocking turn of events 2300 uh not 20 23 2700 rated uh no abov does not lose the game uh the same way as previous because now there is obviously a slight difference here um if black plays Knight G4 in this position then there's Queen takes G4 so the difference is that last time there was a Pawn on D6 which is a slight you know subtle change this time D5 and Knight B4 Karo sacrifices a pawn but he wins it back and again second time in a row no problems in the opening whatsoever look at the time look at the time 2 minutes 2 minute different difference started at six so NRE spends a huge amount of time and it's just like all right I got to I just got to play chess like I I I just got to play chess right look at nre's down on time I mean hik Caro's openings have been solid he has really caught a lot of guys off guard and he I mean just he just can't lose this position right okay rook and Bishop rook and Bishop Five Pawns rook and Knight Five Pawns Rook d8 we going to go to a rook end game no no Rook end game now we have an offer to go a rook end game and we do uh excuse me not not a rook end game we have an offer to go to a minor piece end game KN versus Bishop so hikaro is like all right I mean he can't beat me I got Knight and six pawns what's he going to do now the way you win a position like this uh is uh you bribe your opponent uh and and and if that doesn't work because they're crypto billionaires uh then you um you know then then then you try to use your Pawn majority preferably you create an outside pass Pawn A&H pawns are are gods in these types of positions the center pawns can be caught much faster and you try to outflank with your king like a huge mistake here by black would be to play G6 H5 uh if you can't put the pawn on F6 like F5 H5 you don't want to create infiltrat holes in your position F6 and obviously as we can see both guys are trying to you know claim a little bit of Pawn Equity right there's F5 hikaro is trying to take some space and he gets a pass Pawn so hikaro now has a pass Pawn right King E7 but white controls a lot of the tempo and very nice idea there by the way way uh Knight takes H4 would have trapped the Knight so it would have gotten you to an end game like this where the bishop dominates the Knight I'm not sure that's really what you want considering you could go King F6 maybe but instead of that Hikaru uh plays Knight D6 and uh we have the following position and then a couple moves later we have the following position now that's that's a huge A5 is a massive commitment I mean clearly hikaro didn't like something about what could happen so he gives noer the past C Pawn I talked about winning one of these pawns for white would essentially win the game because the pawns are flank pawns and we have a scramble Knight E8 King C4 Knight F6 Bishop F3 and huro throws the e- pawn forward to go get that pawn but somehow he's not winning the pawn anymore because the pawn escapes and now if you go after the pawn with Knight d8 I bring my king and by the time you take the pawn you actually lose the king and pawn endgame because I out flank you and I win that pawn then I win that pawn and then I promote this is unbelievable and in the scramble we have like six or seven evaluation changes all of a sudden Hikaru is dominated because his Knight is stuck defending the pawn and it's got nowhere to go and if noer repositions the bishop the right way oh my God and no and apparently now it's a draw like apparently here if hikaro had gone uh King F6 King F6 is apparent I mean it it it's not findable we scramble we play 72 moves and hikaro resigns after winning with black in the first game hikaro loses two games and he loses to no abdor hikaro is now one and four he has won one match and he has lost four matches unbelievable just completely I I mean I I it's just it's insane I mean I I I have not I have no words because he looked so strong in that first game it was it was a crazy game but it was exactly what Karu needed two two days in a row he starts with a win he beats Ali Resa in that first game yesterday and then okay he loses to Magnus but Magnus is Magnus I mean there's not much you can do there shocking absolutely shocking what more to say which takes us to round number six now remember remember how this works I'm going to tell you about the standings there's eight players and it's around Robin so you can score seven points you can win each match the top two finishers make it automatically to the semi-finals the bottom two are gone you got to AV void bottom two if you get into survival stage 3 4 5 six those players play each other for the last two semi-final spots it's not over now Magnus needs to bounce back against Maxim VRA Maxim just caught momentum just beat Ali res it's a huge win Maxim defending with the black pieces right we go for a little Neo Catalan Magnus really delaying the Catalan not playing the move d4 so Maxim says okay I will D4 now Maxim's not a specialist in these positions frankly Maxim is not a specialist in most positions with a bishop on E7 and I just saw him downstairs that's not meant as an insult it's just that and I mean these guys can play any opening right but my point is that if you look at a history of games like Maxim puts the bishop on G7 he'd be doing that a lot so clearly you know this this is like you know he's going to he's going to have to come prepare for something like this and apparently here already the better move was C5 better apparently the way Magnus does this now is he gets the whole diagonal mvl tries to hold the Knight there so Magnus plays Knight C3 cuz he wants to play Knight A4 and then he wants to you know seize the center he also wants to play Knight E5 cuz all of a sudden black Pie has got no targets black pieces are like imagine you have a leak in the wall and you plug it with like a five karat diamond or like an expensive piece let's say you take your PS5 or your Nvidia graphics card and you play like what are you even doing right so that is essentially what is happening right here these pieces are about to get nicely PRI out of there and then they got nowhere to go and now Magnus takes a little bit more space with F4 gets his King off the diagonal and um I feel like nothing has happened in Maxim's position in like six moves Knight takes D4 look at Maxim's position notice how nothing is really going on like Queen E7 Rook nothing is going on so Magnus says well I've made maximum improvements with my Knights and Bishops so now I can actually create a samide pawn attack cuz I've just had such a head start look at me look at me hands in the air look it's good to be alive and I'm a famous rer for people in the pastol crookedy any of you know the flow Bots I can ride my bike with no handlebars talk about a throwback song bet you did not have that on your Gotham bingo card of things that I mentioned in my videos normally it's sports right anyway I mean it's like an avalanche now again look at Black's pawns and back row of pieces I mean Maxim is like playing bingo with these pieces it's he's struggling look at that look nothing has happened the bishop The Rook the bishop the bishop the queen The Rook it's it's just nothing you can do all of a you're still moving the same pieces you're still moving the same pieces and now Magus plays Knight F6 and said the game is just over I mean he just that was crazy and look I mean Maxim is one of the best players in the world but but I am just saying like familiarity matters familiarity matters in a certain position it's just what I think it's my opinion here to give you my opinion I just feel like you play some imbalanced position against Magnus he's going to try to take advantage in in various ways because maybe he's slightly more experienced and um yeah just G takes F6 Knight G5 Queen H6 just too many threats here and um there it is Queen H7 just takes back the Knight and um you can't get more convincing than that let's talk about a bounceback win for uh for Magnus he ends the day uh with five points out of six he is still at the top of the leader board uh Aliva fujio took down Dennis lazovic that was a that was three draws in the match so they drew both games again Dennis just a beast uh can Wesley so end the day six out of uh six out of six how about that for a question this is the Armageddon so they drew their first two games Wesley bids 9303 930 something and then plays the Queen's Gambit accepted now if you want to win against this with white you generally have to play E4 but maybe there's a whole lot of theory there that these guys don't really want to touch so instead we have just a classical line this is a very solid line but Knight C6 is a Seline A6 is generally the move now Wesley plays it immediately after but he's kind of inviting various things to happen in the center uh noer back here allows B5 tries to take advantage with A4 but Wesley clearly the experienced player and immediately starts being like yo what is ner doing because he's just going to go here castle and also grab a bishop on his way out and if he doesn't grab the bishop he's going to play C4 and maybe B3 and mummify the bishop Rook C8 like this bishop completely Cooks this bishop in a competition right Rook C8 there it is and I mean n's just going for an attack and Wesley's like um bro like okay you threaten mate and if I Castle you mate me on that square but what about this and if you just for a brief moment look at this position it's actually crazy like it it's the equivalent of driving a car into a wall for white like there is nothing here and Wesley's like a dojo Master he's just going to take all of that and be like that's all you got boom like Black's position is perfectly equipped for a Counterattack he uses his AG Pawn he doesn't even care that he's overextending because how is white going to guard the Knight he has to go here so now wasle boy forces uh an overextension so now white has to defend himself like that oops and who's guarding the bishop it's just insane I mean it completely and comprehensively refuted the white position I mean Armageddon is just weird you know and and then he plays D3 this man is this dude is threatening to trap this bishop it's the saddest set of Bishops I've ever seen it's like the king and the queen left and and these are like the little kids that want to sit in the chairs like I want a chance to sit in the throne I don't know why they sound like British kids but that's just my default accent you know uh and and then Wesley sacks his Rook just for you can't take because then the pawn traps The Rook no does take and then gives up but but just takes at just night bro this dude just sacked a second Rook there's just a rook it looks like Wesley hung The Rook in the corner which you might do but you can't take that I mean you can you can do whatever you want you just is going to lose black will play Queen D2 threaten mate and then and it's like insane white has all these pieces but they're not doing anything so Bishop takes h8 is not possible he goes Queen F2 and I mean Wesley just threatening to promote and just has to defend himself and Wesley likes to do this thing where he just makes draws he promotes to a rook because he's hilarious and he could do what he wants and uh Wesley likes to do this thing in the Armageddon where he makes draws out of totally winning positions so despite it being minus seven he repeats moves yeah like he's up three pawns but a draw is a win so he just uh and Wesley six and0 Wesley six and0 he's won every match that's just insane and um big matchup final matchup of the day that I have for you Hikaru looking to get a win versus Fabiano Carana it's Armageddon so these guys Drew their two games Hikaru now with the black pieces again he he has had a good run like he he has his score like he's playing close games but he he's got to get the job done it's a Rosal limo Sicilian it is a slight sideline where black plays D6 Bishop D7 we get a very close position and from the opening it looked a little dicey iaru started expanding on the queen side like like I'm talking really expanding on the queen side and then he was playing Knight D7 trying to provoke Fabby into spending some time and going forward Fabby played Bishop E3 still up 5 and a half minutes on the clock take take Queen C7 then Karo played A4 and he started kind of shutting down the queen side a little bit right Knight B6 E6 okay apparently a step in the wrong direction but now Fabby takes a step in the wrong direction as well Fabby apparently instead of Knight to G5 should have like opened up the position and just grabbed the pawn now for whatever reason he really didn't like this he he must have felt a little bit uneasy with the cannon kind of pointed the opposite way but then it was Knight G5 the Knight went back to d8 and uh C4 and for the second game in a row Kar was taking over in the Armageddon now he's still down four minutes five minutes almost six actually I can't do math but for the second Armageddon in a row The Comeback of Hikaru is well and good and it is alive Knight F3 E5 Bishop E3 and Hikaru is just doing great look at this position and the only thing that Fabby still has going for him is he has done a good job preserving the clock Advantage but this is a great position for black Fabby I mean Hikaru is gonna make a comeback rookie two black is better rookie two black is better apparently Hikaru can already begin Queen A5 Knight F6 targeting this hitting this hitting this maybe Knight H5 maybe Knight F4 maybe Knight F6 D5 if you're feeling spicy in the future taking D5 okay he plays Rook A8 he takes the file I he plays H4 because he doesn't really know what to do I mean probably does but you know he car attacks the pawn queen E1 completely taking over the game now Queen A5 I don't know why he car did not play Queen A5 I mean I'm not saying that Fabiano would have lost this Pawn I'm just saying as a human this to me looks like a very natural move and after Bishop D2 maybe you just keep coming down maybe you play Queen A7 hit the pawn I mean obviously it's a lot easier for us to sit here but in this position Hikaru plays Knight F4 which wins the bishop in the sense that you get rid of White's Bishop pair but suddenly all the pressure is off of White's Center and it is white who suddenly has the idea to go here launch the bishop at Black's position Knight Knight F4 is a massive decision and Hikaru plays it because he doesn't have a huge amount of time he's got to play fast and and and Fabby gets the pawn hearo gets this Pawn it's a very tense game so much is hanging on this game hikaro loses the pawn on D6 so he's now down a pawn and here comes Fabiano Hikaru is looking for a rook trade but after takes takes King H2 only one man is attacking the other and it's Fabiano caruana who gets the queen out of the way and just realizes yo I have a pass Pawn too and I have a pawn that could open up hearo King let me just guard everything and at some point my pawns are going to go not just one but both and my friends I regret to inform the Karo fans out there but the attack crashed through and on the 52 move of this game Hikaru resigned Hikaru resigned Fabiano won his match and hearo lost both matches today and these are your standings after six rounds Wesley so is perfect Magnus is with five out of six they are both I think mathematically guaranteed to make the semifinals if Magnus wins but Wesley loses the final day of the round robin Wesley wins the head-to-head cuz he won the head to head head match if Fabiano wins but Magnus loses I think Magnus won the head-to-head so the question tomorrow is it is Hikaru versus lazovic Hikaru must win and alyza who is playing Magnus must lose and I'm not sure what happens in the match up of Maxim but I think if Maxim ties with Hikaru he knocks him out because of head-to-head cuz he beat him in a match this is crazy this is shocking I mean I I I I'm FL I I don't even know what this I I hope everything is all right with Hikaru this is a a completely uncharacteristic performance and I mean I I guess it happens I guess it happens we I'm a fan of hikaro obviously I'm biased I would much rather see him in top six and top two than than where he is and uh it's shocking but um credit to Wesley so who is just an absolute killer right now uh not all of you agree with me about hikaro some people root for and against others but uh yeah if Magnus Carlson doesn't show up tomorrow against ala fua then hikaru's match doesn't matter but I think Magnus is required by contract to show up so um crazy absolutely just absolutely insane completely insane um what to say I will see you all tomorrow and tomorrow we will see who uh makes the top four tomorrow we have the last round of the round robin and then we have a uh then we have the the survival stage hope you enjoyed the recap get out of here
