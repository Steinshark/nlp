ladies and gentlemen it is with great pleasure that I welcome you back to Freestyle chess 2024 this is a very fascinating event it's the first of its kind this is day one of two in the finals it's Magnus Carlson versus Fabiano caruana now that's actually kind of funny because they're the top two players in the world right now and they already played a world championship match against each other in 2018 so we could play Fisher random or we could play regular chess and these guys are still going to make it to the finals now a friendly reminder we are playing like I just said Fisher random so the back row of pieces is shuffled every single round uh and my location is currently shuffled because I'm not at home I'm actually in Charlotte North Carolina for the ches kid national festival I also have an event tonight in Charlotte with just like a little bit of tickets remaining so if you want some food and drinks and uh yeah I'll put a link in the description if you are in the Charlotte area um and also I recently dropped a Scandinavian defense course so for the next three days courses are 25% off only for the next three days uh let me tilt this up a little bit here we go now uh I will of course be showing you the match between Fabiano and Magnus we also have the third place match between NOC abdulov and leevon aronian we have alira fuja and gukesh playing for uh uh fourth and fifth place and we also are rather fifth and sixth and this is the seventh and eighth place match now um I've been covering ding L Ren this entire tournament if you don't know dingl Ren is the reigning defending world champion of classical chess uh Magnus gave away his title because he actually wanted to go pursue golf competitively many of you who know basketball uh may remember Michael Jordan one stepped away from the game in order to go play baseball which is not a real sport um I'm just kidding the last time I said that in a video a lot of baseball enthusiasts got upset uh but yeah Michael Jordan stepped away from the game Magnus is stepping away from the game uh to go play golf dingly Ren has not won a game in this tour tournament I'm not exaggerating this is day six six days of Chaz dingl Ren has not won a game something's got to change so he keeps playing they play for seventh and eighth place Vincent kimer plays the move d4 and this is our starting setup like I said randomly selected before the game so it's always interesting where the players are going to Castle how they're going to play the opening we will compare every single opening ding plays G6 okay plays G6 in order obviously to open up the queen cuz you kind of have to uh and then uh Knight F3 and he plays F5 so it's quite clear ding you know will probably put a knight on F6 and then it's just a question of is he going to Castle his King that way because then he'll need to remove quite a bit of pieces or will he Castle short now Vincent opens up his Rook right away which is really interesting that now his just his Rook is standing in the center of the board I don't really know what his idea was against Knight F6 uh but we're not even going to have to find out because ding plays D5 okay fair enough and The Rook just goes back to the home square but this is basically meaning that white can't Castle short anymore it's it the fish a random freestyle chest is very weird and yet look at the evaluation and now look at the evaluation after one pawn move a pawn move getting Center space winning a Tempo and opening the bishop and now white is just better by like 6 why is that well apparently uh the move D5 is so weakening of the dark squares in the center like when you commit a pawn anytime you move anything in chest something gets stronger something gets weaker something gets forgotten and something now you might claim but in this case because you play D5 you completely abandon the Quest for this square and it's a lesson in moving your Pawn so now Knight E6 and C3 uh ding plays C5 to continue to try to open up that side of the board now as you can already see this is the sixth move of the game and from the opening uh it is actually Vincent with a already commanding Advantage now the move C5 ding played really fast really fast um which is quite a big decision I mean I have to tell you 96 and C5 and Bishop F4 check how does black stop the check black stops the check by blocking and losing the right to Castle so ding's King is on C7 now why is he playing like what why is he playing so provocatively this is what I don't understand Knight E3 he gives this check gives up the bishop and now I guess he's just going to try to stabilize but Vincent very quickly castles has three and three Pawn structure that's still a gaping hole in the center the queen is probably going to open up or maybe he's going to try to bring you know the the G Pawn forward and maybe he'll play H4 and bring the queen up but the position just looks very good for White Queen G first he plays F3 then he plays Queen G1 and he's complet he's completely winning tingly Ren has played 11 games in this event uh he has three draws and eight losses and in this game he's already worse from the sixth move I mean this is unfathomable now of course I understand if you're knocked out of an event and clearly you're not in good form can you imagine getting knocked out of a tournament and you're like going to go home and they're like nope you got to play again and you're like but I lost and they're like yeah but you got to play this other guy that lost for clear you know reasons because they just you know they like I I get it you know I understand but he has struggled and I mean Vincent shows absolutely no mercy in this game Knight B5 uh he takes on D5 he doubles up he's just the pawn up he trades everything and he just goes here and and and and uh ding resigns ding resigns ding has played 12 games he has three draws and nine losses I this is It's a shocking stuff and again I have to cover all the games it's not like look I'm I'm feir to every player I'm not you're not insulting anybody by showing their games but this is just shocking to see I mean it really is I I I don't know how to feel about the whole thing I really don't I I I don't feel good about it um but I have to show the games and ding has you know he he's a game away from ending the event but he hasn't won now this is a match up for fifth and sixth place these guys obviously defeated their seventh and eighth place counterparts uh gukesh beat kimer and Ali Resa beat ding uh and you know again we are going to comp openings in every game this one has a totally different opening uh than this one which uh is very interesting we have we have like a a weird Dutch with f5g G6 in this game and a very quick E4 in this game we do have E4 but we have a much more locked type of maneuvering game as the guys get their Knights out very slowly and already gukesh has an advantage on the sixth move which is- which is very fun uh and his Advantage rests in the fact that he can play for F5 and he does he immediately attacks the center of the board and According to stockfish which of course doesn't know much about Fisher random or freestyle chess or chess 960 black is better uh the reason that black is better is I guess white is a little bit passive I think fua had set up a position where he might be able to Castle quickly either direction like the king could Castle this way or this way but now he has to play gash's game and explode the center of the board GES captures baiting Ali's pieces forward rips open the center once again and plays this very nice and calm Queen G8 and I think the point is that it's very difficult for white to make commitment for example if white commits this way uh how's the Queen ever getting out right uh you know black is going to park the KN on F4 and it's going to be a really really nice position okay so let me refresh the board so instead of that he commits this King this way and here for reasons I don't quite understand gukesh did not play A5 you know again opposite side castling in this case black hasn't castled yet but you got a king castled over there why wouldn't you just start a pawn attack that's that doesn't happen it just doesn't happen um I don't know what he didn't like about this move clearly something puts his Knight on F4 instead and uh that's not considered a good move it would have it was considered better to go uh A5 now Knight F4 and uh Al is so clutch D5 right away D5 right away occupying Central space opening up the diagonal and immediately the advantage is completely gone for black like one pawn move and suddenly gcash has to begin uh and you'll notice how has to spend 17 minutes on pushing upon one square this is why it's going to be really hard to get chess on television by the way I say this a lot but 17 minutes he's just sitting there and then he just now imagine explaining that meanwhile you know we have like the biggest pop icons in the world attending American football games and we've got you know killi and mbappe not committing back to PSG and God we have so much stuff and this is just you know I don't know I don't know how we're going to do it Bishop F5 take take take take G3 take on D5 Al Resa says you can have my Pawn but by taking the pawn you open up my rook and you open up my queen because now my queen actually can activate Knight D4 and the Knight strolls into the black position gkes has a problem with this King he's not he can't he can't save it yet he doesn't have a way he can put it rookie eight and Ali Reza a man after my own heart good man sacrifices The Rook I don't want to yell him in a hotel room and they're cleaning outside and I'm kind of embarrassed so I'm not going to yell he sacrificed The Rook they can't hear me pawn takes Queen takes now Oz is just threatening to win the game Queen D6 is just devastating so Bishop C7 and he takes on F5 so ultimately alza has a horse and a pawn for The Rook he also has very active pieces this Knight is a beast and one more thing that he can do is he has what's called a pawn majority he has three pawns versus one which is a huge problem because as those pawns begin moving up they begin threatening to Queen and if you can't stop them because they're escorted so effectively by all the other pieces this is a fake Advantage for black A5 now here Ali Reza plays a gangster move I love the this move bro he plays King D2 I can't even begin to explain the move King D2 to you I don't even get it like why didn't he just play F4 maybe he was worried about Rook A6 and Rook C6 maybe he needed to defend his Rook that's probably what it was he needed to defend the Knight against Rook takes Rook that is so crazy so in the middle of this game he just straight up plays King D2 like what a hero I I mean what a hero of a move now the Knight can move and if Rook takes Rook it's not check and also it's protected since Rook takes Rook is not check wherever White's Knight moves on the next move it can then move again right so Bishop B6 Here Comes F4 gkes brings The Rook Here Comes G4 Here Comes B4 closing down the queen side he gets his Bishop out of the way and now he can threaten a queen trade he is threatening a queen trade that's not really a sentence that you hear very often in chess but right now the transition to the end game would win for white so you can't do that Queen D5 Rook E4 uh-oh uhoh clearly the queen going out here the queen going on a little spiritual journey to A4 was a fatal mistake and Rook E4 not only stabilizes the position white is now winning because B5 traps the queen basically instead of that the computer says Guk should have gone Bishop F2 and if Rook went up he should have threatened his own Queen trade and then doubled his Rooks and taken on C3 yeah but he uh walks his Queen out and immediately is just losing and Ali Resa swarms what a devastating attack trades the Bishops uh there he could have here he could have played Rook C4 so the game you know he did not convert it with stockfish is full blessing but clearly from start to finish it was all Ali Reza he he finds Rook C4 and the pawn just goes so again if we watch the game without stockfish smooth sailing Rook F4 the idea is rook f8 and um clean game by him so Ali Resa wins uh Vincent wins his game now it's time for the bronze medal match between nobec Abdu satov and leevon aronian let's remind everybody of the openings that we've seen thus far in this game we have D4 F5 we have Knight G3 and we have D5 okay so Levon plays a Stonewall The Stonewall Dutch with the pawns on the light squares and then control over the light squares here but of course very different you'll remember that dingly Ren played D5 which weaken the dark squares but the difference is that in this game white has not played E4 so white hasn't actually activated the rook and actually a couple of moves later the guys are just mirroring each other so they're both fighting for completely different things right white is going to control the dark squares and maybe black will try to undermine uh black is going to control the light squares and maybe white will try to undermine terrific Knight 8 D7 A4 A5 now the queen gets into the action look at the queen activating right away E3 white is Rock Solid on the dark squares we have a night trade we're probably going to get a night another night trade pretty soon here comes Noank undermining like I said and here come the knights off the board okay so we have a position of Bishops queens and Rooks it's a position where the guys hate horses they are not into that stuff uh so Queen can activate on the file it's already I guess activated more like pressure on the file question of what's going to happen here with these pawns nobec had a position yesterday very similar to this he had a position of no horses versus Magnus Carlson uh Bishop to G4 is played which apparently is wrong uh I don't really understand why it's wrong so I'm you know but but Bishop G4 targeting the pawn is apparently completely incorrect Rook f8 would be strong and after Queen E2 you can take the pawn bait the queen to come forward and then play Bishop to B4 and claim that you are better because you have the active Rook this is actually extremely reminiscent of nbe's game yesterday against Magnus which he ended up uh losing uh so again no he drew yesterday but he was losing and he could have lost the match Bishop B4 did lose the match but could have lost it two- Z Now Levon here makes a bad decision he takes on C4 in this version why Levon refused to put the Rook on f8 I don't know because yes it destabilizes E6 but you're defending it twice and the trade-off would be you get the f file so listen he's like an elite player and he's playing for the bronze medal and not me but I don't know what the difference is between these moves maybe he thought here white would have to play Queen C4 but noyre finds a very well-timed Bishop trade understanding that this Pawn is not going anywhere understanding that Levon has another weakness here and after this trade even though Levon is able to create this bind in the center we have Bishop takes C4 and uh yeah nybeck never got kicked off the f file so again just a really big question of why did Levon not play Rook to f8 don't know can't really explain it to you now he plays Rook f8 okay but uh he could have played it like 8 ago I don't know why he didn't do it now Bishop takes and this is the real problem now if Norbeck plays Rook takes he loses the rook and he loses a queen because it's a fork if he plays Pawn takes uh if Levon plays Pawn takes this Pawn becomes a passer it's got nothing in its way right and if he plays Rook takes F2 white will play Bishop takes B7 which is called a Zin Zug and then he's going to lose the bishop for a pawn and then take back so you can't do that which means after Pawn takes and King a too and even this trade only Nock is better Nock has a pass Pawn not only does he have a pass Pawn it's protected and that is protected so in all end games this is a nightmare for black to deal with because now all black has to do is worry about that pawn if that pawn was like back here there would be no activity for white but no matter what type of end game you go for now that pawn is going to be a problem it's going to be a biggest biggest type of problem in a king and pawn end game cuz in a king and pawn end game Black's King can go forward Queen E6 Rook C1 so no just basically gets into a really nice position plays Rook C5 you can't take the Rook as the queen is pinning the the pawn to the queen queen F7 Queen B5 making Levon play really passive defense he could trade in this position again I don't know why he can't trade and play Rook F2 but he just takes the file right away and then starts advancing his Pawn just taking space away from black letting Black's Pawn sit back there really a masterful technique C5 though Levon quick with counterplay trying to destabilize White Center and trying to land White in a situation where if you allow Pawn takes Pawn takes black also has a pass Pawn then it's anybody's game so C5 is a very very well-timed strike now we have dc5 counterplay created by Levon Pawn to D4 discovered attack with the queen and the pawn gets to D3 and not only does it get to D3 it gets to D2 which apparently is wrong there's a saying in chess the threat is more valuable than the execution all right the threat just the threat of the pawn advancing is scary white has to respect it but the second the Pawn goes it's no longer as defended as it was and Rook D1 immediately he swarms leevon has 40 seconds Queen goes back to B3 pinning the rook and now we end up in an end game where nck is winning Levon had to take on C he had to uh bring his King actually that apparently Rook E5 Rook D7 and now nck is simply going to convert this end game this is a completely winning end game uh because first of all white is up Aon Pawn which is important in Rook end games but more importantly than that uh White is set to win a second Pawn that's the most important thing so for example if you play in this position Rook G4 black has to protect himself like there is no option right and now Rook G6 check is just winning a second Pawn so that's it King C5 Rook H6 the only thing that black has here is activity okay so black can play King B4 black can play King C4 right and go for this Pawn like black can maybe go for this pawn and try to promote cuz white is a little bit stuck so we have Rook to G5 counterattacking the pawn on G2 now what you don't want to do here which is instructive you don't want to play Rook H2 because now black will play King C4 Rook G3 and the position is completely miserable for you like you can't move you can't move either piece so temporary fix but you don't actually fix the root cause right so instead of that a better move here is to actually activate the king believe it or not lose a pawn with check but play King C3 and Rook E2 now you can play Rook H5 and bring the king or try to win this pawn and maybe you can win the long-term end game nordbeck plays here and Levon finds this and for a brief moment in time Noir Abdu satov would have been up three Pawns in a rook end game but the position is a draw that is crazy and the reason it's a draw is that if you save your Pawn you don't save anything because I take and that is crazy it's stalemate black is stalemated there are no legal moves in this position and the craziest part is if you try to get out of stalemate you get get mated oh that is brutal that is tough oh my God oh my what can you even say about that Nock Abdu satov was going to be up three Pawns in a rook end game and the game is still going to end in a draw so instead of that he goes here and it doesn't matter cuz black activates his King he's going to win The Pawn on E3 he wins this one he goes here he's going to win that one too and the game is a draw how insane is that what an attack by nck who was just winning but he I guess he just needed to bring his King a little bit faster I mean he played exactly what you're supposed to do maybe in this position he could have played King C2 but as you can see from the evaluation it's kind of undecided right I mean you would think being up two Pawns in a rook in game is completely winning but black activated his King and it was anything it was anything but easy so they make a draw now we go to the main event of the evening I'm just going to back up to look at the opening and we have Fabiano Carana Magnus Carlson and this one actually very similar to the first game that we see but we have E4 we have E5 so completely different openings in every single game totally different all right now Fabiano here can do a lot of things he can push and turn the game into a very imbalanced type of like King's Indian structure uh or he can take which is slightly more boring but the point is that the structure is fixed and black can't activate his Queen and Rook as he kind of smart then he puts his Bishop over here very natural development actually then he develops this bishop in the Knight very principled man and then he castles so Fabiano in the first nine moves basically has like exactly what you want in a game of chess uh and uh Magnus is on the back foot I mean Fabiano has a very very pleasant opening development sounds upstairs like somebody just dropped 1005b pingpong walls I hope that noise is only during the day and not at night cuz if I got to listen to that at night I might have to throw hands Knight comes out to E6 for Magnus and you would love to play Knight D5 here with white just try to go after the bishop but he's just going to go here and uh somebody's going to have to protect this pawn and after somebody protects this Pawn he's going to kick your knight out you kind of get nowhere so that's not going to work all right so instead of that Queen F1 both guys bring their Queens just like we saw in the game between noer Beck and Levon Bishop C4 targeting the Knight but now a well-timed Counterattack Knight to B6 it's actually really difficult to break through the position here the computer for white already wants to play A4 just absentmindedly trying to grab some space but it's already just Black's position is too stable and you kind of go back to the beginning and wonder well Fabiano did not have to take you know maybe fi just wanted some stability he kind of wanted an easy game where he doesn't have to think of all the intricacies uh and he does try to get a little bit provocative here by giving up his Bishop which obviously traditionally giving up a bishop for a knight like this is not particularly good um which the engine liked for black but neither guy liked it for black that's why Fabby played Knight D5 he invited Magnus to take and he invited Magnus to help activate his Queen Magnus thought for a bidden Play Bishop A3 so just trying to trade off the Bishops Bishop takes A3 King to B1 and now Magnus as quickly as he got in he got out in and out cuz the the pawn on F6 was hanging so he comes out of the position and he still hasn't committed his King he still hasn't touched this bishop he hasn't moved four pieces but somehow his position is really really resilient and uh now it's up to Fabby like Fabby can go for A4 A5 and he does he plays A4 weakening his King and trying to play the move A5 black can play A5 but that would weaken the structure so he doesn't instead it's time for Fabiano's Knight to make a decision in the center of the board which way is it going to go take take by the way Black's King now might not even have to Castle right both guys have Rooks both guys have bishop and Knight both guys have Queens the structure is these three versus these three you know Queen D3 Queen D6 looks pretty good but how are you going to get any of these pawns active right in any chance game in any middle game you're looking at what can I do with my knight what can I do with my Bishops my Rooks my queen what can I do with my pawns the answer not a whole lot and Fabi actually does something really shocking here he gives the bishop for the Knight which is nuts um and both guys miss an idea here they Magnus just takes back with the bishop because it would be deranged to take back with the rook and yet apparently if you take back with the Rook there's an idea here which is B5 and the point is that you're going to get some help not only are you going to get some help but like obviously you have Queen A3 but Queen A3 on its own is not going to you have CB and The Rook joins the attack both guys totally miss a chance now I don't know if they saw something I don't know if they hallucinated clearly they just thought take take I'm going to centralize my queen I'm going to put my queen here and as you can see the position is balanced Bishop here Rook E6 and pawn to B5 creating an attack on Fabiano's king would have been absolutely brw Force I mean I don't know what he had planned there like if he tries to play C4 stopping B5 that doesn't stop anything if you play C takes B5 C takes B5 Queen takes B5 you're up a pawn but rook aa6 and hello we teaming up on the B file it's actually wees King who's much weaker this is nuts so both guys miss Rook takes E6 B5 I mean I I don't know if they either missed it underestimated it miscalculated they could have seen it calculated decided that it was fine but as far as I can see rookie 6 and B5 would have been a monstrous chance here and it's rare but you know it's rare that the top two players in the world Miss such an idea but clearly they had stability on their minds you know it was Valentine's Day nice and stable and nice and stable it stayed because they traded literally uh well they they could have you know they could have played like here here here here and made a draw uh but then white actually would have been a touch better because he would have actually activated his pawns quite quickly instead of that they shuffled their pieces back and forth and um draw is made none of this none of that uh although you know again Fabiano could have claimed he has control of the dark squares but no a very peaceful resolution on day number one a completely non-p peaceful resolution in the game between nerick and Levon which was a potential three pawns down end game that was still a draw by some sort of Miracle so the winner of freestyle chess 24 will be crowned tomorrow uh Fabiano and Magnus have played many many many epic matches against each other and hopefully tomorrow uh hopefully tomorrow we get a big tie break hopefully it doesn't just end in the first classical game Magnus will have the white pieces but in Fisher random that doesn't always mean an advantage tomorrow we will Crown a bronze medal winner between leevon and nerc GES versus Ali Reza and uh we'll see if dingl Ren gets a win on the board in this event because that is an absolutely crazy score line that he has right now uh that's all I have for you today uh if you're in Charlotte and you don't have tickets for some reason to the ches national festival make sure to check it out uh or the event tonight uh or not and all courses are 25% off all right I'm going to go get some lunch get out of here
