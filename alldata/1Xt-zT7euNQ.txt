the internet this past week has been going wild [Music] we've always been a wild place okay true it is always wild but especially this week with the announcement the recent announcement of chat GPT or open ai's new plugin that's released which is code interpreter now this is still enclosed Alpha form so it's not available to everyone just yet you do need to sign up to have access to it but this plugin specifically is a game changer for not only people who work in Tech but also to for companies as a whole let me show you what exactly I mean the plugin offered by chat GPT called code interpreter is really going to change the way we work with AI with technology in so many matters I'm going to read to you exactly what the company says that it does the plugin offers a working python interpreter in a sandboxed environment also to according to open API AI the plugin can effectively solve mathematical problems both qualitative and quantitative perform data analysis data visualization and also convert files across formats I've seen a lot of times gifts being created with this and to a lot of people uploading interesting CSV files and now this code interpreter taking it and turning it into Data visualization this is the end of everyone in the data World data analysts and data scientists or is this a tool that they can really use and hone in on let's go through some examples of what people are building with this I don't have access to it at this moment I input my information on my fingers crossed that I get access to it soon so in the meantime let's go through some there was this individual this user on Twitter here that uploaded a CSV file of every Lighthouse location in the US it's said to chat GPT code interpreter create a gif of a map of the lighthouse locations where the map is very dark but each Lighthouse twinkles a couple seconds later this appeared where it's a full-blown GIF and it's accurate as to where lighthouses are located in the US now you might be thinking today seem so small who cares who created a gift but when you think of this at a larger scale how it is able to really take data and information and output it in a way that is visualized humans can understand there are endless possibilities when we think businesses utilizing this for their data when we think individuals being able to before this you would have to write so much code to get this or use other programs this you literally can put in plain English what you want and receive data visualization as the output all right let's look at another example so this Twitter user actually input to analyze 300 hours of Spotify favorites playlist with chatgpt code interpreter GPT showed me how to export from the Spotify API ran multi-dimensional PCA and tsne Analysis analysis cats speak today all these words and summarize my taste for me it's wild look at these graphs they are so detailed and then you go in the thread here you can see uh different tweets around it where this individual is creating more graphs and the details for this graph are Next Level now a lot of people are asking are these graphs actually accurate and so far the people who have had access to playing around with them are saying they are they are producing real data or correct data now this could vary based on what information the code interpreter is getting access to if you're uploading something such as a CSV of course it's going to have that specific data and be very accurate versus if you're asking it to get data from the internet maybe it might not be so accurate maybe it will but this is just the tip of the iceberg I want to remind you chat GPT was released in November November of last year that's less than a year ago and I know some of us are so tired of talking about this chat gbt and AI but it really is different than the hype it was around web3 and nfts meaning that really blew up and then it came back down I think this hype with AI is here to stay why I think that is because we are seeing direct impact for people's jobs both positive and negative livelihoods companies really adopting to AI at a much different rate a much quicker rate than we were with nfts that was a very specific niche of individuals who really got into it with AI this feels much bigger and much more permanent in the sense of it's happening today not theoretically in what could happen it's here today the tools are being built and they're continuing to iterate at a really quick rate now we've been really speaking about how the code interpreter can create data visualizations but let's dive into other things it can do one being simple video editing the code interpreter can not only handle gifts but also to other file formats this user here Riley who is actually a prompt engineer recently prompted it to do this he uploaded a gif and asked chatgpt to convert it into an mp4 was a dramatic Zoom very dramatic effect chat T doesn't store the data for an extreme amount of time so if you come back or you wait a while the data might be gone and you might have to reprompt it but it will output so look at this output here if you hover over the video you can see there's this dramatic slow Zoom this is wild this will change the game not only for people who are working in Tech but also to content creators for people who are wanting to get into content creation this is really fascinating it is really interesting when you start thinking about how this will play a role into so many people's jobs and I don't think it's at the point where it's going to necessarily take away a lot of people's jobs yet but I do think it's a tool we really need to learn how to embrace and utilize question though don't just take everything for as it comes to you but question it is this ethical is this right is AI even moving in the right way is there any controls around it what does that mean there's a lot going on on that side of things I mean we've seen uh The Godfather of AI uh Jeffrey he recently quit Google and now is advocating for the dangers around AI or spreading the word there are many stories like that out there so although I'm sharing with you about Tools around AI it's definitely something you need to really take a step back think of the big picture and question why we talk about these tools and why I think they are important to be aware of is because it's going to happen and sticking your head in a hole and just pretending it's not there or that this is a silly little thing that's going to go away in my opinion is the wrong way to be if you are looking to advance and evolve with technology and AI the other thing we really have to note is from the time chat GPT was released till now developers have really gotten their hands on open ai's API and been able to really build and tinker and build really crazy interesting things with it as this technology becomes more available to engineers and Builders out there and more things are continuing to be built we will see technology naturally evolve at a quicker Pace yes even quicker than it is today which is why it brings up a lot of mixed emotions in many of us but at the end of the day we are all in this together which for some reason brings me peace I don't know I guess if you're out of a job sitting on a beach then I'll join you sip in a margarita or something no but at the end of the day let's embrace it let's grow with it evolve with it and that's all we can do question things but be aware of this really interesting technology coming out code interpreter was just one plug-in out of many plugins that were recently released it is the one of the plugins that are really trending right now with the examples I have shown you for good reason seeing how quickly it is able to take raw data and transform it is pretty wild if you ask me curious to hear your thoughts on Chachi PT's code interpreter are you for it are you against it have you played around with it leave in
