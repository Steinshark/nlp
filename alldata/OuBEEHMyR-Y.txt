ladies and gentlemen welcome to one of the most insane chess videos you will probably ever see a fair warning for those of you who have watched my channel for a long time I'm currently in Charlotte North Carolina that's why this looks like I'm in a safe house bunker hiding out in witness protection and if you've never seen my channel well usually I don't film from a hotel room so you you got to take my apology you got to accept my apology because this video deserves fireworks explosions in the background but instead of all that we're going to get a hotel room video and why this video is insane is not because I'm in a hotel room but because in this video I'm going to cover one of the craziest world records that recently happened on chess.com and that is hikara Nakamura getting the rating of 3,45 in Blitz chess 3,45 which is literally 3,000 points higher than some of you in Blitz chest some of you are rated 400 Blitz imagine being 3,000 points higher than that that is nuts he took down the record of Magnus Carlson and not only that at some point during this run to 345 listen to what I'm about to tell you Hikaru played 174 games 174 and of those games he lost three three he lost three games out of 174 he won 159 games and made 12 draws and lost three games I don't even I don't know how that's possible and in this video I will show you on my travel setup like I said this video deserves explosions and fireworks but instead we are going to climb the rating ladder with Hikaru and watch as he takes down opponent after opponent in a variety of different playing Styles in a variety of different openings we will showcase all of his incredible skills uh and we are going to climb the ladder to the rating of 3,45 on this absolutely monster streak that has never been duplicated never been replicated uh yeah only it's just he's just leaving his opponents devastated so first game I have for you hekaru down at you know the measly pathetic rating of 3,326 his opponent is Arun who's a Grandmaster I believe from India and in this game hikaro plays my favorite the caroan but he plays the hikaro he plays the hikaro Khan uh I need help and this is this one this is called the gurgan uh the modern defense with C6 and G6 it is one of the ways uh of playing uh the caran I have a bunch of wires here that I'm going to move uh like my microphone wire so he plays this C6 G6 caroan this is one of hikaru's favorite openings actually opponent plays E5 and Hikaru takes control of the light squares this is one of the ways to deal with an opponent that's trying to take space away from you and then you're going to put a bishop out on these squares put a knight on on those squares here we see Hikaru doing exactly that this bishop is ready to perish for the benefit of society and we see exactly that but now you know instead of taking hikaro actually decides to back up and his idea with backing up rather than capturing is that I think he wants to take with the G Pawn it's way too dangerous to take with the E Pawn after Bishop F5 EF5 white can even already consider sacrificing the pawn weakening your position but okay I mean taking on F3 is more normal but you got to remember Hikaru can't draw anybody he's 300 points higher rated than people so if he makes a draw he loses like seven points so not only does hikaro have to win every single game he's at a point where he could beat somebody four uh 10 times and lose like once and that's going to be the exact same type of rating gain for him so hikaro has to take massive risks in many games and if he doesn't take massive risks this is basically what happens he gets himself into a very locked very close position from which is very difficult to create winning chances now he's doing his best okay look at hikaro structure his opponent has a bunch of Pawns on dark squares so hikaro has taken over the light squares and now he's going to try to advance on that side of the board for now he's leaving his King in the center while locking down the position he's not touching the king he now trades the Queens we are now in a queenless middle game there's a lot of pieces on the board and in these types of positions in these close positions we look at Pawn breaks peace maneuvering doubling on this file let's watch Hikaru overtake his opponent the other thing about is about Hikaru is he's so fast he always puts pressure on you on the clock he makes life extremely annoying for you extremely uncomfortable for you always trying to you know make something happen and he's always overloading your nervous system so you'll notice that white ends up shuffling back in forth here to just try to gain some time but look at Hikaru just effortlessly gliding into the position takes down the A2 Pawn he's ready go to go for the C3 Pawn as well takes takes making it look easy sacrificing his Rook by the way to win the base of the white Pawn chain and this is a completely winning position cuz white just uh can't stop these pawns so Hikaru knew that you see his opponent played Knight C2 saying oh you can't take my Rook because at the end I have night before check yeah hearu spent 13 seconds calculated literally the end of the entire game gets to this position picks up the rest of the the pawns and uh White is not going to be able to stop his pawns he gets his B Pawn all the way to B2 you can play Knight C5 you can take he takes back there's no stopping the pawn so he takes back King B7 Rook is hanging Pawn is about to promote effortless game W it at like 96% accuracy against the 3,000 rated grandmas and he makes it look so simple I mean it really just absolutely spectacular he played a title Tuesday a little bit later this is 3326 let's keep moving up the ranks this is Grandmaster lequang Lim a world Blitz Champion I believe in 2017 in this game his opponent plays um Knight F6 against hikaru's Bishop's opening and plays C6 D5 one of the most aggressive ways to play and we have this position where black extends very early trades in the center hikaro immediately goes for an attack okay plays Knight G5 castles take take take hi Caro's got a strong Knight he's going to try to get his Queen into the game he's going to try to get the bishop into the game and like I said like last game it was a very locked structure hikaro playing a very locked position this is a very different type of game this a very open open board so Bishops are powerful queens and everything like that look at Hikaru Queen H5 Bishop G5 already loading up the Cannons on the black position hikaro is already almost winning uh if black plays B6 for example white just wins here by playing Knight F6 check after Pawn takes Bishop takes black is so cramped you can't stop mate you just have no way to stop Queen G5 you can play here after which I would take and play Queen G5 so already he's on the verge of Landing a knockout punch but obviously Liam is doing a good job defending he's going to play C5 and maybe get the over here and now Hikaru plugs another piece into the attack with F4 it's so fun watching the best players in the world cultivate these attacks CU Hikaru is going to get to a point where both Rooks are playing both Bishops Knight and queen are playing last game was this kind of like boring maneuvering game trying to like trick his opponent in a close position win a pawn win an endgame this is just like lights out bulletproof attacking chess an excellent Pawn break to activate his Rook takes he doesn't even take back Rook ae1 a Zen Zug opening up that e file and threatening that F6 check black has to cover up here comes Hikaru now taking the pawn back applying a little bit more pressure and now beautiful Knight F6 check and I told you that hearo is a menace on the clock too always seems to be up on time he wins a queen he backs up and this is just the winning position you can't take because of the pin white is going to play H4 H5 and Black's position already in Dire Straits with a lot of weaknesses black tries to create some counter play but it's just not good enough Queen F3 Queen B7 and hikaro is going to start picking up the pawns and he picks up one he picks up the second one and Liam just resigns or basically runs out of time which is essentially the same thing uh an absolutely bulletproof showing against a very very very very good Grandmaster like kuang Liam is like a top 10 top 15 Grandmaster on the planet so I mean you can just imagine playing a game like that against one of the best players in the world and just making it look so simple starting out with The Bishop's opening and then the second that your opponent tries to mess around with you you don't even let that happen de the Knight goes to G5 Knight C3 the best move for black would have been to play D4 but as we've already seen Hikaru is a very very good close position player as well so black could have castled white would have went for C3 or castles H3 started some attack on this side of the board anyway that was completely effortless but Hikaru can get it done in attacking games in open games and closed games here's his next round in that same title Tuesday 3335 against Grandmaster Benjamin Bach his name is not Benjamin this is Benjamin I don't know why it's cut off but the analysis tab has been doing that for some reason C4 B6 Bishop B7 and this one takes a very critical nature right away as Hikaru opens up the center and we have this very obscure position right where white is sniping at the black is sniping at the White Center E6 this is anything but a closed position it's very open Rook D1 Bishop F4 okay C5 now in this game Bach is actually out the gate playing very quickly but here he plays Queen E2 which is the best move and now he plays this idea D5 opening up the center and the position completely explodes here as hikaro takes the pawn Bach takes here opening hikaru's King and now Rook takes D5 and Rook D1 take take so in equal position but in the last move bog spent a minute on Rook D1 50 seconds not a minute he spent 50 seconds on Rook D1 and like I told you Hikaru is so good with with the clock so he'll put pressure on you in a variety of ways he'll attack you if the position demands an attack he'll play the clock if the position Demands a clock uh de demands clock play he has an imbalance of Pawns right two three but he has an imbalance of Pawns here as well two and three Hikaru is going to utilize that watch what he does Queen here didn't even spend any time Queen D3 King back doesn't spend any time C4 Rook E8 3 seconds on that move no trade that's very clever he spends some time here for sure but he backs up and his his idea is to keep the tension keep pieces on the board H3 gets the Knight out Rook D7 activates his Bishop here and now he decides okay I'm going to make a calculated decision here to trade the Queens CU my idea is to Target my opponent's pawns and I told you that's all the imbalance that he needs 110 he did all of that in about 5 Seconds leaving his opponent with 9 seconds on the clock hikaro is so nasty at this he's so good at just making life a nightmare for his opponents especially low on time Rook B7 watch him defend everything like a Jaguar Bishop C7 he guards that Bishop D6 pinning him gives a check gets out of the pin and pushes the pawn wide down to 7 Seconds every decision has to be made instantly and when you're low on time you start getting desperate playing moves like G4 B4 from Hikaru holding everything together and now look at this bishop E7 a clean move you can't take you can take once but you can't take twice because if you take twice they're C2 but what's crazy is that according to the engine you can take and after C2 there's Rook E8 King H7 G6 King G6 Knight E5 King F6 Knight D3 so the thing is Hikaru might be refuted in a bullet game by stockfish but he makes life so practically challenging for a human being like no human would play Rook takes Knight here it's just not even something that occurs with 6 seconds cuz you're like oh I can't do that because of this So Bach plays knight5 now now hikaro a well-timed F6 take take now the Knight has to get out now Karo just gets out with his Knight and he's just ready to push Rook C5 his King gets off the back Rank and he never dips below 40 seconds his opponent is down to two seconds he converts this endgame gets a totally winning position Rook H1 F5 and I think hikaro just wins this game with a very clean King D7 creating kind of a blockade here for the pawn and he just wins and again it he makes it look so easy against these really really really good players now he then went on to to farm some people like 30 to nothing he he he played somebody who had a great username by the way donkey donkey donkey which is just a hilarious username now I'm very curious about this person's username why they decided to include an e in the word donkey in the last donkey but not the other two I don't know fascinating stuff you know chess is a complicated game chess usernames are also complicated it's a very talented player who I guess is from Turkey uh but um I don't know hikaro because you can just set your flag to anything you want but I think that's a Turkish player hikaro in this game playing an alakin okay like I said hearo has to win every game he has a 390 Point Advantage by rating if he wins this game he only gains one point one if he loses this game he loses 14 points think about that you can beat somebody 14 times and then you lose to them once and you lose all your rating that's insane that's why it's so unbelievably impressive to get to that rating so he's playing an alakin right and like I said he car one of the best players in the world in close positions right look at this this close position now we play F6 we try to open it up a little bit still very close seven pawns each pretty symmetrical Rook E8 Bishop E6 right Queen D7 G5 all right so far white is doing a great job keeping up with Hikaru but hikaro is slowly moving that pawn blob forward Knight E5 his young opponent tries to put a knight into the center trade Here Comes hearo activating the knight from the edge of the board getting the bishop pair and then activating his position with D4 and C5 immediately transitioning to a more kind of open game feel little bit more of an open game style all right D4 and C5 both players bring their Rooks we have take take now white in this game clearly doing a nice job keeping up with hikaro on the clock all right not intimidated uh obviously hikaro has stuff to work with here but white is doing very well Queen B4 hi Caro plays Bishop f8 but now's that part of the game where you start feeling those nerves right white plays Queen F5 you're like oh my God I'm playing hikaro and I'm even like what what can I possibly what can possibly go wrong Queen F7 in this position right targeting that pawn on A2 White's got a few ways of Defending it he starts getting tactical plays Bishop to A4 rookie Rook E7 and now what white should have done here is white should have kept it pretty simple instead white plays this move Knight E3 and tries to get a little bit tactical with Hikaru now Hikaru can play Bishop A2 but you can't take the Knight because of the pin so what Hikaru does is he builds off his previous move and takes the file and now black is slightly better because there is some nagging pressure on the white position and the A2 Pawn is hanging I don't know why hikaro didn't take on A2 maybe he didn't like some of the weakening that might happen in his position but here's the risk you run if you play a little bit too quickly against hikaro because he put so much pressure against you on the clock Bishop to B3 looks like there's a pin here hikaro plays Bishop B4 looks like there's a you know you're going to trade and there's a pin there but you know what happens in this position white played Rook F1 White's Rook was hanging so why could play Rook here Rook here Rook here looks a lot smarter because you keep your Rook protected but actually it would have been better to go here you know why because in this position all hikaro has to do is this oops oops your knight is hanging this is now protected and your knight is trapped with your previous move you actually took away your Escape Square so Rook F1 and that's the end of the game now what's interesting look at how much time white spent in the last few moves up until this point it was very even on time within 10 seconds why proceeded to spend 18 seconds this is what Hikaru does to people he gets you in a bit of a trance 18 seconds on this move but should be four another 12 so now you're down 20 seconds on the clock and you're like all right I got to react quickly you play this move in 1.7 seconds hikaro finds this move in two seconds two seconds Retreat the bishop and protect the rook and the game is over you just lose just like that it's over now this donkey dude actually managed to beat hikaro like once maybe or two times but hikaro won a lot of those games hikaro also played a fet master from you know the rest of the planet uh this person was rated around 3,000 this one hikaro played a grunfeld opening the position we saw a very similar type of structure in the bot game like this black will obviously rely on C5 and queen A5 so hikaro likes to play all sorts of different openings but sometimes he does go for main lines and kind of open positions um Knight takes D7 Bishop D5 the Knight comes here but you'll notice look at the clock from the opening he car chops everything down has some pressure on the center slightly better position and 25 seconds of time Advantage okay so we play a Mainline opening right C5 Queen A5 White playing kind of normal stuff Bishop G4 Karo trying to play a very provocative style that Rook move attacks the pawn he backs his Queen all the way up and now Knight E5 and traditional wisdom tells you that this is definitely a better position for uh for white but here white spends a lot of time and plays the wrong move um after Knight to E5 and castles white could have continued to push for an advantage with this move D5 and again if Hikaru is playing in a provocative way and you know 20 moves of theory you might get an opening Advantage but then he's going to defend really well and you have to beat Hikaru about seven times in one chess game to actually get him to resign like beating Hikaru was borderline impossible um but in this game white relieves the pressure a little bit early and when the dust settles is in a slightly worse position so hikaro plays Queen D7 looking to attack the pawn white plays Queen B4 with the intention of striking both of blacks pawns all right we have B6 Rook E1 iaro takes on D5 and so the idea is quite straightforward if you take this I'm going to take on D4 if you wait to defend D4 I'm going to play E6 so Bishop E5 E6 and hear is just to clean Pawn up and 20 seconds right as always that comfortable Edge of Time white plays A4 cuz he's down a pawn but he's trying to trade a little bit hikaro brings The Rook very powerful trying to win that pawn in the center white white now gets desperate and plays H4 so the sure sign of a desperate player is when they just start lashing out with you with A and H pawns because they don't know what else they could possibly do now hikaro is a moment away from being up two pawns he's up one now this one might fall and now hekar plays Rook C8 with the intention of putting a rook right on the C4 Square he continues to be attacked by his opponent and he defends this position absolutely flawlessly he plays F6 and his opponent Falls for a trap if his opponent backs out of the position he's going to end up winning this pawn and probably that one as well and win the end game his opponent tries to strike and Counterattack Hikaru which is just about one of the worst things you can do because he is one of the most brutal counter punchers in chess your Bishop is hanging you Counterattack karo's Bishop your idea is that if he takes you take his Pawn but he goes here 20 second time Advantage check hits your queen hits your bishop and now you have to resign and again we we we left the opening stage about nine moves ago and just how easily like if you're not perfect he will simplify everything that he makes it look so simple you look at a game like this you're like I can play like this I'm not saying you and hikaro are the same level I'm just saying you look at this like every move that he's making and Lev's explaining kind of makes sense it's not like that complicated but in your games it's so much harder now after that hikaro played somebody named chess Brainiac and he played chess Brainiac quite a few times uh and uh chess Brainiac I think probably still streams he's a he's a I believe he's a title player like 2,800 Blitz and I think Hikaru beat him something like 70 games in a row I mean it was it was unbelievable how much patience chess Brainiac had uh this is the game this is ultimately the the game that uh that Crown hikaro the the the 35 405 and um again he has to beat chess Brainiac 14 times to not lose one game to even out which is so unbelievable now you will remember that first game Arun here we go D5 very similar structure remember in that game we had H5 against F4 this time we have A6 Bishop D3 and now we have a look at the structure by hikaro I mean you talk about you talk about a goofy opening position right he just puts every Pawn on a light Square I mean th this this looks like you're playing a little sibling and you deliberately try to give them odds you're like I don't want my little sibling to feel bad if I get a good position so every Pawn is going to be on a light Square now of course Black's two main Pawn breaks in these positions are F6 and C5 right so the pawn goes to F4 and now Hikaru plays C5 right away so Hikaru trying to Target the center where white does not have sufficient defenses if white plays Knight E2 he's going to get his is is is piece trapped but now Karo has one piece out and he has seven pawns on light squares which means his light squared Bishop is pretty bad but it can go out this way and trade and his dark squar Bishop is actually really good so white no longer can claim any advantage from the opening he just chooses to develop black also develops and now white can't Castle because of how strong he Caro's Bishop is so we play Queen E2 all right hikaro plays Knight C6 white plays Bishop D2 Bishop d uh first hikaro plays B5 because he can tell his opponent wants the castle along White says you know what I got no better way to Castle and Bishop D7 King B1 now will hearo Castle probably not because it gives White's position a little bit of hope so rather than castling what hikaro does now is just launches an attack straight away from this position by playing the move B4 which to me looks like it doesn't make a whole lot of sense because the Knight is just going to go there block the pawns and hit the bishop clearly that didn't make sense to his opponent either but now Karu strikes in the center with Knight D4 counterattacking hitting the queen and threatening to take that Knight his idea is to take the Knight it's not to take the the the Knight back in the center unless this happens and now that Knight is trapped so that was hikaru's whole idea so out of nowhere suddenly hikaru's got good attacking chances and he brings this bishop back to B5 to trade it not just to trade it because it's his bad Bishop but because he can open the a file to launch an Unstoppable devastating attack and this is so well timed It's So Sophisticated Bishop to B5 white walked himself into a little bit of a pin so now he can't get rid of the SL squ Bishop so easily he goes Bishop E3 but remember hikaru's idea is founded on positional play as well so we have Queen B6 now white does the best thing he can do here which is try to launch an attack technically it was even stronger for white to play F5 which is really fascinating and the idea of F5 is sacrificing the Knight Fe Bishop C5 and if you can't take obviously it's protected right so F5 take Knight E6 and if you play Bishop E3 like this I have Knight G7 check and if King here I have Rook E3 and if King G7 I have Rook G3 check winning the queen so the queen would have to block crazy absolutely crazy but again you have to see all of that instead white plays G4 Hikaru will lashes out with H5 but white plays F5 very complicated game HG Fe opening up hikaru's Queen and BR bringing the queen into the F6 square but hikaro was up 50 seconds so white played the best way possible white is trying to create the most powerful Counterattack possible but Hikaru is up 50 seconds it's costing white the thing about Blitz is it's you can play well but you have to play efficiently and if you're not playing efficiently you're getting yourself into a dangerous position right so Hikaru plays King D7 and now White's got a minute he's feeling that pressure so he goes for a tactic hearo is the best counter puncher in the game if you take on E6 he'll take your Bishop that's what he that that was the idea but if you take like this the move Rook takes D5 does not work if this queen F7 check e CaRu walks the king out of danger there is absolutely nothing here and he is the most brutal counter puncher in the game all of these threats hearu doesn't wait for defense he plays Knight C3 a dagger of a move The Rook is hanging and if you move the king of course you're just down 97 points of material and you're going to lose white has no checks but if you take you get M it on B2 so Hikaru the Knight that comes to guard the king ultimately is the dagger in the heart and Hikaru gets to 345 174 games he played 159 wins 12 draws and three defeats I can't even fathom that like that is that is so sick that is so crazy I don't know if we will see 3405 again in the future Magnus and hikaro are constantly competing for like the top spot maybe we'll see Magnus get 3405 these players are so ridiculously good it is unbelievable uh and I just wanted to share this with all of you so yeah now we can all feel bad about our chess together get out of here
