- All right, Jake Paulers, raise your right hand. Put that right hand on the car. - Can I use my left hand? - I mean, sure. Rules are simple. Last one of your right
hands, his left hand, to leave the car, keeps it. - This car? - It's a different Lamborghini, but yes, you get a Lamborghini. - Sweet.
- Okay. - All right, Chris, I'm
gonna need your phone. - All right. - No phones. We gotta make this hard. Garrett, I'm gonna need yours. Thank you for your phone. No phones. This gonna be a hard challenge. Just to clarify, Chris, that is your right hand. - Yep. - Put your left hand on the car too. Just because your left hand's on the car does not mean you can take
your right hand off the car. It's only your specific hand. - So this counts?
- Yes. - This counts?
- Yes. - This does not count? - He took his hand off! See ya, bye. - All right, we have officially started. Any questions? - Can I throw my poop this time? - Um, sure, actually. Go ahead. We will get you poop buckets. We just started, you
don't need 'em right now. - See my hater blockers? - Chandler?
- Yes. - Who do you think will win? - Chandler. - Really?
- Chandler. - Okay. Jake, who do you think will win? - J-Train. - Chris, who do you think will win? - All of us cause we have Jesus. - Chris, who will actually win? - Me. - Garrett, who do you think will win? - We're all winners. - Well, you can't all win. Only one of you gets the Lamborghini. - As long as we all have
fun, we're all winners. - No. Three of you will
get literally nothing. And one of you will get a really nice car. - Let's all have fun
- Are you having fun? - I'm having fun. - Yeah. You know what would be more fun? Driving around in a Lamborghini. So leave that hand on that car. - Do y'all smell a hot pocket? - All right, one last thing. Chandler, can we talk to your dad? I wanna know if Bobby's
still on the knee scooter. - Hello? - Hey, Chandler's dad. It's me, Jimmy. We just started the hand
on the car challenge. Is there any words of wisdom you want to give Chandler this time? - Dude, I thought you were calling to tell me he won. - Nope. Well, we just started, literally, five minutes ago. If he wins, he gets a $20,000+ car. - He better win this one, man. He knows cause I'm getting
his car if he gets that one. - Yeah. - Also, the world wants to know, does Bobby still on a knee scooter? - Probably so. - Darn. All right, can
you keep us updated? Let us know when he's not. I will make Chandler call
you if he's about to quit. I want you to really motivate him. I really want Chandler to win. - You and me both, Jimmy. - All right. - You tell him to call me if he's about to quit. - Will do. All right, I'll let you know. Bye. - He and brother Bobby will be proud. - He's on a knee scooter. - Jake, you weren't here
for the last challenge. What do you think about this challenge? - It's going great. We're already like two hours in. I'm feeling good. - Jake, It's been actually five minutes. - Oh God. - Also, I can't see that hand mister. Keep the hand visible. Hey Garrett, if you quit right
now, you can go on Tinder. - No, I'm good. - I want to win because I
want to buy my wife a car. I'm gonna sell the Lamborghini and buy my wife a car with it. As you know, last video, I
quit the challenge for her. This time I'm completing it for her. - Oh my, I'm running away. - Jake just let loose the worst fart. - Someone else to talking, Jake's like, "How can I steal this car?" - All right guys, it's Garrett here. I just want a Lambo. Nothing too much. - Hello- - Why don't you pre-game
interview over here? Come on. - I've made my way to the
front of the Lamborghini. I'm squatting down cause I'm tall. I wanna win because I need a car. - You wanna win cause you need a car? - Yes.
- All right. Then don't take that hand
off and you can have a car. Jake, why do you wanna win? - It's my first competition. Trying to go one for one. - Okay. Do you need a car?
- No. I just wanna beat them. - Okay, you just don't
want them to have a car? - Exactly. Sole purpose is to beat them. - Gotcha.
- That's it. - Sir, is that hand on the car? I'm just making sure.
Keep that hand there. Last rule that we didn't
mention, you have to be standing. If you're sitting, you're out. - What book you're reading, Jake? - Reading the instructions of my tripod. - Hey, no entertainment. You guys must suffer. Chandler, that's pretty dangerous, man. - I'm very flexible. You can see my hand, correct? - Yeah, I can. I'm just saying man, one wrong move and that hand's not there. - I have a rope now.
- No rope. - Hey, that hand almost came off. - No, it didn't.
- I saw a gap. I saw a gap. - No, hey. No rope. Ropes are entertaining.
You guys must suffer. It's been recording for 30 minutes, boys. - 30 minutes? Let's get it, dude. - Hey, one final question. Who do you think will quit first? - Chris.
- Chris. - Who do you think will quit first, Chris? - Chandler. - Who do you think, Garrett? Chris? Chris? Three people think Chris.
Chris thinks Chandler. - Hey, Jimmy, let me ask you something. - Yeah.
- Who do you think will quit? - Yeah, I can. - Honestly, Chris. - Hey, I'm blocking Chris right here. - I think Chris will
probably be the first. All right, let's play a game. Everyone, let's play 'Simon Says.' Simon says, "Raise your
hand not on the car." Simon says, "Put your right foot up." Take your right arm up. Ah, you guys are no fun. - You still lost cause he
didn't say 'Simon Says'. - Ah, you lost. - Whoever wins outta you guys is gonna be a flex master. You're gonna have a Lambo. - I'm freaking out a little bit. - Why? - I don't know, I feel constricted. - You told me you were gonna win. Do not let brother Bobby down. - I feel like I can't move. - You can't. - I wanna go over to Jake's quadrant. Do I have permission to pass under you? - Chandler, let Chris pass through. - Ow, I stubbed my finger. - I'm gonna go over to this area. - Keep that hand on the car. - Hey Jake, I'm in your quadrant. - What's going on? - What's going on, man? - How goes it?
- It's going great. Teamwork right here is
making the dream work. - Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa. - This is uncomfortable. - What's going on over there? - He's leaning against me. - Jake, how long are you willing to hold your hand on that? - Probably eight to 10 hours. - That's it? All right, how long are you willing to keep your hand on this car? - However long it takes. - Garrett, how long are you willing to keep your hand on this car? - Infinity. - Chandler, how long are you gonna keep your hand on this car? - Well, I gotta get past my whining stage. So after that I'll let you know. - Okay. Children, I'm gonna go use
the bathroom real quick. - What?
- Any of you guys wanna come use the bathroom with me? - I already pooped today. - Can I get some aqua? - I pooped about two minutes ago. - Yeah, we'll get you some aqua. I'm gonna go poop. I'll be right back. Don't leave. We got
that camera on you guys. - All right. All right. - All right?
- All right. - All right.
- All right. - All right
- Good night. - All right.
- Good night. - I'm gonna go.

- Bye. - Bye.
- Bye. - Get him. Get him. Let's get him. Do I have permission to kiss you? - No. - Gimme permission to kiss you. - No. - Block party, block party. - Tag, you're it. Oh, oh, oh, oh, wait. - My hand was on the car, dude. - I saw a hand pop off. - Don't listen to him. Is it on camera? My hand didn't pop off. - I saw a hand pop off. - I went underneath Jake's hand. - Chandler, we're an hour and a half in. - You sure it hasn't been three days? - We're an hour and a half in. - I'm super bored. This is the most boring
thing I've ever done. It's like going to the DMV. - Are you still gonna win though? - Yeah, I'm still gonna win. - Hour and a half in. - I know. - Hour and a half in. - It only feels like it's
been like 10 minutes. Besides my head's so low. ♪ The itsy bitsy spider ♪ - I didn't get consent. - I give you consent. - Consent is important,
ladies and gentlemen. - Look, look, look, I'm crushing his head. Hello. - You're pressed up against my genitals. - All right, here, let's squish your head. You wanna come over- - This is so tiring. - I feel like a squirrel. - Chandler, what's your hand doing? - It does not wanna be on the car anymore. Calm down, hand. - There there, buddy. - Your hand needs a
darn knee scooter, bro. - Oh my God, It's like twitching. - It can twitch all it wants as long as it stays on the car. - Calm down buddy. - 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63. - If one of them counts to 100,000, can they just win? - Yes. - If one of you come to 100,000, you win. - 80.
- It takes 50 hours. They won't do it. - You can't do that. - You can't lean on the car. That's a warning.
- Stop! - That's a warning.
- Stop leaning! - Stop leaning!
- Stop leaning! - Leaning! Leaning!
- Warning! Warning! Warning! Warning! Warning! Warning! Warning! - Do I have your consent? - To do what? - To stand right here? - I guess so. - All right, I'm gonna stand right here. Now for a live interview
with Chris and Chandler. Chandler, how do you

- It sucks. - No, one's making you
keep your hand there. - I'm gonna win. - Okay, cool. - I just like complaining. - Two and a half hours in. - I'm not doing too bad.
I'm kinda tired though. This is boring. Chewing on a piece of rubber band. - I mean, if you're bored, just take your hand off. And be unbored. - Watch your hand there? - Huh?
- No. - Okay. Chandler, is that your pee? - Yes, it. - All right, Chandler, gimme your pee. Where should I go empty it. - I mean. Oh hell, no, I'm not drinking that.

my hand back on the car. That's not what I just did. - You had your hand off. - No, what? - Why'd you take your hand off? - Because. - Take it off, you're out. You took it off. - I had a mess up and they caught me. - And there you go. You three are all that remains. No car for Garrett. One of you three, Chandler, Jake, Chris, one of you three will get a Lamborghini. Which one will it be? - It's probably not gonna be me. - I don't know at this point. - Oh, really.

- Yeah, I know. I was about to take my pants off too. You wanna quit? What did you just say? - I want to. - Okay. - I know you ain't quit already. - Well, this is me. I'm not near Chandler, but Chandler just told me
he's thinking about quitting. What do you want me to say to him? - Oh my God. - Chandler, your dad wants
to say something to you. Just to give you an update, Garrett quit. So it's only Chandler, Jake, and Chris. - Well, you know, Chris is going next. - Yes. - Chandler, you can do this, man. Don't think about your
arm, think about your feet. - My feet hurt. - Then think about your eyelashes. Boy, they don't hurt. - My eyelashes, I can't feel my eyelashes. - That's what I'm saying. - Dude, you give buy
brother Bobby a new leg if you win.
- He needs a new leg. - Dude, think of brother
Bobby's poor self. - He needs a new knee scooter. - Yeah. All right, Garrett. Are you staying in? - I'm Chandler. - Chandler, you staying in? - Yeah, I'ma stay in.
- You are? - This is Chris. Sometimes I feel like quitting. What should I do? - Chris, walk away, bro. You don't need no car like that. You be drawing attention
to you and your wife. - I think that's the pep talk he needed. I'll call you if he is
about to quit again. - All right, good man. - All right, bye. All guys, we're gonna move the Lamborghini out of the garage, okay? Me and Chris are in the
garage with our Lamborghini. - You know how we got this Lamborghini? - Knowledge. - And blinds. Lots of blinds. Whoa. Weird flex, but okay. Keep your hands on the car. Whoa.
- Whoa. - Watch, your hands.
- It can do tricks. - No, no. You scared me. No! - You take your hand off. You took your hands off. - No! - Yay. You me. - Are you kidding me?
- Yay. - Dude, he made me think my
hand's about to get crushed. My dad's gonna be so disappointed. - Oh my gosh, I forgot about your dad. Let's call him. - Oh no! - Dude, your dad's gonna kill you. - Hey man. - Hey, look at Chandler's hands. - Oh no boy. - Yeah.
- Dude, so we were bringing the
car out of the garage and they're putting
the top up and he goes, "Move your hand." And I just jerked. - You fell for that? - I got scared. No, he actually put the
top up and I got scared. I thought it was gonna crush my hand and- - Oh my God, you could get another hand. - Your dad- - He's so mad, he hung up. - We live in a town where they got really
good hospitals, right? - Yeah, it was instinct. I'm sorry. - Well, you don't have a car anymore 'cause I'm taking yours, man. - Oh, really? I'll just walk to work.
- Now you're outta luck. You can drive Brother Bobby's scooter. You're still a good boy. - All right, man. - Good Luck you two guys. - Yep. He said good luck, Chris. - Bye, Chandler's dad. - Thanks man. Bye.
- See you, brother. - Man, not only did 10 million people just watch him move his hand off, but then he just got-
- Roasted. - By his dad. - Ah, I really can't believe I did that. - All right, it's down to Jake and Chris. - Me and the Viking. - Come on, man. We're watching Gumball. - Told you I wasn't gonna be first out. - And it's just you and Jake now competing for Lambo, what do you have to say? - I'm an Instagram girl, hold on. Ah. - Okay, Miss Instagram girl. - My daddy bought it for me. - Your wife still needs a car, correct? She didn't get one in the last four hours. - She has not got a car
in the last four hours, so she needs one. - So you're not gonna
take that hand off then. - No, this hand is glued to it. - All right.
- I'm butter and that's glue and it's gonna stick to it and stick to you. - The dilemma here is Jake also wants a new car and Jake's hand still there. Your wife needs a car. Your self needs a car. Don't let yourself down. Don't let your wife down. Here you go, Chris. Here's your meal. Jake, here are your rations. These will hold you over
to the morning. Enjoy. - And we're just sitting
there eating and talking and a fly comes up to his face and he just goes, whoosh, and that camera caught it. - Dude, I go to eat food for
five minutes and Jake loses. - I'm very upset with
myself at this moment. - Jake. - I looked at him and I was like, "Jake, you just swatted a fly." - I was eating like this. And like I saw a fly, I was just like, and then I was like. - Jake, a Lamborghini because of a fly. You lost it. All right, Jake Paulers, as you can see, no one else is touching the car but Chris, which means Chris is the winner. Chris-
- I'm the winner. - You did not win this Lamborghini. You won a Lamborghini. - And I'm excited about
that just the same. - All right, take your hand off the car. - My hand is actually really
tight and really dirty. - All right, so we're on the computer looking for used Lamborghinis. To be straightforward, we were gonna give Chris
a Lamborghini from 1999. It was about $23,000. But Chris said he wasn't
interested in the car and he wanted to do
something else instead. So what did you wanna do? - So instead of getting the Lamborghini, I wanted to take the 20 grand and split it between the
other guys in the video who lost, cause, you know, it's kind of unfair how they lost and we're a family here. We look after you each other. - You could get a 1999
Lamborghini worth 20 grand, but instead you just want the 20 grand and you wanna split it with them. - Yes. - So you could have 20 grand. - I could.
- But you only want five and you want
the rest of them to get five. - That is correct. There will be no exposed video from me. - Ah! Well, thank you. - Yeah, man.
- Now I don't have to pay my employees. Everyone comment what you would do if Chris randomly gave you five grand. Jake, you took a fat L.
- L. - Chris has something
he wants to say to you. The winner of the challenge. - We are gonna be splitting it four ways. The other guys don't know yet so. - Are you serious? - Yeah. It's only fair, man. - Is this a joke?
- Nah. - It was his decision. I'm not making him.
- Really? - Yeah dude, it's only fair, bro. You gotta look out for the homies, bro. Ah, pick me up. I wanna be picked up. You're so much larger. Yay. - But for real, like, this is for real. - Yeah. This is for real. - Ah, yes. - Chris, you're stupid. - I know.
- I'm not a loser. - Yeah, you're still a loser, but you're just a slightly richer loser. - You're a loser, but
you're not a poor loser. - You're so sweet.
- Yay. - Yay.
- All right, let's get the other people, one at a time. - All right, Garrett, you know why we called you here? - No. - Chris has something
and wants to tell you. You know how you took a fat
L on the Lamborghini video? - Yeah. - Instead of like me getting the lump sum, I'm just gonna split it four ways. Me, you, Jake, and Chandler were all gonna just split it four ways. - Oh, that's pretty nice. So how much am I getting? - Like 4,500.
- We talking what? 4,500?
- Yeah. - Are you serious?
- Yeah. - Can you like jump over this table and gimme a hug? Oh!
- It's not- - Thank you.
- Hey, this is my child. - Yeah, it's the night after Halloween. He got little. Tell 'em, Garrett, what are you gonna buy with
the $4,500 you just won? I'm gonna buy a four-wheeler. - A four Wheeler.
- No way, that's a good purchase. - Chandler, you get Lamborghini video. You know how you didn't win? - Yeah. - So instead of taking lump sum, big sum of money, we're just gonna split it all four ways. Each gonna get like 4,500. - No way. - Yeah.
- Really? - Yeah. - You're so nice. - Nah, I'm not. - Chance, what you buying with 4,500. - Some food right now. - Okay. After that food, what are you buying with the $4,490. - My car is really about to blow up. - Sounds like Chris just hooked you up. - Yes, indeed. - Ha, I just made you guys hug. - Yep, this is great. ♪ This job is done ♪ ♪ Mister Beast ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ Mister Beast ♪ ♪ Oh ♪
