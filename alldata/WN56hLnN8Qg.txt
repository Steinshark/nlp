one of the great things that modern Scholars are perplexed by is why does everyone have a dragon like there's not a single human culture anywhere in the world that doesn't have a dragon including people who live in places that don't have snakes this is Jonathan Pedro welcome to the symbolic [Applause] world so hello everyone we are back with Richard Roland for another Universal history episode and this week we are going to talk about dragons which I'm sure is going to be of interest to everybody uh that I know around the symbolic world so Richard go I know so many people have been asking for this for so long that's right and so we already had a little bit of the Dragon discussion in the baywolf course that we've talked about uh quite a bit and so you could check that out for sure but uh we'll see when Jonathan says a little bit what he means is that we actually talked about dragons for about seven hours so so I just really want to like make sure that that we we I wna I want to properly sell you on the baywolf class if you haven't already signed up for that bought that I know it's a little pricey but it's literally uh like 20 something hours of Jonathan and I talking about baywolf like total you know and along with handouts and everything else and and we literally spent at least seven hours talking about the dragon between the last two classes that's right and uh if you want to know the secret connection between the dragon and the grindel kin for instance it's not what Neil Gaiman thinks it is um but if you want to know what it is and there is a secret connection then uh sign up for that class and a lot of the things that we're going to say say about dragons today we cover in significantly more depth in the class so what I really want to happen over the course of the next few years is is to do some more of these kinds of classes where I get to go really deep on things that I'm trying to summarize in 45 minutes and you know the really frustrating thing about making these videos Jonathan is that we'll record something and then later on I'll think oh I said that wrong I need to go back and you know so like when we do the the the coursework not only do we get to go deeper and you know we got uh 18 to 20 hours instead of one hour right for a subject but also I get to like do a lot more in the in terms of like research footnotes editing and also you get all of my like presentation like slides of notes and stuff like that for those classes so the b class was the first one I hope we have some more to introduce next year oh yeah I for sure Dante the comedy is going to probably be the next one we're going to do cuz I'm excited about doing that as well so I think that that will be the next one and then we'll see from there on so Richard how are you going to start us off with dragons like we don't even know where to start so I should have expected this given that they're dragons you know but uh they they they turn out to be very difficult to uh pin down as it were um it [Music] were in 2021 my brother met you and I with the help of cor neelsen of Philip Carton and introduce all of you to a New Vision of Storytelling we launched the God's dog monster graphic novel through crowdfunding introducing the dog-headed St Christopher the dragon slang St George into full view as a new epic story began the response was astounding reaching over $250,000 and ultimately selling out our first print of the book now book two of five in this series God's dog Warrior moves into the meet of this epic story where our dog-headed stranger must be integrated must be trained and must fight the cosmic Stakes behind the story become clear the character shine and heart-wrenching choices must be made book two will surprise you with more monsters more Giants and a deeper exploration of the mythology underlying it all since book one of God's dog I've also started a publishing company called symbolic World Press with some amazing Partners to deal with the Timely production Printing and shipping of all future books we've already successfully published Snow White and the Widow Queen and will expand our activities rapidly the money we raise is to build this whole project and even move towards other media we now have three full-time people working with us plus nine artists six writers collaborating towards at least 14 upcoming books and all of this without any outside funding no outside control it's all of you making this possible this is why crowdfunding is so powerful so on this crowdfunding we've partnered with professional comic artist Matt Shen Jesse White Philip ctin and Martin crotz to bring together God's dog Warrior but on top of that I'm also introducing an entirely new comic book series called the garments of skin which will explore the L the mythology around God's dog bring the story Into the Contemporary world where new hero her es tried to resist a global system of control we are at a turning point in culture a turning point in storytelling and I know I can count on all of you to make it possible we have to take back the Reigns of Storytelling move past The Gatekeepers and I thank all of you for trusting us to play a part in that thank you for backing Gods doog Warrior and Kickstarter today there's this great line from a scholar that I was reading um on the the subject of dragons in like an the ancient near East and ancient Indo European Legends which is probably where we'll start and uh she says that you're expecting it to be like oh it's a a thread and I'll start pulling the thread and I'll just be able to chase it from beginning to the end but it's not like that it's like a spider web m and you're looking at all of the threads and you're like well did this come from this or did this come from this and did this come from this and and and it's very difficult to sort of Trace like even nail down what a dragon is because there are certain General things and that's where we're going to start in a second there are certain General things you could say are true about dragons but then there are always exceptions to that so like you could say you know if there's 10 things that make a dragon like all dragons have seven out of 10 of these things right different seven out of 10 but but then um but then there are various dragons that are like little weird exceptions to these rules and I think that this is going to go a lot towards uh the way that we think about the dragon as as a monster right as a monster as very often something of a shape shifter right uh something that's got the ability capacity to kind of change its shape and actually takes on different roles in different societies and then maybe what that means for us again you know as as always I'm coming at this from the perspective of a Christian who um you know and and and so for us as as Christians the idea of a serpent or a dragon means something in particular although it also means other things that maybe most people haven't thought about so we'll get into that no for sure that's been the way that I would approach it mostly you know for those who have read I've read a few articles about it I wrote an article called the dragons that almost exist where I discussed the the the relationship between the dragon and the monster and that it seemed to be the key in in in you know the idea of something which is not fully identified is exactly what a dragon is and so because of that it has that shapes shifting quality yeah yeah so the let me just go over some things that all dragons or let's most dragons seem to have in common right the first is that a dragon is a serpent now when I say a dragon is a serpent I mean the the word Dragon itself probably comes from a very old like early Latin word which means just a serpent right or from sorry from a Greek word that means just a serpent and um it's got It's from a Proto IND European Ute root word which has to do with uh the glance right uh like the like the idea of like a piercing glance or a deadly glance right that's the that's the root of that word and um and of course there are there even to this day there are plenty of dragon-like creatures right dragons or dragon-like creatures whose gaze is one of the most deadly things things about them right the Basilisk for instance and so on now something to say here is that we have to be really careful about when we're going back and looking at dragons um for our purposes we're not going to really we're not you have to be really careful about not treating them as like different species right there's a kind of like a modern tendency that has its you know as its apoy like the the the D D and D monster manual right where it's like you've got all these different kinds of dragons and then these other kinds of like Dragon Light creatures and they're all sort of different a different species with a different stat block and a different you know and uh so that sometimes if you if you come at this stuff from that modern perspective you end up getting a little tripped up on things that that really would just not have been a difficult thing for somebody in the ancient world uh so for instance if you look at a a Persian Dragon right if you look at artwork of a Persian Dragon it looks exactly like a Chinese dragon yeah yeah now if you're coming at this from a modern perspective you'd say well the Persians had one word for dragons and the Chinese had this other word that we translate as dragon and so are they really the same creature but you can just look at the artwork like contemporary Persian Chinese artwork and say yeah it's definitely the same same creature like no Chinese person traveling in Persia which is a thing that happened by the way uh no Chinese person traveling in Persia in the Iron Age would have looked at a picture of a of a Persian dragon and said oh I don't know that is just it's not it's not how it goes so most dragons seem to be composite creatures now I I said that all dragons are serpents right or at least most dragons are serpent actually most dragons seem to be composite creatures but one the main ingredient is always serpent put it that way right well that's because by the way that's important to to to state because first of all that's what makes it a monster right a monster is a hybrid because it doesn't have a category attributed only to itself so when you you look at a hybrid or when you look at a monster what you're seeing is things that in your estimation don't have are taken from other places and are stuck together into one thing that's actually an experience of hybridity in general it's not just related to monsters it can help us understand what monsters are but that is also what a snake is a snake is a being that can be in two places at once it's one of the only ones right because it it does this yeah yeah yeah and it's a and it's a it's a being that also transforms itself by shedding its outer appearance and kind of reconstituting its its outer appearance so the idea of the of the snake that sheds its skin means that there's a relationship between hybridity monstrosity and change because change is exactly when something loses its identity especially kind transformational change loses its identity and then is in the process of becoming something else and in that middle space between the what it used to be and what it's becoming now there's a kind of fluidity that that that appears and that is what accounts for monsters that's why we used to say that the word monster means a sign right it's a it's a sign that something that thing yeah something's happening like that that things are not going to be the same anymore and that's what the sign of hybridity uh reveals to us and this is precisely why it's so difficult to talk about a dragon or even to trace like one of the great things that modern Scholars are perplexed by is why does everyone have a dragon like there's not a single human culture anywhere in the world that has a that doesn't have a dragon including people who live in places that don't have snakes right and and so it's one of these things where people are always trying to sort of answer the question like why does everybody have a dragon and yeah the dragons they're all a little bit different depending on where you live if you live near the water maybe it's a sea serpent or like a sea dragon kind of a thing right but but you know if you live you know so so what's going on there and so modern Scholars have these a bu of f different theories for this say oh well it's dinosaur bones now to be completely every time before the 19th century anybody ever dug up dinosaur bones which happened all the time for instance lots of dinosaur bones in China when people dug up dinosaur bones in China what did they call them Dragon they said these are dragon bones of course and in fact that dragon bone like powdered dragon bone is an important element uh uh uh uh ingredient in traditional Chinese medicine you know it's just like fossilized dinosaur bones right um uh dragon bones and uh same thing same thing in the British Isles same thing in in anywhere that somebody's dug up dragon uh dinosaur bones they've said oh these obviously you know that's true I know I know I'm trying to I'm trying to bring people along with us Jonathan trying to accommodate for the the modern world I I understand yeah I'm trying to bring people along with us um it's actually yeah it's much easier just to say they're dragon bones right so um and actually what's really fun is that uh all of these uh like the some of the more recent reconstructions of what these various different uh uh dinosaurs might have actually looked like they're like well maybe they had feathers and maybe they had this maybe they had this and they start they keep looking more and more like dragons and I'm like just waiting I'm just waiting for somebody to notice you know that's right it's that is actually I noticed that too I thought you know they used to make fun of the medievals for their dragon category and now you look at a medieval manuscript and you look at modern reconstructions and you're like ah they got it better than a lot of the you know early 20th century gray like those gray lizards that they that they that they did yeah uh okay so anyway all this to say uh I just want to say one thing about the Dragon Balls actually so this is important this is important to understanding in a meta way is that the fact that the dragon manifests itself as a residue of something which is forgotten is also part of what a dragon is manifesting like an ancient world that we know longer have access to and that is and is kind of manifesting itself as a kind of chaos broken residue a remainder of an ancient world these are all the types of symbolism that we need to gather together when we think of what a dragon is there's a um uh one one of my other favorite theories from Modern Scholars about this you know people who like to think of things in predominantly like evolutionary terms this is the Jordan Peterson strategy is the idea that um the idea that well maybe it's because we're descended from monkeys and the monkeys were afraid of snakes and so now we're afraid of like I don't know just like goofy goofy stuff you know this is really Jordan's Jordan's Theory like is that that that that that it's a in some ways our fear of snakes uh is a predetermined thing like it's not something learned it's actually biologically inscribed in us and so and so that's why we have a mythological image of a snake that keeps manifesting itself so the the Big Challenge to this is uh is that of course many people are not afraid of snakes uh a lot of people like them uh but also like not every like not everybody is afraid of dragons either like we'll we'll get to that right uh different cultures have kind of different ways of encountering or dealing with Dragons so like I I don't know uh yeah I I'm I'm not totally I'm not totally Satisfied by that theory for lots of reasons I guess let me let me give the devilit do as Jordan himself say yeah is that he said that the the relationship between the snake is not just a fear it's fear and Fascination it has to be both because when the ape sees the snake it will be afraid of it but it will stare at it like it'll stare at it for like hours because it's trying to figure out what's going on and so this relationship between fear and Fascination is one that that he talks about but the thing is that let's say how can I say this the best description of a dragon like the best discussion about dragon has to do with our experience of of the category rather than the mechanical description right of how it mechanically came about no whatever that is like we're not apes and we don't have to deal with we don't live in trees and we don't have to deal with snakes and so the idea that you would tell me that that's the origin of this it's like that doesn't mean anything it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't enter into my categories of meaning it doesn't enter into the fact that that you know a child will will will draw a snake like that a that some something there's something primordial about and that it happens in every culture like that's a there's are better ways to approach that and I think the universal history approach is a better one that to make sense of it so yeah there you go yeah that that was good and I appreciate you explaining that side of things to me a little more because um actually I don't know if you've ever seen like a weasel or a ferret hunt a a rabbit or or some kind of a rodent but they actually do like sort of like a little dance that hypnotizes the the the rabbit where the rabbit's like fascinated can't look away yeah and then the weasel kills it so anyway it's like mgle the snake and mowgly that was a great in the Disney the Disney that was that was a wonderful Insight because it's not in the book but it's like a wonderful it is well it is in the book except that Kai Kai the rock python in the in the book is is mowgli's friend yeah um and so actually in the in the book uh he's in the like the city of the the the bandal log the the monkeys right yeah and this the snake is the one that saves him from the monkeys but he's saves him from the monkeys by basically hypnotizing the monkeys until they basically walk into his Jaws but he's mowgli's friend in the in the books so that's the that's the big difference but anyway I love Roger kitling um okay so let's get back to dragons um uh so dragons are serpents this the first thing we can say about them but that they have this element of hybridity so dragons are very rarely I once say never but they're very rarely just a serpent and in fact if you go and look at mythological carvings we'll talk about some of these these dragons that are killed by Thunder gods in Indo-European and then later in Semitic mythologies ancient neares mythologies but if you go look at iconographic depictions of the serpent the serpent is almost never actually shown uh uh almost so so VRA the the the serpent uh in the um in the rigveda right who is killed by Indra the the sort of the great hero of the Epic um he's he's he's almost never depicted as just a serpent he's usually like a some kind of a serpent human hybrid and that's pretty normal like the the F farther back you go the oldest Dragon myths are usually actually depicting some kind of a serpent human hybrid there's a Persian variant of this where he has uh it's a man but he has three heads and two of the heads are serpent heads um and um you know and then of course you're various like you know human upper body Serpentine lower half or vice versa right you have that as you have that as well so yeah you see that everywhere but it's important to understand though that this manifestation has to be extended for example into the serpent in the garden because a serpent that speaks is already a serpent that's not quite a serpent is already something that is humanlike you could say right uh even if though it doesn't necessarily physically appear that way yeah and and so a lot of times you'll have various dragons or dragon-like creatures which uh we're just going to call dragons for purposes of what we're doing today that will have Serpentine features but then they'll also have uh features from lion or uh very commonly in um uh Chinese dragons which I'm going to blow everybody's mind about in a moment so just stay tuned for that people but Chinese dragons often have the a almost always have antlers like a deer um as a and you know feet like a lion and all these other parts so um and actually there's a lot of traditional accounts and depictions of Chinese and other Asian dragons Far Eastern dragons um there's a lot of symbolism that's you know that they they read a lot of symbolism into the the numbers of the scales or the numbers of the dots on the back of you know and so on so like all of these features are actually very important for understanding uh those creatures and that the dragons in those cultures but uh so the second thing we could say about dragons is that dragons are almost always a guardian of some kind um and the things that dragons traditionally guard or you could say hoard um because hoarding is like the the Dark Side of of guarding something um uh but the things that dragons almost are always guarding or hoarding is water uh in almost every culture and then everything else that you have a dragon hoarding later on Ian famously in Western Europe dragons sit on Treasure right but that's that's because of certain developments a little bit later on which we'll talk about yeah they also kidnap women yes yeah you St George story they so we have to think of it as a kind of hoarding where he takes the virgin and keeps her and then she has to be freed well and but also the the keeping of the woman is associated with so this is the thing they Guard water but if you really think about the significance of guarding water it actually goes back to this idea of the serpent as the guardian of paradise um so if people want to get more into this side of things you can go listen to the Lord of spirits episode on The Serpent and the devil and all that stuff um one of the things they talk about is the the relationship of the serpent in Genesis to the idea of the sarra the sarra which is you know a winged fiery serpent um also a category of Angel right um but the fiery uh the the fiery uh it's a really old word I think it well it's a really old word and the fiery originally has to do with like the the the sting like the the poison the Venom the Venom of the of the serpent um but this idea that this idea that the serpent you know was was supposed to be sort of the Guardian of paradise and then that becomes obviously corrupted uh um but some other places that this manifest just for instance is um well okay so the thing to say about Paradise is that paradise is a place where water comes from right actually first and foremost this is the first thing that we know about Eden yeah is that it has four rivers coming out of it right and so if you think about well how do you have four rivers coming out of it in four different cardinal directions well the only way you can do that is if you're at elevation and there's a spring and then the water's flowing in each direction from the spring right so that's that's what that's what Paradise is right it's a place where water flows from right and so the the idea of of kind of like guarding Paradise or is related to this idea of guarding the water or hoarding the water and so um this this shows up in uh most most famously for instance all the Greek dragons are are water Guardians um so the uh the the the python that Apollo kills uh the uh the Nan Hydra I mean I mean Hydra itself like is just means water right so a Hydra if you're looking at if you're looking at things through like a modern again hate to ragon D and D here but like through that modern D and D lens you're like oh a hyra that's a different creature than a drag no it's it's just a dragon right but this particular dragon has multiple heads and uh but it guards this particular body of water right um and uh but yes all the all the all the biggest uh uh Greek culture Heroes starting with Apollo and orus um are famous for killing monsters but but the like the original Monster you know starting with Apollo and orus is this dragon or the serpent that guards a body of water right and we can think about the importance of water in the ancient world and actually it's still its importance in our world today I it's easy to take for granted because I turn on the tap and the water comes out although actually they had the water shut off to uh for our uh uh to our street earlier this week because they were doing some some repairs to a pipe down the road and um uh that that sense of like turning on the tap and the water doesn't come out and that just like moment of of like really primordial Panic that sits in it's like wait why don't we have water why don't we have water you know and it was all fine it was good and but it's one of those things where uh uh water is so essential it's so completely essential to life right and that uh you know again that's the most important feature we always think of like the garden of the fruit and the trees and everything for obvious reasons but the most important you know feature of paradise is is the fact that this is a source of water this is where the water comes from and this is why the whole the whole idea of the the water coming from the Throne of God in the apocalypse right that's that's what that's about and in St Ephraim and in a lot of the medieval cosmology the idea was in some ways that all the water came from Eden you know like that the the four rivers basically watered the entire world until they ran into the ocean so yeah for people who don't know St Ephraim who is a fourth Century Church Father Syrian poet uh definitely one of my favorite uh uh Church fathers um but he uh he's very clear in his hymns on Paradise and his commentary in Genesis he's very very clear that he doesn't believe that uh Eden is like a terrestrial site it's not on Earth it's sort of above the Earth and you have all the water of the world I mean those four rivers mentioned in Genesis as most people probably know um are are the four Great Rivers of ancient civilization that's that's what's significant about them is like those those four rivers in the in the understanding of the ancient near East like Mesopotamia and Levant those four rivers are the source of of life and civilization in the ancient world so so you've got those four rivers kind of flowing down from Paradise into the terrestrial world yeah um so yeah so dragons usually guard watch over protect bodies of water and they can either do this in a friendly helpful way um so there are such things as I'm not going to say safe dragons but but sometimes helpful or friendly dragons right sometimes you can actually get what you want from a dragon under certain circumstances um but um and uh and then other cases they hoard all of the waters so that nobody gets them um so then the the third thing that we could say about dragons is that they um and there are this is where we start getting into some more exceptions but typically speaking uh the dragon has an enemy and the original enemy the sort of primordial enemy of the Dragon is the bull um the bull or really the Thunder God right who's usually associated with a bull um and I'll give some examples of this uh at this point is probably a good chance to go into them um so uh uh in the in the oldest stories and one of the things that we talked about in the baywolf class is that uh there are um there are Scholars who believe so for instance uh there is a um there's a book by Calbert Watkins called how to kill a dragon um which is a a really deep study in Indo-European Poetics we read from some of it in the baywolf class and I would just say if anybody out there wants to understand what philology is and how it works and what you would use it for and the way that you kind of follow formulas and words as they develop and get reused again over and over again in in stories over a really long period of time that book is a is a really good uh it's a really good introduction to the subject uh but basically what he argues in there is that the uh is that the original story at least for Indo-European languages the original story is hero slay serpent right the hero slays a serpent and the hero in these really old stories is almost always a um either Thunder God or the son of a Thunder God now as as Dragon slang stories kind of um reproduce themselves I don't know how else to say it you know then eventually eventually you know the Thunder God part will kind of will kind of drop out but even then the idea of like a father and son pair or an uncle nephew pair sometimes uh being involved in the slaying of of the Dragon is still kind of the typical the typical pattern of the story so yeah which gets carried by the way all which gets carried all the way into the story of St Michael killing the dragon in a kind of transformed way but this idea that you know some a principality from heaven like a kind of War principality from heaven will it will be the one to finally slay the big dragon yeah yeah so uh let me give some examples real quick from some really old Indo-European stories so for people who don't know indoan languages are uh the languages of with some except ceptions some some some things like that we could asterisk that are not indoan languages but almost every language that you find in India and in um what is now uh Iran like the sort of the Iranian step and then in Europe are Indo-European languages that is they are descended from the same group uh the same family of languages that go kind of go all the way back and there are certain elements of induran society which in places as far apart as Ireland and India yeah develop in the same way because they have the same Roots right and that and that's why so there is kind of a common uh uh language group and and and then because of that a common culture so um one of the earliest Indo-European dragons or serpents that we have is uh I mentioned a moment ago VRA VRA is a dragon or a demon in the form of a dragon um uh who in the rig Veda takes all of the Waters of uh uh of all the rivers in the world hoardes them under a mountain right so this is of course disastrous for the world there's no fresh water no fertile river valleys and this means that the ancient hero Indra who uh uh sorry this means that ancient agrarian societies of the Indian subcontinent would be would have completely collapsed right without water you don't have anything so um he's slain by the hero Indra who slays him with a thunderbolt crafted for him by the craft God of Tash tree I think and um that that name Tash tree is uh has a lot of permutations um it shows up in like hittite stuff for instance also in induran language and uh but in every kind of permutation uh that that that he's the guy usually that makes the Thunderbolt not always but in in most cases let's say um is that the weapon you see in Indian culture like the double Trident kind of weapon yeah so I should explain that a a a trident is a thunderbolt yeah I don't know how people uh how many people know this or have thought about this um and I think that it's because thanks to Disney and other things uh we like we associate associate a trident with Poseidon you know and the sea but a trident is a it's it's lightning right that for branches right that so a trident is a thunderbolt and and the the typical weapon of the storm God is a trident Thunderbolt yeah so uh that's what Zeus used the the Greek version of this is when Zeus kills Typhon uh who's the Greek Titan who is a serpent monster father monsters Etc um it uses the Thunderbolt but the Thunderbolt is really a trident like if you're imagining you know Poseidon has a trident and then Zeus has like this Jagged thing you know that looks like a piece of cartoon lightning that's not actually that's not actually how they depicted it so anyway um so uh uh so he kills uh he kills uh rra and um this you know and this is the this is the basic pattern of of the myth um and uh it shows up in the myth the hittite story actually probably the oldest recorded version that we have of this particular myth is the myth of the hittite uh uh God ilanka and it's a little tenuous like I said uh would you try to trace Dragon Stories and how they develop over time you think it's going to be like I'll just start pulling this thread and see where it goes but it it's the spider web but but we just say that the oldest Dragon slang stories that have are found in Kuna form uh but they're they're written in hittite or in Lan which would have been like the language probably spoken by the Trojans right the Trojans were essentially Hittites um and uh who had a very Who had who had a vast Empire and some of these these stories go back to I think the earliest ones that we have we can reliably date to something like the 16th be uh uh uh Century BC something like that like really old or maybe a little bit older than that and um they seem to have made their way VIA era via um kind of uh contact with the north of the Levant they seem to have made their way eventually into Mesopotamia so in Mesopotamian Legend you have an anal Alish which is the the Mesopotamian creation myth um and it famously of course you've got you know Sumerian and Acadian versions of it but uh more recent research has those as being maybe slightly younger by a couple of hundred years than the uh the hittite version so some people will say that it's originally a Semitic myth that travels West and like Northwest and then other people say it's actually an indoeuropean myth that originally traveled into the the near East somehow um it's probably impossible to say definitively it doesn't really matter but what all a lot of these stories have in common not all of them but what a lot of these stories have in common is this idea of um that is is tying it somehow into the idea of creation right so that the storm God when he kills the chaos serpent right he's able to separate uh the land from the sea right separate the land from the sea um so this this has this manifests a lot later on in basically every other dragon slaying myth that you find that you'll encounter in either the ancient near East or uh or Europe and uh so for instance the the most famous Norse dragon is fathir fafnir is actually a dwarf he's a son of a powerful Sorcerer And after essentially after his family comes into the possession of a horde of cursed gold faer drives his brother off turns himself into a dragon and guards The Horde himself right and um eventually Along Comes a guy named sigard the volsang or in the earlier versions of the story he has father cund so there's that fatherson pair that's uh or sometimes uncle nephew pair that's really important in these kinds of stories he slays the dragon with some help usually from a son or from a nephew or from somebody who's both a son and a nephew in the case of uh in the case of incest MH um and uh he kills the dragon the way that the dragon is almost always killed in the Western European version which is uh instead of being struck by a ThunderBolt from above he is stabbed From Below right so that's how fath is killed that's how B Wolf's Bane um although if you want to know the the name of B Wolf's Bane like the name of the dragon of bolf you can you can go but listen to the glasses but um uh but yeah that Dragon uh uh it's so this seems to be kind of like a theme in in the sort of like the Western Northwestern European version of the story is that the way that you kill a dragon is you stab it from below yeah um and um the the significance of fafnir hoarding gold instead of water is actually pretty simple to understand it's that um it's that uh the the the culture of the Iron Age dramatic North was not agrarian it was essentially what what I've described uh elsewhere in the baywolf class as a pirate economy right so it works on it works by going and rating somebody taking their gold and then using that gold it's a pirate gift economy using that gold to give gifts to your retainers which is not the same thing as paying them it's a it's a there's a difference but you use it to give gifts to your retainers who then give you service right so there's this reciprocity reciprocal generosity but you you you have to have gold to be generous with and there are no gold mines in in uh in Norway right so you've got to go get the gold some other way right so you go raid you know you go do your Christmas shopping at lindis far and then you that's that's a joke um yeah you you you a horrible joke I know I'm really sorry I'm really sorry Christmas sharing and Linda is fine I'm I'm really sorry man yeah see I see your Northern roots are coming out trying really hard to to hide all of that but yeah so you go you go raid England or you go raid like northern France before the Normans who were essentially Vikings right right before they settled there right you go raid somebody civilized and then you get their gold and then use that gold to keep your economy going so this is why in bwolf we talk about this in the class but there's this huge focus on baywolf on generosity the the king's role as as ringger and uh uh herode who's the worst King right he's the archetypical evil man evil King right the example that gets brought up over and over again in the poem his whole deal is that he's he's stingy because he's like afraid of what's going to happen in the future like if I give this away then I won't have it for later kind of a thing right and so because of that his kingdom collapses right and so if you're not generous then uh then Society collapses so a way to think about what a dragon is is that it um at least in some permutations it Hoards whatever is necessary for you to exist as a society now this is where we get to to this the kind of like the the but what abouts right and so one of the things that you can say definitively is that all the oldest versions of dragon stories in all the oldest versions of Dragon Stories drag the dragon has an enemy the enemy is usually a Thunder God or somebody that associated in some way with a Thunder God um obviously all of this eventually shows up much later um from the perspective like the hittite stories shows up much later in like the Bale cycle and so on and I will just I will hear in V against um uh modern Scholars of the ancient near East so I hope you're listening folks um uh sometimes when you read accounts of this and you're reading about all these Thunder gods and the dragons they killed and everything you'll get something like so these six lines of Cana form allow us to say all of these things uh with great certainty about the ancient louan storm God but then there's this guy in the this this God in the southern Levant Yahweh and we just don't know anything about him he's so perplexing but he seems to have been some kind of a bull deity you know but unfortunately nothing helpful has ever been written about Yahweh you know like nothing that we can rely on it's just very aggravating it's like you get six lines of canor you say all these things with absolute certainty but when it comes to the god of the Bible well obviously we can't trust the Bible so we got to go to non-biblical sources for for yeah yeah we need to find some line of uniform on a broken tablet somewhere that we don't know what the context right yeah so anyway that's my that's my deep frustration which I was feeling as I was putting together the notes for our conversation but yeah but it's this by the way it's important for Christians at some point we've understood that it's like that for everything Christian it's like you know every Everything Christian has this well the the people who told Jesus's story must be lying because they knew him yeah okay how the hell like how the hell didn't we get the story it's like so the people who wrote it because they're close to it they must be line because they're trying to make it look good and so anyways yeah so but this brings up an important point because the main thing that we've been doing in Universal history from the very start is actually trying to look at these things like Through The Eyes of the people who wrote them like yeah take those people seriously right and U I mean to go back to uh our last video about the about Christmas one of the things we uh we I we kind of mentioned a little bit and then probably didn't elaborate on enough for some people it is talking about the date of Christmas right so this you know so if you look at if you look at um lot of early like uh third Century on uh Christian authors right who are putting together chronologies December the 25th is the date that they signed to the to to the birth of Christ right and this is even before we have reliable dates for like some of those Pagan winter celebrations yeah like like Soul Invictus and things like that so so um if we just look at it from the perspective of the early church this is when everybody believed Christ Christ was born right and so the only reason to reject that as we said is this idea that it just makes too much sense right or this idea and this is really what it comes down to is this idea that if you find something in Christianity that is similar to Something in some other religion it must other religion has to always have been the source that's right right it can never it could never have happened the other way yeah because you see the same with the northern uh you know with the with the Scandinavian stories which is that you know if there's a resemblance between Christianity even though Christians wrote this down if there's a resemblance between Christianity and these stories it must be that they influenc Christianity which is just so hilarious I I once had somebody really argue very sincerely with me that um that the story of Christ crucifixion had never happened it was just based on the myth myth of oen hanging himself on the world tree I like okay but that myth nobody even came up with that story like no one had even heard of oen in the first century ad like he's a late God you know like he's a very late God in the north Pantheon like like there's no way that could be the case his story was WR literally written a thousand years later but but by Christians right by Christians but but this this person just could not accept the idea that if there was a similarity yeah that Christianity might have been like the original the origin of it so anyway all of this to say all of this to say um uh what were we talking we get back to yeah I'm so sorry I'm so sorry but uh uh so all of this to say it is it is really important to actually point out that if you read the Bible you will find that there's a lot of Yahweh killing the dragon kind of stuff going on in the Old Testament and by the way also in the New Testament right and um and this is really deliberate this is really really deliberate right um because so many of those passages in the Psalms or for instance in the book of Isaiah which talks about uh um Christ uh it talks about Yahweh killing Lon or Leviathan right um all of those passages they they're a um they have a sort of pical uh point they're trying to make which is that all these things that you think about Baal right or the uh Baal hadat in in particular right who who's like sort of the storm God in that in that cycle um uh all these things that you think are true about him or his sister or whoever is supposed to kill Leviathan in the different versions of that story or that you think are true about Marduk if it's the Babylonian version or whatever like all those things are actually true about the God of Israel but they're more true about the God of Israel right because B swallowed by death but um you know but but our God will swallow up death that kind that kind of a thing right and so when you come across this this um uh you could say like really cosmological I don't know the right word for it uh imagery of of of Yahweh sort of you riding the clouds and scattering uh the light lightning like his arrows and all this different stuff in the Psalms which is incredibly cool uh there's no need to be alarmed as that at that as a Christian right there's no need to be alarmed at because of course this is his world this is the world that he made these things belong to him and and those particular passages they do have a certain purpose right they had a purpose then they also have a purpose now right uh in in sort of showing his his his Supremacy over creation over the waters and many of Christ's Miracles are actually aimed at uh in his own lifetime I I think that we talked you and I talked recently about this not in a in a recorded conversation or we were talking about some new Miracles and uh talking about something like walking on water right and we think of that as like kind of um um in English when when you say so and so could walk on water what he saying is that person is so holy they're just like us it's a way of like it's a little pejorative it's like saying they're kind of a goody goody two shoes kind of a thing but the whole idea of walking on Waters is that is that chaos itself is under his feet yeah right you know that the the the Lord who established the Earth upon the waters as it says in the Psalms right it has total dominance over the waves has total dominance over the elements right these these things that are the Abode of death and chaos and the serpent all these different things all those things are under Christ's feet and this is the idea in the icon of theophany where we show him crushing the head of a serpent in the waters this is in the Liturgy in the Orthodox Church um I mean if you want dragons in church like go to baptism and or or or like the great blessing of the waters right theophany right and here just listen to the prayers talking about asking asking God right the god of Israel Jesus Christ to come down and crush the heads of the serpents in the waters right um and and any dragon any unclean Spirit any of those things that are lurking in water as the the sort of like primordial source of of chaos and instead uh reveal the the the creative potential like the The Good the the good side the good potential of water to create and give life and cleanse and he yeah there's so many images of Christ where if you understand the relationship between the dragon and water and you know you can see it obviously as Orthodox it's easier to see because it's all there in the prayers it's there in the icon and you kind of get it but once you understand that then you'll understand some of the images for example that Christ always has these two aspects to him on the one hand he is dominating over chaos and on that's on one hand on the other hand he is also let's say giving himself to the chaos to dominate it in the surprise right so when in the story where Christ goes and sleeps in the boat uh and then comes out to master the waters like all of that is relating to Jonah it's relating to all these IM and it's it's obviously you know showing what's going to happen in terms of the death and Resurrection uh that he can descend into the he can go into the dragon's mouth B basically enter into the dragon you know that image that we have of the the warrior that sacrifices himself and goes into the Beast and then cuts it up from the inside you see that in the the the the iconography of St uh St Margaret um you know that's that's it like that's the imagy of Christianity but it is related to the waters and the dragon all comes together in death all these images come together that's also the ending of shark NATO by the way oh I haven't seen shark so I'm really sorry to even bring this up but there was this movie came out many years ago um I think it was like two houses ago or something for us so a long time ago I had way fewer children but this movie came out and it was like the the idea was like just mash up two 90s you know like mash up jaws with Knight of the Twisters or something like that kind of a thing and so like there's this big tornado and it starts dumping sharks everywhere and the sharks are eating everybody it's a terrible movie it's really dumb really bad but it was funny how like uh in the end so I sat down with my brother-in-law to watch it as like kind of like a Mystery Science Theater 3000 like like mock it kind of a thing and uh it was really interesting like at the end of the movie the main character gets swallowed by a shark and then he chainsaws his way out and I even remember at the time thinking like man you know even making a A Goofy Movie that's that that was that was not made with any intention of it being good they just made this to make a dumb movie just for the memes B you know uh uh but but but even even at the end like they couldn't get away from the Christian symbolism right like cutting your way out of the monster so yeah um yeah really sorry everybody I didn't know I was going to talk about that today but um but I mean actually I mean the movie Jaws right is a great example of of really what is a Dragon Story yeah right the idea of like the dragon lurking in the depths now you could say that uh well a a shark is a dragon it's not even a reptile you know what are you going on about etc etc right but but it's function it's functioning in that story it's functioning as a dragon yeah well we can see like the the representation of the monster that swallowed up Jonah in in Tradition even from like the second century image we have one of the earliest images in Christianity we have is of Jonah being swallowed by that that uh that fish but it's a it's basically a sea monster it's a dragon really it's a sea dragon man there's some crazy stuff about the about Jonah in the services of the Orthodox Church as well like if you go to matens uh one of the Cannons that matens like always has the theme of Jonah yeah Jonah Matt Canon like every morning if you're at a you know place where they're doing matens every day right or you know at least every Sunday at your church right there will be at least one verse or set of verses that on the theme of The Feast but but it will work Jonah in there some somehow and you know this idea of of um you know the sea monster spewing out Jonah like a babe from the womb right and Christ raising up as a as a bride Chamber from as as from a bridal chamber like stuff like that is is wild stuff yeah so so yeah um uh the the other thing that I want to say though is that there is a there is a positive aspect to dragons or at least this idea that you can take some of the aspects of the Dragon it's it's uh so so like to go back to the hybrid right um hybrids are dangerous right because of uh for various different reasons right um but they're also uh hybrids have a certain like resilience to them right and in fact in in uh animal husbandry and things like that or or the whole horiculture the whole idea of like hybrid resilience is like if you get a strain of like a species or a breed that's like two pure bread um this happened with fruit trees um it also happens with like modern like dog breeds you know if you look at what a German Shepherd looks like now as opposed to what one looked like even 100 years ago you know it's really dramatic difference um where where you you selectively breed too long for these very specific features right and then what you lose as a result is everything that made the breed strong and actually capable of doing work right and so then the question of well how do I get take one of these you know you probably can't take your cocker spaniel hunting for instance right even though he's a bird dog right uh probably not gonna probably not going to work out um uh because he's too fragile um uh my my parents own many cocker spaniels when I was a kid and I could just tell you they're very fragile very neurotic animals right but wasn't always so um and so you know so there is a kind of like a strength and a resilience to the idea of the hybrid um also the dragon's capacity as a guardian right if you're guarding something uh you're only a threat to what's on the outside but if you're on the inside then you you actually want that right and so lots and lots of cultures and I mean lots and lots of cultures pretty much every drag culture that has a Dragon Story which is all of them will use dragons in this kind of app traic way um Welsh culture is a great example it's my favorite example because of course you know it's right on the flag it's right on the coat of arms it goes back to like the oldest stuff I mean Arthur himself right pen Dragon right head of a dragon right like like he's um Arthur himself is associated with dragon imagery over and against right the Saxons right um and that that that that early story like generation or two before Arthur right of you know the the white dragon the red dragon fighting right you know beneath the castle and eventually the red dragon is which is the the the Welsh or the bonic dragon is going to win the fight right and so um uh but also lots and lots of dragon stuff going on in uh Germanic Iron Age culture Old English Old Norse Etc um very common to to put dragons on things like the crust of a helmet yeah or the face of a Shield or The prow of a ship right um and this was stuff that just sort of like came naturally to people like if I want this to be scary to my enemies what would I put on it the scariest thing that anybody could imagine yeah right which which is a dragon right and it's playing with very this is playing with very very deep symbolism that ends up in the medical symbolism as well you know the idea of you know I think I might have mentioned this before the uh in the the symbol of the serpent on the on the rod the what's his name what's the name of the god uh cadus no it's not the cadus it's a I'm going to think about it later it's going to come to me anyways so the the Roman god of the basically the Roman God of healing he the story is that he he kills the gorget which is this Dragon kind of sea uh serpent monster and and he takes the blood from the right side of the serpent and makes yeah it's it's it's hermas but it's it's called the the the the the caduceus is the name but no this is it's not the same this is this is a different this is different healing god with a with a snake yes it is I'm sorry darn it I don't know why I I I don't know why I don't know why his name isn't coming to me I usually I've written about this anyway it doesn't matter um uh and so he takes the blood from the right side of the serpent to make healing but then the idea is that the blood from the left side of the serpent basically is the poison and so this idea of this apotropaic function of poison right as both that which kills you or that which saves you is the is the very symbolism of of medicine itself right it's a it's it's using the poison to create a cure out of the poison right this idea of of uh of trampling death by death basically of using death against itself it's always been uh weird to me as an aside how if you look at a lot of ancient abstract imagery of the the caducus or you anyway the rod you're talking about um that uh it has um uh it a lot ofus it's the rod of esus esus okay right I'm such an idiot like I'm like it's gonna come just send the Google search on in my one days too it's all right so uh yeah buffering please wait but but when you look at um when you look at uh abstract um versions of it you you find in like Sumerian imagery because it's there and it's in India as well right that a lot of times abstract it looks like a it looks like a DNA Helix yeah which I've always thought is a very interesting well that's a good way to represent it like the caducan rod is a good way to represent it instead of just one you have two snakes basically that they are right snake and a left snake one that two are facing each other like in in Conflict uh and in the in the case of Hermes it really has to do with the bridge it has to do with this in between space that is a double-sided space right it this is Theus aspius has the one snake the r caducus has the two guys you're watching us just like figure this out but esus is directly related to to healing in Roman mythology whereas Hermes is is in some way seen as this messenger figure yeah but that it's related because the the messenger the in between or the the the bridge or the this is the problem of the hybrid right it's like this in between space that goes both ways it's like it can either uh it could either be a guardian or a you're right it could either be something which is defining or something which is going to bring bring chaos right that's the Theus also associated with RH was also associated with like rhetoric it was the symbol of of rhetoric in the ancient world I think for the same for the same reason right you know the capacity of Ric to sort of heal or hurt you know um yeah yeah so um we with this yes integrating I'm sorry guys it's hard because dragons will bring you all over the place that's exactly what they do because they're very the symbolism is quite is quite big so um so when we're talking about like integrating the aspects of the the serpent or integrating the aspects of a dragon right this is where um this is why basically everybody that I've ever talked to about doing this video that we're doing right now will say something like oh I'm really looking forward to your symbolic world video on uh and I've had like 10 people say this to me really looking forward to the symbolic world video on dragons because I don't understand what's going on with Asian dragons and why they're different you know because they're obviously they're very different because they're like good luck and all these different things well folks here it is they're the same that's it they're the same thing um uh if you go back and look at really early like Bronze Age um uh Chinese dragons uh they're usually sometimes called Pig dragons or pigheaded dragons because basically it's like a serpent usually kind of curled up in a sort of a fetal position but it's a serpent with the head of a pig um and then it seems like um contact with the uh uh with the like the Persian world via the Silk Road right so anytime we're talking about anything actually uh from this period you have to understand there was a there was a very very heavily used trade route between China and Baghdad you know and and uh uh you know and even before Baghdad was Baghdad like the very heavily used trade route between the ancient near East and and there for eventually the Roman world uh when that comes to develop but anyway very very well-used trade route between the ancient near East and the Far East yeah and what this means is that if if if you think of these things to be like totally different worlds it's not totally accurate they they are in some ways but but but they they actually share a lot more than you would think so um it seems like because of uh by the Iron Age because of of contact with dragon imagery in Persia and elsewhere um that eventually the the the the Chinese version of the Dragon comes into much greater alignment with with that's why I was saying earli if you look at a picture of a of a Persian Dragon which we'll put up here on the screen it looks just like a Chinese dragon essentially right and so then what eventually happens in China is that you get two forms they have two different names but uh basically the main difference is one has wings and the other one doesn't and then eventually the wingless version becomes predominant but if you go back and you look at the very earliest Chinese dragon stories which we have recorded and we have some very old ones because uh they were an incredibly literate Society even from you know very early time um their water their their Guardian they're they are they are Serpentine Spirits or deities or beings who guard bodies of water and and then sometimes this is what's interesting to make also control the rainfall um so Norm like in the what you do have in the West in like the indoeuropean version of the story is that um the uh uh the the the main enemy of the Dragon is often the the Thunder God who controls the rainfall and in China it's the the sort of like the dragon is the Thunder God sometimes yeah um but yeah is a is a serpentine deity or Spirit or being or monster that's a hybrid of all these different kinds of animals and controls these various bodies of water and a lot of the early stories have to do with not trying to slay the dragon although there is one that I've one one or two that I found although a lot of the dragon slaying stories actually seem to have come from Buddhism who probably uh uh probably got them from from India or maybe from uh uh the Christian near East something like that and then so in some like later Buddhist mythology dragons do become representative of these demons that represent the passions and Etc but but in the earliest stuff uh for the most part uh instead of trying to slay the dragon to get the water you're trying to appease the dragon in some way with a gift of some kind trying to appease the dragon to get the water what eventually happens and this is really important for uh Chinese Cultural identity all the way up to the to the revolution really is um that the dragon becomes Associated specifically with the emperor to the point that it becomes illegal to um uh for anybody that's not part of the Imperial family to even use a dragon as a symbol on anything um and then um and there are there's whole different kinds of things about um I mentioned earlier there's a lot of symbolism for different different kinds of dragon like certain numbers of features and scales and spots and things like this so there's like one dragon that you would use if you were the emperor and but then if you were some member of the Imperial family but not the emperor yourself there was another dragon that you would get to use but it wouldn't be like it wouldn't have quite all the same features and so um but basically the dragon became synonymous with Imperial power right and so in that same way that you can take the aspect of the dragon and then kind of harness it right uh but then also there's also with that there's always this this there's always an aspect to a dragon of of its potential to hoard or oppress yeah so so you could imagine that the connection is that if you see the the dragon as a guardian of water you could understand that as a guardian of blessings like you could you could that could easily go into that direction and so once you see that then you can understand why the the the guardian of the blessing the guardian of waters could be like a sign of good luck in that sense right it's right that if I make the dragon happy then I then it opens up the door so that this stuff will come down on me right and you can understand why that would then end up being that could be related to the Emperor or to some person of authority because they are the guardians of blessing the guardian of blessings with the other really interesting thing is um if you read a lot of old stuff about dragons in Chinese and this is still the case by the way in modern like Asian organized crime is this idea that if you put the image of the Dragon on something but you're not worthy of it uh actually you find the same kind of thing in Scandinavian uh mythology and stuff but if you if you put the if you put the image of the Dragon on something but you are not sufficiently Dragon like yourself then it's not good luck it's actually quite the opposite like the dragon will consume you like if you if you take the symbol of the Dragon for yourself but you're not strong and and and lucky and you know all these things that a dragon is right if you're not those things enough then actually you'll get the the wrong kind of attention from the dragon um which is which I I think is the case of like apotropaic imagery in general right the idea that that uh you want to make sure it's outward facing and if but if you're not like Yourself Strong then try to put yourself behind this thing and sort of hide yourself behind it it'll end up turning in on you and kind of consuming and eating right and you can understand that as the you know if you think of curus or these kind of marginal figures that are in between spaces that guard the the guard the world of death for example and they kind of act they kind of act both ways they'll stop they stop things from the outside to come in but they can also prevent you from going out if you're not if you're not care careful and the the the similarity between medieval iconography Western medieval iconography of demons and Western medieval iconography of of gargoyles is exactly that in some ways they very similar in nature and one is facing out and the other is coming towards you but it can always that's why there's even an ambiguous in modern kind of popular culture there's an ambiguous uh relationship to things like gargoyles let's say you know where they're seeing almost as ominous and evil because they're on that they're on that edge you know and so something to say as maybe just like kind of a final note to this is that there are plenty of examples in Christian iconography of of you you would think we would just always be anti-dragon all the time but there are plenty of examples of dragons again cherubim and sarapin being a really easy example right uh but there are sort of like monsters that are on our side or like the the idea of the monster guarding Paradise I've been to lots of Orthodox churches in more than one country where uh on the on the holy doors right the the holy doors in front of the altar there would be like sort of you know border patterns of dragons right same thing in the Middle Ages doors of churches um later on when pews come in uh even like carvings on the outside of pews and things like that right so so this is this is actually and of course lots of Christian countries lots of Christian countries use dragons as part of their they're massive dragons on MOS uh you know on the iconostasis and usually they're akin to the symbolism of the bishop staff which is that you'll usually have two dragons under the cross kind of facing the cross uh on the ionas if you have a cross the top of it um you know and it I think it is related to this but the the deepest and most mysterious aspect of the symbolism is the fact that Christ takes the shape of a serpent on the cross that is and that's where I wanted to end was was and it starts with Moses lifting up the serpent in the wilderness so he takes the pole and puts the serpent on it and of course going back to uh the rod of aus or the caducus right you've got uh this idea of like a serpent on a pole as a source of healing as a source of life right but that's in that's an exodus yeah or numbers anyway it's it's a yeah it's in numbers yeah it's in numbers and and uh and Christ says my crucifixion is like this you know he says that that's it's one of the times that the Bible interprets the Bible for you which is always handy you know like sometimes you can like sit around and like really think about these things and overthink them a little bit but there are a a a a precious few number of times where Jesus will just tell you this is what this thing means right and so he says even as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so the must must the son of man be lifted up right and if I am lifted up when I am lifted up I will draw all men to me right and so this uh and so um I said we were gonna stop here but but kind of continuing kind of can go ahead but I just want to say like yeah to understand the mystery of Christ you know you have to understand it or the mystery of the god of Israel and how he manifests himself in the world you have to be able to see the three parts of this story which is on the one hand Christ is swallowed by the snake on the one hand he becomes the snake and on the on the one hand he kills the snake and he does all three kind of simultaneously on the cross uh which is very it's a I mean it's it's one of those instances where you know there's no story to tell after that it's pretty much reach the limit of what the symbolism of the snake is there is this there is this kind of a strange thing with the image of the Dragon especially the winged dragon so just talk about this varant for a moment not every dragon has wings um that's is if not like a universal but lots of dragons have wings or can fly right uh going back to like the Asian Dragon you know they always they're always able to fly right and this is why they can be associated with the terrestrial water and also the water that's from above yeah um there is this kind of weird thing with serpents and birds so this is something that came up in the bolf class that uh i' I I've just thought about a lot since he talking about this idea that you have in some old stories for instance the the the story of fair who who again is the sort of the archetypical Old Norse Dragon this idea that uh if you eat the heart of a dragon you can understand the speech of birds m right to understand the speech of birds and the idea of the speech of birds is always associated with let's say like Heavenly wisdom right um so then like what's what's going on there what's the connection there and and as we were talking about it uh I it occurred to me um you know Christ Command right be wise as serpents and harmless as doves right that this is connect this that this has to be that this is connected in some way right yeah that in some ways two actually if you you could do them simultaneously yeah yeah and uh and again that's like one of those things that I still have not like fully you know I don't know it's hard to talk about because it's one of the things like I have an intuition there but it's not fully formed yeah it's difficult because one of the things that makes it difficult is that in some ways this symbolism of the wing serpent for example uh is one of the most is one of the oldest and kind of the most universal symbolism like you find these the symbolism in north in like South America when the the the Spanish and North America and Egypt yeah it's really everywhere and so it is in some ways a you know it is this Union of Heaven and Earth maybe it is this it's kind of poking at certain imagery that's very difficult to fully grasp and in and because of what the dragon represents you can kind of understand how it can become parasitical you know if it if you understand it as a guardian it can always be both affording and preventing and it can always at the same time become um how can I say this it can just like the principalities in general that say you imagine principalities above you how they can afford Grace from above or they can actually St make the grace stop from at where they are that seems to be one of the some of the symbolism that that is being Shak up here okay so in your recent conversation with Father Joseph Lucas which was tremendous by the way people should go back and listen to it if they didn't listen because because it was really really good but one of the curious things in there St serel of Alexandria when he's talking about the the scapegoat right and he says Christ being uh the the the scapegoat being sent out into the Wilderness is like Christ ascending to heaven and I remember how weird that seemed right H and and this is one of the frustrating things about listening to your friends you know and Father Joseph is a good friend of mine and you're a good friend of mine the really difficult thing about listening to your friends have a conversation but you're not actually there for keep wanting to jump in yeah I know and what I what I wanted to say about that actually so this is me jumping in what I wanted to say about that actually is that that's a very that's actually a relatively common patristic interpretation you find the same thing in St Gregory palamas who lived a lot longer you know uh much later than St s and the reason the reason for this it goes back to this idea like we we're used to like thinking of the Wilderness as the Abode of the Demons but also the air is the Abode of the Demons yeah yeah yeah right the the air is the air is the Abode of the Demons right and so you have this idea St Greg talks about of Christ sort of like clearing a path for us as he's ascending right clearing a path for us so that we can pass sort of pass up unharmed even I know it's like people freak out if you imagine this but even the idea of you know what I'm going to say yeah we know what you're talking about yeah that's what it's dealing with the the houses that you have to kind of encounter well in St Paul we in the on Sunday's reading you know that's what it it say yeah yeah it's talks about that about exactly so I just I just like so so but this is related to the idea of the the fiery the the fiery flying serpent right yeah this this idea that that there are these kind of that there there could be these like monstrous principalities that guard not just uh you know that guard access to Paradise like I don't know how to say it you know yeah and um uh and there's association with their capacity to fly right and the sort of access to I mean one of the one of the tropes it doesn't always come up but it often comes up with dragons and going back to the idea of eating the heart so you can understand the language of birds is related to this is is uh a lot of times dragons are considered to be very wise or or have access to wisdom or knowledge about things that humans don't have right you find this in some of like the uh zor asrian dragon stories as well for instance so this idea that this the idea that the dragon has access to to this knowledge right but then of course sometimes sometimes uh uh sometimes knowledge is not good for you right sometimes that wisdom is not good for you so so it's got that kind of ambiguity to it yeah no for sure I mean we're not going to get out of the ambiguity we in the symbolism of the Dragons because I'm thinking again now like the way that the dragon represented in Revelation you know as the great this great dragon that pulls the stars that pulls the principalities and captures them basically under his rule um you know it's like okay there's another image of how he's hoarding he's hoarding these angels in his grasp and now he's you know kind of mastering them for his own for his own will um you know there's another image that's very similar uh but now the dragon is definitely represent in in all the Revelation the dragon is definitely the devil he's not yes there no question at all that's right so so I think that it's it's really I think we're we're still we're back at the beginning yeah in the sense that you know if someone thought they would come here uh and get a dictionary definition of what a dragon is not GNA happen yeah but here's here's the thing about dragons though if you see one you know it that's you know it's one of the things like very hard to nail down a definition across the board but I can look at a a dragon in a Chinese image yeah and I can look at uh uh the the carving of the midgard serpent on the door of a church in Norway and I can look at you know a a a Persian illumination of a dragon and I can look at uh you know something from South America and I can look at all of those things and say that's a dragon that's a dragon that's right yeah yeah all right everyone well that's our discussion about Dragon thanks everybody for your attention and and uh and I think that both of us both Richard and I were still yeah still processing and still processing the discussion and so uh get involved in the commentaries this is the time you know tell us your your uh your insights about Dragon so thanks everybody we'll talk to you soon thanks everyone
