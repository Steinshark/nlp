i think anyone can learn how to code but sadly most don't there's a lot of different reasons to it but i think it mostly boils down to one thing people quit people just don't stick to it maybe it's sort of a self-fulfilling prophecy but people don't believe that they can do it so they end up just either not trying or just quitting the first time that something gets difficult and that's such a shame because the world needs programmers it's actually a skill that so many companies in today's world need yet people just don't put in the work and this aren't disciplined enough to actually get there to get the point where you can actually be useful and yes getting your first job is difficult proving that you should be the one that the company puts resources into and trains is not easy that is why you need to have the discipline to get there to get to the point where someone actually wants to hire you because once someone does hire you lives just gets so much easier everything i've heard once you have a couple of years of experience as a software engineer getting interviews at other companies becomes so incredibly easy but most people just don't get to that point and there's a couple of reasons for it firstly people just focus on the wrong things for example focusing on the nitty-gritty details before even understanding the broad context focusing on or which language should i learn rather than just picking a language and learning it properly going too advanced very quickly trying to learn some like really advanced concepts before you even know how to code in the first place just focus on the broad context first and then dive into the details later that is the way to do it if you want to learn anything effectively you need to understand what is most important at what stage and the way you should approach it is sort of like learning the outer layer the broad context first then going a bit deeper than a bit deeper while constantly applying and ingraining concepts into your brain but before we move on i need to tell you about something very exciting which is today's video sponsor delphi delphi is an integrated development environment dedicated to building windows macos android and ios applications written in object pasco what makes it stand out is that delphi allows you to build really complex applications really fast and they do this by implementing a concept called rapid application development which means that besides a programming language delphi offers a visual designer that allows the programmer to click and add components together users especially appreciate delphi for the fact that you can design your interface and preview what it will look like really easily in addition delphi allows you to build native apps for all platforms like windows mac os android and whatever by writing your app just once because delphi comes with its own compilers to compile your code to make it into native applications for all of these platforms at once without you having to do anything and in terms of performance these compilers are as fast as they come compared to any other compiler output this also makes your apps really easy to build and it saves significantly on costs of maintaining your application so if you want to check them out you can go to the link down below in my description to start off with their 30-day free trial now back to the video the second reason is having the wrong mindset anything worth learning is not going to be a sprint it's going to be a marathon because anything valuable anything worth learning is by definition not easy to learn but you should do it anyway because the rewards of having the skill in today's world are so incredibly great but most people do not approach it that way most people don't realize that you need to actually putting a lot of effort over a long consistent period of time thirdly the part where a lot of people trip up is looking for the perfect course thinking that there is some perfect magical curriculum that's gonna just teach you everything and if you don't do these perfect course you're never gonna learn it the most common question i get on this channel is what is the best way to start to learn the code in reality it doesn't even matter just start with something i'm sure there is value in choosing a course that's better than another that's why on this channel i do still talk about the best resources but essentially you shouldn't spend too much time on figuring out what is the perfect course to do because there isn't a perfect course just pick one that seems great that other people seem to recommend at least somewhat and just stick to it just start it just do everything and just finish it at the end of the day which course you do doesn't even matter because all of them will probably teach you broadly the same things and another mistake people make not learning to learn learning how to effectively learn something in my opinion just as important as actually learning the concept that you're actually learning if you learn how to learn things effectively you're going to be able to learn anything not just coding not just computer science you're going to be able to learn you know human languages you're going to learn how to play the guitar learning to learn is probably the best skill that you can learn in your life to improve your life in every area not just this but most people don't even realize that that's a thing to sort of do what seems intuitive what seems to be the right way to do things without even putting any effort into what is actually the best way to do it and lastly specifically related to coding most people don't realize coding is all about googling that's right most people don't become great coders because they don't know how to google things so many questions that i get on my comment section for example are questions that you could just google essentially there's probably someone on stackoverflow wherever has already answered these questions before there's a million different people who have already answered these same questions before all you have to do is go find them using google's amazing search algorithm you're probably gonna find the best answers right at the top because that's how the algorithm is designed learn how to google things whenever you have a question when you're building a project when you're figuring out which project to build google these questions whenever you have a question in your mind in any facet of your life take the habit of going on google writing that exact question on google and seeing what comes up sure sometimes you won't find the answer but a lot of times you will and being a great programmer even senior engineers i'm not a senior engineer yet but even senior engineers what they say is that it's all about just knowing how to google there's naming memes about it the difference between a senior software engineer and a junior software engineer is that the seniors know how to google better than a junior learn have to google things if you learn how to fix these mistakes and you just don't freaking quit if you just stick to it if you just freaking do the things you learn how to code just don't quit solve problems don't quit thanks for watching
