hello everyone and welcome in this video we are talking about the next step for the supercharger install which is putting the s2000 on the dyno and making sure that everything is working as it's supposed to now the kit the stage one kit which is what i've installed on this is supposed to be good for 6 psi and it comes with a controller so it controls the air fuel ratio the timing when vtec engages things like that so ideally you don't have to touch anything after you've installed this kit it does it all for you but you do really want to put it on a dyno and make sure that you're getting the actual air fuel ratios that you are anticipating you should be getting so science of speed actually provides a chart and they say put it on a dyno and make sure that your air fuel ratio looks something like this and that your fuel pressure looks like that so basically they want to make sure that your air fuel ratio is floating somewhere between about an 11 and a half to one to about 12 to one as the ideal ratio there for this kit on this engine so i took my s2000 to throttleworks which is an awesome shop located in boise so if you're in the boise idaho area and looking for a great shop throttle works has been awesome to work with so i put my s2000 on the dyno there to verify our air fuel ratios and i know the question that everyone is wondering is how much power does this car now make so we put it on the dyno and at 6 psi at about 8 800 rpm it saw an increase of 80 horsepower uh so about a 40 a little bit more than 40 percent additional horsepower at the wheels so before putting the supercharger on we were measuring 185 on a mustang dyno after putting the supercharger on we are measuring about 265 horsepower at the wheels on a mustang dyno now if you are curious what this would be like on dynojet numbers they do some tweaking uh to show the numbers and it's low 300 range so around the 300 horsepower mark if you were to put it on dynojet i like using the mustang dyno numbers i think they're a bit more conservative and a bit more realistic so that's what i am going with uh previously 185 horsepower plus 80 horsepower is now about 265 horsepower so does that make sense and thinking about it it actually does so if atmospheric pressure is about 15 psi and i am at a little bit higher elevation i'm about 2 700 feet here in idaho but if atmospheric pressure is around 15 psi and we add 6 psi of additional air to that 6 out of 15 is 40 so we should see about a 40 roughly increase in power and that is what we saw a little bit more than 40 uh 80 additional horsepower at the wheel so very cool to see 265 horsepower but the peak number is not what's super important it's important to look at the curve all right so looking at the curves for both torque and horsepower before and after installing the supercharger you can see that power and torque remain about equal until about 3500 rpm and then that's where things start to separate and so by about 4300 rpm the supercharger is up about 17 pound-feet in torque and it's producing about one to two psi here in this range and then psi just continues to increase and torque continues to increase with it so just before vtec you're looking at a torque increase uh for the supercharged engine of about 30 pound-feet and the previous engine without the supercharger peak torque was at about 6800 rpm 127 pound-feet versus now peak torque continues to climb all the way to about 8 100 rpm where it peaks at 163 pound-feet so overall uh you know starting in the 4300 rpm range up about 17 and then plus about 30 by about 6000 rpm and then about 45 pound-feet by the end of the power and torque curve at around 8 800 rpm so peak-to-peak comparisons before and after it's up about 78 horsepower and 36 pound-feet but in that power band you know where the s2000 engine is most happy which is above 6000 rpm so from about 6000 rpm to 9000 rpm it's up about 30 to 45 pound-feet of torque depending on where you're looking at there and i'll get into why we have that kind of dip and torque at the end because with these centrifugal style superchargers you should see a continuous increase in torque as psi as your boost pressure continues to increase okay so this leads us to a discussion about air fuel ratios and so this is something that you can adjust on this kit and so there's a fuel pressure regulator located right here which you can adjust if you need more or less fuel and so you want to measure the air fuel ratio so at throttle works we put an exhaust sniffer on it to measure the air fuel ratio now this is after the catalytic converter so it's actually going to measure a little bit higher than if you were to say install a wideband sensor which is you know a modification that i should be doing very soon on this as putting on a wideband sensor you want that o2 sensor before the catalytic converter because the catalytic converter will change the air fuel ratio so if you want to read the true air fuel ratio you want to measure that close to where the exhaust is coming out before it goes through a catalytic converter now it's totally fine to measure it at the exhaust i was talking with the shop about this they say typically they may see about half a point increase so instead of you know it may say 11.5 to 1 and you know the actual air fuel ratio may be around 11 to 1 but that they see good numbers using this exhaust style method to measure air fuel ratios so they were confident in it and so we use this method to measure it since i don't have an additional bung welded in front of the catalytic converter to measure and so we looked at air fuel ratios and we want to make sure that it kind of lines up with what science of speed was aiming at which was somewhere between 11 5 and 12 to 1 air fuel ratio okay so looking at a graph of the air fuel ratio along with our power and torque this is where you can start to see you know the drawbacks of having uh this piggyback style ecu and not a standalone ecu where you can have more control and you can kind of smooth out these fluctuations in the air fuel ratio and so looking at it here you can see that you know above about 4 500 rpm it does stay in the range that we want it to so it's floating between about 11 and a half and 12 and then by the time it gets to about uh 8 400 rpm 80 maybe 8 200 rpm it's starting to get super rich and it dives down into the tens but you also have a spike earlier on and i believe and i'm going to look into this more but i believe the science of speed kit changes the vtec engagement from about 6000 rpm previously to now about 4 400 rpm so it looks like what's happening is once vtec engages and it starts to get additional fuel it doesn't compensate for that perfectly once it gets additional air rather from vtec opening up it doesn't compensate perfectly with the fuel and so you see a little bit of a spike in the air fuel ratio it's still not going lean but it is certainly less rich for that moment and then it has these fluctuations in it which you know with a standalone ecu you could be able to tune out and and have a much you know smoother curve like science of speed suggests in their paperwork showing you know what is ideal so looking at this curve i think one of the cool things to think about is where is power being left on the table what's ideal with it what is not ideal with it and so looking at that curve again from about 3000 to 4000 rpm you can see it falls a little rich and because it's too rich there you are going to be losing a little bit of power as a result of that so you could increase the low end torque a bit from 3000 to 4000 rpm simply by decreasing that or increasing that air fuel ratio and then you want to get rid of that peak of course with the vtec it should be a much smoother transition when vtec engages and it should be smoother kind of across the board but honestly the power and torque probably aren't going to change much as a result of that it's staying within the safe ideal range and then there is some power that looks to be left on the table above about you know 80 300 80 200 rpm above 8 000 rpm when that air fuel ratio really starts to drop and get into the mid to low 10 air fuel ratios once it's in those tens you can see that the power curve kind of starts to to drop off a little bit with it so if you were to have an ideal air fuel ratio there for those last thousand rpm then that would probably help with the power now what's good about this is it shows that these stock injectors so this kit is using stock fuel injectors it shows that they are plenty capable of delivering the amount of fuel required because it's running rich at the highest load the highest boost pressure 6 psi at the highest rpm so 8 800 to 9000 rpm where it's sitting at 6 psi it is still able to run very rich so the fuel injectors are plenty capable of keeping up with the fuel demand uh required for this so that's good to see uh the problem with it is just that there's a little bit of power left on the table it's running a bit too rich there in order to optimize the efficiency of the engine so i think the most important question here is is it safe to drive can i go rip on it on a canyon road and thankfully the answer to that is yes because it is you know where you have that ideal power band it is remaining in safe air fuel ratios kind of in the ideal range that science of speed is looking for so that's great to see and you know that it can be safe and you're not going to run into lean situations where there's there's not enough fuel so it's good to see that i think from an optimization standpoint this is where a standalone ecu would make a lot of sense because you could you know perfect that curve and help the top end increase in power rather than kind of flatline and there's a reason why i did it this way you know if i if i wasn't making videos and i had no desire to learn about this this process then i would just go straight with the stage two kit uh but i like the process of seeing the individual gains and what is an individual change uh how is that individual change benefiting you uh you know from from start to finish so that's why i'm doing this in smaller steps rather than just you know let's go for it let's just go stage two put a ton of boost on it and see what happens i'd rather do it in steps and kind of learn along the way you know what are the strong points what are the weak points what can be improved as this core is slowly modified uh to being greater so the good news is the next video i should be ripping on this thing uh having some fun with it enjoying that new sweet spot from about 6 000 to 9000 rpm which this engine was designed for that's where it loves to be and so i'm excited to test that out enjoy the new power and have some fun in the s2000 so a big thank you to throttleworks and of course thank you all for watching and if
