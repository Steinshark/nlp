hello everyone and welcome perhaps you have seen the video of the electric ford f-150 pulling 1.25 million pounds and this was a brilliant marketing idea by ford and it was a wonderfully executed stunt so props to ford for pulling it off however i think it might give you the dangerous idea that an electric ford f-150 can actually tow 1.25 million pounds which in this video i'm going to demonstrate why i believe it cannot now it was a real stunt so the truck really did pull 1.25 million pounds however much like a well executed magic trick you know you might see a magic trick and be like wow that was amazing but then if the magician explains to you how they did it they're like okay well it's not that cool and i believe the same thing is kind of going on here with ford and towing this 1.25 million pounds so once i explained to you how it all works you'll probably be like okay wow it's not that cool it was very cool and it was a very clever idea by ford so i'm glad they did it but i want to explain the science behind it so in this video we're going to learn why this electric f-150 was capable of pulling 1.25 million pounds on a railway but why i believe it is not capable of doing so on the road okay so you're probably wondering you know what is the insanely high force that's going to be required in order to pull this 1.25 million pound load and so our problem right here we're trying to figure out what is the force required in order to move this load right here and so we have an electric ford f-150 for the purpose of this video we're just going to assume that it has four-wheel drive that all the wheels are driven it could probably do it even with two-wheel drive but we're just going to make that assumption we have a tow strap going back to the load which is 1.25 million pounds we'll get more into the toe strap later on in the video so this is our problem here and we're trying to figure out what is the force required in order to move that mass so our equation to figure out this force force equals the coefficient of rolling resistance multiplied by the normal force so we have this blue load right here it's a circle it's a wheel we're trying to pull it along with a certain force that force being f there now there's resistance from the ground to moving this load so there's a ground reaction force pushing against us when we're trying to pull that thing over so this is what is represented by our coefficient of rolling resistance and so the coefficient of rolling resistance is the ratio of the force required to pull a certain amount of weight so for example what does that mean if you had a coefficient of rolling resistance of 0.1 it would take one pound to pull a 10 pound mass because your ratio is 0.1 so 1 pound to 10 pounds 0.1 that's what that coefficient of rolling resistance is and so that plays the critical role here in how can we get this load moving now the coefficient of rolling resistance changes depending on what you're using as your wheel and what you have as your ground so the less wheel deformation and the less ground deformation you have the lower your coefficient of rolling resistance is meaning the less force you need in order to pull a certain load so for example we're going to use a say that we need to pull 10 000 pound load so we've got a regular pneumatic tire on sand that has a coefficient of rolling resistance of about 0.3 meaning in order to pull 10 000 pounds we need a 3 000 pound force to move that wheel along if we were to put a tire on the road that dramatically reduces that coefficient of rolling resistance and suddenly we can pull a 10 000 pound force with just 150 pounds of force so you're starting to see where this is going if you were to have a steel railroad wheel on pavement then that's a terrible idea because you're going to destroy the road so you don't want to do that i don't know what the numbers are for it which is why you see steel railroad wheels on steel railroad rails and so this steel on steel interaction is great because both the steel wheel and steel rail have very little deformation and as a result they have a very low coefficient of rolling resistance about .0015 meaning to pull a 10 000 pound weight all you need is 15 pounds of force to do it all right let's do some math so now that we know what all of our variables are we can calculate what this force is in order to be able to pull this 1.25 million pound load and so force is equal to the coefficient of rolling resistance we're using .0015 it could actually be less than this but we're going to be conservative here with our estimates and say it's .0015 and we need to pull a 1.25 million pound load so we multiply that across and the force required in order to pull 1.25 million pounds is 1875 pounds of force so not all that insanely high of a number but we don't yet know is this f-150 capable of actually pulling that so what is the maximum force that this electric f-150 can pull now based on traction alone we're going to look at this equation right here the force the maximum force that this truck can move forward with will be equal to the frictional coefficient of the tires multiplied by the normal force and so we're going to assume it has enough power i have no doubt that it does and you can always use gears if needed to have more torque at the ground so no problems there so the force is going to be equal to let's say our frictional coefficient is 1.0 nice conservative estimate and then our normal force here let's say the truck weighs 5000 pounds now it may weigh a little bit more it may weigh a little bit less we don't know how much it weighs but that's in line with a current uh supercrew cab f-150 so this means the maximum force that this f-150 assuming it has four-wheel drive can move forward and pull is 5 000 pounds and so obviously 5 000 pounds is greater than 1 875 pound force and so as a result this thing is capable of pulling a 1.25 million pound load how cool is that now if you're not sad already uh you know from being disappointed that it only took 1875 pound force in order to move this thing uh you're about to get more sad so here we go let's take that train we're gonna take it off those railroad tracks we're gonna put it on pneumatic tires so road car tires and we're gonna stick it on a real road and so now instead of this .0015 our coefficient of rolling resistance is point zero one five so the force required in order to pull it is multiplied by ten so now we need an eighteen thousand seven hundred fifty pound force in order to move this this 1.25 million pounds on the road and unfortunately our maximum here is basically just going to be the weight of the truck itself so if you load it up with a ton of stuff you might be able to do it but as is this f-150 is very far away from this 18 750 number so it would not even be able to budge that train if it was sitting on a road on road tires now realistically as tire pressures go up which you would need to do if you had a crazy high load like 1.25 million pounds then the frictional coefficient or the rolling resistance coefficient is going to decrease and so as a result of that decreasing coefficient of rolling resistance this number will be less but even if you were to chop that in by a third then you would be at six to fifty pounds so if you had a coefficient rolling resistance a point zero zero five instead of .015 one-third of that you still don't have enough force in order to do it you could throw some sandbags in the back hopefully you've got enough torque you know put a thousand pound payload in there and you might be able to make it work uh but the unfortunate news here is if you were to do this realistically this number right here uh means you could not pull that 1.25 million pounds on a road now here's what i think is the most mind-blowing thing about all of this in the video ford states that they are traveling at 4.5 miles per hour so that got me wondering how much power is actually needed in order to travel at 4.5 miles per hour with a 1.25 million pound load and so thankfully the equation is pretty simple to find out power we simply multiply force by velocity we've already calculated our force and our velocity is 4.5 miles per hour so if we do that math multiply the force by the velocity we get 16.8 kilowatts or 22.5 horsepower 22.5 horsepower that is all that is needed to maintain a speed of 4.5 miles per hour now to get up to that speed is going to take more power it takes a lot of power to accelerate but in order to maintain that speed of 4.5 miles per hour all that ford f-150 has to put down is 22.5 horsepower to keep that thing moving that is pretty cool so now my question is was it necessary for the f-150 to be electric and certainly it helps that it's electric because electric motors at 0 rpm when that truck isn't even moving it's going to have all of its torque available and be able to start accelerating that giant mass you know at a reasonable rate that's very cool but i think the danger here from a marketing standpoint is that instead of this being a comparison saying hey look what our truck can do your truck can't do this instead it's an illusion where we're saying hey check out what our truck can do yours could also do it so that's the sad news here is this this is not something unique to this electric f-150 i think plenty of vehicles out there whether they're gas diesel whatever tons of vehicles out there could have done this experiment because it was done on a railroad track with steel wheels on a steel rail and that enables you to have this really low force that you're able to pull that mass with so it's a very neat stunt but once you kind of understand it's like everybody could probably do this now i want to talk about the toe strap for a moment because the top comments on this video as i was looking at them they were all saying wow this is an amazing tow strap what in the world how does a tow strap uh capable of pulling such a crazy high load well as we have demonstrated uh within this video the force required in order to start pulling this thing is 1 875 pounds of force so you only need a 2 000 pound toe strap in order to make it work out there's nothing fancy about the toe strap uh pretty much any toe strap out there will probably be able to do it as long as it's rated for at least 2 000 pounds now there's a bunch of other variables out there that are important unfortunately they're just boring so you know in this video i focused on the very exciting one which is that coefficient of rolling resistance which makes this stunt possible but there's all kinds of other reasons why you know an electric ford f-150 is not going to pull 1.25 million pounds first of all if you go on any sort of incline once you're on an incline that train is going backwards that truck is just being dragged along with it second of all you need to have braking and this thing is not going to have the brakes to stop 1.25 million pound mass in fact it was using a tow strap it wasn't directly connected if it were to try to slow down obviously they're having to use the brakes on this uh rather than the truck itself the truck itself is not going to be capable of slowing down that insanely high mass also you're going to need a ton of power in order to be able to accelerate you need an insane amount of cooling if you're going to be making all that power you know you can get the thing moving it's just going to take forever to do it a low force will work it just means you're going to accelerate slowly and then of course the parts durability of everything involved in order to pull a mass that high uh it's going to be quite insane so all of the other variables i think are kind of boring but i feel like worth mentioning so we're throwing them in there at the end thank you all so much for watching if you have any questions or comments of course feel free to leave them below and again i do think it was a very cool idea by ford so props to them for pulling it off
