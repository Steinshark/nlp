just the other day a meme made it to the front 
page of reddit which originated in the math memes   subreddit this is the meme it's a variation on the 
drake format meme where the thing at the top is   what you don't want you're shunning that the thing 
at the bottom is the better version you do want   in this case we're looking at values of the sine 
function for different angles i will say i'm aware   that memes particularly one like this that's been 
around for a couple years now can evolve into a   more ironic sense and occasionally this is used 
to show that the bottom one looks superficially   better but actually isn't however i'm pretty 
sure this was posted in earnest given the title   of the post was isn't it awesome way to learn the 
values to be honest and the whole thing was like   organic marketing for a private tutoring firm 
particularly if you look through the comments   that the original poster was putting below i think 
they were genuinely trying to say this is a better   way to write the values of a sine function and 
surely it is it's got a really nice pattern in it   if you look at the sine values for 0 degrees 30 
45 60 and 90 and you're at the traditional way   the values seem to have nothing to do with 
each other but if you rearrange them all   you get this fantastic sequence that goes from the 
square root of zero on two all the way up to the   square root of four on two and that obviously 
that's what mathematicians love that kind of   unexpected pattern just hiding in plain sight 
and suddenly you see it so i took this meme   and i shared it in a private whatsapp group for 
mathematics communicators and they hated it oh   almost universal a massive wave of dislike and 
disdain if i may for this meme and the reason   they all got so emotional is that the pattern 
in this meme doesn't exist yeah it's not real the major red flag that something 
is a mess here is that a lot of this   is not in simplified form not only that 
it's in arbitrary form i mean who writes   zero as the square root of 0 divided by 2. i 
mean you can have all sorts of crazy equations   put a 0 in there the whole thing equals 0. 
it doesn't give us any additional insight   into the notion of 0 that you can take it 
square root and divide it by 2 and it's still   0. and likewise 1 who writes 1 is the square root 
of 4 divided by 2 i mean it's just it's the square   root of a thing divided by the square root of 
the thing again you can write loads of equations   and divide them by the same thing and get one what 
are we learning and then my poor sine of 30 i mean   a lot of this could be justified if by putting 
it in a more complicated form we were able to   see some kind of interesting pattern get that 
in a moment but now we're just we're just hiding   otherwise interesting values i love sine 30 sine 
30 equals a half it's so good and yet it's now   sine of 30 equals the square root of 1 divided 
by 2 i mean why would you do that to sine 30.   you know what let me show you why the sine of 
30 degrees is so amazing using this geogebra   file made by ben sparks link below so i'm going 
to turn on the sine value which just to recap   as i move this dot around the circle the sine 
value is just how far above the axis it is so   here we're slightly above the axis and so the 
sine value is currently 0.18 and as i move this   all the way around it goes all the way up until 
it's one it's a height of one above the axis   and when i get to 30 degrees which is about there 
so it's like a third of the way give or take   around that quarter you can see it hits a 
half and i love that a third of a quarter   is a half it's so good and then by time we go 
like so we're halfway across or two-thirds up   that all lines up again because of symmetry and 
then you get the point over here and so the whole   nature of sine and angles and circles once you hit 
90 degrees your quarter turn it's one because it's   the top of the circle and when it's zero it's zero 
and it's such a shame to have lost that with the   way they do it and here you're getting way more 
detail so you can see initially the plot is pretty   much a straight line and then by the time you get 
up to the top here then it starts to curl out and   these are all the bits that we've got in um in 
the original meme but why stop there i mean you've   just it's like you've come in part way through the 
straight line and then it's just starting to get   interesting you need to go all the way around look 
at that back down now we get the full symmetry of   back down to zero and then the same thing repeats 
but it's flipped everything's now negative because   we're a negative amount above the axis we're below 
the axis so i can fill in the rest of the sine   wave just a bit let's get that bit over there ah 
and then back and so this for me this is the real   beauty of the sine function these cool values 
and and the nice it makes sense looking at it   geometrically why a third gives you a half and all 
these things so good but yet they've all been lost   we better get some pretty amazing insights 
into the patterns behind the values coming out   of a sine function to justify this reckless 
observation of the true values we all know   and love and sadly we don't this sequence is 
ridiculous for a start you've got random jumps   between the values we go from 0 to 30 and then 
we only go up 15 to 45 and then 60 and 90 we're   what is up with that and there's no nice pattern 
between the results i mean it looks like it   but there isn't they're not multiples of each 
other you're not adding the same amount each time   they look visually similar but there's no i mean 
because of the square root that pesky square root   because of it there is no nice sequence between 
each of these terms that's not the pattern we care   about though is it we don't care about the square 
root or the divide by two it's just the zero   one two three four that's the visually pleasing 
pattern why this image gets shared so i thought   well let's move away the rest of the stuff we 
don't need instead of having the sine of some   angle equals the square root of some number n 
divided by 2 we'll move the 2 to the other side   we'll square both sides and 4 times sine 
squared of theta that's what gives us the 0   1 2 3 4 sequence from the original image for the 
angles that they picked but why just those angles   let's plot all of them so i did i've gone from 
0 to 90 degrees and those horizontal lines are   the whole like the integer values going up to 
four because now we're multiplying it by four   so instead of one we go up to four and any 
continuous function that went from zero to four is   going to go through one two and three in between 
we can just pick those points and there's your   meme and as you can see the line does different 
things in between it's there's nothing interesting   about those points other than they're just where 
it happens to be a whole value and you could argue   you're right they do happen at some slightly 
interesting points but that was more obvious in   the original top version i will concede one point 
though it's nice and symmetric which we didn't   have before before we were looking at a quarter of 
the total wave started straight and then flattened   out whereas now because we've got the square of a 
sine wave which is just another sine wave because   the square of the sine of an angle equals 1 
minus cos twice the angle divided by 2 and that's   regular cos not squared that's a sine wave sine 
squared is a sine but because it's squashed in we   now have half a cycle we go from the bottom curvy 
bit all the way up to the top curvy bit technical   way of describing that which is half of the 
wavelength perfectly symmetric the straight   bit is now in the middle and that's why when 
we had one of those integer lines crossing   right in the middle the other two are the same 
distance in each direction so one's 15 degrees one   way like a third of the rest of it and one's 15 
degrees the other way so even though they're not   nicely spaced you've got 0 and 90 you've got the 
middle one and because of the symmetry the other   ones are the same distance n i mean it's it's 
something so i take back some of what i was saying   about the square root all of that said the square 
roots and the symmetry is not enough to save this   meme it's both a bad mathematical pattern because 
it doesn't actually exist and it's a bad way to   learn those values even in the whatsapp group 
with the other mass communicators when i shared   it someone put in this way of learning the same 
values the same way where you pick the finger   that corresponds to the angle and the square root 
of the number of fingers above and below give you   sine and cos and tan that's a superior way to 
do this if all you want is an opaque terrible   mnemonic with no insight into what's actually 
going on but i want some insight and so i asked   around on that whatsapp group what people think 
the bottom bit of that meme should be if it's just   what's the thing which is better than what 
is at the top what is the version of the top   that we want to embrace and here is what i got 
the first response i got was from katie stackles   who just said the angles should be radians so 
there we are that's a lot better mathematicians   love radians partly because yes you do see some 
extra patterns but largely it's just a purer more   fundamental way to measure the size of an angle 
and actually we can see another pattern now   we've got pi on two pi on three pi on four then 
no pi on five then pi on six why did the original   meme maker take out pi on five or 36 degrees 
as we know it and you can contort that into   the square root of a thing over two except it's 
five minus root five on two that's what happens   if you go away from there very carefully selected 
specific examples up next ben sparks drew this   which is pretty good he did say he was a bit 
rushed and when i spoke to him i was asking   everyone if i could use their submissions he said 
he wanted to add a circle and given we were using   his jojoba file earlier fine we'll put in the 
proper version and that's really nice because now   you're going to see the logic behind where these 
values come from and how the structure and shape   of the wave and the circle change what the 
values are and how they interact with each   other so i think that's really nice and finally 
becky warren sent in two triangles and this is my   personal favorite in fact this is how i remember 
what these values are and if you have to teach   these values just you know if someone has to learn 
them this is the one i recommend because not only   is it easy to remember you just got to sketch 
those two triangles which to this day i still do   but it's not just some arbitrary pattern that's 
a really nice bit of logic and it shows you how   pythagoras links to these values and we've 
got our root 2 and our root 3 the main roots   on display and that's why i think this is 
the ultimate version of this ridiculous meme   well thanks so much for watching the video 
we really appreciate it if you're new here   do subscribe to the channel i want you 
to do that that's a good thing over here   they'll be hugely appreciated and not all the 
videos are ridiculous over analysis of memes   that's a good point all the videos are 
ridiculous in their own separate special   ways so do make sure you check out uh this 
video over here this is also pretty good
