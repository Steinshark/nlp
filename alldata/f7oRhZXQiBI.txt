with the Scandinavian defense the first game both sides Castle life is good now you gotta ease into a match like this there are 45 minutes on the clock so the first game is kikaru putting a little bit of pressure with his Bishops Magnus advancing on the king side looking to create some attacking chances but very quickly he actually loses a pawn and he's a clean Pawn down with Hikaru effortlessly expanding his army and this game is actually over very quickly as before anything serious can happen Magnus resigns he resigns the first match in like 30 seconds and Hikaru jumps out to a one to nothing lead so what does Magnus do in the next game Hikaru plays the system that he plays all the time I mean this is a Sensei who knows a a thing or two and plays the same way for the 10 000th time I'm only afraid of the man that's practiced one kick ten thousand times so Hikaru is playing as modern Magnus is playing in a way where he's going to put some question marks onto the queen side Hikaru mobilizing and now we have a queenless middle game Magnus wins a pawn and he's asking hey Carl what are your pieces doing over there he's got the Bishops he takes tactics flying all over the place it's a complicated position but Magnus has a very strong 10 second lead Hikaru gets the bishop to C5 massive tactical complications and we go to an end game Magnus is up in exchange he transforms the position where he's got a bishop and two pawns for a rook and it's just a matter of a Scramble now 30 seconds versus 19. time ticking pawns flying up the board look at Magnus approaching is he is he getting mated is the pawn sneaking through it is and Magnus Strikes Back In emphatic fashion it's a rook end game it's bullet it's chaos 5 Seconds 4 seconds time is ticking he cars to and Hikaru in the time scramble losing The Rook but it was already very difficult a move ago wasn't difficult there but as time scrambles go Magnus strikes back immediately but Hikaru opens up quickly he plays a Vienna he doesn't play Queen G4 by the way it would have been really nice if Hikaru could play Queen G4 but we just have a regular opening no Bishops Hikaru advancing it's an even match they threaten us with a repetition of moves but we're not getting one Hikaru once again threatening us with a repetition now we just have a bishopless game these guys hate Bishops Hikaru grabs upon we go to another end game Queen E5 and hikaru's just two clean pawns up healthy clean pawns up Hikaru has made 35 moves in 18 seconds how is that even possible he's not pre-moving every move is just happening so fast and I got news for you he's just very effortlessly marches Magnus down and obliterates him in the third decisive game of the match Hikaru is now up a game and I got bad news for you my friends if you are cheering for Magnus Hikaru was Rock Solid early he just won that game with the white pieces now he has to hold serve with black it's exactly like tennis it's exactly like in tennis the person with white is the one serving if you break in tennis life is going to be good take stock at this position take stock of this position Hikaru up two pawns Magnus takes and is trying to draw The Rook end game but let me tell you something right now it is not easy look at he sorrow Galloping across the board of this King like a gazelle in a field F5 the Pawns of passer and my friends it takes 53 moves but Hikaru gets the job done and takes an early two-game lead now obviously not a big deal yet don't have to stress just yet right next time Magnus got the white pieces he didn't just play every game with white they had some draws Magnus still trailing by two Hikaru keeps going back to the modern this time Magnus is going straight at him all right massive advancement in the center Knight to D5 Bishop takes tactics all over the board but Hikaru once again escaping from the opening with a fantastic position C4 now Hikaru is the one calling the shots but a very messy position and if Magnus can get the pawns rolling uh-oh uh oh oh the entire safety of the king is now threatened F6 Knight F7 Knight d8 Magnus has won an exchange takes Rook D5 but Hikaru with the world's best defender easily the world's best defender rookie five Queen D5 though he's trying to create counter play but it's just not fast enough Queen F7 E7 and that is gonna do it magnet is promoting to a second Queen and Magnus is within one again now Hikaru next game with white Magnus playing a French defense we have a really weird queenless middle game remember Hikaru up by one listen to me all right let it fuel you we have a night bishop and Rook middle game very symmetrical structure overall whoever can win a game like this in a match like this is going to win the match the players were firing off moves Hikaru targeted the F Pawn hikaru's also got a past h-pawn Magnus meanwhile trying to trade as many pieces off and stabilize the position very very messy and Tangled tactical situation rookie three take Stakes Rook F6 and Hikaru makes it into a winning rook and Bishop end game and my God how quickly he won H5 King D4 Bishop F5 Rook H7 and it was just a matter of time until Bishop E4 came Magnus was pre-moving because he was down half of hikaru's time and Hikaru takes a two-game lead and it got even worse because in the very next game Hikaru took a three-game lead so Hikaru is up three games versus Magnus three points he's got a three game lead okay at this point of the video how many minutes are we in like eight it's a three-game lead this is really bad Magnus is now tilting okay we have E4 Knight F6 Magnus going for an ayokin's defense but we just go back to a Four Knights D4 take take Scotch Bishop B6 all right Bishop G5 hit remember he corals up three games and I got really bad news for you Magnus is about to land himself into another very very dangerous position so it's a three-game lead for Hikaru and a winning position on the board after the opening Knight F6 Bishop H4 and Hikaru just puts his Queen out there how is Magnus gonna defend his King he's got a ruined structure Here Comes rookie one he tries to fight back but we have this this C5 Agnes's Bishop is trapped this is unbelievable Hikaru is going to take a four game lead how is that possible okay Rook d8 Bishop takes G6 why because after this Hikaru takes Magnus goes here Desperado to sack the bishop Rook D1 hikaru's up a bishop Hikaru traded and played C4 C5 purely trapped Magnus suspicious Magnus tried to go for counter play in a tactical Skirmish Hikaru has a four game lead he is up four games against Magnus in the bullet Championship time is ticking well Magnus is going to strike back Magnus magazine just sit there and get steamrolled four game deficits he eats that for breakfast or lunch or dinner or five o'clock tea I don't know what they do in Norway Hikaru back to the true and tried you cannot stop this man from playing a modern Beard's defense this man knows this opening better than stockfish not true that's gas E5 take take C3 Queen E7 all right Bishop G5 take take Magnus Knight D2 looking for the light squares looking for the light squares Queen to B5 But Here Comes Hikaru kicking out the queen all right Hikaru rotating the night back around Knight D6 all right the Queen's looking a little bit dicey over there Queen E6 Magnus is like no problem let's trade okay Rook to C1 Knight G4 it's an equal end game it's Rook at night but Knight uh-oh uh oh how are you gonna defend yourself active Knight Here Comes C5 hikaru's instigating Hikaru is instigating with B5 King D3 Pawn takes oh that is a nasty looking pin how do you deal with that Rook dhek Knight into D4 this is a terrifying position Knight C2 G5 oh no Magnus had to play King to D3 but he goes here he's booted and Hikaru is up at night he's up at night and he's up eight seconds could this could this be possible Knight E3 back Magnus rookies oh my goodness Hikaru is going to win again Rook h8 Rook H3 Rook F3 Rook A3 and he's gonna push his Jeep on and Magnus Carlson resigns Magnus Carlson is now officially down five games to Hikaru Hikaru is decimating decimating the best player in the world well that's kind of fitting because he's number two all right this is unreal there is no coming back from this no amount of games that Magnus is going to win is going to be good enough because Hikaru is going to be right there can Hikaru bury Magnus and completely erase any doubt and any debate that he is by far the best bullet player in the world we're about to find out the players made a couple of draws and in the very next game we're about to find out if Magnus is going to begin his comeback or dig himself a deeper hole E4 from Hikaru Magnus starts firing away early with H5 H4 hikaru's Knight gets booted H3 and E5 confidence Central play takes on E3 so that he can put a bishop on G4 Hikaru getting himself into a bit of an uncomfortable situation here Magnus just needs a moment opposite side castling is he going to start an attack F5 he takes F5 but Magnus was not going to take the pawn back and in an equal position Hikaru had to play Queen F3 or Bishop E3 he plays Pawn takes F5 and Magnus says psych that's the wrong number Queen to G2 is an Unstoppable mate and Against All Odds Magnus is now only down four games this is unbelievable stuff could he possible no surely not he's gonna get within three he's gonna get within two but then Hikaru is gonna flip it all around he's up five games damn it there's no way right well good thing we've got a couple of more games today Hikaru going back to the true and tried Magnus looking to build a little bit of momentum he's been dormant the first 30 minutes of this match remember 45 minutes of one oh chess you have to win by two Magnus is down four games rookie one castles H3 all right Hikaru playing the usual Bishop on B7 all right what's Magnus gonna do he closes up the center taking up some space trying to restrict Hikaru Hikaru plays C6 Queen C7 King H7 Rock Solid come and get me I'm up for games Bozo who said you were the best in the world Rook C1 C5 it's a deadlocked position all Magnus has is this he's got this area of the board A and B maybe something over here Bishop C2 Knight B6 Knight D7 Here Comes Magnus Rook A4 H5 poking holes asking questions Hikaru now looking to create a little bit of counter play Knight takes A4 Magnus knocking on the door and in this position Magnus finds Knight danger she shakes the defense of the black king an absolute illusion as nobody can account for knight uh excuse me can I count for this and queen H5 so that is why Hikaru had to play Knight F6 Knight H4 Magnus escapes robs the robs the bunkers Knight to F5 Queen F3 and it's a juggernaut Bishop H6 Bishop H6 Hikaru has the defend his Knight the bishop comes back the queen is coming the Knight is coming queen g3 at some point all of magnus's other pieces are gonna come in can Hikaru make any sort of comeback no he loses the Rook but Magnus is trailing on the clock no he's not G4 Rook C1 time scramble Rook D6 Rook C6 take all the pawns and there we go the pawn sneaks in Magnus slowing down here only down to six seconds on the clock can Hikaru flank him the answer no King F6 and Hikaru resigns and Magnus is now within three games and at this moment in the match one of the most insane streaks occurred they proceeded to draw the next four games deadlocked Hikaru maintains a three-game lead there are now about 10 minutes remaining they've got at most time for five games maybe six and it's win by two if they don't win by two they play overtime at this point they drew a bunch of games now this end game oh this was unbelievable stuff all right this was Magnus is either gonna get within two or Hikaru is going to take the dirt out of the cemetery and bury the coffin this is the critical game E4 it's a it's a Vienna Knight A5 takes the bishop Hikaru develops Knight to G3 it's a pure Vienna Magnus shreds open the center of the board this is the closest it's been in 25 minutes Magnus is within three games can he make it two queen B7 Hikaru up a pawn but he's gonna lose that one and he's gonna lose that one takes this is the position Magnus is completely winning but Hikaru is creating counter play on the light squares Knight F6 Queen F3 can Magnus find it within himself D2 oh my goodness oh my goodness Here Comes Magnus the pawn is being defended Magnus looking for counter play Rook B3 Rook D2 pieces flying off the board it's a rook end game here it comes Magnus is building the advantage the best end game player literally in human history pushes the white king off to the edge of the board with Rook to A2 check and he's winning he has worked his magic he is even up on time Hikaru dead lost E2 wait a minute that was the wrong approach you had to play Rook F2 you had to maintain that this King cannot come back because if you play Rook F2 and then E2 you bring your king and then you win but he plays this and kikoro escapes against all no way out and now the game ends in a king and pawn end game draw the defensive Savant that is Hikaru stands up against Magnus in the end game and maintains a three-game lead you cannot script the stuff this is Sensational stuff are you enjoying this recap you better enjoy this recap take a moment right now write a comment about how much you're enjoying this recap I'm gonna take a sip of my espresso as if I need any more oh my goodness my friends it is a three-game lead Magnus Carlson has to win at least two games he has to get within one he doesn't have to tie the match he just has to not lose by two that is the rule here we go E4 can he do it yet again we see Hikaru playing this type of fusion modern uh Pierce opening we've seen a lot of these different Transformations we are not going to do a deep analysis it's an end game the best end game player in the world by extension the best middle to end game player in the world Rooks are off Knight C4 Knight A5 going for a journey Knight takes B7 oh my goodness Knight A5 and I think Hikaru just completely did not anticipate this or decides to Gambit the pawn to try to create counter play but my friends all I have to say here is the following Rook A6 what pawn is the most important Pawn that white has which of Magnus Carlson's pawns is his greatest asset is it a c e f g or H there's only one answer the a pawn it's an outside pass Pawn which is a billion dollar unicorn startup when it comes to the end game and watch and learn A4 A5 A6 this is not rocket science this is the equivalent of Uno The King The Rook slide out of the way he doesn't care that he's going to lose the bishop because A8 Queen ladies and gentlemen this is officially the closest that match has been in about 15 games Magnus Carlson is within two but that is still a long way to go and my man Hikaru my man when all hope was lost decided to slow the whole thing down play for a sicilian slightly imbalanced opening and says you know what I was up five I was up four I was up three I was up two my time is ticking time is ticking down to zero Magnus is going to rightfully reclaim his throne look at this fantastic position that Magnus has built but Hikaru resilient for a reason snags upon gives up this Rook to D7 Queen to E4 oh God oh my goodness Magnus Carlson on the verge of making it a one-game lead but slightly Knight to E3 apparently was winning but he plays this Queenie 2 takes takes Hikaru kicks out his queen queen to G5 and then he just grabs the pawn Magnus plays Rook C1 his Advantage is gone his Advantage is gone Knight to E3 Queen D2 Knight G4 oh my goodness oh my goodness it is Hikaru Knight C6 winning the pawn on the queen side past Pawn we just saw Magnus win with a pass ball now kikaru is going to win with the passbomb this is unbelievable stuff King f8 A4 Hikaru cruising to a three-game lead when he plays this move blunders a fork and the game is now back to a draw but not for long because in this position Magnus plays F6 check he had anticipated that after Knight here Hikaru would go here not forward and he pre-moves this loses his pawn and resigns as hikaru's got the a pawn the infiltration and Hikaru my friends is now up three games with seven minutes remaining seven minutes you do the math both sides have one minute to start a bullet game that's two minutes there are seven minutes remaining on the clock every single game now counts if Magnus Carlson loses this game the video is over the bullet Chess Championship is over and Hikaru is the champion E4 but if Magnus wins this game Hikaru only has a two-game lead now we have Bishop to D3 yet again we have this E5 we have very similar position that we've had and here comes a queenless middle game Bishop to E6 Here Comes H5 by Hikaru maintaining a little bit of central space on this side Knight to D7 Knight G5 Magnus has the two Bishops and guess what guess what Magnus is like an Italian sculptor all he needs is a little bit and then the genius will unfold Bishop to C4 Rook to E7 Rook D1 a4a5 slight steady Improvement of the position Bishop F2 Hikaru tries to lock it all down with H4 it's just a matter of time here comes Pawn to B4 take take Bishop D4 but Hikaru is a genius on his own right and he builds up an impenetrable Fortress at this point Magnus could have played Bishop takes H4 he missed it he played Rook to C2 Rook C1 and my friends with seven minutes remaining on the game clock we got to the following position opposite colored Bishops 20 seconds for Magnus 25 seconds for Hikaru what you do in a game like this is you bleed the clock this is a dead draw this is a dead draw but with a timer remaining you gotta play it on Hikaru now takes the pawn and keeps the game going Hikaru cannot that easily win this game he cannot just play King C3 because after King E5 there is this I'm gonna take the pawns and I'm going to advance and I'm going to sacrifice the bishop so the players Shuffle tensions are at a sky high level look at the position 14 seconds to 16 seconds they shuffle a little bit more and Hikaru makes a run for it 9 seconds versus 9.7 King E5 King G2 King F4 King H3 Pawn push check King F5 King H2 oh my goodness white is winning F4 oh my goodness Magnus is winning H3 but Magnus accidentally blunders into a drawn end game but he's still up two and a half seconds on the clock King G4 F5 it's a draw it's a draw and Hikaru loses upon Magnus is winning once again Magnus is winning once again King to F7 it's a drug and he plunder the pawn but he sneaks them through and 89 moves later Magnus Carlson wins he wins he wins he's only down two games this is unreal now there are four minutes remaining it's a two-game match if Hikaru wins this game it's over there is no way that mathematically Magnus can make a comeback D5 takes takes oh my goodness H5 Bishop C4 Knight F1 we have G3 we have Knight to E3 D3 and Hikaru gets himself into a load of trouble all right a load of trouble here he gets completely barricaded on the light squares look at this this is nuts the momentum is officially just skyrocketing in magnus's favor the light squared bind Hikaru goes for a defensive Queen sacrifice to relinquish the pressure in the position but Magnus now starts firing away on the other side of the board and even though kikaru has created a good blockade rookie 8 and once Magnus removes one Rook from the board the other Rook that Hikaru has loses a ton of its value G5 Queen F7 Queen F3 Queen G2 and for the second time in this match hikaru's King is mated on the light squares by force the dark squared Bishop just an onlooker of the light squared barricade Magnus is within one oh my God oh my God Magnus Carlson is within one game E4 we have yet another Sicilian Defense this is not Magnus has not been within one in something like 20 games if Hikaru wins this game the match is over Bishop to C4 Knight E5 take take Queen C7 Here Comes Hikaru look at this fantastic position oh my goodness look at this position that he's gotten what a sensational position pass Pawn on the D file opposite side castling Rook sneaks into D3 but Hikaru asking so many nasty questions it's a heavy piece endgame Brooks and queens Queen to D7 Queen C7 if Hikaru wins this game he wins the match Queen C5 Queen C3 Here Comes Hikaru rotating his Queen around Rook D3 building up the pressure but oh Magnus lost the pawn but he's going here would be one but magnus's King now opens up magnus's King is opening up Queen to E3 the game is on a knife such I mean I have absolutely no idea what's going on Queen C5 now it's a winning end game Hikaru pushes the pawn but suddenly Magnus stops IT Rook end game Rook D6 Rook DC oh my goodness Magnus is winning but he's down six seconds it's a rook end game but if Magnus loses this game on the oh no Hikaru rookie six oh nine seconds 14 seconds Rook before Rook takes before Rook takes B4 and kikaru loses and the magic side and not only does Magnus Carlson win and the match is tied they start the final game of Regulation with two seconds on the clock this game counts but there are two seconds on the clock and this was one of the most deranged insane high pressure games I've ever seen in my life the match is tied Magnus has overcome All Odds to come back from being Five Points down that is what you call Goat shite okay King H7 this is the position Magnus roaring forward here Bishop versus knight it's an end game it's hanging on a knife's edge Queen to C4 he's sneaking around here comes Pawn to C3 oh my goodness Queen A8 check Queen E4 check and Knight F6 Magnus Carlson is going to take his first lead in the match but he misses it rugby two and suddenly Hikaru is creating opportunities the player's Shuffle moves back and forth Magnus trades Rook to the eight King here it's looking like it's supposed to be game over but the king is escaping the king is escaping and Magnus who just a moment ago had Queen A8 here Knight F6 and was just a moment away from winning this game Rook D1 Queen A8 Queen A8 Queen F7 just completely picking up all the Pawns has to settle for a repetition of moves and we go to overtime oh my God it's 1414 as Magnus Carlson has come back from down five my friends this is how overtime works the players have six games if at any point one of them takes a two-game lead they win Agnes has not LED in this match but he has also trailed by five and now he is in a tight situation Hikaru locks the center the center is now completely locked and here comes Hikaru attacking Magnus Knight back to G3 the king slides out of the way Rook to G1 and pawn to H4 this is one of the most monstrous attacks that's building that I've ever seen and Magnus meets him right there FG HG attacks blocks infiltrates counter play Queen slides up Knight rotates Bishop C1 covering the F4 Square Bishop infiltrates on the dark squares takes takes magnus's overtaking Hikaru it is a tied match Rook B1 locks the door C3 trades the Bishops the Knight lives on the F4 Square Magnus Carlson positional masterclass all of hikaru's pieces are now restricted Magnus plays Rook to B8 and dominates on that file Rook to B1 the advantage is skyrocketing for Magnus Carlson Knight takes D3 is game over if takes Queen A2 check is a Haymaker from the gods if you play Queen takes D3 you simply lose the Rook Magnus Carlson is winning Magnus Carlson is winning for the first time in this match but he plays Rook to B2 which is still a very decent move but now kikaru plays the ugly stubborn Rook C1 Magnus is still winning plays Queen takes A2 Hikaru rotates up Bishop A4 Rook A1 Bishop C2 the game is over Queen H1 from Hikaru Bishop takes D3 wait what about the queen why did Magnus not Save the Queen he didn't save the queen because after this this this he just assumed he's winning the pawn is promoting kikaru had one of the worst positions that he had had in an hour and he flipped it All Around by sacrificing his Knight and stopping magnus's Pawn the other worldly defensive abilities to be stretched this thin with a king that has no legal moves to sacrifice your night rotate the queen this way and the unmitigated Gall to not even save this game my friends Hikaru wins this game he wins Queen E5 Magnus Carlson was completely utterly winning he could not have been more winning look at the position it was the pieces were on opposite sides of the board and he was down multiple ponds kikaru wins this game you you can't make this stuff up Magnus is going to tilt off the face of the planet yet again we have E5 Hikaru going for the same type of setup I am going to be sick to my stomach I don't know how Magnus is not sick to his stomach from that game that was otherworldly I mean how did Hikaru not lose that game how did Hikaru win that game Bishop D3 but now Magnus goes to work Rook C1 Queen C2 Rook B4 infiltrates with his Queen pinning Hikaru and Hikaru hangs a knight the nerves must have been through the roof kikaru hangs a knight continues the game for a little while the whole thing is reset ladies and gentlemen it's tight again 15 15. 1515. are you enjoying yourselves because I am enjoying myself my friends the match is 15-15 they've got four more games to decide what's going to happen it's okaro Khan from Magnus Carlsen he plays Bishop G4 E6 and Hikaru pushes out his Queen plays E5 and G4 Magnus goes here take take C5 Knight C6 Rook CA Queen B6 Hikaru walks the king to G2 a very tense position as Magnus goes for a queenless middle game and infiltrates on the C4 square and once again Magnus is doing very very well with the white pieces but Hikaru is just he's just the most stubborn Defender I have ever seen in my life it's another queenless middle game but Magnus is better B6 take take no Bishops Rooks and knights Magnus tries to poke with F6 takes takes Magnus still trying to take advantage E5 Knight D3 Knight into D2 the pieces are all tied together how is he car not losing a rook he is he gives away a rook to take here Rook C to what D4 Magnus is completely winning King to G3 Knight to A5 Magnus is completely winning I mean the game is over he's up in exchange and he has multiple pass pawns Rook to D7 there's no way oh my goodness he lost the pawn wait but the king steps back Rook C7 that's it the game is over Rook C5 Rook B2 magician magician you can take this but then I'm gonna get both of those wait a minute now Magnus is doubting himself Rook B4 Here Comes Magnus Rook B1 but oh my goodness Hikaru in with Rook B6 King F4 Knight F3 G5 is Chicago going to win this game is he going to win this game on time he better he better not he better not win this game on Time Rook h no no rookie Rook A6 H4 Rook A5 that five seconds each Magnus down to four seconds it's a nasty scramble he correspond advancing King H6 904 G7 Roots okay five check Magnus Carlson loses on time Magnus Carlson loses on time for the second time in the overtime he had a dominant position but the ridiculous tenacity of Hikaru 16-15 if Hikaru wins this game it's all over if Magnus wins this game it's 16-16 there was a winner somebody won this game E5 Hikaru with the black pieces this time we have the exact same opening we've had Magnus doing it the exact same way that he's done it non-stop take take looking to infiltrate on the queen side looking to infiltrate with H4 like he's done the entire match Hikaru trying to bully him getting him out of the position Bishop to C2 Magnus opening up the position tactics flying all over the board Bishop d8 Queen d8 very dangerous position for white very dangerous position for black 40 seconds each 95 oh my God Hikaru grabbed the pawn oh my God hikaru's night is going on a journey Knight to D1 check Queen takes E4 he's completely chucked the bishop Queen E3 check Magnus can make a draw here but Hikaru takes oh my God he checks him again into another check into another check Queen C1 Queen F4 the game is going to end in a draw right unless somebody blunders C4 and that somebody is Magnus despite being up a full Bishop in a queen end game the weakness of his King allows Hikaru to do this and by some sort of cruel fate of geometry Hikaru is threatening Queen D2 and C2 and he delivers it and he's going to make a second Queen he defends himself gives a check C1 Queen is Unstoppable Magnus Carlson resigns Hikaru is the bullet Chess World Champion 2023 with a final score line of 17-15 decided in overtime win by two after trailing excuse me winning the match by five games losing a game at a time as Magnus chiseled away Magnus was down three games with seven minutes to go in regulation he tied the match Magnus was winning multiple times in the overtime to take the lead in the match Hikaru defended and he wins 17-15 I got nothing else to say you're a returning viewer thanks for watching this far if you've never watched
