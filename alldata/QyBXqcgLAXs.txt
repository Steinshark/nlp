there is an immediate reflex in many people's minds now to shut down as soon as one mentions religion um and in this country which is a godless country compared with america no doubt canada if you ask people do they belong to religion about 13 of them say that they do um so 87 are not but if you ask people do you think there's more to this life and to this world than is accounted for in the reductionist materialist picture 95 percent of them say yes so people are missing something extremely powerful and what is wonderful in what you said and i completely endorse and have written about in a number of places is this idea of being attracted forwards to something that we wish to imitate and it's in complete contrast to the mechanistic universe in which we are to play things of causality this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world [Applause] all right and so um before we start maybe uh i would i think that i would really like to most of your interviews i've seen have been very much about the brain and about the left right uh hemispheres but when i i read i haven't read your recent book i read that his master the and the mathematician um you can be forgiven for not reading the latest one rather long but so the the the a large part of the book does discuss uh art and art history and you know culture and i think of course that's the aspect of your work that interests me the most and so if you're okay yes i think we will talk about i mean obviously we will touch on on on the brand difference but i will focus mostly on the the question of culture and the problem of something like the the problem of alienation of the modern of the modern experience and and how you how you try to trace that through history and everything and you'll see we probably have some similarities and differences in the way we kind of we see it and so hopefully it'll be an interesting discussion no that's fine um i should just mention that the new book uh doesn't have much in the way of cultural history in it because i felt i'd done that one instead what it is is um an unpacking of the philosophical consequences of two bits of our brain as it were giving us a different phenomenological world to live in and so if we're asking questions of truth like what you know who are we i start this new book with platinus's question but we who are we because i feel we've completely lost any sense of what a human being is what the world is like and how we relate to it so if one's going to answer those questions then the question of which one of the hemispheres is telling us something we can rely on better becomes important and i just unpacked that so a lot of things that you are very interested in i deal with in part three of the new book things like consciousness matter values sense of the sacred um and all those things well maybe we can we can actually start there then because i think one of the biggest effects that your your book has had and your influence has been to reverse the the reverse the hierarchy of what is prime primordial in terms of what it is to be human and what it is to be to have a human experience in some ways it kind of overturns the the reductive scientific vision that we've that we've lived with on and off i guess since enlightenment there's a competition it seems between different visions but definitely that's the one that seems to have pervaded popular culture you know this kind of reductive aspect idea that we're that we are almost just machines basically you know soft machines or something like that but you really have been able to bring about the the primacy of consciousness and the the embedded experience as being something uh you you constantly emphasize the notion of of context and how things of into the interrelation of things and that is how we actually experience our the richest part of our experiences in that so you can start a little bit with that and we can move on to the art and culture a bit afterwards absolutely we can start anywhere and go anywhere that you like i mean of course it's very nice of you to say that i've affected some sort of a shift but of course i'm just part of a lot of people who've got rather um tired of being served up this incredibly simple-minded idea the reductionist materialist position um and so i'm very glad to be part of a movement for something a bit more sophisticated and more likely to be true um but you you touch there on a very important point of context because it seems to me that context is everything it completely changes the meaning of what one's dealing with um the context of a word alone can make it mean something quite different but all the things that are really most powerful for us things like the sense of the divine of nature of love poetry music and the rest can't easily be just made into explicit sentences in um in prose the only way we can approach them using language seems to me to be obliquely definitely and the there is you know the the way that i that i like to approach it is there is a sense in which analogy is the basic mechanism by which we understand or the way we engage yes and so analogy has this play between identity and difference like there's this constant play where you see the pattern and but you also notice the difference dionysus the aria guide really talks about analogy as he pulls it into god into these two extremes you know of of complete apophatic difference but then also fullness of of of participation you could say and so you use the word metaphorical at least in the book that i read you you tend to use the word metaphor in terms of of that process yes yes i think it's a reasonable one because the metaphor is which one is saying something like he is a lion and interestingly it depends on the fact that he's not a lion if he was it would be a very pronounced um but the whole point of a metaphor is that you are bringing together two things that are simultaneously true in one way and not true in another and and i would entirely agree that metaphors or models and models of just sort of more elaborated metaphors govern how we think about things and are behind what we mean when we say oh i understand that including in science so when people say they understand something i think what this means is that they can approximate it in their minds to something else that they already know and think that they can believe so it's really always an analogy as it were but the analogy is interesting because of the difference as well and what i particularly am concerned about is that when one uses a model such as a machine to liken anything you make it look machine like only the bits that correspond to a machine stand out and all the rest retires into the sort of dark into the penumbra but those are the things we really need to be attending to otherwise all we do see is the confirmation of our own model yeah and i don't know if you thought a little bit about the obsession with artificial intelligence at this moment and in in i seem to notice exactly what you're saying is that the our obsession with the technical with computers with artificial intelligence is actually transforming the manner in which we see ourselves we tend to instead of although we phrase it as trying to notice the resemblance between artificial intelligence and human intelligence there's a manner in which we've reduced the human being to you know aggregation of information we've reduced the human being to being a kind of dictionary and uh and and we've reduced consciousness to what it is that we can see on google that's error the man in which we engage with our machines i don't know if you've noticed that in in terms of the shift in the way people see the human person oh i have very much yes and i suppose 20 or 30 years ago um cognitive psychologists were consulted about ways in which one could try and make a machine smarter by making it like a person but nowadays the emphasis is how can we make persons smarter by making them more like machines unfortunately we won't make them smarter and all around me i see the evidence of what i'd call artificial stupidity which is the reduction of human intelligence and so i want to ask you my biggest the biggest question i want to ask you i want to get into the cultural question and i think that you know when i read uh the master and emissary i think for me it was it was a very intense experience because it was the type of intense experience that you get from coming close to someone very very close but then also also noticing things that that that how can i say this it's like i wanted to get into a fight with you reading that book and that really happens like but i wanted to get into a fight with you the way that i would fight with my spouse or with my good friend because you know it was like he's like oh you know sometimes i feel like he's coming he's right he's there he's there and then i'm like no no not that not that not that not that so that's the feeling that i got and the biggest sense that that for example i mean i i love so much of it but the biggest scent the thing that i want to bring up to you no hoping that you know how much i appreciated and loved it was what i found to be the profound a profound misunderstanding of the middle ages like to me that was a because if you know my work you know that it is steep very much in the medieval vision and and all the time when you were talking about the dark ages i thought oh there's a something of of like i understand the kind of enlightenment uh line that we have this this vision of what the the the middle ages brought but uh but i i felt like there was a deep misunderstanding and maybe if i can phrase it the misunderstanding maybe you can what i thought is a misunderstanding maybe you can you can maybe untangle it for me or help me understand it's there's a sense in which you know you talk about this idea of conte of context and of into of integrated meaning how we gather meaning from all these related intermoving parts and so you know the the the left brain tends to want to isolate and to to focus and to you know to name and to kind of contain and the image you use is the the representation of the face in through the ages one of the images you use and when you come to the middle ages or to the more to to the end of the roman empire and and toward the middle ages you you la you see the lack of the personal let's say in the face and to me there's something about that which i i feel like actually the crystallization of expression of human expression is very scientific there's a there's a there's a very precise science to crystallizing an expression whereas i feel like the mimetic aspect of the face is something that we imitate through the face that is we imitate the this this emotional transformation that we feel in the other we actually imitate it through our own faces we don't imitate it by through a pen we imitate it this way and so but when we come to imitate nature with a pen we have to imitate nature within the space that we're imitating and so the mimetic aspect of medieval arc is a good example would be a medieval manuscript where you have in the center of the image something highly focused and highly orthodox so you have an image of the enunciation for example and then you will have some let's say flexibility in that image as well but as you move towards the margin then you find all the wonder and idiosyncrasy that would be in the margins of our of our perception but would also would be just in the this kind of metamorphosis uh that you find in inovated all of these these types of transformational beings that you see and so when you go into medieval manuscripts you look to the borders you find every single possible imaginative thing you can think of every idiosyncrasy inversions humor you know body humor uh even you know and so i felt like there's a sense in which in order to truly understand medieval art we have to understand it always contextually itself and so a medieval sculpture doesn't exist on its own it exists in a church it exists with the you know within an architectural meteor within the participation of a person and so a good another example would be like memento mori in the medieval mind wouldn't have been let's say a highly uh you know highly whimsical use of anamorphosis in in in holbein's skull for example but would be the actual skull of a saint that you would kiss and that you would venerate and that you would come to you know and so there's a sense in which that is what i think that that's where i found it difficult in terms of the middle ages which is that the the way to understand medieval life in medieval is through the liturgy not so much for the art it's through the life of the people and once and if you look at ritual and you look at celebrations and you look at that then you find something which i feel was much closer to the i the this kind of ideal world of of connected participation and and uh anyway so that's the that is that i think that was the biggest thing that i felt when i was reading your book was like i totally agree with your conclusion but i felt like in terms of the the images you used there were some that i disagreed with i could feel easy go ahead go ahead go ahead and knock me down i'm totally comfortable no no not at all it's not it's it's absolutely not i hope a matter of anyone knocking anybody down um and and interestingly uh uh you know i would not differ from i can't think of anything you said really that i wouldn't really accept um certainly i think the way in which we we understand another person including their face and so forth is not by a matter of decoding signals but by a matter of inhabiting if you like so that we we feel our way into what it is like for this person um and so i completely agree about that because that's a timeless remark it has nothing to do with movements in the history of ideas it's simply how we do the business of empathizing but what i was uh talking about was the different ways in which um the history of ideas has taken cataclysmic turns and i suppose uh i i absolutely love um very much that comes out of the middle ages and indeed it was at my school which which was in a mid 14th century um school uh with a 14th century cloister and church and so on that i first in that inhabited way um the reality of that medieval world and its music and its poetry and so on which i studied so all of that i completely accept but my my point was not to try and survey the entirety of um the history but to look at the big crisis points and i think that the middle ages i mean they can be seen as being very different from the foregoing centuries but effectively after the fall of rome and through to the early renaissance there was something entirely continuous going on and it's with the renaissance that one sees a big shift and so i'm interested in those big shifts because i think they're associated with hemispheric shifts um but it this has nothing to do with um disparagement and while i think it's true that to look for the expression of the medieval soul one might look literally rather than in art per se that in itself tells you something um because i wouldn't necessarily say that was true of the renaissance i mean there were wonderful things to do with the liturgy going on continuously but but not in quite that way um and i love the the the great business of the medieval mind is is the seeing of the multiplicity of things there's a tendency once one moves on in time to try and um make everything consonant but there's something rather wonderful about the suggestion of rampant individualization in the medieval mind and all the detail and fascinating little jokes that are in the sculpture and in the in the manuscripts you mentioned uh memento mori and i i thought of this if you don't know it i have to pass this on and a wonderful marginal remark by a french monk who is transcribing something and you know there is this uh moralizing saying have death in front of your eyes and said with a french accent this sounds like abe oculis and that can be read as the abbot is dead in a field and the lily is growing out of his ass so he he the scribe actually draws the abbey prone in the field with the lily coming out of his house so i i think this is totally wonderful one can bring in every kind of imagination including the humerus there so i don't think that i'm somehow down on the richness of it but i do think that the emotional expression in the face at least in the west during the middle ages um was not anything remotely like what came afterwards and i say in the west because as you know in the master in his chemistry um i i use that extraordinary image of christ and his mother from the savior and horror church in in constantinople now istanbul um and that was what twelfth century but yes an amazing thing yes yeah there was i mean there was in the byzantine world but there was the thing about the western medieval spirit is that it's so difficult to contain you know because what was happening in spain what was happening in northern france was actually quite different we tend to homogenize it but there's actually quite a lot of variability but it's true that there was a moment in the byzantine towards the end of the byzantine empire where there was this high emotionalism which which kind of brought was brought into the church and the high expressive uh use almost caricatural you know uh facial expressions and and in that church in particular yeah definitely um and so i think that that that for me but i i think that the the in terms of because there's okay so so let me bring it back to the other part which i think related to the renaissance as well because in the renaissance what we have is highly expressive things but which become more and more passive in terms of the viewer and so the the the development of opera the development of ballet the development of all these arts which are wonderful and beautiful they actually bring the viewer into a position of of of just passive aesthetic contemplation and although you can have internal emotions while you're you're you're watching as at first maybe the opera there was some participation you're allowed to scream at the at the opera maybe throw things if you were annoyed um but it gradually was moving towards what we have now which is the concert hall which you sit and watch whereas the let's say the that's why i i wanted to bring out the liturgical part which is that the the liturgical aspect is always participative right the processions the the the the celebrations as well you know and so you celebrate the feast of this saint which is your the feast of your local saint and people dress up in certain colors they you know they dress up the statue there's this really kind of dirty uh you know something which is very formal in its purpose but ends up being very messy and organic and it's in its implementation uh which is something that i feel gets lost in the furthering centuries and that leads to like netflix ultimately which which is just this when you sit in front of a screen and you just watch something let's say well um i mean that might be a bit of a conflation but um even to be talking about opera and ballet we're pushing things forward centuries from where we've just been um and so and i absolutely agree that what's wonderful about the medieval church is this participatory and celebratory nature of it and i contrast that in fact um in the book with what happened with the rise of protestantism um the abstraction the verbalization of experience and not the embodied rituals which contained experience that has deep meaning so that's in other words a move towards being explicit i would say over implicit meaning so i i don't think that you know once again i'm sorry to disappoint you but i don't think there's anything here that we're going to come to blows over um but i do think that there are some significant differences i i don't know about this uh observer who's not really taken up into it i mean even for the sake of argument let's move forward a few centuries and talk about opera and ballet and my own experience of them is a profoundly moving i mean the the things in life that can really earth-shatteringly move me are in fact occasional experiences in operon ballet so um i i'm not sure quite what you mean you said internal emotion and i didn't know quite what an external emotion was but maybe i misunderstood no i think what i mean is that so i think that opera probably can let's say call you to transformation like there's some aspect of opera which calls you for for to transformation but the liturgical life is very much all about transformation a transformation of the individual transformation of the community through the community through this let's say common action where we are not dancing per se but we are processing together we are venerating the same things we are celebrating you know uh that that is transformational is is all is binding the society together you know as it is as it is expressing also the little idiosyncratic realities of being in a village in spain or being you know because all these liturgical acts would also have been somewhat universal because you could recognize them but they would also have had a very very local flavor with you know whatever idiosyncratic practice that someone in a little village would develop and so that's what i mean by this kind of this call to participation which is which is not something that you even only experience alone but we experience uh together in the way that we're together that is as a village as a community right not as people sitting in a room watching the same thing but as the manner in which you know i have to forgive my brother i have to deal you know i'm here with my mother that i fight with all the time but now we're celebrating this saint there's something about that that's pulling me towards something more than just my my experience let's say there were two things that you you described there that seem to be very important though nowadays we might think of them as contraries but they are not they need to co-exist one is the sense of being together over time and space and the other was of the idiosyncrasy or the idiom of the local place which embedded you in that particular context so in spain or in france there was something different but it was still the same liturgy and the same tradition and so forth and and the other thing was this idea of transformation because of course the other way one can see religious ritual is in continuity and confirmation of what there is that it eternally continues so but that doesn't of course um mean that it it it can't involve and and that it should not involve transformation personal transformation and i i keep thinking in terms of the coming together of opposites because it's a big theme in my my latest book the matter with things but you know heraclitus says this was a mysterious thing by changing it remains the same which i really understand so yes i i i think all those things are wonderful and important yeah and i think what that's definitely what i got from your book is this powerful this powerful understanding of of how the one and the many you know need each other in order to exist it is there is you can't separate them they they they have to they define them they find each other and we see that in our smallest experience of anything we view as having unity we can all immediately see its parts in its unity and it there's this breathing back and forth between the the two aspects and and we tend to over emphasize there we tend to radically think to think that oh we need decentralization we need we need to we need we need to be personal and and original and everything or we need to all be the same and everybody has a number just so there's this radicalization in the modern world which takes away from this organic relationship between one and many let's say yes i mean first of all um what look to us like parts in one context are holes in another and what looks like for now a whole is also a part of something else so this movement backwards and forwards between what we see as a whole and the parts is terrifically important including if we pride ourselves on being able to see the whole this is not achieved by excluding recognition of an awareness of the parts it must actually involve that at the same time yeah definitely definitely um and so i think my biggest question then after these few little escapades on the middle ages is what do you see what do you see as the the way forward because on the one hand we have an analysis of the problem and maybe an abstract uh an abstract prognosis of what it is that should happen let's say that we should rediscover this but in practice how do you how do you see the way forward for us there's a very good question and in a way you suppose there which some of your listeners or viewers may not know that um the martian is emissary ends with my attempt to portray what the world would look like if we only listen to the sort of things our left hemisphere can tell us and very few people have failed to spot that it's a picture of where we are now um and why that's important is that as i show in the new book that matter with things the the right hemisphere sees a much more vertical picture of the world takes in a vastly richer picture than the map that the sort of skeletal theory of things which is available to the left hemisphere um i've just been reading mattis desmet's book the psychology of totalitarianism which i think is very good um and one of the things he says which is exactly what i always feel is important is there are not a few fixes there are not a couple of things that we ought to practice and make sure we do these often when i've given a talk people want to know so what are the sort of four things i need to do and there really aren't four things as it were we need a complete shift in consciousness that is the point and in my terms this means being aware of all that the right hemisphere can see that the left hemisphere rules out but to be more specific in the last part the third part of the matter with things i i paint a picture of a cosmos as it would come to us if we could attend both with the right and the left hemispheres one in which the coincidence of opposites is central in which this tension between the one and the many is not to be resolved but actually it's valuable only because we can hold that tension so often it's not collapsing into one or other pole which is the modern tendency when we see two things that we think are opposed but actually holding them both in tension together and to understand that i i'd refer sometimes to heraclitus's idea of the taught string of a liar that gives the note or the torch string of a bow that allows the arrow to fly if you let that tension between two things pulling apart go the string would just collapse and there would be no arrow and there would be no music so we need those things together and then i i changed the way in which we think i hope about the so-called building blocks i mean about things like time and space and matter and consciousness but also putting at the front of things what a lot of people would think rather surprising as choices for constituents of the cosmos values purpose and the sense of the sacred and i think the loss of these because we've swallowed this very simplistic mechanistic ideology which which i'm afraid only leads as desmet suggests in his book to um a state of anxiety fear loss of the sense of meaning and cohesion which causes people to flock towards totalitarian solutions control and so forth so what we need is to regain some sense of the values that i believe are there in the cosmos the sense of it having a drive which i think undeniably does unless you're brainwashed into believing you can't see such a thing and this all-important sense of the sacred so if you wanted a single phrase it would be to [Music] re-sacralize our values to certainly think of our values as core parts of any reality that we have and examine what it is we're valuing and i draw here as i do in the master and his emissary on an image which i find particularly helpful which is the pyramid of values suggested the hierarchy of values suggested by the german phenomenological philosopher max schaeler who i think is is very profound and and he describes these different tiers of value with um at the very bottom layers of utility and pleasure and at the top the sense of the sacred and it seems to me that we live in a world in which you've totally inverted these things and all that matters is utility and pleasure and that all these other things which don't just include the sense of the sacred but um just under the sense of sacred is the idea of beauty truth and goodness my goodness i'm going to say what has happened to truth in these times what has happened to goodness what has happened to beauty and below that but still above utility and pleasure values such as courage magnanimity generosity fidelity uh these things that it seems to me are also part of the the bonfire of things that we think we can do without but actually are part of why life is worth living at all yeah and so i don't know in your thinking about this if you thought a bit about dante um one of the because one of the the the elements that i tried to bring about is first of all the the element of of imitation and then the the element of celebration and so one of the one of the things about humans is that we don't we don't celebrate uh values we celebrate people we celebrate places we celebrate events we celebrate memories we celebrate things that participate in our life and so the reason why i bring up dante is that what dante seems to do is that he seems to join this hierarchy of virtues with a ontological hierarchy of saints and angels and so it's not just about celebrating the virtue but it is about finding imitation you know and so being pulled up by beatrice being pulled up by by uh by bernardo clairvaux and it's by and it's through these celebratory imitations that we actually are pulled into participation and there's something you know there's something about the the platonic way of formulating it which i think is makes it difficult for humans to to do that and and that's why i mean i guess that's as you know i'm expl i'm very much a christian and i and i think that in the in the christian participation they were able to take what was best of the platonic good and these this hierarchy of virtues but then joined them to actual imitation and celebration and participation and so the the the so that i guess i i my big question is do you think that the the way back to this is religious or do you propose rather a irreligious or a religious way to for us to re-embrace these these ways of being well um i think that fundamentally we do need a religious cult of mind i i i have to be careful because which is why i wrote a very long book showing people what i'm not saying because there is an immediate reflex in many people's minds now to shut down as soon as one mentions religion um and in this country which is a godless country compared with america no doubt canada if you ask people do they belong to a religion about 13 of them say that they do um so 87 are not but if you ask people do you think there's more to this life and to this world than is accounted for in the reductionist materialist picture 95 of them say yes so people are missing something extremely powerful and what is wonderful in what you said and i completely endorse and have written about in a number of places is this idea of being attracted forwards to something that we wish to imitate and it's in complete contrast to the mechanistic universe in which we are to play things of causality in which things from behind as it were push us forward and i contrast this with the idea of an ideal of something that appeals to us that draws us forwards we may feel a huge gap between us and whatever that ideal might be i mean in the middle ages the immutation christi the imitation of christ and the sense of an ideal of course one's not asked to be those ideals because that's not possible but to feel the pull and never to disparage that pool and to live in the full meaning of that gravitational force on one's life so i think that's a a brilliant idea and in just to finish because you mentioned so many things uh plato i mean in one sense of course what is common there between that picture and the one of medieval christianity with dante and plato would be the idea of these attractive ideals because i think plato thought that we were called forward to these things we we sensed them and we wanted to be with them and like them but the bit that is not is the disparagement of all that is material of the whole business of the incarnate world and my god the whole point of christianity is that god became incarnate i mean it's absolutely the central part of that religion and along with it the much misunderstood idea of redeeming carnality uh taking it back into into heaven in the idea of resurrection yeah no definitely i think that that's that's something when people point to the very to the platonic uh vision of christianity which which we have to be honest has does poke its head up once in a while where we do have a disparaging of the body and we do have a disparaging of of of this incarnate principle but i think that once in a while no i it a central part of christianity to our um consternation but there we are yeah but i think i think that there's there's also a difference between let's say a tendency towards asceticism which we definitely do see in in christianity but then that let's say the bodily celebration will happen will happen in the forums like it'll happen in the the colorful processions in the you know if you think about we often have a very strange image of what the middle ages were like the middle ages everybody belonged to all these associations and in groups and they all had all these very strange practices and there was something about you know you know holding the relic of a dead person you know having this there's so this direct connection uh to to to uh to embodiment and mortality which was which was uh you know the the whole idea of the um of the uh the miracle um at the cathedral the miracle of uh of uh why is it that i forget the name of the name i'm sorry i forget the name of the of the saint the saint that was killed in the cathedral by by the king uh though the miracle right he was it was his body that was plunged into a into a tub and they had they'd killed him and then they would let leak the water out of that tub and people would drink it to their and it's like that is that is not the incarnation that is actually quite scandalous almost tantric you know vision of like of of uh of the body and our participation in it so i think i think that it's true i do see that there is in there has been a tendency towards a kind of dualism in uh in the christian tradition but there is also a lot of space to bring out the incarnational aspect and i mean more so i think also in the in the eastern tradition there really is this this celebration of the transfiguration and the resurrection very much so so exactly i was just going to say this all this is much more present at least now in the eastern tradition of the greek and the orthodox russian and romanian orthodox churches so um yes and of course what one needs to be able to preserve if possible is the sense that you know flesh is not something simply to see as abject and to be as it were if possible got rid of but also not to see it as central or absolutely essential to whatever it is one means by the living spirit or soul of the person so again it's one of these holding togethers of things that don't seem immediately um to cohere i um i don't know whether i'm i can call myself a christian or not i i'm rather lives to make such a grand claim um and i know that it's perfectly all right to acknowledge one's complete failure to be a good christian and still call oneself a christian but i i i certainly draw enormously spiritually from the christian tradition how could one absolutely not it's so fantastically rich and it was that really that drew me to it in my teens having been brought up in a family where religion played no part at all um so much so that by the end of my teens i planned to become a monk which really i didn't i didn't i didn't know that no no i my idea was to go to oxford study philosophy and theology and then probably go into a monastic order and fortunately for any monastic order and for myself um this plan changed and i don't think i'd have fitted in very well but really the only reason i'm sort of mentioning that is to say that i suppose my position which i think is is a very important part of the way i look at things is a panenthist position not pantheism which simply as you know means that everything is god and god is everything that's the sum of everything but that god is not god is in everything and everything is in god which leaves room for god to be more than we can know or say by just summing everything that we believe to be real but yeah i think that that position is definitely in tune with with the the more mystical aspect of the eastern tradition you know you really do have an apathetic vision of of god which is central to to to all the mythical practices in the eastern church and then but then there is also like you said there is this filling up which you i think that that's what you see in in dionysus the arapah guide so clearly is that he he does these two extreme movements where he he says no you cannot say anything which touches god god is beyond all definitional name well you know being non-being he's he's beyond all things but at the same time he is to be found everywhere and and hidden behind all phenomena you know you know things that yes yes yeah yeah um i must say i'm i probably more than you um adherent to the idea of hypothesis of the apathetic tradition which presented me with a problem because at the end of the the recent book um which occupied me over the last decade or so the matter with things at the end i have this chapter on the sense of the sacred which is i think over 100 pages long so it's really a short book and i started it knowing that anything that one says about god is going to be wrong and that therefore whatever i said was going to be in some ways either an idol that got between one and god or at least a distraction and a falsehood but the alternative was to say nothing at all about it and that seemed to me actually a greater betrayal of it because it's better to as it were fail the best you can and acknowledge the extent of your failure than to say nothing although i was advised by very kind friends and colleagues don't include this chapter you know the book contains a lot of interesting philosophy but people will stop taking you seriously if you write a chapter on the sacred um but anyway at the end of the day i did so there we are yeah but i think we're in an interesting position right now in terms of the current let's say intellectual space where the the notion of apophaticism when you look at at uh you know the developments in cognitive science and the way in which people are seeing the limits of definitions and are talking about complexity and emergence the notion of apophatic thinking is just it has to to rush back in because we realize that there's almost like a fractal apatheticism where although we tend to talk about apophaticism in terms of god there's also a phenomenological apopheticism which is that all things present themselves as always more than what than what they are and so there's they all call you there's this calling behind all phenomena which i think heidegger was was wanting us to to get a sense of with his idea of design and so so it seems like it's a good time to talk about that no i agree completely and of course interestingly um the apathetic path is the path that is taken by science itself science can never say this is the case it can only say that as we see things now we can say that the following things are not the case so in other words it's all it's always um alerting us to things that we should not prefer but is unable to say this is the truth yeah and that's interesting because although that is ingrained in the scientific method itself it oh it's always betrayed in its popular the way it's presented in the in popular world it's always about you know science says this and you know so now we follow this line yes um i i wonder if you agree with me but sorry i just say um i don't know if you agree with me but i i think that a lot of this is due to the prevalence of um talking heads from the biological world i'm very impressed by the modesty of physicists and their utter readiness to acknowledge the extent of their understanding but um there are a number of people who've uh become used to the idea that they're obviously very good at molecular biology and that this gives them the authority to pronounce on whether there's a god or not yeah who won't name any names yeah so i i think you're probably right absolutely not yeah i think you're you're you're probably right uh there is something i mean i'm from the the during the entire 20th century there's a sense in which some of the physicists had very deep mystical at least insight or at least a kind of mystical reserve uh facing the facing the way phenomena was presenting itself to them yes in discussing matter and consciousness i i quote many of the great physicists of the last century and as you probably know there's hardly a single one in fact i can't think of one who does who doesn't really embrace this idea that consciousness is a ontological primary um which doesn't necessarily mean that it is prior to matter but that it is an ontological primary in the sense that you can't get behind it and say that it's derived from something else i think to have a dispute about matter and consciousness may be a mistake if one's arguing that consciousness is um prior to match i think that case can be made and i'm sympathetic to it but i think at the moment what i hold is that they are in fact different phases of the same phenomenon much as ice and steam and the flowing liquid are all manifestations of water if you say which one is the real water which came first well there isn't an answer to that question they're all completely different manifestations of the same thing with utterly different qualities but they are effectively the same yeah and i mean a simple formulation of that would be either you see in scripture that it says in the beginning god created heaven and earth and those two primary categories whether you see it as the dao or as the yin yang for example has these two primary categories they don't you know they are in a way a manifestation of something apophatic behind it but as they appear they appear as two two opposites in attention that that could play with each other and that communic how can i say they one expresses the other and the other you know finds body in in the other and there's this this interplay so so i think that that's something yeah it's something that is there in in in basic just theological thinking i think it is and it's embraced by the idea of pananthism um and in in in my thinking uh the idea that the cosmos and the divine principle um are constantly in an act of co-creation that's very important this is an idea that was articulated by uh alfred north whitehead who i hold in considerable esteem um yeah well i i'd probably struggle a little more with whitehead in the sense that i think that there's yeah there's a manner in which let's say the revelation of the divine principle at least for a christian from a christian perspective the revelation of the divine principle will happen in this almost like intercourse right you have this almost sexual imagery in scripture between the bride and the bright room between between the two aspects uh uh but that there is let's say the infinite is beyond behind that or you know the there is a there is an apophatic emptiness or source out of which this this this play kind of comes into being uh which is which at least in scripture is represented as the let's say the first moment of creation and so so you have heaven and earth but you have something which is beyond behind you know the the that is the source of both of that opposite just so we don't fall into a kind of duality a dualism no well i i no i think we're not not to exactly um i i i suppose my belief about the divine are precessual um so i believe that the divine creation is a process in fact i believe that all things are processes what we call things are in fact ways of nominalizing processes and making us think that they're somehow distinct and separate from other things others processes but i think what you're possibly trying to do um which i would sympathize with is maintain the possibility because after all we agreed that ordinary language won't encompass the divine that we can have an idea of god as eternal and as something that is constantly coming into being well i guess i think so but at least that's the way that i would see it and i would see let's say the divine story or this a good image that you see in in scripture you have this grand story right where you you have this movement from the garden to the city and this filling up of the world with presence and so it starts with a the seed with a tree in the natural world and it ends with this glorious uh shining uh filling up of even human activity with this with this you know with with a divine presence you could say but it is like an idealized vision of this process of filling up of the world with with uh with the divine principle um [Music] yeah i don't know about perhaps i question but i don't want to get into legalistic matter of procedure but i don't know about filling up um suggesting that at some point it wasn't filled i mean my idea of process is not that something becomes um to a greater degree divine but that the divine becomes to a greater degree what it is see what i mean so it's not a matter of filling up something that was formally an imperfection by adding in some more divinity but but instead that the divine is itself something that is eternally um something that can be un unfolded without in any way damaging its integrity in fact yeah no i i definitely agree and you could see it almost like as a you could see the story uh as an intersection within within god like it it's it's like you see it we see it as a slice of something which is eternally happening and eternally true but because of our because of our position you know we just see this as this line a point there and a point there and a in the through line but ultimately it is something which is eternally happening or not either word happening even doesn't doesn't account for what it is we're um and so i guess i i guess let's say if you had advice to give to to the people that are listening in terms of what you feel that they should be attending to or doing or or because it's the project of having a radical change of consciousness is a pretty big project and and i think that it can seem so big that for people reading or for people listening they'll feel like well what am i gonna what am i gonna do then because the world it seems like especially in the last few years things have gotten much worse uh with cobit and the reaction to kobit and you know this there's the totalitarian spirit has felt itself very uh let's say pressing down on pressing down into us and uh and also a way we've also felt a a willingness to it to to to embrace it out of a fear of anxiety of danger and anxiety of of uncertainty and so what do you suggest for people that they could do in their in their lives yes well what i'm going to say is is probably not terribly satisfactory but i i do rather hold with desmet that i mean i'm very glad to hear him say specifically what i also believe that it's no good thinking of one or two things we can do we need to move to a different in a vision of who we are and what the cosmos is which will enable us to rediscover the integrity of experience to rediscover the sense of value purpose direction which is not something i believe that we paint on to the universe something inside our head we will paper it in a pleasant way in order to make ourselves feel better about being in this terrific prison of the skull i don't believe that at all i believe that we are in fact when we're experiencing we are in touch with something that is entirely real we only see part of it of course a very small part but the part that we do see is nonetheless real even if it's not the all and and that these things need can be rediscovered but not piecemeal um i mean the nearest i can get pieces meal is we'll try um mindfulness meditation for half an hour every day but that's not a very satisfactory answer either so i'm going to give them the most unsatisfactory answer but quite honestly the best answer i'm sorry to say this but it might be worth reading the matter with things if you can bear to because the whole point of that undertaking was precisely to take somebody who couldn't see anything here beyond the reductionist materialist paradigm and take them by logical steps that they can acknowledge to a place where instead of thinking only somebody with an educ lack of education or very simple minded would believe in the the sacred and the divine nowadays i want them to arrive there and think that only somebody who's rather simple minded or not very well educated would jump to the conclusion that there's nothing in this sacred that one really needs to try and approach it and of course one will never know it unless one puts oneself in the way of doing so which means opening oneself to it so it's no good waiting for it to come and knock on your door you have to not sort of you have to do what i call active receptivity so you have to attend in a manner that will allow something to come into being in the space that you have opened by your receptive attention i believe this is how artists are able to conceive their works of art and i believe it's how we get to understand the existence of the sacred um i think it's what is meant by prayer probably the this attention this open attention in which one's not talking to or about god but actually listening um i think this is a very important thing attention is at the core of it and i know you yourself think attention is very important i call attention a moral act because the kind of attention we pay changes the world it changes what is there to find and it also changes us in the process of attending and i think here of uh two french philosophers of the last century one very well known simon vay who said that attention is the you know to pay attention is the greatest act of generosity and that it it mediates our ability to understand the the what comes to us through prayer and louis lavelle saying that love is a pure attention to the existence of the other i think this is brilliant and important and so paying that attention is necessary how to do that what i'm hoping is that after reading what i have to say people will feel that experience and i'm emboldened to say this by the fact simply um that people keep writing to me and saying since reading your work i i can't not see the world in a certain way it's changed my sense of of my life it's changed my my relationships it's changed my work and now i see everything through this different lens so if somebody says well can you hand me the lens i say yes it's out there yeah and i think that i think that what you're saying is the idea of attention is is a very simple and perfect way to help people understand because like you said you you i can you can explain it to for a certain amount amount of time but then you know the everybody knows what it means to pay attention to at least to a certain extent but if you start to practice it you know and you can see the difference especially if you have a family if you have kids you know you can you pay attention to your kids like real attention yes that's it's transformational and then they don't people say you need to spend time with the kids like no you can pay attention to your child for 15 minutes and they will go on their way and play alone they'll be happy because they will have gotten that that that connection that they're looking for it's a kind of magic um it bestows something on whatever one is attending to it brings it to life and the trouble is that one's attention is valuable to capitalism everybody wants a grab of your attention to buy their thing but this is to to reduce one of the greatest things that exists um to some [Music] to desecrate it to trail it through the mud and say no it's just about listening to what i've got to say what you've got to say this jingle this this message from your machine the way to achieve it is to switch all that off and empty your life out i mean i i i i'm not saying certainly that i've got anything you need to model i i i'm not very good at any of this but i do actually live in a place where i can't get a mobile signal at all i you can't get a television signal or you could i suppose with a satellite but i don't um and so i have an enormous amount of peace outside there is a very beautiful world in which things are speaking to me if i allow them to speak and don't over over um explain or or talk to them but just open to their their being so there is some kind of commerce that is vivifying that comes about through one's attention to the world and as you say it is it is a generative act well i think that that's a beautiful place to to finish our conversation i think people can can leave with a with uh with a nice little a nice little nugget of wisdom that they can apply in their lives uh so so dr mcgill chris thank you so much for your time and for for meeting with me was it was a wonderful conversation well well thank you so much london i very much enjoyed it
