there's a saying that i usually dislike tell me if you've heard it before truth is stranger than fiction my problem with it is that most of the time the people saying it haven't read much fiction because fiction can be pretty strange but every now and then something happens which gives this tired old saying new life and it makes me rethink it this is one of those stories a story of a nom police forces around the world have made hundreds of arrests as part of a major sting targeting organized crime networks criminal bosses were tricked into using an fbi run encrypted messaging app officers were able to read millions of messages in real time describing murder plots mass drug importation plans and lots of other schemes 18 months at least of capturing this criminal activity so this is really a proud day for the good guys ladies and gentlemen welcome to the 10 million dollar studio i'm your host coffee zilla and i would submit to you that if you look today you'll find hundreds of articles telling you about a global sting operation that led to 800 arrests 700 premises searched and maybe you'll even hear of sopia kong the ninja warrior competitor that she was even one of the arrested with 154 grams of walter white seized maybe you've heard that something called encrypted messaging was involved but i'm gonna tell you that's just the surface of this thing the idea of infiltrating the underworld with a fake privacy phone is said to have started over a couple of beers between the australian police and the fbi in 2018. kind of makes sense right that's where all good ideas start see the big news going around was the criminal underworld had a privacy hole in the market and the police well they wanted to capitalize on it this is because one of the criminal network's main communication methods had just totally collapsed obviously the underworld kind of relies on constant communication some of it very long distance to conspire to launder money traffic drugs do business etc so they've turned to sophisticated encryption to keep their plans secret from the cops now you may have heard of a few apps like these apps like signal which are devoted to encrypted messaging but for some criminals that isn't enough nearly all phones have gps cameras microphones in them which are all liabilities so as a result a small industry has opened up to help those people who want true privacy from law enforcement enter the privacy file let's pull up the board here these are phones purely designed for privacy they have their gps disabled most of them have a lot of apps disabled and they route messages through proxies before delivering them so your location is sort of always unknown and some of these phones don't even allow you to message anyone who doesn't share a privacy phone like yours further securing your communication now one of the companies that filled this need was known as phantom secure phantom secure was a canadian-based company that was operated by ceo vincent ramos the company had it all secure messaging it even created a remote kill switch that could wipe the device's data remotely which was hugely popular you know in case your device got compromised by the cops and apparently it worked because documents show that multiple times law enforcement got a hold of these phones they'd find them wiped now as a quick caveat if it seems like i've been insinuating here that everyone who's interested in privacy phones are criminals that's obviously not intended and not true there are a million reasons to want privacy and i support encryption but in the case of phantom secure it's more specifically was kind of a drug thing okay vincent ramos literally told undercover agents he made the phone for drug trafficking this is actually a screenshot of an undercover meeting with vincent seated in a couch trying to reassure drug dealers who were skeptical about the phone he apparently told them but yeah that's exactly what i'm saying right we made it phantom secure we made it specifically for this too meaning drug trafficking this admission gave him a one-way ticket to being arrested and eventually flipping as a state witness in exchange for the hope of a more lenient sentence which meant that everyone who had previously used phantom secure were suddenly left without a privacy phone they couldn't use the phone network anymore and they were looking for a new device to rely on so now we can go back to this conversation between the fbi and australia over beers they knew that there was this gap in the market the loss of phantom secure had been huge for criminals and a plan emerged to capitalize on this they decided that they would create their own privacy phone and they would sell it to criminals and track the messages now this game isn't anything new it's actually something called a honeypot and it's common within sting operations law enforcement will use some kind of a device to bring in criminals and then catch them right this is famously bait car was a car that could be remotely turned off by the police it was attracted you know criminals who stole cars and then they would catch them and lock them up but in this case the honeypot is a secure phone called the anom phone the anom phone company built itself like a privacy phone like phantom secure it looked like a phone acted like a phone but it couldn't do most things it wasn't like other phones obviously instead to use it you had to go to the calculator app installed on the phone and type in a special code which lets you in the app now at this point and maybe i'm crazy i think the criminal should have gotten suspicious but maybe that's just hindsight talking right this was a well-designed app it looks good as you can see it was even designed by a drug dealer who had flipped to work for the fbi and the way this app worked was that every message would be secretly sent to the police alongside the receiver so that the cops could basically watch criminals talk to each other without them knowing and slowly they distributed these phones through a network of criminals some of which who used to operate and sell the phantom securum network and each time a new criminal got it that would then serve as later connections to sell their people on it over the course of three years 12 000 devices had eventually been sold to 300 criminal syndicates which is insane and basically the cops had created their own little thriving phone business and that's actually one of the hilarious parts of this whole story is that the cops are selling phones like a phone company to criminals and selling even subscription services like you literally had to pay a monthly fee for this and the phone itself wasn't cheap either it was 2500 bucks a piece all of this is going back to the police which is kind of hilarious when you think about it like you're paying the people who are about to arrest you and it allowed the cops unprecedented access into the underworld and a nom of course was a huge hit not only with the cops but also with users soon the messages began to roll in messages like this think he got it you're dreaming you reckon what did he offer it to you for the guy responds with a bunch of what appears to be cocaine with batman on it now there are tons of other messages like this but most of them have the grammar of a five-year-old and also they're pretty repetitive they're all sort of talking about drugs or violence of some kind i'll sort of save you uh some of the the low res text messages real quick and get to the point the cops start busting these guys drug shipments left and right for example one of the cocaine shipments they busted was found among pineapples who had been cored out to put the cocaine in in another bust they found 3 000 pounds of cocaine hidden in a shipment of tuna cans of all things i can only imagine how confusing it must have been for the criminals at this point to like be planning these things in secret with these secure phones and suddenly the cops are just showing up knowing everywhere you are and you're calling your buddy like did you hide it in the pineapples though 800 arrests two tons of math eight tons of cocaine 22 tons of marijuana 250 firearms 48 million dollars and six tons of chemicals that are used to make other drugs and stuff law enforcement also says they thwarted something like a hundred murder plots which is completely insane and shows just how productive this sting operation was the only thing that sucks is that the fact that you and i know about this means that the criminals know about it too it's an open secret and criminals will be much more careful using privacy phones now but there's one last funny wrinkle i need to tell you about if it seems sort of unbelievable that none of the criminals suspected anything actually someone did an anonymous blogger released a post called a nom encrypted scam exposed the blogger's name was can you guess 67 and on march 29th he wrote this article detailing how a nom is actually not a secure phone at all and he compares it to cipher which is another privacy phone company and showed how a nom is unsecured it links to various google servers and it's easy to pull ip information which obviously you don't want out there and this all happened at a completely critical moment for this sting because the big sting hadn't happened yet it was a lot of you know data collection watching letting the phones sort of proliferate around the underworld according to the us attorney only in the last 48 hours of the investigation did the plan get most of its results 500 of the 800 arrests came in the last 48 hours of the giant sting and this one post called it out three months beforehand but here's the insane thing and again this is where this story is hard to believe this guy can you guess 67 he didn't get it all right he of course pointed out that the phones were on secure and went through like amazon servers google servers but he had no idea why and in possibly the most hilarious twist of irony of all time he finishes the blog post by saying that he reported a nom to law enforcement needless to say shortly after he reported this the post was deleted and the plan stayed safe three months later of course the massive sting went down and i believe it's going to go down as one of the most legendary moments of police intelligence work in decades but it was almost unraveled by a guy who thought he was simply exposing a scam the story of a nom is a fascinating look into the lives not only of the criminal underworld but also our intelligence agencies who seemingly will go to any length to get by encryption services and get into this underworld where they can find and catch criminals this operation not only hurt organized crime what i love about it is that i believe it serves as a reminder that sometimes the cops aren't as blind as people want to believe sometimes they're a step ahead listening in on your conversations
