ladies and gentlemen it is with great pleasure that I welcome you back to the freestyle Chess Championship here in February of 20124 today is the second day of the semi-finals we have Magnus Carlson taking on NOC abdur the USC Phenom we also have Fabiano Carana fighting to stay alive against Leana ronian and the winners of those two matchups will move on to the finals which begin tomorrow this was an unbelievable day of games oh my goodness I am so excited to share it with you uh before I do it's also Valentine's Day so happy Valentine's Day to you and your loved ones uh as well as you know your future loved ones I'm wishing all of you find love uh someday to celebrate Valentine's Day all my courses are 25% off and my Scandinavian course dropped today I'll put a link to it in the description I've been loving the Scandinavian defense recently I've been winning like 80% of my games with it and I've made a new course so check it out if you're interested there's a free sample so so you could get it for free just go try it for free no strings attached let it's 100% free I'm not lying to you so definitely try the Scandinavian and uh get a course for 25% off for Valentine's Day here we go Alli res so we're going to move along through the 5ifth through 8th Place then I'm going to show you Magnus then I'm going to take you uh on a on a crazy Journey uh Ali Resa fua leads one to nothing versus dingly Ren dingly Ren has played two 10 games in this event he has two draws and eight losses I mean you would have a score very you'd have 10 losses but you know it it's very close and that's really shocking so dingly Ren is playing with the black pieces he has to beat Ali Reza to stay alive he kind of plays like a Scandinavian which is very interesting take take except um it's not really a Scandinavian but the first you know these moves are like a Scandinavian now normally white plays Knight C3 but white doesn't have a knight there if you're confused what's going on they're playing chess 960 or Fisher random or freestyle chess and they are drawing the position before every single game Queen A5 and Ali Resa says listen ding you can't beat me if we trade Queen so quickly my position is a lot less risky D5 ding plays E5 and now a very surprising move here from mly Reza who doesn't preserve his Pawn but rather takes on passon now ding very quickly plays Rook C6 but again remember Ali Resa just has to not lose he doesn't have to win he just has to not lose so he plays long Castle ding also long castles that's not through a check by the way the Rook just plops there and now Ali Resa just plays like this and yeah uh this is the position after 13 moves no queens no Rooks no service Bishop H2 Bishop D6 B3 King D2 and uh yeah the recap of this game is going to be very quick as the players literally trade all their pieces black has a very tiny Advantage because of an outside pass Pawn but uh you know they play a little a little while and ding puts a little bit of pressure and is definitely better in the night end game like ding with his outside pass Pawn is definitely going to put some pressure but yeah he is still winless and by the way if you're confused what happened there that was uh I don't actually I don't I don't I that was I don't know I don't know why they decided to end the game like this and not here but yeah uh Ali resen knocks out ding so ding can only get seventh or eighth place or I don't know if he's even going to play a match for seventh and eighth place but um yeah he has three draws and eight defeats and it it is a shocking turn of events now the other fifth through eighth place match is this one between ker and gukesh yesterday Vincent kimer absolutely obliterated gukesh he played a beautiful game I mean it's really difficult like if you didn't make it to the finals to motivate yourself to try to play in these matchups but you know it is what it is and that's what they're doing and Vincent plays kind of a Stonewall so again previous game was like a Scandinavian so these guys are just inventing opening Theory as we go F4 right we bring out a bunch of the pawns and Vincent just hates his light squares I mean Vincent puts every Pawn on a dark Square I don't know what he's going to do with the bishop clearly neither does he but I'm not the one playing the game I'm the one commentating it like an hour uh well no it's been about four hours I was driving uh my wife to the airport today and something really interesting happened when I was driving her to the airport the GPS died like I've I you know I that's happened before but usually comes back and this time it just completely died and I was like oh I know the way home and I I I did uh but not for the first 20 minutes I just took a wrong turn that was crazy did anybody else Google Maps die today or is that just me Knight takes Bishop takes Knight to H6 you'll notice that you know kimer says hey take my Pawn gkes is like no you take my Pawn Ker's like okay but uh yeah Vincent moved his King The King did not start over there and now GES is like boink yeah and Vincent is about to really pay the price for having an active King in fiser random cuz that's not really what you want so he runs it over here gkes puts his Knight on G4 and hello hello here come the Bishops he's either going to open things up or uh or Target this Pawn with the bishop on H6 it's a really dangerous position and then he grabs the bishop to take like this and who's going to guard the pawn on E3 well if it's the queen take take look at this gangster move undevelop the queen to the eigh Rank and nobody can guard the pawn nobody if you play Knight to F4 which blocks I take the Knight and then I take the bishop and that's really bad so he undeveloped he hasn't touched these pieces so gkes is winning this game despite not using either of his Rooks which is badass by the way Rook C3 Bishop E3 he picks up both of these what a move you if you take I have this Vincent tries to create some counterplay here but oh just the speed at which gesh neutralizes everything grabs himself a rook his King is completely safe Queen comes back he trades the queens and this is easy peasy look at that pinning the Knight to the rook and gukesh wins so gukesh wins on demand and In freestyle chess in this event what happens is they break ties that are oneto one with rapid chess so now they sit down gues just won with black which you know winning with black is impressive anyway because you don't really get to go first but there's an argument to be made that black is actually better in Fisher random which is kind of wild so in this version that they play they now speed things up to break the tie the king is like you could castle by the way that's that's the legal first move uh White actually chose to Castle on the second move which is funny uh the Bishops will probably come out you know in their traditional way I imagine something like this uh gkes does it this way so he tries to just open the diagonals like this De Queen E4 and queen E2 and he's going to put his Bishops on C2 he's going to have a very nice life here come the knights right we we love Knights and and Vincent says okay let's make something happen in the center of the board take take Bishop G5 though targeting the Knight that's going to open up the king cuz Vincent castled no thank you Bishop comes off the home rank now we just have a normal looking position except it looks like Black's Queen fell asleep in a field somewhere I mean the position just kind of looks like you played regular chess both guys castled and got their pieces out but for somehow the queen fell asleep and woke up you know locked behind two Bishops I don't know how that happened and now gesh his mission is to make sure the queen doesn't get into the game in time the queen it will get into the game but in getting into the game kuk will now get a little bit of an advantage he's got five minutes he's got a he's got a Blitz game amount of time oh my what a sophisticated idea One Step all the way back and slides out and that Bishop is an absolute monster on B2 Bishop A5 B4 both guys are about you know are are trending their time is getting a little bit lower A3 around that 3 minute Mark but but Vincent at a minute now trying to create some counterplay on the queen side Lukes takes I'm not sure that was the best trade but opposite colored Bishops do benefit the attacking side okay Queen C3 we threatened mate he defended it damn we oh my what just happened to Kesha's time hold up I was just talking gues had three minutes in the span of three moves he got 28 seconds now this is just a lottery I mean this is basically like a roulette I mean like this is like the equivalent of going to casino and putting it on red Bishop C2 Rook D7 both guys at around 20 seconds what a what a move Queen E6 check with the idea in this position to sack the rook and get in and M the king queen E6 and if you trade Queens with me uhoh who's guarding G7 I got news for you it's nobody and in this position Vincent kimer resigns and gukesh completes the comeback he lost yesterday but he wins two games on demand he wins the rampid time break and he qualifies to a fifth and sixth place match and Vincent probably has to play ding I think now we've arrived at our main event of the evening you were just about to click away cuz you didn't get your daily dose of Magnus but if there's one place on the internet you're going to get your daily dose of Magnus it's right here Magnus Carlson yesterday taking down nobec abdulov in a very tense battle very very tense battle today nobec has to win the same position that I just showed you we just saw a Scandinavian we just saw Vincent play a Stonewall okay and in this game nck just grabs as much Central space as he possibly can all right so the first move caused Magnus to think for a little bit the Dutch by the way we do see D4 F5 a lot in chess 960 this type of setup just counteracting the other side taking a little bit of space from the other side C4 and Magnus strikes back right away um now if no had taken by the way I don't think Magnus would have gone here cuz that walks directly into some stuff that could walk into like various gambits and I think Magnus even went to the confession booth and said like he would have just gone E5 he would have just tried to take space and then if white tries to hang on to his pawns you can't because you're you're just getting viciously undermined from from all sides you have A3 there's take take now you can't Castle now your king is stuck in the corner forever I mean this doesn't work but you know it doesn't lose right and no has to win okay so D6 Magnus plays G6 puts his Bishop out and gets this little Tetris piece of of pieces mobilized very tense position NOC thinks for a bit plays G4 just as many pieces forward as possible Magnus Strikes Back in the center all right we're about to have an explosion D5 this this The Rook is about to open up the queen is about to open up keep in mind no has to win the game so he has to find a way to neutralize but not trade too many pieces so he takes on C5 Magnus brings The Rook out so now the queen has to slide out of the home square and that will allow black to Castle Queen side you can't Castle short side anymore because first of all you have a bishop there but also that Rook was going to be used for that so Knight E5 I do like that move I do like that move trying to get a position like this where you're dislodging the knight from the center but he puts the Knight directly into the center and asks you what you're going to do about it it might have been a little bit better here to um to maybe lock down the position with a move like D5 but it's really hard to do that because you just I mean like what about your Bishop right now if we fast forward to like here you know white is better for sure because White's going to you know continue to advance but he doesn't have that time so Knight E4 we have take take and now it's just the position of Bishops so these guys hate their horses Bishop to H2 lining up and attack on magnus's King Magnus blocks his attack on the king with Queen C7 the queen plays defense against the attack Queen A4 looking to sneak in here and disallowing long Castle because then you would be blundering the A7 Pawn so Magnus plays B5 oh my oh my and uh you can't take cuz that's literally Checkmate so Magnus is just the pawn up oh my goodness it has all gone completely wrong from this position Nock tried to pick a fight but you know even though we're playing freestyle chess or chess 960 or whatever you want to call it principles still apply and one of the most important principles in chess is to deal with a flank attack the best and most principled way is in the center of the board and when it's all said and done suddenly Magnus has a massive massive Advantage Queen C3 Bishop E6 Bishop E2 King slides up to B7 remember no last win the game he darts his King across the board Magnus plays Queen B6 they Clash Magna shuts it down on that side of the board Rook B1 Rook C1 I don't think there's a whole lot here now there's no Queen on the board noi still trying he's kicking Here Comes Rook B5 but Magnus is just slowly stripping away his defenses I mean you're not going to beat Magnus with no pieces on the board and you sure as hell are not going to beat him with with less pawns Bishop G3 H6 Magnus lock it up I think that's it I mean if nobec could somehow play a Yu-Gi-Oh card and get a knight on that square he might win I mean a queen there would be even better but uh in this position rather than even trying to play for the win which he probably can do I mean he can play like here and here and here I mean at at black it it looks like a fortress I mean it looks like you know even if both sides uh let's just say trade like this I mean this is a draw uh but only black can win I'm saying like you know you play King D2 I think it's it should be a win for black I don't exactly see how you would do it especially if black plays like here black plays E6 it's just a draw maybe there is a way to win it like to break through the Fortress but yeah the players just agree to a draw and Magnus Carlson is your first finalist now a lot of you are going to leave because I showed you the Magnus game but he's on fire I mean he's Unstoppable he's he's clearly found his form Magnus needs an opponent [Music] yeah you guys might may want to like grab a snack cuz we ain't done so I mean I'm spoiling a little bit here actually quite literally uh a lot let me just make sure every game is uh you know if you've been following the tournament closely you know Levon won yesterday okay you know he won yesterday and if he wins or draws this game it's Magnus Levon in the final now I literally just showed you the final position but as you can probably tell from my tone of voice it's not that's simple Fabiano caruana plays a completely unique way in an opening that we haven't seen yet remember levon's just trying to make sure that he doesn't lose the game Fabiano gets into a position which is like rock solid and Levon is very much in the like no lose approach what the what yeah A4 and in the span of three moves leevon just loses his C5 Pawn I was so exp excited I just spat so you can instant replay it now if you ask me why did Levon go here I think he didn't like Queen A6 very much but a move ago it's just a dead POS it's a deadlock and he just loses the C5 Pawn to get counterplay on the C file but suddenly as it turns out winning this Pawn back is not that good and Rook C1 is a devastating threat I think Levon just thought he has a you know he's going to win the pawn back and he's going to be fine or Levon just wanted more content for the Gotham recap I mean really I don't know one way or another B6 and uh this does not look like a pleasant position I mean it looks like you did not pay your rent for about six months and you got the landlords right Mafia Style on both sides knocking on the door and this one doesn't go much longer Queen C6 Rook D1 Fabiano marches his King up to A3 Levon tries to create counter play on that side of the board that's as much counterplay as he created now his King tries to escape oh my God what a move and when it's all said and done Fabiano Carana brutally brutally knocks everything down Queen B6 is made on the next move we're going to a playoff and we are going to a playoff so first these gentlemen are going to play 15minute chess all right D4 d E5 C3 castles Bishop C2 Knight G6 Knight G3 they get their Knight out by the way it's the it's the it's the gash game right it's the GES game it's kind of like it looks exactly like the like like the the GES game so castles Bishop G4 and Levon takes on G6 he gives up his light squared bishop and the reason he does that is to get dark squared control and put his Bishop here and play E3 and bring his Queen and it looks like a London is I mean looks like white played to London is take take Fabiano goes for the opposite color Bishops because he's a principled man he doesn't want to lose the game he wants to be stable he plays F6 all right F3 Bishop F5 now B5 B3 holding him back C4 opening up the C file trying to create some counter play and on the very next move this was nuts Fabiano took the pawn on C4 and said I'm going to be up a pawn Levon said you're going to be up a pawn and you're going to be up one migraine E4 push you back let's trade the queen so I can Target those doubled C Pawns Fab's like all right do it take the queen if you're so smart I didn't know I was playing Magnus Magnus aronian Bishop 2 E6 a four Levon just casually improving his position Fabiano has a three four sorry three minute time advantage on the clock with four minutes and 23 seconds I just saw the number four I got very excited Rook D7 Rook B2 Knight B7 Queen A3 and now Fabiano is taking over the game but leavon 27 seconds on the clock rips open the position to the board and counter plate is being created but Fabiano is looking to clean this one up and he will Rookie to A5 pushing back the queen Here Comes black Bishop F2 and that's it Levon on the verge of resigning Fabiano now two pawns up rook takes E7 Queen D2 Queen a wait a minute wait wait a minute it's not so clear Queen D4 Rook d8 wait a minute now fa's got 20 seconds uhoh but he's still he's still in [Music] control he hung his Rook Fabiano Carana hung his rook in one move oh my goodness Rook B8 the nerves the pressure the heart rate they they're wearing these heart rate monitors these guys have heart rates of like 160 and Fabby plays Rook B8 clearly setting up ideas like C3 I mean he probably saw this and queen B1 and you know that doesn't look particularly Pleasant plays Rook B8 and straight up loses the game in one move and obviously Levon still has to clean it up but he does he brings the queen back and yes Fabiano can still create counterplay but after you blunder that you are not saving the game and in this position he resigns and out of nowhere leavon aronian wins the first rapid game oh my goodness oh my goodness now Fabiano corana on Full Tilt I mean absolute Full Tilt B4 we got a brand new position by the way so not only is he tilted he can't even get revenge in the position that they just played cuz in freestyle chess you go in front of a goofy big Monitor and then it tells you what you're playing I'm not criticizing the event I'm I'm saying when the players play in these chess 960 Fisher random events they literally get given a brand new position so you have no advantages you can't play against your opponent's repertoire you just got a 15-minute game and you got to figure it out B4 Bishop B2 bro plays Queen E4 this straight up looks like chat GPT is playing chess and if you haven't seen my videos about Chad GPT playing chess it's not chess I don't know what it is but it ain't chess A3 G3 long Castles by Levon Levon is looking for a fight even when he doesn't need a fight Levon is the fighter who is in the fifth round of a fight he's won four rounds he's still trying to go for The Knockout Knight G4 what are bro Levon really thinks Fabiano is going to blunder Bishop F3 and queen H2 that is wild stuff Knight E5 clearly by the way from the time expenditure Queen E4 Queen F5 Queen H5 Queen E5 ain't it and Fabiano now is like bro A4 like let's go A4 I mean I don't even understand Levon put his King here it's honestly as if Levon is playing in a way like if I lose at least we get to play more games literally I think Levon just really likes the format Fabby plays D5 the move D5 just gets into the black position stops this knight from getting out and cuts all the circulation G5 A5 how are you going to defend this position Bishop takes and now B5 that's how you're going to defend look at that he locked it all down no how is Fabby going to attack now well he plays Bishop G7 winning a Tempo and now despite this move having no protection C4 the idea of C4 is very brute it's just to get stuff going on the C file it's very brute and if you don't take me I'm going to take you look at this oh my goodness apocalyptic level attack on the other side of the board Fabiano is going to be very careful he plays H4 to keep the queen out take take Rook F1 now Queen F1 his Bishop is under attack Fabiano's got 40 seconds oh whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa Fabby had Fabby had 9 Minutes versus five and all of a sudden he is under a minute versus three and a half Fabiano's losing the threat again oh my goodness Queen F1 levon's on a massive comeback by the way the bishop was hanging but you couldn't take it if you took it A7 that was brutal Knight A6 but Fabiano is is still in the driver seat with a monstrous attack Queen takes G7 Queen takes B4 Levon darts over here but Fabo Rook B2 and Levon will live to regret the day that on the fifth move he committed his King to a beach house when Global sea levels are rising and he doesn't have flood insurance Fabiano wins the second game and now it is two to2 and to break the tie again we go to even faster chess we make these boys play five minute by the way Magnus Carlson is sitting somewhere at this German resort with his significant other who he he has been widely documented traveling with you know I cover magnus's games I'm not going to cover his personal life all right so even I have limits he's probably sitting somewhere on this big Resort going huh you know who is going to be next Who's Next these guys are just brutally beat beating each other up you know and he just like won the fight you know easily all right this next game has Bishops in the corners so you got to open them up right so these guys they don't even they just right away right away they get the Bishops opened up G3 there we go in fact just say no bishops from the very beginning they just say you know what no Bishops C4 G6 how about the fact that they have to play with a brand new set of pieces with 5 minutes on the clock isn't that nerve ranking I mean there is a lot of secret conversation here silent conversation of like can we get to a position that looks like a regular chess game and yeah I mean now we kind of have one E5 now it's just a Blitz game D4 from Levon Knight E7 from Fabiano and Fabiano might be cooking up some stuff Knight F3 he plays E4 leavon has to go Knight G5 all of a sudden levon's down to 39 seconds himself like we've seen Fabiano low on time now levon's got no time Knight D5 sacrificing a pawn but Knight C3 so Fabiano picks up a rook leevon now has a knight and a pawn but oh my goodness I'll be damned in Blitz chess Knights are so tricky and Levon does an unbeli look at look at what Levon does from this point forward he stabilizes everything H4 King H2 King G2 Fabiano bulldozes down that side of the board but levon's not going away and now both guys are down to almost no time Levon is getting two second bonus every time he makes a move Fabiano plays Queen A3 Levon plays E4 but Rook A8 and this was Fabiano's cleanest game thus far as he plays Queen to A1 and if you take and take the Knight can't stop the Bon Fabiano cleans up clearly a dominant first Blitz game this is fabi's first lead of the match he leads 3 to2 that was out of nowhere that was like easily his cleanest game thus far and now he's going to put it away the last Blitz game of the day 3-2 Fabiano he's got the white pieces another brand new setup now the Bishops are not on the corners of the board how are the players going to develop Scandinavian the first game of the day was also very similar where there was a queen but there was a knight there was no Knight that could go here well these guys just straight up play as Scandinavian but Knight F6 Knight E3 takes and Fabiano gets a big Center Levon opts for a queenless middle game game where he is just down a clean Pawn but he has counterplay so maybe it's not so clean and white has to waste a little bit of time knight2 Bishop C3 and uh yeah I mean Fab's just a pawn up but okay A5 and Leon's looking to capture on C5 Fabiano brings his Rook Levon plays E6 Fabiano plays B3 solid structure and now Knight C5 Bishop C2 three pawns three pawns two pawns for black and four on the other side Knights and Bishops remember Leon's got to win this game not possible what does he do H5 tries to just instigate generally A good rule of thumb to maybe try to get the The Rook into the game if it's possible and safe Fabby says no thank you but that opens up the G4 Square which now Fabiano you know he trades and he's still solid but the big question is when black starts attacking with his pawns is Fabiano going to be ready King C7 King B2 there it is and now the question is will Fabiano be able to thwart levon's counter attack take take and yeah fb's up to the task B4 I mean just right away doesn't even let Levon think Knight goes back to D7 The Rook is centralized I'm looking at this I'm looking at this I'm looking at the dile I'm looking at F7 I'm looking at B5 and Bishop E4 take take and Levon just has to try to safeguard but this is not what he wanted he's down 30 seconds on the clock and it is Fabiano caruana walking into the black position and he is ready to take what's his it's been a damn long match and this is his first lead of the day Bishop D7 clean Bishop to A4 leevan oh that's so desperate but now the pawn gets to C6 the bishop goes back to C8 who's going to guard the infiltration of the a file Rook H5 Rook D2 Knight F3 Fab's got 7 Seconds though Levon that eight seconds Bishop C4 he's got to trade that Knight Fabiano Rook A1 check and Levon cannot trade the Rooks so Fano walks his King to B4 and he's completely winning Leon's got no time plays E5 and now Fabiano plays Rook A8 leavon goes here Rook A7 Fabiano completely winning pushes his Pawn to C7 Rook to h8 and plays Rook to B7 hanging The Rook in one move and he resigns the game and Levon wins by the way Valentine's Day Sale 25% off check out the Scandinavian course even if you don't want to buy it just check out the free sample it's really great course I promise you will enjoy it Knight takes B7 Fabiano's heart rate right here was 170 that's my heart rate when I play Squash can you imagine I'm not saying I'm like healthier I'm saying I panic the like the exact same way that is nuts 170 is wild and he plays Rook B7 he just Rook B I mean already it's actually kind of difficult here after Knight C5 he had to go Rook F7 he had to get to the other side before going C7 and then he had to go after this Pawn if the King goes here he has C7 if the Rook goes back his Rook H7 it's tough though it's tough to spot this he has no time and he wins leevon and now they got to play an Armageddon and the way it works is as you can see I think they bid on it and uh Fabiano starts with black a draw is a win but black has less time so it's Armageddon and I believe time is just going to TI down it's just going to take down there is no more bonus time Bishop D4 remember it's Armageddon so white starts with a 40c Time Advantage but black gets the two results oh my God this is absolutely insane new position by the way this is chaos absolute chaos Bishop D4 Bishop H5 this is this is like poker Knight E2 it's like craps at the casino Bishop Bishop D7 Bishop F3 and C5 and by the way Levon is just down a minute I mean the guy is down a full minute in a format where the other guy can draw the game and oh my goodness this is yeah that's bad news that means that the setup was obviously much more difficult for white Bishop C6 take take and uh yeah Fabby right away from the from the beginning of the game has destabilize the white position leavon is trying to make it a mess Fabby takes gets the Knight into C4 take on F3 oh that is absolutely brutal Rook D3 Knight B1 Queen B1 he moves his Rook out of the way but leavon aronian can play Knight H5 and it is anybody's game I mean queen E4 is apparently winning for black Levon takes on F6 and sacrifices the Knight oh my goodness King takes G7 Knight H5 check Fabiano clutch defending rookie two is the counter punch that he needed and there you you go it is sealed signed and delivered not in that order that is not actually how you say that and then Queen C8 the sniper meets the king F5 white you know white can play out five but there's a lot of ways to win here and uh Fabiano wins the match 4 to3 over leavon aronian and qualifies to play in the finals against Magnus Carlson we're going to get Magnus Fabby a repeat of the 2 18 World Chess Championship oh my goodness I mean this went on for hours and uh Magnus Fabiano is the final
