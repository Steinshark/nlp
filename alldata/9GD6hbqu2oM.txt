- Today I'm gonna do something that's never been done
by any YouTuber ever. I'm going to go to the moon, but first I need to
spend 24 hours in slime, because obviously sitting in slime for a long period is how you prep for the lower atmosphere on the moon. This is going to be one
of the hardest challenges I've ever done because unlike counting to a hundred thousand, this is
actually really disgusting. I'm literally going to be miserable. We used 100 gallons of glue
when making this slime. The problem is the slime is so
heavy, it sank to the bottom so there is a layer of
water on top of the slime, but I promise you 90% of
this is just straight slime and it's kind of annoying that the water was sitting on top so
it doesn't look like it. Honey, where's my super suit? Thank you. We are preparing for the 24
hours in slime challenge. I literally feel like I'm on the sun, but apparently that's
pretty cold so I'll be fine. I am going to spend 24
hours in this slime. If I don't, Jake, you can have a $100,000. I'm scared. Guys, this is disgusting. - You don't like my slime?
- Get in. You asked for this. - For the record, I'm only doing this because I failed the underwater challenge and this is way more disgusting and I really don't wanna do this, but this is to make it up for you guys. Feels gross! Ah! Ah! - Timer hasn't even started yet-
- You can get out now but you have to give me a hundred grand. - Ah, it's cold.
- Two, one. Jump! - How deep is this? Oh my gosh, the bottom is disgusting. - Yeah, I know. - Yeah, that's where all the slime is. You won't need this anymore, 'cause you're not getting out. - I'm not. I swear on my life, I'm not leaving for the next 24 hours. All right, is this it? - This is it.
- This is it. - This is it. - This is it. - This is it. - On cooking with Mr. Beast, we're gonna be making Beast stew. - Ah! You want some slime? This is disgusting. I'm falling. This chair will not stay up. Hey, that's a little bit better. ♪ Tell the world I'm coming home ♪ - Hey man. - Hey, where are you? - All right, we're at Walmart and then we're going to get sushi. - Sounds good. - Wait, is this Jimmy? - No. - Is it not Jimmy? It sounded like Jimmy for a second. - It's 100% Jake. - Oh, well anyways, what do you think about this? - Sounds like a good idea. - It is Jimmy! - No, it's not, it's me. - I swear to God, it's both of you. - All right, we are headed
to go get Jimmy food and other fun things for him. Sushi! - All right. - Sushi, sushi. - We have the smorgasbord. - Oh my goodness. How much sushi did you buy? Wait, let me see it. - $100 worth. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, all right. They're all over there eating sushi, without me. I feel all alone. If I eat this sushi am I gonna have to poop before my 24 hours is up? Whoa! That was really good. Know what we should do? We should go on tour and
just give people shrimp. No... Give people sushi 'cause I don't think - Mid-sentence. - We need to get a sushi
place to sponsor us. That'd be the best. It's time for a movie review. Today's movie review is "Bleach." PewDiePie tweeted out that it was good and PewDiePie's never wrong so
me and Chris will review it. ♪ Movie review, movie review ♪ Can you gimme another piece of sushi? Thank you. - All right, we are
beginning the "Bleach" movie. We'll let you know how we like it. Movie review. The movie was pretty good. The anime that I never
watched was clearly better. Chandler, can you put your phone in front of that thing? I don't think we ever put a phone in front of the camera, so they don't actually
know what time it is. Viewers, can you see it? As you can see it's 6:36. I forgot to show it earlier, but you know, you get the point. I've been in here like, I
think three and a half hours. ♪ Buddy you're a young man ♪ - I'm freezing in here. - Jimmy. We're worried about your hair obviously, 'cause you got that beautiful hair. So we got you this awesome shower cap and we're worried about you
getting the UTI in your weenie so we got you a medical
device, this is not a thong. - You look pretty secure. - My medical device is dripping fluids. - We're also worried
about you getting bored. So we got you a very fun
game called "Speak Out." You ever heard of it? - Oh yeah, actually I have. - Oh, she flopped out. We're not gonna see- - Can I take off my medical device? - You can take off your medical device if you like. - Am I beautiful? - You're beautiful. - This is our mating sound. Does it turn you on? - Yeah. - Bob blurts out famous quotes. - God? - Bob.
- Uh huh. - Bob blurts out...
- Blurts out... - Famous quotes? - Uh huh.
- Ooh. - These are easy. The weather frog observes the warm front. - The weather frog... - Uh-huh. - Asserts...
- No. - No? - The weather frog
observes the warm front. - The weather frog... - Uh huh. - What's that one word after that? - Observes. Observe... Observes. - He's drooling.
- Look at the drool. - I don't know, I give up, Jimmy, Just tell me what it is. - The weather frog- - Tell me what it is! - It observes.
- What is it? - It looks at! - Oh look, he's so angry. - Grr. - He's furious. - Can someone heat this freaking thing up? It's so cold. I'm gonna get hypothermia. Is there any way slime can catch on fire? The slime is getting extremely cold so now we're gonna try
to make a 1000° slime. - Warmer? - No, it feels no different. It's times like this when I
wish we just faked everything. - All right guys, it's
1:30 in the morning. I am going to get Jimmy a pool heater. I'm going to anywhere that's open. McDonald's, gas stations. Hopefully they have one. Hey, do you guys have any pool heaters? - No sir. Do you want some coffee? - Is it hot? - Thank you for your visit, but we are currently closed.
- What? I need a pool heater. My friend is in slime and he's freezing! Hey, I got a question. Do you think a burger
could heat up a pool? - Say what? - A burger, can it heat up a pool? - I'm sorry, I didn't
understand what you were saying. - I'm just trying to heat
up a pool with a burger. That's all. Thank you very much. All right Jim, I got the
hottest burger from Cookout. They said that if you stick
this burger into the water, it literally-
- Can I bite it first? Oh, my God, that is extremely hot. - Okay, so you're ready to be warm? - Yeah. - All right, three, two, one. - Oh, wow. All right, it feels much better now. - Got a space heater for you. It should be warming you forever now. I just have to hold it just like this. - All right guys. Instead of roasted marshmallows,
which are unhealthy, I'm gonna promote healthy eating and eat a roasted pineapple. Oh! Yeah, screw healthy eating,
I want a marshmallow. Watch this. Damage control. - Impressive. - I'm gonna tell you guys a ghost story. There was once a Jake Pauler and he didn't subscribe to Mr. Beast and he stayed a Jake Pauler. Pretty terrifying isn't it, Tyler? - Extremely. - Mr. Beast, tell us
about the T-Series story. - So as you guys know, PewDiePie has been our reigning Lord five years in a row, uncontested. Everyone, from the peasants to
the Nobles, loves PewDiePie. No one questions his reign, but emerging from the west, T-Series. It doesn't even make sense
how fast they're growing. If I'm being honest, I don't
think our Lord will win. It brings tears to my eyes to
see PewDiePie fall like this. When PewDiePie gets passed, his channel doesn't disappear, does it? - No. - Ah, okay, we'll be fine. - Oh, okay. - Dude, what are you watching? - Ah, ah... Can you turn that camera off? All right, you caught me,
I'm watching T-Series. Dude, they're gaining so many
subs, I gotta study them. I don't wanna overthrow PewDiePie 'cause he's our Lord, but
they get a lot of subscribers. Don't tell PewDiePie. Chandler, can you take the viewers outside and show 'em it's dark out? Because they probably think we're lying. Viewers, Chandler's gonna
take you on a trip outside, so you can see how dark it is. - Come on, camera. There we go, I'm going outside. Very dark out. Very. Hey viewers. - Hi. Still here, in case you forgot. Christmas is like a hundred days away and Tyler's gonna put up
Christmas decorations. 'cause it's never too early. Christmas day, I'm uploading a fire video. - Hah, fire. - Ha ha. Is it Christmas time?
- You bet, Jim. - It is? - Yeah. - Hey! Where's Santa? - It looks pretty from here. - You look pretty. So... another 10 hours ish, 11? Making good progress. - Aw, you're not gonna be warm now. - Getting a little too
big for my britches. - Rest in peace. - Now my face feels not as warm. I got so used to it. That's disgusting. pillow, I know. - Good night, Jim. - I've been in slime 18 hours. Can I have some soap? - Here, you gotta loofa it up. - Soap me, master. - I think it's working. You look like a million times cleaner. - I feel cleaner to be honest, which doesn't even make sense, because it's not touching my skin. All right, next it's
time to brush my teeth. But my hands are too gross
to touch the toothbrush. So, can you brush my teeth for me? Dental hygiene is important. Uh huh.
- What was that? - There we go. There we go. Even when you're spending
24 hours in slime, you gotta take care of your teeth, kids. Eight hours and 50 minutes left, or wait no, five hours
and 50 minutes left. Six hours and 50 minutes... Five hours, five hours and 50 minutes. - Six hours and 50 minutes. - Six hours and 50 minutes. - Hello.
- Did you sleep well last night, Chris? - I did, how'd you sleep? - Ah, terrible. I just sat in this slime all night. Chris got to go home like 10
hours ago or 12 hours ago. 14... 10... no, 11 hours ago and I've been here the whole time. - It was pretty nice. - Dude, my hands are literally blue. - Ew, gross. - Don't you just love when your friend calls your hand gross? I have a mission for you. - What's your mission? - Can you go get me a donut? - All right, ladies and germs, I got the donuts so they can go nuts. Jimmy was requesting donuts to make sure that his hunger was sufficed. - Hi Chris! - Hello. I brought you donuts. - Can you put it in my mouth? - All right, open ye wicket. - That's pretty good. - You can finish off the rest of it like a spaghetti noodle, slurp it! Slurp it, slurp it! - No, no! - Please no, no!
- They ask you how you are and you just have
to say that you're fine but you're not really fine. - Why's there so much crap in there, bro? - Tyler happened. We built a campfire in here. - That sounds like a terrible idea. - You want a water? - I'm fine. - You look miserable. - I mean, what do you want me to say? I've been sitting here for 21 hours. I mean... Oh, no, I'm happy. I just wanna sit here and do my time. - Do your time? - Don't do the crime if
you can't do the time. Does that apply to YouTube videos? It's as you guys can see, it's 12:17. We started at 3:00 PM yesterday, so- - 3:06, to be exact. - You know what's gonna feel amazing? - Getting outta here? - That and the shower you take afterwards. A nice warm shower? - Yeah, all right. I'm hype, man. Two hours and 50 minutes and I'm never touching slime until the day I die. All right guys, we have
about two hours left. For some reason, I have
a sudden burst of energy and we're watching "Banana Fish". So if you don't mind, I'm
gonna get back to anime. ♪ Banana Fish! ♪ I also love you guys. All right, play "Banana Fish". ♪ Fish! ♪ What'd you heat up? - Chicken, sausage and panini. - Smells good. I'm gonna buy some... I don't know why I said
smell 'cause I can't smell it but it looks good. - Whoa, whoa. I have a lunch table. Ignore the rain, guys. - More! - Jesus Christ, Aaron, fine! - Can you pause it real quick? I'm guessing that because you're
here, there's an hour left. - Yes there is, Jim. Are you excited? - Kinda. Yes, actually, very. - You want to get out? - Yeah dude, I feel gross. I just feel gross. Dude, is my neck red? - No, it's blue. - No, zoom in on it. - Oh, damn. Oh shoot, it is actually
really red right there. - It's from scraping against the wetsuit. - Yeah. - I've got 30 minutes left. - Exactly 30 minutes left. - Jim, on one to 12, how excited are you
about quitting this now? - Well not quitting, but finishing? Pretty excited. - 23 hours, 59 minutes and 30 seconds. - All right, come on, I want to get out. - We've got 30 more seconds. - Come on, go ahead and get out, dude. - Oh yeah, that's right. - Go ahead and get out!
Just go ahead and get out. - When we started it was
3:06, September 24th. It is currently 3:05, September 25th. - And more importantly,
Shane Dawson just uploaded his new video and I need to
get out so I can go watch that. - It has officially been 24 hours. - All right, yay. Wait, wait, we should
have had something happen. Chris, get naked for
the camera or something. - 24 hours! - Ah, it's so... wet. - How's it feel to be
not in the water anymore? - I still feel like I'm covered in water. Oh, my fingers are blue. I don't know how that worked 'cause it was kind of a green slime. - Oh man, it is warm in there. Oh God, it smells horrible! - All right, I need to go
shower, like five hours ago. Oh, I smell terrible. Ugh! I feel disgusting, why did I do that? Oh yeah, click bait. - All right, subscribe,
like the video, goodbye. ♪ Mr. Beast, oh ♪ ♪ Mr. Beast, oh ♪ ♪ Mr. Beast, oh ♪
