So I thought we'd look at today is how do pop adidas hardest tape store information they all store the data but in terms of electrical signals in silicon, but as basically magnetic data stored on bits of spinning rust So what I've got here is a five and a quarter inch Floppy disk this one's got a copy of small talk on it Probably for PC. It's what small talk small. Talk is the the classic Object-Oriented programming language then what about object-oriented programming then look at one of our arrow videos This is not the word saver icon. This is actually a three and a half inch floppy disk Which is what people are probably more familiar with? Essentially this and this work in exactly the same way That's just easier to see what's going on and why they'll call floppy with one of these when these are produced they put a protective Hard case around the floppy disk and a mental cover to protect the actual floppy Information there so it's easy to see why these are called floppies if you actually take them apart and here's one I destroyed earlier. This is a five and a quarter inch floppy They're also eight inch floppies, and if you actually take it apart, you'll see this is a sort of protective plastic case there We are in and inside that there is a sort of material thing that's actually there to protect the floppy disk Which is this bit, so when the iBm originally created the floppy disk? They originally just had the floppy part like that But they found that dirt and things would scratch it and Destroy the data So they put it in a protective case so that only the readwrite area was exposed to protect the data and the material side Just sort of mopped up any adjuster got in there and stopped it scratching the data and it is literally just a piece of plastic coated in Effectively rust is probably a cobalt based compound rather than iron, but it's basically rust. It's magnetic data I knock so Just like a classic cassette tape or a video tape that you may have used so what have we got well we've got a magnetic Material and the way the computer would use this is actually easier to see with tape so computer tape effectively, the same sort of things is a classic tape you may have seen these in sort of old movies sort of sitting in the background turning and that's exactly what they did if we take the Casing off you have an even thinner even floppy a piece of tape than the actual Proper disc and you can start to see why tape is even still used today because it just holds so much data you think about it the amount of surface area that you can write to on a floppy disk is only going to be a small amount of Tape that you need to store the same thing and yet if you think about the size of this you can get a lot more tape Into the same area well that's someone else do the math on that so you have the tape and you have one side of it got all your data on and another one going to the take-up spool just like an Old reel-to-Reel audio cassette and then you would have a head and I'm going to use the pen to represent the head of the machine Which would sit in contact with the tape and the tape would be pulled across the head as it was Transferred from one spool to the other and that head could either read the data that was on the tape or write the date on The tape and how is actually arranged depends on the tape format? We won't go into the details, but you could basically store bits of information Sequentially on the tape so you start off with the first bit here say than the next bit and so on and as you read through the tape you would store more and more information as I said the Order on the actual day two depends on the tape format This is general principle and as you read through it you get more and more the data Was it would it be one one-line thick or would you be using multiple tracks? There was various different formats. I mean this is nine track tape I think I'm not entirely sure what you sort of had nine track Tape formats you had other ones some of them use helical scan were actually the head is spinning itself and so it's writing stripes across the actual tape like a video cassette does These various things some are linear when they're ready writing in that though actually it literally depends on the tape format most common one today Is called Linear tape whether it's actually still linear I am not certain So you can store a lot of information on this But you have to access it effectively sequentially you have to start at the beginning and move through to the end before you can get To any information that you want on it Which of course takes time if you want the information right at the end here you? Have to spill out all the information on the tape and you can do this relatively fast and Shawn's going to wind all this back up later So only works you have to access things sequentially you don't have easy random access to the data You could do it You could get the computer to sort of work out where how far needs to fast forward and then put markers in the data So you can find different bits, but you still have to wait while it gets to that point? To access it What we disk work? In Roughly the same manner to record Data. I've got a floppy drive here which I've taken apart Eagle-eye viewers may recognize it you still have The heads just here the disk is Popped in and you manually have to close the thing down to lock the disk in place And then there's a motor which spins the disk ground So the disk is spinning round and round around very fast like a cD does so the really important thing is that the head? Can move backwards and forth? Over the top of the floppy so we have two axes of movement here We have the disk spinning, and it'll go in One direction Let's go that way which means that the head is getting the data in a loop So it'll get some of the data as it goes around and round around around and they'll come back again you can start getting the data again, but the head can also move backwards and forward along The dryer which means it can step out or step in to different parts of the disk and so get a different loop or different? Trackers, they're known of Information from the disk if I can draw a circle which I can't hurry up, so this is a disk So we've got the head going up and down which means it can draw Tracks around with this as I said I can't draw circles. Just one more and so the head can step out To each of these track and read a different set of data at each of these different points So protocol this track 0 this would be track 1 this would be tracked - this is the track 3 and this would be tracked 4 so we've now got 5 tracks of information where we can store data So where's on tape we have one long piece of information? And we have to scroll backwards and forwards in it with a disk we have lots of small tracks of information, but the sort of consent along the disk surface And we can step our head to read one of these tracks and because the disk is spinning probably with a floppy like one of those at 300 rPM with a modern hard disk which works in exactly the same way at 7,200 rPM. We very quickly get all the data that's stored on their path under the head in one go so we can specify Which track we want to read the data from and we can move our head to the right point? But we actually go one step further because we actually break the data up into what we call sectors like so And then hami ok I'm not an artist looks like a giant spider's web. It's not yeah I mean, it's the same thing you bisecting the Circle into several slices, we've got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 we have 10 sectors So we say that the data we want to access is on track to Set to 8 and we go to Track 2 and we wait as this spins around until we get the data for sector age Read across and then we might say we actually want the data from track for sector worn so we wait until the Data for sector 1 of Track 4 comes across So if we go back to the drive if we put the disk with our drive on a diagram here And we eliminate it. We've got the sector's around here. The disk is spinning Very very fast so the head just moves Backwards and forwards and say so it's down there their position for track 1 and it waits until sector To say comes across reads the data and then send it out to the computer or take the data from the computer and write it Onto the floppy and so because of that we can access any particular sector of data We want to on the disk because of the nature of a circle surely the inner tracks store less data than the outer tracks so yes They will or maybe they won't it depends on how the disks formats the information a standard sort of PC floppy The inner track store as much data as the outer tracks because the disk is spinning it's not Distance it's an angular velocity, not air So it's got a constant angular velocity So it takes the same amount of time to go around once all that means is the data is packed into a smaller thing But it out at the same speed it probably means the Data is more Likely to get corrupted on the inner tracks rather than the outer tracks on something like a five and a quarter inch floppy Probably depending on the type would either be storing 256 Bytes, Maybe 512 bytes of Data in one Sector of the same on a three and a half inch floppy you'd have 512 byte Sectors, and actually your hard disks work in exactly the same fashion they have tracks They have sectors and they also have different heads and the other thing you get in the hard disk is you just have multiple platters And the reason they're called hard is because they're made out of things like glass rather than after flexible bits of plastic We keep carving away at this and what we'll end up with is something that looks nearly like a cube So we probably may be a bit a bit of extra there and a bit of extra there and there, but we'll get it We're getting there, okay. Now some objects obviously are more amenable to miss than others, but the more images we get the better it is
