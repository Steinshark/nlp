we are going to be building the sickest gaming room on the block now unfortunately my wife was right our plan of doing it with a virtualized gaming server is not gonna work not because we couldn't get the tech right we totally had it it was totally working but because of anti-cheat so we're gonna have to have dedicated gaming boxes for each of the five stations or are we oh I've got some really cool stuff to show you guys from flight DisplayPort kvms and fiber optic cables and and gaming RGB the whole video is brought to you by Govi we're gonna be tricking the room out and I'll be doing all of it with the help of my wife's husband's boyfriend you're you're what our Second Son what they mean okay okay fine all right let's do this this is the current state of the land room I borrowed a couple of laptops from work so that my kids could play Minecraft but other than that it's pretty much just desks now they're pretty amazing desks these are Butcher Block that was sanded and finished with a Danish oil and if I do say so myself I did a great job you did a great job okay last time I felt them they felt like crap did you touch them up awful what what did you sand this with why don't you just get your MacBook out of my gaming center yeah all right maybe just Dan will help today yeah we got Dan helping okay I'll just go home yeah I couldn't finish your desks for you look I did the same finish on my desk in my apartment with a hand sanding block in like a day and it feels way better one desk I don't have seven days this is like the one and a half of those and a hazy solution easy solution lttstore.com yeah okay what are you guys even bringing in here you need headsets catch ah you need I'm not gonna throw this one at you because you'll die but it's metal right yeah that's right the actual keyboards we were intending to use in the land Center everything was supposed to be Logitech Pro oh but um we stole them for the whale land PCS so instead we have these kikron ones they are actually probably like a little bit higher end than those technically speaking cool it used to be that non-cherry switches just use your cherry color scheme but I don't think that is necessarily the case anymore wow why would you do that why are you throwing more what is with these are really valuable mice yeah they're great man this is going to be the most tricked out gaming setup G Pro super lights all around should I do some RGB I mean that's that's all you need for it to be a gaming room is RGB right yeah what all did Govi send over I actually have not seen any of this a little bit of everything so this is just like a lamp I was thinking we put this in the corner it's an RGB IC so that's like a addressable RGB for the PC Gamers uh floor lamp yeah oh that we can put in that corner yeah I have two oh we put one of both parts one in that corner too yeah oh this is kind of cute actually I mean there is some assembly required for this this light but at least in this capacity they can ship it in a small box like this not a giant box not lttstore.com wait darn it we're gonna be shipping this thing soon okay okay is that just the strip yeah oh cool I kind of thought it would be uh stiff yeah well there's this it's like track for it I already mentioned that the virtualized gaming rig That was supposed to power all five of those stations it's out it's done thank you anti-cheat and unfortunately the individual rack mount gaming machines are not ready yet but I still have something really cool to show you guys once those are in my kids and their friends are going to be able to fire up any games they want like they're at a freaking Land Cafe but I want to use them too right and as you can imagine I don't want to share my machine with my kids friends for obvious privacy reasons so we've got a really cool solution to that because my gaming rig and my wife's gaming rig are already down here in the mechanical room anyway and then wired upstairs through Fiber Optic Cables what would prevent us from wiring them up to the land room as well the answer is nothing that is where this comes in now don't get me wrong we make some pretty cool stuff on LTT store but Wendell from level one Tech's lineup of DisplayPort kvms is freaking sick the guy wrote custom firmware for these bad boys so that they can do USB 10 gig and DisplayPort 1.4 up to 8K 60 frames per second to two stations so I just put this bad boy here plug it into my machine and one of our land machines and when I'm in the land Center I can just flip between them the kids friends are over okay you're using the generic one I'm using it I just use my gaming rig with all my files exactly where I want them wow light all right that's cool oh this one also has um warm and cool white LEDs which is nice oh nice so it's not just like that blue you get from mixing all the RGB any rainbow I want rainbow now yes should we fire back at the wall or should we come just straight out no I think fire at the wall yeah okay now I just get a now I just gotta build the other one argaba if you don't want to use your phone Linus it's got a little like just sticking on there it's a little magnet oh cool I don't know that I would want it up there at the top but well that's where it's going for now okay perfect thank you hold on a second what's going on here are we going to put these over in there and use like docs here like for today like we haven't even tested the fiber optic cabling in the walls I mean we could do a couple you want to do all of them I want to know if it works also Dan did you just put the power play mats over top of the LTT desk pad PowerPlay is super cool this is logitech's mouse pad that continuously charges your mouse while you're just using it forever it's amazing you just never ever charge your mouse I just want them to do the same thing for their wireless keyboards so that you don't have to like charge your wireless keyboards now I'm thinking long term uh we could cut out like a piece of acrylic that's that thick that's the same size of the mouse pad and then you'd kind of have a section for it in the meantime there can just be a hump you won't allow it not with the the end yeah move it up to the corner yeah before I can show you guys that KVM in action I need to set up my station starting with the monitor this is the vg27a from Asus and it's basically the gaming monitor that I would have given my left testicle for you know like five years ago it's 165 Hertz 1440p IPS g-sync certified what is there to not like and the 300 sticker price even includes a height adjustable stand take that Apple I really hope this works theoretically every one of these DisplayPort wall plates is wired back to the server room and it should just be as simple as plugging in my machine and the monitor lights up theoretic nothing suffers now I just have to figure out which from this Rat's Nest of wires is that state oh oh they're labeled okay maybe this will be easy I'm gonna guess that five is that one of course not what happened on the one hand I'm upset that the monitor didn't light up but on the other hand I feel great about being right that it wasn't going to be easy got all these like weird profiles we need a VP cable right rainbow mode rainbow that looks RGB right is that RGB enough for you Linus while Jake fulfills our sponsor requirements I am going to take David's suggestion really good idea David and I'm going to plug in this Monitor and see if this one lights up that'll tell us if they're numbered one two three four five or one two three four five crap hey look at these things I wonder if we could make an LTT out of these you think we could do it I don't think it's worth it you don't think it's worth it nope what would you rather say Linus no do you think we can why are those the only two options I don't know you name the company Linus Media Group and Linus Tech tips and LTT couldn't it just be a cool geometric shape yeah okay cool let's do that and L is a shape yeah let's do a big L yeah for great idea Dan oh beautiful it's an elf or narcissist oh baby how's that David is that look awful why this is a big L I'll take it you're taking it right now clearly we made that L out of gobi's Glide wall lights they're the most popular product in govi's Glide series of lights and support the full rainbow of color options Dynamic scenes Alexa and Google Assistant control and they can even sync to music they are all wired up and none of them are picking up a signal okay here he did the same thing he did upstairs where he used these long female to female things we have couplers this is not a couplet yeah I gave them both and clearly yeah why use this well because this is all they had at the start and then they got me the right ones but then I guess yeah did you try the couplers upstairs yeah they work fine yeah so where are the couplers I don't know let's just run the cable to start right to see yeah Dan come on man don't bully line us okay he's a good boy what are the odds the commands oh nice it's just such a small thing but the quality of life Improvement of hanging these with a command strip pre-applied versus having to stick them on somewhere yourself it's really good isn't it so nice they sit Off the Wall a little bit too let me see this God is it bendy it's bendy and it's like diffused should I put these in the middle of my weird things or are we gonna put them somewhere else I don't know I think we need to make a shape out of it look at this guy swoops in at the last second to grab all the glory and plug in the cable exactly who took the plate off me while you're working on that Den can I ask some questions yeah go for it why do you have the power play mats under to the side these mouse pads are their portrait does it matter yeah Nobody Does it yeah you don't have a lump portrait Mouse you get portrait Mouse pattern you get lump yeah no it's actually smart I'm just no what no it's just gonna go here wait wait wait wait what hold on no I see a monitor the power is unplugged are you serious it was like pull it was pulled out wait is it plugged in on the bottom who moved it did someone unplug this one damn unplug this monitor to meme your freaking rgbs I'm just testing hold on I'm just gonna I can try some stuff oh my God it's this one it's this one wait what what the hell it's working through the coupler what number is this though it's either five or one I can't remember this is five or one that's certainly not this should be three what no matter how you remember it could be like one two three four five maybe what I don't know no this is why I unplugged the monitor so you figured it yo thanks Dan you're welcome the plot thickens not only is number five in the middle of the room there's a number six where does number six go there isn't a six station it gets even better there's a not numbered one I am so confused right now these things are a little tricky to figure out how to lay out um there's not a lot of flexibility because it's all straight lines I mean a lot of people are gonna want this look we're kind of thinking maybe it just comes up and then goes over I found it the master key that should tell me where everything runs to so there's one of the patch panels there's other more different patch panel where's the display port play port's not on here actually neither is anything else other than ethernet nothing nothing it's all fine no no grab a hex panel what are you we're not we could we could put the other RGB yeah like going the other way that's a perfect idea not sus at all oh my God I noticed immediately yeah it's not great no I did this on purpose specifically despite him nope no no for those wondering the Cherry rig everything knife is really sharp can confirm and this is going great you guys this is going great thanks man I think so too I can't put into words how thrilled I am with this about what there's no problems at all you can't even see it it's covered up but I think I could express it in math though they have negative numbers right ready yes okay this is four and that's working what what is this numbering scheme because I'm pretty sure this one was like two or something Dan I need your help oh just do your thing keep ruining my walls I have three display ports plugged in and not a single one of these is lit up we know these three I already have these three labels okay but how is there three other ones then there's only five oh I know um there's two remember for the KVM oh so I guarantee you remember because we needed two for the KVM to work right so there's definitely two just stuffed in this access panel I guarantee it do you ever try unplugging it and plugging it back in because I did hi can you should be symmetrical we got two kids we're kind of thinking it comes off of here and goes up sure I mean then again this is the same team that brought you uh ripping the paint off double double wide heck yeah all right um now I need someone to holler at me when it turns off because I have three cables plugged into this thing it's still on one off oh that was it oh wow that was good this means oh my goodness this means the only remaining part of this mystery well we come down here and appreciate that it's bathed in the glow of our RGB light from Govi thank you we'll be performing for this video is are the two extra display ports actually in here I just unplugged the sponsor's light nice two extra fibers two extra display ports and the labels for the extras are one and two why would you have the ones that go into a hole in the wall be one and two that would be that would be six and seven on the planet that I'm from but that's okay I'm sticking it okay that's where it's going okay now we just gotta get a level great we're making patterns on the wall yep very nice love it these things are super cool they do USB one two and three which is more difficult than you'd think over fiber so you plug in all your peripherals your keyboard your mouse your headphones blah blah blah you put that next to your monitor and then this box plugs into the host computer somewhere the frick else like really far away and then you can connect it using any generic fiber optic cable so you can use on three or om4 this is multi-mode fiber and it has an LC connector on it right here and it's gonna work as long as the ones in the wall aren't broken oh cool there is a way to fix the orientation a lot of the designs show them like this and we have them like it is but luckily it knows that you just click 30 degrees boom it actually tells you what port you need to plug it in because it does sort of matter there's an input port and then the rest of the ports you use don't matter but you kind of need to know where your next hex goes and the app tells you which port to plug it into depending on the design you've made in the app which we didn't do ahead of time it would have saved us probably a few minutes at least next panel this is just checking to make sure it's right that's right right right right correct correct correct yay are your lights correctly calculated yes oh that's sick the lights you're seeing here are gobi's Glide hexa lights they're fully customizable to any shape you can dream up in HEX form can display anything from sick Rainbow gamer RGB to soothing static colors and like the majority of gobi's lineup are more affordable than similar products from other companies Dan where Dan go I swear to God who plugs uh who plugs a wall board into a power strip like this last time I unplugged anything you yelled at me so yeah to be fair what do you mean unpl I didn't plug this in look what he's saying is you're a bullied you're bullying him and I will not stand for it I will not Dan for it how's it going that looks High refresh right that's it what did you have to do I just I disabled the other monitor and you know what I think it is that other monitor is a TV right now it's connected via HDMI this is awesome okay can you switch though I that I don't know this doesn't even have a scroll lock button okay bloody hell both left control yeah that doesn't seem to work Jake you still out here for this idea he didn't film what I just said I'm not taking credit yeah we should go test the keyboard to make sure that we actually need to use that Port is what I said yes okay who's even issuing instructions you can see there's an LED on the front you can see if it worked this goes to the monitor in the land room this goes to the what will be the like the land gaming PC this goes to my machine and then basically the two displays the one up there and the one there are plugged separately into my machine then either through the KVM or directly and then they're just cloned in Windows so that whenever I switch over to my computer over there they're just cloned and you know yeah someone sitting up there could see what game I'm playing or whatever but it's my own home like it's there's there's not a privacy concern there the concern that we do have is that it seems like your keyboard and mouse have to be plugged into these console ports let's see if this works control control two oh why am I doing this I'm just gonna call Wendell hello sir is this is this level one tech support do do you manufacture kvms do nice I'm glad to hear it uh hey man I got a quick question you know how there's the hid ports on the KVM and they say to plug the keyboard and mouse in there what if I only live once and I want to plug my keyboard and mouse into a hub that goes into the USBC console port [Music] and there's a USB 3 port on the front and the rear yeah and that's where you want to use a hub okay but will the are the the shortcuts supposed to work like control control one and two and all that nonsense if I don't use the hid ports usually if you use if you snip the protocol um it won't it will interfere with some protocols because it doesn't know if it's a keyboard or whatever else so the hit Port Smiths and the non-hit supports don't miss got it so the answer then is no I cannot plug my keyboard and mouse into the USB 3 port if you want the keyboard shortcuts I've got some extenders that are coming I'm doing the HD if you want to look it up it's HD HD baset is standard for the HDMI people but it'll do USB and HDMI and everything over Cat6 even if the USB 2.0 and a little bit we can almost call it USB 2.1 but not quite oh but I have Cat6 to each of these wait yeah oh my gosh we could totally use the ethernet we could just use the ethernet for a USB extension yes we don't even have to use Wendell's thing we can just buy something else sorry Wendell I didn't even think of that freaking genius man dude I love you you know what that's I'll say it awkward I do my best so we just need ethernet to USB yes to make a little you could probably find a numpad that would work or something like that yeah this is awesome Hey where's the other RGB the thing is let's do it we have some questions so we have the the loosey-goosey one the one thing to consider with these ones is they don't have command strip mounts they're like 3M double-sided tape so if we put it on the wall it's staying in that configuration I was kind of thinking what if we just put it along the back of the desk or on the top of the desk even because it's diffused it looks nice we also have a really long one we can put around the edge of the room right we'll have some standard RGB strips that's what I'm talking about is that the one yeah oh this is cool this one looks sick uh it's a backlight like an Ambiance thing that takes whatever's on your screen and displays it on the wall behind it oh I've seen that kind of thing before it actually is like pretty cool the only thing is it's a very dark wall and you guys already put a bunch RGB back there we'll have more more RGB the reason that this kit is good if you're gaming latency is a big problem right yeah you want to keep your latency low so most kits are a pass-through and you put a little Hub in the middle that captures the color data that's going to add latency this kit and these have little stands too so you don't even have to like these these are the lights you don't have to tell them my goodness there is more light no there's more so there's what oh yeah for the back of the Monitor and there's two little light bars this is amazing so you're supposed to make a shape out of it oh I see something like yeah you can make whatever oh okay so we could do like a heart you know like a live love laugh style I'm thinking just like something kind of like funky and Abstract or something I don't know are you busy you know just working on accounting yeah yeah that's fine just come help I mean you don't need to account I don't need to get paid that's fine you don't need to get paid no okay sure wait I mean I mean Dan doesn't need to get paid so there's I was thinking like like some kind of like abstract squiggle doodad on here on that wall we could put the monitor RGB around Yoda what wait oh we could RGB Yoda yeah yes we could RGB literally anything else RGB Yoda anything else you want I thought that was your aunt well that's what you said last time painted by my aunt yes she's here by the way so I met her she was lovely you told her her painting was awful okay so Jake's doing a weird squiggly pattern um Good Luck well unless Yvonne you have a better idea I don't right now see you later that's what's going on you're all committed because when you pull things off it like takes off the paint oh that looks so cool El wires man if we had more time we could totally like make it it sound reactive look at that when how do you do crab rave I don't know that should we give it a little bit of thought first like are we no I'm gonna start it here right where that I just stuck that one wait what that's where it's starting we are supposed to be done shooting this video in about 20 minutes how's that going everybody we will be done 20 minutes that is not the most symmetrical thing I've ever seen Dan neither am I can I just say that this looks freaking awesome did anyone else actually step back and have a look at this yet this is amazing we've been putting RGB on the wall thank you very much man what a day which actually reminds me we're doing an exclusive series on floatplane.com a day in the life of I think the first one's going to be Riley we're basically like they just follow him around with the camera see what he does all day yeah I'd be curious to know what people do all day around here man this is not a great game to demo this with it's all just the same colors for the most there's different colors look it's like all like gold and stuff is this a bad guy I actually don't you have gray and light gray apparently and gold gray and blue gray yeah what do you guys think I like it what's your favorite color everything okay well that's the color you got right now so you're good really that's it thanks thanks goby goby has a wide range of products including their wall lights hexa lights LED strips floor lamps and much more they're pretty affordable compared to the competitors and they look awesome many of their lights including their Glide series or even a Wi-Fi or bluetooth enabled for smart functionality so check out the links in the description for where you can buy your very own Govi lights kids looks cool right okay there you go kit approved also they're pretty affordable compared to their competitors and you know I think they look pretty cool if you guys enjoyed this video maybe go check out uh previous House video maybe the one where we set up this room and then proceeded to totally trash it in this video which is great I'm so glad I wasn't here for that thanks thanks
