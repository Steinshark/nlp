I'm making this video for you guys on YouTube obviously but I'm also partially making this video for myself as a reminder to do this one thing that I find myself not doing enough very often and that is touch grass like like touch grass for the love of God go touch grass take take your grimy little pause go outside and stick them into the dirt and feel the grass in your hands now before you feel like I'm insulting you or you feel like I'm flaming you for not going out sad enough there is a very particular reason why I'm saying that we need to go out and just and just taste touch the grass touch the grass if you look in my office if you look where I'm at right now you can't see the whole thing obviously but I'm in a dark room with no lights on except for these two lights here and my black curtains so I have good lighting for the video as a Creator and as a programmer these are the worst conditions for Creative thought and don't forget programming is creative thought we're applying technology to creative problems so when I'm either in my office doing YouTube content and I can't think of a video idea or I'm working on an actual work problem for my job and I can't think of a solution I'll literally sit here for hours and just bash my head in with this keyboard because I'm a stubborn person I'm self-taught in a lot of these fields so I've convinced myself that I can solve any problem and I won't go outside I won't take a lap I'll just sit here and be unable to solve the problem and get mad at myself but the minute I go to the gym or I get in the shower or I go take a lap around my neighborhood the solution to the problem or a new YouTube video idea or literally anything will just pop into my head it's actually like the most magical thing that I've ever experienced when it happens I'm literally sometimes in the shower I'm not thinking about anything I am completely brain off and then boom I'll just get a new YouTube video idea or I'll get the solution that I have to a work problem there's actually a significant really important scientific reason for this Dr Andrew huberman for example talks about this a lot on his podcast but essentially your brain is wired naturally to solve problems for you when you're not thinking about them and inversely when you are thinking about them your brain can't exercise its neuroplasticity or its ability to naturally rewire itself so the essentially the harder you think about a problem the less likely you are for your brain to rewire itself and come up with new Solutions or new ways of thinking about it for you now that's obviously not me saying don't try hard don't think about problems but if you're sitting there for eight hours after five days a week 40 hours on the same problem maybe you need just go outside and touch some grass maybe you need to go take a lap go to the gym and just turn off your brain go get some vitamin D which is also necessary for preventing depression and producing testosterone grown for both men and women and uh yeah with a little bit of grass on your fingers a little bit of dirt in your nails you may actually come up with a solution to the problem that you stopped thinking about this segment is low-level rants I kind of just talked about stuff that's on my mind I hope you enjoyed if you did leave a comment let me know and go watch this other rant that I did
