that's good [Music] okay i'm not gonna lie to you prior to learning how to code i probably had very little logical skills experience or my logical thinking was definitely not strong and what i mean by that let's clarify what i mean by that is prior to me learning how to code i didn't spend much time doing math or science or anything that really required more of the logical thinking part of my brain to really be active and be consistently used it was more so uh the creative side of my brain was very working hard all the time that and i mean there's still logic within that but prior to learning how to code i definitely was not a strong logical thinker and i would like to say today you know five years later as a professional software developer a professional software developer is that even a thing yeah it's a thing it just sounds weird i am a professional but as someone who you know codes for money um i definitely think my logic has really improved i hope so no it has really improved and it's really cool to see how much the logical thinking and the skills that i have built through coding and through being in the tech industry really translate into other parts of my life and how i really solve and look at different problems not even related to tech which is pretty cool before we go any further though make sure to hit that subscribe button for more tech and coding related videos leave in the comments other topics you want me to cover i'm here for you i want to talk about what you want to talk about like let's let's connect let's continue to build this wonderful community so leave in the comments any questions you have also i want to say a huge shout out to coding dojo for sponsoring this video as you know from past videos i have done where i speak about dojo i am a huge fan of them i've attended their classes i've spoken to their instructors it's such a wonderful boot camp and i really wanted to share it with you more about it today one of my favorite sayings that coding dojo has is here you won't just learn how to code you'll learn how to be a developer and that's such a huge differentiation between so many places where you just learn how to code versus where you're actually learning the skills to be a developer which is so much more than actually just coding it's problem solving it's where do you find solutions it's googling it's you know interacting with others and the list goes on what really stands out to me about coding dojo is they focus on deep learning they learn that you've learned the fundamentals of programming using the javascript language then you apply those same fundamentals in a different programming language deepening your understanding of them what this really does is it allows you to use concepts in different situations learning how to apply the fundamentals in different situations with different programming languages and that is something you will be doing in the real world another thing i really love about them is their career services unlike other boot camps they give you access to their career services team forever they are truly invested in your career not just getting you a job but getting you the career you want from beginning till you're retired i guess you could say and that is something that is huge because different steps in your career will require different amounts of support i've linked them down in the description so make sure to click on them to go check them out as i mentioned at the beginning of this video when i was first learning how to code or before it i really didn't have to work on my logical skills to the degree i had to when i was learning how to code and it was a big adjustment when i started to learn how to code to think in a logical way and it was something that i had to find ways and methods to really build up my logical thinking skills and really strengthen them the most important thing i would say through strengthening my logical skills my logical thinking skills that i have done is to go back to basics when i started to learn how to code or really anything new now that includes logical thinking or i need to really dive deep in on from a technical standpoint is go back to the basics and fundamentals if you don't have a strong foundation to stand on i know it sounds obvious but so often we just skip the foundations you're just gonna crumble and i think with coding this is something that's so important to be spoken about because when we are learning how to code or learning something new we are so excited that we often skip the fundamentals in hopes of uh really getting to the exciting part or the good part like who wants to spend time reading the documentation and understanding theory and the fundamentals i want to get to like building really cool stuff and that's great but the problem is it's really going to backfire early on once you start building more complex things and you realize you don't have the foundation underneath of you the next thing that really helped me enhance my logical thinking skills was to be consistent to show up every day or on a consistent basis when i'm learning something new or working through a different problem if you want to it's just like going to the gym or doing anything if you want to improve and get better at something you have to repeat and repeat and it's hard to do when you are struggling at first when learning something new or building a new skill set such as logical thinking or building that up and you just kind of want to throw the towel and just be done with it on the hard days but it does get better it does get easier over time you just need to show up you know you owe it to yourself you committed to this and be consistent i don't know if this was the creative side of my brain or just a weird side of my brain but oftentimes when i started learning how to code and my logical thinking skills weren't as strong as they are today i wouldn't properly break down a problem i would see a problem and immediately freak out if i'm being totally honest she's like oh i can't solve this this is someone who i'm swimming on something else and i don't do that anymore thank goodness i would hope not but i i feel like how i've learned to deal with facing problems in a more logical way is to understand that if you break down a problem there isn't something there really isn't anything that you can't solve and i switched that from a frustration feeling to a superpower feeling recognizing that hey there's this problem i'm working on and i'm having a lot of difficulties with it let's talk about let's break it down and sometimes i would even mean going to pen and paper like literally breaking it down what is the problem you are trying to solve how have you tried to solve it so far how can we break this into smaller pieces and it kind of becomes really fun when you look at it from that way and to see that feeling you get once you solve something that the old you or the you know past you whatever you want to call it maybe would have had difficulty solving and you're able to solve it it is such a good feeling like it's so rewarding and it just it's totally worth it and you just have to soak up that feeling and remember it for next time you face something that you might have a little bit of a challenge with the next thing that really helped me improve my logical thinking and i know i sound like a broken record at this point but it's because i wish someone would have kept on reminding me to do this is to ask questions when i got my first job in tech i so often would think that i had to know everything and i was too nervous to ask any questions and thought they hired me with expectations that i will know everything no they hired you knowing where your skill level is at like they saw you in the interview they know what you can do there's no surprises here you didn't fool anyone it's you're your authentic self if you were in the interview you will be at the job as well and remembering to ask questions and just stay curious and that's probably one of the biggest takeaways that i have been able to continue to grow my logical thinking and really strengthen it is to be curious want to learn more want to grow and be okay with asking silly questions because i do think there is such thing as silly questions i really do but i don't think there is such thing as questions that you shouldn't ask i ask silly questions all the time things that i should know every day i'm like crap why can't i remember that and if i look it up and it's not coming to me right away just ask someone on your team because they will tell you in two seconds and you can move forward with your work versus you know feeling this is a silly question i'm not going to ask it and beating yourself up no like we need to keep on moving forward and keeping things rolling and to do that we need to communicate and ask questions i feel like i'm preaching to myself as much as i am speaking to you because it's a reminder i often need as well as to to ask questions but it's so important and so true and i think some people think when i talk about logical thinking and logical uh building up your logical thinking some people i've gotten comments before that they think it's something that you have or don't have and i really disagree with that i think some people naturally have more of it but i do think it's something that if it is important to you and you want to go into a career that requires logical thinking that you can develop over time for sure no questions asked about that but i just want to say that because some people sometimes say tiff you can't develop logical thinking you're born with it or you're not and i really disagree with that but you just have to find the ways that are best for you to to learn and build new skills because it's different for everyone okay those are my main tips for improving your logical thinking at the end of the day it's no secret it's just like anything in life you need to continually work at it ask questions and grow your skills and over time you will see results it just takes time so be patient with yourself i hope you found this video valuable and helpful make sure to leave in the comments other videos you want to see and if you haven't already make sure to check out codingdojo i link them down in the description as you know from past videos i have done where i speak about them i'm a huge believer in coding dojo and if i was to do it all over again you would see me at coding dojo thanks everyone [Music] you
