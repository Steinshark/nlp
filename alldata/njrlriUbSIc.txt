and i it's only weird like i said for someone who creates a weird little distinct category called religion a category that they don't understand a category that they can just like uh count off as superstitious and stupid and ridiculous although it's a human universal and it makes them feel safe that they don't have to understand this and then it makes them blind to all these other behaviors that human have that are ritualized and that could be really understood if they took a little bit of time [Music] [Music] this is jonathan pedro [Music] welcome to the symbolic world [Music] two weeks ago now i'm not even sure time really flies some guy that i never heard of who runs a podcast called decoding the gurus i guess uh kind of went after me on twitter at first he was going after brett weinstein but then decided i guess to go after me and uh anyways he he has the usual kind of you know dismissive new atheist tone and i was gonna ignore the guy but then uh david fuller from rebel wisdom and uh other people that i respect you know said that uh this is important that i should pay attention to it but really i'm not gonna i'm not gonna answer too much but one of the things that this guy uh attacked me on is here's one of the tweets he said he's talking to david fuller and he says here jonathan pedro saying alex jones intuition are absolutely correct that abortion is a human sacrifice for power and that he would not be at all surprised if the elites were engaged in you in ritual sacrifices and so this was of course his big proof that i am uh off that i am off the rails that i'm some kind of guru or some you know that i that i'm not worth uh the attention and so what i thought is i realize in reading it that of course this i don't think this guy could understand what i'm talking about but i thought it could be a good opportunity to maybe talk about sacrifice and maybe help people understand as much as i can help you understand what sacrifice is why we sacrifice and even why human sacrifice exists and we'll see if in the end that that tweet or these comments that i made about abortion and human sacrifice hold up once we've gone through the basic uh the basic ideas one of the issues that we see with a lot of these kind of new atheist types and this kind of new atheist rhetoric is that they often act as if religion is this thing completely set aside in human behavior and so they create a box called religion and then they look at what's going on there and they they uh they just see it as some kind of aberration or some kind of strange behavior that humans are having and because they don't they don't seem to want to connect the ritual let's say religious behavior with other types of behavior or other types of regular behavior that humans have then they find it very strange when other people do that when i let's say if i try to explain how certain behaviors today are akin to sacrifice i've done this not only in terms of abortion but in terms of in terms of war for example i've talked about uh how we'll get we'll get to it i've talked about how certain acts in war are very much akin to human sacrifice and so that's the problem it makes it very difficult to engage with these types of people because they're not really trying to understand why people would sacrifice in the polish like how did this happen how did humans start to sacrifice once you start to ask those questions then all of a sudden you get larger categories of human behavior and you can you're able to understand why it would happen that sacrifice would be developed and why it is delusional it really would be a strange delusion to notice that sacrifice is a human universal but that today for some reason we don't do that anymore nobody does that anymore nobody sacrifices and of course nobody uh participates in human sacrifice because you know we're so evolved that we would never do something like that but i think that's really the blindness of not understanding what sacrifice is what what it's for and so we're going to look at that and see if we can figure out on our side why it is that sacrifice exists now in order to understand sacrifice we really need to go back down into very very primal categories of what humans do because sacrifice is a very very inc it's a large and encompassing uh category and several thinkers have been poking at it and trying to find solutions at why humans do this different theory anthropologists or or religious thinkers have tried to kind of figure out why it is that humans do this um and i'm gonna give you my take at it i don't necessarily think that it's all encompassing but i do think that it does encompass quite a bit of why it is we could get to the get to this now we have to go all the way back all the way to the very bottom of activity of what a let's say what a being with agency does and why it does what it does and the way that i try to think about it that brings it all together is to understand that most of what we do or possibly everything that a being with agency does has two basic goals um and it has these goals have to do with identity they have to do with the notion of being a being rather than not right to just existing as a being is what we have to come down to in order to understand sacrifice so we understand that when beings act in the world they act for two major reasons one is to protect the integrity of my being and the others is to expand my being now expand my being can be something like adding body adding potential but of course when we get to conscious beings and to higher level beings we'll see that that also has to do with something like influence it can also be a more subtle type of expansion not necessarily also if not necessarily just a physical expansion but a more subtle one and we also can understand that expansion of being even as something as lineage you know as something like my children as an extension of my being and that my children become an extension of me and so i i can act in a manner to to protect and to expand the things that are related to my being we'll see how that scales up also rather quickly into higher beings even than humans in terms of families um and and different higher beings so we get to this basic idea so why is it that i engage with the world you know i either try to to stop things from hurting me to prevent things from destroying the integrity of what i am or i'm also either expanding myself or taking things from the outside and bringing them inside in order to preserve and to expand what i am um so we get now to because we're going to talk about mostly about sacrifice in terms of killing animals but there are other types of sacrifice but we're going to start with there it makes more sense so the question is why do we kill things you know why would humans kill things and when you think about it the way that i explained it you realize that humans kill things for those reasons human humans kill things either to protect themselves so right there's a predator there's something attacking me you know there's a there's a mosquito biting me there's whatever it is that is attacking me and so i will kill the thing in order to to preserve my body or i also kill things in order to integrate them for food and to expand my body but i could also kill things in in in order to expand my influence and my presence as well right if there's a predator hunting on my on on my land and he's killing the animals that i want to kill then i might kill that predator in order to have more access and to expand my my scope my influence you know my my capacity to take up to to to to exist in the world let's say um so you see that of course it's not just killing anything we do whether it's the you know the grass we pull out of the ground whether it's the wood we cut will always be about this as well and you can then scale that up and you can understand that this is what this is what happens when you kill people as well when you kill people you will do it for those reasons you will do it either to protect yourself if there's someone attacking me there's someone dangerous to me i feel like i have to kill them in order to preserve my being or i will also kill in order to expand to take things from others to invade other lands you know if i'm jealous of someone i want to take what they have or at least want to eliminate them as rivals for what we're both looking for so you're going to start to see that i think that my theory about sacrifice is ultimately going to be more encompassing even than gerard's theory i think so it might be a little cocky on my on my end to say that uh but we'll see you'll see that i think that it it it involved but looking at renigiral's theory is is of course extremely uh useful to help you understand but first we also can also understand that we have to ask ourselves first of all how we engage with things outside and then also why would we give things to others so because sacrifice involves those two things it involves taking things from the outside taking you know either killing things or taking uh different things that we've gathered and giving them to others so why would we do that and my my uh i surmise that the reason why we do that is the same as why we kill and take things in the first place is we do it either to you know expand ourself or to protect ourselves but then the expanding and protecting happens humans one of the things that humans realize is that they also exist at higher levels they also exist in groups they exist in higher level beings let's say they don't only exist they exist in families in clans and all of this they don't only exist on their own and so they'll realize that as an individual being it will at some point be worth sacrificing what i have giving away without what i've gathered giving away what i've killed in order to assure at now a higher level the same thing the preservation or expansion of the the higher layer level beings that i participate in whether it's my clan my family whether it's a group and then ultimately whether it's a nation we'll also see that that sacrifice will kind of happen in two directions we could say one going up or maybe three directions let's say one going up one going down and then one maybe going side to side in terms of gift giving with friends so the one going up will be something like you know something that you see already in the animal world which is that if a pack of wolves kill uh kills something then the alpha wolf will have first access to the food so there's a sense in which we understand that when we exist in higher level structures we have to give a part up into that structure in order to preserve the the preserve the strength of the common being and so the king gets a part of what i make you know this is what taxes our taxes are basically a form of sacrifice where we offer up to the higher being which is the king or the state or something which is above us in order to preserve our existence to expand our influence now this you'll realize that once once humans realize that this works that if i give a part of what i have up towards towards a higher level being my family my team my clan or whatever that this can also be ritualized and can be given up to the reason why we exist in the first place so this is what giving giving things to a god is it's actually a more economic way of all of us binding together and giving a part of what we have up up towards the ideal of why we exist together so that it that that ideal will then come back down and will let's say will hold us together in a way that that binds us but we'll see a little more about that as we go first i want to look a little more at gerard's theory now gerard's theory is wonderful because he kind of gets what i'm saying and he realizes that in order for groups to exist together they have to care for the same things and this is actually the very existence of an of a group i mentioned this before in order for a group to exist we have to have one purpose or one ideal any group whether it's you know a group of people working on a prototype in a company whether it's a baseball team or whatever sports team or there is something there is something we care about all of us care about that binds us towards that care binds us to that thing now you can imagine that there are multiple things that can do that and there can also be a hierarchy of things so we we let's say we care about certain things and then at a lower levels we also care about secondary goods as well so we can understand that in a group certain things become valuable certain resources you know women children all these things become valuable and then because we all care for the same things then it binds us together but it creates of course a problem because when we care for the same things the resources are limited the possibility of accessing these things that we care about are limited as well so what will happen is that will create rivalry and competition within the group and so the very thing that binds us will create competition and rivalry and so this is a serious problem because what it can do is it can lead to all-out conflict where everybody starts ripping each other apart through through cycles of revenge you know i i'm jealous of my neighbor so i kill him to take his wife or to take his stuff but then his family notice see that i did that then they take revenge on me and so you have these eternal cycles of revenge and so we have to find ways to con continue to cohere or else groups will just fall fall apart and cease to exist and this will happen through ritualized behavior and so just like you know just like a a dog will ritualize a conflict in order to avoid killing each other they will ritualize aggression ritualize submission and then they'll create a ritualized encounter in order to avoid the cost of it boiling down all the way into all behavior for the same reasons humans also do that it's there's nothing weird even for an atheist to understand that ritualized behavior is a is a way in which to avoid the cost of a certain social dynamic and to to bring it higher into bring it up to its pattern in a manner in which it will then let's say order reality and not be as costly in the at the at the bottom of things um so what gerard noticed is that what people would tend to do is that they would take all the problems in the tribe all of the things that were breaking the tribe apart and they would end up focusing it finding someone who was weak who was diseased or someone who just didn't fit in sometimes it would actually be a stranger like an enemy prisoner someone who's not part of the group or is almost not part of the group and then they would say well it's because of that person because of this person that the group isn't going together right it's a scapegoat behavior so they would they would put all the blame on the person the the scapegoat they would say that it's this person's fault that i'm not able that we are not able to reach what it is we care about because they they are in the way they're not they're not they're oddly not buying they're not binding the group they're not participating in the man in which the group binds together they would put all the blame on that person they would kill that person and then it would rebind them towards what it is that they cared about they would it would create a kind of ecstasy and a um it would create a kind of an ecstasy and a kind of moment where the group would feel in acting together in violence towards the scapegoat that they recognize each other as one they recognize each other as being something that exists in the world um this is this is um this is difficult to understand for people who think that groups just exist groups don't just exist beings don't just exist they need something to bind them together for them to exist and that has a mechanism and if you don't understand it then there's a lot of stuff about religion that you will never understand because you somehow think that people just exist together without ways to bind in order for them to to to to move towards common uh goals and common things that they care about um so what you would you realize is that this gerard's theory works very with perfectly with my idea that basically the way in which a group acts will be a way in to act in order to bind themselves has to do with identity in in binding and creating a hierarchy and identifying an outside right we take something on the edge we take something strange we we kill it we basically cast it out and then that ejects that which is not good that which is outside of us in a ritual way and it binds us together towards something um and so you can do that of course you can understand that this is already what happens in the very existence of the group in the patterning of attention this is what is already happening it is in order you know i've mentioned this before let's say in order for a basketball team to exist as a basketball team it has to be able to sacrifice it has to be able to focus its attention on a common goal to identify the things that are the obstacles to which for to reach that goal and then to eliminate them and so if there's a bad player on the team they will get rid of the bad player if there's bad behavior on the team then they will eliminate behavior and so you realize that actually sacrifice is the very way in which things exist it's for anything to exist it has to sacrifice some aspect of its idiosyncrasy in order for it to exist together and this is going to sound weird for people to understand but in order for you to understand the existence of objects of of any being you realize that the pattern of sacrifice is embedded in the very existence of all objects because even though i recognize this as being a cup it has indefinite idiosyncrasy in it which is which could make it not a cup that is not participating in his cupness you could say but in order for me to recognize it as a cup i have to sacrifice the idiosyncrasy even in my attention i have to i have to not pay attention to the things that are idiosyncratic in the object so that i can experience it and participate it in it in a way that is to its purpose in the way in which it is to the reason why i care about this thing in the first place which is that i use it to drink out of um now of course there are ways to play with this there this isn't there are ways in which sometimes a little bit of of of idiosyncrasy is part of the pattern we've talked about this in other videos i won't go into it right now but as a basic pattern we have to understand that that is how things exist through sacrificing idiosyncrasy and also let's say the the different aspects of the group have to give aspects of themselves up in order to participate in their higher being all right so it's a good way to understand emergence in general all right so we understand that this is the basic idea of how gerard works and you can understand it as a good way of understanding how all things exist and the idea is that mimetics sacrifice the way that gerard defines it is useful but i think that gerard really focuses on the scapegoat part but what you realize is that there are many types of sacrifices which will participate in things existing and they don't all fit with the notion of mimetic sacrifice you can understand like i've said the the idea of giving up right the idea of giving up towards our identity is not exactly the same as memetic sacrifice so we we get taxes is the best way to understand sacrifice up the hierarchy towards toward higher level beings um but there's also a way in which we sacrifice down in which the higher level beings will also give part of itself down to the lower beings i've mentioned this before you see that of course in the idea of the emperor giving bread to the masses you know you see that also in the sense of let's say the state offering uh services to the people and so taking that which has which is how it has received but also not just using it for its own self-existence it has to give back down towards the group so imagine a king for example that takes taxes and then the king doesn't do anything for the people at some point they're going to kill the king at some point they're going to get rid of him but if the king offers protection and offers that which i talked about in the outset which is to maintain the identity of the group to maintain it towards a purpose that the group cares about then people will accept to give up to the higher being in order to receive back down a kind of order a kind of structure and protection from the outside and so but the king has to offer that he has to sacrifice back down towards the group in order for the so this is the type of exchange that happens um so you can see that often in the uh ritualized sacrifices you'll see that this is happening at the same time where someone will take an animal that is usually you know a good animal like the best animal something unblemished or something and they will give up towards the god that binds the group together but then that will already immediately come back down on them and then they will eat the meat of the sacrifice and so we give up and then we receive at the same time and this might seem weird for people because they think you know it's like why are you giving it up to god why don't you just eat the animal but we have to understand that ritual behavior is a way to bind us towards a common purpose and towards the common reason why we exist together and so when we know that everybody is doing this everybody is offering up a sacrifice to the thing that binds us together to the identity that binds us together and then ritually we then all engage in the bounty that that offers us then we are binding each other to binding together as a community so this is this is i know people are now i know atheists are going to freak out they're going to be like what this doesn't make any sense but you have to understand it fractally you have to understand it this is what we do all the time right we imagine a family you you invite your family over for dinner and then everybody brings up a meal everybody brings some food everybody brings a dish and then we all put it together towards the thing that binds us together which is that we are a family and we exist together with a common care and a common identity and a common purpose and then as we all put that together and we offer it up to the to our family then it comes back down and we sit at a table and then we celebrate what are we celebrating we're celebrating our family we're celebrating the thing that binds us together and so we we offer up food we sit together at a table and then we eat together and you say well why don't you just sit at home and just eat just take food and eat it you know why would you do something like that and this is where people don't like i said people are ignorant of why it is that humans exist together in the first place and so ritual sacrifice that is offered up to a god is one level higher than the type of behavior that you engage with when you are getting together as a family for thanksgiving and everybody bringing some food and then eating together you know and there's a and it's and it's important because if you don't eat the food then your family is it's a it will be an image of your family not being together by the way i hope you know that right if your aunt brings some food and nobody eats the food that the one on brings then that will uh reflect the manner in which her sacrifice is not accepted her sacrifice is rejected and that she is not not really bound together in the proper way and you know that that's true by the way if you have a family that you actually care about you realize that this is something you have to think about um and so you can see that so you can see different versions of this you can realize that the there are different types of ways in which this happens so for example ritualized manners in which you give towards authorities in order to avoid the problems the best way to understand it is of course the tribute because you imagine that a king comes into your land he's not really your king yet and he basically demands tribute he says give me this amount every year and why is he saying that it's a racket right he's saying that because he's it's protection money he's saying pay me this this amount every year and if you don't then i will come and i will pillage your land and i will rape your women and i will take your children and so the ritualization of the behavior will avoid the cost of it at the ground it will avoid the king having to have his soldiers die it will avoid the people having their people died and killed and raped and it will become a ritualized manner in which we sacrifice one part of what we have up to this higher level authority that is coming to us in order to in order to to to impose its authority on it so this is not good or bad guys this is not about sacrificing is good sacrificing is bad it's just about how the world works this is how the world works and you can't get away from it this is this is just the manner in which you in which in which it works um so it helps you really see the double-sidedness of of all of these authorities of all civilization of all of the manner in which uh authority structures exist are always double-sided you can see the positive aspect in which you know the idea that the king will cover you and will protect you or the state will cover you and will protect you in order to in order to hold your identity together but you can also see it how it can become tyrannical and it can be uh basically protection money that you have to pay or else they're going to put you in jail so pay your taxes or else you go to jail even if you don't believe at some point authority becomes inescapable in the world um all right and so we have to then understand that the the word the dif direct relationship if you see that there's a relationship between human sacrifice and war you know you can see that when you fight a war once again people think that identities exist just just exist they don't just exist i have an identity i have a city i have a clan i have things a group of people that i identify as having one identity and now all of a sudden that group that i identify as one is threatened by a group on the outside now why do i care why don't i just give in and cease to exist and become part of that other group because i care about these things i care because also if i am taken over by another group i will lose the the value of what binds me together i'll become a slave for the other group i'll become a lower part of the the group that's attacking me and so i want to preserve my identity i want to preserve the identity of my group and so i understand in war that i am willing because i don't know what's going to happen right if i am if i am a group and i'm attacking another group in order to expand my identity expand my power expand my influence expand my glory i don't even know i don't know what's going to happen but i i am betting on the future that i am willing to sacrifice members of my group in order to reach that goal that i care about and the same goes for the protective side i'm being attacked by another group why don't we just scatter why don't we just run away why don't we just why don't we just you know cease to exist and i'm like no i want to continue to exist and i am willing to sacrifice members of my group i'm willing to kill them for this higher purpose in order to continue to exist as a group and so there's a com there's a direct relationship between war and human sacrifice and we understand it if you look at the different rituals that happen in the manner in which human sacrifice was practiced in different civilizations you will really you will realize that that is the case you will realize in the things that we recognize more let's say more directly as being human sacrifice which is the notion of uh ritually killing someone in a in a very formal way that it is just a way to avoid the cost of of the the normal protection and let's say expansion of my identity and so that is why for example you can understand that let's say when the romans took over gaul took over a certain amount of of of the country they realized that they also don't want to totally decimate the other people and take over their land there's something it's not even to their advantage to do that because those are resources that they that they want to use so in order to mark their authority in order to stop the killing one of the things that they will do is that they would they would sacrifice their enemies so they would take some people some some of the leaders or they would take a certain amount of people from the from the enemy group and they would ritually kill them in order to mark their the way the man in which they ruled that group in order to mark the expansion of their authority to declare it to say we have we have taken over this this land we have taken over these people we've taken over this power and you see that this happens in many uh many uh civilizations where the killing of a slave for example or the killing of an enemy a captured enemy is part of the behavior because they want to mark the their power on the other but they also want to limit the cost they don't want to just slaughter everybody um and this is real politic guys like i'm not i'm not skimming skimping at how the world works um but what you realize is that sacrifice is inevitable you know that it is part of identity itself and once you realize this you realize that it also explains a lot of other types of sacrifices which is for example the sacrifice of food and so sometimes we it doesn't have to always have to be meat it could be grain it could be all kinds of things the pouring out of libations all these types of sacrifices will be ritualized ways of marking a giving up either up towards the the higher purpose of the group in order for all of us to recognize that we are bound to this to this um it's about attention that we are bound to this purpose or down sometimes you also give down to to your fallen ones you know this idea of pouring one out for the lost for the lost ones where you pour out a drink on the ground in order to commemorate the dead you can understand that this is also a manner in which to preserve the memory of our group to preserve the idea that we are together by remembering those that are fallen and creating once again this sense of cohesion not just in space but also in time with the people that were that preceded us and so giving out food to the dead is a manner in which we can remain bound to them through the all through the sacrifice of something that is precious to us all right all right so i'm not going through all of it but hopefully you're starting to see how this is how this works and how why it is that sacrifice is part of of human reality in the the ritualized sacrifice you end up having different types of sacrifices you can imagine that in terms of especially in terms of human sacrifice you can imagine that there is the scapegoat sacrifice that i talked about but that there's also like the sacrifice to found a city so you realize that a lot of civilizations participate in human sacrifices in order to found cities in order also to found houses so you find under houses the under posts let's say that hold up houses you will find human remains of people that were killed or sacrificed and put under the house of in order to hold the house up so of course we're all materialists we're all we're all scientists and so we think that that's superstitious why would you kill someone and put them under the post of a house to hold up the house and this is of course where we struggle to understand different types of causality we don't understand that if you make if you put something precious as the foundation of your home if you sacrifice something precious in order to bind even a building together even uh even even a family together then that will hold it and it will it will hold it not through weird superstitious means it will hold it through attention it will hold it through the knowing of of and there's it can become quite subtle but nonetheless there's even if just the person that does something like that understand what they what they paid the price that they're paying in order to exist together in a home in a house in order for things to to bind together then they will do it now i'm not trying to defend human sacrifice i obviously do not do not believe in human sacrifice i'm a christian i think that the the story of christ has solved the problem of human sacrifice because there is something itchy about it and we realize that we realize uh as we look at how it develops and moves towards animal sacrifice and then moves ultimately towards more subtle forms of sacrifice that there's a refining of the sacrifice system but to simply deny it and think that it's completely it makes absolutely no sense and not to understand that why it is that why it exists is also being extremely naive and not understanding how it works um and so you can understand how people would sacrifice things in order to get from higher authorities and that would be ritualized into the sacrifice to a god a sacrifice to a god in the sense of the god as the principality as the top of what it is that binds us together and so just to to go back over what we talked about just in terms of going back over the idea that there are different levels of ritualization in killing all killing is is to a certain extent ritualized because it is done with a purpose and therefore has to be done towards that purpose but there are different levels of ritualizations of course uh in killing and you can understand how this is what happens in the animal kingdom itself where it's and even you can realize that it's not just even about killing sometimes you don't even kill sometimes you can create the pattern of sacrifice in a manner which is dedication and so you see that in um in scripture for example where people would dedicate themselves and uh to the temple for example you see that in in scripture where you know someone is given to god and that person lives in the temple and then becomes a servant of the temple the idea that uh you know you would give up your your men toward to be in the army and so you give up at least one of your sons will become a priest for example these are ways in which we understand that when we talk about even human sacrifice it doesn't necessarily mean that someone has to die but it means that that we give up someone to a higher good and then that binds us together so the idea of let's say you know this idea in catholic countries where every family kind of had to have one member of their family uh become a priest let's say was this kind of giving up towards a higher purpose um but of course you see that even just an animal in animal uh in animal behavior where an animal is killed and then the best part of that killed animal will be given up towards the the alpha male let's say um we talked about scapegoat sacrifices and we have this idea for example in scripture that the firstborn is dedicated to god and you can understand how in some cultures this type of thinking would lead to actually killing your firstborn which seems crazy to us but we have a sense in which the firstborn has to kind of embody in a way the highest ideal of our family and i know that this is gonna sound weird but there's a sense in which the best part is given up towards the the the the ideal and so that's where you can see why that's where you can understand also why there is that in in war where we have the sense in which we give up our best men in order for them to to fight and to die for the cause of our nation this is there's very little difference between the two it's just that one is more ritualized let's say than the other and will usually also lead to less killing because in a war there is ritualization but it can become very messy and you and the number of people that die and then under people the number of people that end up getting sacrificed for the unity of our group is much larger than than in human sacrifice so you can understand why in human sacrifice there was a way in which this was a way to have an economic way of killing in order to attain the goal that something like war ends up attaining um all right and so you can understand how in different cultures then there would be there would also be initiation sacrifices and so there are many examples of that for example the spartans when the the spartan citizens reached a certain age of initiation one of the things that they would do is there would be a certain amount of time in which they were it was fair game to kill any servant in the land and so the spartans would go out and they would murder as many serfs and as many as many slaves as they could in order to mark their capacity to be a spartan it was an initiation sacrifice we see that of course in different gang initiations and the legends of gang's initiation some of them are maybe not actually embodied but the stories of them still kind of imbibe our culture you know you have this idea that if you're a member of the aryan brotherhood or whatever you have to kill a rival in order to participate in order to be a member sometimes you don't necessarily have to kill to be a member but if you do kill a rival gang member or if you kill someone from another gang or if you even kill an innocent person then that will make you go up in the hierarchy that it becomes a form of marking the outside by killing that which is outside or eliminating something which is weak inside the group a rival that you're able to beat in order to make the group stronger and to bind you together and there's also a manner in which acting in that scandalous way this is something that you see in mimetic in mimetic sacrifice is that there's something about doing something horrible like killing another human being that you recognize as being a mirror of you right you humans are different from animals because you see in their face a mirror of yourself and so the idea that to go into something as scandalous as killing another human being and doing it as a group or doing it for a group becomes the ultimate marker of participating in a scandal by which we exist together this is of course especially true in criminal organizations where the idea that if you're willing to kill someone in order to be part of this group then we can trust your we can trust the fact that you care about our group more than anything else that this is what you you completely uh care about and so killing becomes a very powerful tool for any kind of criminal syndicate it it offers all kinds of solutions to the problem of existing in an illegitimate and uh and a uh in something which is illegal and something which is criminal is that if you get people to kill others or you make it part of the way in which you scale up the hierarchy of a criminal organization then you are not only participating in a scandalous act together but you are you are also making them dependent on you because you know that they killed someone and that this binds them to you in ways that are more than one let's say you know by part by knowing about this person's scandal then they also become they owe you because you could always denounce them you know you you you share something together which is the knowledge that you've all killed someone together that you've all killed someone so these are all ways in which uh initiation sacrifices are a way of participating in human sacrifice that that works like it actually works in order to bind a group together it's horrible uh but it works and so you realize that in the gospel of saint john we have actually a you act you actually have a uh a very short definition of what it is that sacrifice is human sacrifice especially and you have it when uh when the the sanhedrin are questioning or wondering what to do about this jesus fellow and because they can see that jesus is causing problems you know through the the turning over of the the tables in the temple through the resurrection of lazarus he's attracting a lot of attention to himself to the jews they're scared of the romans they're scared about also the people what the people are seeing and how it's it's it's destabilizing their group and so you know the one of the members of the sanhuita says you do not realize that it is better for you that one man die for the people than that the whole nation perish and so the idea of being able to eliminate one person you know by for by the sanhedrin killing this one person they would be one marking their allegiance to rome by saying we're denouncing a traitor right they're also binding themselves together by participating and killing this ultimately innocent person all of this is happening at the same time they realize that by doing this then they will bind themselves together and so in this case of course you realize that in many civilizations this type of function when you realize that until very recently the executions were always public so the public execution is a way is another form of human sacrifice where we kill someone in public we make sure everybody sees that and we realize that by doing that we are going to mark the limit of behavior in our society in a very dramatic and and uh and powerful way of course political assassinations are that as well we realize that if i can just kill this member of this enemy team this enemy group of this enemy nation if i can just kill bin laden then there will be less bloodshed so i will we will bind together to kill this one person in order to bind to to preserve the identity of our group because we realize that if we do that then we don't have to go to war or the war that we are having with the other people is going to be diminished by killing the the these few people let's say and this is going to be very controversial but there is a manner in which the the watching of george floyd dying the killing of george floyd ended up being something like a human sacrifice it ended up being something like someone dying and then binding care together and trying to create a social cohesion under the death of one person so george floyd gets killed and then people massive people all over the world demonstrate in the street for days and days and weeks cities you know there's a sense in which there's this catharsis which happens that is exactly the type of catharsis that would happen in any in any kind of human sacrifice but strangely enough it's it's it's actually closer to the christian version of of human sacrifice because there is a serious problem with sacrifice you know and what it does because it is nonetheless the ritual there's something which when we look into the face of another human being and we see that mirror there's something about killing someone else which is very different like i said from killing an animal and so there's a manner in which seems like in human culture there was something bubbling there was something bubbling up to help us understand that there's something off about the manner in which we we do that there's something in the the the reflection of myself and the other which makes this type of behavior something unacceptable and this is of course what ultimately leads to this is what why rene jihad says that the fact that in the story of jesus christ we see the ritual scapegoat sacrifice from the point of view of the one who is sacrificed that it actually collapses and completely resolves in a manner the problem and the reality of the scapegoat sacrifice because the victim of scapegoat sacrificing is often innocent because the problem of desire is there in the group and so we the fact that we throw all our the sins of the group onto one person is of course too much for that person to bear and this is this is a it's a it's somewhat like a momentary binding but it's a cycle like this constant cycle of you have to keep doing that over and over in order to refresh and to rebind you together now in the christian story we have a sense in which as we take the place of the sacrificed one as we we take the position of the sacrificed one then it it is actually revealing the mechanism of the scapegoat sacrifice and in a way heals it or recast it in a different manner and it also i've talked about this before it actually exposes a secret about reality which is that the true manner in which things bind together and hold together is through self-sacrifice it is not through sacrificing other things although it works but ultimately we realize that it is if i want my family to bind together i have to sacrifice my idiosyncrasies to the common goal i have to give myself to the love that exists in my family and that is the proper way for a family to exist i could find a a black sheep in the family we could have one of the the chil one of our many children in the in the the family represents the black sheep they're always to blame it's always their fault it's always they're the ones who are responsible for all our woes and it works right it actually will bind it together but it will leave this residue this dark residue on the outside and what that does is it creates the cycle where it has to we have to keep this black sheep there or recast it into someone else in order for the group to continue to exist what what the christian story reveals is that the proper way the best way for a group to exist is that if we all if we all sacrifice ourselves towards the love that we have together let's say in a family then that will be the proper way for the group to exist and it will be a a more a stronger way and a a healthier way for a group to bind together so what we see in the george floyd thing is a weird version of this position where now the victim is elevated and now the victim becomes that which binds people towards a common purpose and is policy making it actually leads policy you know laws were changed budgets were changed things were realigned in the wake of people watching george floyd and george floyd die and so if you don't think that that's a kind of human sacrifice i don't know what to tell you because it worked it i mean it worked in the sense that it created one person dying changed laws all over the united states so you can bicker and tell me that i'm i'm being i'm exaggerating and saying that it's it was it's participating in the pattern of human sacrifice but then why is it changing things why is it actually rebinding society towards different purposes how did it do that if it doesn't if it's not effective if if one person dying doesn't can't change the way society or redirect or rebind or recast society i don't know what to tell you once you also start to see it this way you realize that the modern geopolitical world is based on several sacrifices but two very large human sacrifices and the stability of the modern world is based on two sacrifices one which was the holocaust which even uses language of sacrifice we continue to say the holocaust in and i'm sure that our atheist friends won't dare use in other words be besides holocaust why because you don't get to decide whether or not it works that way and so the the the the holocaust functions as a rebinding of society where living in that in the in the fact of that sacrifice i'm not justif when it's not about justifying it it's about what it does what effect it had and so we constantly remember we remember the holocaust has become part of the narrative which holds the western world together that we did this remembering that we did this that the that the west did this that that that some people were willing to go this far as to kill all these innocents and we we and it it created international law it created all these things that bind us but there's another one too and which is it's of course hiroshima and nagasaki it's a classic example of human sacrifice because the united states calculated they don't know what's going to happen the united states don't know the future they can't completely tell the future but they realize that if we kill these innocent people if we destroy entire cities then we make a bet that it will rebind us together at a higher level that it will stop the war i mean that is exactly what ritualized sacrifice is we we calculate that if we engage in this one ritual act of slaughtering innocents thousands and thousands and tens of thousands of innocents then it will heal us and we will and will rebind our society now i don't i am scandalized by by by both of these but i can i'm not as stupid enough i'm smart enough to realize that it worked that it happened that that it and it participates exactly in the pattern of of human sacrifice that was that would that happen thousands of years ago there's no difference in terms of the pattern there's only a difference if you want to create a weird you know autonomous category called religion but if you don't then you realize that it works and that it happened and so first of all let's look then at abortion what is abortion abortion is exactly the same thing abortion is exactly that someone someone gets pregnant and now they have something that they care about they have a purpose they have something which they think is important and which binds their being towards a purpose and all of a sudden something gets in the way this this this this burgeoning human in them gets in the way and they don't know what the future how could you know the future you don't know what's going to happen but they make a bet and they identify the the fetus they identify the child in their body as the cause of why they're not going to be able to reach their goal they identified as something which is the reason it's the scapegoat it's exactly what a scapegoat sacrifice is they're they're saying it's that thing's fault it's that person's fault and they dehumanize the the fetus like it's that it's [Music] it's the fetus's fault that i'm not going to be able to accomplish my purpose and my goal and so i will sacrifice it to my purpose and once i get rid of that of the reason why i can't reach my purpose then i'm rebound towards the purpose which i had in the first place and so i don't know what to say i mean i don't know what to say besides that it participates in the same pattern it's just it's just a dif it's not re understood as religious it doesn't matter but it nonetheless participates in the same pattern and so let's get to the second part of the tweet that i said that i wouldn't be surprised if elites engage in ritualized human sacrifice now i'm not saying that they do i don't know if they do i'm saying i wouldn't be surprised if they did and why would i not be surprised if they did because i look around me and i see that criminal syndicates use killing as initiation methods they've used it for thousands of years whether it's the spartans or whether it's the hells angels they use killing as initiation mechanisms and and i'm not saying that all the elites function as criminal syndicates but there are certainly some elites that function as criminal syndicates and to the extent that they function as criminal organizations and syndicates and they use the same patterns and structures as as the mob or the mafia or or other criminal syndicates then why would i be surprised that they used that they would use killing as initiation sacrifices i mean i don't know if they do but i wouldn't be surprised if they did because it's a human universal and you see it in civilizations that date thousands of years ago and you see it in the streets of big cities today and so i don't i don't see why that's weird and i it's only weird like i said for someone who creates weird little distinct category called religion a category that they don't understand a category that they can just like uh count off as superstitious and stupid and ridiculous although it's a human universal and it makes them feel safe that they don't have to understand this and then it makes them blind to all these other behaviors that human have that are ritualized and that could be really understood if they took a little bit of time to understand uh to understand what religious what they call religious uh behaviors are and so hopefully this was scandalous enough for you and uh but helpful also to understand that this isn't there's no taboos we're not we're not going to pretend you know we need to understand why humans do certain things and if we can understand it then it will help us also understand the best version of that because i believe the christian story is the best version of that i believe the true sacrifice is self-sacrifice and and i can explain why and i can tell you why and i can see it as the the culmination and the reversal of this whole pattern of sacrifice but if you don't try to understand it and you can't tell me why you think self-sacrifice and you believe it for some amorphous strange reason that nobody understands why it why it is the most important then before you know it you're going to be calling for the death of who knows what scapegoat that you're going to find whether right now we can kind of see it coming up again where you know facebook has allowed us to wish for the death of people of a certain nation and we just do that without realizing that once again and whether whether they are responsible or not responsible you know like i i want i don't certainly don't want to defend what's what they're doing right now but but nonetheless it's still participating in this pattern that we think that we are we are somehow anyways it's good to try to understand what sacrifice is and it was helpful to uh to understand a lot of symbolic behavior so hopefully this has been useful and um and yeah so we'll talk to you very soon as you know the symbolic world is not just a bunch of videos on youtube we are also a podcast which you can find on your uh usual podcast platform but we also have a website with a blog and several very interesting articles by very intelligent people that have been thinking about symbolism on all kinds of subjects we also have a clips channel a facebook group you know there's a whole lot of ways that you can get more involved in the exploration and the discussion of symbolism don't forget that my brother matsuya wrote a book called the language of creation which is a very powerful synthesis of a lot of the ideas that explore and so please go ahead and explore this world you can also participate by you know buying things that i've designed t-shirts with different designs on them and you can also support this podcast and these videos through paypal or through patreon everybody who supports me has access to an extra video a month and there are also all kinds of other goodies and tiers that you can get involved with so everybody thank you again and thank you for your support
