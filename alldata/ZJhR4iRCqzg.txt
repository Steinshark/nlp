ladies and gentlemen the best chess player of the modern generation and arguably of all time is named Magnus Carlson but you knew that already in today's video I'm going to take you through several games that Magnus has played recently here in September of 2023 in the speed Chess Championship which is an annual event 16 players knockout system best players in the world held on chess.com Magnus is taking on top 15 top 5 top 20 grand Masters in this event and he is making it look incredibly easy this is going to be going to be one of those Deep dive videos that I like to do on Magnus showing how he wins in a variety of ways making commentators fall out of their chair making all of us lose our minds and before we jump into the games today I'd like to thank the sponsor of today's Video Copilot folks many of you play chess and it's quite a workout for your brain but did you know many of the world's best chess players are also in great physical shape now taking care of your Fitness is great but the world of Fitness can be pretty confusing weightlifting nutrition supplements group classes cardio martial arts Pilates cycling yoga personal training yeah it's confusing but not for long because you should say hello to co-pilot co-pilot is an affordable Fitness coach app that allows you to have personalized workouts based on your schedule and Equipment it's like having access to a personal fitness coach at all times for a fraction of the price and this is my coach Devin first I met with Devin to discuss my current Fitness level my nutrition and my goals and then he built me a flexible workout plan based on my schedule and the stuff that I had in my house I've got lower back pain and really poor flexibility so we decided to focus on lower body first so Devin prepared this workout I had a lot of stretching I did arm and leg reaches hip thrusts split squats you name it then afterward we had some feedback and we planned the upper body session this works great for me because I no longer have to Google workouts or save tick tocks of hip exercises that I'm never going to do and I can't really be lazy because the workouts are scheduled and Devin will check in with me like hey everything all right we gotta get a move on but I can also tell Devin hey that exercise was too easy next time let's up the weight imagine you had a chess coach that you could check in with at all times you would probably be a world champion pretty soon my friends I highly recommend giving co-pilot a try you can click the link in the description below or use the QR code on the screen to get 14 days free with your own personal trainer now let's get back to the video my friends this is the game that inspired this entire video then I've got a game against Wesley so who is an incredible player actually two games against Wesley so and then I will finish things off with a game against yanyupomishi the World Chess Championship Challenger the last person that Magnus defeated to win the World Championship and guess what he didn't beat me to beat the world to win the World Championship and he didn't beat y'all to beat the world championship so you are undefeated against Magnus and me you are undefeated I I'm not undefeated against Magnus I'm Owen one against Magnus but maybe we'll get that one back one day so Magnus was playing the speech as championship against Vida Gujarati very very strong Indian Grandmaster uh and uh this this game nearly made Daniel laradinsky one of the best commentators in the world very strong and master as well nearly made him leave his seat and not come back so Vida began this game with D4 now you may be like oh this is a bullet game Gotham why are you showing a bullet game and I'd be like don't call me Gotham that's not my legal name um it's one plus one in the speeches Championship they get a second of bonus time so it's a little bit actually more casual uh and Magnus in this game plays a benoni defense uh in the benoni white plays D4 C4 black plays Knight F6 and pawn to C5 and locks the center and basically waits for a little while plays E6 uh and so you will notice that Magnus is actually delaying the move Pawn to E6 this is actually a specialty of Magnus this is kind of called the hesitant The Reluctant the Deferred the delayed benoni uh but at some point black runs out of moves that they can stall with and has to play the move E6 and then we get take take now this is a very imbalanced position there are so many imbalances first of all no E Pawn for black no C Pawn for white so white has two Center pawns black now has the open file to pressure black also has more equity on the queen side with B5 and all of this but then white is going to play A4 the bishop is developed awkwardly these pieces are going to develop to totally imbalance squares rookie 8 played by Magnus Vivid develop defends the pawn in the center and reroutes the Knight to C4 King H1 always a useful move in case you want to move the F Pawn like this Magnus plays B6 preparing slowly to open up over there vidit plays A4 restricting that Rook B8 played to prepare that more Knight C4 played blocking the light squared bishop and immediately Magnus puts the bishop on A6 now if you're gonna trade anything here with white you would think you would trade the light squared Bishop why black has a bunch of Pawns on dark squares over there so you would think black needs the light sword Bishop also you have a bunch of Pawns on light squares already so you don't worry about trading off your light Square Bishop but then Magnus takes on C4 well that seems kind of counter-intuitive why would Magnus trade the bishop for the night now there's dominant control of that side of the board he plays A6 because in chess while we have Concepts that do exist there's things called superseding Concepts and in this particular case the removal of the night for black was very important because then I had exerted tremendous pressure on the position the bishop doesn't in fact the bishop is just going to walk directly into this Pawn so Queen D3 targeting the A6 pawn and preventing B5 Magnus plays Queen C8 sliding out of the pin and now vidit immediately takes advantage of the fact that this Pawn is now weakened in place Bishop before Vegeta is playing a great game he has got Magnus defending now again this is a video showcasing how Magnus wins in different ways offbeat openings Dynamic play right now Magnus is playing defense that's what he's trying to do he's like a good uh you know he he's like a Djokovic down a set or two sets like he was in the US Open he's just defending and vidit has to slowly methodically play forward but now G4 that's a bold move G4 is a is a is a big undertaking he's restricting magnus's Knight and he's preparing potentially in the future some sort of attack but now Magnus plays Queen B7 and now Magnus plays B5 and that's bad uh the game completely shifts after G4 Queen B7 B5 because now Magnus is calling the shots what should vidit have done instead again like I said computer wanted Rook B1 if Queen B7 the computer wanted B4 it needed vidit to play only against magnus's plan vidit got a little bit distracted by this and again Magnus is so good you see things coming that he doesn't even want to play that's how good he is you see things out it's like a fight you know you fight a good fighter that's good with their kids good with their fans good with their different uh looks that they give you and now you're suddenly spooked of something that they have no intention of playing you get smashed on the other side of the board and now Magnus is inching forward as you see the position back to equality look at the time Magnus has not spent any time at all 56 seconds on the clock he has made 22 moves in four seconds he gets a second time a second every time he makes a move but he's averaging like two seconds per move I mean it's unbelievable and now he reels the other night the dark Squad Bishop has opened up now Max is plays C4 restricting the leg sword bishop and restricting the Knight and opening up the queen and opening up the score for the night now the route goes to the open file now suddenly the advantage is completely with white with black but it plays B3 Magnus immediately pushes the pawn 4 the pawns two squares away from queening and defended by that benoni Bishop everything in magnus's position ties together B4 Rook A4 immediately going for the pawn Knight D3 Knight A6 all the pieces are Tangled Up on the queen side it's very difficult to break through Rook C8 Rook C4 oh my goodness look at the pressure but Rook a one just in time take take and suddenly vitted is back in the game maybe with 11 seconds on the clock and now Magnus Carlson in this position Magnus Carlson finds a sacrifice for the ages first Magnus sacrifices the night night takes B4 that is protected by two pieces in the white position what could possibly be the idea the idea is simple it's not a check it's not a capture the Knight used to cover that square now Magnus sacrifices The Rook he gives away The Rook completely why because if you take it it's Chris Cross apple sauce oh my goodness he just loses if he takes the Rook out of nowhere Magnus finds a night sacrifice and an infiltration with the queen and at this point Daniel never did skion commentary said if Magnus in this position finds Knight B4 Queen F2 I will leave the commentary that is Ian that's not human for a bullet game that's not human bullet game you play C2 you try to make Magnus sacrifices the Knight and just bulldozes and I got news for you you know what makes that possible the one mistake that it made number G4 the stop Knight H5 and that that gave Magnus time to do all of this I said G4 was a questionable move right this entire idea of Queen to F2 was made possible because the g-pawn no longer defends it's insane it's an it's literally insane how deep some of his ideas are vidit has to defend himself in comes the bishop The Rook takes back tonight Queen goes to E3 Rook trades and the queen seals off the defense and the game is over the game is over because B1 Queen is coming I mean he just makes it look effortless against these top guys top 20 GM in the world vid it's incredible I mean I mean that was literally vidit made one mistake and it was fatal it was fatal the whole game changed ridiculous I've got another like I said couple of games for you um really unbelievable stuff so this one was this this is this is this is magnesian this is the magnesian school of Chess uh one day Magnus will publish uh autobiography with the best end games that he's ever played and it's going to be a bestseller Magnus I'll write the forward for it being your number one spokesperson I've probably gotten Magnus more publicity than his publicist and manager combined I mean I'm not to take any credit you know I benefit from it too damn my my sweater is sparkly on camera I like the sweater a lot it's very it's very it's very nice I like uh subtle you know bright color I I like uh fashion that's uh not offensive but you know has a little bit of flair to it anyway this is Magnus now obviously this is a five minute game this is a rue Lopez this is a uh a bit more of an aggressive variation by black and now Magnus plays this deferred Pawn to D4 he plays this without actually moving up onto C3 first I think he played this in the World Cup um either against the boss of her or kymer um the position was very imbalanced Queen F3 take take and this is the end game that Magnus gets Rooks Knight and seven pawns versus rook's bishop and seven pawns now who's better here um tough to say by traditional metrics white because white has a better structure black has double pawns double pawns and also two isolated pawns on the edge however black has a bishop which in most end games is better than a knight and black has more open lines because actually having the broken structure gives you certain Dynamic opportunities that your opponent doesn't have there's something in chess called Statics and Dynamics statically just looking at it right now white has a better position just stagnant but dynamically speaking black could play things like F5 which is exactly what he does F5 is losing that double pawn and if you take it the Rook immediately gets in and this is dynamic play look at this there are seven pieces on the second rank The Rook there is a major problem so obviously Magnus doesn't do that uh Rook B1 and we have a trade and this is now the end game black has obviously some split structure black has three Pawn Islands uh and a cluster and what just watch just watch magnus's Pawn is under attack so he plays Pawn to B3 not complicated King G7 improving the positioning of the king Knight G3 rotating the Knight to potentially get to the F5 Square also offering a trade of Rooks black really doesn't want the trade of Rooks because white would get the only open file that is just not something that black should do so the king comes up covers that Magnus now get wait but didn't I just say that he doesn't want to give up the open file yeah but now King F1 you know why because the Knight versus Bishop end game might actually benefit White because black has too many isolated pawns these pawns are very exploitable very exploitable the king and the bishop cannot converge in the center because those pawns are going to be targeted if that pawn ends up on a light Square it's dead it's dead because the bishop can't guard it if this Knight ends up there the bishop could guard it but then the bishop can't move and then the white king could maybe walk over there and just win the pawn so he's hesitant to go into a rook end game all you need against magnus's hesitation that's it that that's the end you hesitate it's over it's like a fight my boxing trainer always tells me the second you start thinking you lost the fight you you lost you have to move now you have to move fluidly Rook E4 the bishop the the bishop gets anchored in with a pawn move Magnus notoriously is so careful with his pawn moves watch how many pawn moves Wesley makes in this end game watch how many pawn moves Magnus makes in the same game Wesley makes a pawn move that's one okay Magnus plays this but I car I hardly count that because that's just a defensive move okay couple of moves later Right Wesley plays another pawn move A5 plays A5 two pawn moves for Wesley a little bit later Wesley makes another three three pawn moves Magnus not touching his pawns if he doesn't have to gives a check forces the king into the middle hits the bishop threatening to Win It The Bishop's Gotta Move now Rook A4 to pressure that isolate upon now G3 and again G3 he doesn't make lightly he wants to kick the bishop out he also doesn't want to lose this Pawn so he wants an aggressive move G3 two but now four four for Wesley and the pawns are moving forward immediately zipping around to the other side targeting those isolated pawns that he helped create the bishop goes back King G2 five pawn moves for Wesley Wesley's idea there was to seal away The Rook over here but this is a massive mistake it's a massive mistake because now the light squares are out for grabs check sliding into H5 Equity has been one on the light scores in the center that is another pawn move that is six pawn moves now six pawn moves for Wesley versus two in this end game Knight T3 he does this that's seven pawn moves now Magnus has to take back so it again doesn't really have eight pawn moves why did he move that because this was targeted there was no other way and it might be the best move in the world but you see what I'm talking about see how Magnus has made progress in this position without even touching his pawns black has come to him and look at the time the time that black spent doing this take Rook A2 Magnus gives a check he defends the pawn and hits The Rook gets in Rook takes D4 he's up two pawns the game is over a couple more moves Knight d8 he's gonna win this Pawn he's gonna get to the bishop he's going to win the spawn black has absolutely no time to save the game and he resigns it is unbelievable how simple Magnus Carlsen makes some of these games look like he plays a he plays an opening he plays a Spanish he gets Wesley out of the comfort zone of a Spanish that he might be used to look at Wesley spending time in the opening Right Wesley is one of the most theoretically well prepared players in the world Wesley spending a lot of time in this open and getting to this position and uh he's thinking on every move so what does Magnus do he doesn't even think does not keep the tension goes straight for the end game because he knows the soul-sucking effect this has on people I'm in an end game versus Magnus I'm in his game right now I am playing his game I'm fighting his fight right and look at the hesitancy look at that 240 on the clock all right black trying to play a little faster trying to speed up a little bit now suddenly 1 55 on the clock right 144 130 120 108 below a minute with 49 and and that is the move you make a big mistake against Magnus you have 49 seconds on the clock to figure out the rest of the game Magnus gets it done um but uh but Magnus also ridiculous you know from the dynamic standpoint of things so in this game Magnus was playing Black um and and this game was not an end game at all this game was uh was not some imbalance the nuanced position and Tech no This was um this game was a murder uh this game Magnus set stepped on the gas and he never looked back and I mean this is what I'm saying his his ability is unbelievable so Wesley begins with B3 Magnus plays E5 so we have a nimso Larson and uh don't be alarmed by the strangeness of this opening it it is very very weird the Knight comes out to A3 to go to C4 don't worry about it if your kids are watching you might want to cover their eyes this is R-rated Knight to E2 Magnus goes for a trade uh we have an ampa song which is great a trade and now the following position now most people here if I asked you like an intermediate or you know you you would say Pawn to D5 and Bishop to F5 and you know something like D5 Castle Bishop F5 and that's not wrong but in chess as you get better you start realizing certain things you don't need to adhere to principles all the time you don't if there's something better play the thing that's slightly better right now and for the next 20 moves of this game Magnus demonstrates initiative initiative in chess is a sequence of moves that simultaneously creates threats against your opponent it also improves your position long term for example the move A6 is just simple because after Bishop takes and pawn takes I mean you can argue that's a threat but right but this is initiative Knight to B4 Knight to B4 threatens to trap the bishop because the bishop now can't take the Knight so if White Castles a6b5 the bishop is trapped so white has to respond if y plays Queen C3 black is going to Anchor in the night and continue to try to trap the bishop so Wesley undevelops his Knight he undevelops his Knight to meet this move with this move Ponto A6 improving the position Pawn to A3 counter-attacking Knight bd5 the bishop is still hanging there's still initiative happening in the position Bishop to C4 now the initiative is over right initiative is over everything that Magnus just did now there's nothing here this is defended or I attempt to develop some more pieces no in this position Magnus finds Knight takes E3 this is on that's one of the weirdest tactics I've ever seen look at how much time Wesley's down 26 seconds the idea of Knight takes A3 is to sack the Knight before the bishop could take it and then trap the bishop in the center of the board but not just trap the bishop in the center of the board trap the bishop in the center of the board in a way where Black's Queen is coming out and this Pawn is weak so if White Castles here you take take and you go to this pawn and white just can't defend it because of that sacrifice so now Queen D4 take take and he Magnus just will not stop making genius moves into Queen D4 right no you take my queen C5 C5 is genius stuff genius stuff if title players watch this they might go oh well C5 is obvious no C5 is brilliant stuff you want him to take your queen so that you can attack his Pawn you don't do it you do this if he takes you you lose this pawn and everything split black white is completely lost so Queen d8 that's hanging the Knight undevelops itself look at this eight seconds on the clock I mean this is what Magnus does to some of the best players in the world and I understand if you got to play three hours of Blitz you're gonna get tilted I get it okay nobody wants to play through can you imagine losing a lot of games in a row and still having to play two more hours you'd break things okay look at this Knight G4 creates a threat and attacks the pawn on E3 the king moves Bishop F5 creates a threat by threatening this and this white goes here to try to get in the way to try to undermine White's control of the D5 Square Magnus and media immediately plays B5 which simultaneously puts pressure on this and removes the control of the D5 Square Knight D5 has played Magnus immediately hits the Knight Pawn to E4 comes in now Magnus takes takes opening up this pin once again now Pawn to F5 stripping the defenses away once again now Knight to F2 F2 hitting the rook in the pawn in the center now Knight takes E4 check cashing in and then he takes Knight C7 Rook to D1 you can take my Rook he gives away a full Rook because if you take it you can't stop my Pawn Bishop F7 nothing can move in the position if Knight to B3 is played I play Pawn to E2 and in this position Wesley so resigned because he ran out of time actually but uh it was just a matter of time his Knight can't get out of the position it's completely stuck E2 is coming and likely Magnus will go on to win the end game actually the computer here gives it the closest evaluation that it's been uh this was a completely unnecessary kind of sequence and this was a nice actually counter Sacrifice by Wesley but it was just too little too late and uh E2 Bishop C4 uh Magnus basically played 15 moves in a row that created a problem night before hit the bishop sacrifice the Knight to hit the bishop threaten the queen to take in the right way created a threat created the threat created an undermining threat created another thread one upon and then was up in exchange and finished off the game instead I mean I got one more for you it would not be a Magnus video if he didn't play a goofy opening against one of the best players in the world in this game in his match against Yankee Magnus played the ayokin alakyn's defense and when threatened he went back this is actually called the Brooklyn variation and it's not as stupid as it looks shockingly the point is overextending like this into a person's position is actually not that good it's not as good as it looks of course it's good but it's not that good in fact if I if I may uh something like uh Pawn to D5 is is equal like look at the eval zero zero zero this position is zero seven two only because white is gonna develop the knights overextending with pawns is not good black will very quickly be able to break these pawns apart you got to be really careful in chess balancing a fine line between overextending and taking space this is good because the pawns defend each other and if one Pawn takes the pawn you can recapture and still have space so Magnus provokes yawn into starting the game up three moves this is the man who played for the World Chess Championship two times already one of the best rapping and Blitz players in the world he's up three moves to start the game okay D6 Knight to F3 pawns C6 that's what Magnus does he plays look he's blocking in his name why because he's seeing how Jan's gonna develop okay he goes like this okay pin I'm pitting him and then I'm gonna develop my knight after developing my Bishop because I can't develop my knight to the center because I need the pawns to actually fight off this invasion he takes e takes now symmetrical structure but white just more active pawns at night castles Knight F6 and Magnus just needs two more moves he's gonna get castle it's very important that he gets castled because he started the game down three moves young plays H3 now the craziest thing about that move is that it loses a bunch of advantage the craziest thing about all of this is that it loses a bunch of Advantage apparently white needed to be faster Jan does it this way which gives Magnus a chance to actually play bishopy what but what about what about the king what about the king um you don't have to rush this move if you play this move Yan is going to go D5 and that's unpleasant because now Magnus has to play C5 maybe Knight E5 instead Magnus says I'm gonna play D5 I have a brick wall and you can't get in young gives a check but I don't understand white wants to Castle a black wants to Castle so why not Queen E2 right Knight f8 Knight f8 you can't stop Knight E6 if you play Bishop G5 or Bishop F4 let's say I play Knight E6 or Knight G6 and and and and then I go here and that's it I have no problems look at the Evo I got no problem I'm better I'm better because your Bishop is so bad your Bishop just stares at a brick wall so does your knight and now I'm gonna go here and there and all this garment trade the bishop and put my knight in F4 put my rook in the eight so Yan by move 12 doesn't even have an advantage doesn't have an advantage despite starting the game up three moves I mean the way Magnus does is unbelievable so what does he do now he trades the bishop like I said take take Knight D7 if Jan could somehow get Pawn to G3 Ponto for he'd be in good shape but the light squares are such a problem for white to break in on Jan mobilizes he gets to F5 not only does he get to F5 Magnus says oh you want to attack me oh no Brea come on in come on in for a cup of tea then Japan to G6 inviting in the night you know why because it's Gotta Go not only does it has to go it has to really go and now here comes Pawn to H5 upside the head where's the Knight going you lost the pawn in the center the Knight was invited in immediately slapped out of the premises and now white is just down a pond so yanjos decides to go all in he's just decided to sacrifice the Knight because if takes there's rookie five so you know what Magnus does this man Magnus Carlsen started this game down three moves and plays King to F6 the Knight on E5 can still be taken it very well might be the best move because the queen is hanging and the Knight is hanging Rook takes E5 this man Magnus puts his King in the center of the board and he's safe you can check him the king is just going to go straight back why because the Knight is hanging you can't give me this check because if you play Queen C3 I'll take the Knight you play Pawn to G4 I'll play King G5 you give me a check I'll play King F6 and then I'll go here and if you check mail block you just don't have enough pieces this man's King is in the center of the board I mean again to the title players this is simple stuff they just very quickly scan there's no shag that works so the king is safe the king of the king is safe in the center of the board rookie one king F6 Safeguard let's trade some pieces Knight E6 by the way Knight takes E6 would have ran directly into Pawn to D4 with pins and stuff so rookie 6 fe6 Magnus blocks his King and Jan resigns Jan resigns uh Jan was just yet another victim of the M Train uh the Magnus Express Magnus starts this game down 3 Tempe and although it is bullet we saw the magic that he can work in bullet against vidit we saw the Magic in this game that he can I mean just so effortless 310p down immediately safeguards his position and just completely effortlessly untangles slaps the Knight around puts his King in the center of the board and uh check and and and white resigns a few moves later it's just unbelievable stuff I mean just at a level uh that that we can only uh aspire to be at uh as uh as individuals I'm really it's uh it's incredible stuff my friends I hope you enjoyed this video uh quick shout out once again uh to today's sponsor uh co-pilot I already said you can get 14 days free uh with a personal trainer uh link is
