hdmi 2.1 has a ton of cool features some of which are so important that they're heavily influencing the buying decisions of both gamers and general users alike but as excited as you may be to run out and buy a bunch of new hdmi 2.1 gadgets there's a major caveat that the manufacturers may not even be telling you about it's similar to how each time there's been a new version of usb lately they've been labeling every new usb product as usb 3.1 and later as usb 3.2 even if it doesn't support the max speeds of the new version pretty dumb but unfortunately hdmi looks like it's falling into the same trap the problem first came to light when a report uncovered a seemingly misleading list of features on a 240hz monitor from xiaomi although the spec sheet clearly stated it was hdmi 2.1 capable it also clearly stated that the maximum resolution of the display was a mere 1080p and the older hdmi 2.0 was already capable of 1080p at 240 frames per second of course just because the device supports hdmi 2.1 obviously doesn't mean it's automatically 10k resolution that's the highest resolution that hdmi 2x1 supports otherwise we'd all be stuck paying thousands of dollars for any display wanted to buy that's not the case but the kicker here was that this display that was 1080p didn't support any any of the new hdmi 2.1 features at all so why was it still labeled as hdmi 2.1 is it just some kind of mistake or xiaomi trying to mess with us actually that spec sheet was completely in order according to the new stupid rules i'm gonna tell you about them right after this message from our sponsor secret lab chairs their engineer to keep you incredibly comfortable for long hours at work and play their new titan evo 2022 chair keeps you feeling comfortable for longer hours with with their 4-way lumbar support ultra comfortable line of different seat material and more all chairs come with a 5-year extended warranty and 49-day return policy so head to the link in the description and check out secret lab today okay it turns out the actual issue here is that hdmi 2.1 licensing requirements now consider all of the old hdmi 2.0 features to be a subset of hdmi 2.1 in other words the name hdmi 2.1 is replacing the name hdmi 2.0 and manufacturers at least for now have cart blanche to slap hdmi 2.1 on their devices even if they're not offering anything new what was the point of the two and but don't worry poor buyer that just wants a nice tv to pair with the xbox you paid scalper level prices for because there's also a requirement that if a product supports any of the new hdmi 2.1 features the manufacturer has to list exactly which ones to reduce certainty and i guess that's better than nothing but again this is the same scheme that usb is using now and nearly every tech observer on the planet has pointed out that this is a dumb way to indicate your product's capabilities and it just muddies the waters instead of making them clearer and even worse if a company wants to actually look out for its customers and just stick with hdmi 2.0 on their spec sheet well guess what manufacturers can't even get their products certified for hdmi 2.0 anymore it has to be under the hdmi 2.1 banner now of course while this might be a surprising bit of news it shouldn't be positively jaw dropping the folks behind the hdmi standard include a lot of hardware manufacturers who obviously want their products to sell well and hdmi 2.1 sounds sexier than hdmi 2.0 especially to those who know about the new features but may not know about the shenanigans going on with the new naming scheme maybe one day the industry will relent on this terrible anti-consumer idea but in the meantime read that spec sheet carefully before plunking down tons of money on a shiny new tv or monitor especially if it says hdmi 2.1 on the box you just found next to the black friday bargain bin so if you like this video guys hit like hit subscribe and hit us up in the comments section with your ideas for topics that we should cover in the future man this one gets my blood boiling
