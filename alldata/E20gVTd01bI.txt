jay mazzini just got an arrest warrant issued by the fbi he's been detained by the fbi and we got new charges related to the bitcoin scam we covered a long time ago we've been going after jay mazzini for three months guys over three months and boys he's done the goose is cooked he's finished we're doing the long intro today because oh boy got a lot to talk about ladies and gentlemen welcome welcome one and all my name is coffeezilla and you're entering the 10 million dollar studio boys home of the internet detective let's go to the let's go to the desk okay oh my gosh i'm sorry if i seem a little excited today you'll have to forgive me it's pretty unusual normally we talk about people and you know they just keep ripping people off but in the case of jaymen z i said since day one that this man's different he's different he's ripping people off so cynically that i knew he was going down i i knew it okay and we've been saying it on this show now for i think my first video on jay was in in december like early december december 10th and it has been a saga it's been like a game of thrones epic adventure multiple videos multiple scams literally we haven't even covered them all at this point i mean have you guys ever heard of habibi life that was another one of his scams there's lawsuits that he's involved in that we haven't even talked about but this man was uh scamming so blatantly so out in the open that today i'm gonna walk you guys through it all culminating in the fbi getting involved again we've talked about how he was arrested that was for kidnapping charges now the fbi have gotten involved for different reasons and uh their charges look eerily similar to a certain somebody's video so we're gonna talk about all of it guys i'm just so happy this is such a vindication to the victims who have stepped forward in all of this you guys don't understand i talk to victims all the time and you know a common thing is like is it worth it do i come forward yes yes yes yes and it this is the best example of why he wants to go out like as cynically as possible ripping off his fan base i was right uh so i said it there over here when we were talking to the bitcoin victim we also had a similar point expressed are you willing to go to court about that oh i would uh i think this is bigger than the court case you're right about that ahmad you definitely were my friend you were right and then again another one of his victims said the exact same thing where do i see this going honestly i'm hoping to god i hope he i hope he rocks in jail everyone has said the same thing which is that this guy is headed for for jail i mean he is doing things that are so unconscionable and um i had to call it out because i was like dude this might take too long we got to protect the victims and so um that's exactly what we set out to do and i'm happy to say that a few days ago or about a week ago jay mazzini was arrested but not for the reasons we had talked about for kidnapping charges now at this point he's just been scamming for so long but again he wasn't charged for that initially he was charged for kidnapping okay he kidnapped a person and we actually interviewed that person um here's a quick thing of his injuries we're going to be talking to him very shortly about exactly what happened but all you need to know is that it all culminated today in this look at this court case the united states of america against jay mazzity first of all that's incredible it's a complaint and arrest warrant um done by the fbi again guys right here fbi have now gotten involved with jay mazzini and actually you can even see in his arrest page it even says that this is the detainer point this previously was not filled out when we first looked at the arrest the federal bureau of investigation hadn't been involved but this is absolute proof this was uh now is included in his first arrest which is for um again kidnapping the fbi has also just taken over the case i mean it seems like they've just like taken over this whole thing and it makes sense because of how bad the situation is so let's go over what he's now been charged with by the fbi now that i give you guys all that context for what's been going on and um can i just say i mean look have we taken a moment to just i mean oh there we go uh congratulations to you guys you guys made all of this possible i mean seriously with you guys raising a big um you know raising hell about this i really do believe that this may not have happened without that um and you can actually see in the charges some familiar people so check this out guys beginning in or around january 2021 the defendant jabara igbar also known as jay mazzini began using his social media accounts to solicit followers to sell him bitcoin we've talked about all of this if you've watched my video i'll leave a playlist of our jamazini scam series you can watch it yourself but here's the important thing one such individual works for a company based outside the united states that held bitcoin and was looking to obtain u.s dollars individual two contacted the defendant also known as jay mazzini igbarra promised that he would wire 195 000 in exchange for 5.049 bitcoin now why does that sound familiar well let's go back in time a little bit and watch our first video on j mazzini's bitcoin scam i sent him 5.0 btc oh how familiar that's exactly the number we talked about in our video in addition it mentions the fact that uh jay mazzini sent the guy a copy of his passport identification page okay now remember what we said in our video he gave he provided with full kyc right so he provides with passport now i know you guys are starting to get the picture here but um i mean let's just go through the full thing shall we please please give me this one okay this is a very special day we've peaked okay honestly honest to god we faked now the next person they mention is somebody who transferred approximately 750 thousand dollars worth of bitcoin to jay mazzini and jay apparently sent this guy a td ameritrade bank account that was uh supposedly holding 3 million dollars in it now again remember what was our second victim that we talked to saying yeah sure let's go ahead and i'll send you an invoice look at that 750 000 that sounds awfully familiar oh my gosh dad guys honestly um i'm just doing this because i'm so proud of the victims who came forward and you know i'm just so proud of each and every person who spoke out against this man and really you guys are the ones who brought this man to justice listen without the brave people who spoke out against jay mazzini there is no arrest there is no bringing this man to justice um so i want to take a second to thank everybody who came on the show was brave enough to put their face on camera and explain the fact that they got scared that's a hard thing to do um and if you've been scammed by jay mazzini you can go to the internet crime complaint center it's called ic3.gov i think that's the best place to submit your um you know complaints at this point it's never too late to submit your complaint whether it's about jay mazzini you've been scammed by something else this is just a great portal to submit your complaints please it really look is this not evidence it really does make a difference let me give you guys the the final part of this whole thing which i find to be hilarious which is that this guy was telling um our our victim that he had look at this three million dollars to transfer to individual number three but in actuality this was a lie and the balance in the account that he was talking about was approximately a hundred and sixty-two dollars jay mazzini claiming to having three million dollars actually had a balance of 162 dollars are you joking this man who scammed so many people he doesn't have any money he's broke you guys have been following a broke loser total loser who is now in jail uh detained by the fbi arrest warrant by the fbi i mean this is just mind-blowing and i lo i love it i mean you guys can probably tell this is like one of the greatest days of my life oh man this is uh it's a blast and i and again you'll just have to forgive me for kind of making this whole thing long-winded because man i am enjoying every second of it this is not gonna happen very often but it's proof again that this stuff does matter oh man it's just mind-blowing so to everyone who submitted their complaint to the fbi recently um thank you thank you for helping make the world a little bit better of a place to everyone who's been scammed don't be afraid to use your voice guys scams are criminally under-reported you guys need to report it when you've been scammed justice is slow but it will come so uh with that being said i guess that's all i really have to say thank you for watching hope you enjoyed this recap and i will see you guys tomorrow ladies and gentlemen
