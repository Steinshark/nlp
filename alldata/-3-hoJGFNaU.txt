600 rejections I want you to feel that for a second 600 rejections and still not able to find a job that's hard that's tough that's that's difficult hey thank you for the five gifted Subs appreciate that the tech industry is kind of a mess right now it's becoming increasingly hard for people to find jobs in Tech and it's particularly hard for any software Engineers trying to get into Tech right now like boot camp grads or recent computer science graduates all of this I do think being a computer science graduate is much easier to find a job and one of the big reasons why it's much easier to find a job is that typically you're going to have a career fair I I I mean for me Career Fairs were widely consequential for me to be able to get what I needed to get and I was very very very happy uh that's how I got my job a lot of people here will talk about the value of a career fair and the big reason why Career Fairs are so nice is that you get a chance to talk to human and you you get a chance to at least interact with one person career aairs have sucked in my opinion I think it's because you're not good at talking to people right like Real Talk career Affairs are amazing you walk up you get to talk to the person you get to tell them how excited you are about this that and the other and like this is your one chance to not be an application in a system but for somebody to take your application right like oh that guy was pretty interesting and then set it down you know what I mean like you actually get a chance to get filtered by not by not job recruiter and not computer system you get filtered by another engineer it's very very good that for me that was one of the best ways for me to get a job was the career fair I thought it was really really good made me think of a time in my life when I was struggling to get a software engineering job where my happiness my direction in life and the speed up and him breathing makes him look like he's having a panic attack it's talking about this direction and everything and look at him Direction Just dude he the man's the man's having a panic attack as we talk okay this isn't actually sped up this is real life normal speed um also this is really bad for your neck okay you know you know I know people that had to go to PT for quite some time because they actually shifted the connection point between their spine and their neck like right here and it like shifted forward and the amount of like PT you have to go through by looking down like that is actually really bad tech neck it's real don't do it like really don't sit like this when you're young it's easy you you can do it but like I hate to tell you this but everyone becomes 30 or you die really young but mostly everybody becomes 30 you should try to embrace the neutral spine you know what I mean you should try to embrace that neutral spine 30 or death your choice your choice and my sense of selfworth were at an alltime low this is the story is pain of finding my first software engineering job my journey through it and my advice to anyone stuck in the same situation okay let's go to get a grasp of the situation we have to get a small glimpse of what I was like in college depending on which version of Kevin you encountered during his college Years you would have found vastly different mindsets dur absolutely right I mean you're going from 18 to 22 if you're like a traditional college person the level of stupid I was at 18 versus 22 is so vast it's impossible to possibly put those two things together hey jety how you doing buddy I hope you're doing well my first year of college I was primarily career focused my main goal was to get a job at Facebook by the time my 4th year had rolled around though guy clearly watched The Social Network he saw whatever that actor's name get backstabbed and he was like hell yeah I'm getting a job at Facebook honestly I guarantee that's probably that's probably what happened and honestly that movie also inspired me to make my first startup in 2008 or 2009 whenever it happened I watched that movie and afterwards I came out so horned up to make my own startup I did a startup it was awesome it was fantastic it actually got me so good at programming because I got not Andrew Garfield the other one the Mark Zuckerberg's character whatever his name is I got so horned up to do a startup that it actually gave me all of the abilities that I got to be able to get a real job and when I went to go to a real job and talk to people man people were so stoked because I actually had some sort of idea of like how to build big software at that point I hyperfixated oh yeah of course I hyperfixated yeah was the one that the shed significantly laziness and procrastination those were the themes of my fourth that is so funny this is like he literally has the exact oppositive story of me I went into college and failed out due to drug usage I went back to college failed due to drug usage and then I went back to college again and then I didn't fail out due to drug usage I actually became a star student you know and I became more and more motivated and as I was able to start doing classes that were like the actual computer side of things it made me so much more excited by the time I was being by the time I was done with school I wanted to be in school more when I first started out it was like all those stupid High School classes I hated high school class classes right college classes are just harder High School classes just the worst but then you actually get into it did you ever go back for master's degree yeah I was uh I was partly into my Master's Degree before I started working at uh Netflix um J gen EDS and college or scam they're they're absolutely I was getting my uh degree in ml I was or really AI like traditional AI because at that point reinforcement learning was just starting to come around and I handworked and built a lot of like models and all that I've shown this a couple times but you know I wear this as both a uh as a badge of honor and as a uh and also as a uh as a badge of shame I wrote an entire nural network in Old JavaScript you can see this this is entire look at that you got that get calculated Sigma radial Bas this function initialized feed forward back propop air hidden uh this is for a certain specific one with an RBF Network because there's not really that kind of stuff we got an Fizz Network adaptive neural fuzzy inference systems you know like I was building all you we were building all the things you know what I mean building all those things look at all that Matrix bonanzas look at that Matrix multiply but why JavaScript because I was just learning JavaScript and so you know I've always carried this mentality which is you do the thing that you're trying to learn about right like for me I always build whatever I'm supposed to build in something that I'm trying to learn and so it's like I did all this in JavaScript because I was just trying to learn JavaScript I didn't know JavaScript I didn't know how any of these things work so I was trying to learn it and so you can see like this is me learning it right I had no idea what I was doing prototype assign like I'm I'm out here assigning prototypes my learning rate learning rate effed me over and over again I'll tell you that much I used you know but you got to remember this was 11 years ago yeah this was 11 years ago when I was getting my masters you know these are old days remember the land of of neural networks has has genuinely changed okay MLPs was the ways to be okay and MLPs you know you're just doing like a little bit of back prop little back propagation of error rate and it's just like pure calculations you know what I mean require cluster yeah there yes there was that wherever that was there was cluster that was a real Library okay that was for doing K means right for or clustering yeah for doing all them sweet clusters uh all right let's get back to that thing anyways I just had the exact opposite experience my attention was all over the place and I didn't take time to plan my postc col life instead I was distracted by other things like socializing or making friends and I act did he just do two groups of socializing and making friends as if those were different yeah socializing or making friends suspicious uh no but anyways like I mean I totally get this because you you you college does give you this this illusion of being very meaningless but by the way WTF no really this is how you get a job is you socialize and make friends you just got to make friends in your group I think there's this thing that happens to a lot of people where they go into programming and they're not dorks does that make sense they're like they're not dorks they're not people that are like really into computers and so then they're around other people that are dorks and they're like ew I want to go make real friends right and then they go off and they make they they don't even realize like you just make friends with the people that are interested in the same things as you and it actually makes first off you get friends for life but two you actually create like great networks where you guys can help each other get jobs I think it's crazy like you know you should make friends with people who are like who just are around you trying to go out of your way to be like oh these guys are stupid while you're that person also it's it's not going to help I don't think he did this I don't know if he did this I'm not saying he did this I'm just saying I've seen this happen I watched it happen I watched quite a few friends started off as really great students and then they quit being our friends and been other people's friends and their grades were all suffering and they're trying to be like too cool but you're getting a computer science degree dog you're dork you literally you're like Bill Gates jumping over a chair okay you're not awesome that's it's okay and it's okay not to be a dork like socializing is how we got funding for your projects it really is like that's okay be Bill Gates jumping over the chair and just just like just own it man no the thing is is that the thing that's worse is people who try to pretend like they're not that right going there armpits sweating yelling something yelling something about like developers and just being okay with it like that's 10 times better than the person that's really trying not to be that person right you're drinking your coffee before it was cool you're hipster out of your mind right get out of here I heard a great oh I can't tell you the joke never mind I can't tell you the joke I can't tell you the joke until the 21st I'll tell you the joke then actively put off thinking about the future until it was too late I didn't have any real software internship experience I didn't know any web Frameworks I didn't know how to interview for software companies by the way that's a huge mistake if you're in college like that's the goal of your junior year your sole goal of your junior year is not to get the best grades your sole goal is not to be the most social your sole goal is to find that effing career fair talk to every last person you know and you try to get that internship for three 3 months and if you can't get an internship for 3 months at some company go to your school try to do an internship for one of the grad programs because there's they're always looking for people to build software for some sort of research project there's like so many ways you can go about doing that but you got to go like you got to go hard and you got to find that because that's going to make such a big difference in your life this is not so so I I I hate this honestly I hate this I guarantee you he was told 900 times to do these things there wasn't a class that didn't go by my junior year where teachers weren't saying do these things it's not school that fails people it's it's people that fail people like 90% of the time like you're right there's some institutions that aren't good but my guess is if you're at UCLA you probably have really good teachers that are there trying to tell you how like how to do things yeah he just told us he failed himself yeah I feel bad for the guy CU you know what so many people do this so many people do this school is extremely outdated though you know what I actually disagree with this take generally the reason why I disagree with that take generally is that every single person that's coming out of a boot camp is immediately useful they come out they have all the skills to pay the bills you know why because they know react they know Tailwind they're on Facebook theyve built the mongod DB right they've done it all I get it they're immediately useful but they have no direction and no Foundation other than just building like these apps that are just immediately practical so they have a lot harder thing to learn they they have to literally go outside of work and learn extremely boring awful topics like compilers like compilers is fun but it's also really awful like it's a hard it's arduous once you get Beyond any sort of amount like you really have to be committed you have to go out there and learn what operating systems it's hard you really have to think about these things oh you want to learn like computer languages again you have to go out there and really like read about how these things work it's difficult okay and so to grow as a post boot camp grad is really really really hard I'm not saying it's impossible it's just really really hard a software engineer coming out a CS student sure you're absolutely right they're coming out the gates not nearly as useful but you know what they do have they have data structures down they can tell you exactly why the HTML is the way the shape it is and why General trees make sense and how to walk General trees and how to do all those things right they get it they get the time space trade-offs that are happening okay oh they understand JavaScript why is it operating The Way It Is Well I've done a compilers class I can tell you why this is not so efficient I can tell you why these things happen sure they're not as efficient but they can tell you a lot more about the system of course they can tell you about a general tree of course they can tell you about compilers of course they can tell you about these things they just don't know how to practically apply them one year on the job and they've applied a lot more knowledge and it's easy to catch up like this is not hard to be this is not hard to do this is why you can come out in 6 months this is hard to do this is why it takes many years I'm not saying it's great I'm not saying it's perfect I think they should teach some more practical like there it'd be great to have industry standard experience classes absolutely fantastic it just makes it a lot easier to grow because you have Foundation whereas I think these people come across without all that Foundation it makes it a lot harder to grow like this Gap is huge this Gap is hard you know what I mean a dude a CS student that went through a boot camp is going to come out pretty animal like they're going to they're going to be ready to kick some ass they're going to come out pretty op because they have all of that Foundation plus like here's a bunch of Modern Standard things that you know startups are looking for what about boot camp grads going to college uh honestly I worry much more about boot camp grads going to uh College just because the first couple years are going to be really boring definitely try to test out out and challenge courses like you don't want to skip data structures you don't want to skip discret math or Advanced data structures or any of those things but you also have like a bunch of you know what I mean you also have a bunch of steps that you need to take that I think is going to be really difficult that that you're just going to find extremely boring right as a boot camp gr I 100% agree here that's why I've worked super hard to fill the gaps yeah I think you just have to work harder because I was stupid and someone just told me what to study and I passed a class right it means I just accidentally got lucky it doesn't mean that you know the schools fails them uh in that they aren't getting practical experience they used to no no actually that that is that is absurdly incorrect college has always been for the rich person to be to learn how to Leisure well it's only recently changed so no school is not failing people school has become more practical than it's ever been I personally think like a good 2-year boot camp is like where things should be like if you could have a good 2-year boot camp camp that really like Hound like really hounds the data structures pushes a good compiler course that really makes people learn a you know you know like learn Linux well like and makes them actually like useful like trade school I actually think computer science should be more of a trade school than it is uh a a university thing I think a trade school would be a lot lot a lot a lot a lot a lot a lot better uh I don't want to start a two-year boot camp honestly uh the problem I have with that is that I mean I do want to start those kind of things of course I do I think it'd be great and I think I could be very successful at it but I also think that it's really really difficult uh it would be very very hard to do it successfully and I'd want to do it the best as possible and to do it the best as possible it would just be it would be like a life's work right I'd have to take like a year and a half off just to focus on like how we need to set this thing it just take a long long time to get it done well and I wanted to be able to do it well you know what I mean you need a team of people it'd be very hard two years sounds good I think that's how long it takes to do a CS without all the boring yeah exactly that's why I'm saying like you could do the Practical mix like I would want someone coming out of my boot camp to have built some sort of redus like clone to have built HTTP to have built git that understands like these basic things that have built servers that have done stuff right but that also understands compilers that have built their own DSL that has executed it because here's the thing if you have built your own DSL and your own compiler when you're at work and someone says we should make a DSL for this you can say first off slow down you don't know anything about compilers let's take a step back okay do we really want a DSL I've made a DSL and I can tell you right away that they're extremely difficult they're hard to maintain and they can be emotionally painful so maybe we should really think about this decision before we do it and if we do do it I have the experience at least to do something with it I suggest if we truly need something let's consider some sort of alternative such as Apple's new configuration language Lua and anything dsls are probably not the way to do it just thrown that out there what is a a DSL a domain specific language like dsls are great I get it dsls can solve problems uniquely but it can also be a huge pain in the ass an example of a DSL is the following I can go like this uh I can go set you know uh what is it what is it something inside here right so I can set something in here this is actually a DSL set is a keyword that sets a property in Vim for you to do something it also has the exact same thing you can also do all those things via uh Lua now Lua is really really nice Lua is a language I can look up how to use Lua has lots of documentation Lua has been well supported vimscript well you better hope that you can find your problem you better hope that you're not experiencing some weird Edge case you better hope that it's not poorly thought through right like that's the problem about dsls and Vin script is going to be a much better DSL than anything you write I just want you to know that in Vim script is horrible and it's better than anything you will create vimscript it's zero and one indexed why because you programmer I don't know that's why all right let's keep on going sorry that was a long tangent and I hadn't studied a single question of lead code or cracking the coding interview this lack of foresight by the way that is um that's one thing that's really good about college because you should have gotten a really intense data structure classes doing good at data structure classes you will always be able to do most lead code questions just off the rip because you can most lead code questions most cracking the coding interview questions are just things you studied in college they're just like you know they're just that and so the only thing that I think really is good about lead code questions by the way is going to be DP questions which you don't typically study in college or you do very little uh and two you using arrays to solve problems often you're not using like arrays to store a graph uh you know you most people use like an adjacency list they don't lean into the adjacency Matrix and sometimes it's really really difficult to use a bunch of arrays like cityscape is just an exercise in how well you understand arrays not really anything else and so you know that's one of those like leak code nice things is that when you get onto a whiteboard you're just like oh yeah I can do arrays really easily i' like I've used them a whole bunch I'm pretty good at this stuff you know what I mean it all came back to haunt me on the day graduation several times for most people graduation is a moment of Triumph it's like the cination of years of hard work and I felt very sad graduating I felt like as I you know when a Frodo comes back to the Shire it's just not home anymore it's an end of an era it's an end of an era and I I felt really I felt really sad about that you know what I mean cuz I knew it was over yeah if you get a paper you don't get a job and so for me that was like hard you know it was really it was really it was really hard CU I knew that I I'm CH there I don't know what the next era is but it is the next era and that was hard that was a hard moment for me moving on to the next stage of your life but for me that day was the saddest moment I had experienced up until that point in my life looking back I realized that so I do have to say one last thing the the fact that saran was Sharky I I still to this day I can't believe there's a bad guy named shy and Lord of the Rings I just felt like that was kind of weird okay that's all I'm saying that's all I'm going to say about that we're moving on I had barely changed since the first day I walked onto campus my my work ethic was still terrible my social skills were terrible and I hadn't achieved the goals that I set out to achieve and worst of all I was not ready for this next phase in my life and I knew that I was about to be forced into a deep dark time before anything got better for me personally or professionally I moved I do think a lot of I mean I do think our society in general at least Western Society does encourage more adolescence longer and I do think a lot of these a lot of these issues are extended adolescence issues um you know I I I I I had the greatest Misfortune and the greatest Fortune to be able to grow up fast and I do think that that helps is having some of that growing up fast because you know you skip 10 years of dinking around till you realize what you really want to do and I I I do think that that helps a lot again I I attribute a lot of it to being in the right place at the right time you know but self-drive and discipline is incredibly important absolutely home from college about 3 months after graduation and at the time I had not even begun to understand the weight of the position that I was in I had yeah no job prospects lined up and even worse I hadn't even made an effort to secure one my resume unimpressive to say the least but I remember hearing about the intense demand for software engineers at that time and all the years previously I one in the chat if you're kind of in this guy's shoes I'm actually just curious one in the chat if you're in this guy shoes damn y'all well you're currently a student so learn from this mistake right Twitter's dead Twitter died picked myself into believing that my computer science degree alone would be enough to land me a job I mean I spent four years in college right surely that was enough to secure my future a piece of wisdom I've learned in the past few years there are only two ways people change people either change after deep self-reflection and self-improvement or they are forced to change by circumstance and this circumstance was about to hit my life very very soon at the time Bas take base take you know the number the point one on his take is wisdom right the ability to make those self-reflection those the ability to make change before disaster happens is really like that that is the mark of a a wise person I unfortunately have rarely been a wise person I've had a few moments in my life where I have done number one but for the vast majority I've done number two unfortunately I'm that guy I learn best by uh getting into horrible situations you're still wise if you can learn from a mistake if you can learn from your mistake you're still wise you're wisest if you can learn from others mistakes you're wise if you can learn from your own mistakes you're a fool if you keep making them I looked around at my friends and classmates and saw them getting jobs at top tech companies and I thought that I could do the same I wanted to work for a unicorn startup because in my head that's where I belonged and it couldn't be that hard to get in could it but as I started applying to jobs I realized just how misguided I really was I submitted like by the way he also has that UCLA like hopefully that really puts things into perspective I had Montana State University okay I I I do I do want to throw something out there when people think of prestigious schools oh yeah UC Irvine okay whatever he had a school that people think tends to be a little bit more impressive than Montana State University just to be real there okay no one thinks Montana State University is going to be uh Montana Ain't Even Montana's not even a state that exists okay there's California California Texas and New York City like that's the three states in America and credentialism did not help him here so like that is really something you should uh you should really think about Montana mentioned let's go like you should really think about that that credentialism is not going to help you I even think the day of graduating from you know MIT and these top schools I think that that in itself is also falling apart I think that that that it doesn't get you anywhere anymore right credentialism is gone and so you should really you got to you know we are more towards a meritocracy in some sense because we're dropping that so 10 applications my first week to compan I'm not saying by the way I'm not actually saying that's good or bad I think there is something that's good about credentialism because we should have a place we can look to to say people that come out of this are really really good and if that's falling apart there's something kind of sad about tradition and that kind of stuff right there is something sad about that and I I do mean that that that is that is there there is a sad part to it it's not 100% whenever someone says no that's 100% bad I'm like not all things are 100% bad there's always there's there's sometimes a good part to that I'm not saying it's great as a again as an average Montana nroy enjoyer I did not get to enjoy a drop of credentialism you know what I mean Snapchat Pinterest Yelp thinking that they were easy targets while I worked o Yelp Yelp might just be the single worst tech company okay like I I mean I under I I understand there's some really shady tech companies out there but Yelp just might be like top three most evil companies like dude the extortion that they do on on small businesses is crazy okay it's crazy they extort companies like they genuinely do oh Yelp is like a um Yelp is like a a like a local rating service right you know how when you go and you search up a restaurant and it's like this restaurant has 3.5 Stars that's either like Google ratings or Yelp ratings and Yelp is a uh it's pretty bad Better Business Barrel also like anytime like the thing is is anytime you find a rent Seeker you also have found something that's likely hyper corrupt anything that sits in between two things often can be quite corrupt worked my way up to big companies and then like yeah same so I applied a few more jobs that I thought were in my skill level like Dropbox Groupon into it but remember Groupon the results were the same nothing for someone so naive so deluded and so used to getting what I wanted this came as a surprise my degree was not enough to get me hired I even remember this one instance 2 months after moving back home I managed to secure an interview with a company in Southern California and the whole time going through the interview process and the recruiter screens I thought getting the job would be easy I didn't spend any time preparing for this interview and instead I focused on learning how to negotiate my salary and as you can I mean at least he's coming in with confidence you know like one thing can be said in life being confident is a good thing you know what I mean hey yo yo yo I I do I do want to say I do want to say like I'm not here to knock on this guy this guy is like a bunch of kids this guy represents an entire class of people right I don't I I'm not here to dunk on him I think this is fantastic right like dude I thought you could just drop LSD and smoke a little bit of meth and and also have a great family life at some point okay I'm not saying I'm not Mr I'm not Mr outstanding okay I I I it took me a while to get here okay I was just as deluded as this guy just happened to be a different set of delution you can't you really can't like you genuinely can't do those things it it could I mean genuinely you could be right it could be it's one of the it's one of the things that I think about all the time which is uh kids growing up in a situation in which they have money right sometimes it can delude them to think that life just comes easily right but this is great I actually I really like this story expect I didn't get the job and in fact I wasn't n even close I remember hanging out and talking with my friends afterwards grabbing a beer I was talking about my interview downplaying the situation talking about how I didn't want to work there anyway and as I wrapped up my story by the way the didn't even matter bro that is literally the the sorry bro for the person dude it's cope it's pure copium it's beautiful my friends just quietly acknowledged it changed topics and then we moved on I couldn't really understand at the time why my friends were so quiet in response to my story but now I can see how clueless and delusional I was and just how badly I struggled with self-awareness and humility I see now by the way uh I would I would just throw it out there not necessarily good friends you know like a good friend will be honest with you yeah rotating p you literally right right as I'm saying a good friend will like you know like a good friend won't do it in front of people a good friend the next day will talk to you right like if you're in a group of people you should never call out somebody unless if it's like that egregious um but generally a good one-on-one conversation if you actually think someone's being diluted like a good friend will take the time to be like yo dog like this is this ain't this ain't this ain't good you know what I mean this ain't good okay Benjamin [Laughter] Franklin okay Aristotle with your friendship definitions Mr Aristotelian guy over here now how I came off to them here was this kid who hadn't paid his dues in life he didn't have a job he hadn't worked hard or accomplished anything of note and he had a right to complain about job prospects no one was going to tell me how misguided my thinking was it was up to me to Fig by the way someone should have again good friends would tell you that you're goofing up okay I mean for me in fact that statement right there is actually more of a condemnation of the people he was surrounded with and himself right you're equally diluted if you think friendship is just about having good times like that's no real friend it just isn't that's not a real friend that's a Chum that's that's a bud right that's not it's not that's not that's not real Facebook friends act this way exactly you're a Facebook friend in real life figure it out on my own in the next few months my job search became increasingly difficult I was not aware that most companies tend to slow down their hiring process at the end of October in preparation for the holiday season this was that caught me completely off guard and the true welcome to the real war I mean that does happen it's very very true typically you don't want to change a lot right before the holiday season new pressure of the situation began to set in it had been nearly 5 months since I graduated college and I wasn't even close to getting a job I found myself submitting dozens of job applications per day I wonder if he was building things I he hasn't addressed it I don't think he's talking about the low I wonder if he was like building things like how was he preparing or what was he doing to change I hope that he covers that CU that's like my big thing I keep thinking about was what was the moment while going through online forums Reddit or just any someone is asking curious about real friends dude just go Arista tilian on it right you got to have location proximity of things you enjoy and ability like an ability to have tough conversations right it's pretty simple like it's really hard to be longdistance friends it just is it's just simply like if you don't live near each other if you can't see each other it just it it does become harder if you don't have shared interest it becomes even harder it just does like that's like just like I mean dude some dude 2,000 years ago with a beard and and marble statue said that he's probably he's probably right good friends aren't common anything to look for advice on how to get a job I was told to Elite code to learn web Frameworks to build side projects to network with other people for referrals and I just began to get completely overwhelmed by the number of things I needed to do to get a software job and I realized there were people out there preat that studed 10 times harder for 10 times longer and still were unable to get a job and despite this I mean I say this all the time which is like if you're not willing to go really deep and really hard w like just remember there's always someone that's willing to work harder than you now you don't have to be the hardest worker you don't have to be the most aggressive learner but there's always somebody that is willing to go harder than you that their life circumstance is more desperate than yours and Desperation will make people work much harder but you just got to understand that when going into it which means that you have to be willing to put in some hours I 100% couldn't be the engineer I am today without the countless weeks of 80 hours I'm not saying it's great I'm not saying it's perfect I'm not saying it's the way life should be but there's also a reality to the situation me submitting hundreds of applications I received very few responses in the month of December I was able to secure two on-site interviews with startup companies in San Francisco in one of the interviews the interviewer ended my technical screen early probably because of my performance and as someone who's given many interviews many many interviews including many at Netflix hundreds at my previous job you just got to understand when someone says hey you know I'm not too sure about this why are you using that or some phrase like that right what they're saying to you is hey man you aren't doing this right let's take a step back let's try to think of a new way to approach the problem current way skill issues okay you're skill issuing hard right now and I'm giving you like a little Waring a little red flag that your skill issuing let's walk back a little bit instead opted into having a friendly conversation with me he asked me the question so what did you do in school I knew what he was asking me failing interviews it was painful but that was nothing compared to seeing the disappointment in my parents' eyes I couldn't help but think of the sacrifices they made to immigrate to this country working hard to attend school here Asian moment people talk about yeah people talk I've heard many people talk about this you know that's one thing that I I love about my mom she was so proud of me that I just that I I wasn't using drugs right like that was like she was so happy you know there there's something magical about having a parent that just loves you you know even even when you're still a disappointment they still love you you know what I'm talking about there's something very very nice about that to find a job here and to leave everything behind to make a better life for the their children and as I struggled to find a job as I submitted 600 job applications to almost every company I could find in the state of California I couldn't help but feel like I was letting them down and at the same time letting myself down people don't change unless they go through a heavy amount of self-reflection or they are forced to by circumstance ironically this whole situation about me not being able to find a job it was jarringly similar to an experience I had just 4 years previously instead of a job search I was in high school and I was trying to get into top colleges I had spent most of my high school years procrastinating neglecting my grades I typically like to brag that I did one day of homework in all of high school I got a 2.16 not a big deal not a big deal NBD there's reasons why I may have gone to Montana State University just throwing that out there I had a mediocre at best college application and yet I thought I had a chance to apply and get into top colleges because that's what my friends were doing and when the time came to receive College acceptances I found myself rejected by almost every school I applied to I remember one of my SAT tutors sat me down and told me to never put myself in a situation where I wasn't preparing for the future ever again and while some of that message might have stuck with me for a bit obviously none of it stuck long term people don't change unless they are forced to change there's so you know it's funny that he remembers that statement isn't it funny how sometimes you'll have those moments with somebody where they say something to you and you know it's good advice but it like there's this old adage that says the greatest distance in the universe is the distance between your head and your heart and sometimes it's true you know sometimes it takes you know like sometimes you can hear the exact thing you need and it's just so long before it actually makes it to the right spot it's crazy is that a phrase from Romeo and Juliet maybe I can't remember where I heard it but it is it is it is actually it's an extremely good phrase you know what I mean it's an extremely good phrase because I know besides for the people that are like witch head like I know you guys are meing but I'm just trying to be real here for a second twitch chat can you get your can you get your your ass off the top of your head anyways I would like to tell you after this point how I completely transformed how I studied like 18 web Frameworks until I became the perfect candidate but none of that happened truly what happened came down to numbers and luck applying for jobs it will always be a number game this by the way this this ending and the morale the morale of the story part of it is a little disappointing just throwing it out there like I was really hoping the change was that like you know he really embraced the suck he really crushed it as he continued to apply when it says just like gosh you got lucky was no honest though it's honest though I had spend months trying to create side projects to put on my resume trying to learn react trying to read through cracking the coding interview and finally in January of 2017 I received a call from a tiny five person startup located in San Diego I was Lu enough to be asked technical questions in fields that I had prepped pretty well in the last few months and even luckier nothing's better when you get asked a direct question word for word out of cracking the coding interview so let's just pretend you had a singly linked list and you wanted to find a cycle in it and you're just like oh really I've never heard heard this tell me about it well if I were a thinken man which clearly maybe I am I would assume that you'd probably want like it's almost like I could Envision like a tortoise and a hair and like one thing being able to speed fast while something else goes slow and at some point if there is a cycle it's going to intersect gosh dang I am smart never even heard of this question before in fact I'm not even sure what a tortoise or a hair is I just know they exist and I manifested this wisdom in the interview this company was looking for a very specific profile of software engineer someone who was a new college grad someone who could code and figure out problems and someone who was willing to take a low salary and so this was my I took a low salary so far removed from my original delusions of working for Facebook or some startup unicorn but after the months of failure nothing was Sweeter Than This sense of success I had in the Moment by the way this is a great reminder that the pull yourself up by the bootstraps though obviously everyone's going be toic yeah okay shut up there is something also really amazing about accomplishing something yourself being able to like get out there and do it and persist and get that W and know that you're the one that is trying to really push for that W there is something about that that's really good like it really has made me feel like those are some of the things that makes me feel very good you know what I mean sometimes I think of the scenario of if I didn't get that job offer I wonder how long I would have been searching before I finally found one a couple more months 6 months a year a couple years would I have just given up it's difficult to tell but it was definitely one of the first lessons in my life about how incremental progress every day helps you to reach your goal if I wasn't studying leak code learning web Frameworks applying to jobs little by little every day even this random Stroke of Luck it wouldn't have panned out if you found again it's not because it's luck it's opportunity okay that's hard work meets an opening and you're already ready for it okay I don't I it's hard for me to call it you know like I understand that there's luck involved the fact that you saw but luck is not always just luck you know what I mean luck is when preparation meets opportunity exactly it's just like you see these things and it's just like I love this part this last part right where it's just like the perceived value of Daily Grind isn't really there but what really is happening is you're growing up and you're actually getting better faster and like so much of this is just all that hard work coming together it's beautiful found my story relatable in any capacity you need to be the reason to make a change for yourself in life at a certain point no one will push you no one will say anything to you no one will force you to do anything you will have to do it yourself willingly or be forced to by painful circumstance that's a thumbs up oh I must have already watched a video by him great video by the way created by Casey that was a great video anyways the name you know what the name is okay hey guess what what the name is the world's hard and I absolutely love that we have the ability that we have and you know what software engineering has been one of the greatest distributions of skills and pay to people you know the fact that I can be just some small Montan kid and be able to go work at Netflix I think is absolutely fantastic I love the fact that people who have no ability like no Legacy no Rich parents no super also awesome amazing everything upbringing all those things that they can actually make a real imp act in an industry and get to be paid well at least in America like that is pretty freaking awesome right that is like that that that is incredible the fact that we even have that as a potential opportunity is is incredible and so I absolutely am 100% very thankful for the fact that I got uh to be able to go in software engineering I got to be able to try to make things that I want to make I want to be able to do what we're doing now like that's a huge privilege and I'm very very happy about that cuz you know what 97% of the world used to be Farmers there was one thing you you would do and that was what your dad did which was farming and if you just happen to be one of those extremely lucky few percentage that didn't have to do that you probably died cuz someone stabbed you or raped you then stabbed you or raped your wife and then stabbed you and also killed your kids cuz that was like most the world average age like 32 or some crap and it was absolutely horrible and everybody kept stabbing each other like oh man man you looked at me sideways I stabbed you that's why butter knives exist because they used to use just regular knives and people kept stabbing each other at the dinner table okay we had to round our effing knives to quit killing each other okay was wild back then and to pretend like somehow we live in a horrible day and age is crazy okay I haven't tried to stab a single person while eating a meal with them I live in a golden age of humanity I don't die from accidentally cut myself on a little rusty nail get tetanus and die a you just got bit by that thing you're dead oh you just got cut by some metal you're dead oh you played in the dirt and you had an open wound and you ACD got tetanus from the ground which does happen you're dead oh my goodness Raiders happened you're dead oh brigand you're dead oh you're walking on the street cuz you wanted to go visit your neighbor neighbor five miles away and there was a thief you're dead like oh my goodness like how crazy were those times a Jen
