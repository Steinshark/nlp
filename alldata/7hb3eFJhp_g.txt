ladies and gentlemen welcome back it's the world rapid and Blitz chess championships here at the end of 2023 two of the three most recognized titles in chess are up for grabs this is day number two I will recap many many games for you many fun moments Magnus Carlson swearing and yelling at himself at the board for example some amazing Comba of Chess and as always drama on day one of the world rapid Championship yesterday Yan pishi put out a tweet essentially saying that Magnus Carlson has access to a private personal Lounge in between the rounds and access to a laptop that was then widely discussed on social media both Magnus and his father said like he doesn't have an access to a laptop this year in the past they were all allowed to have access now apparently they're not anyway that was like day one today on day two shoes are the main point of the drama shoes because today this happened aniah Kazarian uh who is a Dutch streamer she's rated like 2200 Fay as well you take a look at this was was found to be violating the dress code of the tournament at the bottom you see her shoes now from here they might look like Converse sneakers but they're actually Burberry dressy sneaker type shoes now the dress code at the international governing body let me pause there uh she was told to changed them and then was given a fine she was given an official warning and a fine and if you read the bottom it says continuing infringements will be removal from the tournament okay that's crazy um there are dress codes at these types of events because they want to you know give the impression that chess is like a very sophisticated elegant game um but a bunch of the top players are in hoodies they're in like t-shirts underneath their Sports coats it the whole thing is so ridiculous I mean it's not like people are playing shirtless at these events these are shoes Anaya's outfit was a full dress she was in a full dress like a like a like a evening like a like a dinner dress and she was wearing Burberry shoes and they they're finding her A1 Euro I mean the whole thing is and then they put out this tweet this was really funny players can unwind in the lounge area between rounds and the World Championships I don't know if this was the social media director being a genius but if you that's Yan pishi on the left Yan pishi is sitting with a phone in his hand headphones on his head those shoes are also sneakers like they're dressier sneakers the whole thing is just so absurd I really hope they were send the fine uh I mean I I don't even I I don't even understand why these events have these um dress codes because nobody is like violating them egregiously we just I don't know what I don't even I I'm speechless at the decision- making of the international governing body of the game I really I just am I am and yeah anyway Magnus Carlson versus vid gudi will kick us off today uh vidit with a four and a half out of five performance on day number one he opens up with D4 we have Knight F6 as always we're going to cover some very very big games we're going to look at Prodigy watch we're going to have we're going to check in with uh some games from the um from the from the Women's Championship as well and then we will end with a uh with with a game where Magnus Carlson was cursing at himself at the chessboard so beautiful stuff all right vidit plays the Catalan because it's his bread and butter it is the opening that he plays it's his Roy and what goes what goes well with I don't know but the Indians uh in in the uh in the I was just about to say in the chat I'm not live streaming in the comments will will educate me like what is the pairing you eat Roy with maybe you don't eat Roy with anything I'm an American okay like here we have butter chicken and chicken chicken tick Masala like that's what we Bishop D2 takes takes Bishop G2 Magnus plays a very solid line plays very solidly look at this very solid play by Magnus just develops all his pieces vidit puts his Rooks Magnus brings his rook and now vidit plays this move Queen F4 okay so what now white has a slight space Advantage uh we have tension here nobody wants to take black doesn't want to give his opponent two Center pawns for no reason um white maybe wants to go for E4 definitely will'll consider H4 as well will potentially consider samide attack Magnus plays Bishop A6 the Magnus targets vid's Pawn now vidit does take vidit takes because the bishop doesn't have a Target anymore Pawn takes D5 now potentially opening up the same side C file also the same side uh capture means that this Knight is offside like the Knight would potentially be better on that square but of course the Knight will maybe reroute position is still very much in the balance and and now vi just goes to attack Magnus vi just goes for an attack plays G5 and then he plays H4 so vid is is not he he is not showing any signs of being nervous or afraid he plays G5 H4 Magnus will likely try to reroute the Knight to the F5 square but not too fast because of course there is H5 and um vid's going to try to take advantage of the weak and dark squares all right Bishop H3 he's protecting the knight from coming to the F5 Square Rook C7 and now and now Magnus is double up on the C file now vidit decides I want to trade the knights Magnus says I'd like to keep the tension vidit trades and says no I I really did I say Knights I'd like to trade the knights did I did I say I meant the Rooks the Rooks too much dress code conversation and you see vidit here should have fully Justified the play vidit should have played Queen C3 that's what vidit should have done but instead of that he played Queen A3 Magnus plays Bishop E2 attacking his Knight vidit defends it and what ends up happening now is we trade and we have a totally symmetrical position we have all the same pawns both sides don't have a c pawn and this is something that vidit probably wanted to avoid because now he is in this position against the best endgame player probably of all time who's going to try to take advantage of the smallest of imbalances now there is a universe in which the Queens had been traded a long time ago and this is probably just the draw but now Magnus is going to try to keep pawns on and vid's going to start getting lower and lower on time we have Knight F6 now vid down to below 3 minutes Magnus grabs the pawn he's going to work that magnesian magic all right Knight E5 he's going to work some of that that some of that Norwegian uh Juju stuff he's got going on look A5 it's just Knights it's just Knights vidit defending his Pawn Magnus plays Knight E4 all right now he's going to start dancing with the horses all right Magnus has a two-minute time Advantage he's trying to go to a single night end game it's a it's a completely equal position though V minute on the the clock goes for some trades wants to trade off pawns Knight D3 now Magnus transfers the knights F6 Knight E4 Here Comes magnus's King all right now we're whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa the pawn the pawn that vided put out there like 30 moves ago when he was attacking Magnus all this G4 in the long run these pawns are potentially going to be weaknesses and that was move 18 and now we fast forward to move 54 36 moves later and the pawn has fallen and Magnus is still up upon it's maybe drawable with best play vid tries to fight in the center but Magnus just brings the king and it's when you play Magnus in an end game it's like getting caught in a Whirlpool I mean it's just a matter of time and the pawns are too far apart they're just too far apart you're not going to be able to stop them you can go for this Pawn but I'm going to make a queen and uh Magnus gets the job done tough game for vidit because he actually was really keeping close with Magnus there for a while but um he he's just he's just really really really really good at end games I mean that's just um that's just the truth I mean what what can I say um now arjin Ari Vladimir FV arigi needs to win the event that is the pressure on Ari's shoulders we have a Spanish we have a Berlin we have no Berlin nope D3 played by Ari by the way their ratings are different Ari is actually like 2720 but their ratings are different because these are rapid ratings Bishop D6 H okay Bishop A4 very interesting position C3 Rook E8 now f is going to get the bishop out of the center shuffling to its home Square potentially going this way or he's going to try to play for D5 okay D4 so now he has to play a little bit more passively now he goes for the KN he goes for the bishop he's going to get the bishop he's going to get AR's Bishop AR is going to attack his pawns Bishop D7 and he grabs the bishop and he undevelop the the night he undeveloped the night and he's saying arjent that's a free Pawn you see it you want it you like it I got it that was a very butchered seven rings by Ariana Grande Rook F1 C5 look at this F of trying to fight with all his pawns meanwhile Ari's got potential attacking ideas over there take take aragi says let me get that Target the bishop Target The Pawn on F7 easy defensive move here Bishop E6 now arigi dances around with the Knight to the F4 Square slowly he's going to probably plop that Knight into D5 and then just fire away on F7 very complicated game now we have ABAB every he trades the Rooks and he plays Queen H5 pressure there pressure there pressure there pressure on all of those pawns and remember FV is FV is um he's uh he's down a pawn he's down a pawn so Queen B8 Knight F3 Bishop C4 and we get into this mad scramble what FV is using the G Pawn he's using the pawn in front of his King and where is argent's Queen going nowhere it's getting forked so he's got to come back he's got to pin the pawn to the king now we have a trade Bishop G7 blocks the pin so the Knight is hanging look one two 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 black is down a pawn yet he is the one playing for a win that is what we call Chad Behavior this man is playing for a win it doesn't matter that he's a pawn down cuz he doesn't care he's trying to win the game at all costs it's incredible absolutely incredible stuff um now uh we have Bishop B6 I'm mildly distracted because I just realized I forgot to include a a game in today's recap and I'm going to include it live on air like I'm going to put in the game because it's so completely ridiculous that I have to show it to you uh after we cover this game King G2 Bishop B1 and my man Vladimir FV completely walks down argent's pieces gets into an end game where he's just better and goes from a pawn down to a pawn up and is just completely winning what is h what is what is that what is what is chess.com doing oh my goodness who what was that about goodness me what was that what this whole recap is cursed oh my God I I can't even go forward quickly cuz all right King G4 Rook C6 and that pawn is just too strong that pawn is going to make it the entire length of the board board and my man fed of cleans up house Bishop E5 Rook F6 Rook C6 and he's going to get the Rook down to the first Rank and he's going to promote and that's exactly what he does slowly but surely if this chess.com apparatus does not break again what a cursed recap this is a this a very I'm having a very goofy time here this Pawn is ultimately the hero uh the amazing thing about this game was that F have managed to do this while just being a clean Pawn down like he just just straight up played this whole game uh clean Pawn down very very impressive stuff from him now um I'm going to re I I'm really scared I kind of don't want to refresh because I feel like if I refresh everything is going to break um so on the women's section we had um meu who's 13 years of age from China and yesterday she took down the Women's World Champion Challenger and she Drew the challenge uh she she she Drew she drew the World Champ I mean what is I this is CRA what is going on today let's just hold on I think it's the dress code I we need a little timeout little I've never taken a timeout in the video but I think I'm just going to just take a deep breath reset okay I don't know what's happening today um but I definitely the rest of this recap is going to be fire all right I mean yeah the pieces moving like that that really caught me off guard cuz if that's going to happen that's going to be really annoying this is a Spanish 13-year-old Prodigy from China playing against very strong Polish player kobasa and this game was nuts so kobasa early on just goes for a monster attack look at this she puts all her pieces on the king side she's attacking the young Superstar from China Superstar from China plays Knight D5 Knight G5 starts firing back with her own pieces trades the Queens because you know if there's no Queens on the board you're not going to get m in now we have C6 we have H6 and the Knight goes back that pawn has been hanging for like 10 moves and uh black says you know I don't I don't care about the pawn I don't care about the pawn I'm just going to smash open the center the bishop cuts the king the bishop is coming here we're going to open up our Knights we're going to open up the Rook white is going to try to promote over here D3 black marches into the white position with F4 we have takes takes locking the door but now C5 ripping open the queen side it's like black has a pawn at at the right moment every single time here comes Bishop G4 Bishop F3 ideas look like Checkmate E5 Knight comes into H4 this is literally a Checkmate threat that's now it's made because Bishop G2 you take white has 20 seconds she plays Knight G1 black walks in with the pawn but it's a mistake black should have played uh knight uh Knight I think Bishop F5 here or Bishop B6 was the winning idea but instead oh my goodness this is a queen but she can take and she loses the Rook but when the dust settles white has a pass Pawn and another monster win for Meo Yu who has just been destroying in this event she brings her King back to safety black stries to still go from eight but the queen is on the board the Queen is on the board so the black pieces are distracted they're going to have to trade and when it's all said and done white is just completely winning up a full Bishop Meo Yu is destroying people in this tournament she beat leting she beat uh she she beat Olivia kobasa she Drew against J and Jun she is on fire she's she's absolutely on fire another matchup from uh from the women's side Anastasia uh bodar ruk I mean Rook is literally in her name how are you going to compete with this individual seriously E4 C5 we have Bishop B5 this is actually uh this is a line that I've been playing a lot recently not Bishop C4 I've been playing Knight F3 but I really like these systems because they lead to some super complex imbalanced positions takes takes and now white just gets a big Center White white plays Bishop C2 Bishop E3 and just enjoys a very very pleasant position Bodner ruk plays Rook C1 and now it's time to attack Knight to G3 Queen to H5 and clearly just playing for a Checkmate Knight goes to G6 Knight goes to F5 bodar ruk is just trying to Checkmate The Grandmaster opponent from China Knight on F5 Bishop's pointed at the king queen G4 poking prodding whoop queen is hanging eyes there H4 h on the way potentially how can we break into the position let's start by trading you can't take with the Knight because this is made and now I want to trade the Bishops I want to open up my Rook that's the idea Bishop takes but there's it's not that I want to take like this in this position she plays Bishop F7 an amazing tactical sacrifice the idea is to not only take like this and have the rook in the game it's to play Rook C7 when the bishop took on E3 it removed itself as a defender of C7 white breaks through and the king is collapsing we are going to take we have tripled pawns but you know what hurts more than tripled pawns Checkmate Checkmate hurts more than tripled pawns we saag The Rook to get the queen in but when the dust settles as always there's an escape path we grab a bishop we're on our way out and um the person wh uh whing winning the women's section after two days of play is actually Anastasia bodnaruk who has uh I believe seven points out of eight I got to check that but I believe it's seven out of eight that's pretty monstrous or maybe it's seven out of it's seven out of eight yep s out of eight um while we're here it's time to check in on uh on prodigies let's check in on prodigies uh and uh I I and and you know I told you I was going to add a game well here we go I am about to add a game that I was going to tell tell you about uh Prodigy watching this event is completely Ely insane the young superstars around the world this is Roman shv and this is Johan Sebastian Christensen who is a Norwegian Grandmaster all right he's a Norwegian Grandmaster I'm not going to pull up their photos yet it's going to take a little bit of time this is an 8-year-old Russian kid who is rated 2000 they play a fried liver they play some some Cutting Edge Theory some good stuff all right we get to a position that's pretty much in the balance Queen E4 F5 and we have a we we simplify down Knight goes back to F3 and and and and the eight-year-old kid against the experienced veteran Grandmaster is going to try to win an endgame he grabs himself a pawn Rook E7 he comes back B5 trying to put more pressure and now E4 Christensen is looking to create a fight C4 whoa look at that if you take on D3 I'm going to try to I'm going to play Knight E5 and maybe get my Pawn on B7 Christensen plays Rook D6 now C5 Chasing The Rook down very tactical complicated game you can't take the pawn because of a Fork so Rook A6 but now Pawn takes and now Rook e one I'm trying to win your Pawn Rook E8 Knight B5 still looking for Forks trying to kick you out Knight goes back to C3 and now we grab the pawn and maybe Rook B1 maybe Knight E7 IDE is all over the place Rook e five Rook D1 balance game we're in a scramble less than a minute night B4 Rook e one checking checking checking again now we're grabbing some pawns we're down to very very limited pawns Knight D3 Knight C4 shuffling we've now made it to 50 moves King G2 okay Roman is just taking his time Knight before check knight3 oh my goodness 95 is the young kid winning is the 8-year-old 2000 going to be oh my God oh my God he's got pawns I'm not sure his pawns are faster than his opponent's pawns they're Off to the Races H6 H7 oh my goodness R oh he's winning he's going to win the game they promote and he's going to this 8-year-old kid just beat a 2500 level GM Johan Sebastian is like 2600 Fay this dude is eight he's an eight-year-old this might be a record literally this might be a record of this tournament I'm pretty sure I saw that Roman shv is eight years old if he's not if he's like 20 I I I don't think he's 20 that's insane other Prodigy watch we have foso Oro foso is the is the Argentinian kid he's 10 years of age and there's got to be more in this event falo is playing against Dennis hism matulin Russian Grandmas this is a filor defense the game itself is very much in the balance it's quite complicated it's very a lot of maneuvering a lot of a lot of tension among the among the pieces and what happens is they trade off a lot of pieces and get this position where they have the same pawns on this side of the board and these pawns are probably into like the PA these pawns are probably just going to fall off and die that's probably what's going to happen all right so G6 Knight H4 but the thing is he's Mulan wants to beat the young man but how how's he going to do that how's he how's he going to beat him I mean really how do you beat a child anyway Rook D6 take that clip out of context in chess Rook B3 King G it's a balanced game but black doesn't have a lot of time look how fast falo is playing he has a massive time advantage and what happens in this game I think you know where this is headed my friends bino's just a pawn up in the scramble in the scramble Dennis just he can't there's not much he can do so now he has to play to to not lose he was playing maybe to win earlier because you know he's more experienced he's higher rated but instead of that with 10 seconds on the clock King G8 Knight G4 here is winning but foso misses it but he gets another chance because black is geometrically stuck he can't move Queen da Check you have to block you're going to lose the Knight falino Oro takes down a 2500 level gam these are eight and 10-year-old children falo is crushing by the way he's having an incredible run this this guy really is the Messi of Chess I I am not joking it is really incredible stuff now another matchup to determine who is going to be at the top we have Barat subra manam who's a young Grandmaster from India he's a beast by the way like in his whole career and here he was like six out of seven he's playing Yu yangi from China this was a this was a very instructive game it was a very very locked caroan was a caroan defense where the position I mean this is just this is Goofy Goober Behavior with King to E2 the position gets very locked early they trade a lot of pieces and um we'll get there in a second we're going to get one more trade there we go so we have this position this is what we have to work with white obviously I mean this is some double two sets of double G pawns open F and open H files the way you play close positions is you look for your infiltration spots you look for the most optimal places to place your pieces so boink boink boink boink apply maximum pressure to your opponent's weaknesses and you need a pawn break so both sides only have have one Pawn break so the position is almost completely dead but it's not and now Yu yanki has to defend himself he's got a he's got a poke and he's got a prod he's going to find it maybe try to find his way and you see there there's the repositioning now at some point B3 B3 is a major move because then you're going to just try to bulldo that's what you're going to try to do barath is waiting but he's down a lot on time King D2 King C2 oh y yangi Zips down the other way and this one absent-minded move Rook C7 is going to cost him why because of this this is a gorgeous look at this idea letting the Rook die letting the Rook completely die in the corner because there's a discovered check that's going to win a pawn and get the rug back and barath is unfortunately losing the pawn Falls and the infiltration has occurred you can create counterplay but there's nothing and the problem is that you have too many weak pawns so yui patient game slowly bited his time took his time Knight D6 he's going to win the pawns and like like a carousel on the other side of the board they're just all going to go now all the pawns are going to go there is absolutely no way to stop them Yu yangi a very very nice win this one goes into the 70s does it make it to the did it make it to the 80s no made it 77 moves and this Pawn's just not getting there in time and barath resigned uh so Yu yangi clutches it out F of clutches it out Magnus Carlson clutching it out as well but in this game Magnus was cursing himself this is a a very uncharacteristic game from Magnus a game that we we we generally see him win like a hot knife through butter he's playing against Vincent kimer uh very very strong German player top 15 in the world now it's a Spanish it's Knight C3 a sideline I think Magnus played this yesterday big sideline because generally white tries to use these pawns like this so we have B5 D6 normal stuff Bishop G4 kimer trades the bishop and then damages magnus's pawns but Magnus wanted that as you can tell from his time span because he gets a very quick D4 you may wonder why did this not happen I think kimer did not want to give away the D5 Square I think now D3 and then Bishop G5 and then this is misery allowing this Knight to live there is the Maroon 5 song I am in misery I don't know why this turned into karaoke but it is what it is castles D4 and well here's Magnus doing typical Magna stuff no Queen trade Magna is not thinking not thinking at look at this every move he's not not thinking at all A4 trying to get kimer to come here so then he can reposition the Knight on the C4 Square kimer says no Rook C1 Rook D1 maybe we're going to get yeah there's the there's a knight reposition occurring Knight goes to D2 typical Magna stuff repositioning his pieces creates imbalance he wants Knight versus bishop or maybe he wants to damage the pawns he wants Knight versus Bishop look at this he's he's look how fast Magnus is playing he's up 10 minutes on the clock this is a 15minute game of chess and this dude is up 10 minutes on the clock that is unbelievable Rook B6 takes kimer okay gives away the C6 Pawn Magnus doesn't want it yet Rook B8 Rook D3 Rock Solid defending he's stalling a little bit because kimer has two minutes he has two and a half minutes to defend himself Rook B3 at some point kimer is going to do something goofy now we have a queen versus night end game this is typical typical magnus's Behavior he's going to try to try put as much pressure here now he trades the Queens that's a big decision but he's got weaknesses to work with and the king is very fast you see Black's King is is a little bit slow like The Bishop's got to get out of the way he's got to play defense Bishop d8 giving up the pawn whoa but you can't take it because actually the Knight is trapped very clever defending King G6 Magnus is up 10 minutes his opponent has 90 seconds left for the entire game at some point Ker's his nervous system is simply going to get overloaded Knight E7 King F1 Knight D5 oh my goodness Here Comes F5 wait a minute there was a moment here Magnus had a big he he had a big opportunity it was Knight C8 Knight A7 Bishop C7 and then around here Knight F5 was the computer's Choice Force the bishop back go here and then the second you get kicked out you reposition the king can't really go here because King D3 and Knight D5 kicks the Knight out he's a nice way to get mated um Magnus had to reposition his Knight to D not to D5 but to F5 but he went here and suddenly Vincent kimer with 20 seconds on the clock 20 seconds versus 1050 this is a 15minute game of chess and a guy has a near 11 minute time Advantage 10 and a half minutes that is wild he's up 70% of the entire a lot of time but Vincent kimer defends himself and right here Magnus was cursing there's a moment of him on camera where he literally was just like he like lean back he couldn't believe it I mean this is this is how Magnus has ruined careers we just saw the game against uh we just saw the vidit game completely death symmetrical night end game he always works a magic but in this game he lets an opportunity slip and kimer ridiculous defending ridiculous defending a sensational defensive effort and he ends up in a position he's a pawn up he's a pawn up but there are still chances for white but he just there's nothing he can do and uh you know Magnus can work as much magic as he wants but he's not winning this game so this one ends in a draw an incredible like Herculean defensive effort from the young man from Germany amazing game from Vincent kaima and this these are the standings after two days 777 for Carlson F of yuang that's why I covered their games but two Indians up top as well Eric gangy and bat suban we also have vided there with 6 and a half they are half a point out of first place I did not mean to cover three games where Indians lost today that's just sort of how it shook out there was a lot of draws Anastasia bodnaruk with seven leading the womens's we have humpy koru lot of Indians up top I mean just amazing half she's half a point out of first place she still has a great chance to win it um chess drama as always dress codes being violated personal laptops and lounges and headphones and everything and I can't wait for uh for for the event to conclude tomorrow and then the world blz begins friendly reminder holiday sale is still going on you can uh fulfill a New Year's resolution or get a friend a present till next time though get out of here
