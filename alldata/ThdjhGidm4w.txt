we are going to be doing what are we doing today we are going to be coding together today we are going to be coding in Python more specifically automating our lives today though automating our lives with building ourselves our own games in Python this is something that is super fun to do whether you are an experienced engineer or maybe you are just starting out in your coding journey and you want to start building some really cool stuff I thought this would be a good idea to do build a few small games together because it really even if not maybe you developer for many years but you haven't dabbled is that the right word in Python this is a great way to get familiar with it learn a bunch of the basics or maybe you're as I just mentioned starting out your career en coding I feel like there's nothing better that helps solidify your learnings and actually building something you can use and that is what we are going to do today let's get into [Music] it okay no we can't we can't code sounding up right now we got to sit down and focus this is so frustrating we have our first blocker already which is my mouse and keyboard died we're going to go sit at the dining room table and get this done all right we are finally seated ready to go I have uh there should be like a meme of how many drinks a programmer or really anyone can have at their desk so have one but this is empty so it doesn't really count does it count two fizzy water then I have like this really weird random three which is uh Toronto Maple Leaves CU I Toronto Mar oh no yeah Toronto Marley's so it's not even the Maple Leaves but uh from Toronto because as you know I live in Toronto or maybe you didn't know and now you know anyways that's my drink update comment down below though how many drinks do you typically have at your desk at a given time usually I have about two coffee cups so this is a big win all right let's dive into it before we talk about the projects we're going to be making I want to share with you where we will be working today which is in reppel you know I love repple for a few reasons one being because whether you are an experienced engineer or you are just starting out this is a great place to be able to build quickly no repple does not sponsor me but they really should because I feel like I'm always sharing about how much I love them all right so let's go ahead and create repple I selected python so you are in a python envir enironment this just is so I really like it because you can start building right away start focusing on the things you actually want to focus on versus setting up your environment which is important too but in this case we're building fun games all right the first game I want to share with you I have it here on my other computer if you see me looking this way uh this one I thought was pretty cool because when I was making this list I was so nervous I thought you know everyone always is making python games what is going to differentiate our games and of course I thought let's make some really cool ones so the first game we are going to make it's called called a virtual pet simulator so this essentially this code of pet this game is going to have attributes such as hunger happiness um different things that we give it so it feels like it's like a little code pet all right let's get into it so the first thing we need to do is import some packages or librar so import uh random and import time and we'll get to why in a sec here this is going to give me some uh okay we had some issues the fan was going everything was like falling apart but we're here all right so what I did was in order to fit uh a few games into this video I'm not going to walk you through my typing and and being really boring with that but rather going to type some things out and then we can walk through what is going on together so I imported random in time there is an import block is unsorted or unformatted just ignore the error cuz it will run so we don't need to question things I'm just kidding you can um but it's totally fine it will still run run so when we scroll down here you can see we have a class pet and this AIT function will or you can think of it as a special method that will run when a new pet object is created so every time a new pet object is created this will run and what it will do let me zoom in here is it will essentially initialize the attributes of each attributes of each Pet So as you can see here self is referring to the current pet instance name is the name we are giving our pet which is past into AIT and as you can see here pet is Lulu um I don't know why I think Lulu is kind of a cute name I had a bunny growing up and it was named Bonito but my friend had a bunny growing up was named Lulu this video is I think I had too much coffee this video is taking a lot of different terms here so anyways continuing on that we have hunger uh W and happiness which are attributes they're starting at zero and then they will continue to accumulate more numbers as we are satisfying the algorithm or satisfying our pet not algorithm you shouldn't speak to it that way then we have feed which is a method that reduces the Pet's hunger by one and prints this message so every time you do feed it will reduce the hunger by one it will say selfname is Happy hunger reduced then we have play which is a method that will increase the Pet's happiness and print this me of happiness is increased and uh the status so you can see current hunger level and current happiness level so let's go ahead this code is not done yet but these are just what we are going to be doing between feed play and Status let's continue coding okay we are back part two so we have now added a bit more code to this so we can see here user Choice input so we'll see this little arrow is this what this called arrow and if user choice is equal to feed then feed the pet same with play same with status and same with exit so let's go ahead and run this code all right run you can see I was running it earlier 6 minutes ago actually all right so as you can see this is the Arrow we are getting I feel like the prompt should be a bit more noticeable than that I don't know let's change it to talk to me that mean I don't know that makes me feel a little bit better let's go here thank you all right all right so now talk to me um let's go ahead and start with feed Lulu is Happy hunger reduced now if we go feed again did you hear that that was my stomach if ground so much um okay so you can see it's always keeping on reducing to ne1 now let's go ahead and yeah you know how we could improve this if you want to spend more time on it is because it's just every time it's running and going back to1 the next step I would take this game is making it so yeah I don't know if I love that I want it to keep on accumulating versus just staying up with the same number okay this is a you know this is a work in progress we can continue iterating on it it okay let's go ahead and do play play with Lulu playing with Lulu happiness increased okay now let's do status hunger level happiness level this is a bug okay talk to me play with Lulu play there we go that is working as expected now what is going on with Hunger well before we do that feed play status okay let's go back to Hung let's try it one more time hunger reduced to Lulu is happy oh it's one sec here now let's do status again so it's accumulating it's just not there okay let's figure out what is going on okay everything seems right I actually ran this through uh chat GPT to get its take on it and it gave me a few ideas but I think at the end of the day it's just not um calling no it is calling feed it's so interesting I'm curious to hear we're not going to solve this I don't think here we go uh Play One play two feed one and feed starts at zero feed is one yeah it's going to I feel like it's something super obvious I'm missing but you know what that is coding in real time um but anyways this is a super fun game to play and I think at the end of the day okay leaving a bit of the debugging but then we're going to switch quicker than PL okay you know what we're going to do we're going to shift gears because this project is something we are building for ourselves we can do that I actually ran this code through chat GPT to get its take on um what was going on with printing out self. hunger and it's not honestly coming back as anything is wrong I can't see anything wrong maybe it's super obvious leave in the comments if it is but we're going to alter this a little bit just to you know we have to like end on a positive note I feel weird not ending on a positive note let's do Hunger let's do satisfaction is increased to do you know what is oh my gosh it's because okay we have to cut that like a lot of this out cuz this is way too long anyways do you know what was going on with the code why I was like confused is because this is what you know it's end of day we have pet hunger down here you probably were screaming at me when building this this is the reason why I thought so I was I so I built this project a few days ago and then now I'm rebuilding it with you and I was like something is going on but when you scroll down you can't hardly see it oh my goodness makes me feel so much better I'm so happy to end on such a positive note anyways really fun project uh to automate your life to build a pet automatically if you will and uh actually speaking of pets I'm going to put on screen here Mr mugs this morning had his girlfriend come over I guess if you want to call it that who it's the one dog he cannot get enough of so I'll put it right here he won't leave her alone it's a problem he's obsessed with her and she just is like I don't care about you I'm too cool for school anyways now you don't need an inperson dog you can have your own pet and you can really customize this this is super simple logic a super simple project but it really lays down a lot of the foundations which are key especially when you are learning python I hope you enjoyed this and found it valuable going through the code what is happening and uh taking this and really making it your own all right I will see you all soon leave in the comments other things that we should automate with python and if you haven't already hit that subscribe button bye everyone
