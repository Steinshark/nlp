- This is the Impossible Maze. - I'm making it rain on you! Logan Paul, Logan Paul, Logan Paul. - Me and my crew spent days designing and building a maze that would be nearly
impossible to complete. The reason the maze is so hard to complete is because you have to
recreate some of my old videos in order to pass certain parts. Like at one part, you have to say "Logan Paul"
1,000 times to proceed. - Logan Paul, Logan Paul, Logan Paul. Logan Paul, Logan Paul,
Logan Paul, Logan Paul. - Another part, you have to ram a LEGO car into a wall. You see, the whole maze is
modeled around all my old videos, and in order to complete this maze, you basically have to
recreate all my videos. One last thing, you guys know I just hit
7 million subscribers, so the person competing in this maze is my 7 millionth subscriber, I flew him down, and he has 2 hours to complete this maze. If he does not finish this
maze in under 2 hours, he does not get 7 million underscore,
underscore, underscore. If he finishes this entire
maze in under two hours, he gets 7 million underscore, underscore, so make sure watch to the end because if he does finish, it's gonna be really cool what he gets. And, boom, your 2 hours
has officially started. - All right, good.
- So, first thing's first, "Buy a car with pennies." Give us the pennies, man. - How many pennies? - You have a wheelbarrow.
- All, the whole wheelbarrow. Come on, man. You have 2 hours that's dwindling down. - All these pennies is mine? - Now you have a car. I think you should try to go through that wall
of duct tape over there with your car. See if 1,000 rolls of
duct tape can stop a car. - I have a different strategy. Oh. - Keep going. Stronger than me. There we go. - Oh, shoot.
- Oh, wait. - All right, next, as you see on the sign, read the sign out loud. - "Donate to attractive Twitch streamers." - Here you go. I've got
some money for you, man. - Aw, nice. - Oh.
- I'm making it rain on you. - Tyler, thank you so much for donating.
- Oh, yeah. Sure. - All right, keep going. - "Complete Minecraft maze." - Right here. Open up the laptop.
- Oh, shoot. - Wait, what does that sign say?
- Do 10 pushups. Yep.
- Yep. - Dude, you gotta do it.
- One , one. Two... Eleven!
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!
- All right. Okay, you win. That's right. - All right, you want to keep going through the maze? - Yeah.
- All right. - Oh, well.
- Aw, man. - It says, "Say Logan Paul 1,000 times." - Logan Paul, Logan Paul, Logan Paul, Logan Paul, Logan Paul,
Logan Paul, Logan Paul, Logan Paul, Logan Paul...
- All right, guys. You guys want to go get some
food while he does that? - Yeah, we'll be right back.
- Logan Paul, Logan Paul... - He'll be a while or so.
- Logan Paul, Logan Paul... Logan Paul, Logan Paul, Logan Paul, Logan Paul, Logan Paul... - Hey, I'll help him out. Logan Paul, Logan Paul,
- Logan Paul, Logan Paul, - Logan Paul, Logan Paul,
- Logan Paul, Logan Paul, - Logan Paul, Logan Paul,
- Logan Paul, Logan Paul, - Logan Paul, Logan Paul,
- Logan Paul, Logan Paul, - Logan Paul, Logan Paul.
- Logan Paul, Logan Paul. Let's keep going. - Need it to your exit.
- It's all about the ligma research, by the way. - You need it to exit the maze. - Okay. "Tie your shoe?" - Yeah, 'cause we tied
our shoe in every country, or state, something like that. - State. - Yes.
- All right. - All right, keep going. - Good?
- Yep, yes. That's a tied shoe. - "Build LEGO car." Will it work? - Yeah, you gotta... It says, "Build a LEGO
car." You gotta build it. - You gotta put every LEGO back on it. - Uh, okay. - Dude, this was a banger video, man. Make sure you build it
right so it goes off. - Did you get arrested? - Uh, I almost did. Didn't you watch the video? - Hmm.
- Fake fan. - It's almost like he
subscribed at 7 million. - Yeah, I'm sweating a little bit here. I'm not gonna lie.
- Well, maybe it's 'cause you're wearing
a suit and it's 100 degrees. I think you should ram
that car into that llama, and, if you die, please don't sue me. Oh, boy. - You guys, that hurt. - Are you still, are you good? - I'm alive. - Are you hurt or anything? - I'm good. Sorry about the setup, gentlemen. - Look at that car. We're about to do a replay. Replay! This thing, like, nailed you on the head. You sure you're good?
- No, I'm fine. I promise.
- All right, keep going. - This one, right here.
- Ooh. - Were you trying to float in the air using these?
- Yeah, I... Remember how I flew with the
balloons and leaf blowers? You gotta do it.
- Okay. I didn't wear a long sleeve
shirt just for this occasion. - Wow.
- It's Superman over here. - Take it off, take it off. - Is this going to get you demonetized? - I mean, we can blur it. - Aah, got 'em.
- Ooh! - Honestly, I think one balloon and one leaf blower is enough for flying. Whoa! He's flying. - All right, go.
- Guys, I can't believe he flew like that. That was insane. - Go straight through here. - If we're being honest, we couldn't get the drone to work, so just knock the money off. - Hey! - That's exactly how we did in the video. - That's it?
- Yep. - Wix. - Aren't they amazing?
- Yeah. - It's a great company that may be sponsoring this video. - Yeah.
- Wow. - Yeah, so we can afford to give you a lot of money. Play to keep going. You're almost done.
- Let's run. - Guys, I'm lactose-intolerant. - Are you really?
- Yeah. - We didn't do research. - Okay, totally okay. All right, we good. Permission to make a mess? - Yeah, go ahead. - Wow, you would buy the Cheerios that match your shirt. - That's how we do it in California. Thank you, guys.
- Just Cheerios. - Ooh. - Did you not realize that's a magnet? - No!
- That's the whole point. - It's impossible. It's like Thor's hammer. - Dude, before you shatter the bowl. All right, you just gotta eat
- Just one bite. - one bite.
- One bite. Oh, my God. - All right, keep going. - All right. "Build box mansion." - Yeah, remember that video where we built a box fort? - I saw that one, actually. How big do you want your mansion to be? - Dude-
- Big enough to get 5 million views, I guess. - Okay. - Look at this guy, he's
smart. Look at that. He used a box to hold another box. That's a pretty impressive box fort. - Yeah.
- Getting pretty high. I like it, five-story. - What a privileged guy. Five-story?
- Yeah. - Four-story's fine too, you know. All right, that looks like a
pretty solid fort. Continue. Just hit it, just hit it. See that timer up there?
It's still going down. All right, looks like you
might've hit a dead-end. Is someone peeing? - I think that's just our broom closet. - Oh, my bad. - Um, Wix? Just Wix it. - Yeah, exactly. All right. Looks like you
have to retrace your steps. - There's something right
here that I definitely missed. Aww, snap.
- Hey. You have to help that
speaker lose its marbles. - Whoa. - Speaker, how is your marbles? The same spot. - Challenge complete. Keep going. - Sweet. That was pretty simple. Okay, there's more money
to donate to Ninja, maybe? - This one says, "Take money from tree." Remember when we
- Ah, yeah. You guys had a money tree.
- put a money tree. - Okay, we're gonna take that out. - Gotta grab it all to complete it. - All right, I'm gonna
go faster here to work... What's the time at? - 21 minutes and 23 seconds... - Ah, it's only been 21 minutes. - Where's Ninja? - Yeah, find him.
- You gotta find him. - Keep going through the maze. - I bet you don't recognize
what video this is from. - No. It's from a storage unit video. - Storage unit video. Man, come on. - I watched that video,
though. I watched one of them. You guys milked it twice, right? - Ooh.
- This guy. - Milked?
- Hey. - Do you think this map is helpful? - Not really. I kinda see Pac-Man. Up here, we started right
here. This the end point. Not a map. Seriously
though, it's just a joke. - I'm just saying this maze is... Look at the roof. This maze is way bigger than you think. - Maybe it's just a prank. - Oh, What does this say right here? - "Break 4,000 plates?"
- Yeah. Well, we don't have 4,000. It's only four, like we did in the past. Throw it at that wall. - Geez. Hope you like it. - And more.
- Oh, God. Make sure you close your eyes.
- Sorry. How'd you do this everyday? - Yay!
- All right, keep going. Hey, there's Ninja!
- Hey, it's Ninja. - Hey, bro. I'm gonna donate some money. - Oh, sweet. Mr. Tyler donated $50,000. Let's go! - Is that sufficient? - Yep.
- I guess that's all right. - Two videos is old enough. Should there be a third video? - Should be a third. - Oh, yeah, Ninja. Can I have a clickbait Facebook thumbnail? No, ah, yeah. I like it when you do that. - Nice.
- That's another 20 million views.
- Perfect. - Thank you, Ninja.
- Sweet. - All right. - Looks like we've been here before. - This is where you had that drone. - Oh, no. I'm lost. - Ooh. Has he been down this path? - No, I don't think I have. Write "Wix" somewhere on your body. - You gotta find the marker. - All right.
- Where are you going to put "Wix" at? - Wix, the sponsor of this video, deserves some advertisement on your body. - I guess I'll go with my left nip. - "Wix." Wait, one more. Wix one's an X. - Dude, he's probably have
more sponsors than us. - All right, this is a game. "Pin the arrow on the clickbait." All right, put your hands over your face. So here's the clickbait. - Oh, man. Not the pleasure. - Do you moisturize that?
- All right. Stop 'im.
- All right. - Pin the arrow on the clickbait. It's on the wall. Pin the arrow on the clickbait. - Yep, oh. - All right, nice. - 100 million views.
- That's perfect! - No, wait, wait. Did he clickbait the shoulder or the boob? - What the viewers wanna see. - There you go! Good job.
- Yay! - There we go.
- All right, all right. - That's the wall you destroyed. - Get broke many walls. "Pull toy car," okay. That's the video where you...
- It's right here, it says, "Pull toy car," yep. - Click the gas. There we go. - Wow, you pulled a toy
car using a toy car. - That was pretty easy. Where's my 10 million views, right? Oh, boy. I gotta count to 1,000. Okay, that's 1,000.
- Yep. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18,
19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42... - Yeah, we'll be back in... You got it, man. - I'm telling you, less
breath, the easier it is. The short breaths, you know. - 101, 102, 103, 104, 105...
- There you go. I've got lots of practice on these things. Don't worry, guys. I'll give him the tip. 991, 992, 993, 994, 995, 996, 997, 998, 999, 1,000. - All right, let's go. Keep going, man. - "Watch paint dry."
- Yep. You can shout out. - You gotta stare at it.
You gotta stare at it, man. - So I'll just...
- How do you know it's gonna dry if you're not watching it? - Seems like it's drying
at a relatively quick pace. - That's dry.
- Yeah, looks pretty dry.
- Hmm. - Nah, needs a little more time. All right, it looks dry to
me, man. You can keep going. Continue down the race.
- Make sure you read the signs.
- "Look behind you." - You have ligma.
- God. - Now you really need to find the cure. - Some naked mannequins, nope. - Don't you want to
analyze those mannequins? - I guess. Beast... Oh, snap. Two biggest
hypebeasts in the industry. - I want you to knock their head off, whoever you think will lose. If you guess right, I'll
give you $1,000 dollars today after the fight.
- You serious? - Yep, knock one of the heads off. Who do you think will win? Don't hit... Hit the one you think will lose. - I think I'm gonna go
with pure physicality here. - Knock his head off.
- Slap his head off. Sorry, KSI. I know you hyped this up, but... - Looks like this a Zorball when I won a game of Fortnite with in the middle of the ocean. - "Munch on yeast and find
the key. Look at my muscles." I gotta go around. "Download Uber." Ah,
this is getting complex. - Wait, you read the
sign. You gotta do it. Uber, you gotta download Uber. - Remember?
- You have it downloaded? - Yeah, remember when I
Uber'd across America? - Oh, hey, yeah!
- Yeah, perfect. - Now you can Uber across America. - That was easy. - Now you gotta break
glass using a megaphone. See that glass right there? - Okay, yeah. Should I
straight up break it? - Yeah.
- All right. - There you go.
- Does that work? - Yes.
- All right. "Deliver 100 pizzas to
this dude," um, "Eat it." - Yeah, you gotta deliver 100 pizzas 'cause I did a video where I delivered 100 pizzas.
- Say, are those my pizzas? - Oh, that's Chris' pizzas.
- Here you go, pal. - Hey, there's my pizzas.
- There they are. - Good job.
- Bobbity boo. - Where's my $100- - Whoa!
- There's ants all over it. - Seriously?
- Yeah. - "Rock versus baby." Which is... Which is better for
breaking a glass window? Throw the baby at it.
- Careful. - Oh.
- Have to again. - Now test the rock. All right, honestly,
based on my observation... - I think it's the rock. - Sorry, baby, but a
rock's better than you. - Sorry, dude. "Light the matches." - Yeah, you're standing on the Giant Flaming Penis of Death. Yep, so you got the matches and you gotta light the
Giant Flaming Penis on fire. - Well, this thing is not really... I'll show you a secret. - Oh, the Giant Flaming
Penis is catching on fire. So what will we do if the
whole maze catches on fire and we all die? - All right, keep going through the maze. - All right. "Watch 'Dance 'til You're
Dead' for 10 hours." - All right, I watched
"Dance 'til You're Dead" for 10 hours. You have to watch it for 10 minutes, but I'm gonna change it to 10 seconds. Watch me watch it. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. Good job! - "Microwave a microwave." - Yeah.
- Okay. Um, I don't know how I'm going to fit this microwave in here. I'm just gonna go for it. I'm a big fan of microwaving things. - Hey, you did it! - I'm pretty pissed. All right. Seems about right.
- Lovely. - Reached what we would
call the hard part. - "Look behind you." - Oh, you fell for it again. What? - You have ligma. - 2.47 minutes. - Yep.
- Where's the fidgey? - Does this mean fidgets
are still rolling? - No, I watched the fidget spinner spin for 24 hours. You gotta watch it spin for 2.4 minutes. - It's a pretty janky fidget spinner. You ready?
- Ah, yeah. Spin it. 2.4 minutes. Ooh, ooh. Ooh, boy.
- Just dropped a hundo there. - 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47. - All right.
- 2.47. All right. "Blink 100 times."
- Yep. - Three, four, five, six, seven... - Remember, guys, I donated to Twitch
streamers when they blink so he has money. You know, $100 for blinking a 100 times.
- Thank you. - I feel weird recording this. - That's exceptional blinking. - I know, I feel weird recording this. I'm gonna get away. - Looks like having a seizure. You good? Stage five ligma, it's the final stage. - Guys, remember, if you have uncontrollable blinking...
- Sir, I can- - Guys, if you're blinking uncontrollably, that means your ligma's
getting out of control. I've really...
- I'm gonna save you, Ma. Yeah, 100 blinks. I'm going through this secret corridor. "Munch on yeast and find the key." I gotta get in the Zorball. - So we're running into an issue. He doesn't have a phone, and none of us have Fortnite downloaded, so act like you won a game and that'll be good enough. - Ooh.
- Yeah! - Victory Royale!
- Yeah. - O-ho, you found the secret door. - "Push cookies with fan." - Remember when we used 1,000 fans to push a car? Well. - Let's hope to God it works on three. - Wow.
- Oh! - All right, keep going, man. - But I am going to destroy this car. - Yep, destroy a toy car and buy my friend a new one. - These are slip-slippery shoes on. - "Eat burger with H3." - What's up?
- What's up, H3? How are you doing, man?
- Good, man. - It's good to see you, bro. Am I just going to eat it? - There's your burger, man.
- Oh. - What are you, not MrBeast? - This is all right. - You want some salt? - Yeah, yeah.
- Put some salt, man. Oh, man. - Yeah, the burger has been sitting there for three hours. - No, mmm. This is the best burger I've ever had. - I can't believe you're
hanging out with H3H3. - That's so cool, man.
- What's up, H3? - It's like you can tell it's H3H3 'cause it says it on his shirt. - Yeah.
- Yeah. - Can we believe he's Tyler because his shirt doesn't say Tyler? - Yeah. Am I a MeatLover then? - All right, guys. Every video to the day I die, better refer to him as
MeatLover instead of Chris. - Don't do that, please. I would like my name to still be Chris.
- Dude, now that you said, "Don't do that," they're
going to have to do it. - Oh, man. Ethan, don't
put it in the video. Bye, man. Good to meet you.
- Appreciate it. - Keep going. - Bye.
- Eat your burger. Hey, let's go.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. - Whoa, whoa. - Whoa, stop. Stop right there. I'm the mighty gatekeeper.
- Oh, okay. To get through me, I'm
just gonna get $3,300. - Serious? - Yeah.
- Serious. - So he got $100 every
time he did a challenge. To continue the maze, he needs $3,300. - All right, here's all the money, boss. Three, four... But this is only 3,200.
- How about that? - No?
- That's 100 short. - So you're $100 short. You gotta go back to the maze and find the one challenge you missed. - All right, I'm gonna
go speed race back, yes? - Yo, dinosaur. - Final challenge for you to pass through the gatekeeper. - Am I getting into this thing? - Yeah.
- I mean, if you want it, complete it. You gotta finish the maze as a dino. - All right. - All right, that's the $100 he's missing. You can de-suit. - Hey, sir. The sexy leg.
- That leg is the key. - And as you can see, guys, he finished it with just
under an hour to spare. - Wow. That's some time.
- Good job, man. All right. - Good job, man.
- Good job. Slide open the door for your prize. - I'm not ready.
- He's not ready. Opening. - Toilet paper.
- That's 7 million sheets of toilet paper.
- There we go. - Yay!
- Yay! - I'm having the runs
lately, so this should work. - Dude, try it out. Dude, this is the terrible quality too. - Worse than school quality.
- You got me? - Do you want this 7 million
sheets of toilet paper? - No.
- Thank God! Dude, I've really been
needing toilet paper. Um, is $7,000 enough to buy it off you?
- Yeah. - All right, here you go, man. - Man, thank you.
- Thank you. Dude, Chris, we got toilet paper!
- Yeah. - Thank you, sir.
- No problem, Tyler. - All this money is going
towards ligma research to save my mother who's
recently been diagnosed with ligma, so.
- What a brave soul. - What a brave soul.
- Thank you, guys. - Honestly, guys, come here. Everyone. Ninja, Chand, everyone, come over here. We must salute him. He's using the money for ligma research. Salute him. ♪ God bless our Tyler ♪ ♪ Our Tyler that we love ♪ ♪ From the Twitch streamer ♪
♪ I've never heard this song ♪ ♪ To the dinosaur ♪ ♪ To the ligma, what with ♪ ♪ blessed ♪
- Your bears! God bless him, for trying to end ligma.
- Thank you. - All I'm saying is we need
more people in America like him, that use their money towards ligma. And this is a overused
joke, so I'm gonna go home. - All right.
- Bye. Can I see just...
- Yeah. - Hey, H3. Here you go, man. Thanks for coming out.
- I appreciate it. No problem. - Honestly, I'm kinda shocked you flew all the way out here just to... - I mean, 100 bucks will
give me a plane ticket back to Cali easy.
- Yeah, all right. Let's go get burgers later, man. - Yeah, absolutely. Lots of salt. - Apparently, building a giant maze is actually really expensive. So Wix came in clutched and helped us out. Wix is an intuitive
