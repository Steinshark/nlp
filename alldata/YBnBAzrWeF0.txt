Thanks as always to Jane Street,
principle sponsor of the stand-up maths channel. The year 2020 is a census year here in
the USA and because the census of 1890 arguably led to our modern computers I
thought I have a closer look at how censuses work and what happened in the
19th century. To help me out I have of course a friendly American it's a Grant
of 3blue1brown fame who's going to be my reference point for all things
American. So in the US you have to have a census every ten years.
It's in the Constitution. In the Constitution yeah right so it's baked into the country
every 10 years you check every one and why is that.
I assumed it's for a house
of Representative stuff to choose how many people are gonna represent each
region maybe Thomas Jefferson was particularly liked data-oriented and
could foresee the importance of that but I have no idea that's great but that's
very early on that that's like 1700s we are doing a census every 10 years yeah
the problem was by the time they got to the 1880 census it took them eight years
to analyze all the data and they realized if they're carried on like that
the 1890 census would take more than 10 years so they'd have to do another
census before they even finished analyzing the previous one and because
in the Constitution which is famously hard to change they they didn't have an
option so what they did was they took some of the data from the 1880 census
and ran a competition to see who could analyze it faster it was actually one of
the employees of the Census Bureau who came up with a punch card tabulating
machine that did it so we're actually here this is the Museum of Computer
History near San Francisco which is why Grant has joined me have you been here
before maybe two years ago it's been a while so it'll be as much of a
playground for me as it is for you I think it's been like five years since I
was last here so a lot of computing a second wait a lot of every device from
five years ago it's not be any is a good point so we're gonna see if we can find
the original tabulating machine and was the first punch card machine or were
there like punch card machines before they were punch card machines before
that but they were like looms that's what I thought something associated with
weaving and like making textiles but not for
like data processing but I believe that Hollerith was inspired by train tickets
which were also punched they put holes in to log the person who had the ticket
they would they would punch it different ways Oh
anyone who had the ticket and where they got on with it we have your name as Matt so 'M' 'a' 't' 't'
yeah I think almost to the point of you've got a beard punch the
beard bit oh well a game of guess who but in I don't know people who know more
about train tickets can let us know but I believe Hollerith wasn't inspired by
looms who's mired by transportation tickets and in here they've got a
rebuild of the original machine so we're gonna find that we're gonna check out an
IBM machine we're running this afternoon also punch cards very exciting and I
will see if we can spot I want calculator we own I want to see
if they'll run mine you've got an actual punch card that we're gonna I don't know
if they'll let you put that in the machine unsupervised will let it go
please do not bring your own punished cards there was no rule against it no
signs yeah there will be after this okay so we're gonna head in till we can find we'll be checking out their ground I'm
looking at the sector this is the kind of slide ruler is that a predecessor to
slide rules I sort of like the angst of this slide rule user that's that's kind
of good to know that that's like the experience of the experts with it not
just me I very much like the giant slide rule which I believe is for extra
precision so we found the abacus section of the museum so where we've gone too
early I believe I love this one over here check this out there's actually a
built-in calculator so I don't know if that's like so you can double check your
advocacy on the side that's hilarious we've been really distracted by
mechanical calculators which I think if anything are too modern for where after
I swear we'll get to punch cards in a second but I've just noticed calculators
over here oh they got like the original HP Brown
has discovered a drawer full of oh my goodness look at these it's got a little
professor that is like James Grimes absolute all-time favorite calculator
that's where his nickname came from wait really the little professor oh that's
why I made that out no no he's was a little professor for very different
reasons there it is there it is it so this is it that is the h√∂llerer happy
waving machine any questions do you have any idea how this worked okay so here's
how it works once people had filled out their census form they were entered into
punch cards using this machine over here this is a kind of like a punch card
encoder so people would read the handwritten notes they would move around
this thing to point to the right bit they want to punch and then up on the
arm it was punching holes into a card and so because you've got these guide
holes it made it a lot more accurate oh so it's like a way of making it bigger
for you to just like punch amazing this is actually a very cool video online of
a old lady named bubbles who as a teenager had to use one of
these to do data entry that's person and they put her in front
of one and she's like oh yeah but she immediately just quit often racing it
was incredible so they would just get all the census
data punch it in the punch card the punch card would then go into this kind
of reading device and it looks like some kind of torture thing with posing
needles medieval torture mixed with steampunk design pretty much so you'd
put the card in there you would lower this press and the needles if there was
a hole in the card would go into liquid mercury underneath and complete a
circuit that's hilarious okay so the only the ones that made it
into the mercury would then have current going along that wire it would then feed
into all these dials these dials would use like a ratchet system so each time
they got a bit of current they would ratchet one over and then you just feed
in loads and loads and loads of cards and once you were done you would read
off all the totals from this why are there like thirty different dials are
they counting like the various different questions that people are asking
so all those dials you could set one to just keep a tally of all the cards which
had a particular answer to a particular question so I say like I live in Montana
and it's like the Montana title goes oh yeah how many people answered that they
were a farmer okay and at the end I'll tell you of all the cards you put
through this money said farmer but you could actually rig some of them to do
and statements so if you had a certain disease and you were a farmer and you
lived in a household with someone right and so some of these would only
increment if a combination of needles or whatever they are made contact it's not
technically a computer I guess and it's doing a I'm just doing an if it's just
heard ma'am is that your incomplete I don't know the models in the future
could do adding so this one all you could do is run loads of cards through
and get a tally so at the end of the day you would have to go through and record
all the information off the dials and then write that down somewhere
and then reset it all and start from scratch the next set of cards we should
say by the way that sadly this is a reproduction this is not the original
machine I found one original machine the Smithsonian have one oh but it's locked
away in the to press it's only in vaults somewhere I asked him we're not allowed
to have a girl one thing mmm now the really cool bit actually is over here
this machine on the side so you've got the main machine which you put the cards
in and you do the stamping thing and then they end up on the Tally's but this
this down here that's a sorting box and so what would happen is each time you
put a card in not only would it increment all the dials that you'd set
to record whatever information but one of these little lids would open and that
tells you which one to put the card in so as well as keeping a tally of the
data you were sorting the cards at the same time further data analysis so
that's why there's like this umbilical cable joining it up and depending on
what you've programmed the bins to be they would open or close and you just
bump file it in the right spot what was the throughput here how many that's
people could do incredible number in fact that number that's on the screen
right now that's another number to answer your previous question about 10
minutes 10 minutes so they won the competition Hollerith
made these for the census they would have process despite of being a much
bigger census they did it in six years so they brought the time down got all
through once Hollerith had built these and use them for the census they then
took them to other countries when hey you're doing a census - this worked in
America chew on it and then they started to try and sell them to businesses to
see if businesses would want to use these things to analyze their data like
insurance companies that kind of thing hmm
so sort of like marketing it as some kind of business machine yeah some kind
of internationally some kind of international business like machine
fascinating so when holler if made this for the
census he was just calling himself something like the Hollerith electronic
tabulating system he eventually formed a company the
tabulating machine company which in 1911 as some of you may know this story
merged with a bunch of other very similar companies because everyone got
in on me under crazy I was a real a real boom everyone a lot of startups in that
space they all merged as some of you may have heard of this they became the
computing tabulating system company something like that it was war words it
was really complicated there were a lot of yeah and then that was renamed to
become IBM so that became international business machine so what I love is all
our modern computers or at least IBM can be tracked directly to this ridiculous
device which is crazy I know this is an ancestor of modern computers Wow
incredible so of course there were some great computers along the way so we're
gonna carry on our journey through the museum and there are your spoiler
there's more punch card fun to come this guy processed thousand cards per minute
thousand cards of minutes which is what a hundred times as much as Hollerith
more manual processing my image of the Hollerith machine is there's just like
mercury splash lying everywhere it was not the era of Health and Safety I think
we're gonna see one of these in action later on so every nice that is some terrible cable management money made up yeah they traced the
boundary of a region and it tells you it's area
did you see via a differential analyzer it's basically a way to solve
differential equations directly you set the parameters of whatever equation you
wanted to solve and then like draw out the graph of it that's very cool this is the drive that got one of these
they turn off homeboy that's so huge all of that for five megabytes that's five
pictures right there somewhere in here there's like a
supercomputer they had a bench built into it I think it was a crayon
something you just sit down get comfy that is terrible cable management is
there a subreddit for oddly unsatisfying first-gen by Claude I had one of those
you didn't have like a Palm Pilot actually we did I never had one
personally but we like we dealt with Palm Pilots in school for some reason
this is the future gives you Palm Pilot well I've got one of those hats the
nuclear head yeah I got a pen noodlerhead
okay I definitely had one of those Atari 2600
you know I briefly had the world record the Space Invaders really on the Atari
2600 powell edition only i just spent a month
playing the game until I broke the record well done well done thanks grass just having a go at pac-man here
and it's definitely not going to get competitive
okay we've hit home consoles and now is my time to shine now I should say owned
none of these when they first came out okay but since then I have managed to
get Dreamcast yes satin yes n64 yes
mega I get Mega Drive I had when that came out that's an exception Jaguar
can't afford it whatever that is no I don't what some oh I don't know what the
Xbox is but didn't have that I did have the Speak and Spell though the Apple one
well as the original computer for 600 $66.66 ya know was quite cool but the
Apple one as you can see Steve Wozniak assigned the top of it with the walls Oh
awesome of course IBM lived up to their name
they continued to build giant machines internationally internationally produced
in businesses yam was a less popular and they continued for a very long time to
keep them punch card based things advanced a lot more since the 1890s and
we're about to see a genuine 1401 punch card processor sorta what do you call
them yeah I don't know a business machine they forget as punch card
process that's it and this one was built in the 60s we're gonna have a quick look
at it now and then in a moment they've got a public display of it doing what it
does sounds good yeah okay I was just given a very quick tour
of this sorting machine whatever clothes to look at we're also joined by Ben now
who has a computing channel link below so this will sort these punch cards and
each column on the punch card has 12 possible values and you choose which
column you want to sort and then there are 12 different bins so each of these
bins corresponds to one possible value and then each time you want to sort for
another column you've just got to stack them back up put them through again how
does this work so through to I is nine and then you've
got a subtract line to get this column I'm not doing that all right I already
made a typo that's extremely satisfy all right there is a top punch in a1 and
that B is a top function of two senators okay okay so that's wrong that's not bad so this is the IBM 1401 over here the
entry stations this is where you would punch cards that's the only way to get
the data into the system once you've punched your cards you can then use the
card sorter over here this will sort them on any column you want one of the
most useful things this was for apparently is if you drop to your entire
box of thousands of punch cards that make up your program as long as you've
used a few columns to have an index number you can use this to put them back
in the correct order and then load them into the machine using this this is a
combination of in and out it's a and oh this will be able to scan all the cards
that is the program all these different punch cards have different bits of
information on it I believe the early versions of the IBM 1401 you could only
use this later ones you could get the expansion magnetic tape storage so could
copy cards onto the tape and then you got you your program on that with it
otherwise you've got to keep re scanning at my Herron yes so you could go your
punch cards you could run them through this put them on the tape and then when
you want to actually do something this is the color of the CPU so I'll jump
round sorry the fast hide over here so that is the main process of this
everything goes into that it's all solid state so you just get the fellow chips
you would put them in apparently you have to pay more if you want to upgrade
to be able to multiply and divide you get new chips you put them in it cost
you extra money and then finally if you want to get a printout I guess I think
you could send stuff back to the punch card in out job but I believe the main
way to put it out was using the printer over here and this was a very high
quality printer for its time and over there that's a whole nother IBM 1401
they have two copies in here that one was from Germany where it was hired out
to companies and this one was used until 1995 to do invoicing for a country club
so everyone's drinks and everything like spend the country-club
we can put on punch cards that'll be sorted on this machine and then the
invoice is sent out Oh huge thanks to the Computer History
Museum for thing has come in run around do some filming if you're ever in the
mountain view area I highly recommend dropping by and seeing some of the
exhibitions they've got going on here I should also thank the principle sponsor
of my channel James Street so actually if you're into software development and
analyzing data Jane Street analyzed all sorts of data to solve complex problems
in the financial world so if you're into that kind of thing check out James
Street they support this channel they're amazing they mean I can run around and
do stuff like this and of course I should thank Grant over here of three
blue one Brown Fame if you're not already subscribed to his channel what's
wrong with you I'll put a link to it below
you've got the we've got the dazzling sequence we've got the doubling sequence
so this is the one they printed out during the demo and all all your
favorite powers of who are in there somewhere
we've got 200 in does it start at one or two do it starts at two that's it - okay
so if one is your favorite power of to apologize it's not on there so the hey
wow I was going to say we will give this to someone who's watched the video but
grants busy destroying it in the wind so you know we are both going to sign this
we will put it on the charity ebay account for stand up maths so if you
would like to have this ridiculous print out it'll be signed to by us and all the
money goes to charity I'll link to that below so that you are once again
thank you so much grant for coming on super happy to be here thanks for
letting me tag along boom
