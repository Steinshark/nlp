i just upgraded my home gaming setup to lg's 42-inch c2 and some things about it it finally went well what the hell i have it set to one minute this is what i'm talking about i just upgraded my home gaming setup to lg's 42 inch c2 and some things about it are great basically zero motion blur inky oled blacks and the size is perfect but using a tv as your monitor is less perfect thankfully asus rog who sponsored this video has the solution this pg42uq they sent over has all the same benefits of my existing display but none of the drawbacks of using a tv it's got displayport 1.4 alongside its hdmi 2.1 connection i no longer need a companion app so my display will go to sleep and wake up alongside my system and best of all i can disable that accursed auto dimming function for a much more consistent experience to say i can't wait would be an understatement on paper it's basically the perfect gaming display but just because it's sponsored doesn't mean i'm not going to tell you guys if i don't run into any problems [Music] right out of the gate massive shout out the developer of lg tv companion because it's a lot better than not having it but this was set to sleep after a minute it has been like five minutes and it's not asleep also there's no way to minimize it so you just just tuck it away also you guys noticed right when i moved that box the brightness changed dramatically you can adjust that behavior with a special service remote in the hidden menu but you can't disable it entirely probably the thing that's annoyed me the most though aside from coming back to the office right after setting this one up and seeing the better solution sitting in our warehouse is that i have been stuck at 60 hertz because my computer is so far away that i need an active optical cable in order to get a signal to it and while there are hdmi 2.1 active cables available in my case the cable is so costly that since i already own a long display port anyway even if the monitor version is a little more expensive it's a better bet a sue sent over not one but three of these which means that with some help from these little doodads which let you extend a usb connection over standard ethernet cabling i will be able to show you guys the final form of my centralized gaming system where it shouldn't matter if i sit down at it here sit down at it downstairs the experience should be identical no additional latency i can help you lift it when it gets to that i know it's super basic yeah i want you to follow the instructions jeff just told me that we've got to do this all right and it's sponsored so i'm trying to make sure we do it no i open boxes how i play oh my god oh my god all right there's a stand yep nice oh accessory pouch yeah i actually really like complete with color calibration report oh my goodness their calibration report comes in a little sleeve power display port hdmi usb it's really weird the instructions said specifically did they really did they remote this is pretty handy i mean it's nice to be able to turn it off and on remotely change sources all that kind of good stuff what else we got going here okay do you want to grab another okay i'll grab the other side okay according to the instructions okay david frame him out okay with a helper okay place it down like that that helper that definitely exists there's a lot going on here you've got vent holes up at the top is this a cooling fan no asus does advertise that it can be overclocked so instead of just 4k 120 it'll apparently do 4k 138 hertz but the cooling required to achieve that is all passive so you don't have to worry about any additional noise they also advertise 0.1 millisecond greater gray pixel response times out of box calibration which i showed you already as well as a whopping 98 coverage of the dci p3 color space pretty freaking impressive just like our screwdriver which is now available for order on ltdstore.com which happens to include the hex bit we need to tighten up our monitor stand here so you use the knurling for speed and then the handle for tightness love it i could totally lift this myself but asus insisted i have a helper so i've got ploof here taking the other end thanks blue that's really good all right oh that's super handy it's got a usb 3 port up at the top along with one of these little threaded majigs so that you can put your camera or your webcam or anything else that has one of these what are these quarter inch is that the one yeah quarter inch threaded posts on it love it oh that's nice i was leaning this so david could get a b-roll shot here and it's actually got a little bit of tilt which is something you won't normally find on a tv in terms of i o we've got oh really it's got the full complement of hdmi ports four of them along with displayport and this is a pretty robust built-in usb hub it's got usb 3 in here and then one two three i thought i saw another one somewhere i guess three is oh yeah there's another one down here four usb 3 ports there's your headphone jack power is here kensington here and i'm assuming this is rgb i guess we should plug it in and see it light up one thing that's conspicuously absent is e-arc so you're either going to be using the on-board speakers or speakers that are hooked up through an av receiver or similar now this is curious there are a couple more threaded mounting holes here pluth do you have any idea what these are for no it does vase of 300 by 300 well yeah that's not there yeah uh i'm actually not sure i never saw anything in any of the documentation yeah they're just labeled mounting port oh that's cool though yeah if you didn't happen to have an ltd screwdriver it does include a little allen key for the stand so that's neat it uses a little center mounted nubbin nipple thing for control so i think i just turned it on the rgb is not on by default i don't use rog who are you yeah it's got to be rgb right this is interesting the hdmi one and two our hdmi 2.1 3 and 4 are 2.0 so that's good to know oh no the power button is just to the right of the control nipple okay got it so did i turn it on this time if i'm going to fall off this desk i think we all want to see it on camera watch your back pocket cause you're with this oh my god yes yeah yeah don't worry i'm good i'm good i'm good you want to hand that yeah please okay yeah there you go yeah yeah okay here we go so heavy oh yeah there we go wow there we go yeah all right stan's a touch taller but you know what that's probably not a bad thing just means that i do need to move my camera a little bit apparently it's got a nice anti-glare coating on it which as long as it doesn't scatter the light too much i'd say would be a boon oh wow that is that is quite monitor looking i mean you look at the like david check out the lights i have behind me i haven't adjusted these i don't have any real diffusers on them or anything that's pretty good hey before we update the firmware let's just see if it's you know working at all 4k 120 uh-oh hey all right cool it works firmware update hey there we go while we wait for that we're going to head downstairs and roll this one out do you mind grabbing an end yeah here you go awesome thank you no problem good job whoa stairs oh yeah whoa you got to keep up pretending don't you happen to pull this you almost wait here you go there you go there you go that's awesome yeah so which station's yours this station is mine and right now the only problem that i have is that if the kids have their friends over and their friends want to play with them i don't really want their friends poking around in my computer so there will be a separate machine for them to use but for me i don't want to have to reset up all my profiles and everything just because i'm downstairs so the idea is i'm using this super cool high bandwidth displayport kvm from level one text to switch between those machines with a keyboard shortcut that my kids friends are unlikely to figure out but we had a problem the shortcuts only work on the mouse and keyboard ports and i only have one fiber optic connection over to that room that's where those ethernet usb extenders come in is this even gonna fit here it's gonna be really tight okay i didn't really think of that yeah i noticed that what i considered is that it would be really nice to have matching displays a so that you don't have you know different scaling or like a different experience on both sides and b because i didn't foresee this but having two mismatched displays even though both support high refresh rate has made it so that i can only get 60 hertz on both of them for now yeah it's so hefty oh thank you yeah no problem thanks okay oh all right hey it fits does it fit barely but i mean it looks like it does actually we could make that work yeah that is a really really big display to be on a desk this um deep i mean i was using a 48 inch before though so i think i'll probably be okay if you're not this comes in a 48. i cannot believe how long you waited for oh no it's definitely we shouldn't have dragged it down the stairs i don't think it's from that no you sure this is the traffic though no that's a crack it's an impact it's a crowd it's right here there is this is the one with the up box yeah it came to us like this like me and david did stack them um in his car but i don't yeah no no totally i don't think it's from us either and that is why you always legitimately use two people to move things around in all seriousness based on how beat up this box is we're fairly certain that this thing was damaged in shipping we probably made it worse we didn't break it we didn't know we did let's say that this is good news i noticed almost immediately that it wasn't very bright but ah yes we're in power limited mode there we go and immediately that is way better before we dig around too much in the menu i want to show you the thing that is so annoying about using an oled as a desktop monitor you see how bright this is when i have this window just in the corner here watch as i drag it across the screen whoa oh that's actually not that bad it's pretty noticeable though is it noticeable it's noticeable on camera and like i can see it's overexposed okay so that's what happens more annoyingly tvs just randomly start doing it sometimes while you're sitting and reading a document so this because it's designed to be a monitor it has a feature called uniform brightness you enable that and what happens is your maximum brightness goes way down like somewhere on the order of around 230 nits i think 250 280 250 to 280 but it means that when you do this you're not just going to get those those wild brightness swings is that it seems like it might still be a little it's doing a little bit yeah okay yeah not nearly as much okay let's turn on overclocking no dog i'm going for it 138 here we go might as well do 144 if you're already in does it do 144 panel doesn't doesn't say it does it doesn't advertise it no no we're going to test 138. only sanctioned overclocking here all right hey oh this is interesting one of the things our firmware update changed aside from making input switching a little bit faster is their screen saving functionality to make it work more effectively in standby mode you know how the arc could like change the screen yes it can do that so oh cool okay aspect control so if you want to play one to one or a 16x9 at a smaller screen size so you want to simulate what it's going to be like in your at your tournament right when you're playing on a 24-inch display you can set your monitor to be a 24-inch monitor for those of you who are wondering you're not stuck with your 24-inch monitor in the middle you can actually shift it around either way it's nice to have the option just like you have the option of signing up for flow plane where we have amazing exclusives like oh my god all the outtakes from the screwdriver video yeah i screwed up a lot hey wasn't driving you crazy this is the monitor that was supposed to end up on my desk at work because 48 really is a little bit looking around like that a lot uh is now for the downstairs and we are going to for realsies you got that size yeah i've got yeah carry it very carefully no dragging it down the steps i would never i would never do anything like that to be clear that was obviously not what destroyed the other one but it didn't help that's not funny this is not right this is supposed to just be the display upstairs cloned to this spot but because we haven't set this up yet it's not working i have never used one of these before but it looks super cool it's only usb 2 so it's not particularly fast but for something like a keyboard or mouse it should be perfect probably just going to mount this to the underside of the desk or something at some point but we're not there yet i swear it's going to be clear what's going on at some point here i'm plugging usb for the keyboard and mouse into my kvm so that that keyboard and mouse can be used with either of these machines then i'm going to take this network jack that comes out of that usb adapter i need a network cable this one's pretty long i have not organized my tech stuff yet it's the one thing that is left to organize oh you followed me yeah that was a lie there are some more things other than tech things that are not yet organized come on come on come on come on come on come on yes it's doing stuff okay this is where things get spicy oh oh no please not splice i just want it to work no this mouse doesn't work kind of expected the mouse and keyboard to work maybe i just need to use a different port here we go okay so pc2 will be yvonne's computer pc one will be my computer all right we're good is it on yeah no way okay but the peripherals aren't working yet okay i'm uh ploof yeah i'm gonna have you be my hands okay go for it nothing okay go for it nothing this is why i love these icon dogs they're super expensive like how much is that dock oh it's like six hundred dollars but it works what okay but this is just native this isn't through the kv the kvm this is through the kvm oh yes this is wendell's big thing is his displayport kvms or like yeah full fat bandwidth come on wendell don't let me down you know what i bet the prompt is up on the other one oh you might have to try again i think i'm gonna miss it you ready yup nope nope i've got one more idea wait yes i'm now getting no output to either display oh my god i think they got mad because one was in overclocked mode and one was not which was exactly the problem i was having before with the mismatched displays because they actually report back to the system differently if they're in overclocked mode maybe if we get in touch with wendell it's oh wait nope no no it's 60 but 100 100 i'd settle for 100 100 is fine whatever the fiber optic cable is outputting may not be high enough to get through all the connectors in the kpm plus the kvm plus the cable itself it is like i'm not just making stuff it is crazy how much better the air tables are than everybody else's and when you get like the 25 foot club 3d cable which is copper not fiber it's as thick as a garden hose it's amazing right okay i yeah we'll we'll try that thank you the keyboard shortcut also there are there is a way to make it the right control key and some other different keys it doesn't have to be scroll locked but you might temporarily need a five dollar keyboard that has scroll lock in order to use scroll lock to tell it which hotkey you want to use i might have just the thing here okay it's not five dollars but it has a scroll log key it would be really nice to know if that aspect of this works okay scrollwalk's not doing anything either i'm plugged into the wait oh no i changed the kvm hold on it might not be plugged into anything yeah no it's not plugged in one sec one sec okay so the head port i should use the front with the one on the front labeled hid yeah there's three in the back as well sure and those are all equally hid yeah well hid the only one you can do the keyboard control on because the usb usb 3 is completely hands off right but all four of those hid ports are the same right yep i am working on an hdmi extender that also runs over cat 6 and it is glory working on you say well a fat lot of good that does me today sir i can probably need you a prototype in like a few days no it's okay take your time okay i think it's just this usb extender i think it's just not working it also could just be mislabeled it's not wouldn't be the first time i saw that in this house is it possible the kvm doesn't have enough power for this bad boy because it doesn't have external power on the transmitter side nothing is working instead of running through the network cable in the wall we're just gonna run a cable okay hello either the in-wall cable is bad or it's mislabeled i've got an update for you as it turns out the usb 2 hid ports on the kvm they're not quite full usb 2. they're tailored for hid human interface devices what that means is sometimes especially if you have like a hub especially with a mac you can get odd behavior with these extensions so what i need to do is either get a different extension send one of these over to wendell maybe he can test it fix it the point is scroll lock scroll lock source switching is not going to be working today but damn it i haven't given up yet on 120 hertz we have an idea also to do with using the kvm and some funkery that wendell had to do to make g-sync and freesync work it's particularly sensitive to long runs and we have an extremely long run here and the more couplers we have in line the more signal loss he says each one of these connections is probably costing us about 3 db so what we're going to do is we're just going to run a little brush plate and we're going to take our optical cable and we're gonna run that bad boy ah straight into the back of the monitor proof yeah a hand if you will yeah what do you want put this i want that in the thing hey 120 oh no no no that's display one good try though come on come on crap crap come on that was our big idea screw it no kvm for now the kids friends have can have no computer damn it i'm going straight into the back of the computer if this doesn't run 120 hertz i give up we're going straight in are you kidding me oh yes matching displays there we go 120 hertz all right let's play a video game time to finally try this thing yeah oh look at that everything just works wow freaking love it oh i want to make it abundantly clear that none of the problems we had today were asus's fault for real though when you're trying to do weird stuff weird stuff happens sometimes man this looks good i love oled i don't even know what mode i'm in on this one it just looks great i don't want uniform brightness i want hd oh wait hdr setting is not oh check windows make sure windows is set to hdr yeah duplicating doesn't do hdr duplicating doesn't do hdr yes you can't duplicate hdr seriously are you even for real right now why is it like why are the settings all over the place that's competitive settings shadows it's legit actually whatever just don't even worry about it you know what matters this looks freaking great oh no oh no oh no oh no oh it's nice to know i have no idea how much of the 120 hertz upstairs and downstairs kvn switching for the guest machine usb over ethernet stories are gonna end up being in the video but the one thing that hasn't gone wrong today this monitor for real oh man they're still so many technical issues to solve for my idea here you know what i think we might have to do i think i'm just going to get like a nook or something yeah build a second floor just gonna have it no there'll be a second computer okay will be a second computer there will be a nook and i'll just have cables and i'll just plug into them when the kids have a friend over what what is this anno oh i know what game it is i just mean i i started in the in this world and i forgot i forgot i thought all my stuff was gone one of the big issues i had with my old oled was that with these lights on it was just it was they were so bright they overpowered the oled display yeah uniform brightness mode is actually on wow so then we're good well that's fantastic yes thank you for watching thank you asus for sponsoring this video did we even include like do you have it you've got you like measured stuff on this is there somewhere we could put that just like put it somewhere i guess yeah it's it's good it's good it's like actually good we actually measured it i know it's sponsored but we wouldn't lie to you it does the things on the box that it says it does everything it says on the box looks really good if you want this one or the 48 inch model we're gonna have those links down below where's all my crowds at yo get what they're just disappearing
