ladies and gentlemen prepare yourselves for one of the most unexpected collaborations that you could ever imagine in today's video I am going to be playing Clash of Clans bots on chess.com this is all part of an event that chess.com is doing with supercell the company that created Clash of Clans Clash Royale and so many other great games it's currently September 1st 2023 and for the next seven days there are going to be a ton of different game modes and this will all culminate in a massive event on September 7th so if you're watching this like six months in the future well you missed the event but Clash of Clans and chefs are collaborating isn't that absolutely insane how many of you play Clash how many of you play chess let's jump into it I am going to take on these new Bots and by the way they come with a custom field if you don't like this you could like disable it in settings if you're lame but you know it it this is a normal chessboard when you play The Clash Bots the whole thing changes all right to mimic the way it is in the game I'm going to play Barbarian I'm going to play giant I'm going to play Goblin Valkyrie hog rider pause which Wizard and Pekka and I think I will save the Archer Queen for last because I don't know what the heck is going on here I might make a separate video about Archer Queen but we gotta start with the iconic Barbarian uh let's play with the challenge and uh I'm gonna actually play the first game with the black pieces because I want to respect the Barbarian I'm a little bit terrified he says me Barbarian that's what he says Pawn to E4 on the board I'm gonna go for the iconic E5 is he gonna go for a little Scholars mate okay no night night two F3 small piece move um I'm going to defend with the Knight this is the iconic way to play chess Knight F3 Knight C6 and he plays D4 and he says Big Move that that's what he said he he said he said big move uh bot link is in the description if you would like to go try it out um some of the uh you know some of the some of the folks might not know anything about Clash I know a bit about Clash I haven't played a huge amount of it um but I'm gonna learn for the event so obviously we can trade I'm gonna put play this queen move to Target this and this very tricky move uh G4 is not a good move now this queen is something we call overloaded it's defending two things but I have this and if he takes Barbarian will lose in six moves okay he did not do that but he could still do that at any moment uh all right now the queen no longer defends that or that so I'm gonna take with the bishop and then I'm gonna take with the Knight he says bad funny hat man oh Barbarian not only loses his Queen but he loses a queen into a fork I guess that's why he's the Barbarian oh brutal brutal brutal oh and for good measure I can play this I can throw in a check that's called the zvichenzook uh in between move now I take the rook and yeah Barbarian is getting Barbarian or or something all right I'm gonna I'm gonna set him up for something I'm gonna take this Pawn he has take take and now Rook here will barbarians see that he can win my queen oh the Barbarian Strikes Back Now admittedly he's down like 20 points of material or so uh let's give a check and Escape I'm escaping I don't want my knight trapped in the corner now Barbarian only has two Bishops left so I think at this point I can just develop as many pieces as possible there's two ways to win a winning position one is to take all of barbarian's pieces he said no like like oh this in-game dialogue is crazy oh my goodness okay now we're gonna Castle long and uh there's two ways to winning position uh when it went in position uh go to an end game or oh we have one person I've got to do it he said gasp I suppose he doesn't know what that is uh go to an end game or try to deliver a Checkmate and in this case I am going to weave a Checkmate net I am preventing the king from escaping I'm gonna use both my Rooks and the only thing I need to avoid is stalemate since he has a bunch of legal moves left my Rook comes down and uh and this is just a double check and mate and he said uh oh now me angry okay well before he has a chance to you know beat beat my ass uh I'm gonna go play the white pieces versus the giant uh let's play uh let's play D4 he said that that's what his voice that's what his dialogue said he's playing okay I don't know what he's okay um this isn't exactly a speed run you know I still want to be instructive and I I want to give all the Bots a chance Knight takes Pawn that's not a bad move let me just Retreat back and now I'm gonna develop like normal okay uh nights before Bishops that's what my that's what my coach taught me what why would you okay uh let's give a check not not a great move not a bad move either oh my God what what okay I please don't move your d-pawn so I could go here all right developing all of our pieces we've got the knights out we've got the Bishops out I just wanted to get my Bishop out before I uh blocked him now I can actually take there's a nice little trap there nice little trick I'm gonna show you it uh the queen is going to be left undefended so I have what's called a discovered attack I can play Bishop check so I can take this Pawn it's only defended by the queen and if they take me now I have a discover check Pawn takes and then I take the queen so several things have to work here I can't take this because the queen would take but this works because it's an attack on the king and the queen uh and now now I am I am in fact cooking the giant I will go take the rook and then I'm going to take some other pieces as well like the knight uh and it should be made very soon uh Knight to E5 check I gotta have a mate somewhere that's that's that's my that's that's my uh Goblin noise King C5 okay Queen C7 the king is kind of oh will I get a pawn mate no Pawn mate somehow Bombay I have Queen mate in one but I want a pawn mate boom and boom Pawn mate yes very nice I'd be giant who said nothing to me after the game it's very disrespectful uh Goblin what is what is The Scouting Report goblins are rarely found by themselves prefer to hang around in groups that are very fond of sharp pointy things and gold that isn't theirs sounds like me um all right black pieces versus Goblin uh Goblin's gonna come and try to take my gold um this time I'm gonna play uh Scandinavian defense let's play D5 uh and let's bring the queen out and we'll rotate it over if the queen is attacked very good it's like this is normal stuff she's not coming for me is she oh oh wow he is aware of the queen um we'll pin it's not the best move but it is what it is uh develop try to get this bishop out as well what he said I know where you can get gems for cheap meet me outside in five catch me outside how about that he hung his Queen though uh my Goblin granny could have made that move Goblin why are you talking trash you literally lost your best piece you bozo now I I can't take this but I will go here um I can't take that because of the bishop oh my goodness these these these Clash Bots should really stick to clash oh my goodness I am taking everything oh now I can take and then I can pre-move this because the bishop no longer guards the oh no oh that's not a good move yeah because of that now I can move my queen but what's worth more than a queen a king check hit this hit this if King F3 it's made in one okay goes there I'm still still looking for a mate somehow not in life got one love my wife very much she's incredible but uh definitely this game all right Shaq and I'm getting my knights in I I can castle and I can play it slow but you know I feel like I feel like we got we got some good stuff coming here uh that's made in one right there boom all right Goblin Goblin was kind of trash he said he was only gonna rob me a little bit before all right Goblin no problem uh Valkyrie wields her two-handed acts with ease she can usually be found arm wrestling golems all right wow okay uh let's play D4 this game Let's Play D4 uh and let's play a London she said did you see that it's moved to Valkyrie like why do they program these but they don't even talk trash at the right moment they don't even talk trash at the right moment it's the second move keep them coming I why do they all do this is she gonna spot this move by the way no oh my oh that's not good that but it's still there I'm leaving it there just in case the bot sees it um the bot did not see it I'm you know playing my typical London here C3 finish up the pyramid need to lay off the Elixir before a battle does she say she has a drug addiction what what at Valkyrie respectfully I do not care H3 attacking the night now the night's gotta go uh and now you know now we'll play this London style we're gonna put our Knight into the center of the board here um and Valkyrie oh Valkyrie hangs upon and the queen is trapped anywhere the queen goes It's Gonna Get Taken oh and I don't even have to take I'll take the queen because I don't have to okay now I have to now I have to because the queen could come out this way all right I'm gonna take the queen oh my goodness no all right let's take the Knight and then and then the Rook is hanging and then the Rook is gonna move probably and now King is in the center we got an extra Queen we gotta bust it open we gotta bust open the position that's not a bad move attacking my Bishop I'll slide out of danger uh but we gotta open up the position here like this just trade opening up the queen now that this attacks this all right we slide out of danger I think probably Valkyrie is going to be duckery just called by Bishop a weakling you don't have a queen who are you trash talking will Valkyrie find this x-raying my Queen to my Rook no I'm setting up these Bots to succeed but they're refusing all right let's trade Rooks we're now going to simplify our opponent's position let's trade The Rook uh and uh now we have this nice move x-raying the Bishops to each other they cannot defend each other and the queen is just gonna you know the Archer Queen is gonna is gonna go do the rest of the damage my Archer Queen oh my goodness Valkyrie is just on tilt giving me all the pieces that's Checkmate oh my goodness you beat Valkyrie all right Valkyrie did not put up a great fight let's put it let's play against hog rider nothing comes between a rider and his hog this Troublesome Duo deliver Swift pay I'm not gonna the first time I heard hog rider I was like pause um all right E4 um Karo Khan my favorite they all play E4 let's play Carl Khan he's going for a Scholar's mate oh my goodness yeah but but this is just really bad because I'm gonna win his Center pawn and he's gonna get nothing he does not get to Checkmate me but he you know he's still gonna play aggressively I'm gonna develop my bishop and then develop my other Bishop I'm just you know I'm sticking to the print oh my goodness this this man is hog riding for sure that's about as good as his skill set goes he's just hog riding he's not moving anything else I'm castling I'm playing good principal chess then I might come here uh you know I can move my knight to the center I'm gonna move my knight in like this hog rider oh baby no the rook and this fork and oh he's getting hog ridden hog rider is getting his hog ridden Knight to E3 I take the queen and then I'm gonna take everything take everything opening things up let's trade some pieces when you're up I'm gonna trade the bishop for the night trade this bishop I'm gonna get a lot of pieces off the board here so he can't hog my ride and I can't ride his hog everything is good Queen all the way down the board it's not a good move but you know we'll we'll do it anyway uh we got eyes here we got eyes here we got eyes here that's free which means that's free as well and that's free whoa almost hung my queen that would have been bad so we're up a lot but we still gotta win we gotta get to the the we gotta get to his King uh let's sneak into his back rank with my Rook I feel like that's also a clash strategy there we are pressure this pressure this after this the level of the Bots does go up a lot um let's double up so Rooks are powerful um and that's a nice move hitting the rook and the the lose Bishop uh we could take the bishop because the bishop guards the The Rook there we go very nice cleaning up uh and now we just gotta we just got a barrel in here just got a barrel in uh we gotta be a little patient maybe give a check if King here I'm sure we have a mate somewhere this is mate now and there it is Queen D1 his hog was ridden and it was written by us sad hog noises is what he said uh we got a couple more bots in today's video The Witch Archer Queen We're Gonna Save let me know if you want me to play the Archer Queen Mistress of Darkness is loved by all skeletons she looks dangerous but is a big softy okay terrific thank you for the dating profile report um Dreadful to meet you French defense all right two Pawns in the center nice and principal chess what why do they all do this this is not you can't play like this but I gotta be a little careful you do have to be a little bit careful here but let me be an intermediate player and blunder my Pawn oh no I hung my Pawn all right I'm down upon but I gotta get developed she said you're not being sneaky you know yeah yeah I definitely know all right I'm just down a clean pond uh we gotta develop our pieces now so we gotta do it like this uh put the Rook on the open file that obviously looks quite nice and then maybe I'll kick the queen out of the center with a move like C4 just make sure I'm not you know weakening this too much um Bishop G5 to potentially damage the Pawns plays right into my strategy uh and now you know maybe now I want to bring my queen over to the action I want to play Queen D2 or maybe I want to rotate my Rook for now I think I'm just going to slide forward eyes on the prize uh that's not a bad move maybe we we bust open the center we've got a big lead in development so we can do something like that this bot is playing significantly better than the other ones so I'm I'm mobilizing my forces just like one would in clash and now she blundered upon on the other side of the board uh but you know position is still quite restricted it's it's not over yet uh I gotta find a way to get to this queen maybe I trade Knights maybe I get rid of the Knight that's guarding the king okay uh didn't really budge on that nothing really happening here now I'd like to bring my Rook up and over okay that that that that might be the next game plan here up and over with the Rook gotta be a bit careful how I do it though maybe slide back maybe I think I'm just gonna get rid of the night let's get rid of the night now uh and now we're gonna go up and over and and the thing is for black oh no there it is there what that's just a free but that did not help the case at all but I can still take I don't have to do anything there's no back rank mate because of my Rook and I can just hang out this is not a threat because it's still a pin oh my oh I can take it oh my God I'm taking everything and now when this I have made oh but now I have Bishop takes Goodness Me goodness me and now it's just a ladder mate on the edge of the board all right that was you know it was it was competitive it was definitely competitive for a moment there um but I you know I managed to put it together wizard when he's not pulling rabbits out of hands the wizard is casting huge Fireballs don't don't cast Fireballs on me Wizard all right we gotta we gotta take it serious let's go for the the yield trusty Carl Khan play D4 D5 take take now keep in mind 1900 bot is serious all right this is serious stuff now we are uh we are deep in the weeds here he plays he plays a pan off variation okay Bishop to G5 uh this is definitely one of the lines I'm gonna play Bishop E6 this is this is a very very aggressive line uh and I've got to be careful how I handle this let's play G6 and Bishop G7 okay expected all of this this has all been played before now he's gonna try to expand over here I'm gonna Castle nice and principal chess and when I'm ready here it goes I'm jumping into the middle now I hit this and this the bishop slides back maybe I have Queen A5 maybe I can break the position with B6 right because I'd like to I'd like to damage this stuff over here that's not a bad move maybe a rook C8 I gotta be careful Rook C8 there might be a bishop move how feisty are we feeling should I sacrifice material Bishop A6 okay that's not a good move I think because now I think too many things are opening up whoa what what is going on the Knight is still hanging right but can't I just slide out of the way and now I have a pretty Pleasant position I think right because I'm just going to take I can also play F6 I can attack the Knight and win the pawn which I think is huge oh that was the idea okay I take uh check might be played now I'm just a pawn up right I'm just just the pawn up we have a good position uh I can play F5 I'm targeting the pawn in the center so I have a very very nice position um I guess I can go to an end game should I go to an end game take end game versus a bot let's do it take and maybe I want to protect my seventh rank just like in Clash you know you want to prevent any any invasion of the opponent let's go here we don't want to trade and give up the file so now we have this now my king is going to come forward uh and we should just get a winning position relatively easily uh the bot definitely cannot fight back enough here um we uh I think we have the bot quite dominated here the e-pawn is looking very weak very unstable that's not a bad move it's a little bit annoying actually the way I did this I think I can just take I'm gonna take I'm gonna give up H7 I'm gonna slide back to F6 and then I'm gonna try to infiltrate on C3 this is my big idea let's check see if the king comes forward King did come forward that's mate by the way so now I'm up two Pawns in a rook end game this is relatively straightforward now um I can play A5 for example and the way I'm going to win this is I'm going to advance my that's that's actually a great move that is actually a very good move and a move that I overlooked so I'm gonna have to try to come up with a plan here whoops now if I take there is a check this is what I mean these Bots are resourceful oh my goodness okay let's play A4 kind of messed that up but we're still gonna get it done it's the the chance of of a drawn out is actually much higher than it was before which I am pretty unhappy about but what are you gonna do that's life Rook here we're gonna trade these pawns and a very high probability that this game is still winning for black but now I gotta waste a little bit more time getting there which is kind of annoying this wizard bot is pretty good let's play E4 advancing the pawn as much as we can give a check things probably gotta go backwards whoa king is not going backwards this is definitely wrong yeah because now I just get in the king the king was supposed to stay in front of the pawns the king or with the Pawns uh the way that the bot did it uh now now now I'm just gonna win everything that was definitely not good the Bots end game skills were uh were pretty bad so now I'm just three pawns up and you know I think even Barbarian could win this game G5 G4 we're gonna sneak in with the Pawns in with the king so we're gonna just bring the king bring the pawns there is absolutely nothing white could do we're gonna put White's King on the back Rank and we're just gonna Advance uh we're gonna Advance The Rook can't stay guarding both sets of Pawns Pawn to G3 King F3 E3 and then it's going to be made very very soon uh on the back rank so G2 E2 something like I can I can even go here I can even push upon so get all my pawns together get my king into F3 and that's it it's made very very soon on the back rank something like uh G2 for example Rook F2 even trading the Rooks is an easy win that's probably the easiest way to do this for Max disrespect we will promote another Rook and I'm going to win because I'm going to make a queen and I'm going to win with a queen here here make a queen and uh now you just have to know the fastest way to do this night opposition copycat Knight opposition copycat Bots don't resign because they're annoying but you should also not resign you do this until the king is on the last rank of the board and then you bring your king there we go just don't stalemate very good don't stalemate boop boop boop boop and mate that was tough that was a very tough game I'm expecting the next one to be even tougher Pekka was created for a war but this unfeeling machine of this destruction is a soft spot for tiny butterflies adorable stuff adorable now we get the white pieces versus Pekka I'm going to start with D4 F5 wow okay let's play Pawn to G3 this is the most principled way to play against the Dutch Bishop to G2 we're gonna try to try to have a nice competitive game against Pekka but we're also gonna try to destroy him at all costs you think you can match my strength I don't know I don't know that's what we're about to find out this is one of the best ways to play against the Dutch Pekka is playing the Leningrad and I'm playing this line where you put your knight on on F4 I'm castling now probably Pekka will play this D5 is one of the best ways to play against the Dutch to restrict enemy space uh taking is not so good I think because I get a very powerful uh opportunity to get to the E6 square but remember this is a bot so it's it's gonna play some dumb moves and then it's gonna play some really good moves and that's sort of how Bots play uh Rook C1 preparing The Rook for the C file uh maybe Queen B3 now defense pressure over here that's not a bad move let's slide out of the way now we can also play H3 kick out the Knight uh I think I'm just gonna return to the E3 Square because my Bishop was powerful there and maybe I'll go there in the future now both of my Rooks are in the center and I I have a really Pleasant position here but now I have to figure out how I'm going to move forward so Bishop D4 very slowly inching forward here uh that pawn is looking a little bit soft maybe E4 now bust open the center seems like a pretty good moment now the bot rotated back the other way uh I guess it had an opportunity to to open up the position I'm now laser beaming this diagonal so we're gonna have a very very big tense fight here in a moment typical Clash Style uh Knight takes I think my queen could get taken so let's prepare for that and now I can get in but I think the first thing that I'm gonna do maybe is get in here and attack The Rook that looks really nice Knight on E6 looks really really juicy um and I think I have a winning tactic here I think I can play this followed by this the king takes and then F4 F4 there it is look at that we're gonna beat Pekka this is crazy a huge moment Pawn takes F5 and I'm looking to apply even more pressure with Rook to E1 to take when it's the most opportune for me takes there it is we're beating Pekka my friends Bishop takes E5 we are a clean piece up we just need to protect this at all costs we can go Bishop F1 as well I definitely don't want to throw away this Advantage it would be very very tragic to do so uh Rook to D2 is possible as well so I'm going to slide back for a moment just make sure the Rook doesn't have any moves uh and then I'm looking for Bishop F1 and maybe bishop D3 is The Rook trapped if I play Bishop F1 Bishop D3 not exactly so let me play A3 first I don't want to lose any pawns I want to do this perfectly oh it's getting desperate it just gave up its Rook Pekka on tilt I am a full Rook up put everything on a dark square and run the bishop is helpless against my dark squared control now I put my Rook on E5 and I'm gonna oh this is easy give up The Rook for the bishop and that is game over Pekka has no chance now King to E5 there it goes Bishop to D4 and uh it's just a matter of time until black just simply runs out of moves Pekka's gonna have to dance over here and I am going to or I'm just going to take on E6 here we go here we go it could fight all at once but I'm gonna walk my king over here I'm gonna take on B5 King G5 I'm winning its pawns and Pekka's got no chance I can put my Bishop in the corner I can take on H5 and I can go and Pekka cannot stop me pawn to G5 Pekka's running backwards I'm gonna bring my Bishop all the way back to clear the promotion Square just be careful it doesn't sneak through and obviously just be careful about stalemate you definitely don't want a stalemate here H5 at some point it's gonna try to sneak its Pawn through I'm going to make a queen and I am going to defeat Pekka I I was thinking to make a knight or a bishop but let's just let's just let's just you know do this the right way Pawn to G7 and the easiest way to do this is to get a ladder made two Queens on the board and now we go check we go check and queen to E8 is a mate boom deactivating cess Pekka that was fun pekko was actually that's funny the wizard played better than Pekka played um my friends I have a feeling that for the next video I have to take on the Archer Queen it looks like the entire board is changing uh and I feel like that's that's a video worthy of me playing for a full half an hour totally dedicated let me know if you want me to make a video just playing against the Archer Queen uh it's the Queen's rated 2 900 so you know probably gonna lose but uh we'll do our best this was a lot of fun and I'm looking uh so much forward to uh to The Clash and uh and and the chess collabs that are coming over the next week and if you're watching this in the future this was probably the greatest collab in history except uh except no except for nothing except except for nothing so um enjoy link is in the description if you want to play looking forward to an awesome week of uh clash and chess get out of here
