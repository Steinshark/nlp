ladies and gentlemen welcome back to the candidates Tournament of 2024 this is a double round robin eight player event and the winner will play for the World Chess Championship we have the open candidates and the women's candidates happening at the exact same time for the first time in history and this is round number two out of 14 today there was an earthquake in New York City luckily it was not that big but still it shook the house multiple times and today there was an earthquake in Toronto both literally maybe I don't know but also metaphorically because today's games were absolutely unbelievable and I am going to take you through every single one of them as I always do and uh today vidit gti's name is so long it actually goes off the screen that is a first uh and that's because I added the scores that is generally not part of their name and I am showing you that they both have half out of one point all right here we go friendly reminder for the next couple of days all my courses 33% off just to begin the candidates hikaro opens with E4 we have hikaro versus vided GTI in the first game and then I will show you all the other games because they were all very very fun this one a Spanish all right and vided gate here does not play the main line with A6 Knight F6 he plays the Berlin excuse me this open opening was uh popularized in the year 2000 by Vladimir krck in a world championship match against Gary Kasparov and this is kind of the antidote to the Spanish which is why Karo plays D3 this is very trendy nowadays you do not allow the Knight to take but this is a very committal decision I'm not going to bore you with all the intricacies and the details but the Berlin was supposed to be the antidote to the Spanish the anti- Berlin which doesn't allow black to take this Pawn uh is the antidote to the Berlin Bishop C5 now hikaro plays C3 controlling the center and preparing this move move both sides Castle vidit puts the pawn in the center because that's what you're supposed to do we're going to see another game a little bit later where black plays this move D5 which is a slightly more aggressive way of playing this opening and kind of shows you the way chz branches out into multiple variations as the game progresses D6 H3 and at this point vidit resends the offer of allowing the Knight to be captured and says you know what Hikaru you waited long enough now this bishop will be a target for my pawns and then I'll put the Knight right here all of this has been played before which is why hikaro in this position played the move Pawn to D4 a very natural move if black takes white gets a very healthy Center and a very comfortable Advantage the move d4 has been played some hundreds of times and black here frequently will choose between taking uh but generally retreating the bishop back to the B6 Square which is why it must have been extremely surprising when vidit went here which is literally a move that has never been played before this is what we call a novelty it is a move that has liter I mean it might have been played in like random games at bars but it literally has never been played before ever ever and the idea of this move is that if white takes and black takes and white and white takes another Pawn black will simply put the knights like this and then put the bishop like this and this Pawn it's kind of a liability for white white can't move the Knight out white struggles to move the bishop because of this and in the future black will plant the Knight here and attack it's actually kind of a brilliant little move so Hikaru thinks and plays Bishop D3 spends seven minutes and vidit also doesn't take he loses a pawn in the center what on Earth is vidit doing Karu takes 25 another 20 minutes down the drain not down the drain he's thinking but that's a massive time investment he takes and he grabs the pawn on E5 he doesn't understand what is vid's idea and vidit in this position uncorks the hay maker Bishop takes what did he just completely lost the bishop this was part of his preparation Hikaru now thinks and plays Knight C4 now the idea of this is that if white takes black plays quick Queen B8 and somehow is doing fine I what what is happening white can now play Bishop F4 Bishop C7 bring the bishop back allow this to get captured and go here and that is probably what hikaro should have gone for something like this but this is still a very very very dangerous position so instead of that hikaro plays Knight C4 and he's emerged from the opening down 40 minutes on the clock this is an unbelievable demonstration of preparation by team vided Bishop G4 and now vidid is on his own so he plays Bishop C7 you'll notice he spent 30 minutes generally that is a bad sign and now Karu is probably back in the game Hikaru finds this idea E5 right the best move here for black was to play Knight G6 not worried that this bishop will get taken because you have a lot of activity and black is slightly better because of all the prepar but Bishop C7 is what he played and now Karu grabs himself a Pawn on H7 and forces vid to move and he's caught up on time this is really bad for vidit really really bad and now the best move for white is to play Queen E4 and start fighting back black could play F5 white would play Bishop takes F5 you can't take with anything or else Queen takes here so check on H4 Bishop G5 I mean this is almost impossible to generally play and maybe white will liquidate things and potentially get out of uh but Hikaru comes back with the bishop so you'll notice he spent another 20 minutes and I I think it was just a level of hesitation here because now vidit immediately pounces on the initiative again and he's removing hikaru's control of the center Hikaru comes back vidit takes and Karu must have felt like he needs to he needs to do something like right now like he's got to fight back so he played this move quite quickly he didn't take the Knight which is actually the best move taking he didn't take the Bishop which is the best move after which he would have had to suffer a little bit like he would have been in a in in a worse position but it would have been balanced like worse but maybe manageable in the long run instead he Retreats offering a trade and videt goes here and he is completely winning like just a moment of like autopilot just a bit you know Karo just kind of retreated thought I'm not gonna trade let me go back F5 and Bishop B6 and it's over white is under unbelievable pressure vidit flies in with the Knights puts the king to safety sacrifices a knight Queen goes to G5 gets the Knight back with interest rips open the white position and white has three pieces on their home squares Rook d8 King C1 Knight F1 discovered check and in this position Kikar resigns 29 moves 29 moves but it was winning from move 18 officially but it was like the the preparation Bishop H3 was ridiculous if Hikaru had found all the moves he would have escape the opening and he would have been okay but he goes down with the white pieces to vid GTI who is the first man to win in the candidates this year they drew all their games yesterday but they were 10 games unbelievable result from vidit and uh it's too early in the tournament to start fixing the narratives but I I I thought before the event that of all the three Indians playing Prague probably had the best shot well Brock played gkes in this round which we're going to look at later so crazy stuff great win for vidit hikaro the good thing for hikaro is he's going to have to kind of throw this game in the garbage and if you're a Hikaru fan this is actually kind of the best way to lose because it was a little bit of a of a you know of like a fire like a flame and you throw it in the garbage and you just rely on Preparation and uh and and form for the rest of the event but but but this this is this is hardly the only exciting game we have an all Indian teenager matchup two of the youngest participants of the candidates tournament ever number 14 and number 16 on planet Earth like five rating points away each from being the number one ranked Indian in the world this is legendary stuff th th this is like if we got the this this is like alcaras Center okay like this is the modern day young rivalry D4 D5 and it is a Catalan with Bishop to B4 check all right Bishop G2 is coming from Prague but Prague plays a sideline he gives up the pawn on C4 and this line is one where white wants a big Center and wants the bishop on G2 but he's ready to lose a pawn so he goes here we have Knight C6 this move putting pressure on the White Center disallowing this knight from Easy maneuvering kicks out the bishop takes the center and says hey kukesh you got to defend your Pawn which he does A6 but gkes is out of his prep 10 minutes spent all right Bishop 2 E3 B5 you don't play like this with white if you are trying to be solid you don't do it black now just has a clean extra Pawn but white has a big Center White has more space and white puts the pieces like this and with his 40-minute time Advantage walks directly into the gcash position gukesh captures on D5 and Prague goes for for again Prague goes forward again gukesh goes back to E8 44 minute time Advantage from Prague but he is down two pawns and if you thought two pawns was enough he sacrifices a third East what so ridiculous he straight up gave him three pawns he gave him three Pawns pawns and his idea is to go Knight D4 and just start winning the back one by one Queen here Bishop F4 this this everything in the black Position will collapse this is crazy which is why gesh thought and went F5 gesh spent another 27 minutes on this move if you talk about a psychological advantage I have never seen one like this before 70-minute time Advantage from The Golden Boy I'm talking about Prague like with all the coverage and everything like the the the beating Magnus I mean these Indian teenagers are rock stars and Prague right now has the upper hand on gesh he has spent no time in this opening and he continues to spend no time KES has to play a little bit faster so he puts the Knight on F6 and he's defending himself with his pieces Prague is a pawn two squares away from queening a massive thorman in the white position he plays Queen C2 finally Prague thinks for 40 minutes out of prep on his own he spends 40 minutes thinking and gukesh plays C6 and just says you know what I have this Rock Solid formation prag can take one of his pawns back but now I'm going to I'm going to defend look at this position brick wall absolute unit of a wall Queen E8 brog plays Knight F7 Bishop C8 this type of Defense eighth rank defense defending your opponents roaring initiative coming down to your side of the board this is called kovan playing like anat carpov one of the world champions five out of his eight pieces are are on the back rank Prague is there he is on the one ydd line to make an NFL reference but he can't score the touchdown yet Rook E1 Knight B7 now the Knight is venturing away it doesn't even want to come here it wants to come here or here or maybe here and here so what is the game plan Bishop G5 I mean Prague you if you're if you're Prague in this position you literally cannot have more pressure on your opponent but now you have to do something now you have to do something now you have to make it count so he begins making it count by taking on F6 and sacrificing the bishop oh my goodness this is poker this is like a mix of Poker and chess he he is all in all the chips are in the center of the table he gives away the bishop he takes like this and if you count the material right now prag is down a piece for a pawn and there are threats all over the place Knight C7 E7 Knight to D6 everything is spinning ukes best move slides back one square Prague in this position now has to give up a knight that's the only move apparently Queen G4 check and the idea is Queen D4 sniping The Rook on the other side of the board but instead he goes here trying to set it up and Knight d8 and all of a sudden five of his seven pieces are on the eighth rank seven out of his seven pieces are on the last two ranks but when the dust is settling Prague has nothing Prague has absolutely nothing left five out of six pieces now on the back rank but there's nothing Queen D4 The Rook slides over a square Prague tries to continue to make something happen but he's being pushed back and gukesh in this position lands one strike and the strike that he lands is Rook that was a bishop move Rook takes F2 like this and Prague resigns and gukesh defeats Prague after one of the most absurd defensive games I've ever seen the bishop went to B4 but if we if we exclude that move for a second cuz the bishop went back look at how little moves black made on his opponent's side of the board look look look how few Mo black made nearly no moves in White's territory past the opening I understand upon there that was early look at this this was a master class in dealing with your opponent's momentum look at this he did nothing he literally just removed the pieces and then made one move into his opponent's territory Rook F2 unbelievable defensive game from GES Sublime Sublime game he has one and a half he wins as well vidit and gukesh the early winners of the day I mean just incredible stuff let's pop over to the women's side of things nul salimova I am from Bulgaria leting the only person that lost in the first round seven draws and she was the only person that lost she's the former Challenger for the World Chess Championship uh on the women's side this one a Queens Gambit accepted Knight F3 Knight F6 captures on C4 this is a main line and we get a queenless middle game early I have a feeling Lings yet kind of wanted stability and in this type of game it is white that has to put the pressure the players kind of get intermixed uh and white tries you can take the Rook but then the other Rook is hanging uh but nothing really happens in this one pie slowly come off the board black has a little bit of pressure but those queenside pawns are going to trade off and not a whole lot is going to happen here as we go to a rook and three versus Rook on 3 endgame we have a repetition nurul salimova two draws to start versus Anam musuk and leting not so bad Leia is on the board now another game Katarina lagno versus humpy Connor both Drew in the first game both are also uh Legends I mean absolute Legends by the way we see A6 not a Berlin which is what vidit played this is a main line and now white plays this D3 setup which is a slight sideline and A4 we have Pawn takes Pawn takes a trade and now black takes on A3 it's a big decision giving up the bishop for the knights white gets the bishop pair but black very active in the center of the board Knight to D4 what an idea and here humpy uh with this move Knight D4 playing quite aggressively but instead of taking Katrina can consider this move C4 holding together the center instead of that which looked quite promising she could have claimed some degree of an advantage but black would have obviously had some uh compensation uh instead we have a knight trade in the center of the board and quite quickly literally all the pieces fall off and now it's a queen end game and if anybody's going to win this it's white because of the slightly bad structure but uh and and the outside pass Pawn uh and actually white does get some pretty decent chances but humpy was very accurate with her defense and uh the players end up making a draw and guess what that was the last draw of the round yep the rest of the game somebody lost we had one out of eight decisive results and today we had six so we get the draws out of the way the rest of the game somebody won somebody lost all right Yan pishi Ali Resa Fuji Yan pishi back to back World chess champion Challenger okay backto back winner of the candidates aliv Resa fuja youngest ever player to cross 2800 massive expectations on him I mean really I cannot understate absolutely massive absolutely massive E4 E5 a Spanish a Berlin No Berlin and remember how in the first game of the day I told you that there was uh castles D6 well in this game we have castles and D5 Yan captures on D5 5 the queen comes out and this allows white to kind of take some space on the queen side because that is exactly what black is offering Knight D2 and A4 this has been played many times this type of position where white tries to expand over there black gets active white defends on C2 and now we've sort of left the known Theory Bishop to G4 we see Ali Resa in his preparation Queen A2 from Yan both guys know what they're doing both guys have studied this bishop F3 gf3 Queen takes D3 taking the Free Pawn white defends the free uh the other pawn and queen D7 so Ali Resa at this point out of his prep probably spends 6 minutes comes back Yan is uh down a pawn however this type of approach by white all right giving up the king safety and giving up a pawn he gives up the king and he gives up the pawn but what does he get in return what he gets in return is active Rooks Queen goes to E8 and an attack this is a freaking creative way to play chess H4 and Jan is basically saying you can't cross the middle the defile is lava you can't play F5 which is why Ali Resa brings the Knight back and then plays King h8 look at yan pomi yan pomi middle of the game my man just went H4 H5 H6 dude just straight up sent the pawn in like he didn't touch anything else everything else was beautiful it was like a painting he didn't touch anything else Ali Resa now plays G5 because you can't take because the G file would be open the queen goes to attack the pawn the Knight jumps into to D6 to trade away the Knight Bishop B2 now the engine here is giving black an edge Ali Resa has an advantage and he plays Knight F5 and he plays Knight H4 check he plants the Knight look at can we just look at that Knight's Journey Knight C8 Knight D6 Knight F5 Knight H4 it went for here to here it had multiple stops it had a really terrible flight itinerary but it paid like $8 for the tickets King F1 F5 Ali Reza is better Ali resa is beating nepo with black but the position is very murky very unpleasant Knight to G3 this is another Free Pawn by the way and he takes it aliv resa is now up two pawns meanwhile Yan is still firing away and when this Pawn goes away this is going to get really really unpleasant now F4 giving up the Knight but attacking White's Knight who is weaker the Knight goes into the center that might have been a bad decision by Ali Resa by the way might have been better to control those pieces rather than allowing the knight in Knight A5 now Yan plays this crazy move what is happening Queen goes here I'm I beg your pardon what why did he abandon the bishop it would have been better to go G4 if Bishop takes G4 Knight H2 gets the bishop that would have been better instead Ali gives up the bishop completely and Ali Resa as you can see from the time 35 minutes on the clock here he clearly didn't like something about the move Knight A5 so he went here and all of a sudden he spent 17 minutes and he's down to four gives up the bishop goes Queen to H6 Yan plays Bishop F7 setting up various very nasty intentions over here and also walks the king into the center of the board and that my friends is the last that yanon nishi's King ever felt unsafe in this game again because he was surrounded by the love of his pieces the defense of his pieces and he started eating and his King walked to D3 and that is how a gangster plays chess and yanomi is the king of the candidates Yan pom nishi's King is the king of this game C4 Ali Resa goes completely all in nearly loses on time alza made this move he had N9 seconds to make one move he had like 10 seconds to make three moves by the way he gets to his 40th move a 40th move to get more time but he's just down a rook and a couple of moves later he resigned and Yan pishi goes right back to where he started in 2022 this man just won again he is also in first place along with gukesh and vidit Insanity Insanity every game today had a winner this is Alexander gach whose name also gets cut off on the screen oh my goodness D4 D5 versus Anam musuk we have an exchange slav which is not something that you're used to seeing in a game at like the candidates let's say let's say Bishop F4 this is normally very very boring stuff I mean the position is symmetrical but white plays Knight E5 very edgy move Knight to E5 all right we have Knight takes Pawn takes and here a Gambit E4 that is a complete giveaway of a pawn bishop B5 and then she takes on D7 and plays Knight to a four a seemingly completely innocuous line but muuk clearly uncomfortable overthinks it play thinks for 22 minutes in this position but everything looks playable now you can't play B5 because it's a fork you can't play King C7 either because after Rook C1 you're forced into a corner and you're going to lose it's really unpleasant she plays Rook B8 but somehow there are still many many many threats and unpleasant things in this position and muzichuk just never gets comfortable she tries to give checks white plays Bishop D2 she brings the bishop back the bishop gets kicked out but black can't castle look try you can't why can you not cuz the king moved King moved you can't Castle anymore so the king is sort of dancing in the center of the board and I got news for you the king never makes it out B5 Knight B6 she tries to break out but all of a sudden white just ex just jumps the knight in Rook C7 and that's it Knight takes E7 why is that winning because whatever takes there the bishop will snipe you from the other side of the board and Alexander gachina on the board as well in the women's candidates wins a very very very nice game from start to finish there was a lot of pressure on the black position and it somehow seemed like this Gambit literally just gave up a pawn and forced Black's King into the center of the board that's it I mean black was up a pawn the whole game literally if you count the pawns white has six and black has seven but because black had no way to Castle the material didn't matter and as we got deeper and deeper into the game white just had more white just won this game straight up down upon pawn it was a very impressive Victory Now tandi versus Vali rames Babu tanong the only winner of day one she beat leting and this time we have a jooba London I mean you talk about showing up to the candidates with an edgy chess opening this is a blitz opening at the highest level but it's an imbalan game we have KN C6 we have Bishop D3 and tanong is basically just going to put a knight on E5 and see what's up she's just going to build up her position in a way that she's going to attack the center all right Bishop D6 good Bishop middle game two players that hate Bishops A3 solid right nobody's going to B4 Knight A2 wow the idea of Knight A2 is to potentially put the Knight there but also to maybe put the Knight where the queen is and then jump into the position Rook C8 C3 just very solid game very Solid V sh puts the knight in the center the queen slides out of the way the Knight goes to B4 and the Knight goes to D3 it's exactly what you want it's this beautiful harmonious game black trying to do stuff over here white trying to put something into the center and she does and I told you this is what she's going to do F3 Knight back to D6 Knight F4 okay I mean is there something Brewing I I don't think there's an attack Brewing okay white is kind of trying but certainly nothing is going to happen right I don't see any way to what is t e doing I mean she just overconfident from the previous game with Knight B5 Vali is but here's a better question what is Vali doing her Knights are not going to eat rocks horses don't eat rocks right I don't think they do but uh Queen H4 Knight H5 and tendong E is just a locomotive just completely Unleashed she's going down the G file Rook is on G2 Knight is on F4 Pawn is on E5 Knight to F6 absolutely gangster final move disconnecting everything that's mate and if you take it goes from bad to worse the other Knight jumps in the King has to go to the G file and when it does I take and then I take like this and I win both Rooks an absolute Avalanche tantoni rendered Black's position completely useless like a a fantastic game and she has two wins out of two games she's 2 and0 what a game this was I mean this was like Smooth this was smooth like butter she set up in a way that black had absolutely nothing there was nothing that black could do against White's setup white played it slowly and when it came time went so quick and so fast it was done like a boxer just just boom boom it was over two for two last game of the day Fabiano Carana after drawing yesterday versus Hikaru njata basov after drawing yesterday versus Yan pishi shows up plays a Sicilian Defense and against Fabiano's Rosal liimo he plays E5 that's crazy I mean you talk about surprising a guy in a sicilian E5 is one of the least popular moves in that position you can play D6 E6 G6 so many things E5 has been and Fabiano what he does in this game I mean I mean look I mean look at this this is wild stuff some of you may be wondering by the way why you can't take and take it's because black would play Queen D4 that's that's why so white can't just win the pawn black goes here D3 and Fabby here just says you know what let's just play chess play chess H3 and when you attack me since you're not jumping right you're not going to get out of the way I'm gonna take takes Knight H4 so the idea by white is to put a bunch of Pawns on light squares he traded a light Square Bishop so he gets the he gets the pieces out of the way Knight H4 the idea of Knight H4 quite straightforward F4 in the future Queen F3 light squares white is going to play on the light squares abasa plays Rook E8 Queen F3 G6 okay that's a big decision G6 you can't go to F5 Bishop G5 from Fabiano and queen E3 so Fabby taking control of the dark squares and the light squares in this position abasov plays Knight H5 all right Fabby has to trade the bishop and he brings the Knight back to F3 and essentially what Fab is saying in this position is the guy that controls the pawn breaks has the advantage Black's got a very solid formation but black is never going to play F5 for example like Fabby went here black is never going to go here because it just opens up possibilities for white this a horrible trade so the guy that controls the pawn breaks has the advantage now abasov plays B5 here after spending 8 minutes and that weakens the C5 Pawn so now Fabiano this is so instructive what fabbi does here he brings one Knight back he brings two knights back and sometimes in life you got to take a step back to go two steps forwards well Fabiano takes two steps back so that means by the law of mathematics which I just invented means he's going to go four steps forwards F4 I told you about this move a long time ago remember a long time ago I said Knight H4 preparing various f- Pawn advancements well it took fabon a little while to figure out and bite his time but there it is all right now we trade and he's got a line of attack all right this game has been smooth sailing so far from Fabby he's now going to have to deal with the counterplay look at this look at this idea by the way B4 what an idea the point is to split up the pawns so that after the trade these guys are frozen you can't take because the queen would be walking away from the defense of the king E5 is vicious smacked here smacked here bad news that's why abasov tries to get rid of his weakness but Pawn takes and abasov here should probably take the pawn back fast he didn't like something I think he didn't like the queen getting into B6 which is why he does this but Fai now just doesn't give up the pawn that was a massive decision from abasov E5 Fabi continuing to hammer away in the center of the board you may be wondering why there was no capture because after take take Queen E3 too many weaknesses Queen D6 Knight E4 and you lose so F5 abasov says I don't want to trade Fabiano says you're going to trade the pieces because I'm up a pawn I need to get to my Pawn but abasov is defending himself very well Rook A8 Knight B3 now abasov goes nuts he starts counterattacking with the Pawns in front of his King but it turns out to be the best moves Rook F2 giving up the pawn on C4 but getting the pawn back on F5 it's a very tense game but abasov makes a fatal mistake what he should have done is he should have played Queen to E6 and after Rook F6 he should have just stepped forward but he panics a little bit and he takes the Knight thinking he's winning a pawn back but after Rook F1 it's over you cannot stop Rook F7 check maybe abasov thought somehow he was in time but this is a check if it wasn't a check like if the position was um this yeah Rook A1 is a great move because you're going to trade but because Rook F1 comes with a check it all falls apart and Fabiano Carana wins his first game of the candidates Fabiano Carana Yan pishi gukesh and vidit are tied for first with one and a half points these are your final standings on both sides tan everybody's on the board on the open side we got four guys that won and we got four guys that lost all right the women's side we have two winners in this round and one of them is a double winner from round one she's at two points and the only person even close to her is Alexandra gkin a nearly a one-point lead there already round number three is tomorrow incredible matchups a wait I'm having a great time get a course for 33% off while you can get out of here
