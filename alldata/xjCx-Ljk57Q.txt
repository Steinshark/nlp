is it num or numpy this is a debate I started over the internet not even intentionally how to pronounce the numpy numy python Library package and the reason this all started was I was sharing in a little clip on social media about what I learned in my recent machine learning class which included the nump we'll go with that the nump uh Library used for python anyways leave down in the comments how do you pronounce it and what what do you think is the right way in this video we are not going to be debating fully on what how to pronounce numpy or numpy but rather I want to share with you exactly what I've been learning in my machine learning course now this is a course that or a program that is a year-long I'm taking at George Brown College and the first course of the entire program is machine learning one so we are starting from the foundation of machine learning and building our way up this course is a mixture of Hands-On work and then also to business theoretical work so I really love it as a side note I got some comments being like Tiff are you switching careers into data science or data becoming a data analyst no not by any means but I do see AI being something that is going to continue to impact our daily lives our careers and I want to understand exactly how it works how does machine learning work how does artificial intelligence work this is something I'm as a builder at heart as a coder at heart I always want to understand how things actually work so that's kind of the background as to why I decided to take this course and I love learning in a group setting so that's another reason why I did it instead of doing online which I've for about the past year on my own time speaking of online courses I'm going to share with you some of the top machine learning courses that you can take online if you're interested in exploring more of this but I thought this was a really great way to connect with you and for anyone who's either interested in machine learning just wants to get some high level of it or if you are studying it we can do it together speaking of AI and machine learning though something you need a portfolio when you are going to be putting all your learnings in one spot a portfolio or even an aspect to your portfolio or website a Blog where you can share about this now I'm not saying you have to become you know an influencer or share your daily life on this website or portfolio but I do think having a place to put your learnings and projects You're Building will help you stand out so what I've been using to build my portfolio my updated one is a tool called 10 web now I'll pull it up on screen here so 10 web has an AI website builder which allows you to go through a website creation flow all right so you can see here I am on 10 web's website and we are going to generate a website so this is really cool I love there are two options one being convert a website to Wordpress with AI for this example though let's create a website with AI and this will generate tailored content and images all right so create an informational website or an online store this is super cool for anyone looking to sell anything like I said earlier but let's go informational business type let's start with let's do tech company we're all about the tech you know and this also would work for a portfolio if you are in Tech as well all right this is super helpful to me because I am someone who does not have an eye for design at all I actually really like this one I think this is a really great way actually this might be the best no this one let's go with this one for the portfolio and let's do Forest I love that green next company name let's do Tiffany Tech next now service feature now see this is really cool so obviously you want to blog uh latest advancements latest tech advancements Innovative you know we got to really lean into the tech all right we are in the generating our personalized AI website this is super exciting I always get excited to see how AI interprets what I'm looking to to build all right here is the website I mean not going to lie it so blows my mind that this is generated in a matter of seconds you can see here it is responsive so let's go into Mobile and there you are voila it's beautiful okay but I want to show you something really cool this yes it generated an incredible site for us but there is so much more that we can do with it so one thing I just want to scroll down though because you can see here you can even subscribe to a newsletter which is incredible okay but I wanted to share with you all the different tooling and customization you can add to it let's go ahead and do so for say a video and then from there what you can do is link it to say a YouTube video uh do autoplay mute I mean the options are endless this is just so cool and then also too I really love the 10 web premium widgets so things such as the pricing table price list this is more so when you get into wanting to freelance or create a Business website this comes in handy major I linked 10 web down below so make sure to go check it out I gave the example of using it for a portfolio but this is great if you are looking to start a business uh maybe you want to do some freelancing and have some online services this is where to go all right let's get back into what did I learn my first 2 weeks in machine learning learning and why should you care well one as I mentioned having this understanding even through this video will really help you as to even if you're not a technical person just understanding some common terms that are used within machine learning so the first thing we did day one of the course is we installed something called Anaconda and I'll bring it up on screen here now when I was installing Anaconda one thing it reminded me of is npm so it's kind of like maybe that's a wrong wrong example but that's what it really reminded me of it was almost like a package manager so you can see all the different kind of packages libraries and things you want to install now on day one one of the things that we went ahead and installed was Jupiter notebook and this is something that we are using pretty much on a daily basis or every single class and this is uh I mean how they describe it is a web-based interactive Computing notebook environment so essentially you can edit and run uh docs that are more userfriendly it feels they say human readable because we like to interact with computers as humans that doesn't make sense but you get what I mean anyways it's a really great application and you also can access Anaconda through your terminal once you have it installed by just prompting with cond so it's very user friendly okay and another thing we learned which I think is so key and important for you to understand is the difference between supervised unsupervised and reinforcement learning now these I found this really interesting because I like to equate things to real world examples and the way that the data is trained through these different types of learning you can really do that you can relate it back to real world examples so let's go through some of this cuz this is key to know supervised learning supervised learning was the easiest one for me to wrap my head around and that essentially is you are already uh labeling the data as you are teaching machine about it so when the data is coming in it say it's Apple the data that is Apple is already labeled as so so the machine once it gets it it already knows what an apple is so an example of this is when we were kids and we were studying uh through textbooks you know the questions are in the front of the textbook and then at the back would be the answers that's kind of how you can think of super supervised learning then we have unsupervised learning which really involves working with data that has not been labeled yet so why would you do this this is something that took me a bit to understand and it's really in the case that you just weren't able to label the data ahead of time so an example would be customer segmentation so say you are tracking different areas about your customers uh say their demographic their habits their spending all that kind of thing but you weren't labeling this data so what you can do with unsupervised learning is through different uh Tech techniques such as clustering the company can then group these customers into segments based on similarities then we have reinforcement learning this one honestly is something that's still hard for me to wrap my head around as far as what is the difference between like why you would use reinforcement learning instead of supervised or unsupervised learning like I said I'm still learning and I'm just sharing with you my learnings and I want to be always real and candid with you about that so for reinforcement learning how I look at it as I mean I have to always equate things to dogs I mean CU they're the best when you you are giving when you are training a new dog or a dog for a new trick there is kind of reinforcement learning that they do so it's either if they do the trick right they get a treat if they do it wrong they have to try again and that's essentially what reinforcement learning is literally where it's the machine is getting fed data and then if it's able to identify different data yes it gets rewarded this is correct and if not try again so an example that reinforcement is actually used is with self-driving cars so the car system could receive rewards for desirable action such such as maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles staying in the correct Lane Etc and then penalties if it does not do the correct action I mean that could be big penalties but you get the point and then over time it will get smarter and smarter Honestly though one of the biggest takeaways even just from two weeks of this course we're really going to start diving more into data structures and algorithms in week three but what I've learned thus far is I used to think of people who studied AI or machine learning as these Geniuses kind of similar to what I used to think when when I was first getting into coding and software development I thought there's no way I could ever study that or there's no way I could ever get a job doing that etc etc when in reality when you dive into it I I've noticed I've had a lot of the same feelings I did when I first started to code as I do now that I'm getting into machine learning where it's feels overwhelming and you feel kind of silly or dumb honestly at times but then you realize that that's part of the learning process and everyone has been here having those feelings you just keep on going and learning that is the key to it that is the key to success with anything you are learning and I wanted to share that because I think I I'm I'm hoping that I'm not alone in these feelings or maybe I hope I am alone so then you don't feel this way but at the end of the day it's normal to have these feelings of impostor syndrome but just keep on going and know it's not unique to you others feel this way too with that though let's dive into some courses if you want to have more of a self-paced learning when it comes to these topics and once again it doesn't mean that you necessarily want to switch your career but it's more so you're very interested in this and you want to be educated to continue to grow in your career or skill set let's start with some free resources because we love free resources so one is machine learning crash course and this is for Google developers or by Google developers so this is a quick intro to machine learning and it really is pretty high level touching on Concepts and then also two tensorflow examples so it does get a bit more into the weeds but this I would say is a good course if you are a technical person but wanting to touch uh machine learning just on a higher level okay and then Kel has some great courses or micro courses they're called and I mean they are known for its competitions they offer micro courses on specific machine learning topics so these include intro to machine learning and intermediate machine learning courses which are very Hands-On now if you don't want to do a Hands-On course there's a great one I would recommend by corera I mean corera honestly is just killing it right now with different machine learning nii courses and this one is machine learning uh by Stanford University I've shared with this one before but it is so good and I think it's a great one whether you are technical or non-technical to dive into but it's not free that one but it's really worth it I took the AI version of this course learning about artificial intelligence I haven't taken the machine learning one yet and that course anyways was done so well it really laid a good foundation for me anyway so I definitely check that out all right I hope you enjoyed this I'm curious do you want me to share more about what I'm learning in my machine learning class what questions do you have around it leave in the comments I always do my best to try and answer every single one of your comments and also too I linked down below 10 web so you can get building with AI building your portfolio building your business today oh and if you haven't already hit
