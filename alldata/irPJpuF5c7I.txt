ladies and gentlemen yesterday we got it again Hikaru and Magnus if you've been a fan of chess for a long time or you've been a fan of chess for I don't know 30 minutes you've got to know these two these are by far the two most popular individuals uh who play competitive chess all right in the Chess World and anytime they get to play against each other tens if not hundreds of thousands of people tune in to watch like just look at the view count on this video well maybe don't look at the view count on this video in the first 10 minutes it's gonna be low but in like a day uh and they were in the losers bracket uh there's currently a tournament going on an online event it's called The Chess Bowl Masters and they were both uh knocked out of the winners bracket Magnus earlier than Hikaru so they had to play a best of two how do you play a best of two well in chess you play a game you play another game and then if it's one to one you play what we like to call armaged here's Hikaru and Magnus uh both as the losers and uh here we go and this match had an insane ending insane ending which resulted in uh well some theatrics so E4 and God I mean God bless this man Magnus for pulling up with a Carl Khan I mean are you kidding me a Karo Khan thank you Magnus now kikaru here plays a meta line which has gotten very popular recently at the high level of the game it's Knight F3 D5 and now it's not taking it's not pushing and it's also not playing the two knights Cairo which is very formidable opening but rather it's this move D3 this is a ridiculous top computer idea and uh the point is that essentially if black doesn't take if black plays like G6 then white will play into this Caro structure which is considered better for white uh and if black does take on e4 and white does lose the right to Castle which is completely what white is inviting essentially this Pawn gets in the way of this Knight and therefore uh and therefore White's position is more pleasant okay now sometimes people lay Bishop G4 here and then you know they take and they play E5 and Knight D7 and Bishop D6 and like and black is very solid but uh this is essentially what they went for like Hikaru played this line and Magnus took and said all right no queens you lose the right to Castle uh then he played Knight F6 attacking the pawn on e4 and Hikaru played Knight bd2 and here Magnus played this move G6 okay now there's a lot of things that can happen from this position uh White can play and by the way you should not trust the computer evaluation uh on a high depth it thinks that uh there is still much more chess to be played um again black cannot put the Knight on C6 so now kikaru actually undevelops his Knight which is like a completely fascinating move uh that white can do that and and the point of undeveloping is that he wants to play F3 F3 will block this Knight's activity and it will also stop this Bishop from getting developed naturally and that's exactly what Hikaru does now this actually is kind of annoying for black and look at the evaluation so Magnus plays G6 Hikaru plays 91 and just a few moments ago the computer was trying to say black is better now the computer is saying white is better all right so the computer just doesn't understand the opening it just doesn't know how to analyze uh an opening position but like if you just talk about the natural future development yeah black is sort of in his own way so Magnus puts the bishop in front of the e-pawn and Hikaru plays B3 with a very clear idea of putting the bishop here and maybe in the future uh putting something on C4 so Magnus castles Bishop B2 and okay now the computer seems to think that black is the one that's better right like uh I mean it's it's crazy uh maybe instead of B3 uh it wanted Knight B3 Bishop C1 King C1 and it wanted white to put the Knight on D4 that's what the computer wants uh but it's a fascinating position right like Rook d8 you block you know you block the uh the PIN and it's uh it's a complex position now Magnus plays this move C5 okay you cannot take this Pawn because you would lose the Knight and the other benefit of C5 is that now I'm gonna play Knight C6 and I can always play B6 if I need so my position is very very pleasant and actually Magnus I think has gotten the better of the opening even though he is a bit restricted by white structure so Hikaru plays F4 Magnus plays Knight C6 and Hikaru plays G3 and and apparently like black is a lot better here uh if he plays Knight G4 for example alright if he tries to get in with his Knight obviously he didn't play Knight G4 because I imagine he thought that Hikaru just goes King E2 then there might be an id4 check take take and uh I guess Magnus just didn't like he didn't think that this was a big enough advantage and he thought White's structure was was nice and solid instead of doing it with Knight G4 uh Magnus plays C4 which is a sacrifice of a punt C4 is just a giveaway completely of a pawn uh and he didn't have to do that he could have apparently prevented that first uh well prepared that first by playing the move B6 but he sacrifices the pawn if Hikaru does this he's gonna lose this Pawn so he takes with the B Pawn and the Knight on D2 now protects everything and he's just the pawn up but why is he still worse why is Hikaru still worse it's because Magnus is going to play Knight A5 and it's uh shockingly difficult to keep the spawn protected uh in fact it's probably just impossible if you move the Knight to defend this you re-pin yourself I come here and now you're in big trouble so Hikaru either has to try to move the pawn out of the way and let the knight in or start complicating matters so first you play Z5 and Hikaru wins Hikaru wins the game here not of Chess but he wins uh Connect Four uh so uh yeah congrats to the Hikaru Knight D7 so temporarily blocking and now kikaru plays C5 so the pawn is kind of temporarily evaded danger uh maybe hikar will play Bishop G2 maybe he'll put a rook on the B file Magnus is still trying to win the pawn back Hikaru is like no you can't have my Pawn now at this point if Magnus has stays a little bit more patient brings the Knight back and then plays B6 computer is claiming he actually has a very big Advantage the computer is claiming that after something like B6 uh C takes B6 Knight takes B6 like the pressure is very good Magnus plays B6 first okay he plays B6 First Take take but the difference is that his Knight never actually made it back and Hikaru can take the Knight on B6 first sikaru goes here and then he takes the Knight on B6 but he should have just taken the Knight on B6 the point is that despite all of magnus's best efforts at staring straight down into hikaru's position of course this bishop doesn't have X-ray vision but it's still lurking uh even though it looks like a Black's position can make White's position very dangerous it's not so simple and so Knight C4 and now kikaru is up two bonds and still apparently the computer after F6 thinks that black has enough time to break out hitting this getting the bishop back or even playing G5 and just Wreck It Ralph but unfortunately yeah Magnus plays Rook A4 and tries to be a little bit more solid rotates the bishop around uh but Hikaru as always gets himself into a defensive situation where uh his opponent cannot crack the armor Bishop D4 and uh Magnus does win back one of the pawns but we are now in an opposite colored Bishop end game and in this position Hikaru just offered a draw and Magnus accepted he accepted because opposite color Bishop end game yes you are going to win one of these pawns uh you might even win both of these pawns but uh this is just the draw uh this position is not winnable uh but actually I don't even think you're gonna win both of the bonds but yes this Pawn will get to B6 and this is a draw okay they drew one game all right they drew a game what happens when they play White well we have D4 from Magnus we have a nimso Indian remember this is game two the winner of this game uh either wins and goes back to the winners bracket or this is going to be an Armageddon uh so we have Bishop D2 which is some trendy line trying to do this and Hikaru plays Knight E4 he just goes straight for the bishop all right straight for the bishop Knight E2 B6 and now D5 we're in a very very offbeat uh nimso and we're in a very offbeat nimso where Magnus now plays H4 this is scary anytime you get hit with H4 in basically any position at the Grand Master Level you know a guy prepared it now granted Magnus spent like four minutes on this move so uh probably this was not preparation uh but it was kind of maybe some deep surprise weapon or a bluff so we have Ed Queen D5 which attacks the rook and Hikaru plays Knight C6 Rook D1 and now his age Pawn is Frozen the thing is about playing the move H4 H5 is like you gotta have something you know uh and Hikaru very quickly uh gets the full momentum going and gives up the pawn on D7 and Magnus has to take it he has to take it because he's congested he can't move anything if he plays the move F3 to try to kick the Knight out I just come back this is a weakness if you try to play the movie four I'm gonna play 95 like I can even sack on e4 in the future so Hikaru basically gives up the pawn on D7 and he causes uh total pandemonium here with Knight D4 Knight D4 disconnects The Rook from the Queen the queen is now hanging uh if you play Queen E7 I actually mate you like I just straight up met you like the game ends so it's a very confusing move if you take with the bishop of the Paw and I take the queen for free so you have to take with the rook and after CD4 Queen E7 rookie 7 Bishop D4 material is equal white has a dark scored bishop and two pawns for a rook black has Five Pawns white has seven Bishop Plus Pawn Plus Pawn is five Rook is five five is five you're welcome uh Rook C8 Knight F4 and F3 Knight takes and actually it was Hikaru who was better I mean both guys getting the better of one another with the black pieces look at that and uh yeah Magnus has to play King F2 and put his King on G3 now what is one thing that is holding together magnus's position is this bishop I mean this bishop is hanging on to everything and therefore everything is defended in fact everything in the white position is well protected uh and uh the computer does think that black has some sizable Advantage but for example Rook D7 and uh you know Magnus plays A5 and there's just not it it's gonna be a Monumental effort to win this position so Hikaru just doesn't he just plays Rook C8 and offers a drop just straight up offers a draw he's like minus point three we have Armageddon now how does Armageddon work Armageddon is like this both players bid they blind bid they say I want black in Armageddon and I will I am willing to start with this amount of time against 15 minutes okay uh no bonus time the reason they want black in the Armageddon is because if the game is drawn black wins so essentially black is playing for two results a win and a draw which is massive uh but in order to get the black pieces which is an advantage uh you need to give up some time and they don't know how much time they're going to give up and remember there was the soul read from Magnus which was bidding one second less than Hikaru this time Hikaru wins he bet he bids 9 minutes and 17 seconds Magnus bids 9 minutes and 27 seconds and um Hikaru has the black pieces and as you can see it is 15 minutes to nine that is a big advantage it's a very very big advantage of time um so Knight C3 and we have a Four Knights four nights English we don't have a four nights King's Pawn um now here white can play G3 he white can play G3 E3 E4 D3 D4 and A3 I have seen every single one of these moves played Magnus plays the most forcing move which is D4 this is not a way to get an advantage but it's certainly a surprise weapon take take Hikaru develops the bishop to B4 and he is going to Castle as well Magnus puts the bishop on G2 and you'll notice that Hikaru is not rushing he is completely like he's just developing all of his pieces uh castles and now we have our first moment of the game I mean at this point I would probably take because the the bishop is no longer pitting anything but Hikaru doesn't he plays H6 uh H6 after played after 27 seconds of thought prevents white from playing the move Bishop G5 but what it does enable is white playing Knight T5 so essentially kikaru is saying I don't need to take this Knight because that is what Magnus wants me to do he wants me to take he wants to allow me you know get the bishop out and then if I play H6 I've already given up my Bishops and now he can just go here so I'm gonna play H6 he could play Knight D5 I'm gonna defend my position I'm gonna trade the Knight and I'm gonna trade the second night he calms down seven minutes I mean this is this is crazy all right he's down seven minutes now he has to defend his Bishop Bishop B3 Cuts away Bishop C5 Bishop back to D6 this is this is unpleasant Rook fd1 all right B6 looking to get Bishop C5 Queen slides out of the way now there is no Bishop C5 rookie C1 is coming and from the opening stage it was Magnus with the advantage and he grows down six minutes on the clock I mean this position is really bad because you're just gonna go here the guy can't take on E2 because of rookie one then he takes with check and then he wins back the queen so what do you do like really how do you defend this position you move your Bishop somewhere C7 is weak C7 Falls all of this Falls Hikaru plays Bishop A6 all right defending his position now Magnus plays E4 which is the best move Hikaru takes on F4 which is close to the best move now Magnus can create an imbalance here and open up potentially g-file ideas but he just takes with the queen folks he's up five minutes and 40 seconds Hikaru has five minutes and he's much worse his C7 Pawn frail D6 an idea he has to go D6 himself and basically hope Magnus does not just completely ravage this Magnus plays Rook C3 Hikaru plays Queen d8 Rook C1 rookie seven Conjuring up some defensive formation Magnus H4 Magnus is just playing the top line of the computer like every single move and he's able to do that because his position is so easy the fact that Hikaru even found this defensive configuration is ridiculous the reason it's impressive is he cannot play Rook C8 cannot play Rook C8 because at any given moment this is gonna happen and you know then the attack is going to come in so hikaru's got absolutely no moves and he's down six minutes and he has no bonus time his time is just ticking so he plays Bishop B5 he doesn't know what to do it's an absolute carte blanche for Magnus he could do whatever he wants in this position he's just going to March Hikaru down Hikaru is like the fighter who who's got like a like a like like a hurt body from body punches he his leg is compromised he's just sitting but he's not done all right he's not done and Magnus is walking him down in the ring he's got to put him away all right he's got to put him away or or I'll see Carl's gonna find a way back so Magnus plays G4 Hikaru F6 covering up I mean look at this every Pawn in a dark Square you cannot find an uglier position but he's not losing he's not losing yet G5 Here Comes Magnus knocking on the door probably the right decision Hikaru takes takes and now plays Rook F7 attacking the queen and you know what Hikaru does he just takes the pawn he just takes the point he's got four minutes on the clock against ten and he's worse Bishop H3 coming into E6 how are you gonna defend this position he can't replace Bishop D7 he blocks the light squared Bishop from coming into H3 but now he unguards C7 I've been talking about that pawn folks if that pawn Falls the entire Integrity of the black position disintegrates but Hikaru was going to trade off a bishop Rook F7 King F7 Queen H3 it's now a queen and Rook end game but Hikaru has a terrible d-pawn doubled g-pawns a wide open King sleeping with an open window and there's mosquitoes outside The Rook controls the open file this Rook stares into nothing this queen stares into nothing and he's down five and a half minutes on the clock I mean like this is a worse nightmare situation Hikaru Queen F6 Magnus Queen H7 an idea that Hikaru afterwards said that he had missed he had overlooked Queen H7 infiltrating and he's he's much worse he now plays Rook f8 after 30 seconds of thought he has four minutes remaining on the clock Rook E7 check King E8 back to the home Square oh but wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute it's not so easy here in fact turns out after Queen H7 Rook f8 was the only move it was the only move that did not lose if Hikaru has not found this Rook f8 idea to untangle and counter-attack he would have lost why because you cannot defend the king any other way if you try to play passively Queen hate his mates if you try to trade the Rooks I'm gonna check you a million times and honestly I wouldn't be surprised if the king and pawn end game is completely lost and also I don't even have to play King and pawn end game Rook f8 is a brilliant defensive configuration Magnus gives a check King E7 and now trades into a queen end game Hikaru has now closed the gap of time to a minute and a half folks a few moves ago it was ten four and a half and it seemed like a four-gun conclusion that after Queen F6 Queen H7 that was it Rook f8 was brilliant he Magnus had to like sack up I mean the computer here is trying to show some obscure absurd lines Rook f8 is so clutch you give it a few moves we're now in a queen end game and Magnus make no mistake Magnus is still the one asking the questions but look at the time it's a minute it's it's it's it's our 40 second time Gap from six minutes King F6 A4 King F3 King E3 but Hikaru has no pawn moves Hikaru literally cannot move any pawn Magnus can still move the f-pawn and just so you understand like it's always a question of does trading like this win for white does it lose for white in this case you allow Hikaru to have the G Pawn but if the King was here this would be winning for white probably because he would get the king to G5 like it's a massive question constantly of would you trade and win King D3 Queen G3 oh my goodness it's down to 30 seconds it the time is even the time is even folks the time is even this is completely insane Queen D4 Queen D6 Hikaru activates looking for Perpetual check but there is no Perpetual check so Hikaru plays Queen D4 he does not take the pawn because then Queen C6 would force the king away and maybe white is just make making a queen so Queen D4 threatening him threatening a Perpetual in the corner in fact it's made it's made in the corner so King A2 Queen D2 looking for Perpetual check check Queen back to C1 oh my goodness G4 from Hikaru Queenie one can be King B Magnus is winning again 49 seconds on the clock this is winning for Magnus if he plays King A2 with the idea in this position basically if he the shuffling continues now the king is a square away E5 E6 Queen goes back E7 and that's it you just enter with the queen and you're gonna win Magnus in this position had to just stay patient for a move play King A2 why King A2 why do you have to go here if this King comes closer you have check and you get in so King A2 is a ridiculous two swung but Magnus rushes with E5 Queen D5 only defensive move and now there's a check a very timely check and hikaru's still back to the wall 30 seconds on the clock oh my goodness this is completely insane there is no bonus time check here check the king the queen blocks Magnus in this position after King C7 he probably had to start running his King forward but all of these pawns are so weak Queen E5 queenies Queen G7 King C6 Queen G6 check there's no checks 15 seconds on the clock for kikaru and 27 for Magnus and now disaster strikes Agnes plays E7 check ing E7 with the idea of Queen takes B6 this would lead to a position where this is hanging and this is protected now it's still a draw but Hikaru would have probably had to go here and pray essentially that he is getting Perpetual otherwise Magnus is going to give checks 10 seconds up in this position probably white wins never count Hikaru out in a bullet game but instead of that after King takes E7 Magnus went for Queen takes B6 and mouse slipped this up 10 seconds on the clock 60 moves into the Armageddon game Magnus plays Queen F6 check blundering the queen by Mouse lip and resign the game also screamed and expletive because who wouldn't and Hikaru wins the Armageddon of the finale of the losers bracket qualifies back to the Grand Final and now he's lost already one time to Fabiano so he would need to beat him and then beat him again but oh my goodness oh my goodness there was 70 000 people tuning into this and queen F6 is is tragic and you know before I sign off this video before you click I'm curious I saw a lot of people mad they were very mad about this queen F6 move they were like this is why online chess will never surpass live over the board play I don't know why they're British for their complaint but you know people people are very upset by this um they were like this kills the Integrity of the game and um how can you win like this and uh all this stuff and I see their point I see you know I get it I get it of course because technically when you play online in low time and all this the quality is going to be decreased but I got to tell you I feel like the fans entertainment oh my goodness uh it's gonna be much higher um but yeah such is life such as life people were upset by this for sure um but uh that's okay that's okay Hikaru knocked out Magnus by mouth slip and it was brutal now get out of here
