tell you early zillow holders very happy very happy with what's been going on without further ado though let's get into our our little investigation here into sort of the laughing stock of the internet lately which is aiden ross let's go to the board i'll explain ladies and gentlemen welcome to the 10 million studio i'm your host coffee zilla and of course we're talking about aiden ross popular twitch streamer one of the the biggest right now and he got in hot water recently after promoting a token called milf token i wasn't able to talk about it at the time because i was doing the save the kids stuff but i want to revisit it a little bit because he's been lying to the internet about his scam saying it wasn't a scam no one got hurt and that's a complete lie he lied to h3h3 he lied to hassan well it depends actually how you look at it he might have um you you might say he's too dumb to understand what he really did so that's the two options actually that's the real two options he either maliciously lied or he's accidentally lying because he doesn't understand how crypto scams work let's find out together you guys tell me what you think do you think this was a malicious lie or a purposeful one let's check it out all right bringing down the board uh we got aidan ross here this was the stream that sparked it all he said that he was gonna on may uh 26th i believe he said he was going to be buying milf token this is a paid endorsement um but uh yeah let me uh let me go ahead and buy let me buy a milf real quick i want to buy one um he spends the next like 15 to 30 minutes trying to figure out how uniswap works and he's on the phone with what sounds like jordan galen guys if you guys remember him from the save the kids investigation now it's important to note that aiden ross looks like he got paid around 186 000 this was a payment to jordan galen who helped aiden ross facilitate this whole transaction we know that he was running deals for a lot of these guys so about two hundred thousand dollars was paid to aiden ross and people understandably were upset when later aiden said he basically knew it was a scam by the way that milk token did a while back i already told you guys don't buy that i got paid a bag do that like i don't give up how many guys actually bought it i hope none of you guys actually bought the scamp token that i promoted hashtag not financial advice hashtag life of an influencer aiden ross hashtag w so anyways he goes on to be confronted about it this is all an old news to some of you we're just catching you up because i'm gonna show you how he's been lying um he gets he gets called out by h3h3 and hassan they get him on a call and they confront him about these facts it wasn't a pump and dump i wanted to show you this clip from my live stream this is my promo i just want to say real quick they wish that they never did this with me let me just show you why i'm so his response is they wish they had never done it with me guys because look i said i'm not a financial advisor i said i'm getting paid for this therefore they wish they had never done it it couldn't have been a pump and dump which that's fine but then the lie comes when he says this they wish they never doubted me right so because like they were just like what the hell was that so let's see like if i was a brand and i paid somebody to do that i just did it horribly i didn't know what i was doing i did the scam horribly i didn't promote it right so therefore it wasn't a scam and this is the whole framing he sets up dude it was a bad promo they wish they had never done it with me it couldn't have been a scam because of that and he harps on this over and over and over for why he's innocent you know my like i just want people to understand like it was a really really bad promo that's what makes him innocent the fact that hey because it's a bad promo clearly no one bought in and he continues this thought later i saw it yeah in the beginning hassan you you pay attention to all analytics you i know you were on that i used to watch you when back when the election was going on bro you pay attention to every statistic at every minute of the day you saw that after that it went down so listen it was not a scam of pumping up nothing that's the reason it wasn't a scam guys because the price went down after he promoted it in other words had people lost money it would have been a scam it would have been a pump and dump but because the price went down it wasn't a pump and dump now this is where the key lie is guys we're not going to let them get away with this because this is the biggest lie influencers love to harp on they love to defend themselves they go hey the price the price didn't spike and then dump it wasn't a scam guys so we're going to go forward with the premise that if people lost money it was a scam but if it was truly such a bad promo we won't blame aiden ross so let's find out let's dig into the details of crypto scams and find out did aiden ross cause more people to lose money all right guys so here i've prepared a little presentation for you guys on how crypto scams work because we have to understand some things before we evaluate how well or bad aiden ross's promotion was because people don't understand how cryptos games work they think people think price is everything but the problem is it's not see if you looked at the milf token market cap you would see this here's where aiden ross promoted around may 27th right here and the price actually really fell so if you thought price was everything then aiden ross's point makes sense price was high earlier and then aiden ross promotes and the price nothing really happens but the truth is that's not what makes a crypto a scam actually it almost has nothing to do with it it's nice to have a high price but the real problem with scam coins is finding a buyer okay here's an example we have a sample problem in front of us let's say you have 10 million scam ross tokens okay hypothetical token i just made up let's say each are priced at a dollar i own 10 million of them uh does that mean i have 10 million dollars well the answer is obviously no because unless someone buys them and actually pays a dollar on the market it doesn't mean anything and so you can't sell like let's say i'm the owner of this i can't sell my scam ross tokens if the volume of the coin is low if there's not a lot of people trading it back and forth like let's say only one token gets traded you know a day it would take me 10 million days to offload these tokens so it's basically worthless the truth is that trading volume is the king for scam coins in order to offload your money and actually realize those gains to actually scam people you need high volume okay in other words you need enough buyers to buy up those 10 million scam ross tokens i hope we're all on the same page here on how it works if i just dump 10 million coins into the market the price is gonna collapse and no one's gonna buy it up right so you have to have enough buyers so the question is how do you get new buyers i'm sorry this is like a it's like a blockchain presentation here guys i said i'd be doing easier investigations i don't know why i'm doing a thing but yeah the question how do we get new buyers and the answer is this guy aka just just influencers you you buy influencers guys buying influencers means more volume more volume means that the people who hold the tokens the scammers okay the people who invented these tokens yesterday can then sell it off today right this is how these things work and to be clear milf token's like a dead coin it's dead all the all of aiden's viewers who bought it they have like it's worth nothing now so let's check the truth because now that we know price doesn't really matter now we can check if the promotion actually worked so let's take a look at the volume data i've put it here this is from the blockchain blockchain doesn't lie people we all know this so on may 22nd may 23rd this is all leading up to the promotion the volume is pretty stable at a 24 hour volume of about a million dollars being traded sometimes less sometimes more so what do you think it's worth to have aiden ross promote your coin we know they paid him about two hundred thousand dollars to promote the coin let's take a look at the next day and i did the did you the favor of putting it into a bar chart we're getting fancy around here uh yeah turns out it was pretty good guys the day of aiden ross's promo the bad promo bro hey it was a bad promo they got 19 million dollars in 24 hour volume 19 million dollars probably half of that's buy half of that sell roughly since the price stayed roughly the same so let's say we've got nine million dollars in sell orders taking place that day somebody offloaded nine million dollars onto who's the new buyers aiden ross's fans now aiden ross says that uh everything's fine because you know how could it be a scam if he he got paid in u.s dollars right well let's take a look at at the efficiency of that spending for the milf token right how efficient is it to buy stupid influencers and greedy influencers for your coin well let's take a look i put aidan ross's cost to promote against the volume so you got this much volume 19 million dollars in exchange for 200 000 it's about an extra 15 16 17 million dollars in trading volume all for 200 000 i'd call that a good deal i don't know what do you guys think you call that a good deal and what would you call the guy who promotes this stuff what would you what would you title that because i can't believe people are letting him get away with this lie that it was a bad promo bro hassan you pay attention to the analytics bro you pay attention to all analytics you i know you were on that i used to watch you when back when the election was going on bro you pay attention to every statistic at every minute of the day you saw that after that it went down it was not a scam of pumping up nothing actually aiden i do pay attention to all the analytics and um yeah turns out it was a scam it was a pump and dump now you may not have been the person selling the tokens you may have just gotten paid 200 000 flat rate but uh somebody pumped and dumped thanks to you i mean without you we couldn't have seen these kind of numbers right so your fans got scammed because you're a scumbag influencer who sells out your fans for two hundred thousand dollars in exchange for 15 million dollars roughly in extra volume and so that is a scam period it is a puff and up you may try to hide behind the fact you only got paid 200 000 flat rate but try telling that to your fans who lost money i'm really so sick of these people trying to get away with this stuff saying i did a bad promotion bro it's a pretty good promotion if you ask me high roi here so conclusion well aiden ross did scam his fans he ran a pump and dump that other people benefited from while he made a flat 200 000 and he potentially made milf scammers millions and i gotta say as a disclaimer though aiden ross to be clear wasn't the only one who made money that day right some others familiar faces made money off the milf promotions too um for example i'll show you guys real quick as we end this this one influencer who made about 128 000 according to blockchain selling milf tokens for promoting it as well check it out you guys know i've been investing in a lot of cryptocurrency lately and one coin recently that came up i actually saw from jake paul as well it's called milf it's insane guys i 25 x my investment which is just nuts but this is a dope coin guys definitely swipe up and check it out [Music] milf [Music] somehow you ain't say much what a waster someone with their fame up you took from everyone including all your day ones i can't believe it still the truth you need a spill you proof the greed is real you can't delete it chill from the start it was doomed i heard
