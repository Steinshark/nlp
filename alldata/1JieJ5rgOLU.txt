today we're going to be looking at the 10 most common errors that you can get in Python when they will be raised and how we can solve them now knowing how to raise an error in Python a specific error really demonstrates that you've mastered the concept of that exception and this is important because one day when you will run into that exception again you will know exactly how to solve it and it just makes coding so much more straightforward when you know what an error actually does so the first error that we're going to cover today is the attribute error and you'll notice this happening when you're trying to call a method on an object that just does not exist it's an invalid attribute of that object for example pretend you have a number which is going to equal 10. now pretend we want to append to this number the value of 10. we are calling an attribute that belongs to list not to number and if we try to run this we will get the attribute error because the int object has no attribute of append and an even easier way to understand this is to create a class create an instance of that class and to use a method that doesn't exist from that class such as dot run here I didn't Define anything inside the class so we will get the attribute error that Apple object has no attribute run number two assertion error and this is one of the easiest errors to understand because we are manually creating it so for example if we have some Boolean that says has connection and we're going to set this Boolean to false but in the program we want to assert that this connection is true because without the connection the program shouldn't work so here we can type in assert has connection and if there's no connection we're just going to type in no connection as the error message so right here we're asserting that there is a connection we're trying to make sure that there is an internet connection and if we run this we're going to get the assertion error because this has connection Boolean failed it was false which means that the session did not go through and it raised an assertion error number three import error in Python you're probably familiar with the concept of installing packages you type pip install you can say something such as pillow and it's going to install that package and then you can refer to it when you try to import something such as import pillow or here it would be import pill and this is fine because we have this package but what if we try to import something that doesn't exist such as import subscribe if we try to use subscribe we can reference it and we can do some stuff with it such as subscribe append and that's going to be valid python code but when we run this we're going to get the module not found error there's no module named subscribe and most code editors will warn you that you're trying to import something that cannot be found which is great but some might not some might just have a squiggly line that says hey there's something suspicious about this import check it out and it's probably because you've not imported that module number four syntax error the syntax error is probably the number one error you will run into when you're starting with python it just tells you that you're typing in something that python cannot itself understand it's syntax or language that does not belong to python for example if you say x say hello we're going to get a syntax error because none of this follows the python coding Convention as you can see here say is invalid syntax to fix this you would have to add an equal sign and you would have to change hello into something that python can recognize such as a string and as soon as you run that it will run perfectly fine another example of getting a syntax error is for example using the print statement and not closing the parentheses this is a feature that belongs to python that requires you to use two parentheses to enclose some arguments in a function another example would be to create a function without using the colon you can still do stuff in here or we can actually just type in pass but it will give us the syntax error that it expected the colon for that function to be recognized so insert that colon and you'll get rid of the syntax error and this is also valid with keywords you need to make sure that you're naming things correctly or else python will not understand what you're trying to do number five type error a type error is an error that informs us that we're trying to perform some sort of operation that just does not make sense because the types are not compatible for example if we print something such as hello plus 10 this is valid code but this operation is invalid because you cannot concatenate a string with an integer and if you run this you'll get the type error because you can only concatenate a string with string or int with int and it's not really concatenation if you put an INT with an INT it's just addition of course but you need to make sure that you have the correct data types for your function call or you're going to get a type error if you're enjoying this video so far please do remember to leave a like it helps me understand how well the video is doing so I can then make more videos similar to this one or whether I should try working with a different topic but let's get back to the video so for error number six we have index error and this has to do with lists so if we have a list of numbers for example and here we type in one two three and we try to access one of these numbers let's say at the index of 10 we're going to get an index error because we're trying to access an element that does not exist it is out of this list which only has three elements so the max we can do inside here is try to get the second element and the same thing goes for tuples and for anything that you can actually grab an item by index so here we try to grab an element at the index of 10 we're going to get another index error number seven name error a name error is raised when a variable name is not found in the global or the local scope so for example if you try to do something such as def do something and here all you do is say x equals 10 and later on you try to print X we're going to get a name error because X could not be found in the global scope it will work inside here of course because we have X inside the do something function but if you have a variable that has not been defined and you try to use it you're going to get this name error so we can't just print hello just like that because that name has not been defined number eight recursion error suppose you have a function and you try to do some recursion in there if you end up trying to attempt a recursion without any limits there is going to be a maximum recursion depth that is associated with your computer which you might have to increase the limits for and if you don't you are going to run into this recursion error as stated down here recursion error maximum recursion depth exceeded and this is actually quite a nice error because if you do something like this by accident you might not even notice it it might just run in the background indefinitely but with this recursion error we were able to understand that we did something funky far too fast and it ended up throwing this recursion error number nine indentation error and this is probably one of the most infamous errors you will have when you get started with python because you might create a function that says hello and you might say on the next line print hello if you try to run this it's going to give us that indentation error because in Python you're required to create blocks by indentation so if you want to show that this actually belongs to the hello function you need to indent it and put it inside the block now you can also add a space if you want that's a valid form of indentation although I highly advise you not to do that so that you can maintain the readability of your code and for number 10 we have the value error and I'm going to explain this first by using an import so I'm going to import math and here what we're going to do is print math dot square root of -10 now if we run this we're going to get a value error because -10 is not a number that can be used with square root it is an invalid value so it raised the value error and this can be fixed by providing a proper value you can say 10 for example and you'll get the square root back but if we change it back to -10 we will get that value error because that's not a valid value that can be used with square root a much more simple example would be to create a number which is going to be the integer of the string of hello this is perfectly valid you can add a string inside there if you want but as soon as we try to run this code we're going to get a value error that you cannot type cast a string into an integer even though it was accepted as an argument since you can put anything you want in there it was not a value that could be converted into an integer so those were 10 of the most popular errors that you will encounter when you are coding in Python I would love to hear other errors that you've encountered throughout your career as a python programmer in the comment section down below but with all that being said as always thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video
