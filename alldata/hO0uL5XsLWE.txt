a brief incomplete and mostly wrong history of programming languages Joseph Mary Jacquard used Punch Cards to instruct a loom to weave hello world into a tapestry redditors of the time are not impressed due to the lack of tail call recursion concurrency or proper capitalization 1801 1842 Ada Loveless writes the first program she has hampered in her efforts by the minor inconvenience that she doesn't have any actual computers to run her code Enterprise Architects will will later re-learn her techniques in order to program in uml Java Engineers are seething right now no you can pre-plan your whole projects you just gotta understand a few patterns 1936 Alan Turing invents every programming language that will ever be but is shanghaied by British intelligence to be 007 before he can patent them that is one way to put what happened to Alan Turing that is perhaps one way to put it uh 1936 Alonso Church also invents every language that will ever be but does it better his Lambda calculus is ignored because it is insufficiently sea-like this criticism occurs in spite of the fact that c has not been invented it's so true this is very true uh 1940 various uh computers are programmed using direct wiring and switches Engineers do this in order to avoid Tab versus spaces debate I unironically yesterday got into a bit of a tabs versus spaces talk yeah it happened it genuinely happened at my job that bike shed is alive it's well and people live in that I work at Netflix by the way just in case you're wondering uh 1957 John Backus and IBM create Fortran there's nothing funny about IBM or Fortran it is a syntax error to write Fortran while not wearing a blue tie laughs that's a pretty good one uh John McCarthy and Paul Graham invent a lisp due to the high cost caused by a post-war depletion of the Strategic parentheses Reserve lisp never becomes popular one in spite of its lack of popularity lists now lisp or sometimes Arc remains an influential language in key algorithmic techniques such as recursion and condescension foreign [Laughter] it's so good it's so good it's so good it's so good all right after losing a bet with L Ron Hubbard Grace Hopper and several other sadists invent the capitalization of boilerplate oriented language Cobalt a year later in a misguided and sexist Revelation against uh Admiral uh at Admiral Hopper Cobalt work uh Ruby conference frequently featured misogynistic material wait what what did I just read is this a dig at dhh I can't even tell what I just read years later in a misguided and sexist retaliation against Admiral Hopper's Cobalt work ruby conferences frequently featured misogynistic material what does that even mean okay I must be missing the joke is there a joke that I'm missing is this like the pie conference the pycon 8 where some dude was like uh doggle that died you know what I mean and then boom the internet blows up and there's never been a conference the same sense John uh kameni and Thomas Kurtz create basic an unstructured programming language for non-computer scientists 1965 kemi and Kurtz go to 1964. it's pretty good guy steal and uh Gerald geralt oh geralt of of Riviera uh Gerald Steele and get a guy stealing Gerald Sussman create scheme their work leads to a series of Lambda the ultimate papers culminating in Lambda the ultimate kitchen utensil this paper becomes the basis for long running but ultimately unsuccessful run of late night infomercials lambdas are relegated to relative obscurity until Java makes them Popular by not having them hmm with a method uh in 1970 Nicolas are worth creates Pascal a procedural language critics immediately denounce Pascal because it uses X uh bad guy from Turok 2 X Plus y syntax instead of the more familiar C like interfa uh C like x equals X Plus y this criticism happens in spite of the fact that c has not been invented yet you know why is C just the why does c feel like the right way why why is it why why does c win Dennis or Ricky uh Richie invents a powerful gun that shoots both forward and backwards simultaneously not satisfied with the number of deaths and permanent maimings from that invention he invents C and eunuchs I mean it's pretty good see the problem is it only kills two people at a time if both shots hit that's only if both shots hit you know what I mean that means if you shoot it like Arnold you're gonna die uh let's see uh Elaine a call do I say this name Elaine uh designs the logic pro language prologue his goal is to create a language with the intelligence of a two-year-old he proves that he has reached his goal by showing a prologue session that says no to every query let's go that is so correct that joke is way more funny now that I've had four kids uh Robin Milner creates MLA language based on the Eminem type Theory ml begets SML which has a formerly specified semantics when asked for a formal semantics of the formal semantics Milner's heads explodes other other well-known languages in the ml family including ocamel F sharp and Visual Basic let's go oh Campbell we got an oh Campbell mention let's go if I if I had the time to program any language I'd want right now I O camel would be the language in 1980 Allen K creates small talk and invents the term object oriented when asked what it means he replies Small Talk programs are just objects when asked what objects are made of he replies objects when asked again he look he says look it's all objects all the way down until you reach Turtles it's a fair statement I like turtles uh in honor of ADA Loveless ability to create programs that never ran Jean ickback uh and the U.S Department of Defense creates Ada programming language in spite of the lack of evidence that any significant Ada program is ever completed historians believe Ada to be a successful Public Works project that keeps several thousand roving defense contractors out of gangs oh no in 1983 Bjorn Starship uh bolts everything he's ever heard of on to see and creates C plus plus the resulting language is so complex that programs must be sent to the Future to be compiled by Skynet artificial intelligence build time suffer skynet's motives for performing the service remain unclear but spokespeople from the future says there is nothing to be concerned about baby in an Australian accent monotones and in August let's see in an Austrian accent monotones there's nothing to be concerned about baby there are some there are some speculation that Skynet is nothing more than a pretentious buffer overrun 1986 Brad Cox and Tom love create Objective C announcing this language has all the memory safety of C combined with all the Blazing speed of small talk modern historians suspect the two were very were dyslexic that's as someone who's done a decent amount of objective c this is a great statement this is a great statement okay this is beautiful in 1987 Larry wall falls asleep and hits Larry Wall's forehead on the keyboard upon waking Larry wall decides that the string of characters on Larry Wall's monitor isn't random but an example program in a programming language that God wants his Prophet Larry wall to design Pearl is born this is an actual factual statement okay this is not a mostly incorrect this is actually a very correct statement in 1990 a committee of formed by Simon uh Payton Jones Paul haddock Philip wadler Ashton Kutcher and people and the people for the ethical treatment of animals create Haskell a pure non-strict functional style language Haskell gets some resistance due to the complexity of using monads to control side effects Walter tries to appease critics by explaining that a monad is a monoid in the category of endo functors what's the problem does programmer Guido van Rossum travels to Argentina for a mysterious operation he returns a with a large a cranial scar in fence python is declared dictator for Life by Legions of followers and announces to the world there is only one way to do it Poland becomes nervous to read what was pretty good though I'll give it it's pretty good in 1995 a uh at a Neighborhood Italian restaurant Rasmus uh lerdorf realizes that his plate of spaghetti is an excellent model for understanding the world wide web and that web applications should mimic their medium on the back of his napkin he designed programming programmable hyperlink pasta PHP PHP documentation remains on that napkin to this day Taylor otwell shook right now Taylor is shook what they forgot to say is that napkin is also in a Lamborghini so it's like you know how bad is it Yakir uh Yuki hero uh Mad Max uh Matt's samodo uh creates Ruby to advert some vaguely unspecified apocalypse that will leave Australia a desert run by mohead a mohawked Warriors and Tina Turner the language is later renamed Ruby on Rails by its real inventor David dhh the bit about Matsumoto inventing a language called Ruby never happened and better be removed in the next revision of this article dhh the man loves not having types in 1995 Brendan Ike reads up on every mistake ever made designing a programming language invents a few more and creates a live script later in an effort to cash in on the popularity of java the language is renamed to JavaScript later still in an effort to cash in on the popularity of a skin disease the language is renamed ecmascript and so it's actually pretty accurate it's a pretty accurate statement right there that's just that's just that's just reality 1996 James Gosling invents Java Java is relatively verbose garbage collected class based wait hold on how did breaded Ike invent oh later on it's renamed okay wait did JavaScript appear before Java I know this is mostly incorrect I know this is an incorrect history but JavaScript came out before Java this has to be a troll because null yeah it has to be a troll troll because null as BR from Brennan Ike's own mouth is that he had to do null because of java so it has to it this can it cannot be it cannot be news from CNN James Gosling invents Java Java is relatively verbose garbage collected class-based statically typed single dispatch object-oriented language with single implementation inheritance and multiple interface inheritance some loudly Herald's javel's novelty Anders halesberg invents C sharp C sharp is a relatively verbose garbage collected class-based statically typed single dispatch object-oriented language with single implementation inheritance and multiple interface inheritance Microsoft loudly Heralds a c-sharp's novelty 2003 a drunken a Martin deski sees Reese Reese's Peanut Butter Cups oh my goodness Reese's Peanut Butter Cup ad featuring somebody peanut butter getting on somebody else's chocolate and has an idea he creates scallop a language that unifies constructs from both object oriented and functional languages this pisses off both groups and each promptly declares Jihad that's actually pretty accurate I feel like nobody likes Scala except for people that like Scala but nobody likes people that like Scala I don't want to teach my kid to code I want him to Splash in muddy water uh let's see in muddy puddles and smear paint on the walls and read novels under the covers way too late at night I grew up uh too soon I wish I had more time to be a kid why do School uh schools teach vocational skills so young these days but is it possible to smear paint on the walls without creating valid Pearl based Jake Archibald first off your name is like a comic as it is and your response is poetic the name it's probably a valid programming link I mean it's probably it's probably a valid programming language it's probably a valid Pearl program what did I get programming language from what's wrong with my brain uh Hey the perligent she wears a pearl of gen necklace I think I need to end the video now
