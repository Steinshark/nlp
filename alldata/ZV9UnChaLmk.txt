[Music] hi folks i'm having a conversation with jonathan pejo he's an artist and a public speaker who i suppose rose to prominence uh through his work with jordan peaceon uh jonathan how are you i've been great it's good to meet you i've i've been following your work i guess since jordan peterson kind of appeared online and he was on your channel i started to pay attention a little bit to you and so it's uh it's nice to talk to you yeah thank you um right so um i guess the the best place for us to start would probably be i don't know about 10 or 20 years ago with the sort of rise of the new atheists i think uh this this is the sort of foundation of the the root of one of the problems that we found ourselves in um would you like to tell me what your opinion of the new atheists is and how you feel that their movement has developed and what's happened to it i would say on the one hand i when the new atheists kind of appeared on the scene i was very aggravated with their with their the way they spoke and their arguments but i also felt like people couldn't understand the counter argument it's very strange people were struggling to understand how what how to frame the counter argument um and i've been kind of developing my ideas for years not just about that but partly about how to answer this kind of argument and then jordan peterson appeared and we realized when he discovered my work as well that we were on the same page and i feel like he broke through the wall in trying to explain the problem of the new atheist movement and bringing back the notion of consciousness the problem of framing and of uh the question of uh how phenomena manifest itself and patterns all of this stuff which the new atheists just ignored because they were so focused on kind of science scientific questions they didn't realize the the problem of the viewer and the problem of consciousness in the whole let's say in the pattern of all of this together so i feel like that has been kind of broken and also we're seeing more and more as we watched our society break down we watch how everything is fragmenting and people are at each other's throats that the the glue that unites us together it's slipping and you know and we it's not based on facts it's something more it's something like identity or something you know something that brings us together and the question is what is the foundation of that unity and i think that that's also a place where a lot of people who are interested in the new atheist argument are wondering okay so okay so if we agree with this kind of argumentation then why do we exist as societies like what binds us together yeah i i've got a very um similar view because i mean i don't know whether you know about my personal history but i mean i was always a huge fan of christopher hitchens uh being somewhat of a contrarian myself and it's only as i have matured out of my 20s and 30s now into my 40s that i realize how short-sighted the new atheist seems to have been because i mean it's very easy to break apart the dogmatism that comes from a 2000 year old book obviously it's not going to be consistent or scientific or rational obviously it vastly predates that era but that's kind of missing the point of it isn't it because the the really the point i think is to provide sort of um moral direction and i think that uh without this when you take this away you kind of leave people in a bit of a fog not knowing what they should be doing with their lives and we're kind of left in this very sort of hedonistic utilitarian period where almost anything seems to go now there's no particular boundaries anymore other than direct physical harm and so if you're not directly harming someone or it's not obvious that you've someone's in pain then pretty much anything goes doesn't it yeah and my argument i would say starts a little bit before that in the sense that i think that religion is that is not really about morality at first glance it's morality it's about morality downstream but at the first level it's about creating a a pattern of being a pattern of how the world exists and so and and so it's very imagistic it ends up being an imagistic pattern a story pattern uh also a architectural pattern you can imagine like a pattern in space how space manifests itself um and then from there there will be some moral questions which will come down but once you look at the sacred text in terms of uh a story in terms of imagistic really much almost like if you're reading lord of the rings and you want to understand lord of the rings if you read the bible that way you'll understand it a lot better than if you try to nitpick at it and try to find how it's scientifically not accurate but if you look at it as a kind of grand story and a grand narrative in which we are we frame our existence then then not only is it actually quite coherent but you realize that the categories that are used in scripture let's say are actually the categories that although not scientific are the categories that we live in right and you could say something like you know the sun the sun doesn't turn around the earth and and then you could you could make all these arguments to say how stupid people who thought that in the past were but you still get up in the morning and you still go to bed at night and the sun still goes down over the horizon and so phenomenologically it's still an experience that manages our life yeah the way the way i've been uh viewing this is essentially separating the two thought processes out into scientific thinking and what i guess i'll just call mythological thinking and both have predictive power and this is something that i think that people who are entirely bound up with scientific thinking can't bring themselves to admit uh it doesn't matter if helios isn't really pushing the chariot of the sun around the earth every day uh the point is you know an ancient greek uh pagan knows that the sun's gonna rise in the morning the next day and he knows he's gonna get a procession of uh seasons so he knows when to plant it's gone and so even though you know it might not technically be correct it still has predictive power and it's it's woven into a larger scheme of meaning for that person and allows them to kind of identify their place in the world relative to others and things like this and this is what i think that the the the ball i think the new atheists dropped with the deconstruction of christianity and other religions of course um is that it's most people's daily life is actually a lot more mythological than it is scientific you know most people don't really understand why a lot of the things that happen around them happen uh it's you know on a technical level but they do have the kind of superstitious sort of view of the world and this this i just think is just normal this is most people's lives and this is how people i think think of themselves as well you know you are your own story in which you are a hero you know you are the protagonist and you know there are villains the people who bullied you at school or you know whatever it is you know there are the villains of this story and so i don't think it's illegitimate to think of ourselves in a less scientific way and in fact i've been thinking about this a lot like it seems actually to encompass the kind of spark of the the the precious nature of a human life can actually be very easily dismissed as soon as you abandon the kind of uh religious worldview or the mythological worldview uh it seems very easy to justify killing a lot of people which happened all through the 20th century yeah and not only that but if you look at people today and and who may let's say who think that religion is superfluous and think that let's say just secular culture is fine they're still on the horizon anti-natalist and anti-human sentiment even in the the ecological movement there's massive anti-human uh sentiment in that and people don't realize how far that can go and what that can lead to but they they take up the arguments in everyday life you'll meet someone who who will say how how we're parasites on the earth and how you know we're destroying everything and it's like man that's that's there's some scary stuff down the line from that type of argumentation that you don't understand oh totally i mean i i remember seeing an argument that we shouldn't mine asteroids and that we should leave them for the universe and it's like why what what you know and and again like even even though even though they end up in this kind of uh you know like you say anti-human sort of view i mean there's something kind of mythological about the way they're conceiving of the universe there's a kind of holistic divine whole that mankind is sullying or profaning in some way by mining these asteroids or whatever it is and i i just find this to be a ridiculous sentiment yeah well i think that one of my arguments has really been that if you don't take care of the mythological in an explicit manner if you don't have uh rituals if you don't have sacred spaces if you don't have the structures that let's say manifest this aspect of the human person then it's going to be there anyways it's you can't get rid of it and it's good it's going to come back in all kinds of insane crazy ways like we saw in the us with all the george floyd protests they were religious in nature everything they were doing this the self-flagellation the kneeling the iconography all of it yeah you had these images of him as like a saint or even as christ sometimes and so the idea is if you try to say that this is irrelevant it's going to creep back and it's going to show itself in in monstrous manner so it's better to to deal with it explicitly and to have you know to have rituals to have sacred spaces to have this as part of what a culture is rather than leave it up to the chaos to kind of manifest these these passions let's say oh i i totally agree with you and like it does seem to be just an innate characteristic of like humans being able to kind of heuristically guide themselves through the world you know and have a general understanding of things it seems like it's inevitable and innate and inescapable and i think this is kind of the um the great conceit of the enlightenment is that we can become these scientific rational beings it's like well maybe we can but for about a hundred thousand years we weren't and i think it's a bit arrogant to uh suggest that something would just flip the table and suddenly everything will be different everyone will be perfectly rational and the thing is as soon as you enter into that mind space you realize that you're being entirely materialistic and one one of the things that um i really kind of despise actually i'm beginning to really despise about enlightenment thought generally is the interchangeability of everything this is a really real concern for me i mean it's fine when you're talking about material products but even then it make you know the commodification of everything even human beings means you have to reduce everything to its most basic parts and so there's nothing special or unique or artistic anymore but but then essentially you as an individual have no special value you know you're not mythic um and the the the uh the uh i've had a lot of people asking me recently like um for some because i've been talking about the subject and the way that i've been trying to explain it is that look like if i found the sword of alexander the great you know you might be able to you know if i and i could guarantee i i broke into his tomb or something you know and in his coffin i pull out his sword that sword has got like mythical significance to the people who know who alexander the great is and think of him in in good manner you know you you can make all the replicas of this you want you could set up a factory line producing replicas of alexander the great sword but they will never be alexander the great sword you know i'll have the only one and it's it's the same thing with you know every and this is the kind of it's like an overlay that goes over the world you know the sort of mythical narrative you know it's like the the spear of longinus you know the piece of the true cross all of these things are totally irreplaceable and they are beyond the concept of value you know they are priceless so they're inevitable and it's actually the world manifests itself even our own categories even all the categories we use even the scientific categories we use to define the world are value-laden because the all f let's say all phenomena has an indefinite amount of ways you could describe it it has an indefinite amount of possibilities of of existing let's say and so the categories we use are always categories which take into account the importance that humans have for it even like i said in scientific research like we we the even in research the funding that goes into research will be based on values that will decide what is important to research and what is important to understand so even though it's objective in terms of the facts that they find the reason why we're even looking at those facts is is based on value and that's been i would say one of the main things that i've been trying to do for the past four years is to help people understand hierarchy is to help people understand how hierarchy lays itself out how these all the images we have from scripture the the temple the tabernacle the mountain heaven and earth you know the garden with the central tree all of these images are there to help us understand what hierarchy is but and once you understand that you also can understand what's happening to us now because understanding hierarchy also means understanding how that breaks down and the image of how hierarchy breaks down is a way to understand what is happening to us right and so this idea from the ancient world that you had your own fellows right you had your navel of the world and on the edge of the world you had all these monsters with like strange heads and and mixtures of different animals it's like you can think that that's mythical but when you see the crazy tattooed pierced person with pink hair you're like it's not it's happening to you right now these monsters are coming out of the dark and they're coming out into the street so don't tell me it's just a it's just a story because it's happening to us no no i totally agree again it has predictive value if you go far enough away from the familiar you're going to come into a realm of essentially monsters you know it's going to be exactly as you say it's going to be strange it's going to be dangerous you're not going to know what's happening and it's going to be an adventure that in the you know the hero's journey of it you get back and you're going to explain to everyone look i saw some crazy stuff out there and this happens everywhere you know this this happens when i went over to la for the first time you know i had to explain to my like my wife and my family you know people over there are very different you know it's it's a strange world you know uh compared to compared to my nice house in england um so this is true about everything not just like let's say human interaction stories but even normal categories of being like like i always use example of a cup so there's an identity of a cup like there's an invisible pattern of the of a cup and then there are examples of cups in the world and there are some examples that are like is it a cup is it a glass it's it it's in between it's kind of it's kind of on the fringe of what a cup can be and that's totally fine as long as you can see that it's kind of a monster cup then it has its role in the world it's fine for it to be there like it's also fine for the monsters to exist they they're they're inevitable in how the world lays itself out the problem is when the monster tries to take the the throne right the monster the problem is when the monster tries to get into the altar that's the problem it's not that there are monsters out there and they're that there are things that don't fit into categories those are normally there and that you can't get rid of them the problem we have now is that it's like we're in the monsters have come into the they're coming in and they're trying to take the throne and that's it's not good for the monsters either which is something that a lot of the monsters don't understand because you are you you're not gonna like it there it's because your whole idea is to not be normative if you're not normative why would you want to take the normality yeah and not be good to you i find that really interesting actually it's a really good way of framing it because and you are you're essentially setting the entire hierarchy on its head and put it putting the thing that should be the furthest from being in charge in charge and so that's going to change the nature of everything uh any any justifying or legitimating structures that you had are going to suddenly have to change they're going to become illegitimate things are going to be completely different and and not only that but you take away the meaning of the people who are already invested in this hierarchy and we i don't know whenever you say the word hierarchy it sounds it sounds like there's implicitly a form of oppression tied up in it but that's but that's not the case and i mean some hierarchies of course are oppressive naturally but uh others are not oppressive and in fact are conducive to liberty conducive to freedom and security and happiness and prosperity you know if without a state we don't have property rights and therefore we need this kind of hierarchy in order to make sure that the contract for this office is enforced you know so the the landlord doesn't just turf me out and take my money you know there's there's all sorts of reasons that we have these things and you're right putting putting the the unknown monsters in charge of the hierarchy is bad for everyone it's a great one the hierarchy hierarchy is both it's both at the same time it's it's a method of exclusion and a method of participation it also shows you how to participate in the pattern because without a hierarchy you have no way of knowing right you have no way of knowing who's the best runner if you don't have a hierarchy of runners and so once you have a higher care runner it's like okay here here's the best runner i'm not that good and now i know what access i have like where am i on the on the the ladder and i can have to reach i can reach up i can try to to get better in my hierarchy but without the hierarchy if you just let's say let's say you start you have a race and then for slower people you get them you let them start first because you know they're slower then all of a sudden everything just breaks down because you don't even know like what excellence is and you don't even you're even if you win there's no value in the winning they it's just become a blind point to do that would be to avoid the concept of a winner or a loser wouldn't it if you're trying to sort of equalize these things you're saying there's actually something wrong with being a winner and a loser and you i like the way you um the frame as well the uh the sort of inclusive nature of it if there is no hierarchy what are you trying to be included in and that's why one of the like i've been talking about this recently i've been pushing it and i i made a video recently on parasitic storytelling you know with like all the crazy stuff we're seeing in the franchises and my point at the in the end was that because the the the weird kind of parasitic storytelling of like you know the the women beating up the men and all the stuff that we're seeing in in these stories uh it always has to re-establish the hierarchy because it has to be the victim of it and so in the end in the very pattern of this weird upside down world is the key to bringing it right side up because this the position of the center is always open because they have to restate it all the time and so what ends up the key now to storytelling i think and i'm telling people this is keep an eye out for these types of stories are kind of return of the king stories right where the world becomes upside down robin hood style you know an illegitimate kind of horrible prince takes over and then the good guy has to act like a robber and has to be like a trickster and then it flips back when or the lion heart comes back and then we reestablish a normal a normal order and i think that that's also it's also one of the reasons why people like you for example and other people who were there you know several years ago appeared at first as kind of weird trickster kind of uh let's say uh troll type figures and then slowly shifted towards people who kind of saw the pattern and saw the the importance of of social hierarchies and stories and all of this and so it's like these weird upside down figures who were kind of end it now are ending up bringing back a kind of order you know this is the robin hood figure i would say i i totally agree and i like the use of the um the robin hood metaphor that you're using here because the the the the entire sort of arc of robin hood really does come back around to the king reintegrating robin in to his court uh so i i think the earliest stories he wasn't actually a noble but like in later tellings he was but the the point is robin hood represents um an aspect of the the the culture uh that is responding to something that is fundamentally wrong something that is unjust something is not being dealt with as is proper and as you say the return of the king the legitimate king the legitimate king recognizes what robin hood is doing and why he's doing it you know and that that's an important thing and you're right i mean i think that people like myself the sort of you know dissident outlaw types um i i i agree i think that's the reason we're doing anything we're doing to be honest there's something right and it's very fast i talked about this like in 2017 i was talking about you and milo and uh all these weird figures that kind of appeared online and and talking about how when when the world is upside down then the fool is going to turn it right side up and so one of the hashtags i put out is called watch the fools and like kanye west is playing that role right now kanye is totally playing that role where he is a crazy guy like he's still wild and crazy and does weird stuff but then he says things that no one is allowed to say because he's seen as this kind of full character and he says things that no one's allowed to say and it's actually just normal common sense like the most common sense thing he ends up saying but no one else is because it's like because the world is upside down normal things aren't uh we can't even say normal things no i totally agree and one one of the um one of the things i found interesting is that kanye did an interview with the tmz uh new uh sort of celebrity news out there and in the studio he was getting a lot of grief from other black people who worked at the thing but he didn't approach this you could see it in his face he did he wasn't offended uh he just had a very determined look on his face as in right i know i'm right i know i can see something true how can i project this across and the problem was getting his message across not the fact that he wasn't sure about his message and i was like i've been following kanye's sort of political activism in the same way because i i really think that what he did was very brave uh when in 2018 he's wearing the maga hat and went to the white house i think that's tremendously brave and he's doing it out of almost like a there's a weird kind i think there's an impulse in these kinds of characters that kind of tricks their characters and it's a and it's really a pattern of being where you know you have these these these kind of holy fool characters or these traditional characters in ancient societies like the jester or the heyoka in native american cultures where their whole role is to point out you know the foibles of the system right and so they're there to point out how the system is limited but the question is when the whole system is corrupt and what does the fool have to do if they're going to point out something they're going to actually point out the need for the system it's going to be it's just it's like an impulse it's just it's just going to happen yeah no i totally agree like i i think that the the fool uh plays the role of um testing the legitimacy of the system because the system has got to be able to endure the fool and that shows that it's being run correctly and if the full it's like when the king kills the fool you know you are dealing with the tyrannical kings the fool is meant to be able to say anything and everyone should be able to laugh at him and then everyone's in their right place that's where the fool wanted to be it's where the king wants the fool to be it was theoretically and that there is like an understanding and an implicit understanding that this is the order and i think again this is just an expression of natural human consciousness and different personality types working together um because honestly i was always the class clown when i was in school you know i was i'm happy to play people i like you know i i have i have great great mirth in provoking serious reactions from people who should know better than to react to what i'm doing you know and so ancient like medieval culture they every year they had uh they had different fool festivals they had a festival called the feast of fools they had a feast of the ass where they would bring a donkey into the church and like bring it up the altar and people would pray like donkeys and stuff like so part of medieval culture was always to integrate this aspect of reality that's why medieval churches are built the way they do and why on the outside of churches there are gargoyles and monsters and why in the margin of medieval manuscripts they have marginalia where they have all this crazy stuff going on and like weird upside down you know mix of animals and humans just like the cosmic vision of the world how on the edge of the world are all these monsters well on the edge of the manuscript they're monsters and on the edge of the church they're monsters and so my my basic argument about people understanding religious patterns is that they're fractal in nature right they they have a pattern of being and then they manifest those patterns at all levels of reality so the cosmic the the social and then the personal because on your fringe you also have weird like undealt with stuff that is not totally in line with what you would want or what you would want your line to be so even the human person is made like a church and the church is made like the cosmos and that's basically the mythic structure of the let's say the christian mythological structure uh which as you said as we're getting rid of it then you know the world becomes topsy-turvy and upside down yeah and i i really think that is the case um and then and this this is the thing i think um didn't richard dawkins actually say something to this effect as well recently that there there may have been something about christianity that was actually worth preserving um but thank you richard thank you even for taking this yeah yeah but but the but the thing that the the i mean it's all well and good it's very easy to deconstruct someone else's uh positive vision of the world um but if you're not gonna replace it with any with something then it's going to be replaced by anything and it seems to be this sort of like drive towards absolute uh freedom or autonomy that is where we're heading and i don't think that's going to be a very healthy thing for people generally yeah and so though then the question is what do we do yeah um and and my call like the people and this is hard this is let's say it's hard a lot for a lot of people to get there is that it has to be real like it you have to get involved you have to get engaged and so we have a lot of people that are theoretically there but there are not a lot of people that are willing to to dive back in like to go to actually go to church like not a lot of people are willing to go to church well i know i've got to be honest i'm one of these people i'm not going to go to a church and well actually that's not true i go to lots of churches just as a tourist um i i don't do it for religious reasons um and so okay yeah so let's what what what are the options then to the the ex-new atheist who is finding themselves a bit uh adrift in a sea of chaos uh they don't have any particular purpose in their life but they can't find themselves believing in a religion where can they go i don't know if there's a solution in the sense that my my solution has rather been to reinvigorate christianity and to give it its original because one of the things that has to break in our mind is to think that all these people before us were idiots like once you break that then when you read the church fathers when you read it augustine or you read uh you know i i have my own favorite church fathers you realize they knew exactly what they were talking about and they did it very deliberately and so it also helps you to kind of reinvigorate christianity in a manner in which then the intellectually honest person is actually able to engage and that's let's say the people around me i would say that that's what's happening with them is that they they actually understand what this is about like when they go they go to church they see that the space of the church is organized in a cosmic pattern they realize that the year of the liturgical year let's say follows a pattern of storytelling in a cosmic pattern and they realize that the story of of christ and death and resurrection that's the story of everything like it's it's actually the pattern of reality which is showing itself to you and once you once you kind of are able to re to get back the the depth of the message then then you're able to engage and then i there are thousands of people that have been following me that are just they're they're going back to church usually a traditional church not like a kind of pop you know uh protestant type church but rather really the liturgical churches because liturgy is really a cosmic has a cosmic pattern the way that the the actual ritual of the church is set up and the way you have this hierarchy of space and this hierarchy and time and everything kind of flows out into into the world it's a completely once you get it then it's not it doesn't bother you so much like you're participating in the giant dance and you you you get involved so that's what i've been seeing i've actually i've been seeing a lot of people who are who are going back one of the alternatives is people who make up these new religions a lot of people are there a lot of new pagans and stuff people who want to make up because they they don't like christianity they want to to recapture some some idea of like pagan gods or whatever i've seen that stuff uh people have a union want to have like a more psychological approach which i understand i have sympathy for that too because it's true the problem about that is that you have to realize that it stacks up if this is really the pattern of reality and then you you go into like a psychological version of the religious pattern yeah it's like it's gonna work because it's true yeah but how does it stack up in terms of the other higher beings like how does it stack up in terms of your community your family you know your nation and it's a europe in general like how does it it has to stack up in reality yeah what what is the predictive power of it you know will it be able to tell you you know will it be able to predict your wife's reaction to a thing or your children's reaction to a thing or you know your neighbors your friends you know will you be a better person by the end of it all of these sort of considerations that have just gone by the wayside like the very it's i find it strange that the word virtue is so unfashionable because everyone demonstrates virtues all the time everyone respects virtues when they see them and they revile vices and say by the same capacity and you can't help yourself but to do it and yet we're still not allowed to talk about virtue you know the question is never ask you know is it good or bad well you know but is it virtuous is it you know should you be doing it because it implies that there is a set of uh sort of overarching prescriptions that maybe you should be following even if you know in the immediate there's no particular harm from having that extra cookie and that extra cookie after five years of eating extra cookies you know the harm you know you know and and so that there is that is definitely advice and you know you shouldn't be doing it and we've we've kind of moved away from the i guess autocratic deity telling you that's the case through the priest uh now it seems that people have been left in a position where they've kind of got to figure this out on their own and that scene hamstrings one of the things too that is harder for i think in terms of the religious question a lot of people what's hard and i can probably see it in in your vision is that one of the things that religion does is that it appeals to every level of reality that it appeals to every type of person as well and so because it is a vector of unity it's the way in which we bind ourselves together then it has to appeal to the illiterate uh dumbest person in society and so one of the things that people struggle to do is that if they they encounter that the place where it deals with the let's say the most illiterate person and they get turned off by that rather than understand that these this aspect is actually necessary and then there are higher levels that you can attain without necessarily having to care or to be involved in the more let's say superstitious or lower parts like you know if you go to church and it's annoying because you'll meet someone who's a super zealot and is a super yeah like is it is fundamentalist or is kind of has weird superstitious ideas but it's like those people are part of the world you're not gonna get rid of them so how do you deal with it you have to deal with it and if you disengage and you say well it's for them but it's not for me then who is going to be the elite of this thing that is going to help those people understand and live with it in the way that they can because there has to be an elite that's been an intellectual elite that is that is giving the information or else it gets weird when it comes to the bottom i i always thought that this was really where the new atheists dropped the ball the most and i didn't realize that at the time but what the the new atheists kind of were expressing was a kind of cognitive privilege it was you know it's very easy for them to say well i'm you know 150 iq sam harris and i've worked out that all of religion is nonsense and let me explain to you my my meditative secular meditations or whatever it does but you know my my cousin isn't 150 iq and he's been in and out of jail he needs moral guidance in his life uh he's not religious but they you know i mean it doesn't have to be religion i i i i got him to read plato and aristotle and he he was like i only read half of it it changed my life you know and it's like yes it will you know it doesn't like this this is the thing i think there's got to be a secular replacement for it because i think that um unless uh unless you're inculcated into religion as a child with a genuine sort of spiritual belief in god unless you're lucky enough to develop that i think it's i mean i don't ever see myself having that right so i don't have you don't see yourself what you don't see yourself believing god no no not having not having like genuine religious beliefs or anything like that i just i i whatever whatever is in a person that they're feeling with that i just don't have that um i i i i understand like the desire for it i i understand that you know the the i i mean i went to i went to a mass in a catholic church in italy when i was visiting um pompeii visiting the pompeii and in the in the city they've got this lovely church and me and my wife went in just to you know see what it was like and the sense of community was very very evident you know there was something more going on here than merely singing christian hymns or catholic hymns um you know there were there was there was something binding about it and you can see the appeal of the thing i just i really do think though we're kind of um at least in britain at the very least we're kind of post-christian at this point and i i think you're gonna find yourself very very uh hard-pressed to get people back into the churches but i think that you could present a worldview that is secular that still has a kind of meaning i mean i personally have been promoting aristotle a lot just because he doesn't ever appeal to deities and it's quite a holistic view of a human that he has you know he's got he seems to have got all the pieces you know fairly in line actually first time frankly and i mean i've been i've been approaching the world with an aristotelian view to you know try and be virtuous and i've lost loads of weight i'm a lot more healthy and fit than i am now my kids are happy and i'm happy and you know i i just feel better for at least being trying to do something and moreover i'm not i don't i mean i personally have never felt that i've not had any sense of meaning but my my view of what the good life is has changed because i in my 20s and like mid-30s i was like you know the consumer you know i would just play video games i would eat junk food i'd drink bottles of coke blah blah blah and now i look back and think wow i'm annoyed that i was allowed to do that i am annoyed that i essentially wasted 10 15 years of my life just existing you know not building anything not improving myself not learning anything well i didn't but like you know not anything that i think maybe i should have learned in retrospect and and well no like you know i i was into history so i'm quite lucky i you know i'd actually learned something of some revel relevance um but uh but there are lots of people who aren't learning anything of any relevance and they're just sat in the sort of kuma mindset and now i'm not in that now i'm in the sort of like let's write no you know a man's job is to build things so how so in your let's say in your idea and i and i think you're right i think that at least for your experience i i'm sure that it's true the question is what's the binding agent yes how does it stack up like so aristotle offers a way of being what christianity offered was taking aristotle and plato and plutinus and the let's say hellenistic thinkers and putting that in a story and a sacred space and a sacred timeline which would which would bind people together in in terms of identity like i said in terms of space and then in terms of of how they participate in in time it would qualify time you would say and and i don't see how you're like what what what would bind your community absolutely right yeah you're right you're absolutely right i i can only be speaking from my own personal perspective because that's aristotle's perspective that's where he's he's that's where he's originating from and that's probably why so many of the the church fathers the thought leaders of the the catholic church just called him the philosopher you know he's he's the guy you start with i mean you know he's it's a great start but as you say i'm i'm never going to end up with that catholic church experience in italy where you've got a community that is genuinely bound by some kind of glue um at the moment i've i've actually been doing a lot of research in sort of like english folklore and the sort of the moral lessons from that because i i'm an englishman you know it seems that a sort of national identity might be something that could be a binding agent there you know a bit of patriotism or something like that but um but you're i mean you are right it would be easier if this was religion um but i i think one of the things we saw that the nationalism we saw it happened that was the 20th century yeah that's i don't i don't want to call it nationalism because i i agree with george orwell's definition on nationalism and that's a that's a power game that's what you're aiming for there but a patriotism i think again by all will's definition it's a love of the place rather than a desire for power and i think that's a that's a that's a more wholesome way of approaching it um and i i think that love of the place can also be a binding agent so i'm hoping that i can discover something in there that might be useful but it's all still you know i haven't smoothed it out yet not i'm not writing a manifesto yet or anything you know just just trying to trying to live a better life to show people look it is possible it's not even very hard it's just about your decision-making you know you just have to make the right decisions i mean i'm interested in exploring though like i'm interested in exploring like at this point let's say you know you were you were like a kind of new atheist type you know several years ago and though at this point the notion that consciousness is part of reality like let's say that way right that the the human the conscious perspective is part of how reality unfolds and you can't avoid it like it just categories are part of or else it's like a quantum field of possibility but you need intelligence or pattern to kind of to to bring things together in terms of actual phenomena and so once you kind of see that you see that let's we can call it intelligence right so intelligence is the manner in which the world reveals itself to a certain extent it participates in reality and so the the traditional view is that those intelligences they don't stop at you and me intelligence is actually a part of reality it's a pattern of reality so those intelligences stack up and so you'll say something like there's an angel of london right and so london because it has an identity like how can you define a city like it's not like an apple it's really hard to say what like it's it's a it's a million billion phenomena and then but nonetheless we perceive unity in it and that unity is real it's not just subjective it's a real unity and so there's an angel of london and that intelligence is the principality which manifests the unity of the city and then that that that intelligence scales up and it and it continues to scale until you reach an infinite intelligence and that infinite intelligence is the the the pattern of all patterns so i i think that um again i'm gonna have to be one of those annoying secularists about this go for it i have to i i think that um the way the best way i would describe that is uh i think you're talking to sort of the the essence or the character of the thing um but i agree with you that there is something that you could describe as you know the angel of london and like the spirit of it the spirit of the thing you know there there absolutely is and this is i think a part of human cognition the way we again the sort of mythological thinking we don't know all the details but we know that when you know when you go to x country you're going to have a kind of experience there that you're not going to get in y country you know you know these things true so the you know the sort of character or the essence of the spirit whatever we would call it spirit's not a secular word but anyway you know what i mean um i i agree but like how are you going to protect your narrative from the deconstructionists because i i i'm actually fully on board with this kind of mythological heuristic but the deconstructionist will come along and say well now you've got to prove it so what do you say to that so you have to ride the deconstruction thing until the end you have to just write it all the way to the end right and you have to write it until you realize look the argument goes something like this the argument goes something like i talk about the reality the essence of of the cup right and then they say yeah but there's no essence of the cup like what are you talking about right it's just a bunch of stuff show me the essence that you can't find the essence it's just a bunch of stuff right and so then you ride that until the end you say yeah you're right and so uh and then they'll say the cup is just a human category and you'll say all right yeah and and so what is it if it's not if it's not a human category then it's just a bunch of stuff and atoms material yeah and so it doesn't matter it doesn't matter and so now i don't even have a drink you don't care and so the idea is the things we care about the cup that's part of how it manifests its essence we are let's say so say maximus the confessor who is one of my favorite church fathers he talks about how the human being is a laboratory for the essences of the world and so the essences of reality the human person acts as the gardener so adam in the garden of eden is a gardener and and the human categories the categories of the world go through the consciousness of human beings and manifest their reality through our consciousness but the thing is that that's not that's not an illusion or it's as real as anything is real there's nothing else that you have access to you only have access to that reality there is no other reality you have access to you can posit it imaginary reality where those categories don't exist but you you don't have access to it and so that's real and once that's real then the higher categories are as real as that one and then and then it continues to scale up there's no there's no way to to me it's like there's no way to avoid that you've really got to get to the the very bedrock where nothing exists yeah and but the and one one thing i noticed is the deconstructionist will often make exemptions for other civilizations or other cultures other peoples they'll they'll sit there and go well you have nothing but they look at them you know how does the shaman call the lightning and things like this like well that's a big question but you know by the same standard that they would say well they're allow you know if all full value is subjective and let's just say that it is for the sake of argument all value is subjective all beliefs are arbitrary or the product of an imperfect process then can i not just appeal to the very same method of validating that culture for my own and just say well this isn't this isn't universal this is not you know interchangeable this is actually something unique and particular and special and not shared by you know the the tribe over there or whatever it is and if you're going to validate them then you have to validate me on that standard that's been the surprise of post-modernism like the surprise of post-modernism has been to open up a space for us to revalue our culture because in saying because that for a while it was like these these these european ideals they're universal and so now we judge all these other tribes and we see them as being uh you know no good and they're they're the barbarians whatever whatever and then then we start to say no how can we say that it's horrible right like those other cultures are are are just as good or good or they're okay and they're fine and then we start to real but we don't realize that we're still in that position where we're using european culture as a universal view then it starts to turn and say well what are these universal values that you think are supposedly there to judge everybody else bring that down and then now we now all of a sudden european culture we can look at it and say hey that that has value like look at that look at that thing look at look at this this this whole culture that we had we can see it now because they told us we can't just stand in it invisibly so we stand in it visibly and we consciously embrace our european tradition and the christian history and you know the the also the testimony of the ancients into the greeks in terms of rome in terms of our connection with mesopotamia all of that we're like all right then then if all of if it's all these tribes and everything then i can see because it's mine so i can love it and i know if all value is subjective then they have literally no grounds to say you can't have it either because you can say but it's just my choice it's just my choice and that's that's the ultimate defense and they end up they end up actually in doing that they end up actually putting your position in the supreme powerful position they end up actually inadvertently elevating the kind of rationalistic european point of view as being universal they do it inevitably and so it's like i'm actually more postmodern than you are because i would just want to love my culture and love my tradition and participated and be involved in it and and as i said from their point of view they literally can't tell you you're wrong because it's just well it's my my subjective judgment that's enough but then the next step though is to still see is to still be capable of seeing that the patterns are true right the pattern is true even though there's difference let's say between different cultures the pattern let's say of center and periphery the pattern of hierarchy of up and down this is a universal thing like it's everywhere and and in our culture we have a particular manifestation of that and i would argue that in in the story of christianity i think we have a very very particular and i would say um powerful vision of what that means ultimately because what we offer at the top of the hierarchy is self-sacrifice which is not there i don't they don't find that very much you find a little hint of it in other cultures you have sacrificed others but the idea that because sacrifice is a necessary part of reality then the key that christianity offers is the the key is self-sacrifice so once the top the people at the top are there to love those at the bottom and those at the bottom submit to those at the top because those at the top are there to care for them like that's the pattern that christianity offers which which obviously doesn't derails all the time like it's an ideal pattern it goes off the rails all the time but it's something that we need to understand without that even the social justice woke culture can't hold because it's actually based in a weird perversion of that idea you know it's it's not a full one it's a kind of inverted weird perverted one but it needs christianity for it to hold i think um i think you're right about um the the sort of the self-satisfied the robin hood tales are in fact a great example of this um you know the robin hood being a product of the failing of the system and the fact that the the top is not considerate of the bottom and understanding of their the proper place that they have um that is a very very um bold way of uh showing i think no no i really think it is i i think it's excellent you know the yeah and the the fact that it all writes itself when the when the proper king returns that's i think it's a fantastic story um and i think there's a fantastic moral in that though that's the thing you know this yeah and so one of those one of my main points has been that the modern world let's say from the enlightenment has been a kind of weird d incarnation where in christianity demystifying things we offer like in christianity we offer this idea that this this vision of the hierarchy which is that you have you do a posit something above in the hierarchy which is which is has to be respected and and let's say submitted to but it's there to love and to care for that which is below that which is below also has its function because without it it's the body of the head let's say right the body of christ uh and so what the modern world seems to be is like a weird deincarnation where the body now wants to revolu have a revolution against the the head and the top the hierarch hierarchical part wants to separate from the body and to just be this elite that doesn't actually care or that that just presses down and pushes down on those that are below and and so people take one side or the other and they fight the other side people who want absolute order let's say the nazis are the the greatest example want to cut off the margin get rid of everything exceptional anything that doesn't fit in the categories we need to cut it off burn it and the others are saying no the exceptions are the rule like all this all the people at the bottom need to take rise up and take you know the what the king has illegitimately so it's a weird deformation of of the christian story it's a weird it's like an antichrist i guess that's how the christian way of talking about it where it's like these two extremes are happening and they're supposed to be together like that's how they're supposed to go but i like i i agree with you completely when you say um this has real world effects this manifests in the real world and i i mean it's everywhere like uh the the sort of uh the traditional uh christian protestant culture of the english-speaking world has produced the most enviable cultures in the world the political cultures as in ev everyone wants to live in an english-speaking country everyone is desperate to get into an english-speaking country because of the rule of law property rights and limited government these are these are like the one thing that england really got right is good governance and this has taken a long time and it's because of in my opinion geographic uh convenience uh the fact that we were you know an island and there weren't any major threats on this island so we had the space to be able to suddenly you know order the world and you know get an understanding with the people at the top but look we're not just here for your pleasure we are actually people on our own rights and then this you know you get this great agreement and uh and when you remove all of this the the understanding that there is a hierarchy to the world there will inevitably be a hierarchy to the world not just that there should be a hierarchy to the world when you get rid of all that look at what we have now you know we've got people who have you know delinquents who are depressed our intellectuals hate our own countries they hate the countries they were born and bred in the kids in some communities ridiculous amounts of crime and and suffering that is caused by the breakdown of these traditional hierarchical structures and so we can actually point to the effect of getting rid of this sort of pattern of life and say this is good you're not going to choose that for yourself who is going to choose to be some you know a you know an inner city kid who's now in a gang and has to carry a knife around like it happens in london all the time because of the breakdown of the family there's no father figures et cetera et cetera who's choosing that you know no one wants that that's awful it's a trap and it's actually we're actually in a good place you know this idea that you know you need to reach rock bottom before you can look up because 100 years ago or 150 years ago the project like the this kind of enlightenment project was still like in the 19th century this kind of rationalistic project was like because they didn't they didn't have the there were it was in the future still they were saying we're going to do this it's going to be great we're going to have beautiful star trek type societies where everybody is just scientifically super advanced and also everybody cares for each other and also loves each other and now we've come to the fruits of that way of thinking and now we can point to them and say okay so this is what you said a hundred years ago are do you still think you can hold this discourse now that we see the consequence you know and you can no now we're i would say that people exactly and so we if you want to advocate for a mythological point of view as being legitimate now's the time because it's like look at us like i don't know my third neighbor i don't know them what happened i don't live in this even live in the city you know i live in a suburb but i don't know my third neighbor like how is that possible it's crazy isn't it it's crazy the and the the sort of at the the atomization of people i don't think i i think that it's been vastly understated just how social cr human beings are and how necessary and but this is why i've i've gone straight back to aristotle because he deliberately said you know includes no you need a social life you are a man of the polis you're political you are familial you have to incorporate all of this so you know in a world where there's no obvious direction that seems to be a good start i've found and especially as an atheist who just can't go to religion i'm sorry i think there's a part of me that would the wishes i was religious you know because yeah i've seen the comfort that religious people have taken from their faith you know and i can see that it helps and it makes them feel better about bad things that happen in the world but i i just know that it's not for me yeah well i think maybe one of the things also that is that you might also have some idols like you might have your perception of what god is like you think god is this and so you're like i can't believe in this like i can't believe in some guy in the sky who tells me what to do it's like like that's that's your okay so your aunt maybe believed that who who dropped out of school and but you know thomas aquinas never believed that and the church fathers never believed that and sanger nissan said i'm actually the confessor they talked about the infinite and they used ontological categories to talk about god to talk about this idea of that which is beyond being and manifest itself in being and they these are the categories that the high theologians use and so sometimes we also we all like i said we have to always remember that there's an imagistic aspect of the story which is necessary and is important uh and has to reach all the way down to the most uneducated person but but that's that's something that maybe that that's a work that can be done in in each of us to break that down to break down those idols that that we've accepted like we've been told that this is what god is but that's that's not what the hot that's not what the great theologian thought god was so i i totally agree with you that now is the time to start pushing uh a mythological understanding of what a person is you know not not just the world but what a human being is and a human being is a collection of stories um and but the the the most difficult bit is going to i think be getting past the marxists the materialists who say uh well you're just a science denier you're you're making up things that have no bearing on reality and things like that how how are we going to address that well one of the things that i've been doing is trying to get down to the basics like really basics and so i i've made a video for example called the inevitability of ritual and i'm trying i tried to show people that if you look at the catholic mass or you look at i'm an orthodox myself you look at it at an orthodox ma an orthodox liturgy and you think it's stupid because it's all a lot of these people processing and bowing in front of each other and you know lifting up books and it's like what is going on right what is this like kind of nonsense thing that's going on but what i like to try to point to people is that we engage in those types of acts all the time every day right a handshake is no less a ritual act than uh than a procession and there are rules to how we engage with human beings we we face them you don't talk to the back of the head of someone you know and i tell people if you want to know that you are constantly engaged in ritual then try to do the opposite just once and see what happens like try to pick your nose in front of the person you're talking to try to uh to not let them speak at all let's say because there's a normal rhythm of speaking where it's like there's a pressure when you're speaking at some point there's a normal pressure to kind of stop and let the other person speak and those rhythms are there are liturgical rhythms they're ritual rhythms between between people and like i said handshakes saying hello it's non-stop we're our whole world is is even even like not you know not letting the toilet seat up like we have all these ritual behaviors that are just part of our everyday life and so i've been tending to just point to the lowest ones the ones that people can't avoid and say so so if you say like shaking hands you think that's real do you think that that's just a convention because if it's just a convention are you going to get rid of it and then what are you going to replace it with because you need a way to greet someone and shaking hands is actually a really good way to greet somebody it has all the it has all the symbolism in it you're reaching out with your hand you're showing you don't have anything to hurt the other person you're having a physical contact with that person and it's not too close not too far it's like a nice distance where you you're not like going up to strangers and hugging them or something strange like that and so it it actually is manifesting ritually what you're doing which is an encounter with a person and then it that scales up every single thing in a liturgy or in a mass is like that it's just that you don't have the capacity of of seeing it but it's it all of those things are completely logical and they're completely reasonable in the notion that in order for society to exist you need patterns and and those scale up to something like a sacred space right and so people who don't understand the church for example i tell them your house is made like a church your your house has to be made like a church you have a porch on the outside which is the narthex of the church which is a in between space and then you have like a place where you gather your living room then you have a more intimate space around your table and then you have your bedroom where you don't invite strangers into your bedroom and you you it's only you and your spouse to go and go into your bedroom and that's the same structure as a church you have the altar where it's just the priest you have the place where it's all the people greeting and then you have the north x where it's more open and less is and yeah absolutely and i think i think um i've been i've been reading a philosophy called john mackie australian liberal philosopher and i really like his conception of institutions uh institutions uh which is essentially what you're describing as rituals they institutions have a an often informal settle set of rules that everyone understands like the game of chess is an institution well i don't even have to be able to speak another language like you know i could sit down with a russian guy and bring out a chessboard and i know that he's going to move a pawn first and if he doesn't i'll you know i'll be able to point to that and he'll know why i've i've taken exception to him moving you know the queen or something you know without moving a pawn whatever it is you know there there's a there's a there's a there's a set of rules that may be formal maybe informal but everyone understands and agrees to and that's how we can join together in activities by these shared rules so like you say you know the the liturgical mass might might look silly where they've got the incense sensors and all this sort of stuff but it's only silly if you don't accept that people are bound together by these rituals it's only silly like that and again the the thing that drives me crazy is that the very same people say well that's silly we'll see like i know zulu warriors jumping up and down in the air and say oh isn't this a beautiful expression of a native culture well so is this whatever we've been doing for the past thousand years is also our native culture that binds us all together you know come on give us a break and moreover what do you want to replace it with you know this sort of like oh well we're universalist now there's no such thing as like western culture now now we're all universal it's like okay but i don't want to be you know i actually want to be a particular thing that i can take pride in that i can work towards if i do the rituals then i build the thing because a thing is defined by what it is as much as what it's not and so you know if i can't put those building blocks down then i can't build on top of them and we never have the the great church i suppose you could describe it as that we're building in each in our own lives if you don't have any identity at all and you just have a weird universal mush then you become potential for another identity and it's really like it's a this is the the idea it's almost in evolutionary terms it's like if you're too generalist in terms of your evolutionary practice then then a specialist is going to come in like a knife and is going to slice your thing up and you're going to take it from you and that's just how it just that's just a pattern of reality it's not a it's not a it's not something i want or not want it's just that's just how it works well any anyone with a strong normative view of the world that can just reject you know our universalist enlightenment view that we've been reduced to uh will look appealing as well they'll look strong i can build something i can bring people together you know you will salam five times a day to allah or whatever it is you know what whatever whatever alien identity is arrived it'll it'll be attractive because what what's the alternative we're offering you sludge we're offering you no progress we're offering you nothing you know anyone else will come in boldly and view this as right for the taking and the thing about you you mentioned marxist materials before marxist materialists are actually extremely religious yes their their storytelling is very religious the only difference is that it's upside down i was talking about this recent i did a video on monsters where i was showing how karl marx talks about these like kind of uh earth monsters right the pucks and the the robin goodfellows and all these kind of earth monsters and he sees them as like agents in his revolution he's like he he understands that the the ghouls and the demons and the and these like these these kind of monsters of the edge they're actually images of what he wants to accomplish and bringing those and having those take over the world karl marx was was a very very uh mythological writer it's just that it was a satanic like a satanic vision it was an upside-down vision and it was totally false i mean just the very nature of all of human history being the story of class conflict that's that's a mythos right there and it's not a true one either which is really interesting it's not like that you know um and then you get the sort of like almost well not even almost the religious veneration of lenin and the the way that um lenin developed the sort of first um sort of marxist cult of personality that lenin could do no wrong he became and he i mean london himself hated this cult of personality this was not i've just finished a biography on him actually which is good timing actually but you know he he hated this cult of personality but he couldn't escape it because it's everywhere it's just part of human nature and one of the one of the things that i've noticed again i've been reading a lot about 20th century dictators in the last month or two and every single one of them you get the same pattern in in lenin or stalin or mao and then you you can match this same pattern back through the centuries you know you go you know right back to like the persian empire where there's this common view where okay we're all suffering now but if only stalin knew if only mao knew if only lenin if only the the the king of kings knew he would come and help us with our suffering you know this this assumption that the guy at the top is looking out for you is a very natural thing for the people at the bottom and it's really sad in the case of the 20th century communist dictators because they did not care about you at all yeah they they had no thought to you at all yeah and it was really a failure of hierarchy because hierarchy is layered it the idea that because we have this idea that's we're talking about how negative people view hierarchy we have this idea that hierarchy is like this horrible dictator at the top and then everybody at the bottom that's a modern vision the idea of a leader above and everybody else below that's a total modern vision a normal hierarchy has levels of of of management at all these different levels and so let's say in a normal world if even if there's a king the king can't do without his aristocracy and his aristocracy can't do without their like knights that they've that they that are vassals to them and those knights can't do without the peasants that are that are subject to them and so the king has to be careful he's always playing a line where if he alienates his aristocracy too much they'll kill him they'll just kill him or they'll or they'll or they'll they'll start to fight you know with with him or they'll fight amongst themselves or whatever so hierarchy actually is always both separation and the means of unity and that's what people struggle so sometimes it can be it can become more means of separation but then there usually tends to be if you do that too much it's normally going to come back where it's going to then start to act as a as a unifying principle because or else it's going to shatter i i really like um i it's also like a method of definition as well um you know it defines things into existence that give people meaning and inclusion but i i i find it the the way that you put that the aristocrats will kill them that's exactly true i mean that's what happened in the english civil war and people now find it strange that we would want uh that we that you know the the english of the time would bring in charles's son charles ii to be king again you know that that seems strange well you've just had a revolution you've just got rid of the king why are you installing a new king it's like well there should be a king that's why you know that's what they thought you know in the 17th century you know the the idea that you could you know go without the king that's that's very alien idea that's a very modern idea you know that just wouldn't apply back then um and also the king like the king acted as a trans national uh person like that's also the emperor like the idea of the byzantine emperor for example he acted as it as a transnational figure because it's difficult to have different nations or different tribes of different groups uh be together and it's difficult when it's just like one tribe that say that is that that has always has leaders but in the notion of the byzantine emperor for example the byzantine emperor was was sometimes armenian sometimes greek would have you know different people could access it was messy and violent and and obviously there was a lot of backstabbing happening but once the emperor was there then he acted like i said as someone who was beyond the different national identities and everybody could kind of identify with and i feel like that let's say the the royalty in england in the uk has played that role to a certain extent where it's like okay you know the scots and the irish like we all would disagree but yeah we still like the the monarchy because the monarchy is is actually none of us it's actually a mix of all of us it's like a joining of all these different identities because they all have these these bloodlines that are that have kind of joined together and so they're not one or the other they're like these something above above the national identities and so we can we can pledge allegiance to them still kind of not like each other but it's still acting as a binding agent for all of us at the same time yeah it gives it gives us a sort of unifying moral groundwork to to stay on you know um but right uh jonathan this has been an amazing conversation i've really enjoyed it um yeah i'd really like uh to do this again sometime if that's all right well yeah any time no fantastic because i'm i'm still like developing this sort of like secular view of the um the mythological because i like you say i it's a part of reality it's a part of the human condition there's no questioning it's got to be established the enlightened and this is the thing i think the enlightenment was wrong about humans are not they can't purely be rational they can't pretend like they have a you know universal understanding of the world and everything around them it's it's you know we've we've got to accept our limitations as people but um but anyway thank you again so much for joining me really appreciate it so if you if you want like you can check i did
