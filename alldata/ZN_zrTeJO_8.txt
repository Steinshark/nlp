a hundred days ago i didn't think this was possible a hundred videos in a hundred days daily uploading [Music] it's an absolute insane project looking back it's even more insane than i thought yeah i wanted to talk about it explain to you guys what you can get out of it if you decide to go daily because i realize there's no real resource for people thinking about doing this or wondering you know what are the benefits if any is it just like you know a proven formula for creator burnout like so many of us think what can you get out of it what did i get out of it you know i've made over a little over 100 videos i think i've uploaded a little bit less but it all averages out to about 100 videos in 100 days totally bizarre that we're here and i've got a lot of thoughts because it was surprising in the ways that it was great and also in the ways like oh i didn't expect this part to suck so much so to be clear like one of the reasons i got in was yes can i do this could i is it possible um because you know i've been a monthly uploader in the past like on coffee break i made a video a month and i couldn't imagine making more than that because it was like so taxing and one of the reasons it was taxing actually was i had really bad writer's block no idea is ever good enough like i would spend probably two weeks out of the four weeks um just trying to think of an idea what's the idea what's the idea and some of that was productive some of it was just unproductive writer's block that is unhelpful and i wanted to cure myself of that very explicitly and i've never forgotten one podcast that malcolm gladwell had with tim ferriss where he talks about the cure to writer's block let's take a listen together shall we because this is pro number one of going daily you run into writer's block uh if if so how does that manifest and what do you what do you do i don't you know i worked for 10 years at a newspaper and if that experience teaches you anything it's that you can't have writer's block i mean you quite literally can't i mean the story will be you'll start the story at 10 30 and it's due at 4 00 or 4 30 or whatever back in those days there was hard deadlines so you can't have i mean it's nothing unthinkable i mean you know the luxury and if you went to your bosses and you said i'm blocked on the story they would look at you like you were insane you know like take off your beret you've done your poetry so it's like there's not even an issue so i mean i i did used to have these issues and then i went to the washington post and you get cured in a hurry of any pretensions you have about your writing that idea stuck in me for years i mean i probably heard this when this when it first came out four years ago and i had always thought i have that problem i have writer's block and i want to cure it and daily uploading i would tell any anybody creative person struggling with any kind of uh you know pretensions about themselves you will cure yourself i i can say absolutely for sure probably forever i am cured of writer's block having done this project now the second thing is you'll get also rid of your perfectionism which might sound like the same thing and they do intersect a lot but what i find is that um people even people who do make stuff they're so afraid they're so afraid of putting out something that's not perfect and that's actually a real really big detriment to like their overall improvement because look creative work it's honestly it's a lot like a sport you just get better at it over time and can you imagine if like a soccer player was refused to kick the ball because he said no no i don't want to kick it imperfectly it's like no that's actually how you get better at it and the reality is you never learn what sticks until you throw a lot of the things at the wall here's a little quote i enjoy about a perfectionism perfectionism may look good in his shiny shoes but he's a little bit of an  and no one invites him to their pool parties it's a nice way of saying perfectionism looks great is terrible for creative work now the third thing i'm going to say that you get out of going daily is that the rhythmic nature of uploading gets you out of your head about how the video is doing one big problem that a lot of new creators new artists new musicians have is they look at like especially their starting work as like everything has to be a masterpiece and the reality is it won't all be a masterpiece and one thing that like just getting into a rhythm does is it kind of uh gives you the option to decouple yourself from like how did this video do how did this video do was it the greatest video i've ever made it's got to be the greatest video i've ever made otherwise i won't upload like going daily just gets you into this rhythmic swing where it's like honestly i can't pay attention to yesterday's video because hey we got to work on today's like that's it done finished hey if last video was a bomb hey i got another swing today if today's video was great doesn't matter i gotta swing tomorrow but there are problems okay it look don't let anyone tell you that like hey just go daily man it's it's like the same thing as you know making weekly content it's not i mean all creators who go daily will tell you and even right now like i am for a while there i i think this was the first weekend i took off in four months and that really can mess with you and i think one of the problems is is that like in this hustle in this like pursuit of being better at what you do you can end up sacrificing your longevity by getting burnt out early on and i think casey neistat's a great example of this of how you know you can be doing very well going daily and still burn out because you just have zero time to recharge and not only that every moment of your life is like devoted to it you're just obsessed with like the next video you know what i mean all i was thinking about all the time was my work 24 7. so when i wasn't doing my work i was pretending like the time we hung out we first met you came by my studio all i was thinking about then is like okay how do i parlay this into content for my episode for today yeah and it wasn't me that doesn't mean i wasn't excited to meet you or happy to be around you but the reality was that was going on yeah and then you start to push that your kids like come on hang out with my kids all how can i make this moment something vloggable hang on my wife how can i make this vloggable without her knowing and you start to go crazy and it makes those experiences also pretty hollow exactly yeah and then it starts to make you hollow now for this next con let's go back to the board okay uh or sorry the conspiracy board here guys please okay because the next thing i want to tell you about you should know you will have to put out videos that you know are not your best work and it's not easy to do if you're someone who takes pride in their work um and it's not because you're trying to give people bad things it's literally that's the best you can do in 24 hours now the opposite is also true that you'll have days where you just like you make a great piece of content in 24 hours that you can like stand behind and you think is as good as what you could make in in a month like i mean i look at my my video on james arthur ray where i interview uh the grieving mother of the of the her daughter that james ray killed in a sweat lodge that interview had me in tears and i still i would hang my ad on that interview any day of the week i you know we have the j mazzini investigation that is an amazing serialized arc but not everything can be like that exciting that level of content and that's just the reality and you know something that i think of i was thinking about stephen king he's one of my favorite authors you know like he wrote one of my all-time favorite books lisey's story and i wish i could tell you that all of stephen king's books are great but they're not if you've ever looking through steven's back catalog dude some of them okay just going to be honest honestly steven some suck but the reality is that you know when you i later read his book on writing you learn that oh this is a pro this is a process sometimes you feel inspired sometimes you have all the great ideas sometimes you don't it's the same guy but part of the work is just like pumping out content and not being overly judgmental about is this the best work i've ever done or is this just more practice for me to write my next inspired work and not everyone has to live by that by the way i think there are a lot of people who they only ever want to let great things into their catalog and i think that's a whole content strategy i think that's fine it's much more like the george rr martin model where it may take you much longer to get a book series out like like your epic work you know and you may want to take years and years to do that but at the end of the day it is just a different frame you will see these like two content styles butt heads from time to time even in one interview i think george r martin explicitly just asked like how do you write so fast to stephen king and i think the answer is they just have two different formulas for their own work is there anything that you've always wanted to ask me yes yes there is something i want to ask you all right how do you write so many books so fast i actually think that layered within this like hilarious exchange is a really deep divide between like two approaches to making stuff if all you ever wanna make is like perfect things you will be like george rr martin wondering how the people who are more willing to just like sort of grind out every day how they get so much stuff done and i think both are valid ways of approaching the creative process but i think i find myself more comfortable with the stephen king model just personally now the last thing we're going to have to go to the board for ladies and gentlemen we're gonna have to go uh to the board to tell you about because this is the sad truth of daily uploads for those of you who wanna know and this is probably the part that will disqualify a lot of people and probably the reason that i'm going to kind of cut back on daily vlogging or daily vlogging daily uploading a bit which is that prepare to never see your family okay that is a rule of making daily content you just don't have time this is an interview between pete holmes and jon stewart uh obviously the famous host of the daily show where they talk about this he represents sort of the daily grind by the way i just want to know how you balance an actual life with this mania pete you you really don't that's that's the secret here is uh surrender you're on your way to being a shell of a man all i can say is welcome to the team it's a funny way of putting a hard truth which is that um a lot of the youtubers that i've seen go daily i mean it is like it's hard on them it's harder than family because you're just non-stop crying you're just non-stop uh which is why today i'm telling you guys that this is this is not forever i'm gonna just my new commitment to you is that i will make videos when i feel like making them and it will probably be pretty frequently because i have a blast doing this i just and i love like just being able to get out my my thoughts regularly but i'm not gonna be this like youtube's fun i like you guys don't love you i love my family and that's and my friends and all that kind of stuff so for me when i look at this and i think about daily uploads i think that's a part of it that's a part of the the dark bargain is that you know you get a lot done you're incredibly you can be incredibly creative you get to iterate through ideas by the way something we didn't talk about a good thing is like you get better at this thing of like making videos so much faster i i don't know i didn't leave with this by the way it's like one of the greatest pros then if you had just made uh you know a video week of video month like this is you if you're daily you're just constantly taking more swings at the uh at the proverbial algorithm than anyone else is and i think that's you know you learn a lot but it's a dark bargain voice so yeah that's what i've learned from daily uploading for the past 100 days starting now i'm taking weekends off and that's it if i can get seven videos done in five days that's great if not sorry like this is i'm in it for the marathon and i don't want to be you know like um casey neistat talking about burnout and like i think he's changing careers but i mean the reality of burnout is once you're burned out like that's you can't really it's hard to get back in the saddle so for now i think uh yeah maybe a few less videos maybe a few more videos on coffee break thanks for watching and i will see you guys tomorrow wake up and smell the coffee
