okay so today on the show we've got a really special guest i'm sitting here today with jossie um jossey is a software engineer uh primarily front-end web development and he also runs a youtube channel that i highly highly recommend you guys check out um and maybe you can to tell a little bit more about that yeah yeah definitely um thank you for having me on the podcast this is actually my first time being on a podcast so um this is really cool i'm really excited um i really appreciate the opportunity to share my experiences but um i'm a front-end dev um i have experience in full stack development that's most of my experience i interned for three summers at a company called highland software based out of cleveland ohio and it's a enterprise content management company um but it had like us it always has had like a startup type feel because it's only about like 20 something years old so they have like kind of like a startup kind of culture um so i had a lot of experiences worked on some really cool um projects um and then before that um or during those internships i majored in computer science at ohio university i graduated with a computer science degree in 2018 so now i'm working as a front-end dev at another company and working at progressive in digital as a front-end dev which has been really cool it's really really fast-paced i get thrown on a lot of different projects you could imagine this big of a company that is um so that's been great and then i'm making content yeah yeah you're making some really great content uh when did you why did you start this youtube channel and when did you start it yeah um actually when i started my channel well actually we talked a little bit earlier about one of my friends that lives in seattle um his name's justin he's actually the one that inspired me to become a youtuber i never really thought about youtube as like an actual like like career or like even side hustle or like actual like you know lifestyle channels um i i only went to youtube for like you know sports highlights when i was playing football or like you know khan academy and like learning how to program for the most part but then i started my youtube channel he inspired me when we interned together at highland so i decided to start a channel in 2017 and my channel was just mostly about like my life really um just like random things here and there i was trying to get a grasp on what actually inspired me because i never was like someone who had a camera in their hands so i didn't know really anything about videography or on photography but fast forward um to 2018 the summer of 2018 i did a day in the life of a software engineer video and it exploded like my channel when i graduated college i had like 400 subscribers and that was literally like two years and a month ago and now i'm at over like 41 or 42 000 which has been uh which has been a huge blessing it's been great but really that video took off um and before that video i actually did a day in the life of a computer science major and that video did well so i got kind of a grasp on like what niche i should probably pursue because youtube is so saturated um yeah and then those videos took off specifically a day in a life and people come to me for softball stuff now that's awesome that's a start thanks i love that um you know you did a day in the life of a software developer and then when people responded to it you decided to make content that was um helping them as opposed to just reflecting it like as you probably could have continued to do episodes like that but instead you were like i can use this audience to help people that were struggling did you is there a reason that you did that did you maybe have some struggles in university so yeah so i definitely did have struggles in university um but before we get to that um i got really inspired by really three channels which was my yuko she's a she's a phenomenal software engineer and and youtuber um jarvis johnson and life of luba i was watching those three um live in you know the bay area and you know worked in silicon valley and that really inspired me because i was like they had a lot of different like videos that i could relate to and then i figured hey i can make videos as well um especially since i was literally fresh out of school i thought it would be a good time and yeah i definitely did i computer science is really hard i have a video about like how i almost quit um and that happened like early in my life um curriculum because it was new um a really tough professor that went to stanford as my first professor so being exposed to that for the first time it was really really tough i actually have to withdraw that class it's a really funny story and i had to take like coastal kayaking to um get enough credits to keep my scholarship um because i withdrew from that class because i didn't want to get a bad grade you know freshman year second semester so yeah i had a lot of struggles um not only with uh you know computer science but just like you know applying internships you know what i mean like big tech companies i've done so many you know interviews with like you know i've done interviews with amazon and google and facebook and pinterest and um so i i jarvis johnson had a video about like every software engineering interview ever i thought that was really funny and that kind of inspired me with the um uh five things i wish i knew before uh studying computer science where i kind of had like a skit um because it's so relatable you know coding interviews and and just being a dev you know it's there's a culture behind it yeah it's like you don't realize how much of your experiences are shared amongst other people until somebody kind of puts it in a video and you're like oh that happens to me all the time yeah yeah it just it just you just laugh it makes you smile um because as like you know the dev and like the software engineering community we have like our own experiences when it comes to like the challenges of undergrad which is you know undergrad is really tough unless you already have like experience where you're just like a genius um and then like what they like what companies expect of us like interview rides like most people they interview for a job right they may look up the company go over their resume and then they go into the interview and they get asked questions about their experience like the star method but as a software engineer you want to work for like a major tech company you're probably going to be getting a coding challenge before they even give you a call yeah so yeah definitely and um yeah it's it's crazy like all those experiences are just really shared and it it also kind of sucks a lot because uh like you said computer science graduate or degree can be really difficult i remember there was specifically a few times where i was out with friends and i got a mark on my phone and i looked at it and it would be like 30 and i was like oh i just don't want to be here anymore and i would just go home it's like i don't want to even be out with friends you know uh because it would just it would take so much out of you and then on top of that on top of your difficult degree it's like you have to study full time yeah for interviews and uh you've got like you're applying to like a a bunch of companies you get rejected from a bunch of them which also feels bad and you finally get the interview and it's like they're they're just hammering you with questions it's like another exam right yeah it's exhausting i mean i will say we are really like blessed and fortunate in the dev world because we get a lot of perks like granted it was exhausting like um like i made it to like a final round of interviews when i was like in college with it with this tech company and it was an exhausting process right like a 12 hour window to like finish this coding challenge and then a phone coding challenge and then they fly you out to san francisco um but the nice thing is when you like get the opportunity to make it to like the on site you get treated really nice like you get free food you get a really nice plane ticket um you get a chance to stay in a really freaking nice hotel and there aren't too many other like um majors that get that opportunity because like i got my degree was um my curriculum or my degree is inside of engineering department so we were like integrated with mechanical civil electrical engineers all the time chemical engineers um and the way we were treated as like software engineers is just very very different so it is a challenge but um it's totally worth it which is why i like to make these videos because so many students are like oh i just want to give up i'm like look it's better to get that you know two point something passing whatever you get in a computer science degree opposed to like doing something that isn't as difficult you know or is it lucrative you know doesn't have as many opportunities and getting like really good grades because a lot of companies just need talent and if you aren't you're just not set on working for like a major tech company and you just like want to get this degree and get a nice job that will more than likely happen right yeah um i i couldn't agree more like you took the words right out of my mouth there um i was basically on the point of that uh it's so lucrative once you get through it and it's just you just have to push through it and then it's it's like really great after that right so we all know it's difficult we both went through it uh but it's just a matter of pushing through and then that's why we kind of generate content to support people to get through it because once you're on the other side you're you look back and you go oh i'm glad i did that yeah oh it was so worth it like now that i look back at it i wouldn't it's funny because um when you get a comp sci degree and like engineering college and like specifically the accredited ones and the reason why i say credit is because they um make you do more so like i've had to take a lot of math and a lot of science um and it was such a pain back then i didn't have any really cool electives i remember wanting to do like ios um software engineering and they they just didn't have that as an option in my university um so really the only options were like databases artificial intelligence um data mining like bioinformatics um and i remember it was such a pain like some of the things that we were doing like greedy algorithms and like random forests it was nuts when i look back at it i'm like man i learned so much you don't as a computer science major you don't have to become a developer like you could um you could go into uh you could like your master's degree or phd you could go into study you could become a machine you could do machine learning data science you know consulting analytics and that's because the curriculum like puts you through so much and i remember my professors told me that like our job is going to make you a software engineer our job is to make you computer scientists and right that really resonates with me now when i look back at it i'm like you know what i wouldn't change a thing because i learned so much um and if i want to pursue another career that's like within tech embedded systems or whatever um something else like i could because of the experiences that you know we've got in college yeah yeah and i really also resonate with that thing you said there about how um you know that their job is to make you a computer scientist because i remember i had that aha moment also in university my teacher said something similar what he said was um i'm a computer scientist and i hate computers that's what he said and i was like what but then when you think about it you're right like he's he taught algorithms right so oh yeah what he does is is kind of discuss big o of n notation and like running through algorithms like that so he is a computer scientist and he doesn't like computers he doesn't even use them very much right right right because um um there's because computer science i think the i think computer science likes came from like mathematics right so it's in a lot of mathematical like departments and that's a funny story too because i didn't know what major i wanted to pursue when i came out of high school because i didn't watch like people on youtube i just like really applied to like different engineering majors at different colleges when i look back at it i'm like man there are universities i could have applied to that didn't have an engineering department had a computer science department and um you know larger cities where i probably could have had even more opportunities because i went to a school like in like rural ohio um luckily it was big enough to get like you know a lot of the a lot of companies there however i did see um the benefits students received when they went to um you know universities and study computer science within a really nice city so like one way to land that like dream job or at least get a good job in a really really cool city is to try to attend a university within the city you want to live in because those recruiters and like hiring managers are more likely to hire you they they want to hire you because they want to keep the talent within the city like right yeah definitely yeah i mean i see that all the time uh there's um you know university of washington right here i know that we have a lot of stuff going on at microsoft and amazon's next door too right so there's definitely a bunch of recruitment that happens right there yeah because it you know when you're like applying on linkedin or indeed sometimes it's just like a resume stack and i've had way more success being able to like explain my experience to a recruiter opposed to them scanning a resume that kind of has to be you know templated perfectly for them to even respond i remember even being in an interview where someone asked me would i be able to adapt to like the culture in like new york city or like not culture the lifestyle because it's so different from really everywhere else in america um and i was like man i never thought about that i was like yeah no definitely because you know new york is really cool i'd love to live there one day but i'm like man i wonder if like that might have played a role like what if um you know me and someone else were like at the top you know one of the top candidates but that person lived in new york city you don't have to worry about them adapting to the lifestyle so they choose them right that's actually a really good point i'd never considered that um i actually have a funny story about that so i i interviewed for a place in new york too and i got the exact same question um i don't know have you ever watched the office yeah oh yeah multiple times through yeah same here right so um in the first few seasons when jim applies to this job in new york he goes for an interview and he gets asked that question in the interview and what his answer is is like oh there's like an energy to the city or whatever i remember being asked the question i gave them the same answer honey it really is though it's a really really cool place um it's interesting because there's a lot of tech out there because everyone thinks about like silicon valley um but the bay area really the bay area and where you live in seattle but new york has a lot of really cool things and all the big companies are there too definitely definitely i i'm hoping to to go to new york at some point also yeah so uh let's let's go to your experiences so um you did talk about your internships but let's let's go through a little bit more and talk about like what you did and what stacks you worked on yeah yeah so um so when i first started interning i got my first internship when i was a freshman so it was right after um freshman year and i didn't have much programming experience so my i wasn't in the best like heads i won't say headspace but basically what happened was i withdrew from that intro to computer science class right and i knew nothing about industry and i didn't know that a lot of companies could care less like about how well you're doing in school once they hire you it's so weird so what happened was i remember i whipped you from that class it's so funny thinking about this i called like my hiring i call like my manager or recruiter i was like oh my goodness i withdrew from my intro to computer science class like do you all still want me to work for you when i look back at that that's so funny because a lot of people that are in um within software development aren't even like they didn't even get computer science majors um and one thing i like alluded to before in a video is that most of the computer science majors are usually like the younger pool of um employees because you know it's hard to like jump right into you know software development without experience um with working whereas like if you worked at a company or other companies and then learn how to code you have experience right um but yeah so i started the internship and i remember like wanting to switch majors i wanted to switch to industrial systems engineering because i figured i could work like as a consultant um because there are people that went to ohio state that worked at highland that were industrial systems engineers i worked at consultants as consultants um but then i actually shadowed consulting and in project management and i was so bored i remember i literally because they're like bikes to get the different buildings like on like my break during shadowing i would like literally go grab my laptop and i would go like work on like the project i was working on so that first year i was exposed to c sharp um wpf with c sharp so um i i did a lot of front end development sounds weird to say front end development with wpf but um basically like wpf is like the xaml language kind of looks like um it kind of looks like html for those who are listening and don't aren't familiar with it but um it's a way to bind like a view to um a model within c sharp so i had experience so i experienced that and that was really hard because c sharp was like c sharp is kind of complex and i didn't have the most confidence because i withdrew from that course right um but to make a long story short i got exposed to front end development and i actually had i sat in a pod with other interns so they were really nice they were really helpful they were all older than me one works i think at uber now that was actually my mentor um she was really nice she helped me out a lot um and they were like explaining like concepts to me and helping me with like you know logic that i didn't understand but i mostly focused on funding because i didn't have that much experience so then like this light bulb went off i was like wait a second front-end development is like a thing like i can just continue this computer science major and then i can become a front-end developer like when i graduate from college like and i don't have to deal with like data structures algorithms right i don't have to worry about you know binary trees but you don't do a lot of that anyways a lot of those things fundamentals you do in schools just to understand what's going on underneath the hood and when i started to understand that i was like okay i can just get through this major i got experience i'll stick with it so then the next summer i did more or less the same thing but since i had more experience i um did more back-end development so i started working like on the server side of things and i worked with another intern it was a team of two um and my internships gave me really good experience because they were really fun highland's like a great place to work it's always like in the top 100 on forbes list um in my top five here in cleveland they call it the google of cleveland um the model is like what they make isn't fun but working there is fun there's like slides and video games you play basketball so um literally i played basketball we would play like knockout we had a group of like 20 25 interns i'll play knockout we'd hang out it was really really fun um amazing amazing experience um so yeah i got exposure to c sharp and i worked in like a real dev team right so i worked like with um i didn't work with a scrum master but we worked in agile right for our project management to keep track of our stories and have some transparency with our product owner stakeholders and then we have like quality assurance testers as well so you got like the real you got real experience only difference is you weren't working in production code right um but uh so that that the second summer was great because i worked with a really really really great product owner that acted as if he was talking with customers and saying hey this is what they needed so um the first project uh that first summer was like an educational project even though i worked in healthcare no idea why um but the company was a lot smaller than so a lot of times you know you can work on different things in the second year i actually worked on the healthcare product for quality assurance test testers some documents not really fun but one thing that highland did which was great was they knew the product wasn't fun you know business of business but um you get exposed to a lot of you get exposed to cutting edge technology which is great there's no oh we do it this way it's no what do you think we should do why should you why you know what programming language what should we use what framework should we use okay why should we use that and that gives you you feel like you're actually influencing the project like what you say matters and that matter and that's so important as a developer like to actually have input into like what you're developing um and then fast forward to the last summer actually was like an intern uh team lead with two other interns that i like mentored and led and that was a really fun experience because i got exposed to web development and we created this web accessibility tool that scanned other websites to determine if they comply with wcag standards accessibility standards for people who are visually impaired that was really fun and i fell in love with webb and i've been doing web ever since then that was the summer of 2017. so that was my last internship right wow that's awesome i i there's so much in in that journey there that i love about it um i love how you kind of found your footing and found what you liked uh in in front-end development and realized that even though you didn't like everything about computer science it's still the degree in the the career choice for you and i guess what my question coming out of that would be is if i'm like a student um how do i know what type of technology is gonna get me excited to come to work every day like you found your footing and front end right yeah i got really lucky because i worked at in a company that was the culture was amazing right everyone was willing to help you worked on um really cool projects like even if the end solution isn't fun the way you built it was fun um and also you i was able to like have research time like okay i like front end development so let me build a website portfolio so the the best way to figure out like what stack you're interested in or what programming language you're interested in is really like try to get an internship in um software engineering and the title will be like software developer or software engineer which basically means you're going to be working like full stack more than likely um and if you experience full stack you'll get a better understanding of how to build a solution from end to end and you'll you'll also um experience uh what part of the stack you enjoy the most so you'll be able to figure it out that's how i was able to figure out you know what i don't want to do full stack development let me focus on friend and development or um you know sometimes i do like doing full stack development it really sorry it really depends on um what what product you're working on or what team you're working on and when it comes to internships but then on the side i would say ex um try to work on personal projects right so like if you're interested in full stack development then try to build a like functional website that actually has some like user interaction like even if it's a simple form you know to understand like data structures and objects and how they relate to um or how they bind to the data and how you can save user data basically create read update delete do those tutorials those will help you figure out like if you really like building a whole solution or if you really want to focus on you know the styling of a website or or application right okay um so what uh what other advice do you have uh for students right now yeah my advice is to um figure out what industry you're interested in pursuing sometimes we focus so much on the language the programming language we don't think about actually building a portfolio that relates to the type of jobs you want to pursue so let's say you're really interested in the financial sector what i would do is i would actually look up the programming languages that these financial companies like you know chase bank citibank um you know any of these banks you know goldman sachs or investment banks fintech all those things you know blockchain all if you're interested in any of those things um figure out what programming languages those jobs require as a basic qualification become really good at it and then start building a portfolio that can relate to that industry so if you're really interested in the financial sector then build like a really really nice like immersive calculator app you know or experience that you can actually put like in the little url that says hey you know you have any urls you want to you want to link to but you can create an application right a simple application right um like a calculator or a currency converter and do it in a and create it in a language that um these these companies these specific companies are looking for and that way you can actually show hey i already built this i know this language i'm ready you know so then they'll you'll they'll be more inclined to interview you because i will say there are a lot of tech jobs but they're really competitive so you want to separate yourself and a lot of times i know i'm being a little biased because i'm a front-end dev but one way to separate yourself is through visuals so like through a personal portfolio that maybe you design through squarespace or you build yourself that's how you can really separate yourself so you can catch the eye of the recruiter or the hiring manager yeah definitely um it's funny that you said uh currency converter because that was one of my projects when i was in school so yeah yeah i definitely made one of those um but i i also made like really horrible ui so like you said if you're gonna do it right make a nice ui and yeah uh if you're gonna like include the github or something you'd have yourself yeah right but like definitely include a screenshot um if you don't expect people to be like pulling your code and then running it you know right i see that a lot a lot with it's just a github with a readme that's like oh this is how you install it and i'm like i'm really going to install this project just to see what it looks like yeah yeah like github is great like you actually really need that i can't believe i forgot that but github is really really valuable because then you can also show them that you understand version control which is a skill set another skills that you need as a dev not just programming but actual version control um but yeah the github is great and like when you build that application even if it's simple make you can make it more complex right so like for the currency converter you can you if you're new to programming you can actually like look up the equations for the currency conversions right um and you can you can hard code it for the most part right um but if you you know have more experience and you want to do full stack development or um you know just web development in general then my recommendation is understand how you know node.js works right like understand how to launch like a local server then then you can like create a file that's like have like a json file with like this data and with node.js is really nice because you can launch like a local server you don't have to like actually ping anything externally but then that's the next step like if you you understand how to do that then actually hang an api and try to like subscribe to that data and then populate it and then if you can populate the data in a really appealing way that's gold because not only you can build the whole solution like you understand the backend but you also can build a really nice like immersive um experience yeah definitely i couldn't agree more um all right so i don't want to take up too much of your time here i really appreciate you uh joining us today so is there is there any last tips that you have for students before we get going here yeah i'd say um don't focus too much on your gpa i know that's hard to believe because like you know as a comp time major you may have like a lower degree than like some of your friends and other majors so you get a little bit disappointed maybe in your grades but understand how difficult your curriculum is and understand that it's just as viable if not more viable to actually have personal projects um because anyone can regurgitate information from a professor but these companies actually need creative you know they need people who are creative that can actually like solve problems that haven't been solved before so and then if you do have internship experiences you don't even have to put your resume your gpa on your resume i stopped putting my gp on my resume like after my first year and it never came up so don't let school beat you up keep keep pursuing um like my grandpa says keep on keeping on um so keep on keeping on and um keep being like creative like pursue that creative route yeah thank you so much for joining us today josie yeah no problem thanks for having me on
