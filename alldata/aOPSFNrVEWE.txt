ladies and gentlemen who would you consider to be the greatest chess player of all time and please don't say me because that is the obvious answer on a serious note most people say Magnus Carlson Gary Kasparov Bobby Fisher other people have other opinions and they're very strong opinions and they get very upset when you say but those people are not in front of a camera talking to 4.16 million subscribers at this very moment uh and uh Gary Kasparov is very prominently a number one number two greatest chess player of all time but Gary Kasparov is now 60 years of age at the time of recording this video and that's not ancient in day-to-day life but it's pretty ancient for chess and he's been retired for many years your brain gets slower your body can't you know keep up but every year we get Gary Kasparov back in action in Saint Louis Missouri and he is playing in the chess 960 or Fisher random Champion Showdown against players like Hikaru Nakamura Fabiano caruana Wesley so you name it they are there in this video I'm going to show you an incredible move an incredible sequence that Kasparov implemented against Hikaru and a couple of other incredible games that he played this is one of the goats and we don't see him in competitive settings very often which is why this video is very special and I would like to show it to all of you uh here we go I that that's that that was the introduction uh in this video we're going to see a game against Hikaru we're going to see a game against Wesley so and we are going to see a game against Ray Robson one of the best American chess players uh that uh that that competes um what do we start with let's start with the course of action throughout the day Benji my my he he's we got a little baby dog here you can't really see him but now that I've addressed him you have to come up come on come on oh boy there you go yes can you not be annoying this video what do you think oh sit over there go down all right let me record and then I'll take you out for a walk this is what my life looks like so chess 960 all you have to know 960 possible starting positions the king must be between the Rooks you Castle to that side you Castle to that side if the squares are free and the Bishops need to be on opposite color that's it Wesley so Begins the game with E4 let's look at it from Gary's perspective Pawn to E5 so far so good obviously developing is and there there he is Benji down I listen man thank you very good B3 so clearly Wesley wants to put the bishop here and he would like to potentially Castle on the queen side we have D6 Bishop B2 the players are developing their their pieces and and Kasparov does something very principled advances where he's uh taking you know as much space as possible right so F5 everything is defending over there and he's going to open things up potentially and there we go did you see that long Castle this Rook is responsible for castling Queen side that Rook would be responsible for castling the other way so as long as this frees up Wesley has committed his King but Gary Kasparov was one of the most feared attacking players ever like Kasparov was just an unbelievable chess player and now he has a Target right so the move G5 is just a pretty clear indication that Kasparov is just trying to take space where Wesley has not claimed it it also means that Kasparov is not going to be castling this way he will probably Castle on this side and try to dominate on this side of the board Wesley has already committed his King G3 now light squared weaknesses but you do open up your Bishop Gary immediately Knights to D4 now you cannot take this with white because you would be losing a very key defender of the king black can even play things like Queen H5 and then Queen A5 which would be very vicious Queen H5 of course putting pressure over here and get Benji any of you that have a dog know that they will just randomly lick themselves for 10 minutes and you can't hear this because my thing has a noise filter behind me is just oh my God it is not a good thing to listen to all right by the magic of video editing the dog got tired of annoying me and decided to leave but that process took a couple of minutes now he's laying on the couch outside we will continue from not this position but this position Wesley so kicks out the night Kasparov goes back develops his other night and now we have an exchange we have a very tense moment here as Gary is going to open up these pieces now this move by Wesley so is trying to plan for the future Wesley is saying my Bishop is bad but in the future I will reopen it and then it's going to be very good that's the plan right well now Kasparov is like okay we'll see about that Knight C6 we have a trade take take take and Bishop G4 Rook is under pressure Rook de1 Gary also castles Queen side remember that Bishop not particularly good this bishop at any moment will come alive and again I have told you throughout this video uh Kasparov one of the best and most feared attacking players in his Heyday doesn't matter if he's 60. remember what I said 60 is not ancient in day to day it's sometimes ancient in chess but he's Kasparov okay most 60 year olds would would be happy to get to this position against Wesley so Kasparov at all points is playing to win against Wesley so from this position um Pawn to H3 played and uh Pawn takes F4 Queen D3 the bishop slides back and now Wesley damages Gary's King side not not kingside that's not a king side that the queen side I meant to say King safety the king's safety is a bit disturbed and you know I would imagine Wesley's idea was this but it's actually not that good because the king just goes here and uh I'm not so sure taking this Pawn is very good because you just get hit with this move now you gotta leave and uh this looks much more dangerous for white than it does for black you know what I mean like it's actually White's king that's feeling very airy while this bishop is still significantly better than that Bishop so Wesley instead plays Knight to F3 now Gary just makes sure to defend everything near his King now Bishop E5 is a interesting move if Knight takes E5 D takes E5 Queen takes E5 Gary is going to launch an attack on the D2 pawn and Gary kind of applies this pressure he hides his King in the corner uh and he plays Queen D7 targeting this and trying to infiltrate right that's the idea he's still creating attacking possibilities against White's King and finally Wesley has gotten his Bishop out 22 moves into the game 14 moves after the move Pawn to C3 has been played and Bishop is free but unfortunately Wesley traded his Bishop for his king queen to D3 now this is targeted this is targeted Bishop F5 is coming Queen is coming and uh -oh uh oh Rook F2 Bishop F5 I'm not so sure you I'm I'm you know you could try to run I'm not sure it's gonna oh that would be really nice I'm not sure it's going to make it any better I mean I have Queen B1 I can always take the bishop and then go there so it's not looking good Wesley has to give away the Rook Gary Roars in with his F Pawn Rook to D7 the king is always safe on B7 Rook F F7 Rook E7 and he is going to get in with Rook E2 just a masterful display of uh of technique Wesley's still trying to create some problems I mean you know it's never too late to hang mate in one Queen A5 that would be all right so Gary buy a miracle doesn't blunder that Rook D2 nice move and um Queen D4 gives a couple checks Rook G7 Rook G2 is coming Wesley so resigns to Gary Kasparov what a game this game literally came down to one move Pawn to C3 and Gary was like okay I'm going to play this game and you are not going to have a bishop and of course Wesley was fine he was very much in the game he was still applying some good pressure and here he he just had to accept the fact that he was not going to rush with the move C4 he was just going to play a game down a bishop and Gary just roared in Queen to D3 Bishop F5 vintage Kasparov dunking the basketball on Wesley so incredible stuff here uh second round of the day Gary's opponent was Hikaru which is always a very fun matchup um and uh Gary played C4 the English opening opening up the bishop potentially he will also move his b-pawn to have laser beam going on over here and that's exactly what we get we actually get both players developing in a way where the Knight is on its natural Square actually this is kind of a game where both Knights will go to a very natural Square the queen is in the corner castling Queen side would be here and here uh and you would need to move these two but both sides actually Castle short so the problem is going to be this piece but it's actually a short-lived problem because you'll develop and go here and I think both sides are gonna have like mutually assured destruction on the king side so Gary plays Pawn to D4 and kikaru plays Pawn takes Pawn takes and pawn to D5 position is very balanced you can take with white uh but you you it's really difficult to create an attack you don't have a Greek gift because your queen doesn't get to H5 uh if you play Knight G5 black just can obviously defend themselves but I think Bishop Ford just wins material it's just a fork so you can't do that so kaspara plays Knight E3 and he's gonna go here and Hikaru is rock solid as well there's a big trade in the center totally symmetrical Pawn structure probably white is better because that's how it goes oh and if you're wondering why Gary Kasparov has the Croatian flag uh he actually I think lives in Croatia like half of the year um that's at least what the stories are I have zero evidence of this I have not been to Garrick as part of his house but Gary if you watch this one day uh please do invite me I'm sure it will be very special uh for me not not not not for Gary um Bishop D2 right everything is looking nice Bishop D7 Hikaru does the same thing both guys centralize the other Bishops I mean you cannot get a more standard looking position if you tried Queen B1 all right Ponto H6 and now Gary plays B4 always trying to pressure that is exactly what he's trying to do here B4 B5 A4 A5 potentially also Queen B3 Queen here maybe we're gonna trade something and get a knight to E5 maybe bishop C3 Knight E5 if you could swap these two would be great unfortunately it's just not possible Queen B8 Gary mobilizes Bishop F4 Hikaru right on time to create the counter play If You Now play Queen takes D5 I go take take I kick your queen out let's say you move I don't know threaten mate I have F5 you go here and black is just fast this is falling this is falling and then after that I can you know eat like a a shish kebab over here little uh Adana Kebab from your local Turkish restaurant that's always tasty so we have Queen B2 instead trying to defend the bishop and I guess it's self-explanatory you don't really want to allow the active queen queen B2 Hikaru creating good counter play and a couple of moves later we have Knight takes Pawn takes Rook takes and Rook d8 and uh Hikaru is uh down a pawn he's down upon but he's got eyes here he's got eyes here and in the future he's gonna have you know eyes there as well and um Kasparov is taking the fight to Hikaru like make no mistake Rook C2 Bishop E6 and Hikaru plays Bishop D5 now this is still a very difficult if not completely unwinnable position for white the reason for that is that you just have a weak Pawn White's entire Advantage is this Central Pawn and pushing it Forward is actually very difficult how does white win this position uh let's just say very hypothetically uh trade a pair of Rooks and then if black is very careless trade a pair of queens and uh maybe try to infiltrate and win that pawn even though you know it's actually impossible to defend this Pawn now even in trying to win this position and playing badly for black I accidentally played well so it's a very tough position to win and so Hikaru is just gonna sit back look at his ayokin's gun the alakins triple stack on the d-pawn and the bishop in the way it's just a tough position Queen before Gary trying but Hikaru can also play this for a win if he gets the pawn back because now Hikaru has the better position and he's no longer down upon see hikaru's position was good he had a really really good setup and maybe Gary's pawns here could be potentially targeted but Hikaru was a pawn down now Hikaru has all the benefits of his position but he's equal material he's no longer down upon and we get to an end game where that's a Target and that's a weakness everything here can be exploited because black has a light squared Bishop so you know black is going to maybe bring the king and Hikaru puts the Rook on A4 making white play passively now kikaru brings his King and he is just taking over absolutely taking over plays Pawn to G5 to restrict the movement over here if this Pawn gets to F4 black has a near positionally winning Advantage because white is severely restricted the bishop is passive The Rook is playing defense and black is just gonna walk the king into the middle of the board and white will run out of moves Rook to D3 hikara now plays Rook C4 and F5 position looking really really nice here G3 now kikaru probably should play F4 here the pawn takes with the idea Rook takes F4 G takes ah that would be a nice Mouse lip this looks good because it forces the king back but actually I think splitting the pawns and then you know if you get to a situation that looks let's say like this it's real bad for uh for white this is restricted that can't move that's all gonna end up on a light Square as well it's a very very tough position but black also doesn't have to do that black and of course just bring the king black and also maybe bring the king over here that's another idea and in here and then it's really really tough so kikaru putting the pressure Bishop to E2 Rook C2 F4 take take and Hikaru plays Bishop C4 but Gary Kasparov all the way back here calculated with like seconds on the clock I mean Kasparov had less than let's say Kasparov had about a minute on the clock Kasparov calculated a 20 move sequence to save this game against Hikaru Nakamura how is that possible with one minute on the clock how was that possible Gary realized that from this position ikaru can take the bishop and pin The Rook to the king Kasparov also realized Hikaru can pin The Rook the bishop trade everything and run his King to win this Pawn and there is a sequence of moves here that goes Bishop C4 Rook D2 take take take King D6 King D3 King C5 A4 King B4 King D4 King A4 King E5 King B5 King F5 A5 King G6 A4 F5 A3 F6 A2 F7 Queen Queen and Kasparov thought that's a draw but there's a problem after Pawn to A4 it's not King B4 you played King C5 to force this move and now you play King D5 this is called white plays H4 black plays H5 and now white is in tukwang which is a situation where you have no move that prevents your opponent from getting exactly what they want it's a situation where you have moves and every single one of them is bad and if you go this way now I win the race and you do not get my Pawn and if you go this way I go get that pawn and you are definitely not fast enough to run all the way back there I will promote a queen and I will execute you so then what did Kasparov calculate all the way back here Gary knew that he would play Bishop here get hit with all of this and Save the Day how on Earth did kusparov calculate he would not lose this game like this Gary calculated Rook situ a pawn trade and now Gary calculated Bishop C4 Rook D2 take take take take King B6 King D3 King C5 and now not A4 which loses to King D5 and sukswang when the black king gets in but rather King C3 completely giving up this Pawn can you imagine the entire idea of the black attack doesn't work because this Pawn is not worth saving if you take this Pawn now that infiltration route is possible whereas now it is not Gary calculated this entire sequence that you were about to see King C3 King B5 King D4 King A4 King E5 B5 King F5 King A3 and now you do not run to this Pawn if you run to this Pawn then after the race concludes black promotes with check with a check so you have to go somewhere else King E6 or King E5 Gary calculates that they both make a queen and now Gary promotes with check Queen before Queen H6 and this game could continue but the players agree to a draw an incredible piece of calculation by Gary Kasparov sensational calculating from a very unpleasant and likely losing end game in some intricate details probably Hikaru needed to be a little bit faster with his king or his pawns but it was subtle and Gary calculates a 20 move sequence with less than a minute on the clock right there King C3 black has no choice black has to take if black doesn't take then you will just keep going and force them to take incredible absolutely incredible that Gary found that on Instinct with that little time on the clock and I got another game for you I got another bang and Gary game so we got King in the center this time we have between the Rooks the Bishops are on their home squares the knights have been relegated to the second league they should win more matches next year and um if you want to Castle this way you would just uh you would just move the bishop and Ray Robson from the United States plays well every player has been from the United States it's not special knight G3 Pawn to D5 C3 C6 H4 H5 so you may ask yourself why did Gary not take the pawn well that loses it's just a fork the thing about Fisher random chess 960 is that there's all these goofy tactics and you'll notice throughout these games like the guys like to open up their queens and Bishops early then they kind of try to think about where their Knights are gonna go and where their King is going to go a little bit later they are not worried about playing obscurely on the edge of the board so Gary plays H5 because Knight takes H5 actually leads to the exact same tactic except it's not a fork it's just the trapped Rook Bishop G5 played by Rey Knight C7 and Gary immediately gets tries to get rid of this bishop he does not like the pressure he does like the pressure but not against this position and now he plays Queen D6 because retreating here means getting your Rook trapped which is very embarrassing and that is not something that Gary would blunder Queen to D6 intending this and FG or queen G6 but I my money's on probably FG trying to keep the queen on the board then black can play for instance H4 and Bishop F5 with a massive Advantage it's just very powerful The Bishop's here Bishop F5 is played by white trying to trade this also to induce this move to try to take the knight uh Gary now plays H4 trying to dislodge that away uh Ray here probably should have immediately prevented you know the H file coming in that's probably what Ray should have done but if you move your Rook you can't Castle anymore regular rules of Chess do apply somehow instead we have this and Gary Gary's understanding of Chess is absurdly high and in this game this one move allows Gary to make about five moves in a row that are very easy which improve his position and ask questions for his opponent that is called an initiative it's when you are you know in any sport or like a you know in in any team sport or in any individual sport like tennis it's when you're on the attack your opponent is responding to you they might not be losing but they are responding and they are playing your game they are fighting your fight okay kind of like arasania was fighting Strickland's fight last night for my UFC fans right so by the way what an upset I mean good Lord Knight E2 and now Gary takes white now has to bring the queen now Gary plays E6 now the Queen's gotta move and now Gary plays E5 so a couple of moves in a row very easily made Ray Robson plays F4 trying to fight back Gary captures and now opts for a very very high level move the best move in this position is very tough to understand uh as a beginner maybe even as an intermediate player I think many people here would would try to play Bishop E7 you can't Castle obviously but you have to understand it's a mix of what does white want and what does black want white would like to continue attacking black wants to find a way to fight back on the color complex where they don't have a bishop which is the light squares and also what we're planning for in the future I mean how will we get this bishop out we can't castle that way so this very nice move Queen D7 this is White's best piece by far if white plays F5 that's actually no longer a threat because of a pin so you could go here which you couldn't do when your queen was there if you went here you would get pinned then you would need to go Queen D7 so Queen D7 and now not Rook takes but King takes the king is safe and now the e-file is opening up these pawns are a bit weak this Pawn can't move because of Gary's H pawn move a while ago and Gary was eight was a master attacking player but he's still a genius at all chess watch how easy he makes this look F5 drops back now the pawn is hanging how are you gonna defend it castling okay fantastic rookie 8. I'm creating a thread Gary's creating a threat Gary is like a cowboy with a gun underneath the pillow that's a threat that's just an idea it's it's always there now Knight C1 Knight C8 both guys rerouting their pieces the bishop has come to play these pawns are a bit overextended attack on the H file attack on the e-file Rey plays Knight B3 Gary great move restricting two night jumps into C5 now F6 yf6 why did we play that move anticipating the arrival of the night Pawn to F6 forcing white to play a move a very tough decision do you take an open up Black's Rook probably not do you play G6 and freeze the pawns permanently for the Knight to Feast the Knight Will feast in the end game or do you play a move like Knight F3 that's what he chooses now Gary Bishop G3 screwing it into the square Knight F2 and you will notice this is the only open file and now white can't even fight for it white can't even fight for the only open file and what's gonna come after the bishop goes to G3 the Knight is Gonna Come to D6 F5 is hanging the question here is brewing the Knight is threatening to jump in at all angles but who else is coming in The Rook you don't always have to sacrifice it for me to yell it The Rook hits the Knight it's got absolutely nothing better than to go backwards I know the Rook goes forward once again Knight G4 Rey is bouncing back and forth now the night goes where the Rook once was and all we have left is this Rook which at some point is going to come alive on the e-file on the G file or on the f file all of these pieces running circles around the white position now a Cool com collected sliding up of the king to D6 just improving the position and here we go Rook C2 Rook D3 there we go Rook is to it coming to f8 Gary already up a pawn it's never too late to win a second one and Gary decides you can play defense but as you play defense your Rook stop guarding your knight there's my H Pawn the H Pawn that started this entire thing the H Pawn that a while ago I moved here to dislodge your knight right wrong variation I moved here to the sludgier Knight same concept wrong variation we go all the way into the future of this game and suddenly that pawn that little Pawn is knocking on the door of the white position this is falling this is falling Gary plays Pawn H2 check and now it's just a matter of getting a knight in and it's going to be a Checkmate so he goes here King takes C4 everything is glued shut Knight F2 and Ray Robson resigns crushing Wesley so with an opposite colored Bishop attack crushing Ray Robson 2700 strength excellent game by Gary the Suffocation from a very very late middle game to an end game a backwards move Queen trade and then all these pieces came alive it was exactly what we would expect Magnus to do to people and Kasparov doesn't get enough credit for being a genius at end games too and then speaking of end games I mean the 20 move sequence that he just envisioned with King to C3 brilliant absolutely brilliant uh Gary slowed down a bit on the second day he had some good positions but uh he only managed to score half out of three unfortunately uh but uh we'll see how he does uh on the final day of this event very very exciting stuff always good to see the goat uh to many and um yeah one more to say get out of here
