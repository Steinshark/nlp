to the video thanks sponsored Gotham oh and by the way I know I just promoted one thing but you may notice there is now a stack of books behind me uh this is not really a promotion but I would just like to say that the UK sent me 20 of my own book so maybe I'll be giving those away in the future maybe I'll be signing some of these I don't know but if you haven't pre-ordered this thing already there's like a million links in the description 16 000 have been pre-ordered so it drops on October 24th I am super super excited uh let's begin this game so I was playing against uh Vladimir bilich uh from uh from Bosnia I do believe Bosnia indeed I've played this gentleman many times and um here we go I got nothing else to say so I started the game with Pawn to B3 because I'm 2700 and I can play whatever openings I want and you can't judge me for that Dad Pawn to D5 Bishop to B2 this is called the nimsa Larson uh I'm allowed to play different openings and I actually don't make many videos where I play B3 Bishop B2 but I've I've played every opening and the point is that you just Target the center from far away black has many approaches uh black can make a pawn move that directly instigates against this approach and then black would try to play Knight C6 and their setups were black once the entire Center and then white challenges Black's grasp on the center uh my opponent though plays it in a way where they are not interested in putting a Pawn on E5 rather they just want one Pawn on D5 and then they're going to play from there and since my opponent has taken a light squared approach in the center of the board I'm going to take a dark squared approach in the center of the board with moves like Knight to F3 and sometimes Pawn to F4 so I played uh Pawn to E3 I I don't like the move C6 there's nothing wrong with the move C6 but you're blocking the development of your knight you are definitely bolstering your Center but now since your knight can't go there it wants to go there and instance you going there would block your Bishop now you are relying on playing kind of a reverse London setup so basically black needs to go Bishop F5 and then Knight D7 which is completely fine I play E3 Bishop F5 and now is kind of an important uh moment in the game which way I'm going to develop and which of these pawns I'm going to move the position is of course equal there is nothing really much to think about here I've probably played some hundreds of games and I generally like to play this move F4 F4 is a mildly weakening move in the sense that the king is a bit weak but it's basically impossible to exploit because it's like move three or four uh and I'm trying to take control of the dark squares and in the future the advancement of this Pawn will help me because I'm going to have a rook on this file so the advancement of this Pawn will likely contribute uh to uh to my attack in the future but for now I am obviously weakening a little bit of central control because I can't ever move the pawn backwards and I won't be able to fight for those squares actually this Pawn is the hero of this game so keep an eye on it my opponent plays E6 now I develop my knight and you kind of see the justification of my entire setup I just have a lot of control of the of the E5 Square now my opponent needs to start developing Knights because if they develop Bishops only they lose they just straight up lose a rook they might be able to trap my rook in the corner but there is absolutely no need to play like this my opponent plays Knight F6 and now I need to finish up my development so I develop my Bishop to E2 black plays H6 black plays H6 because in some positions this bishop is a Target so I can play Knight H4 which is a very sneaky move it looks like white just wanted a castle but now The Bishop's got nowhere to go if Bishop B4 Pawn to D3 Bishop G6 and I'm just gonna take it at some point so like castles castles take take and I just get two Bishops I just I I just get the two Bishops and then I try to get all the other benefits of the position so my opponent preemptively plays H6 which makes sense I wasn't necessarily thinking of Knight H4 but it's just a logical move I Castle my opponent develops the Knight and now it's kind of time to figure out how else I'm going to put my pieces out if I play Knight C3 my knight does not really participate in the game and it blocks my Bishop if I put my knight here by moving this Pawn I really shouldn't do this because I block my Bishop uh but if I play Pawn to D3 which I did a little bit later I weaken that pawn so I have to develop in a in a in a logical way now before I played this move I figured Knight G4 would be an issue Knight G4 so I figured all right I'm gonna play Pawn to H3 first uh and so my opponent developed and now I played Pawn to D3 and Knight to D2 so I've made 10 moves okay I've made 10 moves this is this is my developed position of course I don't have any advantage whatsoever because all we've done is develop our pieces it's just an equal position but we have all the pieces on the board all 16 pieces so now it's time to fight right now is when one side's like a it's like a one-on-one you know kickboxing match you know you jab at each other you you cross you you you fight for foot positioning it's Southpaw Orthodox like everything matters right we're gonna poke and prod at each other one side is gonna be a little bit more aggressive than the other because that's generally how things go and my opponent immediately plays A5 so my opponent wants to instigate on this side of the board and bait upon move out of me or they want to just knock on the door and be like hello so if I play A4 in this position preventing A4 by black that loses control of the dark Square so I played a little bit like a like I played possum a little bit like one square you want to come forward come forward come get me my opponent absolutely came to get me pawn to A4 uh now it is bad for me to leave this here because if take this just opens up a Target in my position now it's also bad for me to take the Rook I mean to take the pawn because my opponent while they can take with the Rook will probably just wait because that pawn is not going anywhere at which point the Knight will arrive and pressure this so instead of that I played B4 but I played B4 knowing full well that that pawn is now a Target and my opponent plays C5 so for the first half of this game you know it's my opponent instigating against me it's my opponent putting pressure on my pawns and very tough decisions I have to make like do I push do I take do I do I help their pieces get out um obviously this is a bad move because I'm just blocking my own bishop and now if my opponent just takes space worst case scenario I get entombed and I mean I'm just like completely suffocating here so C5 played and right around this moment um I decided that I was going to go B5 for two reasons number one I didn't want to facilitate the opening of the position for my opponent if I take you know they're just gonna take back so I play B5 and I figured I could always defend this Pawn with this pawn and then also with my Rook and my Bishop still stays better so my opponent immediately plays Queen A5 targeting my pawn and I can indirectly defend the pawn by playing Rook B1 which defends the pawn because of tactics or I can play this move Pawn to C4 and I thought okay what a very tense position right I mean like black is trying to instigate with me I'm defending my my weak pawns now a move here that surprised me was Pawn take C4 because originally my intention was to just take but then you know I I there's something in chess called seeing a ghost okay and I I saw a ghost here because I really didn't like the opening of this diagonal and the file now the computer is completely unafraid and says play G4 you I mean I would you couldn't pay me money to play the move G4 you could probably I I don't you probably give me ten thousand dollars I'll play the move G4 probably less I I don't actually know it's a good question how much money would you take to play this 20 bucks 50 bucks like I don't know it depends am I in a tournament is there cash on the line I don't know you give me 20 bucks like gets me like you know a coffee in New York City um anyway I so I I didn't like this position I thought I thought all of this pressure was bad for me so I decided I'm gonna sacrifice a pawn not quite as emphatic as sacrificing a rook as I'm famous for but you know what I'll take it and I just completely lost the pawn on B5 but as you can tell despite being a pawn down my position's not bad if it was bad this would be minus one but it's minus point four which means I have compensation I'm compensating you know not like uh not like a man compensates for various personal insecurities by getting a very loud motorcycle that they drive at three o'clock at night in the middle of this big city when everybody's trying to sleep or an aggressive muscle car or anything like that you know I'm compensating for the fact that I don't have a pawn by playing actively on the B file um so I played Rook B1 my opponent got out of the way Queen C6 the problem with Queen C6 is you get out of the way of The Rook but now you walk directly into the next line of assault now here and in all chest positions you should be thinking how do I play with my pawns how do I play with my pieces okay so I'm playing with my pieces here because I'd like to put my Bishop there and my knight is active and I don't mind the trade because that's just going to get more pieces into the game so my opponent plays Queen C7 and I activate my light squared Bishop so I've just made two small improvements and look at this back to equal back to equal despite me being a full Pawn down the reason is it's very tough for black to move black is actually just a couple moves away from getting totally beaten up so my opponent plays Rook A7 I was like man this is a nice looking position for me black is very passive what do I do now and my friends from this point forward from this point forward I played 14 top computer moves in a row it all actually started from around this point from the from this point forward until the conclusion of the game I played the 14 best you could have replaced me with stockfish and Slackers would have played the same moves which is crazy which is absolutely bananas you ready we've played uh 18 moves of chess so it's very close it's like a tie for first stockfish very much still likes G4 and just going just going for it utilizing this bishop utilizing the locked Center lock Center really benefits the attacking side and just going for it like this I did it this way I played Pawn 2 E4 forcing my opponent's Bishop out of the game and now I anticipated that my opponent wants B5 a lot of Chess is realizing what do I want and what do they want selfish chess players worry about what I want I want to attack and all of a sudden comes B5 and now you're like oh man ah Knight E3 and then your opponent plays you know I don't know Rook d8 Pawn to C4 and now you're losing if you can minimize the amount of moments in a chess game you go oh damn I didn't think of that move you're gonna be in good shape so I played Bishop A1 the top computer move because I continue to apply pressure but I stopped the move Pawn to B5 now my opponent plays Rook B8 looks like I'm going to get hit with the move B5 I got no I got no way to stop it B5 is coming can I stop it like nope can't stop it with this or this I'm in trouble I'm in trouble unless this is probably my most clutch move of the game look to B5 that move does nothing except prevent the pawn from physically putting itself on B5 I said nope I'm like the bully at the playground I ran to the slide and I said no this is my slide get out of here and my opponent what makes this move possible and good my opponent can't touch my Rook none of these pieces can get to my Rook none of these pawns can get to my Rook my Rook will just stand there until my opponent finds a way to get rid of it but maybe finding a way to get rid of it is the wrong plan because by trying to get rid of it it's like tying your own shoes together so my opponent reacts immediately to this move plays Knight E8 disconnects The Rook from the King takes a step backwards and gives me access to a square that move is trying to go Knight D6 but then I would just take so by trying to take a step backwards my opponent allows me to play the next top computer move Bishop to H5 on the surface looks like a very beginner move I'm just trying to play Bishop takes F7 but just like this move there's a hidden layer underneath this is Advanced chess there's no way to get rid of my Rook that's what makes it a good move there is no way to get rid of my Bishop except playing this because if you play Knight to D6 I take the Knight and I take the pawn by playing Pawn to G6 you severely weaken this Pawn you weaken your king and you block your Bishop so my move is very clever now at this moment I played one of the best moves I've played in the last couple of months I realized I have way more attacking pieces than my opponent one two three four five potentially and I realized something I don't have to retreat I played the most clutch of the move uh the most clutch move of the game by far here F5 remember I told you that pawn was gonna be a hero F5 that pawn moved on the fourth move of the game you fast forward a little bit later Pawn to F5 Pawn to F5 completely loses the bishop but taking the bishop opens up the king also invites my queen into the position and third of all it takes time one entire move spent on this just allows me to knock on the door but I got news for you what else do you do the computer does not even realize how strong this move is I'm not even exaggerating that sounds like I'm exaggerating the computer does not realize how strong watch it like it says point three point one three right watch this I'm gonna follow what it recommends takes takes takes here Queen d8 this is what the computer recommends Queen G4 King f8 Pawn to F6 Knight takes F6 there's Queen F4 if Bishop takes F6 Rook B6 Rook A6 Rook F takes F6 Knight takes F6 Bishop takes F6 black has to sacrifice otherwise this is coming take take take Knight E5 now suddenly it's ballooned by six to seven X from that original evaluation and the more you let the computer think the bigger the evaluation grows now did I see all of that no absolutely not but what I did know is that this move is actually one of the top computer moves the the others are like Bishop G4 and just slowly attacking F5 is so clever I'm gonna I'm gonna Pat myself on the back here because like I said black has to find 10 moves in a row to not lose everything else is losing every step black takes in the wrong direction after F5 loses the game Pawn takes H5 now before I play Queen H5 I realized I should open up my Rook chess is all about time time and initiative right now I can go Queen H5 but then I'm not gonna have time to open up my rogue so best move top engine move position is plus 4.7 because of this this Pawn is not going anywhere this move hits this and this black is in trouble Pawn takes F7 is devastating Pawn takes Knight is devastating if you play this move I take x-raying you you have to block then I take and after you play something like King f8 I have Bishop G7 King G7 and queen A1 forcing your king to come up at which point it gets mercilessly hunted to its death and I can even promote to a knight and mate you it's very embarrassing it's very it's a very it's made in a few moves so I took on E6 took on E6 and now I went for Queen H5 every move that I have played since I played the move Bishop to A1 has been a top engine move E4 Bishop A1 Rook B5 planting my pieces forward disallowing my opponent forward access now I'm threatening Maiden 2 Queen F7 King h8 double check and that hero Bishop from the corner Black's pieces are all tied together like they none of them can move so my opponent plays Knight F6 my queen obviously makes the next step forward which is Queen F7 check King h8 now what do I do I always like to tell y'all eight times out of ten the best move in chess is not going backwards this is one of the two you could probably go forwards and the attack will succeed like white has a very monstrous attack here look at these pieces 19 points of material on a smoke break as the bank is getting broken into and robbed I mean this is like really really really bad stuff over here so my opponent plays King h8 and I play Knight G4 chess is a simple game the bishop hits this four pieces stockpile very bad news and it's game over but you can still convert a game flawlessly and that is what I tried to do I also have to scan that there's no checks captures or attacks there's no checks my opponent goes Bishop D6 my queen is hanging now the best move in this position is not to trade queens and then take the Knight it's not to play anything else the best move in this position of course you guessed it the best move in this position is to sacrifice Rook takes F6 the idea of this move is very very simple this bishop is a hero you need the bishop you cannot just take on F6 with the bishop you play Rook takes F6 up if the opponent takes Queen F6 King G8 this is mate and this is made in a couple of moves but this is of course Checkmate in one and if my opponent takes like this I get a knight this is discovered check my opponent plays E5 and now we strip the defender Knight takes D6 every piece has been stuck on its Square for the last five to ten moves Bishop takes E5 check Knight takes H6 checkmate the craziest part about this position is these pieces were spectators they did not move I ravaged the black King's territory and nothing was done about it and that Rook stayed right there it's just incredible like the element of time this Rook versus these two Rooks on the edge of the board completely dominated Black's position black was unable to deal with the pressure on the queen side while dealing with the pressure on the king side all the way back here losing the pawn for some compensation ponza E4 putting the bishop right back there and from this point forward these pieces did not move from here Rook B5 and it was an avalanche my opponent made one misstep one dealing with the move Rook to B5 and it was a 10 piece combination Bishop H5 F5 take take again blasting into the position taking a step backwards to pry apart the defenses sacrificing The Rook to win material take the bishop and just I I was so proud of this game um from moves 18 to 32 14 top stockfish moves in a row um hopefully that uh that game taught you a few things taught you uh the importance of understanding what the opponent wants in juxtaposition to what you want peace placement in certain situations and what qualifies as a good move uh how to start an attack how to start a same side attack in chess having a peace majority on that attack using Pawn breaks to break into the position when is a good moment to sacrifice all of this was made possible by the fact that black had no responses black could not capture anything black could not attack anything black had no useful checks and we utilized the space Advantage mobilize forward and uh what a nice game that's all I have for you today get out of here
