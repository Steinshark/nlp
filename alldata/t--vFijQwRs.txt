I think it'd be most appropriate to start off first with who are you why are you on this stream I don't know maybe you like ran out of people to interview or something so I'm like here no um I I run a nonprofit called rise above the disorder or.org um effectively it's like a universal Mental Health Care System people from all over the world come into our programs people that would love to start therapy um but maybe have had difficulties finding a good therapist to see um and most definitely um have struggled to afford the cost of therapy um given the high price of it these days so we do kind of one of two things or both things if needed um you know one find people really great therapists and then two cover the cost with the donations that we raise um we do this at a pretty large scale uh with about uh I want to say like 58,000 people across 135 countries going through our program so it's very large operation um and yeah I I think we connected mostly through Theo um and mostly because I I built the website for all of this and asked Theo for help one day and they kind of took me on and mentored me on how to build websites and stuff yeah yeah that yeah that that that sounds about right um I think that it is first off it's very cool that you were so motivated that you got good at building websites so that that's that in of itself is pretty cool but second off I know my audience well enough that uh I know a lot of them uh struggle specifically with I think impostor syndrome is one of the largest things that I see people mention and you actually mentioned that when we were uh when we were hanging out on the last night of twitchcon you you did mention some of that I I would like to hear some of your thoughts on that uh what do you think people especially in our industry uh the programming industry things they can really get uh you know can kind of look into on that and then second also burnout burnout is also a really another big popular topic specifically among programmers and you might even have a little bit probably of both of those uh during your time making a website for the first time yeah yeah um I I've tried to to do lots of stuff within the dev space um you know this past like year or so previous to that I think a lot of rise above the disorder you know was was really promoting within the gaming space doing fundraisers with gaming content creators um the whole Dev space was really new to me um is still really new to me and as I've gotten into it it's been very um much a different extremities I I I suppose uh a lot of the people that we get in our programs from the dev Comm Community they can't afford mental health care which uh seems seems kind of curious at first given that you know Dev Dev jobs tend to be relatively high paying um except that doesn't seem to apply in other places throughout the worlds where Dev jobs don't pay a whole lot um so we get people who have a lot of experience are very intelligent very bright but don't make really any money as a Dev um and they're in our programs and then we get people who the financial side is not at all an issue for um but they're going through pretty uh Unique Kind of dilemmas um imposter syndrome you know is is probably the most common between the two um and I think the the types of impostor syndrome tend to be very um kind of all over the place but uh I think the most common one I see within impostor syndrome um interestingly enough is people struggling with their stack um struggling to decide what their stack should be made out of and that somehow that kind of rabbit hole is a way for them to um almost avoid going going further into the Imposter syndrome it's kind of like I have to figure out what what stack I want to run with before I can go forward with this idea that um I inherently feel might fail or might expose me to criticism in some way um so we see a lot of that also see impostor syndrome you know kind of dive into am I coding in the right language um I think we had somebody in our program who had actually you know wanted to become a developer heard about us through Theo and has been interested in starting school going to their their local uni to become a developer but has been putting that off for almost five years now because they don't know what language to start with obviously there's much more into that right like there's a lot of things that are keeping them from going further um but we've even had developers who it would be hard to dispute that they were wildly successful in their Endeavors but despite launching programs getting funding things like that just don't feel like they deserve that success or feel like at some point people are going to figure out they're not a good Dev in in their own terms and they'll be exposed um burnout you know burnout with developers is very very high usually I see imposter syndrome and burnout you know stacked on top of each other here okay that's kind of an interesting take on the impostor syndrome that there's so many different ones and I would be I mean I guess I'm personally shocked that people would be so analysis Paralysis on even just choosing a language um at the end of the day I mean the amount of post people saying just pick anything the amount of times I see anyone just just say like just do any like anything is better than nothing because nothing keeps you in the the same position you're already in and so why not try something before nothing so I guess that I mean for me that that one's a little bit surprising I've never I've never really seen that one but I guess I everyone here is probably they're already everyone in twitch chat and and you know in on the YouTubes are already trying to make some sort of decision already programming so I guess I'm kind of missing that very tippy top of the funnel yeah you know impostor is an interesting thing um the the history of this is we actually um not even that many decades ago assumed that imposter syndrome only happened to women um and it wasn't really until the last like decade and a half or so that we actually um you know came up with the idea that imposter syndrome affects everybody um and then within that span of time that impostor syndrome now affects a lot of people um imposter syndrome tends to break itself into two different directions um there's the procrastination side of impostor syndrome where we're essentially you know kind of avoiding what's going on um and finding different ways to uh fill our time with other things that our brain is prioritizing or deeming more important um and then we have the over preparation side of this that is what I see very very commonly amongst devs the over preparation side of impostor syndrome is essentially Perfection it's not wanting to go forward unless we've done absolutely everything right um and in turn both procrastination and over preparation are ways for us to ultimately avoid doing something that we're not comfortable with something that we might have been I I don't know maybe somebody was critical of us in in the past for it or things didn't go well um they ways of avoiding making a decision doing the action um so what they get caught up in that's usually cultural and I think because so many people are trying to pitch different Stacks sell you on different Stacks or have different Frameworks that you know they can monetize towards certain Stacks um it makes sense why so many developers get stuck at which stack should I go with because they're looking through YouTube they're looking through Twitter and people are making fun of different Frameworks different tools different things like that people are very um zealous about their particular stack and so the developer gets stuck in that phase but it's ultimately them just overpreparing if I go with the wrong stack maybe this won't work if I go with the right stack maybe it will work it's kind of interesting I mean in the sense that I don't know maybe maybe it's maybe it's trauma for me maybe it's something maybe whatever it is but in my head I just have this inherent desire to move and so like I am fine always making the wrong decision in the time because I can always go back and fix it whereas I mean it sounds like what you're saying is it's it's a I mean part of it sounds like it's just a worry of making the wrong decision yeah yeah and the the way the brain does this is our brain is very like this is such a uh strange term I guess a startup term but our our brain stack ranks issues in our mind um and in some ways when we are overpreparing this side of impostor syndrome we are putting other things forward before the decision before the the action we don't want to take the one we're not comfortable taking instead we get more manageable ones ones that we think you know we could actually prepare for uh and thus in defeating that problem will then uh it'll be easier to face the other problem problem I don't want to so you know maybe you want to make a decision about which language you learn first but in your mind ultimately it's the decision that I want to get into programming and not maybe something that my parents want me to do or other people want me to do or maybe it's just making a decision in general that if I make the wrong decision towards my life I could fail and it gets pushed back and back and back until it becomes this more surface level issue because you know maybe if I can make a decision on that surface level issue the other stuff gets easier but it doesn't that yeah I mean it it only compounds everything as far as I can tell I mean no matter how good procrastination feels in the moment it only compounds at least for me it compounds any of my problems that I'm having into just further problems and that's usually never a healthy thing um all right so I I do I would love to also hear some of your thoughts on uh burnout because you know obviously I I'm not a a very well-versed individual such as yourself and so you have these beautiful ways of describing things so I'd love if you took a moment to talk a little bit about burnout because it seems like everybody here really enjoys what you're saying they really feel like they you know you're they're like oh he sees me he he knows me right and so it sounds like you just you just have a way of saying things that is fantastic so I mean a lot of I get this is probably my more common question I get at least in twitch chat is going to be centered around burnout and not centered around impostor syndrome uh I have my own personal thoughts on burnout uh but I'd like to hear maybe someone that has been around enough people to have a perhaps a a wiser opinion than mine um yeah I mean burnout um I mean the beautiful part uh about you know burnout imposture syndrome um is that I mean the these are disorders the these are diagnoses these are things that we you know can understand and you know we can have opinions on various aspects of them um but do they exist yes do they impact the body yes um do we see them impact the the physical makeup of the brain uh and change our moods our behaviors our social interaction absolutely um are they treatable definitely um burnout is a very very curious condition um and and you know for the most part you know we see burnout as as a catchall term for somebody who's kind of just over uh what they've been working on and you know is is they're starting to feel that uh the drain of it all um you know more more to the term of like a clinical case of burnout uh we have somebody who has been working on the same problem for a very long time and is not feeling the the solution the rewards cycle kick in um you know if if your goal is to build the you know biggest uh I don't know SAS company in history that's that's a pretty big lofty goal um how you get there how you measure the steps towards getting there how you chart progress towards these things becomes very very vague and it's not going to feel like you're making real progress towards that um until you are the biggest SAS company or run the biggest SAS company in the world it's it's just going to kind of feel like trudging through the mud um people that are experiencing burnout are often in that space goals become more obscure more confused the sense of reward the sense of achievement starts to become uh diluted it's not felt it's not present in each day and the Brain naturally starts to kind of tune out of it our our ability to even focus on some of these things starts to go away um over time you know burnout starts to be felt physically um the body just feels exhausted the brain feels exhausted you have a lot more of those moments where you're just kind of blank and unfocused um people tend to um look at what they were working on as being less valuable less interesting as as a way of almost kind of dealing with that disconnection you know maybe this isn't what I want or maybe this isn't the place I want to be or you know who cares about you know building the biggest SAS company you it's our brains way of coping with the the vagueness of it all um but it is not uncommon for Burnout to progress in a sense into something like depression or in in to something like an anxiety disorder and that's usually where we see people the most when burnout progresses into depression when it goes towards um not only do I not know what I'm supposed to be doing but I don't think I could do it even if I did or I don't feel like I could do anything I don't have the energy to do anything it's it's waking up without the motivation it's waking up without the direction the goal and feeling lost a lot of the time yeah my only kind of General experience with that is I was working on something called falor a way back uh Fs in the chat for falor but you know like I was just working gosh 70 hours a week for an ex an exceptionally long period of time and it just kept going and the goals just kept moving everything just kept changing over and over and over again and you know I'm you know as I mentioned I'm a very biased to action kind of person and growing up being uh I guess growing up in an environment in which you're very poor and you have to kind of like fight for what you have I kind of have this continual push inside of me to keep going and I Remember by about by Christmas I remember receiving a phone call on Christmas Eve about another way we could do something and I felt like instead of you know I never really had the feeling of of like being so tired I couldn't do anything I just remember an ever grow like angster anger inside of me where it's just like I felt more and more angry and I felt more and more like I just want to like just like quit the whole thing right like I guess that's more of my response I'm not sure if that is of the same vein but it it just lasted for months to the point where afterwards I just quit and then I didn't do any open source programming I didn't do anything beyond what was absolutely required of me Qui quitting I guess as some people kind of call it slightly more than quiet quitting it'd be very hard for me to do that but something like that for like three straight great years like it was impossible for me to kind of go beyond that yeah I mean burnout looks a lot like that um you know it it is something that you know can be diagnosed with with more I guess you know exploration in into that but um burnout can leave remnants of like trauma within our life as well where we start to become pretty opposed to things that we out of maybe you don't ever want to work in a certain field anymore or work for a certain company anymore um work for certain types of people anymore because it is it's connected to that uh almost like the sense of hopelessness um it it is you know something that there is a lot of research into you know what gives people a a sense of fulfillment and and usually you know it's some kind of monetary um in component which is actually kind of the lowest necessary one for us um then there is acknowledgement and praise for what we were doing um and then there is like a a deeper connection to community that's found through it um when we have these things we feel pretty good we feel like we're moving forward but for a lot of developers that are working for a company alongside a bunch of other developers who you know are just seeing ticket after tickets or given you know kind of an idea for a project and they're just supposed to execute on this stuff um it can be pretty hard to find a sense of of meaning Community um even if the monetary side is really high um there's there's just a lot of room for you to kind of fall through the gaps and not get any kind of praise to not get any kind of of acknowledgement um and even as you start to get closer and closer to accomplishing goals usually the the better it seems you do in developing a program the more there becomes that you need to do um you I think of of some of the devs I've talked to um at Spotify specifically and their kind of difficulties with you know every time we do something really well a new request a new feature comes up so it's like my reward for doing something really well is having to now do something else really well um in in setting a new standard so it's like when does it end um and what is what is the achievement here um so I actually had a pretty interesting question in here which is as like a lead or a manager what are some things what are some good first proactive steps you can do uh when you start to feel like one of the people you are either you know in some level of in charge of is looking like they're on the precipice Andor burning out yeah yeah um it can seem really counterintuitive uh initially but um give them time off uh if it's at all feasible if it's all at all affordable um time away is is absolutely massive um it takes about a week for someone to really start to begin the unwinding process ideally it takes about two weeks when somebody finally disconnects from things that's where they're not thinking about the emails they're not thinking about the project as much they're starting to shift more into relaxation um and I've noticed that shortly after that two we Mark is where there's almost this full cycle back to where somebody kind of misses some of these things or starts to have more positive thoughts towards these things um you'll notice somebody that's burning out isn't innovating isn't coming up with new things isn't really excited or passionate about their project anymore but given some time away from that stress away from that pressure they'll slowly potentially rebuild that passion and start to think oh I actually really want to work on this feature I actually think there was a problem that I had a couple of weeks ago I think I actually know the solution or have an idea for it they start to get that excitement again um so when they come back they might bring that energy back um aside from that um or in addition to that having much much more achievable um goals breaking things down into things that person can accomplish and and measure that's really good um sometimes it's like pushing a certain PR or it's having um you know created or finished a full feature of stuff breaking those down into something much much more achievable helps significantly because they're going to feel the reward cycle right it's like clicking the you know to-do list and and completing it we want to break things down so that there's much more um display that that something was done and not just we're getting ever closer but there's still a long way to go um and I think that can be extremely important and then just praise um acknowledge them regular acknowledgement in the oneto ones um can be absolutely massive in team meetings acknowledging people um calling out their achievements goes a really long way towards this person feel like they're they're accomplishing things and not just kind of stuck okay that those are all really good things uh lastly do you have anything to say about like um some early signs in your life cuz I can kind of tell you personally I I could kind of see it happening for me you know looking back is that I personally started playing a lot more video games and this was kind of me in a sense coping during this time uh I played a lot lot more normally I'm not a like I love like I grew up playing them my dad died when I was young and that was kind of like my large Escape if you will that was always the greatest thing ever was video games uh played a massive amount of them until I was about gosh 25 right right around in there is when I kind of really stopped playing very much of them and for the last 12 13 years I haven't played much of anything and so I remember that during that time the falor time that was when I all a sudden started playing a lot I got all the way up to like diamond Rank and Halo feeling pretty good you know started playing a lot a lot of Halo 3 uh or whatever it was Halo 5 I think at the time yeah Halo 5 and so it's like at that point for me you know looking back that was kind of my early indicator was I was doing something kind of Fairly unusual I guess for myself in this in this life period uh do you have any is that like a thing first off second thing is there things people can look for in their own life that they're doing yeah yeah definitely um you know something that I've seen you know time and time again is is most people are pretty aware of when they're they're kind of moving into to unhealthy patterns when they're finding unhealthy ways of of coping with the problems in front of them um this this is stuff that's um can be hard to document uh at times but that's almost certainly you know part of the solution is actually just kind of making a note of what I'm doing when I'm feeling pretty overwhelmed um sometimes it's you know instinctively just opening up YouTube or opening up twitch or opening up Twitter um sometimes it's launching a game there are things that we'll do almost impulsively um when this is starting to set in when we're starting to to become overwhelmed with the stress um I try and write that kind of stuff down um you know even if you aren't very um familiar with taking these kinds of notes or daily journals it's it's a really helpful practice um it's a really great way to reflect on what's going on in your own life things that you wouldn't normally notice you're now making that mental note of um so jotting things these things down I've noticed I've played more games today that's something that you can think in the moment while you're actively playing a game but writing it down actually makes that strong mental note of oh yeah actually I am in the past few days I noted down that I've been playing more games than usual okay so maybe that's something I need to work on um once we we start to kind of put that down on paper somewhere it's a lot easier to to tackle to acknowledge um so you know we we can notice these things when we become aware when we we give ourselves time to be aware of these things the the other sides of this is that it's not NE inherently bad for us to distract when we're feeling overwhelmed or stressed um but having a a a line that we draw between okay I'm just stressed and you know this is a healthy distraction versus like I've been playing games for like the last 10 and a half hours or 11 hours and didn't do work today obviously something is is clearly wrong there something's not going well there um setting aside specific times where we can engage in some of these behaviors and and kind of giving ourselves that as a reward can be extremely helpful um but you know that's that's stuff that from my experience um all of this stuff is really hard to do when you're in the middle of it usually we got here because we we don't really do these kinds of practices we don't incorporate these kinds of things and healthy and unhealthy blend together really really fast um I think really the best way if you're in the midst of it is to focus on the basics um anytime I see somebody really overwhelmed really flooded with stress I I always try and encourage focusing much more on the basics don't try and solve all of the biggest problems going up on in life try and solve the Sleep problem try and solve the the eating the diet problem try and solve the exercise problem try and solve the just spending some time thinking problem um even if it's just sitting in the shower in the morning and not doing anything but just really thinking about life not being distracted but letting it kind of hit you those are really important times for us to have we lose track of those Basics very very quickly so if we can just return to those once we start eating better sleeping better exercising a little bit bit better reflecting better the other problems that we have in life become much more approachable uh much more solvable the Sol Solutions become much more apparent feels less overwhelming altogether all right uh I really like that I I I really like that I think that you know I always call one of my perennial tweets is just the pathway to become a better software engineer is to eat healthy sleep more exercise like touch grass like all the simple things and you know cuz I it just it just helps me like one of the easiest ways I know that I'm or just have a terrible day is just I don't get enough sleep for two three days in a row I'm going to fight with my wife I'm not going to you know like I'm just going to be all out of sorts pretty quickly the same thing with eating I can tell it right away if I eat within the next six you know six hours it does have an impact on just like your just general perception how you perceive things how you kind of communicate out and so just trying to be really careful on those things seems to just make the biggest bang for the buck Y which is strange because you know it feels like like eating okay you're just getting calories in calories out right it's it's straightforward it's like no there's there's actually quite a bit of hierarchy to it and you really should do that a lot better in sleeping again very very simple go to bed at the same time wake up at the same time and that will just change your life just as simple as that yeah I mean those mixed with with in you know in my opinion meaning um and purpose you know invaluable um and I think about those things you know quite a bit in my own life meaning and purpose um you know part of part of what got my uh you know my connection to you you know ultimately um through through three through through Theo um was you know how I built the website and and what you know transpired there um because I I had never coded in my life um prior to meeting Theo um had no experience with it but you know I was trying to get a new website for nonprofit and every agency I went to every group I talked to wanted a ridiculous amount of money um and I thought you know if I could figure out how to build a website from scratch and the process of doing that you know TimeWise costs less than hiring an agency then great that's that's like good value that's worth it um and it ended up figuring out how to code um you know and do the site the the front the back end everything within the span of a month um the the person that was kind of giving me feedback was like Hey like you're starting to have questions that like I don't have answers to you should reach out to this guy um he could probably help you um and when Theo you know realized that I you know learned JavaScript um and and node and and all of this within the span of a month was like oh that's that's not normal I should connect you to other people um CU that that doesn't happen um and I think even just over the weekend of meeting Theo and some of his friends learn typescript and switched over to typescript and and making things type safe I think since then I've learned rust and and CP um spelt and and so many other things usually within the span of of a week to to two weeks um all of it because you know a lot of these these principles we've talked about um you have kind of refined down um to avoid the over procrastination or the the over Perfection process really time gating um being very quick about rewards being very specific and Purpose Driven um you know the the goal obviously was was very very clear it was not a vague one it was we just need to get a working website and then this is how we Define a working website and save money and here's how we save money by only spending x amount of time working on it so the project had deadlines it had specific measurables and markers um adding in new features learning new things came along as it made sense within the project framework and then um you know funny enough once the website was done um I just stopped coding I was just like cool I don't need this anymore like we did the thing until you know many many months later where I just found so many different problems uh that could be solved by coding and then you know really developed a passion for it um you know I think it it also helps though that there's a level of Detachment um you know I I when I run into people who are trying to figure out what stack they should go with or um who they should follow is in terms of an influencer where they should get the latest information if they should you know write code this way or that way all of those things you know can seem really important to them because it's a part of their identity within the community for me it's whatever works whatever I enjoy I don't really you I don't have as much of a stake in it um for me it's a means to an end and I think a lot of us lose track in that um you know the true meaning true purpose tends to usurp all of those things and makes just about everything else we do much much easier um but that's really hard that's that's a harder part of life you know Finding meaning and purpose slightly slightly more difficult than finding what you're going to do um well hey thank you very much for coming on on uh the show I want to try to keep it brief enough that people stick around and listen to the whole thing this was awesome so obviously you run uh rise above the disorder right here rad uh you're on Twitch you're on the twitters you kind of are all over the place uh is there any any important links people should know about uh when trying to find you and second off what is a good place is .org donate a good place to go to donate yes absolutely if you go there to donate that's going to cover somebody's therapy session today tomorrow um almost certainly right away because there are lots of people applying uh we get about 400 applications a week so there's a huge demand for free therapy um so you can make somebody's therapy session possible today um in terms of finding me uh I'm on Twitter as well my tag is just Jason dockton my my full name um so you can always look me up I don't post a whole lot uh you know I'm trying to get into the habit of doing that but maybe if you follow me or ping me enough I'll definitely start responding more I'm certainly happy to answer questions so look me up right there all right thank you very much Jason I appreciate that thanks man it's been such a pleasure yeah yeah take care
