one of the most common misconceptions is that complex phenomena arise from complex rules in reality the more rules a system has the more constrained it is emergent behaviors often well emerge from simple discrete rules that have seemingly nothing to do with them like chess and go sometimes complexity can hide in the most unexpected places I'm Alan zukon and in this short documentary where we get lost in the endless complexity of a game so apparently simple that its creator could be life it's a good intro this is a good intro I'm I'm excited you know I I've been thinking a lot about this lately just this entire concept of complexity versus Simplicity uh especially in your programming languages it's why I've been really just enjoying building actual Tools in go as of recent the tools I'm building aren't very very complex but just using something as simple as HTM X and go lately again htx and go referenced boom let's go um it's also just made me realize that sometimes Simplicity is a pain in the ass but often it's really simple it can make a lot of problems simple some problems hard and I'm not really sure if if the tradeoff is worth the other side yet is complexity in a language or complexity in a system say react or or spelt or or solid is the trade-off worth it is a little I I know it's not talking about programming languages but just this concept of of complexity Simplicity and simplicity can lead to complexity and just the general idea right I'm just kind of pondering it you know I'm I've been thinking about it a lot because at the end of the day you have to spend your life doing something and so which one is going to allow you to do it most effectively with the least amount of just kind of like you know of just maintenance nightmare because I mean at the end of the day I don't believe in DX I don't believe in all these things that people keep talking about how there's there actually is some Easy System that's why I don't need to keep abstracting because I don't think you're going to make the system any easier the more you hide complexity you're just adding more more lines of codee and you're just adding new complexity right that's all you're doing you're just adding new complexity I believe in DMX you know what I mean and so I've just been thinking about it a lot anyways this is good I'm excited for this the reason why I mentioned htx is because I built Conway's Game of Life using uh just JavaScript and then saving the states to a database using just like HTM X little hooks for post and delete and all that and so that's why mention it I just you know Conway's Game of Life it was a it was the perfect example of can you make a highly interactive application with HT Max you can WR by Martin Gardner called mathematical games in the October 1970 ISS of Scientific American Gardner talk about a fantastic combination of this new solit game called life that was going to become one of his most successful columns Sol like chess and go life is played with pieces on a board but and like chess and go he requires no players a zero player game with no winners or losers which results is fully detered by the initial configuration of the pieces on the board a player is only needed to advance the state of the game to the next turn a generation following three Simple Rules one survival yep every piece surrounded by two or three other pieces survives for the next turn yep two death each piece surrounded by four or more pieces dies from over population sad likewise every piece next to one or no pieces at all dies from isolation three Arch programmers are currently in shambles right now you're telling me that to play the game of life you have to be able to interact with other people yeah real game of life you're going to have to be around more than zero to one people you're going to actually have to you know you're going to have to interact with real life or you die you saw that you die each Square adjacent to exactly three pieces give birth to piece that's a strange rule bizarre game was John hon Conway a brilliant British mathematician ated by the exploration of mathematics in its purest form the recreational one Conway had carefully designed the rules behind his game of life with the intent of making its Evolution unpredictable the idea was to find a simple set of rules which allowed the merger of two seemingly disconnected Fields engineering and biology some 30 years prior to you're welcome for screening Stanis Wan and John fman explore the theory behind self-replicating I always have this question okay I always have this question which is what life do you live in which you can invent Conway's Game of Life like what what kind of Life setup do you have to have where you're just like I'm G to I'm going to explore this like you're writing it down on pieces of paper you know I mean it's super cool don't get me wrong like I'm super I think it's super cool it I just don't you know you know what I'm trying to say here like I I don't have time for that I got like a wife and kids like if my wife came in she's like what are you doing I'm like I I'm working on this really cool mathematical game and been thinking about it for years she'd be like what the hell are you doing you will go and play with the kids uh single and wealthy is that you have to be a SN no job bored and alone okay okay sink is a single single income no kids dink being double income no kids he was a professor ah yes classic University Professor where the Bastion of free Society go two dimensional greets updated in discret steps following precise and deterministic rules yeah they called them cellular aom oh yeah that was so satisf in scientific Amer I will say that the sound of a pencil on like Paper Plus something hard behind it that was so good it's just so good it's so good it feels good life got so popular among mathematicians that a quoty newsletter called Lifeline started appearing wow there that its editor Robin wingright published a system to classify the many objects patterns as they called that he saw appearing in the game class one are they so-called steel lives patterns that do not change over time oh wow are called oscillators and they repat a certain number of generation they are classified based on their period wow blinker for instance repeats after two generations hence it has period two it's just it's so funny to me the people saw this and then a newsletter goes out they start classifying all this Behavior I just want to see the shooter how do they make the shooters I like the one that shoots how cool is that many believe that oscillators of any period can be constructed in life and indeed and exist for all period except 19 38 and 41 class three groups some of the most studed buttons spaceships those are oscillators that at the end of the cycle somehow find themselves in a different position they effectively move the most well-known and loved is without any doubt the glider discovered in 1969 by the British mathematician Richard Kenneth guy he was named by John Conway himself to to property exhibits called Glide symmetry gliders are the smallest spaceship known to exist and yet they play a fundamental role for all mathematicians and computer scientists interested in studying life from a more academic point of view a major breakthrough occurred in 1970 when Conway himself himself offed $50 to the first could find a configuration which grew indefinitely the American mathematician in programming me gosper responded with what is now known as a gosper glider gun and oscillated that every 30 Generations spones a new glider that was the first class 4 object to be discovered class five pattern behave seemingly erratically chaotic as we would say today until they eventually collapse to one of the aformentioned classes but some patterns ad doomed to a different fate remaining in a Perpetual state of chaos forever evolving yet never stabilizing on something predictable these is the mysterious squir Classics life it is this is always so shocking to me that you know give any sophistically sufficiently complicated system right I know life's rules are really simple but what it produces is fairly complex but no matter like no matter how useless a complicated system is there will always be somebody who is expert in it class five battle cruiser long as it has a yokoto laser gun on it that's all I want um it's just funny how it's I mean to me it just it shocks me that these things do exist right that you just get a complex enough dude it just just somebody will be attached to it and someone will like classify it it's wild that this classification is really good considering that five and six are like the the the precursors to those four like I mean it's it's really well like proc macros they're P macros these and remains a fully deterministic game with clear rules and no randomness of any kind yet generally speaking the fate of a pattern cannot be predicted without simulating it directly one could simply wait until a pattern eventually falls into a stable configuration but if it does not if it truly belongs to Classic then you would wait forever for an answer which will never come The Game of Life is ultimately undecidable through a many patterns whose fate is easy to predict but in general this cannot be done for an arbitrary pattern that might sound like a bold statement but if we want to understand why we need to go deeper let's tight your glider because we're about to build a computer in life I've been holding tight on my glider for a while now logic gates the first step to creating a computer is well I really want to have a picture of me like that I want a bookshelf in disarray while holding some complex sticking ball thing dude that photo is amaz that photo's amazing that photo is amazing I want that photo the man's a legend I want it in black and white to understand how computers work in the first place comp windower performs the computation the processor takes electrical signals and combines them using special circuits called logic gates they can per very simple mathematical operations using only two values zero and one components and code those zeros and ones two different voltages such as zero and 5 volts but here in life we need to think who we need something that can travel the GRE carrying information with it and that can be easily created and destroyed gliders satisfy all of these properties and are the perfect candidates to be use as signal carriers okay a new glider can be created every 30 Generations using a gan so finding one at a specific location every 30 Generations means that we have received a part a single bit of information and if we do not receive a glider every 30 Generations that counts as receiving a zero we can imagine a traveling glader as a single bit of information moving along an invisible wire this allows encoding any binary signal let's go of gliders and all of the binary operations that one can imagine between those sequences can actually be implemented using just three very simple logic gates not and and or oh you guys can't even see it's the simp logic gates that we can construct is a not gate it takes a signal that invert it state in life so the empty spaces us are zeros just three very simple logic GES not and an all that make sense the simplest log those things being s out at a consistent rate it takes a signal and inv hey polar mut this means constructing a pattern that will do two things producing we are creating the most efficient computer ever and stopping any incoming gliders from traveling any further it is pretty clear that for the former we need a go gun since the not gate has to generate a stream of gliders when nothing is been received a we can exploit another important property of gliders if two of them Collide in just the right way they annihilate each other we can carefully place the gosun so that it is blocked by the input stream when a glider arrives it will stop the output stream and when no gliders are received the stream will carry on undisturbed an endgate takes two inputs hands to streams and produces a new glider or I just want to make sure like at the end of this video If we don't produce Doom I'm just going to be genuinely disappointed okay if this does not end with doom I am so upset only when you receipes two at the same time you can construct such a pattern by modifying an extending and existing not gate how do they even get to this point well in these construction can use a glider stream generated from gun a as the output for our logic G if a is off the output stream will be off as well regardless of the state of B the gun on the right is then placed in such a way that its glider stream will annihilate any glider coming from a in order for the signal a to survive the gliders from B must block the incoming stream this means that only when both A and B are switched on a glad stream can travel any further this is indeed an end gate when both input signals are off the stream from the GS Bean would eventually travel outside the gate to stop it from propagating too far we can add a special button called a glider eater that well eats an incoming glider the last gate we will construct is an orgate as the name suggests it produces a glider when it receives at least one from its two input streams once again this can be constructed by modifying an existing endgate the idea is to use the input stream to block a gus gun which would have otherwise blocked the output stream what makes the knot and an or gate so fundamental is that they are a functionally complete set of logic gates it means that they can be chained together to compute the results of any aitly complex binary expression but will that be enough to build a computer well the answer is no as the information the glider streams only flow okay so the thing that I I really am hoping to see is that somehow you can programmatically create these little gliders like if you can create these little gliders programmatically somehow I'm not sure how you you You' encode information into Conway's Game of Life but if you can you know what happens right we got Doom like it's right around the corner pre-at no I'm an engineer stop it I'm an engineer Dam it like this is what I want to see this is where it's at I'm all I want it's on GitHub already shut up stop rooting it this all makes sense though for those don't understand what's happening here it's very very simple obviously here's the input stream right here coming in right here is B if B hits one of these that means B's on in some sense if a hits one of them it's on if they're both if they're both on then a should never uh a should not be terminated so thus a continues on so if you don't understand what's happening here it's pretty like a pretty simple logic gate if this thing gets all the way through then obviously uh A and B are both not on if just B's on then a will never go if just A's on then a will never go through and make it so it's like they they both have to be on for the little little guys to come through it's kind of neat right from the top to the bottom what makes computers well computers yeah they that's the so that's the confusing part is how do they prepare how do because you have to travel in real time so how do you I mean is it really any different than anything else I don't know but how do you send out a signal and time it the timing seems really confusing to reuse their previous outputs as inputs but luckily for us an entire group of patterns called reflectors allows just that when a glider hits a reflector it bounces off in a different direction this really allows us to R direct glider stream pretty much wherever we want even to use the result of a logic gate as its input now we really do have everything we need to build a computer starting from one of its small space components memory blocks one of the simplest form of memory storage in modern Electronics is a latch latches are simple circuits that can store a single bit either zero or one and which have two inputs called set and reset they used to set the memory to one and to reset it back to zero respectively intuitively you can imagine latches as switches that once pressed remember the state in which they are even when you stop pressing them a very simple set reset latch can be constructed in life using just four Gates Al a very simple set relatch set reset latch can be constructed using four Gates this is a very simple one by the way this is very simple this is actually super cool because I mean if you ignore the craziness of these like little glider gun generators whatever they call them these class 4 items if you can ignore that and try to just comprehend what's going on here it seems like it is uh it seems like this is a good way to like learn how things kind of work here this is how they built Java that would make for a pretty bulky assembly luckily for us there is a rather inexpensive pattern that can do exactly the same in a much smaller space ooh it uses two gos guns pointing at each other when a single glider hits a gun in just the right way it introduces a momentarily delay in its flow this causes an offset in the Glad stream that a gun produces which changes the dynamic of the Collision this indeed works as a switch I wanted to see the other side hit it and turn it off HTML 5 supercomputers Looking thick right now this is what dude how do you take the time to figure I just I mean I know this is impressive this is genuinely the most impressive thing I've seen in a long time showing the logic gates and memory blocks can be built in a system is basically enough to prove that at least in theory we can build a proper computer in it these systems are said to be in complete after the English mathematician can't look at mcraft I don't know why it's Minecraft only Minecraft makes me sick it's the only video pretty much like life does allow players to build in complete this is but tell me you're an AR user without telling me you're an art User it's the field of view I literally have Absolut I've never been sick from a single video game in my entire lifetime except for Minecraft Minecraft infinite Factory Prison Architect City skylines bab Zoo are all unintentionally T incomplete and many players myself included enjoy the challenge of building actual computers in them that's kind of fun no matter how small slow or limited those in game construtions are they could nonetheless solve the same class of problems that even the most powerful computers can being incomplete is not measured in gigabytes or teraflops but in which class of problems you can solve and matter of how powerful a cheing machine is there are indeed problems that he cannot solve many of those undecidable problems exist with the most famous being the Tim problem deciding whether or not a given program will eventually terminate this should sound very familiar if the r programs Wars Evolution cannot be predicted and if those very same programs could be included in life then it follows that there must be patterns WS Evolution cannot be predicted the mysterious elusive classic now that we know that building a computer in life is technically possible it would be rather antic climactic to end the video without showing an actual computer bu in life yep in April 2000 Paul renle created the first fully functioning computer in the form of a touring machine a construct War architecture was devised by alen touring himself and which often serves as the base to study computers in a more abstract and mathematical sense okay randle's T machine takes 11,040 generations to complete one cycle and the one you see here computes a simple finest State machine with three states so what you're trying to say just just so I understand this correctly you're trying to say that this thing still runs faster than anything on web 3 it's more power efficient than web 3 we should just we should just consider using Conway's Game of Life for web 3 instead because I mean that sounds pretty efficient at this point Renda later released two improved versions of his design including a full Universal Chey machine a Chey machine most program is running another cheery machine an even bigger result was achieved by nikolo in 2016 when he crafted an 8bit programmable computer compared to a Chri machine this is without any doubt a computer in its modern form it supports eight variables and 13 instructions what makes this endeavor even more surprising is the fact that loo crafted this pattern started from only four basic patterns a period 60 glider gun a 90° glider reflector for whatever reason seeing a large system all work together there's something so satisfying about it isn't it strange to just watching something like that it's just it just feels so good it just it I you know even if I'm too St I'm too stupid to understand it doesn't matter it feels good a glid duplicator I've never tried playing factoral once they were used to create I have a general rule of thumb which is if I play video games I play video games to escape reality okay so I want to play Apex I want to play fortnite I want to play uh Elden ring love Elden ring I want to play things that just help me escape reality right that's why I I really love playing video games and so I cannot possibly play a video game that is factorio I can't go back to work for my casual time okay like I I just can't I test the I test I test my brain all day every day I just need I need a little bit I just need my my own personal time okay my own personal time by the way I think November 3D likely November 3rd I will be doing a 24-hour stream charity extra life and it will involve some video games say you hate your job no I just don't want to do it all the time he was able to assemble all the necessary circuitry to create basic components for his computer namely set which used to create memory blocks and others used to build an arithmetic and logic unit capable of Performing simple operations on binary numbers okay oh look at that look at how satis is currently busy calculating numbers from the Fibonacci series many more people contributed to the creation of some rather outstanding Contraptions in life such as this digital clock which come with its own for digit display but perhaps one of the most intriguing aspects of being T incomplete is not really the fact that you could build computer in life is the fact that you can see life within life [Music] itself oh yeah oh yeah give me the reveal give me the reveal give it to [Music] me oh it's speeding it up oh let's go let's go let's go Cycles are going out of control look at all those Gates oh my goodness gracious oh oh oh oh struggle struggling we're struggling oh I can know [Music] oh are we supposed to be scared I think we're supposed to have an erection right now cuz that's what's currently happening oh my goodness I almost just threw up I see what what happening now oh my goodness look at it oh no way no no no no don't do it don't do it oh man there better be Doom I hope there's do Game of Life is undoubtedly one of the most successful of s ever discovered so some might undoubtly struggle to understand how simulation they requires well no players could even be described as a game how many years that so long Prett much like any other product like dude clearly we are in a cellular cellular automata life simulation right now that okay that maybe it was all worth it maybe I that alone has potentially restored my faith in useless research of the title is a game because for decades he has been capturing the attention of millions H also useless 50 years after its original publication thousands are still not just playing it are conducting actual research on it as it turns out life is more than just a game Conway's achievement was not just discovering what is possibly the most interesting sason but also to make this entire New Field appealing to a much larger audience on the 11th of April 2020 John Holton Conway died of complication from coid 19 he was 82 years old and many remember him as one of the most charismatic mathematician of his time in Awards of his biographer shivon Roberts John hton Conway is perhaps the most lovable legom Maniac he is Archimedes Nick Jugger savador Ali and Richard fan all rolled into one he is one of the greatest living mathematicians with a s sense of humor a polymath promiscuous curiosity and a compulsion to explain everything about award to everyone in it according to Sir michaeler former president of the Royal Society and arbiter of mathematical fashion Conway is the most magical mathematician the W and as the most magical ma that's a pretty that's pretty big that's pretty big comp compliment right there the most magical mathematician in the world yeah poor dude sucks sucks that he's out but incredible I mean I shocked at how much one person build as his life leads on Alan great video absolutely loved it uh man sometimes you know when I see these things like I hope what this really gives you at the end of the day I hope when you watch a video like this what it it doesn't just give you this feeling of like wow people are super smart and I'm super stupid Stave um I think the thing that I should give you is that everything in life everything in programming everything that you see can be built from these really simple pieces and that all you have to do is learn the simple pieces right so even if you don't end up learning these simple pieces you don't end up doing all that don't get impostor Syndrome from these kind of videos just realize that things are simpler than you've probably made them in your head and that if you ever wanted to learn them you could right like like a like a logic gate is not hard a logic gate like an and logic gate is four states you could learn that you have you already know them because you do if statements right and so just like learning the gates and then after you learn the gates maybe you have to do a little bit of Carnot Maps you have to do a little bit extra and then you know put a few together and you could make something learning I used to know how to do a transition or transistor at one point you could put them all together you know you can just do each one of them slowly over time it's just like anything is learnable right and I think a lot of times people just have this there's just this General fear to learn something that you don't understand anyways it's just something to think about is that things aren't confusing and so I know a lot of you a lot of you that watch these videos uh watch my videos are people that are just like all you know is nextjs and react right I know there's a lot of you like that and you're just trying to figure out the whole world of programming and everything loser okay big loser wait loser uh but with that in like in mind in thought just remember that nextjs react like all these things they're not that confusing and what I mean is that if if you were to try to understand say how page based routing works it's really not that hard I bet you could build it few weeks right like you could actually figure out how that works pretty quickly and then you could keep on going and going and going and you could actually get smarter and you realize how simple these things really are like what you use is just pretty straightforward right everyone has skill issues file based rout not page based routing yeah file Bas routing whatever you call it it's actually like all these things aren't that hard and then you can start seeing why they make these decisions and then you become a better engineer and then you're the engineer people go to because you took the time to understand how something works a bit underneath yeah I know I saw some video saying cashing is simple I just have a hard time believing it or even watching it anyways like right now at my job I'm helping to I'm helping I'm not the primary person on this one but I'm helping rewrite some of the internals of re react to be faster and more memory efficient and I don't know do did I know anything about how react Works before this no did I have any of the terminology about how react Works internally no have I ever looked at a vdom ever in my lifetime no was I able to help out yes I made a I got the first thing I did was to add a little sweet algorithm uh the crisal algorithm uh the path compression part of it I was able to add to help uh efficient lookup of child positioning it was fun it was awesome absolutely loved doing it and now there's a lot more I get to do today I get to look about uh you know reactive context as we call it which is just being able to kind of understand the state of where everything is as it renders right and how to make that smoother faster nicer you hate react and you work uh work to optimize it Life Is Life is Art but unknown to thee that's really what it is um the name is I really don't like react okay stop okay I don't I don't like react okay I I think solid JS is better just intrinsically but hey man I'll still try to make it fastag genin blazingly fast
