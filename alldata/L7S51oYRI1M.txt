[Music] when you're a beginner learning to code one of the biggest things is going to determine whether you succeed or fail is the quality of your questions and one of the most common questions that beginners ask me all the time is what is the best programming language for me to learn first and listen that makes sense like if you're gonna put in all of this time and effort into learning and coding a language you don't want to pick wrong do you but that's not actually the best question that you should be asking the better question that you should really be asking is what are your goals and it is the answer to this question that will actually inform the answer to the question that you were asking in the first place which is which language should you learn so in this video I'm going to be giving you the top five programming languages to learn in the order that I see them in 2023 in the situation in the world that we live in today and not only that for each of them I will tell you exactly what kind of person and for what kinds of goals each of these languages are best for depending on what you will want specifically if you watch this video all the way through you should hopefully be able to answer the question very definitively of which language you should be stuck starting with it for your particular situation like at the end of the day whichever one of these languages you're trying to learn learning the code is actually pretty damn simple it's not easy but it's simple all you really have to do is pick a course then pick a few projects that's literally all you do and you just stick to it for like four months you will know how to code by the end of it so then why is it that people struggle with this so incredibly much and I would argue that is because most coding courses suck a lot of these technical topics can be hard to explain in a way that's understandable and most importantly engaging and the only platform that I found that consistently delivers on this is zero to Mastery and yes I did accept that offer to sponsor this video but honestly these are the specific courses that I've done the most in my own Journey for instance you can take the complete web developer 2023 course that will literally take you from zero to job ready within one course with zero to Mastery you have access to 10 000 lessons almost a thousand hours of content of 48 courses everything from JavaScript to machine learning and if you use my link down below with my special discount code for 10 off you get access to all of these for literally less than the price of a couple of cups of coffee a month I don't know how long this discount code is going to be available for so I would definitely suggest using it very soon for specific course options check out the links down below now let's move on to the first language to learn in 2023. first on the list is Java so if I was to describe Java in one sentence it would be boring but effective it sort of clumps into right not very elegant to be honest if I'm completely honest with you it's a complete pain before I freaking hate writing Java but it is very fitting me a language that is used in a lot of very big Enterprise systems to think like big back-end systems of like big Banks or like big corporate systems and it also has a lot of longevity just do the fact that Java is so old and so popular amongst all these big corporations there is a very large supply of very competent Java developers so a lot of companies for that reason alone are simply choosing to stick with Java because their teams and the developers they have access to know the language so well if that's what you're looking for Java could be a great option Java is sort of like investing in the S P 500 rather than investing in like Bitcoin or anything like that it's not flashy it's not going to make you rich overnight but is it effective safe long-term choice but God damn I really hope I never have to see the words public static void ever again in my life next on the list we have a c so then for those of us who are perhaps looking to maybe delve into more of the Cs fundamentals or you're not maybe optimizing for practicality but rather like intellectual curiosity or like you want to learn how computers work learn like very low level stuff for these kinds of people CE slash like C plus plus or really the languages that you should be going with the reason is that when we're getting ready to all of those stuff like memory management you want to have a language that is actually forcing you to do these things manually because a lot of these higher level languages like python JavaScript they hide a lot of this stuff from you for practical reasons but if you're wanting to learn these things and how they work you want to actually use a language that's a bit more like clumsy a bit more manual like CES CNC plus plus are also great if you're looking to get jobs in like these lower level kind of programming areas for example I've listened to some podcasts with Elon Musk and what he has said is that the way they're building their Auto driving cars that they first build them using Python and then for optimization they will then convert the final code into a low-level language like C so for these sort of what we call embedded system like the software inside of cars or inside of this microphone is probably written in something like C because these things don't have the benefit of super fast processors so they need to use a lower level language like C to compensate for that so if these are the the types of things that you may be interested in working in personally not for me but if you are then C is your choice and place number three we have something for the hipsters those of you who want to try something relatively new and exciting and this is a language called go or golang it's a language that I myself have not learned yet but like when I was doing research for this video go kept coming up more and more as a language that's very much on the rise like if you're looking to maybe look in the future like what could be the big things in the future go or slash gol golang it could be like maybe a slightly riskier choice but not really anymore because it is gaining popularity so much it's also really easy to learn the syntax is built like sort of in a similar philosophy as python I guess it's very human readable and easy for humans to learn very fast and perhaps most interesting to you if you look at a lot of the readables of like the best paid languages gold tends to often be at the top but there's not enough good group programmers yeah so this could be a great opportunity for you to capitalize on and with that ladies and gentlemen when we get into the top two and I believe these next two languages really do still stand Head and Shoulders above all the other ones again generally I would say for most people's goals my first of which is Javascript if you're really looking for the widest range of job opportunities or you're looking to build the next app and you don't quite know exactly what it's going to be yeah and you just want to learn the language with the widest range of possibilities available to you you really cannot beat JavaScript because literally the entire front end of the entire internet is built using JavaScript so if you want to build anything web related which is like pretty much every app out there you're going to have to learn JavaScript at some point anywhere as like a secondary language like I did usually for any kind of apps or Services they usually first build a web app rather than going for like a mobile app for all of these reasons JavaScript is one of the most in demand languages in the world and it's also something that can be learned quite quickly and it's a lot of these web Developer jobs don't require any like fancy computer science backgrounds or anything like that I wouldn't say it's the best for really mastering programming fundamentals though because it has a lot of these like quirks and it's sort of annoying sometimes a bit weird the way it behaves sometimes but if you're simply looking to be line for an entry-level web based role then JavaScript should be your choice but with that said if you were holding a gun to my head and you were telling me like in the most General sense what is the number one language that I should learn in 2023 the one that I would still say is of course python my favorite language is my first language as well and to me it is still the king of all programming languages now there's a couple of reasons why firstly it's easy to learn it's really the best language for mastering a programming fundamentals there's no like semicolons like Curly blazes and all these like syntax that really is not useful sort of design is such a way where when you writing python code it feels like you're just writing English which is exactly what you want speed of coding rather than the speed of execution and number two it is ridiculously high demand and especially if you look into the future like what are the areas of programming actually becoming more and more popular with a lot of data Ai and machine learning related fields and all of these fields are absolutely dominated by python we are living in the age of the information so if you want to hedge yourself against the risk of perhaps AR replacing the option of this I think the best way to do that is to understand the language in which AI is written so you can be the one replacing jobs rather than the one being replaced and thirdly python allows you to Simply build things really fast there's so many libraries that are out there if you can get your resume projects done twice as fast that means you can get jobs twice as far as well the one thing about python that I almost forgot to talk about here is that if you are applying for these jobs with these like Fang style data action algorithm interview by far the best language for you to master for these interviews is python because in these situations when you're under time pressure and you need to solve these coding problems very quickly you don't want to have to focus on syntax like oh where am I going to put a semicolon all of these well you want a language that makes actually writing the code as simple and easy as possible with as few lines of code as possible and give you the best possible chance of passing these interviews for each and every one of these languages I've left the courses that I recommend for you to take to learn them down below in the description below for JavaScript I honestly don't think you can beat zero to master is offering to have their Flagship web developable bootcamp they have the react Bootcamp The node.js the advanced JavaScript course and their 10 JavaScript projects course so literally with that one subscription you can do all of these and be a very very competent JavaScript programmer at the end of it so that's why I'm not trying to compete with them as a python however the language that I have the most love for these are the courses that I'm when I make myself and in fact my first one Python Programming fundamentals is live this course alone will literally take you from zero to a competent Python program in the shortest amount of time out of any course out there I also go over the three key qualities of great programmers like trust me I've seen the difference between programmers who fail and the kinds of programmers that companies actually want to hire and if literally you do nothing else which purchase instill three three qualities in your own life you are going to be a very very competent programmers that companies really really want but guys like I said there is unfortunately no one size fits all answer this question it all depends on what do you want to do and what are your goals with programming but at the same time don't think too hard about what language you choose at the end of the day there is no such thing as a best language except there is I mean python is the best but other than that there's no best language except other than that JavaScript is really the best language but there's no such thing as a bad language I mean Java is pretty the trash PHP sucks as well but just pick one language and stick to it but make sure you pick python if you do pick python which you should you should next watch this video where I explain to you exactly how you can Master the Python programming language in 2023. with that I'll see you in the next week's upload [Music] foreign [Music]
