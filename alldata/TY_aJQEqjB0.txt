okay so let's talk about film crew jobs because for a while now if you've been learning anything about cameras or storytelling from YouTube it all seems to fall under this one umbrella job of filmmaker I mean I say that word all the time on this channel so it's not like I'm against the word or anything but there's just one problem it doesn't really mean anything at least not in the context of a professional crew and that's because there aren't that many professional caliber films made by just one person meaning that there is no one filmmaker instead there's a film crew made up of a bunch of people who have a very specific job and are hopefully really good at that one thing sometimes a project really is just made by one person doing it all themselves but for the majority of documentaries you've seen on TV that's probably not the case that should be good news though because it means there are a bunch of jobs on a documentary team and not just one all powerful filmmaker and depending on what you're good at these jobs can be incredibly satisfying very well paying and get you on set where the real learning and professional growth happens so in this this video I'm going to break down the different jobs you can get in a documentary film crew how you can get that job and then I'll share a few tips on how to do that job well because even though I'm a director and cinematographer these days I didn't start there and over my 10 plus year journey to get where I am now I've learned quite a bit about how this whole crazy business works so let's get right into it because there are a bunch of jobs to cover in this one and not a lot of time before I launch right into it I'll just say that for this video I'm only going to be talking about the key roles for the field team I.E the people who are actually shooting the project there's a whole bunch of jobs that are back in the office from production managers to editors but we'll save those for another video because I'm assuming that a lot of you watching this channel are going to want to work in the field Maybe I'm Wrong there but that's just my guess I'm also not going to get into rates and pay for these jobs here because there's a lot to get through already and it's just going to make things way too long I already broke all these rates down in the professional development unit of my documentary cinematography course and the next intake is going to open in early March so if you want more specifics on that you can jump on the waiting list but for now I'll just say that there are a ton of variations here and there are no rules on how a dock crew is made up like you might have four producers and no sound people though I really hope for your sake you don't this isn't a guide to how things must work it's about identifying the core roles and how you might be able to get those jobs yourself depending on your goals all right start the timer okay so jumping right into it and starting at the bottom of the pecking order is a that many a future filmmaker got their start in and that's a pa pa stands for production assistant and their job is basically to do anything that's asked of them that could be driving or picking up coffee or ordering lunch hauling gear in and out of locations running around trying to get release form signed the best thing about paing apart from getting paid is that you're exposed to every person on the crew and so you can learn a lot about how the overall process works and since most careers are built off the back of Word of Mouth the more people you meet the the more likely you are to get recommended for the next gig to get a PA job in documentaries you'll likely want to approach medium to large size production companies and also talk to production managers who work there individually docks are a little bit different than Hollywood because there is no Union and there's not many like open calls so you're much better off going straight to the source the production company Pas need to be hardworking easy to get along with and really adaptable because no two days are going to be alike you're probably going to want to use the PA job as a stepping stone to something else but for getting in at the ground level it is a great place to start next let's talk about the unsung heroes of the dock crew the people who actually make the whole thing happen the fixers if you've never heard of a fixer it's industry jargon for a local producer who arranges access and solves logistical problems for film Crews or journalists that aren't from the area without a good fixer a ton of the international projects that I've worked on over the years would never have happened and they deserve way more credit than they get most of the time to be a good fixer you need to be intimately familiar with your location so that means you have to speak the local language at near native level or at least really fluently and understand the local Customs laws and the political situation and so on the very best fixers usually have big networks as well and they can open doors just by calling the right people which is why so many of the good ones are former journalists or they're filmmakers themselves to get these jobs like to work as a fixer you need to become synonymous with your area so trying to lock in a domain name like Toronto fixer.com or something similar based on where you are would probably help a lot there are also a lot of job boards and public forums like I need a fixer.com or Facebook groups like the vulture club and if you ever find yourself on a crew working with a fixer always treat them with respect because without fixers you won't get very far at [Music] all the next job is one you might not find on every doc shoot and it's usually only on the big ones that have a budget for it but when you can afford it having a dit or media manager on set is always a treat a dit is a digital imaging TCH and in the doc world they're usually professional data Wranglers by which I mean they do the backups and sometimes make field notes for the Post team as footage rolls in in Hollywood they might also do some onset coloring or work on daili editing but generally speaking in docs a dit is mainly a media manager they're most common on high budget projects with a very high volume of footage being captured because if you're just dumping like three or four cards a day then there's no point in paying a dedicated crew member to do it but when you're ingesting 50 plus cards a day from one of 15 different Camas they can be a massive asset dits need to be extremely organized because any lost footage would be a disaster and they also need to be very detail oriented to keep track of the dozens and dozens of cards at the same time the good thing about this gig is that you often work really closely with the rest of the camera team plus you get to see the raw footage straight out of camera so you can start to understand how Pros are covering scenes and both of these are pretty serious perks if your long-term plan is to shoot and speaking of the camera Department next up is the job that I used to do a lot while I was still establishing myself in the industry that's a camera assistant or AC for sure documentary AC's are all around helpers for the camera operators and cinematographers like on a Hollywood set there are different levels of AC's with the first normally looking after Focus pulling the second dealing with lenses and Camera maintenance and then sometimes there's a third plus a trainee on top of that but in docs AC's are more Jack of all trade types sometimes the AC will help change lenses sometimes they'll be moving lights around sometimes they'll throw a camera or a drone in their hands and get them to help out if things get hectic to get work as an AC you'll want to be in touch with as many production managers as possible and also meet with as many DPS or camera operators as you can the DP can almost always choose who they want as an AC so if you're doing a good job or you make a good impression odds are you'll be brought on to the next project with them once I personally find a good AC I'll usually come back to the same person for years until they jump up themselves and start looking for assistance of their own a few keys to being a good AC are to be able to anticipate problems before they happen and stay extreme extremely organized so that the DP doesn't have to if you do those two things plus be friendly you'll be in huge demand before [Music] long okay staying in the camera Department we get to the camera operators themselves and there might just be one cam off per shoot or if it's a big production like I don't know Survivor or something there might be dozens typically the main shooter is referred to as the Director of Photography or DP for short though it is possible for the DP to not actually be the one holding a camera while they have a bunch of operators to do it for them that's more common on movie sets but in docs it's pretty rare normally whoever is the senior person making the decisions about the projects visuals will be called the DP and the rest of the shooters are camera operators it's also possible to have multiple DPS on a dock set and that tends to happen most when uh a couple of Shooters have a similar level of experience and they're sharing the responsibility rather than delegating it either way the DP is in charge of everything that has to do with how a film or show looks from the lighting to the lenses this also happens to be what I do as a day job most of the time and though I also direct sometimes if I'm getting paid it's usually as a DP now I personally think this is the most fun job on a doc crew but that might be because I have a background in photography and I love shooting being a doc DP is also a really physical job because you'll be putting in long days hauling gear around and doing really long scenes or interviews from the shoulder maybe on top of that if you specialize in documentaries like I do you'll also do this in all sorts of environments from like crowded cities to Cav to mountain tops I'm just about to do a shoot where we're going to hike nearly 20 m a day through the desert while carrying camera and camping gear so being a dotp is maybe for a different sort of personality type than working on commercials or feature films where you might be in a climate controlled Studio most of the time a good doc DP should obviously have a great eye but there's a lot more to the job than that like first and foremost you need great social skills partly to communicate with your team but mainly to gain the trust and confidence of the people you're filming who might be in AOL vulnerable or difficult position they're not actors and you only get to film what they show you so if your interpersonal skills are off it's going to be tough a good doc DP should also be fairly technically minded and be able to run all sorts of film making gear from cameras to drones to audio because a lot of the time pretty much everything technical is going to be considered part of your job to get started as a DP you have to shoot a lot to develop your eye of course but I'd probably suggest you try and start as an AC and learn from the ground level and make connections with more experienced operators and DPS before you try and land big jobs for yourself keep shooting share your work Network a ton and work for other people maybe even for free who know more than you if you stick at that for long enough and eventually you'll find work okay the next job is one that's sort of uncommon on all but the biggest projects that's someone who works side by side with the DP the gaffer it's pretty rare to find a dedicated gaffer on a documentary crew usually because a doc crew isn't big enough and they can't afford one but a gaffer if you've never never heard of it is the person who manages all the lighting a gaffer and a DP will usually work really closely together and build a look based on the available gear but honestly most of the time a doc DP will do the lighting by themselves if you do have the budget for a gaffer though they can be a massive help especially if you're doing high stakes interviews or things with celebrities and you absolutely need to nail the lighting a good gaffer speeds up everything and allows the DP to spend more time behind the camera designing the look of a frame because then you don't have to run out and adjust lights and move stands and stuff because someone else is doing that for you doesn't happen that often but whenever I find a call sheet with a gaffer on it I get really excited because it means I'm going to be able to get very creative with my look sadly it's pretty rare for me to have a gaffer on my team and maybe less than 10% of the jobs have one just because the budgets aren't there or maybe because we're working internationally and we want to keep the crew size small another person that works closely with the DP on a doc crew is the sound person and when there's a budget for sound they're the dp's best friend it's pretty self-explanatory but a sound person runs all the lav mics and usually manually operates a boom mic as well to make sure that a project has the very best audio Possible having sound on set frees up the DP to focus exclusively on the visuals and scene coverage without ever worrying about monitoring Wireless feeds or any of the other things like that since sound is just as important as the visuals in a dock hiring a dedicated sound person is always a great idea if your budget allows it the only issue Beyond money is that it does increase the size of the crew and having someone run around with a boom pole really UPS the profile of a shoe lots of people will ignore a camera in a crowd but as soon as someone starts flying in an overhead boom mic the attention tends to go way up so for lowprofile jobs they often get left behind despite how helpful they are a good sound person needs to be unobtrusive I mean if that's possible while holding a boom and they should have really good situational awareness so that they don't mess up the shot by getting themselves or their boom in the way and they also really need to be very focused because sometimes they're going to be be monitoring multiple audio feeds at once and they have to keep them all balanced now what I'm going to say next is going to make some people mad I'm pretty sure but sound is one of the easier jobs to break into because in the beginning the main requirement is that you have sound gear and a basic idea of how to use it I'm not devaluing the work they do because a pro will bring a bunch of skills to the table but in the earlier career stages where there are way fewer people who own professional sound gear than there are people with cameras it can be a little bit easier to get your foot in the door if you have gear and you can use it there's a lot less competition than if you're trying to get into the camera department and it can be a great way to get on set get a mixer a bag three to four lav kits a good shotgun and a boom pole then you can start advertising yourself for higher to get really good at it is a totally different thing but the barrier to entry is largely technical which is good news if you're just getting started I can already hear the rage Brewing from sound guys in the comments but before you start explaining to me all the ways I'm wrong just know that I love you the the one person I'm going to put on this list that is sometimes in the field with the crew but sometimes not is the production manager and they're the ones that hold most shoots together sometimes the production manager will travel with the team and sometimes they stay in the office managing Logistics but either way they act as the communication and organizational Hub of a team they're usually the ones who organize flights and book hotels arrange visas Reserve shooting locations and set the schedules based on the subject's availability like the job title says they manage the shoot and make sure it keeps running PMS have one of the hardest jobs because the consequences for getting something wrong are often really high and if they do their job well most people won't even notice but if you can make order out of chaos and like dealing with people this could actually be a great gig a lot of PMS have Ambitions to move on to either a producer or executive producers role or maybe a director but there are also full-time PMS who are great at what they do now managing Logistics is my personal Nightmare and I would be a terrible PM but if you're trying to break into nearly any part of the doc business they are probably the best people to get to know like if you're trying to get work as an AC or a PA or a sound person often it's up to the production manager to help Source them locally so the more PMS you know the more likely you are to get gigs so be nice to your production manager their job is probably terrible and if you ever work with a bad one you'll realize just how important they are to the smoothness of a shoot so if a DP is responsible for what a project looks like the person in charge of How It's actually made is the producer and in this video I'm talking about field producers not executive producers or story producers who tend to stay in the office more now I found that producer is probably the most misunderstood job for people not in the business and no one seems to know really what they do well the answer is that they do almost anything when it comes to making sure a story gets finished they'll help with on the ground Logistics and adjust the schedule on the Fly Like if an interview runs long or the director changes their mind about something they might communicate with the production office and normally they're sort of the main point of contact between the office and the field crew they monitor story points and the script to make sure the director isn't missing important questions or that you're not missing any elements in a certain scene a producer does anything and everything needed short of filming the thing themselves to make sure a shoot goes well maybe that's why it's so confusing because they don't have one limited job description but if you really had to boil it down their job is to make sure things get done producers need great communication skills when dealing with people but they also need to understand the film making and storytelling process broadly so that they can way in when the director needs another opinion producers directors and DPS form a sort of creative triangle that make the big decisions on location and the best of them will take an active role in the process to get a producer's job it's a good idea to start out as a PA then maybe move to production manager or Junior producer sometimes called an associate producer and then you'll eventually get bumped a full producer if you do well an executive producer does something really different and they're usually the ones in charge of the finance and distribution but it's pretty rare for them to come out in the field so I'm not going to say any more about them for now finally last but not least is the big boss the director the director of a doc is quite different than on a fiction movie where the director's main job is to work with the actors to get the right performance out of them but in docs there are no actors obviously so if the dp's job deals with what a story looks like and the producer is how that story gets made the director's job is to decide what story are we actually telling a documentary director will work ahead of the shoot to create a rough script or outline and to establish Lish the story so that everybody knows what we're trying to make they'll work with the producer and production manager to figure out the best people to talk to and the best places to visit and also with the DP to create a visual style that they like a director has to have a central vision for the finished product and then work with the team to keep everyone on track directors also usually ask the questions in an interview which I guess is the doc equivalent of working with actors and it's up to them to really establish good relationships with the characters to gain trust and access I've been been on a bunch of projects or at least a couple of projects where the director has had a great idea for a story but doesn't necessarily have the trust of the people in it and then the whole thing just doesn't work so a good director needs to have great social skills a strong sense of story and enough broad knowledge to be able to well direct everyone else a Bad director micromanages everything and looks over other people's shoulders whereas a good one brings together talented people and then lets them do their jobs while clearly communicating the larger Vision to become a director is is both the easiest and the hardest of all jobs because anyone who goes out and makes a film is technically a director when people use that buzzword filmmaker they're usually talking about a director if you just want to direct your own projects then you don't need any permission at all just go out and do it just go make a film and boom you're a director if you want to direct a large scale production though and get paid for it then that's a different story and it takes years to get there if you want to be a director on a professional crew the good news is that you can start in pretty much any position and then work your way up over time you can become a director with a background in producing or shooting so it's more a matter of gaining overall experience and having a great Network and a strong sense of story than it is about a linear path up the ranks the other way is by making your own stuff that generates a lot of buzz on the festival circuit or sells to a big distributor which then proves you can do the job and then people might just come to you and offer you the job if your ultimate goal is to be a director the path forwards is really just to get good at film making to be able to tell good stor and to be good at gaining people's trust other than that there aren't really any rules how to get the top job okay how am I doing with time did I make it probably not but I did my best anyways those are all the main jobs on a doc crew explained and I hope that was helpful in demystifying what all those people are actually doing on set at the core of getting any of these jobs is networking and no amount of gear or desire will help you if you don't get out there and meet people and make work if you do want help with how to network you can use my my full 12-page networking guide that's linked for free in the description but it's really the most important part of Landing a film job at the end of the day whether you like it or not so get out there meet people and don't be scared to start at the bottom and eventually you'll work your way up to the job that you want see [Music] you
