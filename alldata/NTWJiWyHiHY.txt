new in Python 3.12 we have the option to Nest F strings in a much more convenient way in the past we would have to switch between triple quotation marks and triple single quotation marks and then we would have to use single quotation marks and then double quotation marks just to be able to Nest these FST strings but now as of python 3.12 we don't have to do this anymore we can act as adults and just Nest them normally so we will create something called my string two which will be of type string and then we can start doing what we would usually do by adding some curly brackets and then nesting another FST string and adding some curly brackets and doing this over and over and over without any issues and we can add 1 + one inside there and this will work perfectly fine so now we can easily Nest our F strings without having to worry about these quotation marks and we can actually run both my string and my string 2 and when we do that inside the the console we will get the same result so I mean now you can do things such as 1+ one or the string of 1+ 1 plus hello and if we run that we will get to hello because now we are dealing with Logic on different levels of these FST strings so that was an incredibly simple change that they brought to python 3.12 I've never had the idea or even had the intention of nesting my FST strings so I'm incredibly curious to hear what you guys think about this new feature in the comment section down below but as always thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video
