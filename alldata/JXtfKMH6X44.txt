So obviously as a mathematician and a physicist we're all very used to to sort of playing around with Greek letters. Omicron's a bit of an unusual one, right? As you probably know the the all the Covid variants are named after these these Greek letters and they've been going along in order. They got to the Mu variant and then they skipped two and went to Omicron. Obviously the first thing you want to ask is why did they skip skip two? Well the next letter after after Mu was was Nu and they did they thought that was too close to to 'new' as in something big brand new. One after that was Xi which was thought to be too close to the name of the Chinese president. 
So they thought that was a bit bad, nobody wants to be associated with the Covid variant so they they went straight to Omicron or at least that's the theory that's why they did it. Omicron's bit of a weird Greek letter, it's not one that we see that often in as you know in maths but it does exist and it does have a bit of history which I think is is quite interesting to talk about, and certainly more pleasant to talk about I think than uh the Covid virus. Well I think we should go all the way back to the to the second century with Ptolemy who was a, you know, he wrote this Almagest which was this big sort of article on astronomy. And he was using Omicron there. One thing we have to do is we have to understand a little bit about how the Greeks wrote their numbers. They had this kind of alphabetic system; so for example Alpha represented 1, Beta represented 2, Gamma represented 3 and so on. And they went like that until they got up to up to ten, so it went up one to nine. They had special letters for 10, special letters for 20, special letters for 30, and so on; and then they 
would just pile it all together. So I can give you an example maybe just to illustrate it; the number 666 - 666, devil's number. So a Chi and then I think this is a Xi and then a Zeta, and then they'd put a line over the top. And what this means is- so this represents the number 6, this represents the number 60 and this represents 600, okay, so 666, we put it all together. Incidentally Omicron does appear in this, okay? It appears as the number 70. Okay so Omicron which is just more like that- (Brady: What's it look like?)
- Well it's like- it's like an O basically. But it also had another interesting use, or people have theorised that it had another interesting use, in Ptolemy's system. So what Ptolemy did is he also wanted to- he was trying to describe astronomical systems and he was thinking about you know sort of the angles in the sky basically. So of course you have 360 degrees, you then have sort of 60 minutes and 60 seconds. That that basically meant he was working with kind of like a sexa-decimal number system. So he needed a way to sort of write those sort of
1/60th and 160th squared; i.e either minutes and the and the seconds. So suppose we wanted
to do like 80 degrees 41 minutes and three seconds, just for you know pick a random one okay. How would you write- how would Ptolemy have written that? So he would have done the 80 okay, so the symbol for 80 is is pi, so you'd have to put a pi in there. They'd have had a new column. 
- (Why is there a) (line above it by the way?) That's to distinguish it from the from the actual letters, okay, so they put the lines above it for the numbers, okay. 80 is is is pi so that goes in the first column because that's the number of degrees. Second column, so now we need to do 41 okay? So 40 is Mu and there one is Alpha so that's written like that. So that's that's 40 plus 1. And then 3 is is Gamma so we put a Gamma in there. Okay so this this is how he would have written it, this positional system. Then you have to ask the question, right, well what if I didn't have any minutes? What if I had zero minutes? Okay. So didn't really have a symbol for that well then so he said what what Ptolemy used was- well he used this symbol, which people have said is an Omicron. Now there's a lot of debate about this, because some people say, well is it an Omicron? How could it be a Omicron? Omicron's already 70. But maybe it was an Omicron because you couldn't put a 70 in any of these columns anyway, because they only went up to 60 right? You know 59. It didn't really- he could have got away with using an Omicron there.
- (It was like the first) (symbol available to him that
didn't have a use?) Yeah yeah. Well it had a use - you could you could put an Omicron in this column right? Because you could have 70 degrees, but it's but it wouldn't make sense to have a 70 in either of these columns right, because they only go up to 59. There's a bit of arguing about this and another reason people say he might have used Omicron is that the Greek word for nothing or none is called Ουδέν, right, which begins with an Omicron in Greek. So so it kind of fitted in. So obviously because of this then people start to speculate, well this does look a little bit like our 0 right? A lot actually, like a lot. So people speculate, well are they connected? But there's really no evidence that they are connected, in fact almost certainly not connected it's probably just a massive coincidence because I think obviously traditionally people talk about that our 0 came from much further east, from India so it's almost certainly a massive coincidence but that's this ancient use of of Omicron. So now I think we need to get a little bit more modern. More recently, where has Omicron popped up in the mathematical literature? Okay so I know you've come across Donald Knuth before, the great sort of computer scientist from from Stanford. Obviously we've seen him in the arrow notation, the famous arrow notation which we use for graham's number, so that's pretty cool. He has this really wonderfully cantankerous paper about Omicron and its use in the 
mathematical literature- I love this paper it's so it's just so angry it's great. I've got it here, so this is this is the paper. Well I say it's modern but I mean it was came out the year after I was born so it's not that modern, 1976. Here we are, so the title of the paper is 'Big Omicron, Big Omega and Big Theta'. 
The reason he wrote this paper was because he was really getting a bit fed up with the way people were misusing Omicron in the mathematical literature, and Omegas as well actually. And he basically decided that somebody needed to fix the literature to sort out all the language that people were using and
normalise it and that's the point of his cantankerous paper which literally just sets the sort of rules of what people should be using. So what is Omicron, and I guess Omega and Theta, to Donald Knuth? Well let me explain. It's to do with how sort of fast things grow. If I say that something is Omicron, big Omicron, some people call it Big O but he calls it Omicron so we're going to go with that. If something says that big Omicron n squared what does that mean? This means all the functions which are bounded above; so they're essentially smaller than things that grow like n squared. So let me let me do it graphically, so maybe that will explain. So suppose you've got- we're going to send n to infinity okay, so we're going to make n really really big. So let me just draw n squared okay? Grows like that okay? Or this could be some multiple of n squared, this could be some- you know, some number m times n squared. Now all the functions that this means, what does this actually mean, it means all the functions which don't quite grow as big as that. They don't get they don't get as big as quickly as that. So they might do this; so they might go above in you know at small values of m but eventually when you get big enough they don't grow as fast, they always stay below some curve which is a multiple of n squared. So there's always a curve which is some multiple of n squared which they stay behind, and that's what this this notation means okay? Now it's important notation for sort of thinking about how sort of systems, you know- maybe if you've got an algorithm and you want to work out how how sort of efficient it is; so we've got to sort out n things and you want to know, well, how quickly does how many steps do I need to use? Is it order n? Is it this is it this this order n squared? Or is it is it some other something else? It gives you a feel for that, so it's really important in that kind of thing. So obviously you can put any function in here right, okay, so you could do order n cubed or the you know or any any other function that- log n,
anything right. And you're just basically saying that the the functions that you're talking about don't grow as fast as some multiple of that thing. What about the other things that he's talked about in the paper? Well they're kind of quite simple so he has- you can imagine something like Omega of n squared, that's kind of the other way around, they're the things that go faster than it okay.
- (The other side of the line.) The other side of the line. So something like this, so this would basically say there was stuff which is also growing like you know some other n here. That they're always bigger than some other number times n squared, so they stay the other side of the line. They can always find something which is growing like n squared, some multiple of n squared which- and this guys will grow faster. Then Theta which is the last one of the list, that means you're talking about all the functions which are above something that grows like n squared, some multiple of n squared, and below some other multiple of n squared. So they're kind of bounded on either side. These ones tell you all the functions that are below, these ones tell you all the functions that are above, and these ones tell you all the functions that are in between for some choice of m and n and primed as I've written it. 
- (So with) (Omicron and Omega we don't need two) (lines do we, because they don't have to) (be between, but with
Theta there needs to) (be two-) (two lines to define our-)
- Exactly, exactly. So the Theta's kind of more precise, it tells you it's really telling you an awful lot of information that it's really really growing like some multiple of n squared so it's really trapped between, you know, that grow- two different growth rates which are very alike. Whereas the other two sort of just give you an upper bound or a lower bound. There's another area where these are used, you don't just have to take things to infinity to use this notation, you can take things to to constants or to zero; and that's where I tended to come across this notation, this this Omicron. And you could say, well what is Omicron of x squared as x goes to zero? This basically means all the functions which are smaller than x squared, okay? So then they're bounded above by x squared so things like x- as x goes to zero, so you can think things like x cubed or x to the four. So as x goes to zero they're always going- they're not growing as fast as x squared, but it's the same kind of idea. So for example let's- let's draw the graph again, let's draw something which goes like x squared which is- which can be 4 times x squared, or 5 times x squared, it's just a multiple of x squared. And we want all the functions which are- we're going to x equals 0 now, so we're interested in what's happening down here. Okay, we're in the functions that are like an x cubed which down here is is growing more slowly, okay. So all the functions which are trapped down here but we're interested in what's happening down down below okay, near zero.
- (Because eventually x cubed will) (over-) (in the other direction- )
- It'll overtake, yeah absolutely absolutely. Yeah so you couldn't have it- it's only a statement about what happens to x equals zero. So yes you see here, so here we're interested in staying below as we go to large values, here we're interested in staying below as you go to small values but you can use the same notation for each, it just says you're bounded above by by this thing by these this functions which go like x squared or two times x squared or three times x squared okay. And of course you can apply the same; the Omega and the Theta language there too. And this is really common in physics actually to use this. We use it in perturbation theory, one thing we do in physics is is perturbation theory which is where you take small stuff. So you- so to actually do anything you take really small quantities and you expanded it, you sort of consider the the first correction in that quantity. Some things like- let me give you an example: quantum electrodynamics. We have a small number in quantum electrodynamics which is the fine- structure constant, which is 1 over 137, that's a small number. So what you can do is you can calculate things to some sort of degree of accuracy in the fine-structure constant. So if we want like roughly a 1% accuracy we only need to take the first correction that's linear in the fine- structure constant. And then we can go to higher order, to things that go like the square of the fine-structure constant that would give us like 1% of 1% accuracy roughly. And you can go higher and use this perturbation theory. And that's how you do physics, that's how you do physics, you can't read- without perturbation theory physicists are useless, okay? Right so so we really need- and obviously this kind of language which is telling you how- what are all the things that you're sweeping under the carpet that you're ignoring, what are all- how fast are they growing? What are they bounded above by? If we were talking about something like the fine-structure constant we might say, oh those terms are order Alpha squared, you know, so we put an Omicron Alpha squared or 
Omega Alpha cubed. They're the things, so everything that we've swept under the carpet that we're ignoring, they're bounded above by this thing, okay, functions which grow like this thing. And that's the idea of a- so this is this is the use of Omicron in in in maths and physics. (When they named this new
variant Omicron did you) (straight away go, oh yeah I know that) (symbol, I use it all the time in physics?) Well I don't- see this is the thing, funnily enough I don't think it does get used. I never thought- I've used this all the time right, this this notation is so common right; I use it in
my lectures, I use it all the time when I'm writing stuff. I never thought of it as an Omicron really, I never- it never occurred to me that it was an Omicron. 
Oh it's just an O, right? You know, but, it's an Omicron apparently according to 
Donald. That's what it is, I should think of it as an Omicron which I'm more than happy to do now. I saw some debate on social media, people say, oh we need- all need to start writing papers with Omicrons now. Everyone's like, everybody's already doing it, it's like you just didn't realise so I think that's quite cool. Waiting for your chance to talk about it, what book is this here? This is a book called the Almagest by Ptolemy, and this particular edition is very very old, 1515 is the publication date for this. It is the first published edition of this book. The book itself was actually written in about 150 AD. So I was asked on twitter to calculate the number of SARS-Cov-2 particles, the particles that caused Covid-19, how many they were in the world? And so I did the calculation and it turns out that there are few enough to fit inside a regular can of coke.
