ladies and gentlemen chess is a beautiful magical mysterious and captivating game with a very rich history and some very rich personalities who have played it over the years and one of those personalities is named mik tal he is known as the Magician of Ria because his chess was magical and he was born in Ria shocking m t had a fascinating playing style and he was just an incredible individual as well with a fascinating story I made a video a while ago called the man who invented brilliant moves so if you haven't seen that video it's worth watching but in this video we're uncovering a fascinating detail about mik's life and in particular when he got The Grandmaster title you see if you are a chess fan or you're not a chess fan at all this is one of your first chess videos we have a title it's called grandmas it's the ultimate title but The Grandmaster title has not even existed for 100 years in fact it's only been about 75 it was only officially first recognized in 1950 and Tyle didn't have The Grandmaster title he received The Grandmaster title in 1957 because of one tournament he played one tournament and he won it the USSR Championship the championship of the Soviet Union 21 games 22 players 21 games it was round robin he won first place with 14 points only at the age of 20 he was a 20-year-old winning the Soviet Chess Championship against killers and in today's video I'm going to show you several of those games from the 1957 USSR Championship the one tournament that convinced everybody to wave the restrictions and give mik tal The Grandmaster title can you imagine you play one tournament and they go damn okay that's all it took this G this these games I've got four games for you these are unbelievable games uh T just had this just just this Aura and he got it done in so many different ways so sit back relax uh and uh let me take you down uh this history Road I I I know um a lot of you enjoy historical chess videos so one of his opponents was named uh bhuti ganza and the fascinating thing about ganza is that he was one of the original Georgian Grand Masters he was a 12-time national champion of Georgia and he invented multiple openings there is an opening in the caroon defense after D4 D5 Knight C3 G6 which is literally called the ganza which is named after him can you imagine you made an entire opening and it gets played into the modern era now back in the day Lanza played D4 with the white pieces but that is what he used to play with black T played Knight F6 C4 and T played C5 and an invitation to play the bonon defense after D5 and E6 nowadays this is considered a slightly dubious very slightly dubious way to play at the ultra Elite level because white maintains a very nice space advantage in the center but it's microscopic and if it fits your playing style you should play it Black's entire approach is based on the open E file as well as putting the bishop on this diagonal and because white moved a flank Pawn into the center white has a center advantage of two pawns versus one but black does get some flank play with his pawns so let's put all of that to work T plays Bishop G7 Bishop E2 both sides Castle you see both sides getting their kings to safety which you know you have to do Rook E8 targets the pawn Knight D2 you may wonder why ganza moved his Knight to D2 blocking his Queen and Bishop well he wants to support his pawn and the Knight is going to go there in conjunction with the move A4 suppressing what black wants and from this Square the Knight pressures the queen side and the weak Pawn on D6 so every chess opening comes with a starter kit of this is what you should do with white right and this is what you should do with black and for a while you will follow games that have happened already and then you will leave that territory and then it's up to you right Knight A6 a weird move simultaneously maybe threatening to come forward uh also opting to go backwards to apply pressure to the center and support this move B5 that's exactly what T does right we see white doing exactly what he's supposed to do uh which is control the B5 advance and now in this position we have B6 tal basically says look I'm not going to be able to play this uh in one go so we're going to very slowly build all of this up Gorgon needs have played Queen C2 just a very you know simple straightforward standard idea uh which is trying to support the center and now he will expand now here tal decided n G4 and T decided I need to end up in a Gotham YouTube video some 67 years later 57 43 43 24 67 yes Knight to G4 basically saying look uh bukti you you you've got to you've got to take my KN my knight is Annoying It's targeting a lot of things near your king but I don't want to take your knight why would I just recreationally trade the bishop for the Knight there Bishops are better than Knights right that's what he should have done though and then he would have started applying pressure with his Knights instead of that he he messed with t and he played H3 and he was like Misha what's the Knight doing here like I what is the point you going to put it on E5 next I don't understand nope mik tal sacrificed his Knight if you left things near your king that were only protected by your king this man would ruin your life now the best move for white is literally to ignore the Knight yeah boui was like dude what is he is this guy like on something like he probably inhaled the fumes of the samovar uh it's what they used to make t Bishop uh Queen H4 check King F1 but now what I don't well that was the thing if you mess with Misha then you know you uh you would face all your demons Bishop D4 the threat is made but so what Knight D1 and buhui had clearly calculated that there is no Checkmate so now Mikel is going to sacrifice his Bishop which makes sense right but he's not going to take if you take his mate I understand but then he was going to go Rook here the bishop would have went back and then bahoi would have played like Knight E3 and the game would have continued what he had failed to realize when Mikel played this move was Mikel is is deviant he thinks all the wrong things in chess he finds all the moves nobody thinks of and mik tal had seen in this position that he's not going to sacrifice the bishop to open up the king he will sacrifice the queen and that presents a very unique set of problems because if you had sacrificed the bishop I don't have to take you but if you sacrifice the queen I don't have to take you cuz I get mated but this comes with a very unique set of problems bukusi now defends himself but here comes Queen H2 and it is an avalanche pouring into the white position Knight C4 the center is opened up the clouds are opening the bishop is sniping you from the other diangle and it's just a matter of time Rook to E5 you can't take it because you're pinned here comes the other rook and mik T is is just bulldozing you with 25 points of attacking mechanism and then just when you thought he his he has one piece tal has one piece that he hasn't moved yet and he gets it in the game oh my goodness that move doesn't even look possible because you can just take Rook takes you can't take with the Knight because you open up the diagonal and queen G1 is mate this man mishal would just get all of his Pieces Just pieces that were dead they were just gone they were standing around Knight D5 Rook D5 he bulldozes the white position and he forces a resignation after 27 moves because once you take the Queen Once you take with the queen it's check and it's mate oh my God oh my God and we are just getting started this man really played Queen H3 against one of the legends of the game Gorgan just unbelievable his tactical Vision his you you couldn't let him get going you know now this is a fascinating match up this is T who is a dynamic genius a a an attacking Powerhouse up against probably the best defensive player of all time you can argue nowadays it's like Hikaru like you know you can argue that Hikaru is is one of the most you know best defensive but at the time petan petan tigran vovi petan was just just on another level so he played a French defense this is a wau and uh it's a line where black takes the Knight damages White's Pawn structure and we get into a very fascinating game where white is sort of pushed back takes on D4 and this looks like a very Dynamic complicated position and and and tal is trying to make it that I mean tal is trying to give up all his pawns right and then he's trying to create an attack yeah uh petan knows better he he's like I'm not going to get into all of that yeah look at just G4 just throwing all the pieces forward taking on H5 opening up the G file to create some sort of attack but again pjan one of the best defensive players in the world he's like nope look at this I'm utilizing moves that don't even look possible and now we're going to get stability the position has stabilized one of the best attacking players of that generation versus one of the best defenders it's like sports right it's like sports I mean it's like in tennis a player has a tool that that they like to use versus a tool of the opponent it's it's it you know it's hitting head on right like what happens when when uh the best offensive team in a sport plays the best defensive team it's what we have now we have stability these pawns are kind of stuck this Pawn is stuck T is going to try to put pressure over here can he blow petran just completely out of the water I don't know Queen G5 petran going for an end game he's giving away the pawn on G7 you see if petran played King f8 here then after Rook G1 it's really difficult to defend this Pawn right you're just going to so he's like all right take the pawn me take the pawn you you think you think I need the pawn I don't need the pawn queen f f let's trade Queens Misha's like nope P Shan's like no seriously let's trade Queens Mish is like nope we're doing it on my terms and petan knows if he can get the Queens off if he can get a little stability he's going to be all right he's going to be all right in the long run he gets the bishop into the game all right petan uh T starts bringing his King now the amazing thing here here T finds an idea that is wild he he finds a way to March his King into the center of the board it's an end game but it's a very imbalanced end game where there's a lot of like open lines to the other party there's weird structures like this Pawn is here for some reason it's kind of the remnants of playing a wow French right now the move H6 is highly preferred by stockfish you can't take because of Czech and I win The Rook but the other idea is to sneak the pawn to H7 after which black will be under a lot of pressure obviously Todd has his reasons not to play this move probably thought it was a bit of an overcommitment he probably didn't like that the pawn could become weak so he brought his King and he brought his King and he brought his Rook to seize control of the only open file only open file and then he tried to trade the knights and his idea with trading the knights was very simple he didn't care if he got taken or not he just wanted to put his King in the center of the board and now he's got a very very pleasant Edge he's not up any pawns but he feels that way cuz he's about to take one right now F5 was a major commitment instead F6 is preferred by the modern day a computer to try to basically absorb this very depressing position and say I'm not going to lose but F5 right T had this way of making even the best and most reserved players in the world panic and when this started happening rather than buckling down and playing a pawn down endgame pjan lashed out F5 was already a step in the wrong direction he should have wenton F6 what was even worse than F5 was advancing with F4 he pushed that four he opened up the diagonal which now allows the pawn to go to H7 in the future and that is exactly what tall went for he trades there is a golden rule in end games if you want to win an end game and there are four Rooks on the board two and two not four for you if you're up four Rooks God Bless but if it's two and two trade one if you're trying to win trade one sometimes trading two is also fine and what I mean by that is like in an end game like this one you can trade all the Rooks because your outside pass Pawn is so strong but not always but now H6 and now the king takes the pawn the bishop goes to G6 and the way the tal sets up a winning configuration here is incredible watch this King D4 where's the Breakthrough puts all his pawns on dark squares look at look at this Quest that he fulfills it's because the black Bishop can't touch those pawns and now look at that you can't take the bishop CU like Queen can't take the pawn cuz I take your Pawn he anchors the bishop here life lifelong pressure will exist he defends the pawn and now it's just masterful he gets there and he ends this game in style of tall take take the Pawn's promoting but tal can't resist he just he can't resist playing like this it's a race D5 trying to break the bishop out of purgatory both sides are going to make Queens but it doesn't matter Talis up a bishop and four pawns that's mate and that's going to be mate very soon discovered attack and there's nothing to be done Queen C1 you can give me a million checks my king goes all the way down the board there's a way to get stalemated but in this position uh tigran petan resigns and uh what a win and and you know it's fascinating to just see a player like tal take down a player like petan in a in a in this battle of styles in this Clash of like offense defense Dynamics versus stability um and pragmatism and and and just the smallest of imbalances utilized he brought his King up this Pawn was the difference maker uh and uh just a very nice win now uh T could also get it done in different ways like pet uh petan's an incredible player brunin brunin is uh maybe the best chess player to never be world champion that's you know that's a video in and of itself and maybe it exists already because you're watching this in 2026 or whatever um look at this game so this game began as a SLO defense ironic because you know the players uh but uh G6 is not a move that white has played so it's not symmetrical and now rather than keeping it symmetrical like this seeing that your opponent is committing to this move tall takes so he creates a stability and basically says look your Bishop is just useless I mean it's just slightly worse for me right I develop we both Castle you want my Bishop come and get it you now need to take it like this which would then isolate your knight on the edge of the board so brunin says no no no no Misha I I want to take the bishop but I want to do it this way now the bishop tucks away on F7 like this and now tal is just going to basically put pressure on the side of the board except he's not going to do that at all and he attacks the center he targets the center okay that I mean I would have thought he was going to you know operate on that side of the board but no he targets the center and uh he's going to try to attack with E4 E5 uh and you know etc etc so these Bishops are passive so let let's see what's going to happen Rook B8 and brunin starts playing like B5 and plays B4 but what are you going to do with the Knight on C4 nothing he's just going to take on A7 he's like look if David is going to give me the pawn terrific Bishop E8 and now seeing as though the queen is about to get trapped basically you can go to C5 but then I will play Rook like again G4 Rook F7 Queen C5 there's Rook C7 and there's f8 so the queen is just trapped so now tal says I'm going to take your knight so Bishop E8 I'm going to get rid of your knight and we're going to play Knights versus Bishops Rook F7 I can get my queen out now this is the position let's take take and now white is going to try to play this position for a victory right white is going to advance because he has two pass pawns so Queen B2 Brun stain plays G5 he has to play G5 he has to play G5 because he gives he has to give white something to think about if you know if if you just play King h8 King G8 white goes here you play King G8 white plays B5 like and this is White's game plan so you have to give white something to think about so now T puts the queen on D2 what what's the I don't what's the point well if G4 now there's no Bishop H6 and everything is protected and I'm going to put my Rooks behind my pawns I'm just going to go so he offers up the pawn queen D2 he offers up the pawn for capture Knight takes D5 hits The Rook The Rook moves back the Knight reroutes and to is just going for the endgame he's going to try to swarm that pawn now the D Pawn blocks the Bishop from seeing his Pawn the a pawn stopped the Bishop from going there so to dominate Bishops on an open board you basically just have to cut off their targets you have to make them useless it's very difficult skill to do now these pawns fall off the board and we trade all the Rooks and tal is like I'm up a pawn and it's a very useful Pawn now watch as he dominates he puts the knights on all the light squares he starts controlling all the light squares he's going to go back into the black position look at this and because all the pawns are overextended from the earlier phase of the game the black king is quite weak he doesn't care about the F2 Pawn you know why he doesn't care about the F2 Pawn because the black king is stuck stuck in the bunker with those Bishops and this Pawn is going to mobilize now if you play something like Queen D2 here I'll take your bishop and I'm going to go for your king and there's nothing you can do look at this absolute domination knights's pawn queen like a little diamond in the center of the board glistening the threat of this the threat of removing the bishop if you move your Bishop like I don't know let's say to A3 it's mate it's mate King h8 Knight F7 my mouse is doing some weird stuff King G8 okay I guess my mouse is just broken that's cool know I don't know what's happening uh uh my mouse is oh my goodness it's like just refusing to move what the heck is going on hate when this happens might have to order a new mouse after this video Queen G6 Checkmate that is what would happen instead we have H4 it doesn't really matter he takes on f8 King G3 the king is safe Queen E7 and in this position brunin resigned because King G8 queen d8 king H7 que F6 this is mate this is F7 so it's just over he gets it done versus all these players in such amazing ways uh and the last game I got to show you this is um against a strong chess master from from the Soviet Union Constantine uh claman claman uh and uh this is just vintage tall so if you're 20 minutes into this thing we will end on a on a good note we will end on exactly the way that uh that mishal plays chess which is um like this playing the Sicilian Defense against t is just you know you're you're asking for it Knight F3 Knight C6 speaking of which remember ganza uh this player who invented openings he has a variation In This Very opening in the uh in the Rosal Lio castles Bishop G7 Rook to E1 and there's a line here E5 there actually a very strong move here Pawn to B4 it's a very odd Gambit but it's actually been played at top level and the idea is to deflect some pieces off the Center and then white tries to get some initiative with A3 so guran invented this as well so he invented two openings a guy featured in this video straight up invented two openings just being a Soviet Master is incredible you can leave such an impression on the game um in this game though t play D4 take take and we have a Rouser variation of the Spanish where tall I mean this is just like you know it was automatic I mean he was pre-moving he was going to take the Knight damage the structure long castle and say like let's go let's have some fun so uh Clon played Rook C8 obviously you know trying to fight on the open C file and many people here would play King B1 because it's slightly scary no no T was just like let's go F4 uh I'd like to attack you first I traded my dark squir Bishop so I want to build up on the dark squares right clamon now lost the right to Castle he brought his Rooks to the game instead but you know you could argue that the king's quite strong here like this is a very solid setup the only way to break it down is is going to be to try to take some risk and open up the position and maybe white is actually weaker than black black plays E6 immediately taking advantage of that diagonal T plays Bishop H3 now Black's best move was probably F5 to try to open up the diagonal like this but again you're playing tall So you you're a little bit scared of opening up the center so he does this bishop H3 T say queen trade what do you nuts how else am I going to get into a YouTube video 67 years in the future and Black Blade B5 and I mean black black is doing what black is supposed to do in this position it's very complicated but when you when you give T stuff like this this is like this is like feeding a caffeine addict or really good cappuccino all right or Americano or flat white or cortado or whatever it is that you drink makiato Rook E1 so finally he plays his King to B1 his Queen side is stabilized and he's ready with Knight D4 and there it is and I mean in this position claman must have just like wanted to experience skydiving in chess form you know like some people are Adrenaline Junkies they they want to skydive they want to do certain things they want to swim with sharks they they want to experience cool things in life taking honey from a beehive or from a bear is is is fits into that description like he could have played A5 and just kept going with his pawns and maybe played Bishop E7 and slowly built up the attack no he's like Queen four we4 let's see what happens taking a pawn with a queen and a king directly in the line of sight of T's position F5 here is very strong obviously if takes you just lose you lose your queen uh but if black plays E5 then you know light scores are weak I can play Knight F4 Knight D5 maybe Knight F4 Knight E6 maybe Knight F4 Knight H5 but instead of that he plays Knight D4 first queen goes back to B7 just plays Queen D3 and he's like hey uh qua how are you going to defend your H7 Pawn one of the possible moves in this position by the way is to play Rook h8 but that's extremely depressing the other one is to play King d8 and try to walk the king to safety which is hilarious he goes here though I was like okay I'm going to take my Pawn back thank you very much and now Bishop G4 and he has this and this in mind as well as F5 as well as an H Pawn like he had against uh petan King A1 so the king is completely tucked away in the corner of the board and now CA plays F5 his idea is to bring the bishop to the game but yeah tal is a nasty counter puncher and uh he does not play Bishop H5 he just takes the damn pawn and I think at this point costu might have realized uhoh uhoh I stole the Bears honey and I probably shouldn't have done that he takes on F5 losing a bishop sacri ACF iing a bishop is not enough for mik T who in this position has to add to that by sacrificing The Rook Rook takes E7 so now he's down four points of material which is effectively a rook he's down a rook because he got a bishop back but he lost you know he lost that material earlier but how do you guard your king and usually you know this type of stuff ends in like check check check check mate Place check only move Queen H6 how do you guard your Rook how do you guard F6 and how how do you guard the back rank all at the same time you can play Rook F7 but then you lose to the back rank can move your Rook then you lose F6 so what do you do nothing that combination Uncorked by tal strips the black king of his defenses and he's going to win his Rook back and he's going to get some interest now he's up two pawns and this is just vintage tal Don't Take The Rook by the way because that hangs back rank mate instead he just plays Rook C1 and I got news for you he's going to open up the C file as well so Bishop A4 Queen D4 now he's going for the end game Queen C4 check and in this position black resigned because it's a fork on E6 and if you play King D7 you actually make it even worse for yourself he could have defended a little bit better he could have maybe played something like Rook d8 but it's completely lost it's lost because even the end game is losing after Queen G7 but Knight C5 is a fork you cannot take it's also a fork of this Knight you know it's it's a completely lost position uh and uh yeah tall one uh the tournament with 14 points out of 21 games at the age of 20 I believe the youngest winner at the time uh and maybe ever by the way and for his performance they granted him the grandmas title so he straight up played a tournament and he got The Grandmaster title for it that had never happened up until that point I mean The Grandmaster title was only 7 years old but he got it in 19 57 and obviously a couple of years later he went on to become the world champion he went on to win the World Championship uh at the uh age of um 22 23 yeah you talk about a successful career especially early on I mean just an absolute genius uh with so many games defeating so many legends that had you know been older than him more experienced than him and running through them and back in the day they played tournaments that were 20 games long so a chess tournament was an entire month wild stuff let me know if you want me to take more historical deep Dives particularly into 20th century or 19th century chess I always love looking at games of tal I always love looking at um the story lines and some of the legendary games that he had I'll see you in the next video get out of here
