so we're in the badger operations center at emf 2018 and today we're handing out the tilde mark delta badges this year's badge is a gsm phone we've built an entire phone on our badge this year we've deployed a our own gsm network across the site um so you've got a badge running micro python with wi-fi gsm phone and bluetooth headset compatibility so you can use connect inclusive headsets to it and make phone calls between badges we think this is the first conference badge gsm phone that's been deployed we've spent the last six months two years building this thing it's been very late and a lot of it's been done in here at the festival finishing off soldering antennas flashing firmwares writing code up until the last minute and we're finally handing out to attendees today and we're hoping everyone can sit and write apps it's a evolution of the badge from two years ago till the mark pi which when i had the microphone on the wi-fi so we've added the gsm on top you take a cpu you take a wi-fi chip and you take a phone module and you think oh yeah we'll just put this on the board and then you start adding buttons and screens and sensors and um the the main processor on this badge has 128 pins we've used all of them plus a 16-pin port expander to interconnect everything and get them all talking together um and there's been [Music] a lot of guys working on code we've we've done a fresh port of micropython to ti's latest msp432e mcu um and ti are releasing that and our version of on top of that with the tilde board it should be released and hopefully somebody will get pushed back to microfighter's main repository and yes making the first phone call a couple of months ago to jonty was like hello i'm calling you from a badge and we finally had the first badge to badge phone call yesterday morning is that possible i don't know i'm not sure because i haven't played a lot with the software as the pcb designer you you've got a full menu so you can find the phone number i believe nice how would they work when you get designated yes it's also tight it's tied into our um deck our onsite deck network so the badges are getting a four or five digit id which can be full call from the dex network and it should be able to find it in the phone app and make phone calls and i believe we can also do outside calls and they should uh incoming i'm not sure about um we've got any ones that are working covering up most of the stuff in the center is the ti's uh msp43432e processor um to the right of that we have eight megabytes of ram external so that we've got a lot of extra ram to allow the micro python apps and the app developers because you can write your own apps i've got a lot of memory to play around with this year just to the left here we have a one megabyte serial flash chip that's where all the apps are getting stored and saved in the bottom right hand corner is this is the all the wi-fi areas there cc3120 which is their latest release of their wi-fi chip um that's laid out and over the left-hand side here we have the sim 800c gsm module the sim card the gsm antenna which was hand soldered we have the speaker and we have the microphone and this is the bluetooth headset antenna the microphones have a hardware disconnect so you can turn your microphone off so you make sure no one's hacking your badge and and listening in the there's the processor and the sim module of both hooked up to the speaker microphone so we're hoping someone's gonna be able to do from the cpu dial up modem over over the in in band over the analog with pwm signals and then do telex maybe um we have thanks to seed studio who sponsored the pcbs we have some grove connectors which connect to c studios grow sensor modules they do a hundred different breakouts of stuff that can plug in around the bottom we have some pins broken out with serial ports and i2c and some pins that these are for doing conductive threads and wearable stuff so sewing leds down your lanyard and conductive threads down the lanyard and again we've got the same pins broken out on headers over here and then we have usb to plug in for a python console and a mass storage access to the math storage device um and on the front buttons lots and lots of buttons so we have a t9 cube pad laid out joystick menu call n buttons and then we have two neopixel leds so we've got quite bright torch mode lots of colors the previous badge had the same top curve but was straight across the bottom and the screen was in in landscape and we had the menu the a b and the joystick buttons so yes we've grown the board and we've still got a processor and a wi-fi and we've bolted on the gsm the processor itself has changed we had an sdm32 two years ago the wi-fi chip is the it's the next generation we had the cc 3100 last year this time we've got the 3120 we've doubled the battery size um to allow to hopefully allow us to um cover the extra power draw from the from the gsm modem and the wi-fi run at the same time um there's a bunch of sensors thrown on there for fun uh we've got temperature and humidity temperature tucked under there a hall effect and there's a lux sensor on the front for light levels when we're developing the badge we keep everything under wraps up until the last minute so i think the the announcement that we've built the phone went out like on a blog post last week um a week before the event so that people could start writing apps and coming up with apps ideas um and all the sensors were announced at the same time but it's still surprising that there is a there's an info booklet comes with the badge um which has got some snippets of python code to go and test and and play around with sensors and get you started um and there's um some small soldering projects there's a you can solder an led and resistor and so we're doing some soldering workshops here in the tent this is one of the production panels and we've had to visually inspect all of these we've sat and looked at every component there's about 216 components on the back per badge there's about 25 on the front and we've had to look over them and find components that have not been placed properly or gone through the oven misaligned or missing components and because we're such a tight deadline our assembly sponsor hcd were unable they didn't have the time to do the inspection automatically so we've done it here on site so there's two of us we've looked at every board 300 panels about 2100 individual badges out of two and a half thousand that we're aiming for so a lot which is where there's boxes here of boards with pink dots where we've got a fault on there 90 of them can probably be fixed some of them missing components it depends how hard it is to solder it on some of them will be really tiny things we can fix them if we run low on the hand and out we can start running through and fixing these and some of them will just leave and we'll fix after the event um and some of them if they're really bad they'll just go in the bin um but yes we visually inspect them all we've then um soldered the gsm antenna on we've then been flashing the firmware on the gsm module to enable the bluetooth headsets because the default firmware doesn't enable the bluetooth headset ability so that's took it takes around a minute per badge so two and a half thousand minutes it's like 200 hours it's like five days so we've had five laptops going at it for a day and a half and got through all of those fantastically once we flashed the gsm firmware we then have to flash our firmware onto the msp432e the micropython port and then it's kitted up into a bag for a badge pcb we have a battery a badge guide [Applause] screen [Applause] a velcro dot to stick your battery on a lanyard and a hologram sim card and the attendees get to put it together themselves which saves us a lot of effort a lot of time that we haven't and it's a lot of fun for people to put them together and and then go play the past three badges 2014 was tilde mark e which was two point something something something which is the speed of light constant 2016 badge is tilde mark high because it was our third badge so that's three point one four one five nine so under the screen on tilde mark pi it's prior to a thousand decimal places that's the version it's the version number of the badge this year we use irrational mathematical constants um and this year it's a tilde mark delta and the constant is four point six point so and so and again i've got a thousand decimal places uh and this year it's um bound delta constant which is related to bifurcation population studies and chaos theory stuff and i can't remember the rest of it but find some math guys they'll they can soon fill you in on that one yes lots of numbers left on the screen these boxes make up the 128 pins of the processor and all the interconnects so these are all all these connections go to elsewhere i suppose i cheated i'll use my software skills for to do that i actually wrote a program that converts midi files
