I'm gonna get canceled right now for this take but I'm gonna be real here I'm gonna be super super real uh I'm sort of fine with ageism in software engineering I know what completely fine with it here's the deal but it's kind of reverse ageism if you will uh I really really like working with people older than me got em okay opens and all that they make really great decisions okay that's typically been my experience not all the time though sometimes it sucks but I find more often than not it's pretty dang good and so I love experience now that's the thing is it's it's really experience speaking but it's not just experience it's more than experience because there's people that are very very intelligent 17 software is 17 year old software engineer uh is both wise and intelligent because he's wise enough to understand that he should be applying his unlimited amount of free time to learning something that's actually valuable to learn and B he's intelligent enough to be able to do this okay this is great this is very very nice but still 17 to 26 is like the stupidest years of your life okay you're chocked full of hormones and your frontal cortex hasn't even fully formed yet okay it's not my fault it's just that you can't make good decisions okay it's not it's like I'm sorry welcome to your body you make the worst decisions between those times hey take that back I'm just not my I thought your brain ain't formed okay that's your fault that's your fault uh for okay here we go anyways getting canceled any percent Speed Run challenging ageism as a 17 year old software engineer I'm sure it's actually really hard uh as 17 year old uh to be able to try to get respected I'm sure there's a lot of difficulty with that I don't think it's I again I'm not sure how bad that is I think that it's uh I think there's something to that that we should be careful about you know there's kind of like an obsession with youth in our culture at least in you know United States culture and so is it always good to be focused on youth there's things that are really good about people who've seen the world a little bit all right for example I really love golang these days and I want to work with it hey I like golang too let's go uh when I try to nominate myself for a position in nine out of 10 cases on average I get rejections and you know what they don't even uh want to listen just because of my age it's ninety percent damn and for this reason age how do you know this sorry this article started right out this article just started right in the middle of a sentence and I don't I'm like I'm just trying to like get into it you know what I mean all right hey there fellow Tech enthusiasts my name is Kenji and I'm on a mission to show the world that age is just a number in the realm of software engineering I actually disagree with this age is not just a number uh I do think experience is very very important but not just experience uh living long enough to live through a few hype Cycles is really really important I think that the hype Cycles are really big and important thing to live through like like I think that what you needed to do uh why I think a lot of these older Engineers are so uh can be really awesome is that they they had to implement soap and soap was the future and none of us Implement soap you know why because they all implemented soap they saw the disaster and then they avoided us going off that Cliff you know what I mean there's like there's there's something there there's something very valuable valuable about that we're not using XML I mean okay those who use Visual Studio still use XML loser but the rest of us don't use XML okay we use Tamil okay tamil's great XML is for stupid people Thomas fantastic uh hailing from Ukraine I've embarked on a path that's not only about coding but also about breaking stereotypes and proving that passion and skill uh no uh no no age boundaries uh in some sense it does know I mean again again to become great at something you know the whole 10 000 hours thing it does take just time right just pure time uh if you're wondering about my knowledge and Tech stack well you have a golang rust node.js JavaScript typescript Elixir python but that's not where it ends I've also dabbled in C C plus plus Lua classic neovim user right here classic you can see the neovim user just forming as we speak in others uh just to keep things interesting my days are filled with lines of code debugging sessions and exhilarating satisfaction of solving problems and of course learning and exploring more and more my love for programming runs deep and it's not just about code itself it's about crafting Solutions and seeing possibilities where others might see roadblocks and of course there's my beautiful new event let's go you feel it you could just feel classic deal of abuser you could just feel it right I could just I could just taste it I knew it on my rice Linux a testament to my dedication to creating a workspace that's both functional and inspiring age is just a number right but does it use Arch that's a great question you know I don't I I don't know I I will say there is something like one of my favorite I still recall my favorite project I ever worked with anybody ever on in the entirety of my career was with a uh intern he must have been 17 18 years old Nathan he looked 14. I don't know anyways he was very young dude I would just like set some bounds and he would run clobber through all the bounds and just make stuff and some of it was just horrible some of it was amazing and he just loved building stuff and it was one of the funnest times I've ever had we deleted a lot of code we made a lot of mistakes we went the wrong direction a couple times but nonetheless that was like my favorite favorite time just because it's so much fun working with people who equally want to do something great you know what I mean so I mean there is something very very there is something in here that you know what doesn't I mean what it actually does know uh something that does know age boundaries is typically like excitement or passion right your passion wanes as you get older because you've just seen enough of it that you probably don't need to keep seeing the same thing over and over again I get that right like there's gonna come a point where I'll be bored of programming I won't want to do it anymore it's just part of life like it's just something that happens to all people and I don't think it's bad because we're not we're not destined to be Eternal here right that's why everything that glows bright starts to lose its glow over time now let's tackle the elephant in the room using Arch Linux ageism I really want to hear more about this neovim setup uh judging me of him set up in five four three two one uh it's quite amusing really while I'm busy juggling multiple languages Frameworks and projects some folks still find themselves hung up on my age yes I'm just 17 years old and no that's not a typo but here's the kicker my age has no correlation with my skills or passion it has to have some correlation because you spent the last year doing things the last two years or the last three years so the last four years right like you have to like I don't feel like he's seeing the fact that he's saying all these languages you can't learn all of those in a day right if you could learn everything in a day I would agree age has no relation to skills right I would completely agree on you but uh but like to be good at rust is kind of a multi-year thing I'm okay at rust I'd put myself in the okay I can use arc Arc mutexes you know I'm I'm dude I literally spam mutacies okay I'm just like a zerg a Zerg player of just mutacies gallons of them flying everywhere like I know how I can kind of rust you know what I mean it's funny how some people assume that youth automatically equals inexperience illiteracy I don't know about that last one uh amount of knowledge Etc uh I've encountered my fair share of raised eyebrows and skeptical glances as if uh the number of years I've been alive has some magical ability to determine my capability it's a function it it is it's a function of time I mean I agree I agree in the sense that if you spent all of your time since 12 years old absolutely crushing Ash in the software development World by the time you're 17 you're a pretty badass developer and you will totally be judged by age despite the fact um despite the fact that you probably don't deserve nearly the Judgment as you do but you're still 17. it's very like it's when I was 17 when I was 20 when I was 22 it was impossible to tell me about how life was going to be when I was in my 30s right you couldn't tell me because I couldn't hear I didn't have ears to hear because I just simply haven't achieved that level of understanding or being able to look back on life uh it's it's very hard to explain and so like there's more than just simply time in the saddle programming there's also just life lived uh you know there's something about I'm gonna so this part's death okay so my earlier take probably won't get me canceled but this one probably will there's something about having to wake up at one in the morning and change poopy diapers and and having a kid decide that they're not going to go to bed until 1am 2 A.M 3 A.M that happens multiple nights in a row and then you have to go into work and perform well and you have to do all this crap there's something about that that will cool how you look at people in a different way right and I don't mean that in you know like I do mean that actually in the most obvious way uh it's just that living life in a way that you can't live for yourself makes you change how you live you know in general and so when you're 17 you pretty much exclusively live for yourself so I think that it's very easy especially at that younger age to look at people and to make snap judgments a lot easier uh just because you haven't you know you haven't experienced maybe a larger set of stuff and so I think he's absolutely right that no matter how talented he is he will always be judged for being 17 and I feel bad for that absolutely we can all feel bad for that even if he is fantastic and he's Super Wise and all those things and is really good developer but at the end of the day uh you know we do that because it's for the most part you wouldn't be wrong right I'm just gonna say you're not going to be wrong and I totally understand why people make that judgment feels bad for him though keep on pushing I hope he keeps on growing and I I hope you take a you definitely because there's a lot of there's a lot of stuffs in here that makes me feel like maybe you got some time to think about how you bring up people uh you know and maybe it feels like you might be a bit on your snap judgments here uh so here's the uh here's to the fellow techies who are navigating ageism while juggling complex code bases remember your passion your skills and your dedication are the true markers of success this is true as time goes on if you can maintain these things you will just buy the sheer Dent of doing that you will you will start gaining ground and you'll start actually making great contributions and eventually you'll have great things you know my mom always says the harder I work the luckier I get you know why and I think she's right you know my mom lived through oh she had a horrible life in some sense in her 30s my dad died when I was uh when I was young she had the take on the responsibility of raising three kids while declaring bankruptcy uh my brother became a meth head um I kind of got lost there for a little bit um my sister ended up having uh you know some some problems medically right a lot a lot a lot of things all came up and my mom just kept telling me the harder I work the luckier I get and she she did a great job my mom is a dang Saint and I genuinely love her very very much for shaping who I am yeah love her very much and so I agree with this you know if you can remember these things and you can hold on to them long enough things do change may not change the moment but they do change let's continue to prove that age is about a footnote in our journey towards Innovation and excellence and to this uh who can still wrap their heads around the idea of a 17 year old back-end developer well I'll be here coding away leaving ageism in the digital dust thanks for reading the article thanks Kenji I appreciate that uh you know I think it's a good uh I think you're you're doing a great job focusing on on some good things uh if I could give any advice it is to uh it is to recognize that people are going to have different opinions about things and that your struggle is a struggle that's probably gonna help shape you and make you into something great and so looking at it as if it's like there's these people that are ignorant versus people that understand maybe not the right way you know just throwing that out there just throwing something out there okay hey the name is the prime machine
