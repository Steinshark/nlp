a few days ago I tweeted I will do as many push ups and pull ups next 30 days as this tweet gets likes retweets and comments no number is too high bring it it got 20,000 so thank you internet friends for the love and the suffering it was probably about four or more times the amount that I was mentally preparing myself for in the name of health I decided to spread that around across multiple body weight exercises including push-ups and pull-ups but also squats rollers and running one mile of running equals 42 push-ups Lex math and I'm happy with myself I wrote to David Goggins asking for his advice thoughts on this challenge if you don't know David Goggins he to me is one of the toughest most inspiring humans in the planet retired Navy SEAL ultra marathon runner former record holder for the most pull-ups and 24 hours author of the book can't hurt me that highly recommend especially the audiobook anyway I asked him a few questions about this challenge and he was kind enough to respond i'll linter leave the clips into the video so the first thing I did is I explained to him the challenge and the way I spread it around across multiple bodyweight exercises and just asked him for his thoughts about what I'm doing well it's a pretty good damn workout this the issue right there man I believe the ITO people aren't I think it was Twitter I'm not quite for sure I think was Twitter that you would do push-ups and pull-ups for the number of week retweets that you had now I'm hearing running I'm hearing squats I'm hearing I am here push-ups and pull-ups I'm hearing all kind of different other exercises and you also told people that guess what bring it no numbers to I but now are your other exercises that must mean that there is a number too high so be careful what you wish for my friend so that being said I would have stuck with the damn push-ups and pull-ups and challenged yourself to the up teeth degree of pain and suffering and that would have really taught you a humongous lesson about yourself and and everything else but what you have here is also amazing but it's nothing compared to uh what she had you know previously talked about well there you have it when David Goggins calls you out in your bullshit you got to step up so I'm gonna do what I originally promised which is the 20,000 push-ups and pull-ups and on top of that I'll do my best to do also the other bodyweight exercises really for the sake of health so we're talking about squats ab rollers and running the whole goal I wanted to do here is something that's healthy but still pushes me to my limits physically mentally and allows me to build up a habit of doing some efficient exercise every day you know something that takes less than an hour but keeps me in pretty sharp hard shape that's why I do here certainly with 20,000 push-ups and pull-ups that's a whole nother level I don't know what's gonna happen but I will learn something about myself for sure so I want to mention some of the reasons some of the motivations of why I'm doing this challenge so first is I didn't think too much about I just dive right in it was actually just laying in bed and tweeted it out I think some of the craziest most fun some of the most ambitious things we can take on in life sometimes can be just on a whim so I'm decided on the whim we're gonna take it to completion I also wanted to do an exercise program that I've done often in the past that takes very little effort so like being busy is not an excuse it can take 20-30 minutes a day just to get a hard workout in you can do it at home there's no excuse not to do it the other thing is that travel is not an excuse because it's body weight you could basically do it anywhere you probably heard me talk a lot about it before but I'm a huge believer in habits coz habits remove the need for day to day motivations that can go up and down I have a lot of research work related to have us that a part of my life but I wanted to get exercise as part of a daily routine in my life I think especially in these times of the coronavirus and all the madness that's going on in the world being healthy making sure you're strengthening your immune system with good diet good sleep good exercise it's really important for everybody everybody's kind of locked up and it's easy to slack on the exercise and I I wanted to motivate others perhaps to join me on getting their exercise back on getting back out there getting a little bit of movement every single day and also I wanted to harden up that muscle of doing the thing you don't want to do for that long period of time and getting it done so I actually asked David what should I do when things get tough haha it's a good fucking question make it is going to get fucking difficult day after day after day that's the thing about what you're doing right now that's that's challenging is a lot of the motherfuckers can sign up for the fucking one-day event why don't we do a lot of these CEOs a lot of these people don't want to suffer you know as a living who don't want to suffer as making it a habit what they do is they go out and they recruit these people to put them through a 2 day 3 day fucking challenge anybody can do that shit because your mind can process two or three fucking days of Sun what you're doing my friend is going to be damn near a month of suck so basically you're gonna have a lot of days especially in the morning time the mornings when you wake up and your body says go fuck yourself because I don't fucking feel like doing this today and you're gonna look at cuz you're running 6 miles a day I believe you know what's going to happen to your fucking ass you're gonna wake up in the morning and you're gonna fucking do what I do people think I love David Geiger's just wakes the fuck up and he just gets just shit on he gets this book after I know I don't get up and get after it I look at my shoes sometimes for hours I passed them I go I get stuff to drink I go to the bathroom I watch TV I started doing some work and I look at those fucking shoes because why my body saying go fuck yourself so you have to be able to win the morning you have to be able to not allow that to get too deep in your brain and when things get really tough for you when you're out there on like day 17 and your knees are hurting and your back is hurt and your shoulders are hurting you l will get elbow tendonitis and all kind of shit going on you got to start remembering your resume a lot of people don't remember what the fuck they've accomplished in life and at that time of suffering you have to be able to fucking go through and pull up that fucking who the fuck I am resume and say oh for you you I'm sure you studied your fucking ass off for hours and days and years to get where you're at I guarantee you did shit harder than this and that's basically what you have to go back to but it's hard to do because in that moment of suffering all you can fucking think about is getting the fuck out of it so you got take that one second to pull yourself out of that suffering to have a clear fucking thought it's hard to have clear thoughts in the midst of extreme pain and suffering find that clear thought remind yourself of what you've been through back in the past back in the day to get to where you're at today so that's what I do is a constant reminder and then through that process I guarantee you your mind and body muster up we got this we've we've been here before maybe not that kind of pain and suffering but we've been here before in the demons of your own mind so that's the best reminder in the world all right so what I'm going to attempt I'm going to do as 20,000 push-ups and pull-ups combined and on top of that I'm also going to do squats ab rollers and run six miles everyday so the routine is this run six miles and then do 34 rounds of the following 15 push-ups 5 pull-ups 5 ab rollers and 10 squats just over and over 34 times a day I might split it up 3 times a day I might do it twice a day I might do it just one a day my plan is to do the hardest one early on in the day try to get as much done as possible most likely about 14 rounds and then do another 10 and 10 later on in the day the goal is for each round like that to take about two minutes so for 34 rounds that's 68 minutes so the start is tomorrow Wednesday June 10th going on for 30 days after that so let me quickly do around to give you a sense of the form and then talk about it you so there you have it that's one round the hope for that is to take about a minute and the total is two minutes to get a break of about a minute between each each session obviously good form is important there's always going to be a keyboard warrior out there I'm looking at you with some sweat bands in their mom's basement with Cheetos all over the place we had a shape who's gonna comment about the fact that the push-ups aren't all the way down or aren't all the way up and the same with the pull ups so on and so forth none of that matters good form in this case for a push up and a pull up it's something that minimizes the risk of injury I think this whole thing is a tough workout to be honest yesterday and the day before I did over 400 which was I was trying to see is this even possible can I do 680 total push up some pull-ups in a day it seems like an insane number to me so so I did 400 and it was tough but doable and I think if 400 is doable than 680 is - I think I can certainly with a little bit of suffering do it for a few days if I can be fortunate enough to avoid injury the rest of the month is just mental that's where the battle is that's where all the good lessons like to be learned so I also asked David by the way there's a laptop over here that's what I'm working over here I also asked David about you know about the fact that some people might join in on this challenge in whatever capacity they can and what he recommends for me and for others to stay injury-free while still pushing their body and their mind to the limit well this challenge you're going to get injured if you don't have a good base like for instance if you don't do a lot of pull-ups a lot of push-ups what you do for both is you're utilizing these elbows which you get tendonitis severely bad and your shoulders so with the push-up you're here this is your hinge part yet you are using your chest using your triceps but this hinge is being used an awful lot this elbow hinge these shoulders are being used offline even pull up motion being used offline so basically what happens is you're going to get injured so for a lot of you I would definitely suggest doing a lot more squats do a lot more apps doing things like that even abs you can eat your ass but going from zero to hero you will have some injuries and you got this Isum try to get your body to recover as fast as possible taking the proteins taking the minnows things like that getting as much rest as you can but you're going to get over overuse start training issues with you know with your body that just comes with it it's just nature of the beast and like I said those do start to get injured start doing those uh start making those squats you know you're your go-to because your legs can handle so much when I was doing the pull-up record people wondered why that was so hard for me first of all I had a jacked up body when I was doing it a very uh I guess out of alignment body but your only contact point is your hands and there's been times in too much of my races where I tore my quad completely tore my quad I was able to bandage it up and walk it out I was able to walk seventy-five miles so this two thing your legs can handle a lot of abuse a lot of abuse so we start hurting go to your legs so there you have it don't use any kind of injuries an excuse to stop to stop moving stop exercising just find an alternative exercise that doesn't hurt you know I'm gonna really try to stick to the push up and pull up and do everything I can to remain injury free for me a part of voiding injury is stretching really well also doing a good warm-up like for me I'm doing the six mile run before doing the body weight exercises also obviously nutrition is important everybody has their own journey I've dieted my whole life all kinds of ways then combat sports my whole life so cutting weight and performing optimally was always important for me whatever you think about it the main diet that I've come to enjoy is either keto or carnivores so primarily a meat-based diet meat and fat very low carb so mostly for me that just means ground beef sometimes steak and keto friendly little carb snacks and their nutrition wise it's pretty basic but I did do take some stuff so I take sodium in my food so I put quite a bit of salt in there magnesium also take fish oil and pill form not much like two or three fish oil pills a day and in a multivitamin that's it it would be of course awesome if other folks if you decided to join in on this challenge in whatever level you want it just be fun to do push ups and pulls together or any kind of difficult exercise activity that will challenge you do it every single day if you haven't ramped up to it you haven't done it much what I recommend is to start very low - we're almost you're comfortable and then increase your day-by-day - when you quickly become uncomfortable but give your body time to adjust that's like really important again the point here is to do a difficult exercise but really is to do it for thirty days and what I'm doing and I hope you do as well it's not just for 30 days it's for 30 days you do something difficult but you form that habit and you stick to it for months to come especially in these times exercise is just so important for staying healthy and staying sane so I'd love it if you joined in on the challenge of a spreadsheet linked in the description well I'll keep track of the reps that I'm doing on a daily basis just so you can follow along you can also just copy that spreadsheet and use it for yourself to track your own numbers share with me on any of the social platforms I'd love to see your progress I'll also maybe go live on one of the Platt forms Instagram YouTube on our discord server Twitter I don't know I don't know if there's interesting that I'll be honest I tried Instagram live a couple of days ago to work out and it was a little weird for me to work out other people watched I'm not sure but maybe if there's interests let me know maybe I can take a few questions about the challenge I'll probably record video throughout the month and just publish it at the end so with that I'd like to thank David Goggins I follow him on Instagram and he's a constant reminder that I need to push myself to my limit mentally I asked them of course whether he want to be a guest in the podcast let's see what he had to say no problem man I love what you do I've seen some of your work you're extremely intelligent guy so your intelligence and I see that you're willing to go the next mile so you you're willing to be a guy that is just not alright so for instance I was in the military they say you better be real smart or you better fucking be real hard and so I was the real hard guy and I had to develop the smarts I see that you're a really smart guy and you're developing the heart so I think that uh we can really have a good podcast together be it'd be pretty you know interesting conversation so there you have it it's on I think I'm recording this video but most of this journey is quiet it's on my onus with myself it's a quiet journey of suffering so yes it's the way to get exercise back in my life but it's really a chance to rediscover myself by doing something really really difficult for a prolonged period of time no matter what I'll be a different and I think a better human being on the other end if you join me on this in your own parallel journey great either way stay healthy and stay hard you
