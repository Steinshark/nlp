monitor manufacturers have been lying to us about something really important you know when you look at a spec sheet you'll see a field that says response time yeah that number is a lie probably to put it simply response times tell you how quickly the pixels on your screen can transition from showing you one color value to another and it matters because if your response time is too slow moving images on your screen could look blurry not exactly what you want after dropping all that money on a new display so let's say you found a monitor with a nice low response time maybe as low as a single millisecond listed on the box it sounds good at first but how exactly did this display manufacturer arrive at that number well they tested it but not in a way that reflects how anyone is realistically using a monitor or even in a way that reflects how the monitor next to it on the Shelf was tested by its manufacturer what kinds of things could be wrong with their tests well for starters they're often conducted in hot rooms which decreases the viscosity of the liquid crystals inside the display allowing them to respond more quickly and when we say hot we mean significantly above normal room temperature in fact the video electronic standards Association or VISA calls the temperature at which many of these tests are carried out as abnormally high and that's not the only way that these results get manipulated lots of monitors have an overdrive setting but that doesn't mean they include an automatic transmission what a monitor overdrive does is artificially force a faster response time by applying a higher voltage to each pixel and while it can be a useful feature it's also quite common for overdrive to produce artifacts like inverse ghosting or Coronas and as you may have guessed monitor companies are also often guilty of applying very aggressive overdrive settings when they do their response times tests so that they can put the lowest number possible on the spec sheet even though those overdrive settings make the pitcher look like hot garbage a lot of the time combine that with the fact that results can be cherry-picked from the very best units instead of reflecting an average and it's not surprised using that fudged response time numbers have been identified as a major issue among display enthusiasts but Visa has a pro consumer plan to end all of these Shenanigans and we're going to tell you what it is right after we thank Oracle for sponsoring this video oracle's Cloud world event is happening from October 17th to the 20th in Las Vegas Nevada and if you're into League of Legends and artificial intelligence you can actually learn Ai and improve your law skills at the same time there's going to be a three-part series involving data extraction and manipulation model building and neural networks look for the first part of this series to drop virtually in late September the second running live at Oracle Cloud World in October and the third following close behind so sign up today at the link below vesa has recently come and saved the day with a new certification called clear Mr which defines a strict set of standards for testing first off tests have to be conducted within a narrow temperature range reflective of typical room temperatures that's between 72 and a half and 76 degrees Fahrenheit or 22 and a half to 24.5 degrees Celsius additionally monitors have to be tested at their native resolution only after a warm-up period and at default settings although critics have pointed out this might unfairly exclude monitor features such as backlight strobing that could mitigate the effects of slow response times basis seems to be mostly concerned about the inherent properties of the display panel itself and less about the features that you add on later and and Visa has also shown willingness to tweak standards over time as they did with display HDR so maybe these critics concerns will be ass waged eventually anyway for the moment though clear Mr sets acceptable limits for overshoot and undershoot as well this is when a pixel misses its color Target because an overdrive setting has forced it to transition abnormally quickly to earn certification Visa says that overshoot can't be more than 20 percent and undershoot can't be more than 10 percent similar to vasa's display HDR program monitors the pass the test will be given an official clear Mr logo along with a number ranging between three thousand and nine thousand these numbers represent approximate ratios of clear pixels to blurry pixels on your screen so a display rated as clearomar 3000 the lowest certification level will have around 3 000 clear pixels for every blurry pixel on the screen since the clear Mr standard is quite new there aren't many displays out there yet sporting the badge but seeing as most major display manufacturers are Vasa members we're hoping to see it become super common similar to the display HDR certification a spec especially on gaming monitors as I know you didn't just spend all that money on your latest GPU just to have your games look like a poop smear did you thanks for watching guys if
