with tick tocks more great advice i hate 401ks this is kris krohn we're gonna be hearing a lot from him today max out your 401k could be the dumbest advice that i've ever heard for anyone that wants to take financial control of their future why but chris it's free money you do max contribution and the company matches you it's awesome like are you kidding me i love when people mimic someone else that they want to seem stupid so they make a baby voice and then they go are you kidding me dude hey just cause you make the baby voice doesn't mean you're right it is great to max out your 401k you idiot i can't believe they just give anyone like this the ability to go tell people how to make money do you guys realize this guy has an sec complaint against him yeah that's a thing he had to pay 000 to settle it oh why was that oh he had a scheme before this so you think all you see is this guy with like 700 000 followers on tick tock you think he's some big genius bro he's going against like all financial advice ever first of all i give you my money and i'm never gonna see it for decades it's called an investment chris you invest in real estate that's what happens in real estate okay i better just move on guys i it's clear we're not gonna get anywhere here like why would i give that to you even if you're matching it it's not real it's fake funny money it's not though everything you've said here is wrong it's not fake funny it's re it's real actual money what dude anyone can get on tick tock i hope i pray that any of my audience nobody listens to tick tock for financial advice come on man listen if you're new here to coffeezilla welcome to the club first of all and then just go ahead take take get your phone out let's do it together why not get your phone out here you go let's open up tick tock okay we got it and then delete it all together now delete it it's not worth your time there you go and i love how they think like the more passionate and outlandish they are the more correct they are no dude you're just uninformed which is kind of hilarious when you see this next part my mentor after seven years and a million dollars to paying him the most powerful thing he ever taught me was chris the most dangerous information is what you don't know okay let's break that down shall we first of all you paid a guy a million dollars for your mentorship uh chris maybe you should pay attention some coffees ella i think you could have done a lot better if you'd invested that into real estate but but the most ironic part of this is that he's saying the most dangerous thing is what you don't know and then he proceeds to rant about a bunch of things he has no clue about do you think this guy understands the stock market when his big advice is 401ks index funds anything in the stock market don't believe in it just believe in uh real estate because real estate never goes down guys you can never fail in real estate real estate's the only way to get rich with real estate you start here and then it'll just slowly slowly go up i mean look i'm not even real estate's fine it's just one of many options but it's hilarious this guy number one thing the number one thing most dangerous thing is what you don't know and then you go and talk about a thing a bunch of things you don't know about now of course let's be honest you know why he's doing this right you know why he's selling you all this information this year next year and the year after i've got a special event i'm doing april 13th it's a two-hour master class i'm going to teach you how to take 50 grand it's just a pitch for your stupid masterclass so yeah i don't even know if he believes in this stuff i mean he just sells it listen if he was so great at it why wouldn't he just do it if he made so much money at it why wouldn't he just again do it and listen before you say stephen wait what are you talking about like of course he'd want to do this with uh get extra money look at this he says he can get annual 25 annual rois uh that's what this says and he gives you a little chart to show you that uh basically the stock market's a scam because it only gets you six percent a year meanwhile oh my gosh you're gonna get 25 percent a year in the stock market okay if that's true kris krohn would never be selling a course if he could get 25 annually in the stock uh in the real estate he'd never sell a course because he'd be making ungodly amounts of money focusing on his real estate empire so the very fact he's selling you some stupid master class should be a dead giveaway now here's another gem from kris krohn uh he says that you can get a bunch of houses for nothing it's the best real estate year we'll see for the next decade and i'm going to show you how to buy 12 homes without any money or credit if you attend my event january 12th 13th and 14th in the evenings 12 homes with no money down have you lost your mind of course it gets worse what's up what about low cost index funds financial influences be like get low cost index funds because they're low cost with little regard to how they perform as a retirement plan but guess what they freaking suck as retirement plans earth to the human wet wipe uh people do pay attention to how they perform that's literally why they people suggest them they've done the math they go hey this is a great option it consistently performs unlike many other investments now this guy behind the scenes of course he wants to sell you on his little uh little insurance scheme so don't pay attention to people like this anytime you hear somebody going oh low cost index funds suck they suck hey 401k suck get ready get your wallet out because they're about to try to charge it up now of course guys no video would be complete without uh giving equal opportunity to the women grifters of tick tock we got to give equal opportunity so ladies and gentlemen without further ado how do you get rich faster real estate or ai this should be good how do you get rich faster through real estate or ai let's see this is artificial intelligence that i use and look at this if you started 2019 until today two years later with only ten thousand dollar in balance you would have made a thousand two hundred percent return and that would have left you with a hundred thirty three thousand dollars in a year guys what do you do you see anything wrong with this two years twelve hundred percent roi are any alarm bells going off for you i swear dude we've gone so off the deep end of what's like even possible you've gotten to this point where people are literally pitching fraud schemes i mean think about this dude somebody's telling you put all your money in some random pop-up fly-by-night company you never heard of for their proprietary ai guys because if i use enough buzzwords maybe you'll believe i'm on the cutting edge of finance it's so goofy man and i can't believe this lady is like pitching this and she's literally getting away with it she's a nobody but of course on tick tock she's a wealth advisor make 274 a day how can you do that so what i did was i learned how to trade the stock market i learned how to trade the forex market i learned how to trade the crypto market i learned how to trade binary options guys she self admits to being a waitress six months ago now there's no problem with that i was a waiter too but you didn't learn stocks forex crypto and binary markets in six months i'm sorry you did it it's so insane to me because people are seeing this and they're really getting tricked misled and it's like guys just look at how crazy these people are they're they're nuts they're they don't know anything so please don't sign up for this stuff guys please you will make me very very sad if you join these people's masterminds um it really is the blind leading the blind the info course business has no regulation anyone can just project themselves as an expert and uh yeah don't listen all right well that's basically it save your stimis put it in a low cost index fund no matter what curtis ray says and uh yeah that's it for now i hope that you had fun watching the this insanity and it enraged you as much as it did me i'll see you guys next time see ya up smell the coffee
