[Music] hello everyone and welcome my goal for this video is to hit 200 miles per hour now here's the deal i'm in the influencing business i know that's a disgusting word i hate it uh but that's what they say and so as an automotive influencer one of the questions i commonly get is you know what's the fastest car you've ever driven and the thing is i've driven a lot of really fast cars i've been very fortunate to drive a lot of really really sweet cars however the fastest i've ever driven was in a hyundai look i can't be going around telling people that the fastest i've ever ever driven was in a hyundai i can barely say the sentence because it's like dang a hyundai with all these opportunities you've gotten so we're here to change that i am sitting inside of a mclaren 720s spider and i am at the sun valley tour de force so here's how this works i've got a mclaren i've got three miles of open road you know what could go wrong you gotta hit 200 miles per hour sounds easy right well it's not so simple and for two reasons so we do have three miles of public road that's going to be shut down for us to use however really it's only you know the first mile is a blind corner all right so you're going through a blind corner for the first mile then you've got one mile of straight that's where you hit the speed trap and then you've got one mile to break so we're really cutting it uh down to two miles to get it all done and that first mile again is a blind corner so when mclaren asked hey jason like what car do you want to do this in i said uh how about the speed tail and they said hey jason uh what car do you want to do this in so i said all right what are my options so they said mclaren 720s they said mclaren 765lt and they said mclaren artura and i thought okay of these like my ultimate goal is to hit 200 miles per hour so which one of these three cars do i think i can do it uh in and as far as top speeds the 720s does have the highest top speed 212 versus the other two are at 205 miles per hour what i was more concerned with is how quickly do i get there because you don't have unlimited space you know and once you start to get to about 150 or so you run out of road really quickly things are moving fast so i want something that can get up to 200 as quickly as possible 765 that's a car with a lot of downforce slightly slower top speed so i thought you know i probably will have better luck uh reaching that top speed in the 720s so that's what i have chosen to go with now this is engineering explained i'm not simply here to brag about this cool experience and what i'm getting to do uh we're gonna do a little math right so that means it's time for a little whiteboard action all right this looks pretty awful yeah yeah so we're not going to spend too much time on this but i want to provide myself with some solid excuses in case things don't go my way because very small changes in atmospheric conditions can create big impacts on whether or not you actually reach 200 miles per hour so we have a mclaren 720s we have 710 horsepower to deal with how much of that horsepower do we actually need in order to hit 200 miles per hour well we can do the math and figure out that that's about 433 kilowatts or about 580 horsepower so that's great right we've got plenty of extra you know 130 extra horsepower in order to actually get this done we're trying to hit 200 miles per hour all right but the location we're doing this at is pretty high up it's got high elevation about 2000 meters or about 6500 feet so what impact does this have well air is less dense at higher elevation so this is actually going to help us with aerodynamic drag so instead of our air density being about 1.225 our density is going to be 1.007 kilograms per meters cubed which means our drag is going to be reduced by about 73 kilowatts or 98 horsepower at 200 miles per hour meaning we only actually need 482 horsepower instead of 580 in order to hit 200 miles per hour because we're at this higher elevation the problem is there's a direct correlation between air density and how much power you can make so if we take a ratio of our air densities we get 82 percent so if we multiply 82 percent by our original power 710 we get 583 horsepower which is just slightly above what we need in order to reach 200 miles per hour now this would be true if this was a naturally aspirated engine however thankfully this 720s has a turbocharged engine so elevation doesn't have quite the same impact so if you're at sea level and this engine wants 30 psi of absolute pressure within that manifold well you've got 15 psi from the atmosphere because you're at sea level and then you add 15 psi with boost with the turbocharger as you go up in elevation say you're at 2000 meters well you've got 12 psi of atmospheric pressure it's lower about 80 percent but you can add more with your turbochargers to still maintain that absolute pressure of 30 psi it's not going to be the same efficiency it's not exactly perfect but you can compensate for that elevation and make more power now what if it's hotter outside well hotter air is less dense so that means we're making less power now this is actually quite complicated it's worthy of its own video but if you look at some of the equations out there and give yourself a nice estimate that means we're going to lose about 23 horsepower if we were to go up just 20 degrees celsius so from 15c to 35c as the day heats up you could lose about 23 horsepower meaning you're now at 687 instead of 710 just from that simple 20 degree difference in air temperature all right so what if we have a little bit of wind and i really mean just a little bit of wind just 10 miles per hour nothing crazy 10 mile per hour tailwind meaning going with the car so our relative airspeed at 200 miles per hour is going to be 190 miles per hour well that means we're going to basically have 59 kilowatts or 79 horsepower less that we don't actually need so we only need 501 horsepower instead of 580 in order to make that 200 mile per hour happen but what if the wind is going against us just 10 miles per hour meaning our relative air speed 210 miles per hour well that means we're going to need an additional 65 kilowatts or 87 horsepower meaning 667 horsepower in order to reach 200 miles per hour and look this is getting extremely close to how much power we have so if we just have a slight headwind it could mean this is impossible all right i feel like i've given myself now sufficient excuses in order to not hit 200 miles per hour let's get to it okay so let me just preface this run by saying i was definitely scared and i didn't expect to actually hit 200 miles per hour i even texted my wife saying exactly that because it turns out driving fast is a bit terrifying and mind you this isn't about the car it's planted at speed and incredibly capable it's about the unknowns what if i get a tire blow out what if an animal pops out of nowhere what if a patch of dirt causes me to slide and truthfully the biggest factor am i confident enough to even push the car to 200 miles per hour will i keep my foot down on the throttle or will i get scared and lift out of fear that was genuinely my largest concern because above 150 miles per hour if you start looking around it's frightening your body knows it's too fast and your brain which wants you to pump the brakes is pumped with adrenaline so let's kick this off i'm given the thumbs up and it's go time modest throttle initially there's no need to launch and then bury the throttle once we know we've got good traction even without launching i'm at a hundred miles per hour in less than eight seconds continuing to build speed i enter the corner in fifth gear fear creeps in and i lift a little bit still accelerating but much more slowly but i ease back into it so by the time i've exited the corner i've been flat out for a good while then it simply eyes up foot down and keep it relatively centered any natural movements i tried to just let the car go with it but again keeping it towards the middle and boom right there the magic moment happens my poor choice of camera angle means we don't have the full speedo but we can see the beautiful 2 as in 200 miles per hour 35 seconds into the run but we're not done yet the mclaren still has more in the tank as i ride the throttle all the way to the car's limited top speed of 212 miles per hour with the speedometer reading 213. it chills here with the engine holding steady as everything around me violently passes by the finish line arrives i lift gently ease onto the brakes to get speeds down to something reasonable and yeah i've done it holy i've done it 200 miles per hour and like a true nerd i say v-max v-max wow so a few comments on this i actually got to do two runs and it was exciting for the second run to not have any pressure knowing i'd already hit 200 miles per hour the corner is really intimidating even if it looks really casual on video i came out of it on both my runs at about 170 miles per hour which made reaching the top speed possible also what i found to be the easiest way to remain calm was to look as far ahead as possible the further you looked out the less you noticed how quickly everything around you was moving which keeps you pointed in the right direction and keeps your heart rate slightly lower now these are stiffly sprung cars so it's a little bumpy but honestly it didn't feel bad and watching the footage back it looked mildly more chaotic than it felt something i did find interesting as i looked at my eyes checking the speedometer the glance from eyes up to eyes onto the speedo to eyes back on the road was a 0.4 second round trip in those four tenths of a second with my eyes off the road i traveled 124 feet where nearly half a football field i'm traveling an entire football field in distance every second that passes by as someone who's never experienced this it's difficult to describe how bonkers fast this feels also worth mentioning my second run later in the day took a lot longer to reach 213 miles per hour on speedometer why i'm told there were times with 10 mile per hour headwinds and also temperatures had risen significantly meaning it's now harder for the engines to make as much power as we've learned both of these factors can play a big role in top speed another fun fact on my first run the speed trap recorded 259 miles per hour and while it was wrong it does technically mean that i have the highest speed read by the speed trap at this event even beating the previous record set by a bugatti she run of 253 miles per hour the speed trap was recalibrated for my second run and the speed trap speedometer and gps all indicated well over 200 miles per hour which was my original goal and i'm gonna keep telling myself i hold the record technically now i need to give a huge thank you to the entire crew making up the sun valley tour de force they're super professional keep things safe and have eyes all over the roads during your run to make sure nothing is going to obstruct your path the slightest disturbance whether it's some brush blowing onto the road or an animal or even an influencer trying to get too close to the roadway for a better video shot and they call to run radio in your ear you slow to a stop and reset it certainly helped my confidence to have these safety measures in place now just driving this thing on these beautiful roads this is a really special car it's it's incredibly fun it's well planted it gives you confidence going at these crazy speeds and it's got a little bite to it too it's got a little uh wild side to it which i like so it's it's been a blast beautiful scenery cool looking cars uh i've just had so much fun out here thanks to mclaren for having me out here let me check this out thank you all so much for watching if you have any questions or comments feel free to
