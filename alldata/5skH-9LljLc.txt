the upcoming release postponed two more weeks and lacks async functions is this not our life like every single day like this is a programmer's life is that what ended up happening is that you promised something it gets delayed and it comes out with less features this is every triple A game release ever created in the universe okay and it feels bad I feel bad I'm sorry Andrew for those that don't know anything about Andrew if you go on Twitter and you go look for this one tweet I recently just made uh right here where Andrew 15 years ago asked how do you open a file in C plus plus so frustrated by the C plus plus language created Zig clearly that's what ended up happening right there wild right all right so hi everyone I've been saying the upcoming zero 11 release of Zig would have async await suspend resume for nine months now you can probably find 10 different places where I promised in writing or in front of a camera that the next release would have have this feature well today I'm renegging uh sorry about that feel free to be annoyed at me that's totally fair given the situation yeah you know what can we okay we all just do a feels bad right here can we just do a feels bad um here's the here's the deal like I have great sympathy for this guy uh in the sense that first off shouldering and writing a language is incredibly hard they want to get rid of the llvm back end uh they want to so that way you can have your you know something a little bit lighter weight they want to be able to do all these different things and those are just huge massive pieces of work in on themselves and then also just trying to do language features and async await is not easy right you have to have an entire run time that's like really well done to do it and people just don't understand a lot of times what goes into this and then you also just have tooling right they wanted to have a package manager as part of zero 11. they wanted to be able to have uh you know better LSP support they want to be able to have all these things like there's a ton of stuff going on here and so feels bad I do not have a big chunk of work implemented in a branch let's see I do have a big chunk of work implemented in a branch however each time I press forward there I realize that to do things properly I would need to First switch tasks and approve the code base this resulted and for example the massive intern pool change set which is mostly invisible to the zig users but accomplishes these things let's just just let's just take a look what do you think ten thousand lines no no no no I I really hope that someone's Justice it like looks good to me oh my goodness there's not a single looks good to me but look at this I mean this is just this is just like impossible work like what are you like looks good to me right like dude like you no one can review this change it's it's literally impossible so like feels bad this is intern pull three there had to be an intern pull two and one that he got so far into it he was just like I gotta start over this is unrelenting I feel bad feels bad honestly and this makes async functions easier to implement makes semantic analysis more contributor friendly and less bug a prone takes a big step towards income incremental compilation further reduces memory requirements of the compiler these are all really great things and I'm happy to see all this fantastic right even after those changes landed when I cracked open async function Branch again I was compelled to rework generic function calls this accomplished more of the same four bullet points but it used up that time I had allocated to work on async functions and now the release is upon us this is a strong feels uh I could delay the release yet again however in it is a reality that most real world Zig projects today do not depend on these experimental features and the bottom lines that the project will benefit more from releasing now than from waiting until async function support is restored so the only thing left to do for the releases are type up the release notes so many release notes dear Lord have mercy on my soul tyrion's remaining issues on the 11 mile Milestone most the issues will be punted to 12 or 1 1 or 11 1 solve the remaining critical issues that sounds critical merge some PRS that have been patiently waiting for my attention I'm looking at you 15 382 just a just a little fun fact what is this one uh support packs headers and gnu long form name link oh feels bad that someone's done this and it's just been hanging out for weeks I totally get that uh I appreciate your grace in this matter I don't love failing to deliver a feature that definitely I definitely promise but I insist that Zig compiler code base is better off with these changes that we worked on instead it'll be worth it in the end sincerely Andrew P.S I'm not on Twitter anymore my goal is to it uh is to instead channel that micro blogging energy into my regular blogging energy on my personal website as well as this Pro okay this is actually really good I mean I would always recommend being on Twitter I actually tried to find them because I tried to tag him in that tweet I made and I couldn't find him I the only reason why I recommend doing that is that Twitter is kind of like the top of funnel right it's just you to be able to shout Into The Ether and people to know what's happening and you don't have to use Twitter like you don't have to be completely engaged on Twitter right you can just tweet things you cannot like anything you cannot follow it you don't even have to read any of the timeline but it's a good like little uh thing uh people that say F Twitter and all that I get it but you're probably not trying to create a product right here's the deal people follow people people want to hear from people and so if you the creator of Zig want people to hear you quick this is how you do it right uh threads threads is garbage threads dude do you really think threads is going to take off like did anybody here's the deal everyone that speaks Twitter's demise coming up and how the next social media platform is going to overtake Twitter you should just see right through it right okay can we just stop with the hype cycle just for like a moment remember when mastodons were all flooding in and being like it's the greatest thing ever realize that they all got a bunch of Reddit moderators moderating their server and reading their DMS and they're like wow that's not as good as I once thought it might be and then most of them came back right and then Blue Sky came out the Twitter killer and then it just turns out again it's just a bunch of dummies and then threads came out twang but this one only lasted literally for like three days and you can always tell you can always tell when something doesn't work you know how you can always tell is when people post pictures of them posting on the Twitter killer on Twitter okay that fundamentally means it doesn't work you don't do that okay if you stop using Myspace you don't go to Myspace to post about how you are using Facebook on MySpace okay like that doesn't because you should just know that you should just see it coming right you leave the platform anyway sorry for that weird rant it's just so stupid anyways great way to a great way to engage people that you may it may not be able to but I really like Zig I really love a lot of the things Zig is doing if I were to do a project that required c-level type stuff I would just use Zig because I think Zig is the truest successor to see in the sense that it has really great uh it's either Zig or Odin those are like the true successors to see oh Odin is super interesting geared more towards game programming a lot of really great niceties uh I think Zig did win in a couple categories I love that they have options I love that they did that and they actually made it kind of like a you know null pointers are actually just optionals and you really do have to handle it at a syntax level I really love that they did try and catch not try catches and throwing errors but what go really needs to do right which is just better error handling there's a lot of great things about Zig and you gotta appreciate somebody that's spending their life building a language right you gotta appreciate somebody that started 15 years ago not knowing how to open a file in C plus plus and now has a very popular hugely amazing uh language out there okay we all gotta appreciate that let's appreciate it put the respect on there great designed language great replacement for c um very impressed the name the primage
