hey friends welcome back to my channel today 
we are going to be going through how to create   and sell an nft on openc this tutorial is a no 
code tutorial so whether you can code or not   code or are very technical or not 
this is something that you can do   and we're going to do it all in under 
10 minutes before we get into it though   make sure to hit that subscribe button 
for more tech and coding related videos   leave down in the comments other videos you want 
to see and without further ado let's get into it   okay the first thing we need to do to create 
and sell an nft is we need to have a wallet   for this tutorial we are going to be signing 
up for metamask i already have an account but   i'm going to make another one just so we can 
follow along together first thing we need   to do is navigate to metamask.io from 
there we need to click on download now from there go into your extensions and 
click on metamask okay let's get started if you're new to metamask we're 
going to go to create a wallet create a new password and then they will always give you 
a secret recovery phrase so make   sure to write down your secret recovery 
phrase or your secret word somewhere else okay there we go as you can see we just set 
up our first wallet our first virtual wallet   is pretty easy the rest of the tutorial i promise 
you will be just as easy as this okay next up we   are going to go on openc openc essentially you 
can think of as a platform where you can bid on   buy sell nfts for this next step we 
need to connect our wallet to openc   from here we are going to sign up 
to go profile connect your wallet go next connect account and 
there you go we are connected   it is that easy next up let's create a 
collection so let's go to my collections create a collection then it's asking for a signature request sign okay here we go so we need to have a few 
things required one being a logo image   i guess i should stop and pause here and you're 
probably wondering tiff what is your nft you're   going to be selling well of course if you 
know me it's going to be a photo of my dog my   prize my love my dogs i'm not actually 
once i have this up i'm probably gonna   take it down right away just because uh 
this is more for tutorial purposes but   yes for my nft it will be a photo of my dog 
so for logo image it makes sense to have   my dogs this image will be used for featuring 
your collection on the homepage category pages etc   banner image we're not going to do any of these 
but once again feel free to fill these out   the name of our collection is going to be 
dirty harry and mr mugs the name of my dogs is the coolest then you can do many other things such as add 
category links creator earnings the more you fill   out the more validity it brings to your collection 
okay you can add creator earnings as well as   select the blockchain where you'd like your 
new items from this collection to be added to   so let's do three here then you need to add a 
payout wallet address so go back to your wallet   okay so that looks good let's go create okay there you can see we have our 
collection dirty harry and mr mugs   right now it says no items to display so 
now we need to add an item okay last thing   we need to do is actually upload our nft you 
can see it's kind of getting dark already so   i feel like i need to speed this up quickly 
uh because i need to eat dinner and so does   harry and mr mugs speaking of the boys so 
let's go do just that click on add item me it's going to be harry and muggs dh and mr mugs okay we can see this is already part of the dirty 
harry in mr mugs collections then you can also add   a ton of different things from properties levels 
stats and different things to the collection   supply the number of items that can be minted   and as i mentioned it'd be on the 
blockchain with ethereum okay let's do this amazing we just created our 
first nft and now can sell it   so as you see here it's all up 
here all the details if we go sell then right here we can put list item for sale 
in which we will give either a fixed price or   you can also give an auction price then how much 
you're going to sell it for the duration it's   going to be up for and then from there click 
on complete listing okay so as i mentioned i'm   not actually going to sell this nft because 
it's not something that i put a lot of work   into or i'm passionate about and i don't know 
if i want someone owning my dog they're just   they're everything to me but i hope 
this tutorial was really helpful in   understanding just how simple it is to connect 
your wallet to openc get your nft up there and   start selling it it's really that easy i think a 
lot of times when it comes to blockchain or nfts   people think they need to be very tech savvy 
in order to start participating which is not   the case at all thanks for watching this video 
i hope you found it very valuable and helpful   leave in the comments other videos you want to 
see and i will see you all soon thanks everyone oh   you
