all right are you guys ready for this Terry Davis on Simplicity you love this video rip Terry yeah an idiot admires complexity a genius admires Simplicity a physicist tries to make it simple anyway an idiot anything the more complicated it is the more he will admire it if you make something so cluster [ __ ] T can't understand it he's gonna think you're a God because you made it so complicated nobody can understand it that's the other right journals in academic journals they they try to make it so complicated people think you're a genius okay anyway so it's good advice it's good advice everybody it's good advice complexity does not necessarily mean anything good I agree with that that's all I gotta say on that one let's just get that one out of there I just feel so bad for that whole situation so we're just gonna move on so I've always wanted to watch like a document uh documentary on this programming war crimes oh baby programming war crimes [Music] okay can I be real for a second here I had code identical to this just just literally this morning just this morning I looked at this and I was like what the [ __ ] am I doing here it had to it had to like erase just erase it just let the thing throw what am I doing here why Billy why Billy oh my God this is actually too real and this actually hurts me just a little bit okay this hurts me a little bit [Music] what what this is just here to hurt me this is just here to hurt me this is this not even this is not real this is purely meant to be a ploy against my emotions Swift Everyone likes Swift [Music] there are so many things here that make me angry I can't even begin to describe oh these are awful I was not emotionally prepared for what we're looking at right now I was not prepared right now for this oh no oh no what am I looking at [Music] uh-huh [Music] I was at Netflix and I kid you not that oh man I don't want to say his name but he he was like yo yo come over here look at this he was looking at some partner code it was literally this this is like identical representation to this at Netflix cream of the crop right baby no man I was like that cannot be real they're like it's real I'm like I was emotionally bruised at that point [Music] I don't know that's just kind of funny right you're just teaching someone that print is that it takes in many arguments okay this is a great introduction to programming okay it's really the capital letter variable names that are the most egregious part of this entire thing right here [Music] 240 is the only is it because it's in Microsoft docs like what's the problem here [Music] is that what that's supposed to be what the hell is it I can't even read this I actually can't even read this okay that's just scratch okay hey good for whatever kid made this okay can we all can we give claps out to the kid that grunted through this and made his robot do little spin dance moves did orange Justice the most over dance the dance move on fortnite by all 11 year old boys can we all just congratulate him right now thank you very much for the orange Justice scratch rep you know representation here very beautiful [Music] I've heard about this mailbox program but apparently it's just like impossible it's a programming language meant to be hard I feel like those ones aren't as funny this one's just emotionally painful that someone's writing in cursive but these ones aren't necessarily funny I like those first couple those ones were really good the cursive is a little upsetting okay again the quality's so low but is that is that get are we looking at a get is this is this supposed to be is this supposed to be git right here is this is this Dev is this is this git flow it's a get Forest ah it's a bonsai tree how do you trim the bonsai tree do I have to wax some some someone on or off [Music] it took me a second I was like okay where's the thing that's changing and then you just oh no and it just is adding 200 to it oh my goodness the best part is that first number is this oh my goodness it's aesthetic 200 this is beautiful [Music] I've seen one of these before [Music] I just love the fact that JavaScript that when Brendan Ike wrote it he thought that would be a good idea the sword needs to work on everything let's just make it all a string let's just make it all a string why not what's the worst that could happen [Music] is that co-pilot I don't even know what that is [Music] you know this is a great programming exercise you know sometimes in my younger years when like an intern would come in and ask me like and want to interview I would ask them fizzbuzz just to see like do they even know what a map is fizzbuzz is a great question because then when you go like this when they get to this point and you go what happens if you want to add seven as baz and they start trying to write it with a bunch of if statements and you go is there anything else you could use like anything better and they go no you know you can kind of just kind of know you just kind of know you just kind of know in that point that it's just not looking good okay bye Billy get the hell up Billy [Applause] I cannot believe how much YouTube recommends me my own videos you know you would think at this point that they wouldn't do that you know what I mean like just by at this point you'd think okay hey this is the same owner of the same account maybe we don't need them to have all the same crap you know but no no they don't
