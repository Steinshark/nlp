hey did you know 4k often isn't actually 4k what even though tons of electronics companies advertise screens game consoles and streaming sticks with 4k support there's actually no real standard for what the heck 4k really means it's just a word it's just it's just made up you see 4k is called 4k because it refers to resolutions that are approximately 4 000 pixels across the most common resolution that's advertised as 4k is 3840 pixels horizontally by 2160 pixels vertically which is what you typically see on tvs and computer monitors often marketed as ultra hd or uhd and so this resolution isn't quite 4000 pixels across but the 4k used in movie production called dci 4k measures 4096 by 2160 so the aspect ratio is about 1.9 to 1. a little wider than the typical 1.78 to 1 we're used to on tvs and your typical computer monitor you might know that aspect ratio by its other name 16x9 but dci 4k isn't the only movie 4k as it's primarily used for shooting the film by the time you get to the movie theater though you're probably seeing the film in cinemascope 4k this sounds awfully fancy but the actual resolution is only 4096 by 1716 and while that produces the 2.39 to 1 aspect ratio that looks cinematic a typical 4k display at home has over one and a quarter million more pixels so don't be fooled into thinking you're supposed to be seeing the latest blockbuster in some kind of mind-blowing detail you're mostly just cutting off the top and bottom to further illustrate this point some products cut down resolution even further to get that cinematic widescreen look sony's line of xperia phones are known for this with their trademark cinema wide 4k displays but cinemawide is actually just a cut down version of garden variety uhd with a resolution of 3840x1644 to achieve a more theatrical 21x9 aspect ratio similar to many ultrawide monitors of course we're not trying to say these displays are bad as they're still good-looking oled screens with hdr support just don't expect more pixels than you'd get on a 300 tv this illustrates why 2160p isn't an exact synonym for 4k even though many people might want to call it that since we often refer to hd by its vertical resolution 1080p we've already covered two resolutions marketed as 4k with vertical resolutions falling well short of 2160 pixels and on the other side of that coin there are products like dash cams advertised as 4k because they're 2160p but less than 3000 pixels across producing a more square looking video that isn't really close to what we typically think of as 4k so why why do we use incomplete terms like 2160p in the first place it's actually a weird historical holdover that we'll tell you about right after we thank freshbooks the invoicing and accounting solution that's built

displays you know those big heavy tvs and monitors we used until the late 2000s and are still used today at really cool super smash bros tournaments crts didn't have pixels in the sense that we think of them today rather they generated horizontal lines that contained analog data which varied as you went across the screen in other words they had a vertical resolution but not a horizontal one this is why the industry used terms like 480i or 576 i to describe tv signals back when crts ruled the world with the i standing for interlaced meaning that a crt would only scan half the lines of a frame at once to save bandwidth by contrast the p in 1080p stands for progressive meaning the monitor scans the whole frame all at once but even though modern lcd displays have a defined horizontal and vertical resolution the practice of using a single three or four digit number to represent the entire resolution stuck around but even if a product clearly states both its horizontal and vertical resolution you really need both that information and the size of the display to get across how much detail it can convey since a 4k resolution doesn't really mean much if you're sitting two feet away from a 200 inch screen which is why the 8k tvs on the market are mostly they're really big so isn't there a better way than 2160p to describe how much detail a display can show it yeah it turns out that there is indeed it's a spec called pixels per inch or ppi which is just what it sounds like the number of pixels in a one inch line ppi combined with aspect ratio gives you a really good idea of what the actual visual experience will be like and this system is used by none other than apple who uses it as the basis for the retina display marketing wow they were actually right about something
