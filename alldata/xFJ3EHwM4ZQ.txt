hello everyone and welcome in this video we're gonna be talking all about diesel fuel and diesel engines we're going to be answering questions like what causes diesel engines to lose power and efficiency over time how do diesel engines work how our modern diesel engines changing and how does fuel have a significant impact on the way modern diesel engines operate so first off a huge thank you to Exxon Mobil for sponsoring this video they actually provided me access to their engineers so I could ask all kinds of questions and learn all kinds of information about diesel fuel and I was even able to visit a third-party test facility where Exxon Mobil's latest diesel fuel synergy diesel efficient fuel was tested and I was able to see how they were able to verify the claims they make about this fuel so let's start at the very beginning what is diesel fuel well diesel fuel is obviously the fuel used in diesel engines and it is a mixture of hydrocarbons of a certain range in size so you derive this from crude oil and crude oil has all kinds of different hydrocarbons within it some of them are very large and some are much smaller so the key is to separate them into their different categories and take out the portion that you want for diesel fuel and so this is the distillation process the refinery process of crude oil so you take crude oil you then boil that crude heating it up to quite high temperatures and then you send it through a distillation column so this distillation column is warmer at the bottom and cooler at the top so as you have this gaseous oil flowing through this distillation column the heavier longer molecules will condense sooner at higher temperatures meaning they'll separate out towards the bottom versus those smaller lighter hydrocarbons they won't condense until much cooler temperatures so they raise up much higher within this distillation column and so you're able to separate out the different hydrocarbons at different layers and hydrocarbons of various sizes have various uses so those larger ones that come right out at the bottom those are going to be kind of like a tar used for road oils a little bit higher you get to lubricating oils keep moving up into smaller molecules you get diesel fuel keep going even further in this refinery process further up this distillation column and we get gasoline so we're looking at hydro curve in the c8h18 range 8 carbons 18 hydrogen's vs diesel fuel somewhere in the range give or take of a/c 15 H 28 so at the top you have those lighter molecules that condense at lower temperatures at the bottom you have those heavier molecules the larger hydrocarbons that condense sooner now this is the traditional way of creating diesel fuel there are other ways to do it so you can take those larger hydrocarbon molecules and break them apart into the size you do want to be used as diesel fuel so what do we do with these hydrocarbons once we have them well we burn them of course to make power so the process is very similar to a gasoline engine but there are distinct differences so you have your intake compression power and exhaust strokes but there's a few little differences here so with the intake stroke you don't have a throttle generally speaking that's restricting that intake air and so as a result you have less pumping losses and diesels tend to be significantly more efficient for the compression stroke you tend to use higher compression ratios because you're not using spark ignition you're now using fuel to ignite it after that compression stroke has occurred they also you tend to use turbochargers and as a result they have more torque and generally speaking because of these higher compression ratios they're going to be more efficient so getting to our power stroke instead of a spark igniting that air fuel mixture ignition is timed based on when you inject that diesel fuel so this is a very critical component of how this entire engine works and then you have your exhaust cycle and a difference versus gasoline here is that diesels tend to run very lean as a result they have abundant oxygen available in the exhaust which means three-way catalytic converters like those used with gasoline engines aren't effective so different strategies like urea injection are used now I mention the importance of the injector and so this is an area where modern diesels are really trying to improve and two of the ways they're doing that are increasing the pressure extremely high pressures over 2,000 bar looking towards you know potentially working in the 3,000 bar range over 30,000 psi so significantly orders of magnitude higher than gasoline engines and they're also looking to decrease the size of the holes used and so the reasons for this with that higher pressure they're able to get better penetration within the cylinder and spread out that fuel as wide as possible as fast as possible also using those very small little ports little holes on the injector they're able to get a very fine mist that sprays out so the combination with high pressure and smaller injector holes means better overall efficiency and more power created through better penetration within the cylinder and a finer mist so it mixes better and burns very quickly but there are also emissions benefits to using a finer mist and using higher pressures and so if you kind of imagine you know this is kind of an extreme comparison here one injecting out quite further great cylinder penetration really spread out the fine mist versus you know kind of a richer area right here so if you think about if you were to burn all of this fuel in this area where all of this fuel in this area and you have the same quantity of fuel because this fuel is spread out over a larger area it's going to have lower local temperatures all of this fuel is being burned in a much smaller area so the overall temperature of that area is going to be higher and because the temperature of that area is higher Moore NOx emissions are going to form NOx emissions are correlated with temperature so the higher you get your temperatures then the more NOx emissions you have so you want to bring down local cylinder temperatures local internal temperatures within this cylinder so you can do that by spreading out the fuel as wide as possible the other thing is when you're spraying it and if you don't have great penetration and kundrot stays in this little dense area then you have a richer air fuel mixture within this area and what this leads to is more particulate matter forming because you don't have complete combustion occur in those richer pockets of the air fuel mixture so the benefit is not just in power and efficiency but also reducing particulate matter and reducing NOx emissions by having a better spray with that injector now here's where deposits come in and try to ruin everyone's day so deposits and diesel engines is nothing new it's the conditions that allow for that so you have high temperatures and pressures and this causes that fuel to oxidize which creates deposits within the combustion chamber and around those fuel injectors you can also have deposits form inside the nozzle the fuel undergoes heat and pressure changes as it's cycled through the fuel system the problem is that as modern diesel engines move towards finer and finer mists with very small holes on these injectors then they become susceptible and very sensitive to irregular spray patterns as a result of those deposits so a very small deposit just a few microns in size can create meaningful impacts on that spray quality of these injectors because those ports those injector holes are so small so deposits can affect the sprays pattern they can affect the sprays penetration and they can even affect the sprays flow and so ultimately this can mean a reduction in power a reduction in efficiency and an increase in emissions so how do we approach this deposits problem well in the United States in order for diesel fuel to be sold it must meet the industry standard which is ASTM D 9075 so this is the specification for diesel fuel in order for it to be sold which includes additives and a spec of all the different qualities about this fuel in order for it to be used in the US market so what ExxonMobil does is they take this ASTM D 90 75 specification diesel fuel and they add to that their proprietary additive package so this is what they are calling synergy diesel efficient fuel so they mix that in that is then put in a truck and sent to the station the fuel station and so ultimately what Exxon Mobil's goal is with this detergent annemun package is that it will reduce deposits which will improve the spray quality of those injectors and thus improve emissions and improve efficiency now the additive package that they're using is of course proprietary so we don't know what the chemical formula is of these detergents used but the whole idea behind detergents is that they'll attach to the deposits break them apart and then send them all downstream from the engine and so we can ask the question does their additive package actually work and so the results that they were able to obtain through testing was a 2% average improvement in fuel economy a 2% reduction in co2 emissions and an 11 percent reduction in NOx emissions so how do we know synergy diesel of fish fuel offers a meaningful benefit over the standard fuel at the pump ASTM D 9075 well to find out I visited one of the third party research facilities where the fuel was put to the test ranging from light duty diesel vehicles all the way up to semi trucks testing was performed on an indoors dynamometer to provide complete control over as many variables as possible to start the test passenger trucks were taken in with 20,000 to 50,000 miles on the odometer as well as semi trucks with approximately 350,000 miles light duty diesel engines can be expected to last around 200,000 miles or so while larger diesels for tractor-trailer applications can last around a million miles so vehicles were taken in with plenty of useful life remaining these vehicles were then completely conditioned to be in perfect operating shape oil change cleaning the diesel particulate filter and making sure everything works as it should before the test begins the vehicles then run 500 miles using AD 97 five standardized fuel to condition the engine for the start of the test only after these five hundred miles are completed is a baseline run measured where fuel economy and emissions data is recorded light duty vehicles are then run for about 5,000 miles while larger semi trucks are ran for about 30,000 miles all of these miles using synergy diesel efficient fuel after this the data for fuel economy and emissions is measured this is where the facility noticed that fuel consumption was improved by two percent on average with co2 reduced by two percent and NOx emissions reduced by 11 percent now you might wonder wait a minute we're measuring a two percent difference on a chassis dynamometer that's impossible what's the air bar well I thought the exact same thing and this test facility actually had to incorporate some special tools to make this all possible at the end of the day they were able to get a two percent improvement with standard deviation of just 0.4 percent meaning that statistically the two percent claim is easy to trust two pieces of equipment in particular made this measurement possible on top of all of the other many variables which were controlled first a torque meter at the beginning of the drive shaft was installed so that the engines output torque could be measured close to source rather than after the wheels using the dynamometer this provides a much more accurate repeatable test versus trying to hold torque constant that's traveling through the differentials wheels and tires and the many variables that affect each of these locations the second piece of equipment was a drive by wire system so that the exact throttle mapping could be matched from one test to the next rather than a human foot which would have increased air significantly a computer tells the engine exactly how much throttle and torque to make at any given time over the duration of the test which is then repeated over and over to obtain fuel economy and emissions results so ultimately what they found by using synergy diesel efficient fuel with its detergent additive package enough deposits were removed from injector nozzles which created a significant enough difference in the fuel injector spray quality which ultimately resulted in a two percent fuel economy benefit all with an error bar of 0.4 percent now does two percent matter well when you start to multiply that number across the number of vehicles in a fleet as well as the reduction in emissions associated with it it's quite a significant difference it could also mean a reduction in the consumption of diesel exhaust fluid for engines that use not sensors in the after treatment and adjust how much fluid is injected based on how much NOx is present again test results saw an 11 percent decrease in NOx emissions and if deposits caused enough of a restriction to fuel flow it could mean restoring top-end power where max flow is needed by reducing deposits it's important to state that these improvements come from restoring the original injector spray quality and getting the engine to run like it did when it was brand new as someone who has worked as a test engineer before this whole YouTube thing it was awesome to get a behind-the-scenes tour of the test facility and see up close just how much effort went into obtaining useful data and results quite impressive that they were able to get the air bar down to just 0.4 percent and see meaningful improvements in fuel economy and emissions synergy diesel efficient fuel is currently in the process of rolling out across North America where it will be available at Exxon stations and mobile stations as well as a global rollout available at esos stations a huge thank you to Exxon Mobil for sponsoring the video and thank you all for
