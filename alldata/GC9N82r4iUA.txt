[Music] thank you I feel like every week in tech we are just breaking down barriers creating new Innovations it just keeps on getting Wilder and Wilder and this week was no different today I'm going to be sharing with you the top news in Tech that happened this past week from potentially curing some cancers with AI to now neuralink testing with actual humans and so much more alright before we get into it make sure to hit that subscribe button so you never miss out on any Tech news or anything really Tech related stay ahead of the game also to leave in the comments anything else that happened that was big this past week in tech all right let's get into it this has been a long time in the making musk finally got approval for human trials for his company neuralink now this approval came from an independent review board that has given him the thumbs up to start beginning recruitment for the first human trial of its brain implant this is really interesting so they are going to start with paralysis patients so anyone who has a cervical spinal Accord injury may qualify for the study but it doesn't share exactly how many participants would be enrolled or anything else really about it it does say though it will take about six years to complete I really am curious about this it's been in the works for so long and this next step with human trials I think is going to be really interesting now here's a question for you would you if you could qualify or if you do qualify participate in this it does it does seem really interesting and could help out a lot of people curious to get your thoughts on this one okay this next one he hasn't been in the news for a minute actually that big of news anyways but we're all familiar with him Sam bankman free and we all know he is the founder of now the collapsed cryptocurrency company FTX now he was sent to Jail recently for many many of the crimes that he committed but he's back in the news again not for the reason you think this time it's actually with Apple so there are reports circulating that Apple has paid five million dollars for book deals this is big business they are now leaning on him to have the rights for this book that is being created on his story I'm curious to hear though five million dollars to have the rights for this are you going to be reading this book okay coming in at number three is moderna's CEO went on uh I'm not really familiar with this before semaphore have you heard of this article or blog channel before well he went on it did an interview and he really shared a lot of interesting insights around AI especially how they will be leaning on artificial intelligence specifically machine learning to help them identify uh cancer cells and create specific treatments for that now let me let me read you a bit here so in this interview the CEO really describes how its machine learning approach to drug development could one day successfully treat cancer he said cancer is a disease of the DNA when it mutates a body's immune system was built to attack these cancer cells so what they're going to do is after finding which cells have mutated moderna can use its algorithm to identify a tumorous genetic mutations to Target only cancer cells and not healthy ones this is pretty interesting I think we hear a lot in the news of the negativity of AI and how it's going to take over the world and all this really fear-mongering stuff so I really wanted to include this story in this week's news updates around Tech because there is so much positive that can come out of artificial intelligence as well and this is a really good example of just that all right someone else who is famous from being in the news can you guess who I'm going to speak about next if you guessed Elon Musk you are correct but not shocking that it's going to be about him Elon Musk has suggested he needed to keep X in the news and keep it you know exciting and his recent big claims which I mean listen some most of his claims around X have come true whether we like it or not his most recent one is that social media platform X will go behind a paywall now this isn't a conversation he he was having with the Israeli Prime Minister he said we are moving to having a small monthly payment for the use of the system now this reason or the reason for this is to hopefully counter Bots there is a huge bot problem on x and by putting up this paywall it is to the idea behind it is to prevent Bots from continuing to grow on X he goes on to say a bot costs a fraction of a penny to make but if somebody even has to pay a few dollars or something some minor amount the effective cost to bots is very high this is interesting and I think it could be one way to mitigate or at least slow down the bot problem on X would you still use x though if you had to pay for it all right on the note of Elon Musk let's move over to starlink so they actually just recently had their finances leaked and it says in these reports on Wall Street Journal that spacex's starlink made 1.4 billion dollars last year now that sounds like an astronomical amount of money because it is however what's really interesting about this is that although it is up 222 million in 2021 it is 11 billion 11 billion short of its original projections so they definitely are very sharp from what they were aiming for in other news with starlink the 17th liftoff and Landing for Falcon 9th first stage uh occurred actually a few hours ago from when I'm filming this and with that was 22 starlink satellites that were deployed from Falcon 9's upper stage 62 minutes after 62.5 if we want to be specific after the launch was planned this obviously was a successful launch and it actually broke some records it was spacex's 65th orbital mission of the Year pretty cool all right next up on the list is instacart and this I was wondering why this was getting so many headlines at first but I'm reading here on CNBC actually that instacart is the first notable venture-backed tech company to hit the U.S public Market since December 2021 that is quite a while actually and so yes instacart goes IPO which is very exciting they closed up 12 in the NASDAQ after the debut after first day rally sputters now instacart for those of you who might not be familiar I'm sure all of you are but it was founded in 2012 actually so yeah 11 years ago wow I remember first hearing about it and in early 2021 with consumers stuck at home this is when it really started to take off and now it's become really a household name I'm curious are you going to be investing in this okay next on the list is next and last on the list this is ending with a big one which is France it's apparently halting iPhone 12 sales over radiation levels so this is reported on the BBC and uh yeah they are saying that Francis ordered Apple to stop selling the iPhone 12 because it is emitting too much electro magnetic electromagnetic radiation now Apple has actually told the BBC that it is contesting this review saying it had provided the regular tour with lab results from the tech giant itself and third parties which show the device is compliant with all relevant rules so there is this friction here we'll see what ends up happening regardless if it is within the radiation limits or not it definitely made me feel weird about putting my iPhone next to my bed while I sleep like right next to my head just having this thought in my head I mean it's things you won't we know about but then when we hear that something like this might have the potential to be banned from getting sold in certain countries it kind of just makes me feel a little bit weird I don't have the iPhone 12 I have the iPhone what do I have I think I have the iPhone how do I not know what phone I have what does this say about me I have the iPhone 14 pro Max uh and I love it but still it's very interesting to start thinking about what that looks like and what that really means all right those are the top biggest things to happen in Tech this past week so you don't have to spend hours reading about it and researching that is what I'm here for you can watch this in under 10 minutes hopefully this is under 10 minutes you can watch this in QuickTime and be up to date for what is going on in Tech so you know for when you're speaking with your friends your colleagues your head of the game alright I will see you all soon hit that subscribe button bye everyone foreign [Music]
