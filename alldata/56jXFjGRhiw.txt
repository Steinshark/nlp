I'm here to settle the beef guys as you know I've been a good boy lately no no fights just vegetarian no beef until recently I got in a little bit of a Twitter fight with the world's richest Gambler a man who supposedly made 360 million dollars gambling and has nothing better to do than go back and forth with me so I'm here to settle it today once and for all because I admit I started off a little heated I called him a dirt bag for making you know basically his fortune off the backs of his viewers because he promoted to them gambling and he didn't like that he he came back at me with both gloves off he said I thought he meaning I was a credible Source until I read this trash referring to something I had just written um and to that I I just have to stop it right there and say you used to think I was credible now unfortunately for him this is the biggest cope I hear all the time I used to think coffee Zilla was credible but then he talked about me now actually one recent hit video came out by a guy called coffee Zillow actually kind of respected and thought Had a Brain but whatever I loved coffeezilla and then he talked about my thing we hear it all the time okay let's continue though let's continue let's not hold it against him he thinks I glamorized gambling now I know where he gets his news from he also says this guy clearly doesn't watch nor has he ever watched me everything he's saying is the opposite of who I am what I do now what is this in reference to okay well it's a recent Revelation that train wrecks made if you don't know he's one of the biggest uh gambling streamers before twitch banned gambling recently and just two days ago there policy change went into effect meaning stake's number one employee train wrecks he just got released from contract right he's no longer employed by them because he can't really promote them uh and because of that he decided that I guess he's gonna come clean and just say you know what he made I'll release what I got paid since the beginning of my contract I've been paid 360 million dollars for 16 months of gambling there you go wow every time I've heard that and I've played that clip multiple times it's still always a shocking amount of money 360 million in 16 months promotingstate.com now we'll talk in a second about whether this number's real it's been a lot of talk a lot of people don't think it's possible that this number's real even for the numbers we've heard on stake.com which people get paid Millions a month um to promote gambling on there it's excessive even for that but we'll talk about that in a second the point is I responded to that by saying because he posted this clip or somebody posted this clip of him saying this I said what a crazy thing to brag about getting paid 360 million to gamble train arcs only got paid that because he converted viewers into losers for the casino what a dirt bag I then say it isn't complicated gambling is addictive it has the highest rate of any addiction and that people like train glamorize degenerate gambling and this is where I lost my spotless reputation with train okay because according to him he doesn't claim rice gambling he calls himself and I quote The anti-gambling Gambler I'm not kidding and if you can tell me what that is if you can tell me how you can be an anti-gambling Gambler professionally gambling for millions of dollars 16 hours a day you let me know okay but I do want to take him seriously for a second that's actually why I'm making this video is it true that you can uh not glamorize gambling while making hundreds of millions of dollars is that true I wanted to kind of think about that for a second because my initial thought was you know they're probably better and worse ways to do it but you're always going to be the least dirty of the dirt bags if that makes sense it's never really a you're not gonna Never Gonna feel good about it but I wanted to go over you know the full case I wanted to go over why train wrecks TV calls himself The anti-gambling Gambler because in some ways it is true that unlike other streamers who used fake money he claimed he used real money unlike other streamers who highlighted only their wins train wrecks would highlight his losses I think it's train wreck do not gamble idiots you understand if you watch the entire context of all my gambling over 15 months you'll see it as 99.8 percent [ __ ] losing you might say that okay that's positive you know I I can acknowledge that what Steve will do it was doing on rubette was probably worse than what train was doing on state because Steve will do it was just kind of Faking everything however do you know who actually made more money for the casinos at the end of the day despite all the claims of being like this like woke anti-gambling Gambler train by a long shot he is one of the top gambling streamers getting paid the most for his gambling content and we all know why that is these business deals don't happen from nowhere they don't just make up the numbers oh you get 50 million you get five million you get one million they're based on getting people in the door you get paid because you get people to play you can Shuffle the numbers around whatever but you'll never get your deal get canceled if you're not pulling in the numbers that's just the bottom line okay so the very fact that he says that I made 360 million dollars if that's true he at least pulled in 360 million dollars for the casino that's basically that admission and that's why I'm saying wow what what a scumbag right so this is where I think as a streamer no matter how based you are you know like trains you know he puts in the top right hand corner of his stream like don't gamble you'll lose and then the other 95 of the like screen is him gambling um I think no matter how much you do that gambling 16 hours a day you can't help but glamorize it why well because the opposite of glamorizing something is being realistic right that's obvious and showing the reality of gambling would be train would gamble for about 10 seconds spending a thousand dollars a spin and run out of money instead he gets to gamble 16 hours a day or eight hours a day whatever he does for an entire 16 months and he makes money makes millions of dollars right that is a glamorous picture of gambling no matter how much you you preach about oh guys I'm just doing it and making millions I don't want you to do it oh please don't don't care don't gamble so no matter how much he talks about his losses it can only be so real when he shows up the next day and Gamble balls again I also want to quickly address the other side of this argument of personal accountability shouldn't people who gamble because they watch train wreck streams uh be accountable themselves and yeah to some extent I think you should be on the other hand I only think you should take accountability when these streamers take accountability because there's a whole other side to this as much as people like train want to say that uh the problem is no one wants to take responsibility for their own actions he he's the one who doesn't take responsibility for his own actions he wants to be seen as some woke anti-gambling gambler but also get to reap the rewards of promoting gambling and getting tons of people to gamble he's unwilling to just own the fact that he made a casino probably over 360 million dollars like if people can be accountable for losing their life savings why can't you be accountable for what you did here's the deal they have no problem taking accountability when it comes to taking their cut of the check right like when State goes to him and goes hey here's your 20 million for the month for all these people you signed up train wrecks doesn't go whoa whoa whoa that wasn't me that was their personal accountability nah he's like yeah I did a I promoted that I got these guys in the door you pay me my money and fair enough he did get him in the door but as soon as it's as soon as he gets the slightest amount of Social pushback and people are like wow that's actually pretty scummy that you do that for money he's like oh my gosh I can't believe you're accusing me of glamorizing gambling it's like yeah you're paid to do that you did a great job of it why why can't he take personal accountability for that that's sort of my whole problem with this is like people want it only on one side they want the guy who gambled to take personal accountability but the guy who got him in the door he no problem over here no we have to ignore this guy right that's sort of my problem with this whole thing I think train tries to you know um dismiss this fact by saying that he really doesn't make steak.com that much money this guy he calls into question the whole claim of 360 million he says 22.5 million per month I call Cap ain't no way he generates that much value per month train responds I don't they lose money on me it's how I can gamble as a anti-gambling gambler now I don't know if he's like willfully delusional here or he's just lying it's straightforward business guys if you believe this it's ridiculous no business is going to offer you a deal if they are going to get a add Roi they're either expecting long-term profits or short-term profits there's no other way they're going to pay you okay this is ridiculous he's trying to pretend like he's the he's like got in The Matrix underneath and like is secretly subvertingstake.com and running them at a negative no shot he's making the millions of dollars a month and he's getting paid for that because that's how this works if he wasn't bringing in more money than he was making they would have cut the deal off yesterday now I do want to say though this isn't to say that this 360 million dollar number is accurate and uh I agree that this seems outrageous although it could be real a real number without being accurate uh this could be the amount like he got after you factor in the amount he lost back to stake like they could have factored in that he was going to gamble roughly 200 300 million of it over the lifetime of that contract so we really don't know how much that breaks down how much he was bringing home but I think it's fair to say that he made a fortune off the back of his viewers who gambled away a fortune while watching him but anyways I just wanted to show the hypocrisy of this whole like woke anti-gambling Gambler thing where you can have it both ways of like oh I'm making millions of dollars getting people to gamble but also I'm like the good guy though I'm like the good one I'm the good good guy getting him in the door either way you're getting people like hooked right that's the whole purpose of this whole thing so uh yeah I don't know personal accountability runs both ways if if you can say that someone's responsible for for walking in the door I can say you're a scumbag for showing up the door anyways yeah that's it that's the beef bye
