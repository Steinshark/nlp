if a game involves aspects of randomness and 
chance is it possible for one player to be so   lucky while playing that game that we can say with 
mathematical certainty that they are officially   too lucky this is actually the most requested 
video topic i have ever had because just over   a month ago there was some big drama in 
the minecraft community one of the most   popular players someone called dream they've got 
over 15 million subscribers on youtube they're   probably on twitch as well i don't know but 
they were accused of cheating because in their   minecraft speed runs they were having incredibly 
good luck and because all the arguments against   them all the proof that they were cheating 
was based on probability and statistics an   overwhelming number of you got in touch with me 
and asked if i could take a closer mathematical   look at it and i was very happy to do so and 
my goodness there were some interesting results   but a beard how long did that take to film [Music]   i know a lot has already been said about the dream 
speed run controversy but i think i'm actually   quite well placed to make a video about it because 
i am a disinterested party that's not to say   i'm not uninterested like i am interested in 
what's going on but i haven't got an interest   like an investment in either of the two parties 
so i'm disinterested i don't care who's right   but i'm interested i want to make sure we get 
to that right answer and we're going to have   a pretty wide spectrum of people watching 
this video if you're here for the minecraft   first of all welcome to the channel 
i'll try and go through the maths   as clearly as i can if you're here for the maths 
regular viewers thanks for showing up uh i also   didn't know much about minecraft before this so i 
will try to go through the minecraft details nice   and carefully some friends of mine had given me a 
lot of help so we'll start with a very quick recap   of what the controversy was minecraft is a game 
that can be played in many different ways some   players just want to explore the landscape mine 
resources and craft items other players however   like to achieve some kind of objective and 
effectively you know complete the game and in   minecraft java edition 1.16 you can finish the 
game by killing an ender dragon and of course   the moment you can finish a video game 
people are going to try and speed run it   speed running is the challenge of finishing a 
video game as fast as possible and if you're not   aware of this that it's super popular there are 
videos all over youtube streams on twitch people   love watching people finish games incredibly 
quickly because it involves a lot of skill   now to speed run minecraft 116 players normally 
start by collecting useful items in the overworld   traditionally done by finding a village that's the 
fastest way to obtain a number of key resources   they then head to the nether which is a different 
dimension by traveling through a nether portal   in a speed run that requires getting water 
from a river and lava from a lava lake   don't try to understand the logic just go with it 
once they're in the nether players can barter gold   that they've mined with piglen who will give them 
different items some of which will be ender pearls   the players then have to find a nether fortress 
where they can kill blazers and blazers will   sometimes when they die drop a blaze rod the ender 
pearls and the blaze rods means the player can now   activate yet another portal which will get them 
through to pretty much the end of the game they   pop out there's a dragon they've got to kill an 
exit portal and then that's done the credits roll   and the challenge of speed running is just to find 
the fastest way to do a certain combination of all   these different things to get to the end of the 
game as quickly as possible and traditionally   i tend to watch speed runs of classic games things 
like super mario brothers where yes there's some   luck like there's some randomness in the game but 
it's mostly skill i mean even things like mike   tyson's punch-out a very old game watching people 
hone the skill required to do that is absolutely   incredible in minecraft while there is obviously 
a lot of skill there's way more luck than you   get in a lot of other speed runs for example 
when trading with a piglet there are actually   17 different distinct items they might give you 
and inside the game code there's a table for the   weights of how likely each of these different 
items are if you want to get an ender pearl you   can see that's weighted 20 and 20 out of 420 gives 
you a probability of 4.728 ish roughly 5 so you've   got to do a lot of trades to get ender pearls and 
if you start putting gold ingots on the ground   a piglen will stand there and sequentially trade 
until they've used up all of the gold what you   can do little pro tip here is if you put them in 
a bit of a hole it will stop them from wandering   away when they're done you can then go and start a 
parallel series of trades with a different penguin   and if you get them all going at once eventually 
you should get enough ender pearls and in the six   live streams that dream did from october 2020 
across them there were 262 batters and so you   would expect on average 12 of those trades to 
result in ender pearls dream however got ender   pearls from 42 of their barters that's over three 
times the average blaze rods are a bit more simple   they occur fifty percent of the time you kill a 
blaze over the same six live streams dream killed   305 blazers which should give you 152 or 153 
blaze rods on average dream got 211. dream was   getting pretty lucky now that we know precisely 
how lucky dream was the next step is to calculate   what is the actual likelihood of someone being 
that lucky what is the probability that you get   ender pearls 42 times from 262 barters we can work 
that out using this the binomial formula i love it   it's such a good formula it gives you the exact 
probability for a specific number of successes   in here you put the probability of success you 
then raise it to the power of how many successes   you want and here's the probability of failure 
which is to the power of all the other times   when you don't want a success and the term at the 
front that's the choose function which compensates   for the number of different ways you can arrange 
where the successes are so like in this case we   don't care when people get the end of pearls we 
just care how many they get using that formula   we can fill in a whole table to give you the 
probability that you will get any number of   successful batters resulting in ender pearls 
and we plot that you can see the most likely   is 12 up at 11.6 probability and this middle 
clump between 1 and 24 successful barters is 99.9   you are overwhelmingly likely to be in this 
part of the distribution whereas dream is at   42 all the way out here that has a probability of 
happening of 0.00 a bunch of zeros four although   it's slightly deceptive when you're looking this 
far out to just pick one specific value because   there's so many other nearby ones it could be so 
what we actually do is we look at the probability   of getting this or better which is the same number 
of zeros but then five six i'm actually going to   stop writing that as a percentage and just do 
it as a straight up number the probability is   5.6 times 10 to the negative 12. and sometimes 
it's useful to think of that in terms of odds   and so that is the probability of one in 1.8 times 
10 to the 11. we can now repeat the whole process   for blaze rods which have a 50 chance of happening 
each time you kill a blaze and the probability of   getting 211 or more blaze rods out of 305 kills is 
8.8 times 10 to the negative 12. also incredibly   small not dissimilar to the other one and that 
represents odds of 1 in 1.1 times 10 to the 11.   so there's one in 110 trillion very very unlikely 
and if we assume that these two probabilities are   independent the chance of them both happening we 
multiply them together and the overall probability   is 5.0 times 10 to the negative 23. that's a 1 
in 2 times 10 to the 22 chance a 2 with 22 zeros   after it getting a result as good or better 
than what dream got is vanishingly unlikely   but just the straight odds that's clearly not the 
whole story i mean you're watching me sit here   have arguably better luck than i have any right 
to have what are the odds of this happening is   this real have i faked it somehow well there's 
a lot of things you don't know how long have i   been sat here for where did this beard come from 
how can we compensate for all the unknowns outside   of the actual bit we're looking at and don't worry 
this is where more statistics and probability come   in and actually it's a good time to go to the very 
first segment of this video part one the attack   part one the attack it all kicked off when dream 
submitted one of their speed runs to speedrun.com   and it would have been at the time the fourth 
fastest speed run of this part of minecraft   in the world however the moderation team at 
speedrun.com were not convinced that dream   was using an original unaltered installation of 
minecraft they thought the luck indicated dream   must be cheating they had somehow changed 
the version of the game they were playing   and so they released a summary video that 
went through their investigation into the   mathematics of the probabilities in a nice kind of 
introductory level and they released a 29 page pdf   that went through it in i would say a rambly level 
of detail the starting point was some observations   from other speed runners that dream had had very 
good luck with the ender pearls and blaze rods   across six consecutive live streams in october 
2020 they then did the same calculation that we   did with the binomial distribution combined them 
the same way and got the 10 to the negative 23   probability that we previous saw but they didn't 
stop there in fact the vast majority of the paper   is dedicated to looking at how there could be some 
kind of bias in their findings they accounted for   four different ways that their investigation into 
this probability could be unfair against dream and   tried to compensate for all the unknown aspects 
of how dream could have got this lucky i we don't   have time in this video to go through all four of 
those so i'm going to look mainly at sampling bias   in stream selection this is the idea that if 
dream was doing a lot of different live streams   someone could have just maliciously picked the 
ones which made dream look the most guilty however   we can fix that with some mathematics as i will 
demonstrate with a coin flipping example let's say   i've uploaded a video to youtube of me flipping 
a coin a hundred times because i have i've done   that it's on my second channel you can check it 
out it's there in case you ever can't be bothered   flipping your own coin and i'm using a coin which 
is yellow on one side for heads and it's blue   for tails however let's say hypothetically some 
malicious actor has edited out just a run of 12   flips from the middle where i got 10 tails out 
of 12 times i flipped the coin and they're saying   that clearly the coin can't be fair if you do the 
binomial distribution on this there's only a 1.6   chance that you'd get 10 tails out of 12 flips or 
a 1.9 chance that you would get 10 or more tails   out of 12 flips clearly it can't be a fair coin if 
the chance of getting my results are so incredibly   small now you come along and you're not sure 
who's telling the truth here so you're going   to try and compensate for the fact that you know 
i did a hundred flips and let's say hypothetically   you can't find the original footage so yeah 
yeah i know matt flipped it a hundred times   and obviously this malicious actor has 
picked a run of flips with the smallest   probability of having occurred if the coin was 
fair like the the p value but there were loads   of other runs of flips they could have picked 
technically they could have picked any of the   individual flips there was a hundred of those to 
pick they could just cut one out they could have   picked any of the 99 pairs of flips they could 
have picked any of the 98 runs of three any of   the 97 runs of four all the way up in fact there 
are 5050 different possible consecutive runs of   flips this malicious actor could have picked now 
at this point to be honest you've got the general   idea if you're looking at some results you got to 
bear in mind that there were probably more results   which someone could have picked from and you've 
got to somehow factor that in the details of how   we do this get difficult to follow though because 
you're taking lots of inverses of other inverses   and you're rounding things up or down and there's 
no way you can pick this all up on the first pass   i'm gonna go through the details just so you get 
a flavor of it but don't panic to understand it   properly you'll have to pause the video here 
and go away and do some more reading that said   to give me the benefit of the doubt you're gonna 
work out what is the probability if you flip a   coin a hundred times if the coin is fair that 
there's a run in there somewhere out of any of   the 50 which is 1.9 percent likely to happen if 
you flip a fair coin or worse so you're giving   me every possible chance to show my innocence and 
to work that out so the probability would be one   minus the probability of that not happening just 
easier to work it out that way so uh the chance   of it not happening 0.981 you raise that to the 
power of 5050 and you subtract it off one and you   get one it's like a hundred percent but strictly 
speaking that's not the exact probability because   to multiply them together like we've effectively 
done by raising it to the power that assumes   each of the different potential runs are 
independent but they're not they're overlapping   some of the the coin flips from one sequence are 
also in a different sequence however if you were   to do it correctly you would always get this value 
or smaller so you've done the upper bound the   maximum possible value because you're giving 
me the benefit of the doubt and in this case   it is the maximum value it's 100 so you've not 
managed to prove that my coin must be biased   i'm exonerated i'm very happy and of fun fact 
the exact probability is actually 88.3 percent   so the rounding up took it a little bit higher in 
my favor they have done the same thing with dreams   results and if you take the probability of having 
the amount of luck that occurred on the trades   for ender pearls and instead of just being the 
six live streams from the sample if you expanded   out to all 11 that could have been picked and 
you do the same procedure the probability goes   up to a new upper bound of 8 times 10 to the 
negative 10. it's still vanishingly unlikely   and this is the number which is as much in 
dreams favor as possible by the way if you're   enjoying this video my book humble pie when math 
goes wrong in the real world has just come out   in paperback in the us and it's full of very 
similar stories so if you're enjoying this video   i guarantee you will enjoy the book as well 
i will have more details about how you can   get copies with a free signed gift and i'm 
doing a online talk at harvard bookstore   on the 4th of feb all of that at the end of the 
video now we need to move on both from humble pie   and from the accusations against dream because 
the pdf goes into incredible details about all   the other ways that they very carefully calculated 
and up abound in dreams favor and if i had one   criticism of their paper they go into a level of 
technical detail and language that's so dense it   feels almost deliberately obtuse i don't think 
it's malicious i just think they were so worried   about people going through their argument with a 
fine tooth cone that they overdid the technical   language and the details and i don't think it's 
amazing math communication unlike other things so   we'll put that aside for now and we'll move on to 
section two dreams response part two the response   dream responded with both a video of their own 
on their second channel and their own 19 page pdf   full of mathematics this was written by an 
anonymous astrophysicist who is apparently   an expert in astro statistics there you go they 
are based at an online science consulting company   who dream paid to write this mathematical report 
for them and before we get into any of the details   the one important thing to note is that they agree 
on the headline statistic the naive calculation   that the probability of getting those enderpeal 
trades and those blaze rods is a one in two times   10 to the 22 chance that's the hardcore maths 
no one is arguing that what everyone's arguing   is how you compensate for all the other unknowns 
how many live streams there are how many people   are playing the game or how many things from the 
game you could choose to analyze all of that is   where this lot of mathematical working out differs 
from what the mods on speedrun.com did and i'll be   honest i accused the previous paper being a bit 
of choose this one is basically it's maths chaff   like it's terms i recognize and calculations that 
i'm familiar with but the way it's put together   is not nonsensical but it's it's 
clearly just trying to pad together   enough maths that a surface reading of it gives 
some element of doubt a reasonable amount of doubt   that maybe dream genuinely got those results from 
a normal version of minecraft so i'll give you two   examples of what i mean first of all there's a lot 
of stuff in there which is true but you wonder why   they've put it in so here they show that you 
can change the expression from the original   paper you can rearrange it using a thing called 
the binomial approximation don't get me wrong   big fan but there's no reason why you would put 
that in the paper that's just a step you would do   when you're actually crunching the calculation 
it's nothing to do with the theory or the concepts   that they're trying to get across not only that 
but it's missing a closing bracket that is an   unforgivable sin in mathematics and certainly does 
not indicate that this was put together with care   and fact checking attention and here this number 
the actual odds come out to be about 1 in 6 300   that number is incorrect and this is within their 
own hypothetical situation they came up with   the idea that if you flip a coin 100 times what's 
the chance that you get 20 heads in a row and i'm   not the first person to point out that that number 
is wrong but as a expert in getting things wrong   i thought i should try and work out what they 
actually did incorrectly and i ran the simulations   myself and discovered they must have simulated 
it for heads and tails and then to compensate for   the fact that it's just heads they accidentally 
divided by two when they should have multiplied   by two and that's why they're out by a factor 
of four and it totally changes the thrust of   their argument because it moves what they claim is 
the correct answer from one side of approximation   to the other and it's just indicative of a lack 
of care and attention when putting together even   their own hypothetical examples i absolutely agree 
with their point that probability calculations are   hard often in stats there is not one right way 
to do something which is why they don't agree on   how to compensate for outside influences the only 
thing we agree on is this original stat and while   we're here a quick subtle side point they use the 
example of a lottery in terms of explaining that   unlikely things happen which i agree however their 
whole paper is bringing down the odds that dream   could have got these results on a fair version of 
minecraft down to 1 in 10 million but that's not   the raw stat that's still 2 times 10 to the 22 
this is already compensating for the fact that   there were lots of opportunities for this to occur 
it's not like the lottery if you compensate for   how many people actually buy lottery tickets the 
odds of someone winning the lottery at all is one   people win the lottery all the time and this one 
in 10 million figure is already compensating for   the fact that loads of people were doing a lot of 
speed runs and i don't like the fact that they're   flipping between the two i would say a little 
bit disingenuously i mean it just makes me sad i   know i started as a disinterested party but i can 
say of the two papers this one is by a long shot   the least convincing please don't come and brigade 
me dream stands i'm just going off the maths here   however there's a way around this i'm going to 
ignore all the compensation that both parties have   done and just take the agreed raw statistic of 1 
in 2 times 10 to the 22 and we will move forward   solely using that and to do this we need to 
take a detour via a much more analog game   when you roll two dice not all outcomes are equal 
a total of two is as unlikely as they come of the   36 different ways that two dice can land only 
one of them is snake eyes whereas of the other   36 different ways they can land a full six of them 
will give you a total of seven that is the most   common outcome you get when you roll two dice now 
before minecraft back in the day where games were   analog dice were a common source of randomness 
and so i thought we'll take a quick aside   to look at an equally spectacular world record 
from a much more old school game ah craps it's   a two dice game where you want to avoid rolling 
a seven i mean the rules are more complicated   than that but the short version is if you roll 
a seven you're out and the current world record   for the most consecutive roles in craps without 
getting a seven was set by patricia demero in 2009   when she rolled 154 consecutive non-sevens and the 
probability of not getting a 7 is 30 out of the 36   options to the power of 154 is a probability of 
6.4 times 10 to the negative 13. that is one in   1.5 times 10 to the 12. it is less likely than 
the run of ender pearl trades that dream god and   i actually looked this up when i was trying to 
find another improbable achievement in a game   to compare with what happened to dream and this is 
the most unlikely result i was able to come across   so the question now is did patricia cheat 
or is this legitimate to put it in context   the previous world record for craps was set 
20 years before that and it was a mere 118   rolls in a row without getting a 7 which is the 
probability of four point five times ten to the   negative ten one in two point two times ten to 
the nine now that that i find plausible you see   according to statistics from 2011 there are about 
three and a half thousand casinos in the world   i estimated they have an average of i don't 
know five craps tables each some would have   way more some would have far fewer you can 
get about six games of craps in per hour   on average i've decided the average casino was 
open for i don't know 12 hours a day some are open   24 7. some are only open occasionally and just 
to put it all together i decided to look at 10   years across that period of time my rough 
fairly conservative estimate is every decade   there are 4.7 times 10 to the 9 games of craps and 
that's twice as many as the 118 odds of one in 2.2   times 10 to the nine so i can totally believe it's 
about a once a decade occurrence now patricia's   that's like a thousand times less likely so that's 
like a one in ten chance of happening once a   century maybe my numbers were too conservative it 
could be more likely it's it's right on the edge   of being plausible like it's feasible but it's 
still very unlikely but of course we need to bear   in mind i didn't just set out looking into the 
odds of craps for no reason it was because of this   record that i was even looking at the game of crap 
there are loads of other games where something   unbelievable could have happened but hasn't 
so i decided to pick a different game roulette   and then look into the odds after i'd already 
selected the game and there were two world records   in roulette the world record for the most 
consecutive spins of the same color is 32   absolutely incredible that's a one in 1.1 times 10 
to the 10 occurrence and the world record for most   consecutive numbers uh the number 19 came up seven 
times in a row and that is a one in three times   ten to the nine odds event so they're all around 
10 to the 9 10 to the 10. and that seems to be the   ballpark for unlikely things happening in games of 
chance in casinos and patricia's incredible run at   craps was just the meta lucky it was the luckiest 
of the lucky ones and that's why i got pushed out   to something that was a one in 10 to the 12 chance 
of actually occurring now dreams odds with the   ender pearl trades was at the level of 10 to the 
11 so pretty much the same slightly more likely   but the thing is dream didn't just have that run 
of good luck they also had one in 10 to the 11   odds in terms of their blaze drops for comparison 
it's like if patricia had her world record 154   rolls and craps and then turned around and equaled 
the roulette world record of 32 consecutive spins   on the same color in fact the odds of patricia 
doing both of those at the same time is more   likely than what happened to dream what happened 
to patricia boggles the mind in terms of its odds   there's no way you would have two things like 
that happening at the same time so to try and   put dreams incredible luck in two unrelated parts 
of the game in context i'm going to introduce   a new unit in the field of probability introducing 
the 10 billion human second century the 10 billion   human second century is my attempt to put an 
extreme upper bound on the odds any one event   can have and still potentially occur as being done 
by humans so 100 years is equivalent to 3.15 times   10 to the 9 seconds yes a century is roughly pi 
billion seconds let's not get distracted by that   now even though it's amazing it's within half a 
percent we then multiply that by 10 billion humans   again we're rounding up to the maximum number 
of humans and this result 3 times 10 to the 19   means that if every single human 10 billion of us 
were all doing the same thing every single second   non-stop around the clock for a century that 
thing will have occurred 3 times 10 to the 19   times so if anything is plausibly going to happen 
as being done by a human it has to have odds below   that so if something takes more than a second to 
do it's odds would better be below 3 times 10 to   the 19. if something is not being done by all of 
10 billion humans the odds better be below that   if something's not being done constantly for 
a century it needs to be below 3 times 10 to   the 19. and i know when we were looking at things 
in casinos things that have occurred but are very   unlikely were around the 10 to the 9 10 to the 10 
region and the world record for craps at 10 to the   12 is like the extreme version that's way below 3 
times 10 to the 19 because it is a very very big   upper bound nothing that a human does will ever 
have odds worse than 1 in 3 times 10 to the 19.   and as a quick aside i'm not saying you can't ever 
do something which has more than 3 times 10 to   the 19 outcomes you could roll a 10-sided dice 20 
times you'd get a very long number which is bigger   than 10 to the 19. but that number is meaningless 
and this is an interesting nuance of probability   it's like prior knowledge it depends what you 
wanted to get if you want to get any number you   can do that if you get a number that has 
previously been agreed to be amazing and   what we're talking about in these situations are 
when there's something people want to achieve   and we're looking at the odds of that not the odds 
of getting anything that's the difference between   throwing a dart out of an airplane and it 
perfectly landing like miles down on the ground   bam right in the bull's-eye of a target versus 
just throwing a dart out of a plane letting it   land you land find the dart and then paint the 
target around it very different probabilities   same action different probabilities in the case 
of speed running minecraft it is agreed what   outcomes a lucky player wants to happen they 
want to get ender pearls as fast as possible   they want to get the blaze rods as quickly as 
they can and for dreams live streams they had   odds in the region of 2 times 10 to the 22 that is 
way above the 3 times 10 to a 19 10 billion human   second century so all the extra stuff that was 
put in the paper all the p hacking or the optimal   stopping the selection bias all fascinating and 
very important parts of statistics for normal   statistical investigations where you're trying 
to tease out subtle differences from stats but   when someone does something with odds of 2 times 
10 to the 22 way beyond like just a thousand times   bigger than the 10 billion human second century 
you don't have to worry about anything else that   is never gonna happen before my final verdict 
a couple last things to clear up yes i have   dismissed a lot of the mathematics and statistics 
in the two papers and that's partly because some   of it is terrible and partly because i think a lot 
of it isn't necessary i have focused solely on the   2 times 10 to the 22 odds that everyone agrees 
on because that's all you need you compare that   to the 10 billion human second century of 3 times 
10 to the 19. now i know not everyone is fluent   in scientific notation and orders of magnitude so 
i appreciate often i've habitually been rounding   or even dismissing those lead numbers because a 
lot of the time all you really care about is how   big the number at the top here is which is why 
i say that what dream did is a thousand times   more likely than this number because that is just 
three bigger at the top and when numbers are this   big but yes you could calculate it unnecessarily 
precisely in factory and leap years and the exact   human population and everything but the point is 
one number is much bigger than the other number   and this is the absolute upper bound you can't 
just think oh yeah but thousands of people are   playing the game and that makes up the difference 
no no what i'm saying is if every single human in   existence was doing a speed run of minecraft every 
single second around the clock every human doing   it for a century the odds are still you would 
never see a result anywhere near what dream   got we don't have to compensate for how many 
opportunities there are or how many people are   doing it that's all factored in if every human 
was doing nothing but speedrunning minecraft   there's still only a one in a thousand chance 
that you would get ish dreams results it's just   that ridiculous and when you compare it to the 
highest probability result i actually found in   any other game and that's the world record and 
craps the difference here that's a difference   of 10 orders of magnitude so dreams result is 
10 billion times less likely than the current   most unlikely thing i could find in any other game 
that has been officially recognized there was just   no way this happened which is not to say that 
i'm saying dream definitely cheated and the odds   are not the chance that dream didn't cheat all 
these odds are the chance you'd get that result   if the version of minecraft is exactly 
as we think it is and so all we can say   definitively is the version of minecraft is not 
the standard probabilities that we've been told   and other people have looked into the random 
number generators and the code and maybe there's   an issue with how the program works and maybe the 
blaze rods aren't separate to the ender pearls   because the program's going wrong somehow but 
i think if there was a more systematic problem   like that then you wouldn't have such an anomaly 
in only dreams speed runs but whatever the case   i'm not assigning guilt i'm just saying that 
definitively as a disinterested party i can   confirm these speed runs done by dream should not 
be included in the list of world records because   the version of minecraft they were played 
on does not match what we think it should be oh right so thank you so much for watching 
this ridiculous video all about feats of good   luck as i mentioned before the u.s edition 
of humble pie is out now it is the same as   all the other editions well it's the same as 
the other american one actually other than   more flexible and i have put an extra bit at the 
back i added all the stories which i wasn't able   to put in the book because they happened after i 
finished writing it so it's kind of the updated   verse the expansion pack version of humble pie and 
because i couldn't get to the us to sign copies   what i've done instead is i got out the 
old printed proof of the book when it was   being typeset and so some of these pages have my 
handwritten corrections on them some don't because   they were fine i have signed every single page 
if you order humble pie from harvard bookstore i   will link to it in the description below we will 
send one of those sign sheets for free to the   first 314 orders at least if we have spares we'll 
keep sending them out oh and they might come with   the book we might have to post them separately 
haven't worked out the logistics just be patient   if you order it quick enough we will 
get one to you and if you miss out   i mean at least you're supporting an independent 
bookstore because other massive online retailers   also sell humble pies so you know you 
can choose where you want to get it from   an extra vote for harvard bookstore though 
tomorrow night i'm doing a free online talk   for them so 4th of february i'll link to it in the 
description like i said totally free not limited   to 314 people you can come along you can ask me 
questions we'll hang out we'll talk about math   it'll be good fun but don't forget order quick 
to get a free signed sheet from the original   corrections proof now if you've been wondering 
how long i've been sat here filming to get the   incredible good luck as required by this video 
don't worry i have saved every single attempt   and i'm going to upload all of it hours of footage 
for my fantastic patreon supporters because this   this video just wouldn't be possible without them 
in fact when the whole minecraft controversy first   kicked off i thought you know what given people 
support me to make math videos and there's   suddenly a whole flood of young people who want 
to learn about statistics because of minecraft   i'm obliged to do a video and thanks to the 
fantastic patreon support not only was i able   to sit here until i got the video to work uh 
but oliver dunk has helped me out with all the   minecraft in the video uh alex genbash helped me 
with doing the editing ben sparks helped me put   together some normal distributions binomial and 
so there's a whole team of people and we can do it   because of your support and if you don't 
support me on patreon that's fine don't worry   uh i know not everyone can afford 
it if you're watching these videos   sharing them doing algorithm pleasing things 
that's hugely appreciated as well thank you so   much and hopefully this video has reached a 
new audience of people who've now realized   that they can go through stats themselves 
critically and occasionally they just bear   in mind that when they see something which 
seems too lucky to be true occasionally it is hey all right hey thanks for 
your help that was excellent   no worries all that wait a beard 
how long have you been filming for
