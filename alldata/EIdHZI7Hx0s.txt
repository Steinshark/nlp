ladies and gentlemen when Magnus Carlson plays chess we all watch we dissect we learn we laugh we cry if he loses we experience a wide range of emotions and in today's video I'm going to be covering several of the games that he played just a couple of days ago at the AI cup it's part of the Champions chess tour and it was an epic final match for we got to see multiple layers of magnus's chest personality we saw UPS we saw Downs it was a back and forth of fair and his opponent was Maxim Vash lra who is the famed accomplished Ultra successful uh French chess player and that's about all I have to say sit back relax and enjoy this one-way ticket to Oslo Norway um or Leon France and and I just want to say uh mvl has a great profile picture I don't know if you can see that uh that that is him on a shark Sensational Magnus begins with Pawn to E4 MV is a Sicilian Defense player and if there's an opening that he plays it is the nidorf and and you got to love this because mvl literally his middle name is naidorf like you can't make this stuff up his name is Maxim naidorf Vash gra that's not actually his name but Magnus goes directly into his point of strength which is amazing you love to see that first game we just go straight into his opening Magnus plays Bishop E3 now mvl plays this funny move Knight to G4 and many games here have actually gone back and forth white is like no I want to put my Bishop there and Black's like I want to make a draw and you uh but that doesn't happen in this game because after the Knight goes back Magnus plays F3 so Magnus plays the F3 knorf not the bishop to E3 knorf but he still puts his Bishop there and his Queen and this setup clearly shows that white is going to Castle Queens side which he will do in a moment first he plays Pawn to G4 this this F3 Pawn is kind of like a trampoline it's like a like a springboard for these pawns I can't draw arrows the pawns are going to go that way kicking out the Knight and potentially uh Landing in front of the king of it castles over here but mv's got plans of his own with B4 he stops Magnus from advancing with H6 Magnus castles long Knight moves to the center because you can't play F4 I take this you can't play G5 you can but then I would just take and you're not going to break through anyway successfully there Magnus plays Pawn to B3 temporarily slowing down the queen side and reroutes his Knight backwards via B2 very obscure stuff now mvl sensing the retreating sensing Magnus already down three and a half minutes plays D5 trying to take over the initiative Magnus attacks the knight in the center of the board mvl sacrifices the night ruining White's Pawn structure barreling into the position and now a very cool C collected Rook to G8 and this is one thing you got to love about about uh about Sicilian Defense players about you know maima in particular he's not afraid to part with material magnus's Knight is back here uh these pieces are all a bit loose and without pawns with with in White's position White's not going to be able to attack black black meanwhile has very potent and powerful and sexy attacking possibilities uh and uh well here we go and now in this position Magnus sacrifices his queen queen takes E4 look at that oh my goodness gives up the queen entirely grabs the bishop and this is hid various discovered attacking possibilities open in the future the Knight is going to come in as well so mvl decides to sack the queen back amazing he could have played Queen E7 but then Magnus would have gone Bishop to E2 and just slowly improved this position as this Knight stands in the territory and if you play Rook to d8 I got bad news I take this Pawn on and I come right back and I'm going to get that material so very difficult position mvl just says all right let's go to an end game I've got a rook you've got a knight and a bishop I've got an extra two pawns and uh if you know anything about Magnus Carlson you know this man in an endgame and it doesn't matter if it's uh theoretical doesn't matter if it's imbalanced he's going to find a way he gets the two Bishops versus The Rook which is a borderline winning Advantage it just comes down to the Pawns mvl advances his two F pawns mvl has three pass pawns every one of these pawns is eligible to become a queen but one is gone you can't play Rook h8 because I would play discovered check and then I would win your Rook so Rook G2 look at mvl bullying these Bishops but Magnus is too strong and he slowly methodically removes all of mv's Pawns and just these remain and they're just not good enough F2 a square away from queening Bishop C3 check rook centralizes and Magnus is ready to give up his bishop and get that pawn if you go here after take take Rook e four three pawns are more than enough to win this end game for white so in this position we have Rook E1 and Magnus as always doing it in style the bishop is going to stop the pawns Rook C4 sacrifices this and he takes an mvl resigns just in the nick of time Pawn is about to Queen this Pawn is about to Queen you have to play Rook to E2 I push by the time you bring your king C7 King G2 it's over and Magnus wins an incredible first game sacrificing his Queen sending it down into a super imbalanced endgame Vintage magnesian School of Chess oh I have a back cramp you ever you ever sleep badly and like your whole body just is sore oh terrible but but this is not going to be a video where Magnus just steamrolls his opponent this is going to be a video where his opponent Fights Back Maxim came to play he was not going to get blown out in three four games he came to play Magnus plays a tyon of Sicilian a four Knight Sicilian with Knight F6 and Knight C6 Maxim plays take plays E5 and puts the Knight on D6 and says all right I have two Bishops I have a starting setup let's go Magnus do your worst Magnus plays Pawn to C5 activating his light squared Bishop Maxim kicks the Knight out of the center of the board and plays Pawn to A3 throwing it backwards now Bishop to E3 targets the C5 Pawn Magnus counterattacks the pawn on B2 because if you take the side side over here is going to get weak let's defend that Magnus eyeing it up again Maxim calls the bluff says I don't believe you Bishop A8 opening up the pressure over here sealing it shut with Bishop to B4 now Queen E5 check played by Magnus Carlson hitting all sorts of things but Bishop E2 he grabs the bishop he plays Bishop takes G2 stopping mvl from castling Rook G1 is nice but you know what else is nice Rook to A5 utilizing that cluster of Pawns that Magnus allowed to happen C5 looking mighty juicy B5 taking marching the pawns through and then I come back for the bishop Bishop F3 with pressure here but all it is is pressure because Rook takes G7 this is crazy this Pawn is ceiling shut the king's Escape off the back rank there's pressure on all the pawns the position is super complicated and mvls down nearly 5 minutes on the clock Bishop E2 Queen B1 check and it looks like Magnus is going to go to town on these pawns Queen takes B2 I mean my goodness it is looking really really nice Rook to G5 what a move by mvl that's mate that is not an exaggeration that is a mate and the King cannot Castle so in this position Queen takes B4 check played by Magnus the king slides out to safety another Pawn Falls he has won all of Maxim's pawns Maxim is down two pawns rook f8 and in this position Maxim finds a move that completely turns the game around it look looks like white has to go here but then Queen E4 hits this and this that was magnus's idea and it looks like there is no way into this King well in this position Maxim sacrificed The Rook Rook takes F7 that is a wicked move are you kidding me if you take with the King this is mate it's just mate it's made on G7 on E7 and if you take with this Rook check here Queen H5 oh my God this is one of the most disrespectful Rook sacrifices I've ever seen in my life it's directly in magnus's face so Magnus goes here Rook gg7 he still doesn't move the Rook check and now he has to lose the queen to not get mated this is now the position what a ridiculous end game this Pawn that landed there on move 10 is still the anchor of white position and it is impossible to get rid of because I always have check and I can go defend and I can sneak it on other sides check check check check check mvl giving many checks and now he picks up the D7 Pawn now it's it's now or never for Magnus he's either going to defend himself or he's going to lose he's losing all of his pawns he can't get that other one because it's going to be checked no matter what and at some point mvl is going to start moving his pawns as well but here comes Magnus oh my goodness bolting down the board mvl with 50 seconds on the clock the pawn is a square away from queening Queen B7 check King to A4 Queen to B2 and in this position something insane happened in this position Magnus Carlson needed to play A1 because he would have deflected the queen and the King would have ran to safety instead he went here and now the king marched forward threatening the rook and threatening mate Magnus Carlson missed Checkmate in one in this position magnus's Rook is hanging and that's the Checkmate so he played Rook to B6 with the idea if King takes Rook B8 check and if Queen takes Rook C8 check and A1 Queen potentially in the future but instead Queen takes A2 with two minutes nearly on the clock Magnus must have realized at this point that King C5 is losing his original idea had been to probably play Rook to B6 but that's mate an MV has just struck back wow that is absolutely insane the white king and White Queen hunt down the king to the edge of the board stop the pass pawn and queen A2 is Checkmate it's all square so we keep moving now the way it works is the Players uh play a final in a double elimination they play a final Magnus Carlson won the first time they played Maxim went to the losers bracket the constellation bracket he won it so he got back into a grand final match versus Magnus so all Magnus has to do is bury mvl for a second time and he is going to win the entire thing here we go Maxim Queen's Gambit accepted ooh interesting and he plays a very solid line Magnus and this is one of the main lines with e 6 A6 and pawn to C5 plays A4 it's a big move it it stops B5 but it gives up the B4 square and you best believe that at a certain moment here comes the Black Knight to the B4 Square the bishop is going to go to B7 and that D5 square is going to be very much logged down Magnus takes on F6 removing the knight from existence and plays Rook A3 with a very simple idea he just wants to Checkmate his opponent he's going to put his Rook over there now MV gives up a pawn pawn to B5 it's a big move Pawn to B5 but everything in White's position is designed to stop that take take Bishop takes Queen D5 mate is threatened why would you threaten mate if Rook G3 is possible defending mate and counterattacking your king clearly Magnus didn't like this move because he didn't play it I don't know why he didn't like it and I'm not going to Instagram message him about it Knight F3 Rook C8 take take so Maxim is just down a PA like a pure Pawn Magnus just has this Pawn now Magnus is going to demonstrate how to overtake his opponent from this position and win the game Bishop D2 Queen F1 let's enter the magnesian school of Chess Bishop A4 he forces a rook trade couple of moves later removes that from the game and goes to this end game and plays Bishop to D6 take and take but MV does get this Pawn so it's 44 but Magnus definitely has the better chances because this is an outside pass Pawn B4 and now mag he's just going to do this and maybe play Bishop G Bishop G3 or Bishop C5 Maxim though fighting back brings his King walks the king to D7 anticipating the arrival of the B Pawn Bishop B4 but check King D6 wait a minute what's Happening Here the king's touching the pawn suddenly you start realizing Maxim has outplayed Magnus for a second game Magnus at this point has to just bail out I don't even know how to bail out you've got to probably lose the B Pawn keep the bishop and try to draw this end game with a bad cluster but Magnus goes here Chucks the F2 pawn and plays F5 he's trying to mobilize he's trying to to simplify the game down to a draw by force but he's down two pawns Bishop C3 and his King infiltrates gets to F7 But Here Comes Maxim you can win all of my pawns But Here Comes Maxim Bishop B6 Bishop G5 and the way that black is going to try to win this is to get this bishop off of this diagonal Magnus blocks the king arrives now if the bishop goes out that way to this diagonal the Bishop seals it off so The Bishop's got to go here but now the bishop is deflected and if Bishop to H4 which still obviously can claim a draw then Maxim will win uh by bringing the bishop around he's going to play the bishop to E1 and then we're going to get out of there and then he's going to promote so something like Bishop here King G6 Bishop E1 and that's the end of the game it's the end of the game because the second the bishop Sid steps F2 Bishop D2 and you can comfortably say here my friends Maxim just beat the best endgame player in the world down upon in an endgame Magnus just completely underestimated the defenses uh you know he could have played Knight E5 but the opposite colored Bishop endgame is a draw which is why he didn't do this he just didn't want to go to the opposite colored Bishop endgame which makes a lot of sense so instead he went to the same colored Bishop endgame trying to win it in you know equal Style no with by pawns but he lost straight up lost so Maxim now is winning the Grand Final but you know that's not the end of Magnus Magnus Magnus goes back to a queen's gamb but accepted and this was a crazy game uh mvl allowed Magnus to have a fat boy Center over here trading off his Knight look at this position I mean just visually White's position is stunning big Center well supported black has a weird cluster on the queen side that can be exploited potentially with A4 and and these types of things and that's exactly what Magnus does and he puts that big Pawn in the center sealing out the light squired Bishop F4 oh my goodness the position literally cannot look any better you put the bishop here you put the queen here you get the Rook lift to H3 Knight E4 Knight D6 is a million doll Knight Knight G5 is a million dooll Knight Maxim plays F5 and Magnus just marches him down the board I mean he goes strickling out of on him just walking him down in the octagon and uh Black's position is in a world of trouble here you knew that Magnus was going to come alive at some point you knew that he's not going to be losing these games uh back to back needed some uh hydration got a little liquid IV in here as well some electrolytes you know how it is um liquid IV holl boy we like those sponsors take take and take for those of you keenly watching you realize that mvl just won a pawn for those of you also keenly watching you know that doesn't mean anything because the Knight is struggling to get into the game white has a pass Pawn that's defended this bishop is stuck and uh Magnus just goes for it pawn to G4 just goes for it absolutely goes for it mvl Ducks under the shot oh my goodness look that is a that is a great move just giving up the pawn to activate the bishop just to give white a bit of a headache give him the pawn back Bishop takes D4 but that could come with its own headache but let's not forget Here Comes Black's Knight and and all of this and this and Knight to E6 and the position is still very complicated take take take take take the king is open oh my goodness Maxim on the ropes the king is about to be absolutely blood he doesn't even take back he plays Knight into D3 that is a ridiculous move trying to cut all the circulation of the white position Magnus says you can't even have my F Pawn now Magnus now has two pass pawns that are two and three squares away from promotion and they are all defending each other and they are all knocking on the door of the king oh what a masterful attacking game here comes mvl trying to throw some desperate things on the queen side Bishop G4 hits the queen but now we see why mvl opened up the diagonal because there's Checkmate but he doesn't get checkmated Magnus moves the bishop and slowly methodically Pawn to F5 and the game is over the game is over you take with a pawn I'm going to get him with my queen I'm going to zip around to the other side the bishop guards The Rook which is going to get the oh my goodness what a game you go back a couple of moves look at Magnus one minute versus like five he had two versus five and then he had one versus three and just perfectly executed game mvl captures and now a winning idea here is Queen G3 and Rook f five because for example if the black king goes to h8 uh you just start opening up this diagonal if the black king goes to F7 you actually zip around and if Rook G8 you have E6 check the king is deflected from the rook and if Queen takes you get in it's check and you win uh but Magnus is the best end game player of all time so he goes for an endgame but but is this end game winning I mean of course Magnus has check and two pass pawns but suddenly mvl is defending on the light squares he has a pass Pawn of his own and that pass Pawn is moving White's pawns are not moving and all of a sudden that pass Pawn is about to Queen Bishop B2 E6 and the players just absolutely obliterate each other's pawns and agree to a draw Magnus Carlson basically played an absolutely Flawless attacking game and right here sensed he couldn't find a win exactly with Queen G3 with the Rook counterplay so he decided to go for an endgame and I guess just in a moment of Madness grossly Mis evaluated it and black defended perfectly Maxim VRA will not go down he will not go down without a fight and he does not lose this game he saves this game we see Magnus saving games like this we don't see people saving games like this against Magnus and Magnus lost the final he lost the final now remember he won the F the first final so this is the this is the grand finale and now in double elimination format what happens is mvl won a match Magnus won a match they play a two- game mini match and that decides the whole thing so Maxim fights his way back gets revenge against Magnus but now it's time for Magnus to end this run we have yet another Queen's Gambit accepted DC the positions might all be fusing into one another please do not worry another one of these games where the big Center happens and uh my friends you are not going to have to wait for excit in this one because after Knight D4 Bishop C7 attacking his Queen you may realize that Queen is trapped you may also not be realizing what's even happening on the board because you're just watching and you're just enjoying the commentary and the banter and the memes and the dreams and the schemes uh but uh in this position if Magnus moves his Queen to E7 black will play Bishop takes E5 and also Rook E8 so Magnus sacrifices the queen he takes the bishop Bishop takes D6 Rook takes D6 and all of this has been played before as you can see Magnus is not thinking 15 minutes and 34 seconds on the clock he just gave up a queen for two Bishops that's the count Leon Beast is up three points of material but that's falling the king will be weak and Magnus will just simply have more pieces Pawn to C6 completely prevents black from developing anything and look at this position black has no moves this is this is magnesian right here Rook d8 is coming he's going to double up in a moment it's I mean the position is completely hopeless black can't move a single piece but it's been that type of match and Maxim has come to fight he is not just going to get steamrolled here by Magnus he is going to fight he has absolutely no respect whatsoever he plays Knight bd7 he says all right I can't move anything take my knight mag Magnus says yeah I I will now Knight takes D7 let's trade some pieces look at this we got everything staring at everything you trade too much I can't even play Rook D7 but I would play Queen C4 check you trade too much you're going to lose Queen is very powerful knight C6 just getting out of the way Bishop comes back now it's time for mvl Rook D1 pieces on the back rank King slides out of the way of the bishop Magnus just going for it look at this G4 I mean just how is maxim going to stop this attack three of his four pieces are stuck on the back rank the Knight patrols the Rooks the Knight can't move out this way the Bishops are powerful and staring at everything Maxim's just got to make moves he's also down six minutes on the clock Queen F6 Bishop D4 Maxim just takes on H4 he takes on H4 because desperate times call for desperate measures Bishop takes E6 is a ridiculous move because the Knight can't take the bishop because that's a fork so Maxim has to get away with his Queen but now the bishop goes to D5 visually look how absurd this position is maxus just has two Bishops for a queen but because he has so many pieces strength in numbers Maxim offers up a rook he offers up a rook because just just by getting another piece off of the position he has a chance but G5 is coming Magnus says I don't want the Rook G5 let's go and now mvl says you should have taken my Rook when you had a chance because you're leaving me with too many pieces Rook C8 Magnus plays Rook C6 but you see he spent nearly 3 minutes on that move he didn't like something take take H takes G5 couple of moves ago Magnus played this move G5 to open up Black's King but suddenly the king is open but one Rook for white is not going to cut it now here comes Black's second rook and you left my queen there you allowed the queen to get into the territory when you had all the pieces you were not scared but now I'm going to win your pawns let me tell you something right now strengthen numbers but not when those pieces are isolated on outskirts of the board Knight to D4 remember that pawn Magnus that you gave me remember that pawn now I'm using it against you I'm prying apart your position you can't take the bishop though because Rook H1 is mate ridiculous the bishop stops The Escape of the king queen H5 and then Rook H5 so Rook d8 Rook F1 we G2 Rook F5 now here comes Rook H5 Pawn to G6 Rook to F6 getting closer all the pawns have fallen and Magnus has no more anchors of pieces Knight F3 he brings the bishop back if you take I have Rook F7 but guess what so what the black king courageously marched es up to H5 and my friends this is absolutely maddening Magnus Carlson loses the Knight on F3 has to take the queen and Maxim is going to calmly push this pawn and slide back to stop Magnus from queening and that is exactly what happens Maxim Vash gra just defeats Magnus again again with the black pieces in an insane game leaving Magnus no choice but to save it in the final game of the match or will Maxim completely change The Narrative of this video and win it all Maxim plays into an open Sicilian plays C4 a maroi style formation puts all these pawns forward Magnus has to win with black Bishop E3 Knight C2 looking to trade some pieces because the less pieces you have the less winning chances you have and white wants to play E5 Queen D2 Rook E1 Magnus throws in the Knight forces a trade mvl seals the center the knights and the queen are now disconnected the bishop has opened up possibilities of sacrifice the Knight can't return home Knight E4 Knight D6 also a possibility the queen slides out of the way of the pin the Knight goes there Rook D1 looking to fight back let's trade off the knights and the Knight goes to the center Knight F5 looking to put the Knight on E3 Here Comes Rook F3 Maxim is ready with this and G4 just so you understand how close this game is to being over if Rook H3 and G4 happen uh Knight F6 check is also possible Here pawn takes and queen H5 but just to like G4 and all of this is just absolutely brutal so we have take take and Knight E3 and in this position not needing to do anything overly complicated Maxim says it's time to bury I was going to say the world champion but he's not but the best player probably of all time Bishop takes H7 check the Greek gift Sacrifice from a Frenchman to a Norwegian Rook H3 check the elevator door slides open and out comes the queen that's mate now it's a 50/50 Magnus has to move his f- Pawn to get an Escape Route for his King you're seeing minus two because according to stockfish one of these moves is winning and one of them is a draw Magnus Carlson spends 5 seconds on this move and plays the wrong one apparently you had to play F6 Queen H7 King F7 and now if Rook H6 there is I mean there's a multitude of moves but Rook takes here is actually just winning uh Knight takes Rook is actually just winning because for example Rook F6 King E8 Queen G6 you have Rook F7 apparently also if F6 King H7 Rook G3 threatening this the Knight can come back to F5 this is the key idea defending this and this but when you play F5 you now no longer have this move so after this this Rook G3 there is Rook G8 but Rook H6 black can now no longer take this originally there was a Pawn on F6 which stopped the the attack over here but now you cannot go there because of this friendly reminder when the pawn was on F6 check here Rook H6 Knight D1 there is no mate Magnus had to play the right move he had five seconds spent on this moment one is probably winning and the other my friends not good enough Pawn to F5 played the attack Roars forward and now Magnus can't take this or this Rook F6 is a threat Queen G6 is a threat you can't stop the attack the game will end in a draw and yet Magnus takes this pawn and the game does not end in a draw because Maxim finds check here and he doesn't take anything else with a check Queen takes G7 he threatens mate and if the Rook takes Pawn takes mate and a queen is coming two Z Maxim VRA just just shocked the absolute world of Chess came back in a final against Magnus Carlson and didn't beat him once but beat him twice he won two matches against Magnus Carlson in one day and he wins the AI cup and he qualifies to the grand finale in Toronto Canada which will happen in December more on that later incredible incredible stuff not always what you expect in a Magnus video someone came to fight today and his name was Maxim naidorf vagra have a good weekend if you're watching this on Saturday and get out of here
