today is a very special day that's right I get to show you my new rack it's big it's hot and I just wanna stuff my face in it that's in the script wow you know what else is in the script are you lagging out while Gaming use glassware to see what apps are wasting your bandwidth and causing your games to lag get 25 off at the link in the video description [Music] do we even have a knife uh yes oh no now that's enough it's conveniently line of size oh wow actually you know that's ladybug power right there wait no Jake we screwed it up what do not break down skid well like at a warehouse you haven't seen this thing yet no I haven't this is uh hopefully maybe one of the best things I've ever done in my life big shout out to Rack Solutions big shout out to racksolutions.com for sending us this thing oh are you serious right now oh my God I thought it was covered in pink bubble wrap I was 100 sure that I was looking at like that esdc oh yeah or like pink or the blue or pink yeah this is extremely vibrant I sent them a sample of like cloth dye that I found online that was like the most hot pink I could find apparently the first time they painted it this is a new thing they've never painted a rack this color before they've never done this color before it didn't quite come out right so they've actually painted this rack twice oh my God it looks amazing oh yeah wow holy this is sick this finish is so nice it's made in the USA so they can you know have Hands-On with the quality control and they can do customization stuff like this also this thing is huge well some of us are getting work done yeah I'm sorry yeah I'm kind of a slacker way to be Jake ow no I chipped it how bad no disrespectful I know I want to tell I'm gonna tell them you're just a bad guy all right two Down Slacker what do you mean I've done three are you done three wait is this the back or is this the front oh God I don't know I guess this is the back now because you messed it up oh that's tight I have side cutters how are we gonna move this we could tilt it down yeah it should be fine yeah let's just tilt it off that way I don't think tilting this is a good idea this whole skid was 290 Pounds including this kid do you think you could deadlift 150 pounds I think it'll be okay I don't know if this is the correct orientation but um okay are you pushing oh no no I'm like just kind of letting you do are you going all the way down oh yeah okay all right Sugar We're Going Down Swinging oh it's pretty heavy oh look at the inside oh my God this is like you go to like a car show and you see that guy with just like the balled out engine compartment like you just had everything painted can you get lime green ethernet patch cables infinite cables can make anything God we are such shells they're all out now we just have to do the reverse the reverse wow these guys yeah this thing is really nice oh you did you mangled it you suck it's legitimately not visible and rack Solutions will send me a thing a touch-up paint anyway right okay so let's pick up this end put it on the floor and then we tilt it up here we go you can do it all by yourself right ah it's actually it's a really awkward height because it's kind of too low and this is kind of too high for me what you're saying is you should be taller right okay how you doing you're good you're good you're good you're good almost there buddy hey are you gonna let go at some point uh no okay let's just there wow all right here we go oh hold on what I think we overlooked something oh the stairs stairs well we can just put the cardboard down there I don't think the cardboard's gonna I want to try to lift it you wanna try it Yvonne can you help oh can we just tilt it down I mean it's got all this foam on it right like no you can't lift from there you gotta lift from the bottom I don't want to lift from the bottom you gotta lift from the bottom and use your legs whoa okay fine okay let's try it oh no I can't ow my foot oh I came down on my toes yeah oh wait why don't we just tilt it down and carry it horizontally up because then I can hold it better so just tip so I can tilt it towards you yeah yeah lift it over the steps yeah chill thing hold on foot it's very large drop it if you have to put it down put it down slowly okay oh yeah I went to stab my hand into one of the holes on the top to use it as a grip okay and I missed okay I've got this now okay oh I'm gonna hit the stairs okay um let's go back forward three two one oh no this is a bad angle hold on back it up just a touch yep oh that's good that's good okay it's resting on the foam on the top stair so now we're just gonna Teeter it up yeah we'll slide it because we can't put it down on the top because there's no foam here yeah okay we got this why didn't we bring a dolly just keep going if you can I'm gonna move this just it weighs like 20 pounds ew should we put something down here it's a lot of cardboard okay now ow my hands ouchy two inch Gap nice all right let's do it it's time to keep tilting lifting the rack okay is there any damage on that side are we good there's a nail embedded in the foam oh fawn how do you like my new rack oh my God yeah that's pretty tasty oh I don't know about that because there's a Ledge okay ah okay I'll brace it you want to tilt it towards me ow ow my finger you okay you're good you're good keep going okay because it's gonna go over the okay is it over oh yeah this was too easy oh too easy why'd you drop it be careful with that no no I'm not gonna scratch it again I would never scratch it twice come on I mean you suck either way but like wow oh it's gorgeous we should get like a car detailer to come and polish the side of it oh wow you know how bad you're gonna feel if you ever accidentally scratch this thing oh he almost just nailed the desk oh sorry oh no there's a tiny Den what oh no oh wow that's really we gotta get the paintless dent repair guy to come yeah I'm not too worried about that oh I love how this rack has dual panels are they locked right now that might be locked right now where's the keys let's just unlock everything and then lose those keys because we're never gonna use them yeah pretty much oh it's grounded door too yeah that's not really going to matter because we're not going to ground the rack anyways hi the only thing that would be sicker is if these had retainers I was all like Jake don't worry I got the UPS I got the heavy stuff oh my God no you took the easy thing damn it it's a lithium ion UPS it weighs like nothing wow actually the way that the two spools of wire come in there's two holes in the top of the rack oh it's almost like perfect naturally the first thing we're gonna install is the UPS now normally the reason for doing that would be because UPS's with their lead acid batteries are extremely heavy and you want to build up your rack from bottom to top so that it doesn't end up top heavy and accidentally tilt over or whatever but this is the Eaton 9px which we had on hand from a sponsor spot we actually did for it recently the main benefit aside from these lithium-based batteries being look at this way lighter wow is that they have a service lifetime of Eaton claims about 10 years I wouldn't be replacing this thing for a freaking decade the thing is this puppy is only rated for around 1350 watts of power delivery and if we actually move all the systems in the house in here in addition to servers and networking gear we're going to be well in excess of that so this is going to be the first thing we install and hopefully these are rails how's that they're rails okay good okay you ready to stuff your rack this is gonna look horrible and no no amazing at the same time everyone will agree this is going to look amazing even the wife oh yeah well I'm not going to ask her I'm just gonna assume her answer oh you're rocking the paint oh no wait wait hold on I just lift up that side I'm trying oh rest in peace paint all right okay it's in that was easy wow oh it's so cute this is the cutest little UPS it is eye searing and let's uh it's a nice rack man also maybe don't lose these Keys hey it looks so out of place in this room oh there goes our light what uh BMS communication lost can't talk to the battery management system um hello here oh oh there you go I think the screen you can spin it if it's upside down too oh hey there we go oh I get it okay cool so yeah this is there we go um all right I'm giving it gas yeah I wonder if they what does it say BMS calm lost click okay this is a lot of unify stuff where does it all go on the unified Design Center there's like a rack design tool so I laid it out in there already so I'll show you that yeah holy bananas that is a lot of unified gear hey thanks ubiquity yeah I had no idea they were sent to call this over what the heck well we need a 10 gig and they have new 10 gig switches so I don't need 10 gig what do you mean I mean I want 10 . you know they have a 25 gig coming out really so I looked up a couple people's other designs and it seems like the best way to do it is have the patch panel right above the switch okay and then you can just patch in with little cables that's it so we just got to make sure the contractor actually puts the right things into the right patch panel yes oh give me those cage nuts I really want to try this I've been waiting I've been waiting like months to try this thing you want these nuts what if this just sucks I know right we've hyped it so much now I believe in you rack Solutions okay so you just put the cage not in there oh it holds it look at that oh yeah oh God did I bend the tool what the you know it might actually just be these ubiquity cage nuts They Don't Really squish it doesn't work I was reefing on her pretty hard there what if I let me just do one test like ah okay tried well we're putting them in by hand there's gonna be some data center guy here that's just sitting here laughing at us all right oh that really did shoot at my finger only you had the LTT storage screwdriver I do I need to have this other screwdriver with a flat head you cannot have the LTT store screenshot I have this other screwdriver that has a flathead but that's not what I say well this doesn't look like rails no those are the power cables this is a power cable yeah so that box the Redundant power system it's a giant power supply basically got it I think it's an ATX connector is it 24 pins yeah you plug these boys in there you go and then you plug them into the back of all of your unify gear up to six of them per one of these units and it'll provide I mean how's the power redundant at that point so most like Enterprise rack mount switches servers whatever will have more than one power supply so that means if a power supply fails you still have power it also means you can unplug it and plug it into something else thinking hot swap but the important bit for us is just if a power supply inside one of these things dies it'll have a backup things we should have at the office that somehow ended up at Linus's house this one go right under it yeah perfect oh damn oh he dropped my nuts oh sorry you dropped your own though you get wrecked in addition to the magnet being super strong in the shaft we have a magnetic zit so if you need to reach into somewhere and grab something oh you can do it are you telling me your shaft has a strong magnet how strong that is the strongest shaft magnet look it's a useful feature it's one of those things where you don't need it until like you need it and you're real mad if you don't have it oh you suck at putting things oh shut up it's like so crooked what it doesn't matter yes it does it totally does it's ugly objectively doesn't matter objectively does because it looks ugly now I couldn't help noticing that in addition to a dream machine we've got one of the nvrs We're not gonna have just one other NVR we're gonna have two other nbrs I'll walk through what a dream machine normally does it acts as a router as well as a controller for the rest of your ubiquity gear and as an NVR or Network video recorder but what I'm assuming is that because we have so many cameras we can't just use a single single hard drive which is all that the dream machine has a bay for and that's why all of the cameras in this house or at least I think half of them are going to be 4K and then the rest of them are gonna be 1440p so you need both a lot of capacity and a lot of recording power when I originally spec this out I had two 48 Port patch panels but because we're gonna have two 24 Port 10 gig switches rather than 148 we're going to want to get to 24s and split it up so leave that one empty oh okay go to the next one oh oh this is what we need next 10 gig you know what I think the problem might just be that ubiquities rack nuts are kind of crappy that's what I was saying can this hold me oh my God I know but I need to be able to see a bit better suck I'm entirely convinced it's not a you know hubcat this is absolutely sick I love it can I have this group thank you you promised me then that I can have lime green patch cables oh my God this house is gonna have the most baller networking that's just not gonna be used for like literally months while you're waiting for permits and stuff why do you have to go there right now too real why would you do that why would you say that the Project's been delayed by like a total of I think five months now because of permits yeah thank you I love you so much that's why I live here just kidding the geography was convenient that's the only reason I'm supposed to be moved in now hopefully it's less than six months now you might think lioness why do you need 96 Network ports and the answer is because there's going to be somewhere between 60 and 70. oh you're just throwing screws at me thank you there's going to be somewhere between 60 and 70 network devices between all the computers in the house security cameras Wi-Fi access points and anything else that needs to be wired up to the rack with cat6a so we've got 48 ports of just regular 10 gig with these Enterprise xg's and then we've got another 48 ports of power over ethernet so that'll handle all the cameras I think there's 300 cameras or something 30 cameras and then eight access points so we'll actually be using 40 of those 48 ports for like active Poe devices because they have that power I don't know probably uh rack shake brings all the boys to the oh no yeah I don't really think I need this many hard drives for the NBR well you can put lower cap ones okay maybe yeah these are not good come on visiting okay here we go oh wow hey it's on did you plug in the RPS too oh yeah you did okay so can you stick it through the hole yes very gently oh god oh no oh who's ruining it now me this is not a cable you can just clean with your shirt no wow I don't see a light down anymore did you kink it or something look at this twist tie why is it such a huge twist tie I'm gonna have to twist this like 20 times we got fail really I'm just kidding oh you piece of crap Internet connected well that was easy look at this shows up right away unify Network app I was already logged in because I have unified crap at home oh are you logged in the right one yeah yeah yeah yeah okay uh new console found dream machine pro not here um you're not my mom you're dead now I don't know why it says distance not near it's talking about like Bluetooth distance like yeah but I was like yeah I was right there through a metal rack I don't know I don't know sure whatever I'm gonna call this house of Dreams because it will never be a reality thank you I log in and it immediately starts doing an internet speed test loving that Telus pure fiber I've had a lot of bad experiences with Telus don't consider this an endorsement but their pure fiber is really fast man look at that it's perfect yeah so I guess we better oh yeah okay you are connecting other stuff to it already yeah look at you go with the 10 gig adapters so these ports actually are technically 25 gig but what I found out is if one of these is set to 25 they both have to be so then we can't do a 10 gig between these two if this one's 25 this is so sick I know right I'm so excited I'm really a toucher I guess it's time to time to ditch the poe injector we can just plug the access point in directly oh buddy look at this oh yeah look at how mint this tucks in here everything is great ow House of Dreams is that what you called it yeah because that's never going to be real I see yeah I'll change it to House of reality when I move in at home yeah screen what do you mean that's the whole point oh we can set these to Pink oh it changes them all what that's awesome that is some nerdy nerdishes right there and some guy spent like a week on that the NVR and NVR Pro both showed up okay wait don't don't adopt it yet no no no I clicked the button I'm sorry did it let you adopt them both at the same time uh no I think it's one at a time which one are you doing right now uh the pro I got this I'm adopting the other one now hey Linus what's up you're adopted so you're not my real dad is what you're saying I'm not your real dad no no okay you don't have a dad this can be my daddy so I think this is everything we've got our redundant power supply our 48 Port switch our 24 Port switches the udm pro I know why the UPS isn't working why look at this I just did this while the UPS is on you see this connector right here it was disconnected before it's clearly not power it's like sensors but uh I plugged it into Networks I forgot this is quite a bit more complicated than just plugging this into the power leads and 24 volt transformer and there's a dongle that goes on it I don't think we're doing this today see you later buddy so the idle power draw of all this networking stuff is 0.2 kilowatts of 200 Watts what we're pulling 200 Watts yeah sitting here doing nothing yeah well there's there's a one AP it's a good thing for saving all that power on the lighting yeah Jake pulled about I think what 2 000 watts versus worth of incandescent lighting out of the living room each bulb 150 watts replace them all with LED and probably went from 2 000 Watts down to maybe 200. yeah let's see what the Wi-Fi is like 250. this AP is also very directional so 350 360. that's directionality holy the good news is they will be mounted properly on the ceiling the way we showed you in that video which you should go check
