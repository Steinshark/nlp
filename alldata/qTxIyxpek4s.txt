ladies and gentlemen it happened again welcome back to the Tata steel chess tournament 20124 this is the round number six recap we're at the halfway point of the 13 round Festival we've got some of the biggest chess names in the world competing yet we also have some of the biggest chess names in the world not competing and yet here you are tuning in for these ring camps which is a good thing which is a good thing and I will lead you through uh I will lead you through all of these incredible games and story lines it happened again I've got amazing games for you today then I will give you the standings update I hope you all have a great Friday and if you're watching this not on a Friday I hope you just have a great day regardless we are kicking things off in the Challenger section today then we will go to Hans nean second then we've got Ali Resa fuja third we have got an amazing lineup of games today uh here we go elen robers as I think you have all told me at this point is how to say her name yesterday defeated Hans Neeman she went 0 and4 to start the event and then beat a 2700 Mustafa Yas from Turkey starts with Knight F3 and as early as the fifth move it is clear what we are doing we are playing a Kings Indian defense Main Line black will now choose the setup E5 castles and now Elina instead of playing Knight C6 or Knight bd7 or any Main Line plays B6 which is a move that I have never seen in my life literally have never seen anybody play like this cuz normally the bishop doesn't really go out like it supports an advancement or if it does go out it goes out here you trade you drop the night back B6 white plays Rook E1 he spends 17 minutes after B6 so she really gets this man spooked she plays Rook to E1 because the thing is you don't know with white if you want to keep the tension and how to keep the tension you could commit the pawn to to D5 right so now Rook E1 Knight C6 clearly provoking this move which is what happens and now white plays the principal way which is B4 right like that's what you're supposed to do in the king's Indian you're supposed to take space on the queen side what black is supposed to do is put these Knights back and launch a counter offensive but she strikes back on the queen side now that's weird and the thing is for white if you lock the queen side if you don't have any more forward Mobility black will go here and you're dead like black will then go H6 and then black will go F5 and you will die Black's attack will destroy you if you can't strike back on the queen side so he takes uh she brings The Rook out and now he starts kind of adding more pressure to that Queen side right he's trying to expand play Knight B3 put pressure Elena plays F5 she's still in her prep she's up 30 minutes on the clock take the Knight comes out the knight's got back up the knights are swarming in it's a very back and forth game Rook A3 a useful move potentially and she's also uh the not not she he's also looking to go to that side of the board Knight H4 Elena just lining him up look at this look at this all on the king side Bishop D7 targets the pawn he now has to liquidate she plays Queen E8 now Mustafa takes over he's got a really strong initiative after C5 she really should not have allowed it now the now the position's quickly disintegrating she takes on e4 Rook E4 but he's got a great position it's a will this Pawn sneak through the sides are now getting lower on time as well right 13 minutes to make 13 moves CD very very very complicated position black has four pawns white has four pawns but black wins The Pawn on D5 now there are tons of open lines over there tons of open lines to the black king he moves his King out of the center she now centralizes her Queen and has a major advantage King slides out of the way as well both Kings have been tucked away because the sides are about to go to battle he takes on D6 she takes back that was an inaccuracy now Rook D1 is going to win the night back she blocks though and white is down a piece white is just down a piece right now he you got two Bishops versus Bishop Knight Knight the best move in this position is Queen D3 that is a crazy move and the point after Queen D3 is that if you trade the bishop hangs the Knight hangs and that's and that's that but instead of that with about 5 minutes on the clock Mustafa plays Bishop D3 and no E4 and suddenly the white position is falling apart he's got two minutes to make four moves and not lose on Time Queen F2 threatening mate The Rook stops IT Rook unpins itself oh my goodness the Knight can be taken two ways but Rook e w is mate Queen C3 H3 but now knight8 and black escapes she's escaped the Skirmish with an extra Knight and now it's just a matter of can she win this end game now if stockfish played this end game with white maybe it's a draw because two knights cannot beat a lone King it's impossible so knowing that all white needs to do is get rid of those two pawns and not lose a huge amount of material doing it what black needs to do is bring the right pieces up the board if you trade the Rooks right now if for example in this position you played uh Rook uh I don't know uh I'm I'm just going to say Knight C7 Rook A6 uh it's a draw it's you cannot win this position because I will trade off my Pawns so black cannot trade the Rooks but does black have enough Firepower she's going to do her damn best we are now deep into the 50s one Pawn has been traded this is the final remaining Pawn all Mustafa has to do is trade the Rooks and Sack the bishop for the pawn and it's a draw but she's not going to let that happen she's not going to she's not trading the Rooks she's targeting him she's swarming him with the Knights but how is he he's going to defend himself surely we have now crossed 60 moves here comes the black king uh-oh the pawn might be lost but you can't take it cuz I'm going to mate you Bishop D4 King D4 one Pawn remains this Pawn wins the game for Elena and if it's if it is uncapturable then she's going to then she's going to win but if he takes it it's going to be a draw she he she she blocks with Knight D5 we've now crossed 70 Moves he's just not fast enough but while she's playing defense how is she possibly going to win right Rook E5 King E3 is she winning or is it a draw she makes it to F1 apparently in this position he had to go Rook A4 and if King F1 he sacks the rook and it's a draw it's a draw because the pawns are too fast the pawns go and this king is is it just can't get back in time G6 Rook A8 King F5 you lose the pawn but the pawn Pro but this Pawn makes it Rook A4 might have been the final moment but he doesn't play it he plays here she sneaks in and now rookie one trades The Rook but the pawn Will Survive and she wins the end game after 70 Moves 80 moves and Elena robers just defeats a 2692 and a 2665 GM back to back blow the guns out put him back in the holster she just went from 0 and four to two out of six she's on a two- game winning streak against an average ELO of 2680 monster victories for her and both with the black pieces no yesterday she won with white she played E4 H okay I take that back I got too hyped doesn't matter she beat A6 2665 and 2692 and you didn't so you know and I got more games for you it happened again by the way neither did I just I'm included in that group Hans Neiman looking to bounce back from the game against Elena versus Mar Andrea Marzi who yesterday put a man in the hospital okay like they had an ambulance waiting outside of the playing hall for Hime Santos from Spain this one an E4 E5 an Italian Hans looking for Redemption Mar Andrea looking for momentum what the D5 if you look in the database this is such a rare move black always plays Bishop C5 Bishop E7 black develops and only then does black go here and frequently black doesn't even do that black plays like D6 D5 is such a committal move you have to be prepared so much to play like this and it it looks like a simple exchange but the meta of it is that white now gets a lot of pressure on the black position Hans castles Bishop B7 F6 now now you'll notice Hans spent four minutes that that means that he didn't quite remember all the notes F6 but now white can open up the center with D4 this looks completely deranged to play chess like this Knight B6 targeting the bishop now you could play Bishop B5 or Bishop B3 Hans goes here all right he spends considerable amount of time he spends 10 minutes calculating this and then commits to this and black just castles now you might calculate this and go wait a minute take take that's a free Pawn you're right absolutely right take take take take take not only is it a free Pawn I could give you two but what about all these pieces like you can't win a chess game with one horse your horse can't just walk around and you expect to win you're not an equestrian okay you can't just hop around on a horse black will go Bishop B7 and then C5 and Knight A4 and very quickly you will realize you cannot touch your queen side like anything you touch you play B3 you hang a rook it won't happen in T Steel but it will happen in most other games so instead of that Hans thinks and plays H3 Mar Andrea Rook e 8 first move out of prep Rook E8 De Queen D1 I think at this point Hans spends 12 minutes and goes I don't I don't feel comfortable keeping the tension cuz I'm in my opponent's wheelhouse if I try to keep the tension here and I don't take he could keep the tension anyway and then he could just develop all his pieces it's actually very tough to play with white very tough not easy so H says you know what de all right we'll trade the Queens we'll do this I'll take what's the worst that can happen all right I'm not going to take the second Pawn CU Levy just showed in his recap in the future it's too dangerous Knight D3 Hans down 35 minutes on the clock we don't see this very often we don't see Hans out prepped and down 35 minutes on the clock he's usually out prepping and up 35 minutes on the clock and he's usually not on the defensive like this we saw a game he had to play against volak and I I showed that game a couple of months ago it was a Berlin was a weird defensive game and it's like not his style I mean look at this position black is a pawn down but if you ever talk about compensation one dude has four pieces just completely on the back Rank and his best move is this all right his best move is like to play a random flank move Knight C4 the pressure is building if white plays in a stable way he'll probably make a draw so he plays Knight D2 and marre just takes the Knight that might have not been the best transition he spent 20 minutes on Knight C4 Knight D2 he takes and now all of a sudden Hans is better right Hans is better but I think Mar Andrea just said you know what let me just get my Pawn back very simple I'll get my Pawn back I can't lose yeah I can't lose Rook B1 Bishop D4 now if anybody's better it's Hans so clearly the prep paid off but somehow he sat there and went maybe I don't know how to handle the position after the prep which is life yeah sometimes that happens like maybe black had to go A5 or Knight D5 and the way he played it Hans was able to develop and trade you don't want to give your opponent a chance to develop and trade when you're down a pawn and your only compensation is a lack of development by your opponent so now Hans plays King F1 F3 and now Hans is going to go to work he was worse the whole opening now is his time Rook B7 the position is basically playing itself he grabs the pawn on A7 Mar Andrea strikes with C4 the bishop attacks The Rook Hans moves it loses the pawn but he's got the A- Pawn so he pushes it black plays Rook E7 Hans offers a rook trade black says no Hans plays Rook B3 he's trying to win that pawn he's got he's got pass a PA very pleasant endgame Bishop A7 Rook B7 maybe we'll have a repetition no it's Hans nean he doesn't make pity draws King F7 Rook B3 but now black plays C5 what is going on I thought h had the position under good control but suddenly the guy's going to have two pass pawns uh uh-oh take take Rook B7 Black's defending so Black's defending and attacking and the king is ready to join the party on Stakes he plays a move with 30 seconds on the clock it's a losing move apparently he had to play Bishop to freaking C3 the idea of which is if you take you take the bishop off A7 I take take A7 and you lose cuz D2 King E2 and you can't stop my Pawn so Bishop C3 deflects the bishop and then you bring the king that was apparently the way the way Hans does it this way he traded too quickly he traded the Rooks too quickly and he wins a pawn but Black's king is too fast and I got news for you the bishop end game is completely lost so Han starts running his pawns but it's not fast enough Bishop goes back back to C5 Bishop D2 and marrea maritti out of nowhere wins this game against Hans Neeman Hans just can't he can't move anything Bishop G7 and he resigns he would have to lose all his pawns get his King out of the way King C2 that is absolutely insane Hans liema just lost two games in a row for the first [Music] time I mean I don't think he's lost two games in a row in a while and if he has maybe World rapid and Blitz but I'm talking classical that's not and marrea Mari just popped off absolutely popped off for two wins that is bananas I got more games for you Ali Resa feru you're looking for Redemption yesterday being taken down by the Women's World Champion that was a massive historic win for her he's playing we we this is a matchup of the two biggest what ifs in chess Wei ye was Ali Resa before Ali Resa was Ali Reza okay Ali Reza is the the the new generation story of Wei Wei was 2740 like 7 years ago so the the question was was he the next bright star of Chess and he's always been 2740 with a very interesting aggressive Dynamic playing style but his journey has never quite realized maybe the potential I mean he's still super young and anything is possible but these two guys broke the record for like youngest 2700 ever so we play a a a a death sentence of a variation this position is very very well known at top level if Ali Resa takes with Wei will take back on D4 so we get this and now we have a Queen's Gambit accepted type of position Bishop D3 and Wei attacks the queen side with B5 and a couple moves later DC Bishop C5 and black castles this is the position after 12 moves they've spent a lot of time to get here but it's relatively equal White NOW advances in the center simultaneously opening opening up the dark squ bishop and looking for E5 to remove the Knight as a defender of the king queen C7 trading and trying to bring the Rook both sides have traded DNC pawns so they don't have the DNC pawns it's going to be very much a battle on the other open squares of the board take take Queen B6 positions a draw um it's heading for a draw you can trade Queens aliv Resa plays Knight D4 instead and Wei plays Knight E5 aliv Resa moves his Bishop out of the way and safeguards his center with the move F3 Unstoppable Force immovable object you got the Rooks the knights are going to move everybody's going to trade and then here for some reason reason where he just like plays H5 he spends 10 minutes and goes you know what my position's very good I don't have to get in a rush I don't have to do it like I'm going to go here I can move a pawn same side and I'm going to control your dark squar ala now moves his King I mean you talk about a gangster move with all these PE King F2 is crazy the idea is very simple he wants to move his night he wants to take back with his King he wants his King to plug into the action H4 we's like my plan's good I'm controlling dark squares G5 Knight H5 different ideas in the future and Ali Resa realizes his plan he's like I'm going to bring my king in cuz we're going to the end game now my king gets a head start it's not clear if this is an asset or a liability for black and I don't think we's got an accountant on speed dial in in T Steel G5 he's just continuing with his plan Oliver has a takes takes removes the defender of the C5 Square which was an idea that was made possible with Knight B3 and the King walking up so everything he's doing is very Knight C5 it all ties together now A4 everything aliv has done from literally this point all tied together he was going to go here here King F2 Knight B3 take take put the Knight on C5 to put the bishop back pressure those pawns and then play A4 utilizing the Knight that he just put on the C5 Square I leave res saw like 10 moves into the future to get all of that on the board and now he's asking some really major questions of the black position Black's position is not very pleasant to defend not not Pleasant the only imbalance in this position is Black's overextended pawns which are in the line of sight of White's bishop and unlike these pawns which are in the line of sight of Black's Bishop these are a trio of Pawns and those are a Duo of Pawns and there's no way to Target the Integrity of them A4 is a nice way to Target that pawn structure which is what he does Knight takes Bishop takes takes takes way he Chucks the pawn he Chucks the pawn plays Knight G6 I don't know why he didn't play Rook B8 I guess just Rook C5 and he thought white was fine and now Ali resa is just going to push this end game and if wey can defend it God bless him and if he can he's going to lose Knight C3 King D2 Pawn's now three squares away from queening how are you going to defend yourself King D6 King walks over to B3 oliv's game is like is just flowing it's like water all right look at that King B4 Knight A4 every move precedes the other this structure has been intact since he played Bishop to like look how long eight this is this is move 37 20 moves ago Ali Resa went F3 this has not moved since then look the structure in the bishop have not moved take take take take Knight B5 then he comes back like they haven't moved the structure is just intact the rest of the position is being played Knight C6 check he has to move King again at some point he's going to have to move something right oh no Rook C2 no nothing at all nothing at all e takes F5 and in this position way you resigned he finally broke structure and he resigned because after takes he would go Rook C7 the king would go to A8 and you would win by king before King C5 maybe just king before King C5 and you just win B6 Rook here the only reason you cannot Rush with B6 in this position threatening Rook A7 mayate here I have Knight C6 I have some tricks maybe I can play Knight d8 I can go block but it it's a completely hopeless position and it's just incredible how from a relatively stable position this king move just like changed the whole game changed the trajectory of the entire game ol Resa wins again by the way Oli res is just destroying everybody except J and June yesterday he wanted to win a little bit too badly and he's he's doing a really nice job now I got two more games for you um Anish giri in the lead and in this game oh my goodness the stuff that he did he played Knight F3 and then he played already like this which is very rare at top level to see stuff like this H3 G3 trying to kick out the bishop and now we get a catalanes type of structure not exactly the same but Ali Resa plays this very very interesting early on idea night to E5 so he delays castling and instead what he does is he firmly plants the horse in the center of the board and combined with H3 is threatening to trap the bishop he's threatening to go G4 and F5 not right away if you play G4 black will go here if you play F5 it looks like you're winning but it's not so easy because I have take take take take take so I'm going to get at least two pawns and I have Bishop G3 if you Castle the evaluation is still about equal it it's not as clean as you would like but yes you are up a piece but that is that that is the point okay that is one of the points of playing like this which is nuts I mean Anisha has shown some really really nice preparation F4 castles and now param down about 35 minutes on the clock says you know what let's trade some pieces I might get my Bishop trapped uh Anish takes with the Knight and early on in the game just has a very very pleasant Edge he has a bishop for a knight tremendous pressure on Black's position that Pawn's going to die the Bishop's going to come here he's going to play you you can't hear outside but I can hear a really really loud whistle for some reason I uh got spooked Bishop E3 is going to put his Rooks here space Advantage Anish gir is looking to win yet another game in title steel T title steel title steel T Steel Queen D5 B3 preventing baram's knight from moving what an incredible position for for for I keep calling him Ali RZA for Anish giri que E6 that hits the pawn Anish plays King H2 and he is on Pace to win I mean he is just crashing through he's going to play A4 he's going to play A5 Pam's Dead He's also good threatening to just take right param fights back he's got to Anish takes the pawn param takes takes starts fighting back like this but Bishop D4 but there is Knight D7 Rook F2 and baram has surrounded the E5 pawn and it looks to have caught up in terms of equality in the position Rook F1 Queen E3 targeting Black's Queen side black says no B4 targeting Black's Queen side black takes on E5 Rook f8 Zips in param has a minute param has one minute to survive the next 14 moves it's move 27 plays Rook d8 take take Anish keeps building the pressure this is nuts param has chucked a bishop but is on the verge of winning it back now the only move here to keep Advantage is Queen E4 giving up the bishop and threatening to take on C6 Anish gets exactly that he's now a pawn up rook F2 now two minutes on the clock for Pam the only way not to lose right now is just to go for it just to throw pawns forward while white has not stabilized he does it an defense G5 sacrificing another Pawn now H4 the game is hanging like this param is about to lose it all and gir is going to win again he brings back the queen we have Rook to G8 now Anish finds a brilliant idea G6 the idea of G6 is that yes you can play HG and after HG Queen G3 Queen G3 King G3 Rook G6 white could try to play this end game he could try to play this end game forever but for some reason baram plays Queen D6 applying pressure to this and this Anish unpins himself and his idea is to force that endgame but in this position with his Rook hanging Anish giri has a winning move and the winning move is so hard to spot the winning move in this position is Queen F6 the point of Queen F6 is that you can't take because of this and if take my Rook gets out of the way and there is Rook G6 but then I go queen h8 king B7 Rook F7 King A6 Queen C8 King B5 Rook F5 King B4 A3 the critical move and Black's King either walks onto the a file and gets swarmed or continues walking and then it's just a ladder mate it's a ladder mate in the middle of a game King here Queen here anything that takes on the a file I will get you trapped in the corner Anish misses that and we go to an end game and this is actually just the draw uh White is able to advance the E Pawn for a little bit and he does but parham's Rook is too active and he just don't have enough pawns Parham does a nice job here and yes white is actually able to Queen the pawn he is able to Queen the pawn he's in fact going to do it right now he's he's going to go Queen the pawn but after King D7 you do queen the pawn but we just saw this in the same thing in Hans neeman's game uh not Hans neon's game uh the other game Mustafa versus uh uh Elina there was that the chance there to promote like this and run away with a pawn same exact thing here and this would have been a draw uh this this this would have been a draw in that game in this game it actually is a draw and Anish giri came so close but a draw is agreed he had a couple of moments but you got to give credit to Pam who did not go down I got one more game for you I've got Jordan van versus gukesh of India this one was a scotch Queen F6 a major sideline a a line that has not been seen in a million years I mean usually they play Knight F6 and Bishop C5 Queen F6 Queen G6 wow attacking the pawn in the center what the straight up looks like a 500 is playing by the way there is a threat it look I mean you'd be shocked there is a threat the the idea is is kind of to go here it doesn't quite work right now but the point is Queen G3 and there is this but it wouldn't work in this position cuz apparently Knight D5 and Bishop F4 is like winning for white but you know that's what you're looking you're looking at all this stuff over here and yeah my man Jordan van fores does not need two invitations to a party he goes F4 and he's ready to fight F5 GES plays Bishop D6 Bishop B4 he plays Queen F6 Queen G6 if there are children watching this they should stop and now he has to play Queen F6 again three out of his first nine moves moves have been made with the queen horrible two of his first 10 uh nine moves have been made with the bishop horrible and now he makes another bishop and queen move and he's a pawn up but he has to go back and Castle Jordan now has more space Bishop pair open lines of attack against gukesh all gukesh has is defense like Jordan is sending a reminder to him that like wherever you Castle I'm going to attack you you have no you have no chance so gash thinks and says okay no castling I'm just going to block myself up Queen E1 no castling I'm not going to I'm not going to commit my king I don't know I I don't know where you're going to go right my King's in the center you can't attack the center I have a blockade Jordan makes a waiting move okay gukesh plays A5 and then he plays Knight on B4 he's still not giving any information this is nuts so it's really difficult for Jordan he has to make moves that can simultaneously pressure every side Hees doesn't know where gcash is going to commit and don't forget Jordan sacrificed the pawn so this game of cat and mouse H6 G5 creating a blockade but now FG it's not really a blockade he's trying to trade the Queens he's not getting a queen trade instead of Queen F2 he could have played Queen E3 I don't know why he didn't Jordan is very much like a like he plays posum like he's giving up a bishop he's like oh no no I lost the pawn oh no but now I have a big attack but he didn't have to do that he could have played Queen E3 and not lost the Pawn instead he does lose a pawn and he's still attacking GES on all three sides of the board Rook G8 he stops mate Knight C5 and remember I mean GES still can't Castle he will get absolutely rolled and smoked if he castles in this position he he's not going to Castle anytime soon e takes D6 and now on move 28 gukesh castles Queens side and all of a sudden it becomes clear that White's attack is not the same as Black's attack gukesh arrives with his Rook using Jordan's Pawn as an umbrella Pawn hiding underneath it there is no mate it doesn't matter if Jordan takes on A5 by the way because Rook H4 somebody's attack is much more potent than the other Rook H4 Knight C5 the Knight dances out that way to take but also to redirect itself this way and uh yeah he's also got pawns on top of that Rook E3 we zip out just to capture a pawn not the best move by the way Knight to D3 and Rook F4 was much preferred by the computer to try to Target G2 but that's what happens in low time and this game just turns into absolute pandemonium both guys trying to mate each other it's like a piece collage both guys under 10 minutes to make the most critical moves of the game but in the shuffle gukesh finds a vicious Haymaker as everything looked to be defended in the white position he finds Bishop takes G2 a brutal punch that sends Jordan down to the canvas you cannot take the king because you walk into the G with the King because you walk into the G file and I play Queen takes Rook you cannot take with the with the queen because you remove the defense of this Rook so you have to go here but I still take because even though you didn't accept my offering you still walked onto the G file and now when you take I have this the discovered attack you will lose your queen you can play Knight E7 you can win my Rook back you can check me you can win my Rook back but when it's all said and done lukash emerges with not one not two but three extra pawns and that's it he clears out and in this position Jordan resigns cuz he's just going to have two pawns marched down the board and he could have played on but he decides he wants an early dinner uh and um not not worth fighting on in this position and GES wins a very very very very fun day we also had we had uh Max vadam taking down Alexander donchenko and these are your standings after six rounds Anish giri leads but it could have been a onepoint lead aliv Resa fua back to Four Points crazy because he even lost the game and he's just clear second Irwin Lami Dutch grandmas a trainer and training partner of Anish giri the big Dutch boys up top and uh half the tournament is in the books and Elena robers is up with two points I think it's not robers I think it's rubers I think technically it's rubers rubers I'm going to get this name right I promise I will she wins again Hans loses again Ali Reza is back gash on the board with a big dub things are heating up and T Steel half a tournament left you know what to do get out of here
