you want to be a good programmer and 
gain all this experience here's a secret   the only thing you really need to be a good 
programmer is of course look the part have a cool   desk set up have some code on the screen you'll 
get a job in no time right okay well that's not   really the case well not at all the case today 
we are going to be talking about how to gain   experience without experience it's one of those 
things where who came first the chicken or the egg   it's that bad thing is that the same yeah I think 
so where you are going on to apply to job postings   and you're really excited you've been teaching 
yourself how to code maybe you just graduate from   computer science or doing a career switch whatever 
the case is the first thing you will see when you   go and see these job postings for junior roles 
even is at least three years experience and you're   like how am I going to get experience without 
having a job to get experience this doesn't make   sense to me and this is something that I've seen 
over and over again I've experienced firsthand   and today I'm going to share with you how you can 
kind of trick the system by gaining experience to   Landing that job foreign is open source projects 
and it's not just any open source project I'm not   suggesting that you just go on GitHub find an open 
source project and start contributing if that was   that easy I wouldn't include this in the tips the 
reality is contributing to your first open source   project is very intimidating it took me way too 
long to actually make that first contribution   because I was so scared I was going to mess 
up I thought this community is going to judge   me I don't want to put myself out there what if I 
mess up the project or break something even though   you know in your heart of hearts that's really 
not going to happen all of these thoughts start   coming in your head I recently stumbled across 
this really cool repository that has open source   projects from pretty much all major languages 
and you can actually see within this repository   in specific languages what projects are beginner 
friendly so if you are making your first commit   ever what projects are best suited for you and I 
thought that was really cool let me show you okay   you can see I have on screen here this repository 
that I've been speaking about which is called   awesome for beginners and I'll link it down 
below now if you go through this you can see   table of contents here we have C C sharp C plus 
plus let's go down to JavaScript and then from   there what it will do is it will share with us all 
of the different projects in JavaScript now if I   scroll back to the top sorry if I'm making you 
dizzy if I scroll back to the top quickly here   you can see for if you are a maintainer of an open 
source project add the label first timers only to   your project and list it here so people can find 
it so this is a great way once again when you are   looking for an open source project that you can 
find okay I it's my first time contributing it has   a label first timers only or another kind of way 
of framing it this is the project for me and once   again just contributing to open source projects 
is not going to guarantee you get a job but what   it will do is really help you stand out there are 
so many people who are just fresh out of school or   learned how to code and are applying for jobs and 
they've never even contributed to an open source   project I know nowadays on resumes almost all of 
them anyways or the ones I'm looking looking at   always or job postings I should say always are 
asking for are you an open source contributor   what have you contributed to and it's hard with 
the lack of time to be contributing but even if   you just do a few projects or contribute to a few 
things and combine it with your learnings it's a   really great way to gain further experience all 
right fake it till you make it I hate this thing   but there is a lot of Truth in it when it comes to 
gaining experience to land your first programming   job or really any job now what do I mean fake 
it till you make it well I'll give you a real   world example I'll give you an example of how I 
did this when I was first starting out I needed   experience but I needed a job to get experience 
it was like this weird what comes first chicken   before the egg situation so in turn what I did 
is I started building projects for my friends   for my family even without their permission 
or them really wanting anything to be built   for example my dad he is he was a contractor he's 
retired now and he always he never had a website   you know this was during a time when it was word 
of mouth that's how he he got his business and I   said Dad you need a website so then I built a 
website which is I don't even have it anymore   thank goodness because it's so bad I think but 
it was a react uh react app I created for him   and what that did was to land my first job it 
showed that hey I didn't say that I built this   project for my dad I said hey this client needed 
a website for their construction site and this   is what I built and it's a really great a talking 
point B it shows you're taking initiative building   projects and see no one knows who it's for it 
could be you for your friends it could be for   a real client so you don't need to divulge all 
the details all right one of the best things one   of the best pieces of advice that I took and I'm 
going to give to you when I was first job hunting   for my first programming job specifically but 
this goes for really once again any role look   for startups look for companies who are earlier 
in their Beginnings whether it be at incubators or   online and what that will do is they're usually 
a little bit more flexible on your skill set   especially when you are starting out and why I 
was so grateful that I started with a startup   from my first company was a few things it got me 
in the door which was key other thing it did is I   gotta try out a lot of different things I gotta 
try out a lot of different skill sets and also   to different roles yes I first came in as a QA 
actually then from there I was you know getting in   the code base really working to become a developer 
and was able to transition pretty quickly into a   developer because they were a small company 
they were able to be flexible we didn't have   to go through all these crazy processes speaking 
of startups here are some job postings or some   platforms where you can look for your next job 
for a startup or at a startup okay check out the   website I have on screen here it was previously 
known as Angelus and they recently rebranded to   well found and why I like them it was one of 
the sites I actually used when I was first job   hunting for my first job and I've used them a 
lot since is they really focus on startups now   they have big companies as you can see here from 
doordash Pinterest these aren't startups anymore   but they do have a ton of startups as well and 
I really I mean they say right here over 130   000 remote and local startup jobs so of course 
I know a lot of you look for remote jobs this   is really helpful as well and for most of these 
jobs they do have the salaries as well which is   really key having different sites like this or 
even if you search up different sites such as   Tech startup job boards that's a really great way 
to find these sites that you can start then using   to apply on all right the last tip I really want 
to share with you is kind of a reality check which   is even if you are applying to a programming job 
or any technical role it's more than just coding   and this goes for experience too A lot of times 
people who are transitioning from one career to   another always ask me I'm going into this new 
industry with no experience no one's ever going   to hire me you have so much experience whether you 
are a student whether you are switching careers it   just might not be directly correlated but 
even in the role itself in programming if   you are not a good communicator team player 
Problem Solver you're going to fail working   for a company you might be the best the greatest 
programmer out there but if you don't have these   soft skills and are able to work with others I 
really doubt that you're going to have a very   successful career long term and I know that's a 
pretty bold statement to make but I really stand   by it I've seen some very talented programmers who 
aren't able to communicate and that's not because   they couldn't they just don't try they have an ego 
they let it get in the way so one of the biggest   things that I really want to highlight throughout 
this video of how to land your first programming   job or get experience when you don't have any 
is you do have experience and if you're looking   for courses on more soft skill related things it 
really depends what you're interested in I know   for me I took a lot of courses on udemy around 
soft skills with public speaking and also to   communication because it is so key but there's 
really a ton of different ones so I would say   focus on where your area of a weakness is but 
also to interest is because those combined can   be really powerful so as I mentioned for me that 
was definitely a public speaking but maybe for you   it's more the team building or the management 
aspect there's so many different areas of your   soft skills that you can build upon and also too 
you can put these on your resume alright I hope   you enjoyed this video and it gave you some good 
ideas and tips into how you can gain experience   there are so many other ways to gaining experience 
than the typical oh I need to have a nine to five   job and I hope these tips will really help you 
strategize wherever you are at in your career   and coding Journey leave in the comments any other
