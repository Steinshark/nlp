you know I I listen like I listen to the to the the poking and people saying like what what is going on like how does he try to connect how does he able to connect these things together I've been thinking a lot about the idea of transpersonal agency in terms of again trying to bridge the traditional categories like the angiology of the ancient world and the even just the hierarchy of gods or the hierarchy of principalities that you find in every single uh culture so the problem is is also in terms of the dismissive the dismissive tone is like it's like if I'm trying to bridge a way to help you understand in a in a in a more reasonable fashion something which exists in every culture you know for has existed in every culture for thousands of years it's it seems like this is a that should not unless you want to dismiss those cultures completely as being stupid for thousands of years despite let's say also having civilizations which will probably last longer than ours yes no it's like I don't know I think that it's it's probably a better a better uh effort rather to help to try to help us understand what they were doing if we can help people in our terms today help them help us understand at least a little bit what they were doing it seems like that's something that we that is worth the effort this is Jonathan Pedro welcome to the symbolic world [Applause] [Music] so hello everybody uh there are no introductions needed uh as you can see I'm here with uh my friend John dravaki who we've been having conversations now for several years uh this growing conversation and uh John is working on a a new video series called after Socrates and so I invited him here to talk about it kind of give us a sense of what it is he's trying to do and of course for certain we will wander into all kinds of interesting subjects at the same time so John thanks for coming uh it's a great pleasure uh to be here Jonathan I've uh we I don't think we have we talked since Thunder Bay I don't think I don't think so like a few emails and everything and so people we're planning another conference with people by the way just to say it's going to be in California probably I think in the spring at some point we haven't I don't think we we the dates are clear yet but it's coming so that that's great so John tell us a bit about what this prod this new project of yours is so this this is a project uh intended to be at the scale of Awakening for the meaning crisis but it'll only be 25 episodes not 50. um and so it's you know and really up the production value um and first I'll talk a little bit about the format and then I'll talk more a little bit about the content I'm trying to do a lot with the format really explore and experiment with it so like Awakening from the meaning crisis they'll be a lecture series a continual argument that builds but in addition there'll be I I give points to ponder and my intent is that people will ponder that individually but also perhaps that will help discussion groups um before discussion groups forming and then third for almost every episode not every single episode but I give a practice that people can engage in a meditative practice a contemplative practice it's a dialogical practice and it builds in order to give people a participatory and perspectival sense of what's being talked about um in the in the lecture so there there are these three things running and then I also break from it just being me um and about halfway through episodes 10 A and B um it's me with Christopher Master Pietro guy send stock and Taylor Barrett and then and we take everybody through like we do a demonstration and an enactment of you know of meditation uh contemplation some of the stuff I did at Thunder Bay and Beyond um and so there's that um and then also there's the series within the series which is I break from the monologue and Christopher Master Pietro and I do um Socrates and kirkegaard and the and the deep and important relationship between Socrates and kirkegaard and then that of course gives us a venue in which we can talk about the relationship between the socratic project and the Christian project and of course kirkegaard wrestled with that very profoundly and that's been done dialogically um and so uh really trying uh to uh play with this medium and open it up and really exemplify new possibilities for how it can afford people entering into deep discussion entering into a colleges of practices uh getting involved with other people Etc so that's that's the big sort of difference in the format I'm very very um very very happy because I had an amazing crew uh uh Chris altorf and his brother Casey and some other people are just doing amazing work on that so it'll look a lot better it'll sound a lot better and it won't just be me in a room with a white board um it it's a lot I'm trying to as much as possible exemplify what I'm talking about in the series but maybe I'll pause there in case so is there is there a public during the during the filming like do you have people there with you no we didn't do that but I'm hoping that like I said that there'll be that people will uh get engaged with it with other people I'm really trying to exemplify that encourage that um and give people a chance to bring I mean I'm trying to exemplify even in the discussion with Chris right trying to like you and I have been doing trying to bridge between these worlds that have typically been isolated even though we have tremendous resources for trying to bridge between them and again trying to do that in a dialogical fashion Chris is an Ardent uh I don't know what to call it the follower of kricker guard and you know Chris you know how eloquent yeah I had a discussion with him that was going to probably be up by the time this one goes up so yeah excellent that would be great so that that's the that's the the format of it the content is after Socrates in a bunch of ways I'm trying to I'm after Socrates in the sense of pursuing him and trying to understand him and all the people have who have tried to pursue him and understand him and then there's after Socrates in the sense of well who are these people that came after Socrates and so I'm trying to trace out the whole tradition the socratic tradition all the way through up to its culmination in um people like aragina and kuza I picked them for specific reasons I know you why isn't maximus in there or something like that but here's my reason for me two of the main themes uh are uh this interconnected of that reality is inherently dialectical in the platonic sense and aragina for me is really really clear on that um and then Nicholas of kuza is the corresponding uh learn learned ignorance and learned ignorance I think is the culmination of socrata of the socratic proposal that the wise person is the one who ultimately knows what they do not know but of course taken through this whole huge uh neoplatonic and then eventually Christian neoplatonic tradition and what I'm trying to do is help people I'm not claiming that this is what was going on in Socrates or the platonic dialogues although I'll make a lot of arguments around it but I'm trying to reverse engineer from this entire entire tradition what is right this whole Socratic platonic neoplatonic practice of dialectic into dialogues what I'm trying to reverse engineer it and make it plausible make it powerful make it practicable for people that's that's the content yeah so there so definitely it's not like because the first series you did was more like kind of The History of Thought through the lens uh and also explaining the the the Notions of relevance and all these kind of Concepts that you play with so here you're really dealing with basically taking someone by the hand and kind of saying like Okay so now let's do do this like this yeah exactly exactly uh now let's do this what would it be like to take this up as a way of life um and and to very responsibly put that way of life into deep conversation with other ways of life uh so you know I talked at the beginning about you know Socrates and Jesus and I I believe this is done very respectfully uh one of the people Casey is a Christian and so he said so I was right right and you know because they're both they both talk about being midwives helping give give birth and I you know and they're and there are Christians who have talked about that and I said so I want to pick up on that and then that's why it leads into you know what are the what's the Deep interconnections uh between the socratic way and the Christian way first in that you know culmination in aragina and Nicholas at kuza but also in this deep dialogue that I'm having with with Chris about Socrates and kirkegaard and how kirkegaard has really I think I really recommend people uh to really like the philosophical fragments where he's really wrestling about uh how did Chris put it he's a follower of Jesus but Socrates is his teacher right uh and so there's this real because you know he wrote his PhD thesis on Socrates and things like that right so so I'm really wanting to help explicate exemplify the socratic way and I'll I'll name that for that whole tradition introductory and then how it's also bound up with the Christian way how it's bound up with the cultivation of wisdom and I will I do bring some cogs eye in like how could you not right I bring it in along the way there's stuff around relevance realization stuff that's come up um about you know in the discussions I've had with you and with Paul uh the discussions I had with the Buddhist monks when I was at uh Maple um and things like that so um yeah it it represents really trying to turn this from theorizing into proposing how one could enter into a way of life so do you think that let's say because you talk about how for you this this process culminates in in Regina and Nicholas bakusa do you think that in the west people went away from what Socrates had brought yeah yeah I think so and this comes out at the very beginning of the series when I talk about sort of a a what's called new way and sometimes people a third way sometimes people also say third wave uh platonism which is this whole new recent scholarship around Plato um that's really taken off uh important figures like Gonzalez uh Drew Highland Kirkland uh ruchik a whole bunch of important Scholars who are really arguing um that and this follows in some way um from earlier points uh ah well I won't go into that but it it it's because that's just another yeah that what we we treated the the dialogical nature of Plato's philosophy as ornamental actually essential and Central um and and and crucially important and of course this ties in with my argument that the propositional the procedural the spectacle of the participatory are all bound up together and that dialectic into Dia logos um is um Central to that and I think we we've only recently in the last 20 or 30 years has this become the new way of really understanding Plato and correspondingly understanding Socrates because you can't pull them apart right yeah uh that I think affords us a profound recovery of what was really going on in that tradition and uh for people who are even like yourself who are a Christian right why why were Christians so deeply attracted to this way why did it matter so much to them why did they feel that they needed to enter into deep dialogue with it if you go into most well so let's change that if you went into the philosophy classes I went into about Plato and Socrates you would you wouldn't have any clue as to why do any why does anybody care about this other than some arcade arguments about whether or not there are universals and stuff like that and so very much trying to bring this back um and that's also part of a larger project which is this thing I've been talking about and I mentioned to you how I think Neil platonism can form like the courtyard of dialogue it could be the intellectual Silk Road because of its capacity to enter into deep reciprocal reconstruction with Christianity and Judaism and Islam and Buddhism Etc yeah and so I mean I'm curious about what you said in terms of the idea that the importance of the the dialogue format in terms of what it is that Plato was trying to to manifest because you're right usually the way it's presented to us and I remember in My Philosophy classes it's presented to us as if when it's talking to the protagonist and the other characters are basically reacting uh questioning um challenging Socrates and then Socrates is but he's the thread you have to follow and so you you see it more do you how do you see that like in terms of how the dialogue functions in the in how the dialogical aspect functions in the dialogues so it's very important to pay attention to the fact that many of the dialogues and and in aporia which really undermines the claim that what Socrates is doing is laying out an argument and he's got a conclusion that he's trying to get us to uh instead um so for example there'll be a dialogue on courage and you'll have two figures two generals I believe um and they'll they'll both be talking about courage and and then Socrates will do his thing he'll ask the questions and the the definitions don't hold they don't right and and and and and and and and if you just follow sort of the propositions and you don't pay attention to the drama it'll come to the conclusion oh well look it just ends in skepticism Socrates himself says I don't have a definition right pay attention to the drama the two generals first of all they represent different things and I'll come back to them in a sec the two generals say we want our sons to spend time with you Socrates because it was the whole question was where should we send our sons to be educated so they're more likely to become courageous so wait wait wait wait what's going on in this stock if you pay attention just to the propositions like skepticism but why if this argument just leads to a skeptical conclusion to the general say and this is a moment of Drama Oh but we want you to be the person that we send our sons to in order to learn courage and you realize oh Socrates is right he's exemplifying The Virtue and part of the exemplification is the point that it has to be exemplified it cannot be captured by statement but you don't see that if you don't follow the drama then you have to pay attention to the character of these two generals and what they this one the one General he all he just I know here's my intuition and Mer right and Socrates says challenges that first person intuition the other person the other person represents sort of third part Authority well the sophist taught me this and here's a definition and here's a definition and Socrates demolishes that so the first person and the SEC the third person are demolished and what's left is the value of the second person perspective the dialogical perspective you have to put the character the drama together with the argument to see what is actually happening and what is actually being conveyed did that make sense as no that makes sense I mean it's like because I think that I've also been very influenced by the way that I was taught Plato and so you know it also because of Plato's kind of hostility and Socrates is the hostility that existed between him and the playwright the hostility between between the way that that Plato represents the poets and all of these ideas the way in which you feel as if the the the um dramatic aspect of the of the dialogues would be accidental but I mean I I it would make I think you're forcing me to rethink to rethink the dialogues myself because because what you're describing makes a lot of sense like it makes a lot of sense in terms of of how it is that how it is that it can also help us explain sometimes why Plato why Socrates does certain things which are sometimes rather mysterious like in terms of of logic oh yeah yes yes exactly uh because he's often doing something for a pedagogical purpose than for a strictly logical connection to be made and and like we read I got the great pleasure to talk to him and we're going to talk again DC Schindler you know his book uh the Plato's critique of impure reason and he just lays out like even the structure of the Republic how Socrates goes down to Paris and then like like he's he's actually exemplifying going into the cave right and then coming out of the cave like there's all of this is going on then you have to pay attention because why is why why is Plato putting in that structure because Plato's trying to emphasize that the ascent and the return are both important to understand what Socrates and what wisdom are about we have tended to only emphasize the ascent but socrates's return into the depths of the cave is as important to understanding the socratic project and so again you have to pay attention to the structure uh and I I I think it it I I agree it's it's it helps to explain so many things like there's dialogues in which Socrates is the one that's getting sort of beaten up with the parmenities famous yeah yeah yeah right right and they're and there are and there are dialogues when Socrates withdraws or he's not even present like the later dialogues because Plato is he keeps trying to dramatize and write something and he's trying to and in the letter right you know the seventh letter uh Plato talks about how he he gave the world a more beautiful Socrates right uh and so you have to like there's something going on there above and beyond this is just you know a stage so that Plato's mouthpiece Socrates can utter propositions about some theory that Plato has which uh I I agree with many of the current scholarship Pluto doesn't have a theory of the forms the forms don't play that role in his theory um they they have a much different function and that's related to all this dialogical stuff we're talking about but I'm talking too much no no no this is this is great so I mean what do you what are you hoping what are you hoping to like what are you going where are you going for what are you hoping to accomplish with with this well I'm hope I I'm hoping that um well some things have already happened some people are uh even before this because of some of the interviews I've been having and discussions they're going back and rereading Plato and getting stuff out of it that they didn't get before and I think that's important um because I agree with Arthur verse Lewis what because we often don't read we often don't read the the actual dialogues we read you know regurgitations of them like we because we read read in secondary sources I had a similar experience I read the feedra recently because I because I was talking about the problem with pharmacon and you know I was in Judah and so I went back to read feedre and and now that even what you said just lit so many things for me because there's some gestures that Socrates poses like he covers his face at some point because he's too embarrassed to say certain things you know because you know it's like it's like this weird relation of Seduction you're not sure exactly what's going on in terms of Socrates and fidra uh and so so you realize that the gestures he's posing the the actual physical the way that he's described is acting as part of what he's trying to bring out in the problem of this outside world that he's in you know crossing the river going outside the city and now what is that space you know yes yes and you get you get the emphasis this is you know this goes way back to Gonzalez's book um dialectic and dialogue and Plato which is one of the first books of the Third Way arguing that Plato is really trying to point us towards non-propositional knowledge uh non-propositional knowing you can see why I would find that important and how Central that is for uh actually enabling and affording profound transformation and that the the socratic cultivation of the self is a properly aspirational cultivation of the self and therefore it is committed to profound transformation so all those things that Socrates are doing that are so weird right if you go back and re-read them um they they make they make they make a lot more they make a lot more sense which is what good exeges to do If people could read in this new way that's important yeah if they're if they would I agree with Arthur versus Lewis that I think neoplatonism is kind of like the spiritual grammar of the West um you and I sort of agree and sort of disagree on that and that's that's fine uh but um I think the degree to which people are and I don't mean this in an insulting way but to read which people are ignorant of it and agree to which people only know of it as a set of propositions about weird things that people used to think I think is the degree to which people are cut off from this very valuable uh well way of life and I want people to be I want to be able to afford people uh returning to this way of life and I as I keep emphasizing that returning to that way of life in a dialogical fashion which means that way of life has to be put into dialogue with other important ways of life and that's what is needed right now well that's my proposal at least yeah I what I love about what you're saying in terms of our constant discussion is that that there is a sense in which you seem to be proposing that the the it's a the vision that Plato presents or the even the vision that that Socrates presents you know through through Plato is bound in the drama like it's a story it's really that which is carrying let's say this is preventing the the ideas from being only propositional which is bringing them into into this engaged experience yes and again I don't deny the importance um but I would say that the point of the narrative given my previous point is to take us to what is beyond uh the narrative the non-propositional the non-narrative in some fashion um the relationship to the good or to the one um and and I think that's important um I'm I'm all I'm because because of you I'm in and I'm grateful for this I mean and these videos are going to be released soon I I mean I I'm gonna have two videos but I've had discussions Beyond this with um with Bishop Maximus from uh Patagonia who's an Eastern Orthodox uh bishop and also but also philosopher he teaches in the Seminary and we've been having an ongoing discussion about this uh he has a proposal about what he called and he's very strict about this the Transfiguration of neoplatonism within Christianity yeah and how that differs from how it was taken up in the West in scholasticism I think that's that's very very cool and so I don't want to deny what yes uh but but I but I want to say that and Plato uses Mythos and this is something people forget like and and he uses symbols in your sense of the word The Divided line is not an Al is something more like the sun isn't just an allegory we literally do depend on the size right right right right uh and so they're they're like you have to take all of these things you have to take the symbols The Narrative and the argument and also the character that's being put like all of this has to be taken in and I would argue because what Plato's trying to do is I mean he's clearly trying to get us he's trying to activate and integrate and make it present to us the non-propositional and how important and Central it is and how much it affords a way of transformation and that's why he uses all of these things because he's trying to simultaneously trigger the the propositional the procedural the perspective on the participatory and integrate them and then Orient them towards something yeah that's I mean I I think what you're saying I mean like I have to stop thinking because because it's really I'm really it's like I'm going through what I know like I haven't read all the dialogue but like the dialogue that I have read I'm kind of going through them and I'm seeing uh and also because there are some elements like you said there's some elements of the dialogue which gets pulled out sometimes and shown as being exemplary of what Plato thought but then you find contradiction if you if you see it there yes right so right in the in the um Symposium you get this silly myth right the silly myth of the with the round people like there's yeah yeah logos if you want to admit and get this like really silly myth of these circuit round people and like the two opposites that joined together which is weird because the modern people are not Sometimes using that as a actual like myth of ancient people believe but when you read it in the text it's clear that this is they're making fun of they're making fun of this uh and so I've I've read I remember having professors telling me like this is Plato mocking Mythos and how Mythos isn't part of of his thought but then when you go into when you see some of the images you use like the image of the Chariot for example with the two horses like there's these images that he uses that are that are right out of like my symbolic Playbook right they they just it perfectly fits into this idea of and and even there I think Plato's critique of Aristophanes um is very is nuanced I don't think it's mockery I think he also thinks there's something right about this idea of love finding something that it right um right to that is like that is lacking in us um and that we can't give to ourselves but we nevertheless need for our core self like like there's stuff in there because Socrates actually says that he thinks that well it's sort of Plato seems to indicate that Socrates Aristophanes speech is the best one until Socrates speaks right yeah yeah you're right because all the other ones are like sort of medical reductionism and just self self-indulgence but Aristophanes is so I agree there's a critique there I think it's more subtle than marketing yeah okay I think I think it's like um again it's like what's going on there um and and so it's it I think it's Plato in in that sense sort of being better than Aristophanes he's he's not simply like Aristophanes does in the clouds he's not simply mocking uh well you know but he's doing something a little bit more nuanced and and sophisticated around that yeah you're probably right maybe it's because I want him to be marking her stuff and he's so I agree to tell you that way even more but I mean but but think about it I mean there's even something in your work a lot about the left and the right hand and the master feminine that you know I get it it's it's presented in a comical fashion he's Aristophanes yeah but there's something in that myth that myth is also pushing on those yeah the idea of the androgynous being yeah for sure like I tend to see the the creation of Adam and Eve as being something like like when it says that it took Eve from Adam's side I tend to think of it like cut in half like this idea of separating and being into two opposites that's the way that I tend to see it so yeah definitely definitely so I mean I think this is it's exciting I can't wait to I definitely can't wait to see it and so are you are you offering it on YouTube are you going to be charging for it are you it's going to be just okay right it's free it's gonna be free um and it's gonna start um January 9th which is a Monday and it'll be twice a week Mondays and Thursdays um and you just go on the YouTube channel and you can watch it and um there'll be some more promo videos and I'm going to release a couple of videos to try and try to help people hopefully not in a heavy-handed fashion like how to how to take this how to relate uh to after Socrates um um and so I'm very excited about it too um it's um it feels yeah Awakening was really comprehensive it was a huge argument um this one is much more like you said it's a bunch more about trying to conduce people into right A pathway uh and um I think of one that we've lost and one that uh I think we need to properly recover as a way of responding to the meaning crisis so it goes towards a criticism and a good criticism that many people made and you made a version of it and you know that I've responded in in the ways that I can to your criticisms I take them I take them to heart but you know but at the end but but what do you do like oh you have a few practices you know like and that's no yeah that's exactly right that's a good criticism there's been two fundamental responses and they're bound up in after Socrates one was you and Paul and you particularly uh you know this is a very individualistic project and and so I've yeah no no you're right and this is why the dialogical it's so important secondly it's like there's some practices and all that but you know there's a way of life and yes right and that's what I'm trying to bring out together in after Socrates yes um the not make this uh uh you know individualistic in nature um make it properly dialogical rather than monological and also not don't just talk about some practices and some there but talk about something much more comprehensive a way of life so that's that's how I'm trying to respond to some of the criticisms yeah and in some ways also I think what's interesting is I kind of see you honing in on a neoplatonic like more and more like pointing in on this new platonic strain and it also has a it also I think has the advantage of being something that already has a coherence to it right it already is a kind of coherent body and so on the one hand you can reinterpret and you can let's say let's say play with it in ways to emphasize certain things and not but it but I think that it definitely will I think for People for People kind of coming to it it'll it'll present more as this as a path like this here's this coherent path that has existed for about for thousands of years it's like it's part of the western path for sure like there's no way to avoid it this has been yeah you know this has been something that has followed through from before before uh Christianity it influenced Judaism and then it kind of went into Christianity and so for even if Christians sometimes can criticize and say like no we need the we need the Christian version let's say it's at least I think a robust position to hold like it's a it's a it's a place to stand where you can really engage in the discussion and and and you you have all this Foundation to to pull on and it doesn't see because a lot of the new spirituality sometimes people they pull in from everywhere right yeah which is which I understand why because in some ways that's what happens when you're kind of lost not lost but you're when things are broken you're like okay you know pointing like this exactly and so and so you you you know you go to you go to a conference and then people will be you know it's a western person standing in front of you who probably grew up as a Christian and and all they're citing the Buddhist texts and Indian texts and a native a native perspective and everything and it's like well okay I get it but now what like what do I do but but the platonic tradition it has that core it has that uh place to stand on it feels like thank you for saying that the the uh I mean I'm of course proposing I'm not proposing Nostalgia I'm proposing we pick it up and how to move it forward that's a big part of it too uh but exactly thank you for saying that and and secondly that that that hopefully shifts the focus off me onto this path um uh and way of life and I'm trying to articulate it and I'm trying to I'm trying to contribute and to propose how it can be taken forward um and it can help you deal with the guru problem like the modern Guru problem yeah exactly exactly I want to avoid the guru problem and um and so that both of those things are important and after Socrates is an attempt to address those two like you say can can can this can this be a coherent thing that feeds back into tradition yes um and then the second one is how do we how do we get this focused on a way of life and not sort of just on me and and the things I'm talking about um and so it it's it's trying to do both of those as well that's also why I have people other than me playing important parts within the presentation yeah I mean it will will definitely be paying attention to that that's I mean it sounds great I can't wait to see and then I'll and I can't wait to argue with you about things that I don't agree with of course of course and I'll expect you to yeah and I hope you see that I'm responding to a lot of criticisms and you know criticisms given with effect affection and respect by you and others in how I'm doing this I I this is my way of trying to be deeply responsive and responsible um to a lot of those points and of course I expect that you and Paul and other people will like well this is what I disagree with John and that's fine um uh but but I do uh there's a there's a way of responding to criticisms that is not the attempt to to silence conversation or prevent disagreement but that at least people acknowledge Yes you heard me and you've done something constructive in response and that's what I'm trying to do that's great yeah that's wonderful and So based on what on that I think that one of the things that I've appreciated that's been going that I've seen happen recently is you know there I there has been there was this contention it didn't seem contentious when we were talking about it when we had this discussion a while ago with Rebel wisdom and I brought up the idea that the way that you talk about transpersonal agency in seems to connect very closely to the ancient way that people talked about yeah about Spiritual Beings and how Spiritual Beings affect us and everything and it seems like there was an interesting possibility creating the bridge and that I think since I've been speaking on YouTube it's the thing that I that has brought about on me the most criticism and it's also because it probably until then I didn't touch like I was Far Enough from from let's say touching the modern psychological apparatus or the modern way in which we understand things so that people either didn't know what I was talking about or didn't see how it was going to affect like their world view didn't challenge them yeah and challenge the world view exactly and so I've appreciated I I've seen you let's say being forced to like defend just even talking to me in terms of this question uh so so I wanted to express that thanks as well because I really appreciate it I know that in some ways probably it's it's still an exploratory discussion yeah I know that that uh there are several questions that still need to be let's say that have to be dealt with in terms of understanding how these things Bridge or not or how they connect but uh but I appreciate the fact that that you defended me let's say or you tried to defend my position even though you don't necessarily even hold my position I yeah I I well first of all the defense of the proposal is because I think there's there is Parts I deeply agree with we do disagree on some points but there's Parts I deeply do agree with and uh and even the parts I I disagree with I think it is a proposal that should be taken seriously um and and yeah I yeah there was a couple of videos and I also did uh I did a stupid thing I tried to make an argument on Twitter defending you uh yeah yeah never do that yeah I think so well I have to say there was a lot of positive uptake of that argument uh and so yeah there were sort of three venues in which uh I tried like because they were trying to make you sound like an idiot and I I am well I'm I'm first of all I'm really convinced you're not an idiot and secondly uh you again I just I also deeply dislike that strategy uh that that I I mean I get it a lot too uh it's usually along the lines of John is just blah blah blah blah therefore I can dismiss him it's a dismissive strategy rather than an engagement strategy and I think there's no defense at all for dismissive strategies I think if you do this just a strategy you deserve to be dismissed seriously um and so that also sort of got me a little bit like ah first of all Jonathan's not an idiot uh he he enters in good faith and he brings a lot of intelligence I I try to bold out what I thought the argument was at least how I was taking it right and then and then it's like don't be dismissive engage or shut up right I'm sorry I'm just like like please right we we we do not need uh we like that that that that dismissive at I don't have to think about you because here's my you know you've put in you know two decades of work and I can dismiss it by this it's a three premise there's three sentence response I like like come on like please right enter in like ask questions make criticisms but don't but do it in an Engaged fashion don't try to be dismissive and what I was hearing was an attempt to dismiss you which is also what what that irks me yeah and so and so I I've been thinking a lot about because I you know I I listen like I listen to the to the the poking and people saying like what what is going on like how does he try to connect how does he able to connect these things together I've been thinking a lot about the idea of transpersonal agency in terms of again trying to bridge the traditional categories like the angiology of the ancient world and the even just the hierarchy of gods or the hierarchy of principality that you find in every single uh culture so the problem is is also in terms of the dismissive the dismissive tone is like it's like if I'm trying to bridge a way to help you understand in a in a in a more reasonable fashion something which exists in every culture you know for has existed in every culture for thousands of years it seems like this is a that should not unless you want to dismiss those cultures completely as being stupid for thousands of years despite let's say also having civilizations which will probably last longer than ours yes no it's like I don't know I think that it's it's probably a better a better uh effort rather to help to try to help us understand what they were doing if we can help people in our terms today help them help us understand at least a little bit what they were doing they seems like that's something that we that is worth the effort I I totally agree and I think you're right I think that part of this is right uh exactly uh sort of the Enlightenment Mythos of uh of the priority of of the of the present and the future and the future the the past is something we leave behind because it was bound in Superstition Etc I think it's completely legitimate for us with knowledge that we have that people in the past didn't have to make criticisms but I think it's also important to realize that we as you said are also locked into ways of seeing that might you know might might be open to Serious education by paying attention to what other cultures at other times have said even our own culture in previous historical epochs this is part of what I was saying earlier about like we we had a we hadn't we had a way of reading Plato that was largely so that we could put Plato behind us so that we could get to Descartes this is like this introduction to philosophy here's Plano here's some Aristotle see why this doesn't work Descartes right and then Descartes can't and there we and and boost right and because all that really matters are these core epistemological problems it's like well maybe not maybe that's actually the wrong way of framing the whole problem of you know right and so I think that that that that there's a lot of trying to dismiss you um because you you are doing exactly what you're talking about you're talking you're trying to say maybe there's something we can learn from these people and their mythological World Views I happen to agree with that um I don't happen to agree with everything you say about it but I happen to agree with that part of it yeah um and and I I'm not quite and I even and I even when I made the argument I said like putting aside the religious thing durkheim makes similar arguments yeah and your claim is like Central to anthropology and sociology I'm not saying durkheim is right but people don't go oh stupid durkheim who like no no he's a pivotal figure like like like yeah I think the difference between between let's say what I am trying to propose and what durkheim would have been proposing is that I am proposing a type of agency which is real coming from above and so it's not just that humans put things as as you know Elevate things as being let's say totems you know or or characteristics that they that they create their identity around which is which seems to be more a bit what durkheim was proposing rather that there's also what there's definitely a top-down relationship that that identity then binds and that there is a form of agency which binds coming back down on the group which is which is bound by it okay so two things to say about that first of all that second part I think there's a cognitive scientific argument to be made about that about distributed cognition and collective intelligence top-down causation and you know that you and I have talked about that the other thing is I think I think you should be a little bit more charitable to durkheim I think durkheim he doesn't have that developed but he definitely has the idea of the super organic and and and and you know and and uh and that that represents or has an impact on people it's I think it's it's preliminary in durkheim but I think there's a legitimate opening even within durkheim for talk talking about right collective intelligence distributed cognition and its top-down effect on an individual participants which only strengthens the argument to my mind yeah yeah yeah and so and I've been thinking a little bit about the question of independent existence because I know that's one of the things that came up in the discussion which is that do these angels exist without humans right do these transpersonal agencies without humans and I tend like I always have the same approach like my I really believe in a fractal structure of reality and so if I want to test something up here I'd test it down here at my level and I and I I use that as an analogy to help me transpose the problem and so the question happened the same question can be asked about me the question is do I exist without my body and the answer is it's a ridiculous question it's actually not a question like what are you asking you know that at least in the Christian position like Saint Gregor Nissa says clearly that humans begin to the Human begin to exist in their bodies they don't pre-exist in some temporal way you could say that they exist in the mind of God from all eternity if you wanted to say something like that or they exist in the totality of all things like there are ways to formulate like a kind of pre-existence but it's not uh it's not a pre-existence in time and so the idea of understanding uh transpersonal agencies seems to be the same so there's a manner in which we can say it pre-exists just like you could say about you to a certain in certain manner like just follow me through this argument right that you pre-exist your body and the reason why you could say something like you pre-exist your body is because the elements of your body are changing and so like the the actual like chemicals in your body and the parts like they're not the same that you had when you were born right they they they've moved they it's like it's a it's a what is it the ship of Theseus problem right yes yes very much and so you you you pre-exist your body in that sense and so you could also understand that transpersonal agency pre-exists the bodies in that sense that is a basketball team that has a coherent agency acting on it that acts as a body the players can change right that and the even the management can change there's a certain amount of of variability possible in the body but the agency can remain the same despite the change of the body there's a limit there's a limit at some point if you shatter the the manifestation too much like if you shatter the body too much and at some point it at some point it separates and then then there's no then there's no being like there's no being anymore but but so I think that if we see it that way then we we can both understand the reason why we talk about Angelic pre-existence but also understand that Angels don't exist without their subtle bodies either like they exist in the world through the effects that they have and so that you know the angel of Charity doesn't exist without charity like there has to be acts of Charity in the world where the angel of Charity to exist like the let's say the the Angelic the virtues which are one of the hierarchy of angels are the easiest to understand in that sense it's like there is no Angel of Hope without hope there has to be hope there has to be a body of Hope for the Angel of Hope to exist okay this first of all this is tremendously helpful um I I let me let me try and say something similar and I um so we talked about you know you know non-reducibility the um you can't reduce uh you I can't reduce you to your chemical structures because you are instantiated in different chemicals that and your body isn't the same even physical body it was when you were 25 and all that sort of ship of uh Theseus kind of thing I mean same thing with a computer program I can put this computer program in this computer or that computer or that computer what makes it the same program now can it be free of any computer that's weird but can you reduce it to any one computer no and in that sense it it you know it pre-exists being in that computer because it's in this computer Etc and then secondly like you said that it it these things can't exist um independently of their manifestations and and I think let me let I'll try and phrase this as a question there's a connection that coming up we got into a point in our discussion where I propose to you that these higher things might not have Consciousness or self-consciousness and and you were very gracious about that you said you know there there might be something in that because the angels are actually really weird in a lot of Mythology and they they like the angel of death is that like is that a self-conscious being and stuff like that like and and I thought that was also very helpful uh because I think there's a lot of questions that are being mixed up together here and so are these things self-conscious um do they exist before us independently from us self-consciously and I think what you're saying and I'm not saying we completely agree but you're saying those questions are kind of picking up on the wrong Parts like you're emphasizing aspects of the mythology that are are not actually the parts that should be emphasized um uh so I I I I I guess what I'm asking is does that sound like I'm getting you fairly I think so I think so I think I do think that I'm definitely I'm far more open to the idea of Consciousness transpersonal Consciousness because I I really don't see any reason apart from that I can't experience it that they're that they're that Consciousness and self-consciousness should should that human beings should be the crown of of Consciousness like I don't necessarily see that that's necessary in any way like because I see Consciousness scaling you know up to me up to a human I I have like like I said just the the reason why I I hesitate is because I can't experience the consciousness of a transpersonal being like I I don't have access to it I don't I don't know like I don't even know what that would be like what type of Consciousness would it be but I definitely don't exclude it because uh because I yeah because there's something it's interesting though there's something about agency and Consciousness which I find fascinating in some of the secularist type of argument which is that there seems to be a desire to make like the human person very very special in some ways because like the the offense that I feel like this almost this this sense of like that all of a sudden you know you're touching this deep taboo when I say why wouldn't there be transpersonal Consciousness like why does it bother you that that would be a a reality if you notice the pattern of agency acting on groups of humans why does it bother you that there would be Consciousness uh as even and materialists like even as a naturalist why would the human being be the summit of all things like I I that that's also something that I that I've been wondering about in terms yeah let me help you on that point and then all well first of all it's like notice how important Consciousness and self-consciousness is for agency and for attribution and you're trying to put that into a worldview that often tries to claim that Consciousness and self-consciousness are reducible at the phenomenal of knowing like that that's a big tension that's a huge tension in in that sort of position it's like then you're saying that there really is something ontologically real and important about Consciousness and self-consciousness and that doesn't fit in well with any kind of reductive materialism so first of all I I think you're arguing a big strength in there secondly um I this has to go and I don't want to repeat our conversation right I I never said in principle that it wasn't possible I just said I think I do I do kind of something like you do I look at what are what are the con conditions that seem to track here with Consciousness about connectivity and recursivity and stuff that really exemplified in the nervous system do we have good evidence that that's possible is it logically possible yes do we have any physical means of instantiating that right now I don't think so so I tend to say I think we have clear evidence for intelligence I think that not in principle but in practice right now I don't see how it can be yeah so you would say intelligence and agency but not not Consciousness but so here's my full thing we're not self-consciousness right intelligence and agency not Consciousness or self-consciousness but not in principle impossible only in fact not the case that's a different thing yeah yeah yeah so like so sorry because we are going to kind of could jump back into our conversation but but like so if so when it's let's say a city uh defends itself against parasites like when a city defends itself against criminals and so you you can't see that there's a form of of consciousness of its state like it there's a form of consciousness of its borders and how it's well no because I think you're not crumbling and how it's How It's let's say holding together or functioning smoothly until it sends out it sends out like some kind of but you bodies do that without Consciousness I understand I understand that's what I think I can say your immune system is fantastically intelligent at that and yet I have no reason or evidence that it's conscious let alone self-conscious yeah but it happens through like it will happen through meaningful orders especially in that case it'll be like a law there'll be like a statement there'll be like a general telling the military to go and do these things like there'll be this there'll be like a a at least at the level of the humans will be Consciousness going down like towards the action they would agree but even that is not all the way down because your Consciousness doesn't permeate down to the chemical interactions that are making your body move no for sure not no for sure so I like I I see Consciousness attenuating at both ends okay that way right all right so I I like I said I I mean I definitely hold the traditional I hold the traditional kind of Christian position in some ways so I I tend to but I understand why we need to definitely to do I need to think about it more and we need to do more work in terms of trying to find ways to to formulate the analogies so so we can see how far we can go with this question and and and and I also again want to say you know the three papers that I published with Dan Chaffee about you know the scientists moving The Rovers around in Mars and all of this uh two things like this is this is this idea about Collective agency collective intelligence distributed cognition we agency this is Cutting Edge stuff so this is innovative and important and secondly and and this is not inconsequential you know and I've picked up on this and some of the talks I gave it like the talk I gave at Cambridge like there was a there was a spirituality that naturally sort of emerged within the scientists this weird thing about how they like they really almost sympathize aesthetically magically identified with the Rover and they did these rituals where they would embody the Rover or they would anthropomize the Rover and personalize it and and this was not just ornamental this was crucial to them being able to do the work like that's also an important point to be made and I make it uh like again it's not the same as what you're claiming but it's also but it it also means that you're not like saying something completely like you know out of the blue yeah well for sure in the case that you're talking about it could definitely help you understand totemization practices like different types of of practices tribal practices of identification with with Spirit Animals you know like this idea of certain characteristics that that we recognize as as identifying us and then binding us but then also manifesting in the way we act and so there's you could you could see how that would function to cohere a group and get them to act coherently against their enemies in the world they together with other tribes like they would do that you can understand that with your Mars Rover experiment definitely right and it also it points to the ritual and the imaginal like that that's not just sort of a belief system they're enacting it and they're and they're and they're drawing on the photographs and they're doing all this stuff that's imaginable in order to afford them actually being able to be present isn't on Mars to get that actual perspectival knowing like it it's so again I agree with everything you said about and and vertese does use the word totem by the way that the Rover became a totem for them but I want you to understand that it's simultaneously like a social process but also it it interpenetrates deeply into cognitive accordance it actually enables people to do to see and to do the work they need to do yeah it's not so yeah it's not just like you said it actually makes the it makes it easier for them to to exist this way like it's not just that they're not just they're not just telling themselves I mean like let's say like it's not just a team rattling themselves up you know with their mascot and with their things there's more of a kind of an actual embodiment of the Rover through practices that that make it that what they're trying to do is more effective yep exactly exactly exactly and and that by the way then feeds back that see the spirituality and the affordance of uh of agency feedback into the point we're making before about top-down effects actually making a difference in the cognition and the sense making of the individuals hmm all right yeah that makes a lot of sense and and definitely definitely it is it is more food for thought and and I know that we're going to continue this conversation forever as long as we as long as we still breathe so I would want to say that this stuff and actually some of the more recent stuff I've done on the imaginal and the ritual also gets developed and articulated um in after Socrates yeah and I think that's great I also think that there's a their I mean I'm gonna say this I might get in trouble for this but you know the notion of the imaginal has been controversial in in Orthodox circles because of the ascetic practice of hezekism and ezicasm the the because the the um these because what the the monk or what the practitioner is trying to do is to attain Unity Full Union with God there's a sense in which the imaginal space becomes a dangerous face like it's a yes it's an intermediary like it's like the spirits of the air right this intermediary space that has to be that has to be crossed in order to reach the highest person so the tendency is to say ignore the images ignore the ignore the imagination part so that you can reach silence and beauty and light right so basically going all the way up into the highest fear but I think that a lot of work that that uh certain people that I know have been doing or father and justiniano some of my work and other people's work as well by using iconography like what we did in Thunder Bay right using iconography as the support to show that this imaginal space also has a positive as a positive manifestation and it's like the church full of all these paintings and drawings and images like it really is and the way that it's structured and how it does represent a cosmic image and all of this I think has been has been a good bridge to help people understand that that the the there is room in Christianity for this notion of a positive vision of this intermediary world and and the imaginal space and we need it because without it I think that we're I think that we're very like Christians are very vulnerable without developing a robust vision of this intermediary space I totally agree and I think um the imaginal is I mean it's just it's like what we said about narrative um or right it it it's bound up with uh human cognition an important way I I would propose to you that my attitude towards the narrative is is the same one you're trying to propose about the imaginal yes it's not even my it is a deep tradition in the Orthodox in the Orthodox tradition of of uh being suspicious of of that space so so I kind of have to deal with it I myself am more obviously more I mean I I you if you people know what I'm doing like writing comic books I mean I'm making all these things I'm obviously more I have more room for it but I I also want to formulate in a way that's respectful to the tradition because I I do I do believe that they're that they're good reasons why Hezekiah had the form that it did so so maybe then what I what I've been trying to say um and again we don't have to pick this up because we keep going this is another one of our theories uh by the way before I forget you released the video I think was part of your q a where you sort of said flat out you know John is right about this about the nomological I want to now return and say thank you for you doing that that was gracious and that was you know part of what we're all trying to do here together uh but what I want to say is I think the narrative is important it is uh powerful but it is intermediary that is in a nutshell what I'm trying to say in a lot of ways yeah I keep getting casters John doesn't like it's unfair to attribute to me John doesn't John's a Critic of the narrative or doesn't think narrative I've never said that I never said that I know we gave you from the meeting crisis that is not my position and I don't and I it's really straw personing me to attribute that to yeah but I think that understanding and this is the same for the imaginal question as well is that you see it in the ascetic I really sangrer needs his uh life of Moses you see it clearly in that text you see you see the Moses goes up the mountain he removes the garments of skin he removes the layers he he moves into Divine Darkness so he basically moves out of any form any form any any representation and then but then when he crosses that space he's given the he's given the pattern of the Tabernacle and so the idea is that this space which is above the narrative anonymological let's say the Transcendent or the non-dual or whatever however you want to name it it's the source of it right it's the source of that other space and so so it gives birth to it and it gives it its proper its proper form so so it's like so there's no so you can have both the aesthetic understanding of moving into that which is beyond being but then also understanding that yeah it's also the father of being it's also that which gives being makes it makes it exist I just you just did to my mind and I don't think this is dismissive of what you just did I'm not taking anything away from Gregory but that's also Socrates that's a republic and then they return and if you if you separate the ascent from the return you don't understand the ascent I was very very clear about this yeah uh and DC Schindler makes a fantastic argument and that see that's what that that the fact that there's that convergence there about exactly that point right um and that's again that's why that's why I want to be doing what I'm doing because then we can oh right let's make these connections let's draw this out yeah but that point I think the point about how the Transcendent gives birth to the world and how it the world actually exists out of it I think it's important today because there's in the say in the spiritual but not religious yeah you get that argument right where it's like well I don't want the religion I don't want the forms I don't want any of the practices I just want the top thing right you know I believe in non-duality I just want that and everything else like I don't want and so there's a there's a there's a kind of naivete about then how does then the world exist like how is it there's more than a night hey there's more there's more here's here's Schindler's read on Plato which I think is profound the absolute that does not include the relative is not the absolute right because then it's not if you're non-duality does not afford and properly I don't know what to say uh give birth to I'm trying to like yeah then you don't unders you haven't properly understood it you you've reified it uh like again the the the ascent and The Descent the emanation and the emergence you can't you know you and I've been sort of not arguing about this is something we're converging on a lot on and and and and I I think that that connection you just made is so appropriate right there's a profound naivete because it's based on a profound misunderstanding and misapprehension if you think the absolute does not include and I mean deeply Encompass and interpenetrate the relative then you have not understood it at all you've turned it into something like a totalitarian thing it's a totalizing rather than an absolute and that and I think Schindler just knocks that argument out of the ballpark it just says look and this is Plato's argument again and again and again and again again I think what you said I'm just deepening it that spiritual bypassing is not just naivete it's naivete that is driven by a kind of profound misunderstanding and misapprehension yeah and like you said it does it leads to it leads to two impulses it leads to a totalitarian impulse and it leads to a kind of anarchic impulse yeah both at the same time like it's like either anything goes and could just do whatever because it's like nothing it's all it's all nothing compared to the absolute or rather control like everything has got to be got to be completely ordered and and and has to so so yeah so you're right so they're they're and in a way like that's the right that's a that's the right hand of the left hand right there that's that that that that optimal grip that that you talk about you know this idea that there's this letting go and everything has a letting go and a grasping to it yeah yeah that's a neces it's necessary for the thing to actually exist I think that's exactly right and I think you like you you have to be you have to be constantly opening to the the the the the the the the one the absolute the inexhaustible and you also have to be closing to the finite right the right uh uh the suchness and you have to be constantly doing both or you don't have like you said you don't have a world yeah you don't have a world you know and you don't have the you know you have neither an intelligible World nor the optimal grip needed to realize that intelligible world and that's why spiritual and but I mean insofar as it is spiritual bypassing as a psychological category which it is that's what people are trying to do right it's kind of a crypto Gnostic thing of trying to pretend and I think there is something pretentious of it that we can somehow be free from the world like in our embodiment and and and and then we don't have a we don't have a a a a a a a moral uh we don't have moral and epistemic responsibilities which we do I mean I've got kids like if the absolute makes me not treat my kids well well I'm sorry like that's not what we're not the absolute dude something else yeah um and so I I and I I admit to be fair to me I did make this explicit criticism in a way for the meaning crisis I said any notion of Enlightenment that that does not have something to tell me about how to deal with the perennial problems and cultivate wisdom I'm not interested in that notion of Enlightenment and why should you be why should you be other than you're having some unique experience that you find really personally wonderful like how is that not just self-indulgence or narcissism I'm sorry that's uh right I I I'm not saying that people don't have a right to engage in spiritual exploration or anything like that I'm not saying that but when we're talking specifically about what goes wrong in spiritual bypassing I think that's what goes wrong in it um this is great John I need to I need to go I need to go to another appointment but this is always you we could just keep going that's the problem just keep talking forever so everybody so so give the the last tell people again where the after Socrates when is it coming where is it going to be okay so after Socrates January the 9th there's going to be lots of promo videos uh there's already been One released um it's going to come out on YouTube you know you'll subscribe to my channel and you'll get it right away uh it's free you don't have to pay uh it'll be released twice a week probably Mondays and Thursdays twice a week is for sure we're not quite sure if it's gonna what that's the Mondays and Thursdays probably Monday for sure probably Thursday but definitely twice a week um January the 9th look for it uh really strongly recommend try to watch it with some other people do the discussions around the points to ponder do the practices individually and collectively and then discuss the practices and the relationship between the practices and the propositions please I think I think you'll find it of great value all right thanks John and uh you will definitely be talking soon again if if not very soon then for sure if we do if we have this conference in California that'll that'll be great as well so as you know I'm always looking forward to talking to you it's been great thank you so much Jonathan all right bye-bye bye
