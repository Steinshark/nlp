one of the executives at the largest nft marketplace in the world just got caught insider trading nfts for personal profit proving once again that the real way to make money in these markets is insider trading baby and if you don't have that insider knowledge by the time you hear about it you're 10 steps behind let me walk you through this money laundering disaster ladies and gentlemen welcome to the 10 million dollar studio i'm your host coffee zilla so here's the headline right here dodging it earlier right open c confirms executive used insider knowledge when buying nfts now for those of you who don't know what insider trading is basically where someone buys some investment whether it be an art stock penny stock using insider knowledge that the public doesn't have access to yet to gain an edge to make money from you so what does this look like in practice let me give you an example in 2020 there was a secret briefing on a new exciting um virus trying to stay monetized boys okay this is before anyone knew about the big one nine right and all these senators met up and they learned about it what did they do with this highly classified information they bought millions of dollars in health stock companies because they know of course they're about to spike in value that's what insider trading is you take information that the public doesn't know yet you use it to try to make a profit in some financial market now let me make this clear this in theory is illegal right it's a financial crime did those senators go to jail no why because no justice works okay the sec is asleep at the wheel guys i don't know what to tell you they've just been pounding nyquil for years now it appears but it's in theory illegal so with that in mind that context let me explain what happened with openc so the head of product at openc is nate chastain and last night he was accused of having secret crypto accounts that he used to flip nfts for a profit this twitter user has the story hey openc why does it appear that nate chastain has a few secret wallets that appear to buy your front page drops before they are listed then sells them shortly after the front page hype spike for profits and then tumbles then back to his main wallet uh with his punk on it now what he's referring to is the fact that anytime you go to open c they have a featured art project and he's accusing the head of product of using this knowledge ahead of time to buy up these art art pieces and selling them for a profit once it hit the main page and so obviously when i saw this uh pretty big accusation here i wanted to know did he actually do it that sounds so obvious so crazy what secret accounts are they so i dived in to the blockchain this is actually what i enjoy about crypto the blockchain ladies and gentlemen doesn't lie yes it's easier than ever to launder money yes that's very true but there's also so many people who launder it very poorly like old nate here and so what i love is in the past when people insider traded it was hard to find out now you have their their wallet addresses it's pretty much open and shut so the first thing we had to do when investigating nate to find out if he did insider trade or not based on the uh front page of openc we had to find which wallets belong to him luckily for us some of them are public like this one as you can see it has his twitter account here but it also has a cryptopunk so if we go looking for this cryptopunk here we can actually find another one of his accounts this one right here which is currently unnamed but look at that it's the actual owner of this crypto punk that's his profile picture and it has an ethereum name nate c dot eth nate chastain lines up additionally it gets paid by his main wallet which you can see here his public wallet is paying out his nft wallet his little secret nft wallet that he thought no one would know about but nate didn't just stop there as far as trying to hide what he was doing with these um nft insider trades see i mind mapped what he was actually doing here which um yeah i know i know i know what it looks like but what this is is a map of our boy nate's misdeeds here he's been um laundering money through shell accounts right uh so it looks like this in practice this is what one of his nft flips looks like so nate this is nate's uh little secret nft wallet right here which then links to some of his other main wallets over here uh but nate's little wallet here what he would do is when he knew something a drop was coming up he would send eth to usually an intermediary wallet which then he would uh just send all that money to another secret wallet which nobody has seen before ox 7942 for example and he would do all the nft flipping from this wallet here which is in theory connected but sort of uh not obviously connected to his main wallet after the flipping was done he would send the profits back to his main wallet here now here's what that looks like from the nft perspective here's that same wallet ox 7942 and as you can see this account bought up art pieces like spectrum of a ramification theory for .25 ether and quickly flipped it for 1.5 ether a profit of about three thousand four thousand dollars now of course we go to the internet archive the day he was doing this the day he was flipping this nft guess what shows up on the front page spectrum of a ramification theory the exact same nft that he just flipped for an instant profit in one day this is how the scheme worked he then took that extra ether he just gained and remember he sends that back to his main wallet so he sends five ether creates a little shell account network and then sends back seven ether which is like a two ethereum profit eight thousand dollars not bad for one day of work and just so you know this wasn't a one time thing here's another example he sends five ether to this account which then sends it over to this little shell account where he would do his flipping so this is ox50d0 here it is ladies and gentlemen also unnamed and we can see it bought up a bunch of this journey and her loyal fellowship art which then it flipped from a price of like 0.29 and he flipped it for one ether and of course when we go back to the day that he did this we see journey and her loyal fellowship show up on the front page once again showing that nate knew and was trading what was on the front page he's done this many many times like with this art piece focus which of course shows up on the front page about the time that he bought and sold it and i guess the big question is how much did he make from this little uh money laundering network or i don't know if you call it money laundering i mean it's very clear that he's trying to hide what he's doing right like he there'd be no reason if he was fine with uh being public about this to send all this ethereum to other addresses all these wallets that's why i call it money laundering because you're trying to hide what you're doing and trying to hide where this money is going it's very clear he knows what he's doing is wrong right he's not just um innocent didn't know this was a bad thing to do like he's very clearly trying to obfuscate where this money's coming from and going so the question is how much money did he make right um it's hard to say because i didn't go back and do every single transaction that would take like forever but what we do know is that his main account where he's sending all this eve back to has a balance of a little over half a million dollars ladies and gentlemen which is that all from nft flipping i don't know i don't know right i don't know it could be and it could be more honestly because it could have other shell accounts it could be less than that um it's hard to say the point is this is definitely insider trading and it's definitely seriously messed up which is why i guess today openc posted about it and said that they learned that one of their employees purchased items that they knew were about to be displayed on the front page before they appeared there publicly and we're flipping them it's incredibly disappointing blah blah our organization's not like this it's the general like you know company response i guess and it looks to me they say they're gonna do their own investigation but from what i can see this is a pretty open and shut case when you actually look at the associated wallets it's clear that not only he was doing this but it's also clear that he was hiding it which i think is way more egregious than if you were just doing it out in the open the fact that you're creating all these shell accounts means you know what you're doing and so not to be like uh clairvoyant or anything but i think this guy's gonna get fired pretty quickly as he should be frankly i mean this is not a matter of like cancel culture this is just uh she's like you can't do this you're that a product you can't trade against your own customers it's insane what's also interesting about this is that as people figured out that nate did this posts from like a month ago started to surface where people had were starting to point this out they noticed this art which was featured on the front page they said looks like nate from open c got the jump before anyone else he put links to him getting it and nate responds i just wanted to secure one of these before they all disappeared to be honest but of course we know that's not true because he was selling these so it wasn't because they were going to disappear it's because he wanted to flip them for money so this was coming out already it was only a matter of time and of course we have the response in regulated markets this would be called insider trading and would be punishable with a large fine and incarceration now of course crypto being what it is not everyone thought that any of this was a problem here's this guy saying maybe it's not ethical but i'd almost definitely do the same thing red flak it's not like he's stealing people's he just is in a unique position to know which products are almost definitely going to pump before they do that's insider trading let's be real it'd be kind of dumb not to take advantage now this guy responds it's called insider trading and it's illegal at least in the fiat world now this whole exchange is hilarious to me um especially this guy people who kind of defend it and go ah it's not that bad it's just funny to me crypto crypto people like this who think that like illegal things in fiat are perfectly okay in the crypto world why it's funny to me is that these are the same types of people that are gonna get on wall street bets and cry about the injustice of the insider trading that goes on on wall street they see that as a problem right nobody defends the wall street guys inside of trading everyone kind of understands that that's obviously wrong that people with insider uh knowledge are basically betting against you and you lose out because of that crypto seems to like break people's brains where they think like things aren't illegal like ah we could just money launder that's fine we could just uh set up a bunch of shell accounts do some shady stuff that's that's that's all fine whatever look it may be fine now i don't know uh but it's not gonna be fine for long yes the sec is asleep right but eventually every bear wakes up and a lot of these guys they're gonna get taken down but either way whether someone gets arrested or not like this is definitely wrong what this guy has done all this money is extracted from their own user base the openc user base and i think what it shows is that um even these so-called decentralized platforms like openc yeah they describe themselves as decentralized even they can be gamed by people insider trading self-dealing things like that because i know we were all promised that you know we decentralized it guys it's impossible for anything to go wrong it's just coins and code guys but time time and time again that turns out to be false right like humans do humans things some percentage of them will always lie cheat and steal to get ahead and i think the point is you need some safeguards in place to stop people from doing this and i think you know if the average nft person understands this the investor i think they hopefully would think twice about you know just jumping into a brand new project because i think that's that's really a problem right now you have all these people with insider knowledge or influencers who can manipulate the market and they're just doing it right in front of you guys and if you're an average investor that doesn't have access to these things you're at a disadvantage like it's a saying that goes back forever if you're sitting at a poker table and you don't know who the sucker is you are the sucker the same is kind of true with krypto specifically these like thousand x coins and stuff if you think you're getting in and you have no idea how you're gonna make your money um chances are people are making money off of you oh by the way steven from the future here guys um just wanted to say because it takes me forever to edit these videos since i started making this video um he's been fired give it up for nate congratulations nate
