ladies and gentlemen it's quite a fun and exciting time right now in the world of Chess Magnus Carlson just won the freestyle goat chess challenge hikaru's over 3400 Blitz on chess.com I have once again been kidnapped to an undisclosed location and I'm recording my videos inside of a hotel room on a serious note I'm at I'm in Charlotte for the chesin national festival I also promised a couple people who I ran into I would shout them out at the beginning of a video one day some of you may run into me on the street and ask for shout out and I may or might may not give it if you're annoying I probably won't but these people weren't annoying so number one shout out to Albert and number two I met the Colorado team fencing gold medal winners uh it was a group of uh four Dudes super fun guys uh they were very nice uh we all took pictures together so if if any of these people end up in the comment section say hello in today's video we will cover yet another superstar in the Chess World and his name is Hans demon the polarizing Hans demon the uh the love him or hate him Hans nean and Hans Neeman is back in Action he's currently playing in jerba which uh is in North Africa if I'm not mistaken I think it's it's like an island uh off the coast of Tunisia I probably should have looked this up before making the recap but I'm only back in my room for about an hour so I'm going to make this video maybe take a nap cuz I'm a baby and then go back to the chesca national festival but this was a beautiful game and um as we all know Hans has recently been uh banned from uh St Louis chess club tournaments that's a bit of an overstatement but you know they published the whole thing if you missed it it was on my second channel uh called Gotham 2 I'll put a link in the description but so he's trying to get as many opportunities that he can to play a tournament and his first round opponent is none other than Ari andari Ari andari being the number two rated player uh in Norway I recently beat Ari andari in title Tuesday that has nothing to do with this video I just wanted to I just wanted to flex I just want to feel good about myself Hans in this game opens with D4 D5 Knight F3 Knight F6 and now uh a big a big sideline already played by Hans uh not a Queen's Gambit not a London which in this position are the two most common moves by far in this position Hans demon plays this move G3 and G3 is a very interesting decision because essentially it gives black the extra option to develop the light squired Bishop normally White's move C4 Cuts back Black's options black now has to decline the game or of course accept it we don't know what Ari anari would have played um but generally then you play the Catalan and you play Bishop G2 Cataline one of the best openings in chess uh especially at the master and early Master Level uh pre-master level I should say some of you can play it as well at intermediate level you'll probably experience a little bit less benefit but essentially this move allows black to play Bishop F5 and generally the idea of Bishop F5 is Bishop G2 E6 C4 C6 and uh there's a lot of lines where white tries to Target this Pawn on B C7 black tries to defend it there's a lot of complicated uh moves here uh and um there's even a funny line Queen B6 C5 Queen A6 and in this position this very funny move uh Bishop F1 and the idea of Bishop F1 is to Target the Queen by moving this E Pawn I think technically there's an item C3 in those lines but my point stands Hans demon throws all of that out the window Ari anari does in fact play the move Bishop to F5 playing a reverse London London is good with both colors it provided that you are able to play it and in this position Hans demon plays a move that has literally I think never been played in a serious Master game Knight to H4 uh now that is me checking uh my database for like I said a minute or two before this game uh maybe this has been played in title Tuesday it's played in some rapid games it's a very provocative move and effectively it's just saying well you're kind of a doofus for putting the bishop on F5 right the simplest point is that you're going to take the bishop you just want the bishop Bishop pair and then you're going to put this Catalan Bishop there and then you're going to play C4 that's just the point uh now if black UND develops all the way back to the home Square now you're just going to play a regular game except you have a knight on H4 and the argument is that it's actually maybe even better for white because you have an active Bishop so you'll Play Bishop G2 and if you basically argue that this Knight is bad for white you're kind of wrong cuz white is just getting the active Bishop very quickly and that Knight can come back to the center very quickly and because the Knight is absent you can play E4 much faster which is another thing you can't do with the Knight on F3 so a lot of interesting stuff here I've actually never I mean I've seen Knight H4 in similar positions but in this position tar plays Bishop E4 and as you can tell from T's time spend already on move four he's out of prep which is a really bad sign so Han shows up he surprises Arian probably kicks him under the table as well uh and uh The Rook is now hanging and essentially aran's plan here is get Hans to we weaken his King before putting the bishop back on G6 the problem is Hans knew that that was going to happen so as you can see he didn't lose any time Bishop G6 and now what white says is I will take this bishop when I want I'm going to play C4 and now we see the point the point is that you are covering a lot of squares right you're looking at Knight C3 behind the pawn you're also looking at Queen B3 which you couldn't play a move ago you're looking at E4 as well so if black takes on C4 or in a nutshell white will go for a position that looks like this and this is what white wants white will take the bishop white will develop white will go here and a worst nightmare scenario for black will be to basically allow all of that and give white this and this is very good for white white has more space more Center pawns two Bishops black has weak pawns because they have no light squired bishop and yes black has a little bit of activity but believe it or not this position despite the very weird structure is better for white a lot so that's the point all right um yeah Arian is caught out in the opening uh Hans shows up gets a nice pleasant position and now Arian thinks on the sixth move for 23 minutes and plays C5 he says you know what anything you can do I can do better let's trade all the pieces at the end of the day we'll trade the Queens your opening Advantage will be meaningless C4 C5 is a very common idea which actually occurs in many positions of the grunfeld defense the grunfeld being this and then this is not exactly accurate but right we have C4 C5 so you're trying to liquidate the entire Center black is trying to catch up to you there it is Hans now thinks too C5 took Hans out of his prep I think maybe Hans prepared DC Bishop takes Knight just to get the bishop out of there maybe E6 maybe C 6 but he did not remember his prep against C5 which is a move that tar invented over the board and now Hans spends 17 minutes on his own and decides right now is the best chance to take the bishop that's what I'm going to do and then after I take the bishop I'm going to take the pawn on D5 so Hans was basically evaluating should I take on C5 should I take on D5 should I take the bishop first so he takes the bishop first is the most forcing move he has uh I guess he also had a check but he takes on G6 take take and now probably Ari andari should play this because what that does is it puts more pressure on White's position and here I think probably Hans was spending the majority of his time there's a very interesting line here Knight C3 gamiing the pawn queen B3 targeting the pawn over here and after black goes back white can play Bishop F4 and Rook D1 and E4 and get a lot of development and basically say I have a lot of counterplay there's other lines as well that was low depth analysis meaning I'm sure that if you gave stockfish 20 minutes to come up with ideas but it would come up with something slightly better but Queen takes D5 does seem to be uh one of the better options to apply pressure but Arian plays this he plays this instead he plays C takes D4 so his idea was to mirror image capture and get Hans to play Queen D4 at which point he would play Knight C6 in between move you can't take the Knight because your queen would be hanging and then take back but Hans plays this and that seems to be the secret idea that seems to be the secret idea of the opening holding together his pawns so pawns Hans so Hans holds together E4 and D5 right Arian tries to go for it in a relatively fancy way it doesn't work out and now Hans is going to win this Pawn back on D4 so opening battle goes to Hans and now this turns into a scrap this turns into a boxing match on pant from Ari andari removing the defense of the Pawn on D5 but Han is right there with Knight to C3 and as you can see Han is not spending any time the 17 minutes he invested at this point was probably designed to counter all of that was was to counter was to find this move E4 and he out calculates in a little brief span of time uh or the 17 minutes spent on this move was just him going to the toilet or a bluff I don't know why you would bluff if you know the best move maybe it's to psychologically rattle your opponent but he goes here now he plays Knight C3 in between move before he takes the pawn back on E3 and black is stuck black is in a lot of trouble a moment ago I showed you that white likes that position with the two Bishops and the more and and the more spacious uh pawns now white has an even more spacious position because you have no Knight C6 or E6 if black plays E6 you split these pawns up and create huge weaknesses but also uh White is just preventing black from getting anything they want so now Arian spend some time and digs himself a deeper hole he plays Rook H5 and it takes 10 moves of this game even eight eight moves of this game for Hans Neeman to get a dominant and crushing position at 2650 rated chess average rating of these two opponents that is extremely rare for that to happen and Hans plays a very provocative opening very imbalanced opening Arian clearly you know spending you know quite a bit of time and just deciding I don't like anything he probably should have played E5 but then again I just told you what about the S pan situation well yeah Queen D1 you know maybe Knight D1 or King D1 and then yeah black can get this ruined structure but apparently it's just what you have to play Arian decides I'm not going to do any of that I'm going to play Rook H5 and now Hans finds a very nice idea with all of this swarming the pawn right black white can play Bishop C4 defending but if Bishop C4 the bishop becomes a Target so Hans decides how do I guard this Pawn without guarding it at all why is Gotham speaking in riddles how do I make make sure that my opponent cannot take this Pawn on the next move what is White's most forcing move in this position check and black has to block and blocking unfortunately disconnects the queen from the game and now again before you take this Pawn it's like white can make another final preparation White NOW plays G4 white goes on a mini initiative here it's a series of moves that create threats that improve your position G4 is so important because it kicks The Rook out of the game and remember now that the Rook moved black can't Castle so Black's King is going to be stranded in the center of the board and black is going to have to take his eyes off the pawn so ariari plays here and now you know that if you take this Pawn there are tactics you know that your Bishop is about to be used as a battering ram so Hans puts the the the cherry on top of this little sequence of moves and he plays Bishop all the way back to its home Square it did its job it did its job it forced a reaction Now The Rook is forced all the way home there is no other I mean you could try to play Rook H4 it sure as heck ain't doing anything on that square Rook goes back to its home square and now Huns takes the pawn and uh this is over white is completely dominating the position black has no moves forward I mean Rook H4 hardly counts these pawns are all stuck the only thing black can play is Rook C8 black can't Castle black cannot move the dark squared Bishop out because to do that you would need to move a center Pawn which would damage your pawns Ari andari is completely lost in this game after about 10 to 12 moves he plays G5 he plays G5 because he's trying to just give a pawn up to activate his dark Square Bishop he has literally nothing else that he can do Hans easy Free Pawn did he have to take no could he have just played like Queen B3 probably but it's a free Pawn it's a free pawn and black is also trying to create some threats over here so he picks up the Free Pawn so now he's up a pawn but black is trying to play you know G6 right get the bishop out understanding that that's about to happen Hans in this position plays D6 now the idea of D6 now is to soften up the dark squares so if Pawn takes D6 what you play now is something like Queen D4 threatening the Knight if the bishop goes to G7 which is part of the plan D6 is soft so you can always take it back so the idea of D6 is to get the Knight here get the queen there in the future get the bishop onto the diagonal and make it very difficult for black Arian thinks for a little bit and uh he can play a lot of things he plays Queen B6 point of Queen B6 is to Target the pawn get Hans to take to at least help you you develop also to activate on Queen B2 Queen E3 not right now but I'm just saying in the future Arian is totally busted here I mean it's it's actually incredible how powerful White's position is but you don't want to play a move like de you don't just want to kind of absent-mindedly trade because again if you play a move like Rook B1 black completely takes over the game immediately by castling this way and now white is nearly losing because White's King is in the center and white cannot Castle this way so you got to be really careful I mean sometimes we take for granted how easy and how strong these Grand how easy these Grand Masters make it look and how strong they are so Queen B6 Hans knows that's coming but he sees this and he sees the pawn hanging he plays Rook C1 which according to the engine is not the most precise move right but he spends 20 minutes he plays Rook to C1 the idea is stuff on this file could he have played Knight B5 with the idea of Knight C7 yeah potentially then black would have went Rook C8 and if Knight C7 he actually just would have went here and again it's a situation of you're running into a brick wall you're trying to do all this fancy stuff but none of it is working look he plays Rook C1 and what that does is it simply prevents long castles completely it's a nice idea and now he's talk he basically telling tar you got to take my Pawn tar says no I'm going to play A6 stopping Knight to B5 now you could maybe consider capturing because you can't Castle but no Hans is too committed to the ACT he plays Queen to D2 he's like no you got to get me I'm going to get you to take my Pawn I'm not taking your Pawn on E7 you got to take me because when you take me you destabilize your own position all right if you take me you give me a weakness you soften up the Knight over here and I get access to D5 in the future it's a very very difficult position very difficult position as black you really don't want to play this move you really don't again if you're confused why if you play this move I have take take and let's just say white plays I don't know literally anything King F2 it's a very tough position for black you're going to play Bishop C4 you're going to play H4 to defend your Bishop you're going to put your Rooks on the center line and uh everything in Black's position is very soft everything Rook D1 Bishop C4 right rookie just very tough position so it's just not going to work if you take with the pawn it's even worse cuz the queen stays on the board and now I can even play things like take take and G5 and then play Knight D5 and Knight C7 so that's also losing so E6 is what Arian chooses and he says you know what if I'm going to take this Pawn I'm going to do it in a way where my structure stays solid but that's the wrong decision because now H says you waited too long to sign the contract Rook D1 and the pawn is overprotected well sufficiently protected and now black is in serious trouble and now it's just the question of black how is Black's resistance going to be squashed are we going to play Knight E4 are we going to play Bishop C4 are we going to play Queen F4 what are we going to play well Hans begins to demonstrate first the bishop actually gets out of Black's position all right there's a lot of ways that you can try to improve this position but it's actually quite challenging to break through first the bishop steps back now the Queen's got to move will it go to A5 will it go to its home Square it does in fact go to A5 just applying a little bit more pressure on the queen side but how's white going to move here if you play Knight E4 like how are you going to trade the right pieces you can't rush with G5 either G5 just just is a nice kind of move but the Knight goes here you haven't made any progress well look at this bishop E2 what's the idea of Bishop E2 like what is Hans going to Castle what's he doing what he's doing he's a pawn up he could do whatever he wants he could slow play this he could send this to an end game black plays Knight E5 now black doesn't have to play Knight E5 black can play you know Rook C8 or something but Hans will maybe Advance with his H Pawn bring his King to safety then maybe trade some pieces black does play Knight E5 King F1 King F1 is the idea Hans conjures up a setup with his Bishops like this and then the king itself because White's position is so powerful able to walk over to G2 black plays knight uh Rook C8 setting up Knight C4 that move looks really nice by the way I got to tell you to get white to trade one of the Bishops off white still has a big Advantage but now H fights back on the C file Hans has 5 minutes he's still a pawn up it's a very Advanced Pawn in his opponent's territory but how is he going to win the game Ari andari plays Queen all the way back to d8 now of course the evaluation is very high but where's the win the Knight goes to the center we talked about this already Bo where's the win the Knight can't get in Arian plays Knight C6 back well let's keep something in mind black can't Castle because black is permanently disconnected once Hans finally finds that first Domino he's going to win this game Knight goes back to C6 and now he realizes he has H4 this is the Domino H5 H6 so for example if black just kind of shuffles and doesn't do anything white is going to play H5 let's say you take white could trade The Rook probably but let's just say we play G takes H5 you're safe the king is safe if Rook to G8 you can just go King F1 and H6 H7 and black is just running out of space there is no room there's no room to operate there's no room to do anything so H4 is a really nasty realization Arin just plays King f8 because he literally cannot do anything else he doesn't have a single piece past the third rank in his position and now Hans for good measure plays B4 which suppresses activity to these two key squares stops the knight's activity and also prevents the Bishop from taking a pawn and he can now play A4 B5 as well as put a knight on C5 team it up with a pawn here and have a friend or bring in a bishop just domination on all three sides of the board from the opening a patient game despite only have having four minutes on the clock Arian trying to play Knight F6 H dances to the other side of the board everything in his position is protected literally everything is protected every piece defends each other there is no way to defend yourself here you can play Rook B8 it's just a matter of time Knight D5 Hans grabs a second Pawn now black is hanging here in some positions right Arian plays Queen D7 Hans is now three pawns up the entire Queen side has fallen apart this is still a threat the Knight takes on B4 now he just has to find he just has to find his way he has four minutes to do it your Bishop is hanging it guards your knight it's a little bit complicated but black is not playing with connected Rooks that is the major difference when black takes the Rook white is getting an immediate Rook replacement black doesn't have that luxury Rook C8 and there we go and this Rook is just stuck absolutely stuck Queen D7 and every good position always has a hidden weapon and there it is Rook to C7 sacrificing The Rook point is if you just move your queen the pawn promotes and um if you if you take before I take back before I take back I play Knight C5 and you may be wondering what's the point the point is the queen is trapped if Queen here Bishop B7 traps the queen if Queen B5 then of course I just make a queen but the point is that the queen has to guard the pawn on C7 so the queen is just stranded it goes to d8 Bishop G5 and Ari andari resigns because this is hanging that's under Fire The Queen Is Under Fire and yeah he could have lasted maybe one more move with F6 but then we would have gotten takes Queen takes D2 check Bishop takes D2 the king would have moved to prevent promotion but all of this and this Rook never got a chance to participate in this game this is a crazy game from start to finish Hans wins a a a a brilliancy in this one he uh plays a really offbeat opening plays something that I've never seen before but Magnus has played uh like this couple of months ago he played um something kind of similar not exactly but he had a lot of Pawns on G3 F3 and so on uh but this is just a very very unique opening idea with C4 Arian tried to make it spicy and liquidate things early but he missed this key defensive resource for white after which the game is Just effectively over for black black has a really difficult position he needed to play E5 faster but it spiraled out of control basically immediately and after 10 moves it was already over so rare to see uh players at this level to to do this to one another but of course when Hans nean plays crazy stuff happens uh and uh yeah he's a he's an exciting player for sure he's always putting on these types of games and sometimes they go his way sometimes they completely don't this one was an example of a completely did go his way and we'll see how the rest of the tournament shapes out uh great game great game and I will see you uh for continued coverage of his tournament depending on how some of his games go now uh get out of here
