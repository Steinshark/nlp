feel like i need to do a little disclaimer 
on this video here before we fully get into   what is the metaverse what is web3 i don't want 
to see a bunch of the comments being like it's   such a stupid thing why are you even talking about 
birds i don't know where that voice came from but   i understand there are a lot of people who are 
super for this and are super against this now   i'm not here to tell you what is right and what is 
wrong what i am for what i'm against i'm just here   to share with you the information so whether 
you are for or against the metaphors and web   3. i think right now we just all need to be in a 
stage of education learning exactly what are these   platforms what are we speaking about what are 
people speaking about when they say web3 what are   they speaking about when they say metaverse and 
from there make an educated decision on if you're   into it or if you aren't there isn't one right way 
or one wrong way but i think people are just being   really close-minded and just shutting things down 
really quickly without even understanding exactly   what they are so today we are going to do just 
that talk about what is the metaverse and web3   before we get into it though make sure to hit that 
subscribe button for more tech encoding related   videos leave in the comments other videos you 
want to see and okay let's just get right into it so no surprise this whole video was based on 
there's been so much hype and talk recently   around the metaverse and web3 and blockchain and 
crypto and i can keep on going on and on and a lot   of people are like what the heck this is terrible 
and a lot of people are like this is amazing   and i'm just over here in the camp of i just 
want to learn more so that's what we're doing   today and i also want to say i'm still learning so 
it's not that i'm an expert at this but i'm just   when there is so much hype and so much 
talk and so much millions and billions   being invested into this i want to know what's 
going on so let's start with the metaverse the   concept of a metaverse of spending time online 
in a virtual world isn't really something new   think about the platforms we already have where 
we do just that whether you're you are someone   on roblox maybe you know someone roblox or 
even fortnite building characters um then   living in this virtual world it's not really a new 
concept so why all of a sudden is this becoming so   controversial and so hyped up well i think for one 
because people are scared because when you think   of a metaverse and people start talking about 
living and working in the metaverse it can freak   you out because it's like am i going to spend all 
my life all my days all my hours online or like   making virtual friends i want to live in the real 
world and i think that's one of the areas people   get really freaked out about the metaverse okay so 
the metaverse when you think of it you can think   that technologies that make up the metaverse can 
include virtual reality um virtual worlds that   exist that continue to exist i should say even 
when you're not playing even when you're not   part of it so typically when we think metaverse 
as of recently anyways we think of ar a lot we   think of putting on the goggles and going into 
this virtual world but as i mentioned it doesn't   have to be accessed that way for example once 
again fortnight and roblox also when we think of   metaverse you can think of the ways that it will 
translate into the digital uh economy where users   can buy create and sell goods you know for example 
nike just got on board and bought a company   for virtual shoes actually and i think they didn't 
actually announce how much they spent on it but   all these big companies adidas being another 
one fashion companies are getting into   virtual clothing because as there are more 
people getting into the metaverse they are   going to want to dress their characters address 
their mini me or whatever you want to call them   very stylish and this is a huge economy but the 
reality is and i think it's more important than   anything to keep in mind no one really well i 
shouldn't say no one i'm sure some people do but   the average person doesn't really know what 
the metaverse when we speak about it like this   is fully going to look like there what we know at 
this point in time is there are tons of companies   investing millions and millions of dollars into 
this to kind of see what will happen in it for   example facebook or sorry let's rephrase that 
meta thinks that it might mean including fake   houses where you can invite your friends to 
hang out whereas microsoft seems to think   it could involve more virtual meeting rooms so 
at this point i think the term is still really   vague and being explored now i'm not saying you 
need to be an expert on what the metaverse is   but even having an understanding virtual world why 
would people want to do this especially as we are   being more remote and working from home and 
isolated it might be nice in a way to feel part   of your office again by going in the metaverse 
and having those virtual meetings just saying   okay now that we've kind of covered what the 
metaverse is let's talk about the blockchain   but before we do that i need to get some tea where 
is some tea over here actually maybe some coffee okay i'm back how do you get some coffee 
you know it's just been like a long   long long day but it hasn't been that bad today 
i've been talking to you so it's been good   but um as you can see it is so snowy outside 
and just like crazy crazy cold so welcome to   canada okay let's get back to it the question 
we were answering is what is web3 so i have   some notes here on it because as i said i'm not an 
expert i'm still learning but i think it's really   important to just like talk through this and learn 
together so on my notes here i have web3 refers to   a potential new iteration of the internet internet 
that runs on public blockchain so what exactly it   means from my understanding is when it's running 
on blockchain it's decentralized which means   users can access the internet for themselves they 
don't need to go through these big companies such   as google apple facebook whereas they can just 
go on their own terms and also too you can think   of it about the data collection side so web3 
would protect you more so from the data side   by being able to have better privacy not have to 
go through all the permissions of oh i accept all   these permission permissions from facebook or from 
whatever company it is versus it's decentralized   no one owns it and no one is taking that data from 
you of course let's let's be real at this point   there is no necessarily web3 that we can access 
it's just a concept that is going to be a reality   very soon um and kind of thinking about from a 
perspective of blockchain developers so so many   blockchain developers really see a future with 
this a better future with this there are a lot   of drawbacks or negatives to it as well so i'm not 
saying that web3 is the end-all feel but rather   an alternative and also too it's really important 
to note that when web3 comes around it's not just   going to replace what we currently have but i 
really believe it will run alongside of it you   can't completely get rid of um the current web 
and how we currently use systems but rather it   will slowly over time be integrated okay but 
one of my questions i had is what came before   web 3 like what is web 2 and what is web one so i 
have notes here about that as well so web one uh   covers you know the 90s and the early 2000s which 
was more decentralized and um really was more open   source and then what came along is what we have 
now which is web 2. and when you think of web   2 you can think of it more so as the internet 
today how did you search something online well   you probably used a big company such as google 
to do so how did you speak to your friends online   well you probably used a big company such as 
facebook to do so or the metaverse um different   things like that that's what we currently have 
now our big companies really run the web so it   only makes sense that there's going to be another 
portion to this and something else will come along coffee coffee what they say the liquid drink the 
drink of programmers it's very true i drink a lot   of coffee okay and then the last question i had 
is what does web 3 really have to do with the   metaverse like why are they talking about both 
of these so much and a lot of technologists are   saying that web3 will really help incubate the 
metaverse or contain a metaverse that is ran on   the decentralized blockchain so the metaverse 
would be run by a network of computers around   the world rather than a few big companies which 
when you think about the metaverse and you think   of the few big companies that could run it it's 
terrifying whereas if you think if it was more   so built on web 3 or with web 3 it's way less 
intimidating it seems like okay this could be a   lot more friendly and less of these tech companies 
kind of controlling our data and everything we   do okay so that is from what i've learned so far 
the metaverse and web3 and once again this video   isn't to convince you it's a good thing or bad 
thing it's just to share with you information of   what these two these two things are these 
two buzzwords really are and what the   potential for them are i hope you found 
this video really helpful and insightful   and also really friendly i didn't want to 
make this video and it become across as very   static or dry but rather just some information 
that i would share with a friend as i'm continuing   to learn about it as well i'm curious to know
