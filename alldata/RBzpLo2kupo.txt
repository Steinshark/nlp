so Unity has gone on and they've said some sort of apologizing that's going on and uh people have a lot of opinions about it we got ingn writing about it we also have these three or this video with someone owing 5.6 million dollars based on the new API changes and then lastly there's these three videos that all kind of cover the same concept we'll look at this one right here because it seems like the unity stuff it only keeps getting worse so let's start with this one because this one perhaps is the most interesting all right yesterday I talked about the fall of unity and today I'm talking about it again why because it continues to get much much worse the picture continues to change and because I'm now fascinated by it long story short watching a company implode like this and scratching my head as to why makes me want to figure it all out if not for certain then at least plausible speculation on what the reasons might be the secret agendas or the hidden motivations do you think they made that animation in unity it would also be a crime doing this is actually a federal crime by the way I'm not gonna bore everyone with a lengthy recap of stuff they've already heard because most people probably understand the gist of it already however the Crux of the issue is this Unity technology is a video game software company responsible for making the unity game engine has recently adjusted their fee structure on top of a flat Subscription Service they will now charge game developers per install with retroactive terms of service changes and that monetization scheme will have a severe negative impact on a great deal of projects yep going further they deliberately pulled so so before we go on with that one actually I think it's a good time to take a quick like a pull out really quickly and jump over to this guy so this guy makes this extremely long tweet thread where he talks about how he worked on some of the iterations of the early ago year ago price change and how this one what's happening right here is completely different than what he originally worked on and here's the whole dilemma but he does make one point that's kind of in some sense maybe interesting which he is he is claiming that this that 95 percent of all game developers will actually have a cheaper experience with the per install than the royalty of Unreal Engine and that's because Unreal Engine is about a five percent cap rate or a five percent not cap rate uh five percent uh money making fee but I think one thing that's kind of missing from this which it really is the core of all this is install doesn't mean you mean you made any money it means you've made zero dollars and they're taking money whereas royalty you've already made money five percent of what I've already made is much different than 20 cents on zero dollars made and so I think this is you know even this explanation that is trying to like give a light to everything I still think it's missing that one big difference which is that per game download installed they hope with their magical algorithm in which they haven't expressed on that it's just gonna be fine but it's very interesting that I mean that's where we're at that's what's happening down their own transparency GitHub repo dragon and me personally I think that having a fee on money I've made is more reliable and understandable than a fee on on user activity right I think it's just really hard to even qualify why that's a better plan even if it is even if it is in 95 percent of the cases more money making right even if in 95 of the cases you will make more money with the per install than a royalty it still seems crazy changes like this and reverse a number of commitments from years prior about having the best interests of a community at heart in essence they destroyed the totality of their Goodwill jeopardized a multitude of projects angered the entire industry top to bottom and they did all of it for what more money sure the CEO is an industry Paragon of how to squeeze more money from an audience I discussed that last time but deeper than that EA CEO for those that don't know also EA just really hasn't been making a lot of great games it seems like there must be something more Sinister happening avoiding the topics I focused on last time you can just go watch the prior video if you want to hear about those let's take a look at the board of directors we already know about John risottiello however you say that the CEO he sold a bit of stock right before this all happened he was the former CEO at EA Games he wanted to charge Gamers per reload In the Heat of the Moment when price aversion was lowest and the industry hates him for good reason but who's this guy Tomar barzieve credit where credit is due tugging on this thread is the result of a post on r slash Unity from a user named zijit I'll link to that down below Tomar barzie is on the board of directors at Unity but he is also the CEO of a company called iron Source now iron Source itself is an important piece of the potential puzzle because iron Source actually merged in November of 2022 with unity Technologies this at the time was a 4.4 billion dollar deal pretty big but the landscape surrounding that deal is what matters most for reference iron source is a company that specializes in mobile game development monetization and distribution okay ads a lot of ads right isn't that like one of the big ones is just a whole bunch of ads you know it's kind of funny all the people that run video game stuff seem like they've never played a video game in their life you know what happened to the old days of Blizzard the by the the bygone days of yore where they actually like used their own product you know like it's crazy like as a developer it would be crazy for me not to use Netflix I work at Netflix by the way just in case you're wondering would it be crazy of me to do that right like it would be an expectation that I understand how Netflix works and what is good and bad right like it'd be crazy and so like what are all these people that are running these companies that have never even used their own product it just feels completely it feels crazy that's the only way yeah dog food you should always dog food okay so Tamar barzie sitting on the board of directors at Unity Technologies and also CEO of iron source is a figure of interest but it turns out that when you go down the list of unity insiders who are selling stock in the company this guy is by far the most aggressive over the past year alone according to fintel it appears that Tomar barzie has sold upwards of 20 million dollars in unity stock which is interesting to say the very least now remember that 4.4 again I I typically don't like some of these these points that is being made when people talk about like Insider selling because often these things they have to be put in months in advance we're talking about a long time he just got his company built he or bought and he probably got the company in unity shares and he's trying to cash out on the shares themselves I typically don't like that as like all the follow the trail right like it doesn't necessarily mean something good or bad potentially I'm not saying it's all that it can be that but it doesn't always mean that a billion dollar merger between Unity Technologies and iron Source well it turns out that deal had a number of shall we say complications first at the same time is this 4.4 billion dollar deal or merger was taking place a company called app Lovin made a competing offer to buy out Unity completely for 20 billion dollars but Unity rejected this deal citing that the deal quote would not reasonably be expected to result in a superior proposal end quote I find that exceptionally odd on a personal level given that the comparable market capitalization at the time was significantly below 20 billion dollars making this an offer that came with a sizable upside where's the where's the where's the the old market cap why don't I I can't I don't know how to use this one I don't use this this website where's where where it ends market caps at am I blind here uh Unity stock here just Google has a better one Unity stock all right just give me the just give me the meat what's their market cap okay 12. okay so it's about the same price 12. I can't use Yahoo finance it's impossible for me to use because it's it's made of actual Magic it's made of magic and things I can't understand okay so they're at 12. so yeah 20 would be pretty good 20 would boost them up to like what 45 50 45 yeah 45 something like that okay still the deal with iron Source would leave unity in control while the deal with app loving would reduce them to 49 voting rights so yeah it's a bit complicated and they rejected the offer anyway after rejecting app love and unity merged with iron source and now the CEO of iron Source Tomar barziev as we've said sells tens of millions of dollars worth of stock while the company just sold this company he wants to make some money baby he destroys every shred of community Goodwill that it has but it gets better during the deal with iron Source two investment companies Sequoia capital and Silver Lake pledged to come on board with a billion dollars invested in the deal itself that's honestly peanuts compared to app Lovin but when the deal eventually did come through two more people one from each of those companies joined unity's board of directors aegon Durbin and roldaf bother Deez Nuts starting with aegon Durbin absolutely love that just absolutely hands down love that again I still don't believe that these two investors coming in I don't believe they play video games or understand game development they just want to make billions of dollars he is a founding principal and managing director at Silver Lake which it now appears I  you not has sold the entirety of their directly held remaining stock in unity Technologies disclosed as of yesterday also aegon Durbin once again big shout out to zijit why would you want anyone on the board to have no stock is that not crazy I mean that feels like a psyop just waiting to happen like hey what are you doing um we don't own any stock what are you doing at this board meeting we're going to help you run your company why get out of here like why would you ever want someone on your board that has no stock yeah it sounds like an ex exit scheme yeah yeah sound sounds a little fishy but okay over on Reddit the connections here are fascinating and I wouldn't have known about half of them without their post aegon Durbin was embroiled in Scandal when he advised Elon Musk about the potential to take Tesla private that was a whole Fiasco with illegal Quagmire where Elon said he was going to take the company private and then the SEC got involved et cetera et cetera but aegon Durbin still has major ties to both Twitter and musk as shareholders attempted to oust him and failed in the wake of musk's Infamous takeover well now that we have Elon Musk in the mix once again let's Double Down aegon Durbin came on board is Elon musk's now a part of unity is this what ultimately is going to happen is that what we're saying right now through Silver Lake but Roloff Botha came on board with Sequoia capital of the yeah rollath Botha is part of what's commonly referred to as the PayPal Mafia alongside Elon Musk the PayPal Mafia for those that don't know is a list of former employees and Founders at PayPal who have since gone on to create a giant spider web of technology companies it includes names like Peter Thiel Chad Hurley co-founder of YouTube yishon Wong founder of Reddit and yes Roloff Botha a partner now at Sequoia Capital sitting on the board of directors at Unity get this in October of 2022 Roloff bother was predicting success quote unquote for Elon Musk at Twitter stating that his firm Sequoia Capital conducted due diligence and the business model can be improved but let's expand on that comparison see Twitter actually made radical changes to their API pricing okay now I I'm not gonna lie to you the unity stuff is making me really confused at this point okay I'm not I'm getting I'm we're I feel like this is getting a little deep for me to understand but we'll we'll hear about we'll let the guy cook and then we're gonna get to Unity OKAY model not long after completely lost and those changes are not dissimilar to those of unity personally I ran up against this when trying to map these huge I'm not sure if Twitter is anything like Unity political bot networks with my team and now I can't do that because I got locked out of the API based on those changes and I can't afford to pay thousands of dollars per month to do it hosting costs have long been the elephant in the room for tech companies the more traffic you get the more expensive it is and Twitter decided to start ruthlessly charging Developers for API requests that resulted in a lot of applications being deprecated because they just simply couldn't afford the cost being passed down to them in such a way and the trend my guess is it's actually probably more to do a chat Jeopardy that's always been my guess is that they want to make some sort of internal deal with these large AI companies that have billions of dollars and they just want to be able to be like they're just kicking everybody out and then just being like okay you want access for everything here's our price for the normal person which is like one trillion dollars and then we'll give it to you on a steal of a deal for 10 million you know what I mean or 10 billion right like to me that's that's probably the more likely the golden API key yeah that's to me that's like you know to me that seems just much more reasonable uh than I I'm more of a simple individual when it comes to uh when it comes to these these really complicated conspiracies it really has to be one dimensional because I doubt people can go beyond that you know what I mean uh they made uh TOS changes okay yeah that's what Unity is trying to do it seems like Indy's trying to do something different because I can't make such a simple judgment on how does runtime fee equate to musk effectively pricing out any hobbyist from using Twitter API you know what I mean like for me that's that's where that's where I can't do this let's let them cook because honestly I cannot follow this okay I can't follow this yet read it much like Twitter went down a very similar route option to start again chat GPD I think this is a very simple chat GPT one how are you gonna make a whole bunch of money jack up your API sell it to open eye AI spontaneously charging for API usage series oh Steve Huffman is on record praising Elon musk's new monetization tactics for Twitter as a platform explicitly saying that their conversations had been inspiring for him Flash Forward to one last thing the increased amount of ads and then paying people to tweet I think has done more for engagement and twittering as far as monetization goes than for them increasing the price of their API just throwing it out there I think that's where the real play is is you want every single content creator ever to be on Twitter because they will pay you to do what you're already doing on the other platforms I think that that's more of a reason for people to be on these platforms than than anything else right I think that's I think that's what they're attempting to do today and we now see Unity opting to continue that very same Trend logistically protecting game developers from Bad actors will now be completely impossible because every time you spin up a virtual machine it's a brand new install right and they have no way to differentiate that and you could easily Target developers if you wanted to but focusing on the Casual mobile game Market remember Unity accepted an iron Source merger at 4.4 billion instead of a merch that guy has pretty much never used his pinky and I want everyone to look at this for a second there's something really bizarre about someone using our keyboard that long without using their casual mobile game Market what are you doing Unity accepted an iron Source merger at 4.4 billion where is your instead of emergency with app loving they're valued at 20 billion what are you hey focusing on the Casual mobile market we see this right here Unity is offering a runtime fee waiver if you switch to level play as it tries to kill applevin would you look at that level play is a service from Iron Source here's a much better visualization of what's actually happening from a username on Twitter the yellow indicates the portion of developers will now lose between 10 and 25 of their revenue with unity's new terms of service okay orange they stand to lose between 25 and 50 of their revenue red can lose between 50 and 100 and that scary black line off to the left not huge but it is there that's the area where these new terms will bankrupt your company because Unity decided to charge you more money per install than your app is even making I would say the 50 to 100 one also probably will just bankrupt you as well I will take all of your money now okay thanks please really even the Orange is pretty much your bankrupt everything right here is pretty much bankrupt this is like borderline bankruptcy I mean what what is the what is the the gross margin on these games is probably not even that high right we're mostly talking about small-scale free mobile applications and games but even if I have my gripes with the mobile game Market those people still have jobs and deserve fair treatment let's go big picture here Unity is being raped over the coals rightly so for their decision to implement aggressive pricing on their customer base that decision emulates a pattern that began with Twitter was mirrored by Reddit and is now making its way through the broader markets the decision itself appears to be aimed at killing a competing service after Unity actually rejected a buyout offer from that Services owner this is hacker type by the way Source who stands to gain the most from this entire controversy meanwhile the CEO of iron source and the directors who came to play a capital and Silver Lake during the deal relentlessly dumped their stocks in unity standing to gain massively as the business gets funneled into level play the vouchers that's the key anecdotes are beginning to surface right now more and more where developers are being offered runtime fee waivers to switch over and some are being told that their fees will be covered with credits because they already use iron source as their ad provider the Golden Goose here is iron source and the gaming developers being affected are just casualties of a hidden agenda thankfully there are still ways for developers to fight back as an example there was recently a collective letter from so so let me just get this straight if you don't want to pay any runtime fees you opt into Unity ads is that kind of what I'm hearing is that it was that what they were trying to say there okay I'm not gonna lie to that musk in between part I'm still really confused by because this makes a lot of sense here's the reason why it makes a lot of sense uh this actually this is a I mean really you make a completely vile intense amount of like you you make a really bad thing where people cannot afford to use it so instead you force it ads why are ads really useful the thing about ads is that people don't or like advertisement companies and when you do these Mass ad things is that you it's really hard to start an ads company unless if you can get rid of literally billions of hours of ads like that you really can't get into these ad advertisement rings and so it's a very very very important kind of uh thing to understand about the ads Market it's very very important a lot of people do not know that about the ads Market that's why YouTube can be very successful and other companies can't be because they can't actually get into these ad Gardens and so therefore Unity kind of forcing a bunch of developers to say hey we'll start using ads and then now all those developers each have millions of people using it they can kind of make this really compelling argument that they're going to have an ads Network that will actually make money right again I'm just I'm just giving like the most non-conspiracy take here ever which is this seems like an ads play this just again just seems like ads like why aren't we always just going to Occam's razor and saying where are the ads that's all you really gotta do for any of these conspiracy and say who's showing what ads to me this actually seems worse right uh well when I say worse I mean this is just terrible like forcing a bunch of ads on people because I don't want to do that you know what I mean I don't want to watch a bunch of ads yeah you get a yeah you get an instantaneous uh ad network if you can just force all these developers onto ads and that's going to be literally billions of dollars Occam's razor is a dick salad it always ends in dick salad that's the worst part about Occam's razor is it always is oh did someone say pirate software is here pirate software are you here I'd actually love to hear pirate softwares pirate software are you here I'd love to actually hear your opinion on this yeah you're gonna do stuff man this is this is some wild stuff to watch um I'm pretty upset watching Unity do this to be real because there's such a pillar of the Indie Dev community and of game Devon in general for those of you who don't know me my name is Thor I've been in the gaming industry for about 20 years I used to work at Blizzard Entertainment then I worked for Amazon game studios then the United States Department of energy I'm a hacker pen tester so the last job I had was hacking power plants for the Federal Government after that I quit started my own game studio called pirate software and now I'm at games here on Twitch I've actually been streaming here full time now for about six years in fact this category exists because I screamed to Twitch for eight months and then the community rallied around and everyone bitched until twitch finally actually made the category so like I've been here been here a while right yeah you've been here longer than I have there's only been a there's only a few people that have been here longer than me it's like you and Lana Lux and that's pretty much it there's there's nobody else that's been here longer I stream back when we had the creative category and then they turned us into game game development then they deleted that and then put us in uh what was it a science attack okay where we all compete with the chickens the chicken yeah we were competing with the chickens and the weed growing streams those were the two those the weed growing so you I mean who could compete with or earthquakes I think earthquakes are still the earthquake one yeah there's the there's the globe with the earthquakes on it it's ridiculous so yeah that basically the unity stuff is ridiculous to me um there's a reason that the industry never goes towards a per install model ever yeah to me it seems obvious but I might be missing some key information here so so the first thing that I I think of is you know as a hacker the first thing I go is I go okay I have a rival company but they make a video game I make a video game and I want to compete with them so what I do is I wait for them to get over the 200 000 threshold which is how much you need in order for them to start hitting you with the 20 cent per download I'll wait for them to go over 200 000 downloads then I set up a shitload of servers and I use those to I randomize the MAC address maybe I randomize randomize some Hardware info and I download your game hundreds of thousands of times a day but I don't do it that fast I start really slow and I ramp that up slowly over time and your company goes bankrupt and you don't have any actual customers this is why we don't do this this is the reason that the industry has never done a pay per download Paper install kind of model because it leaves these developers open to just insane abuse and on top of it the idea from Unity that somehow they're going to be able to resolve this and say like oh we know how all these downloads happen they're only testing that they're only checking this by aggregate they don't know how these downloads are happening that means all piracy that means all fraudulent downloads that it means everybody who downloads the game deletes it and re-downloads it again you're getting charged for all of that  this is outrageously stupid I also heard that it's going to be not only that but upgrades I don't know if that's true like if you update your game it has to re-go through the whole process and thus you actually get uh so every time you do a deadbeats I didn't even realize that part no if they're doing that too on top of it that's right but that seems kind of seems kind of wild and obviously he's watching one of the stories I don't know if you're on here but we were watching a YouTube video about like kind of like the Deep it's actually a very large spider web of all these confusing things but based on the very end it just seems like the ultimate goal here is to get an ad Network and the only way to get an ad network is to force a bunch of people to show ads and it seems like this runtime fee is actually a really great Catalyst to get you to kind of be forced onto this iron Source ad Network effectively and thus they could do that to me that's like the most reasonable explanation is the craziness you know sorry yeah I was gonna say I could see that taking place the problem is this by doing that on an a per install basis for this it doesn't help them build that ad Network any better frankly it it doesn't it just alienates all of their current users it alienates the Triple A's and Aliens the idiot like Indies and it alienates the platforms too I don't know if you saw what this means for Steam and Microsoft yeah they get they all get charged effectively it gets bypassed to them which I mean you could argue that the piracy slash uh the the kind of like uh denial of wallet attacks probably don't exist as much on those services or as at least as easily but nonetheless yeah imagine how Microsoft's going to handle that though imagine if they go you know what we don't want you on Game Pass because you're a unity game that's the that's the direction that goes because it ends up being a liability and ends up being a Financial Risk to these platforms to do this which means they don't want to work with your studio and that means more people aren't going to want to work the engine and then more jobs are getting like jobs are going to be lost for that there's tons of people that I know that have been working in unity since the beginning right yeah and they're like I don't know if I'm gonna have a job anymore because no one's going to want to use this engine that's not the direction it should go if Unity really wanted to make more money and create this kind of like environment where they could run more ads and things like this and maybe generate more Revenue because they're running the business in a direction without making enough rev sure would have been the way and it's no one would be happy about it they wouldn't be happy about a REV share system but cost for install that's insane it makes no sense there's something that's like really emotionally bruising about getting charged on something in which you don't make money versus no one wants to be a part of rev share but if I had to choose the two it just seems like rev share would be the natural way to avoid any sort of like entanglements whereas the other one like that's a huge mystery like kid games I don't want ads in kid games uh and I don't want monetization in kids games I want to pay my two dollars or whatever for the game and that's like an instantaneous somewhere between you know ten to one percent of their money just going away instantaneously depending if they're on personal or Enterprise oh yeah there was actually um there was a developer that was talking about that they're a phone developer phone game developer and they um they make kids games and they have about 102 million downloads in total so big amount of downloads right very popular and they said specifically they don't run ads in in their children's games because they don't want to run ads to kids and they think it's gross they've made about a million dollars exactly they've made about a million dollars in micro transactions off of their game so they do have microtransactions involved with that but they have over a hundred million downloads which means they would have paid Unity more than the total income of their game in fees for downloads that's a a game engine development company should never be defining the business model of the studios Downstream that's the end of that that Unity should not be able to define the way that we do business as game developers with the community ever at all and that's exactly what they're doing with this change and it's insane frankly so what would be the best outcome for all this like what can Unity ever ate you got earn trust back right how do they walk this back but really what is the way for them to go forward where they feel like they should be able to make or they feel like they're not getting the money out because I I also understand some of their arguments where charging per seat probably was never the best model to begin with it probably is a very hard model to actually really make enough money to kind of justify the amount of Engineers you need to maintain Unity which is a decent amount of Engineers like let's be real Unity has made an incredible product literally but it's costing them probably what a 100 plus million a year to develop 200 plus million a year to develop I don't know how much but probably a ton well you also have to remember there's a lot of money that goes into Unity from these major developers too as side Channel stuff like when I worked at blizzard and they were making Hearthstone hearthstone's original version was actually built in Flash and they eventually moved over to Unity and while it was getting developed in unity for that after that prototype form that was actually they gave a ton of money to Unity to develop additional features to make it so that Unity was good enough for them to be able to release Hearthstone in so like there is extra money that goes into Unity from these different types of business deals that we don't generally see right so we do have to think about that but on top of it I think the best way they could handle this situation roll this back do not have a price per install because you're just going to open up new abuse you're gonna you're gonna damage all these Studios and you're gonna try and Define the market for different ways of monetization do a REV share model rev sure model is going to be unsavory it will be absolutely but it's not going to be absolutely cataclysmic like this it would be gross people would not be happy about it but I think the bigger thing is you talked about earning back trust that's going to be really hard to do no matter what and I think the reason why is because it did you see what they did with their GitHub did you see that or no I haven't seen that yet hold on just one second hold on one second sure uh I'm gonna also pull in Casey moratori is that fine all right just uh sorry first off my camera does not actually work right now all right so let's just go to my camera my camera is down uh so second off hey we just brought on Casey moratori Casey can you tell us a little quick something about you so people know what you do why you're awesome to have on here oh why am I oh gosh well that's not gonna happen uh I'd have to make up something but uh the who I am I I've been in the game industry since gosh 1995 I guess uh most of my time was doing uh game development tools so actually back in you know the late 90s and early 2000s I actually worked on exactly the kinds of things that Unity does at that time licensing engines was not really as open of a thing it usually was like you license from you know ID software or from epic directly or that sort of thing but I worked on one of the few companies that was a sort of like more open middleware company it's called rad game tools they are now amusingly a part of Epic just a few years ago they they actually merged into epic because actually Jeff and Tim are friends um So eventually that just became something and Jeff's getting pretty old too so he's like you know the rad was kind of a company that was a small a smaller company and they kind of wanted to eventually figure out what they were going to do with other stuff but they're they're the people who make like the  video player which is like every games video player and you know Telemetry kind of stuff they make technology they also make oodle which is the compressor that for example was licensed for the PS5 it's the one that's built into the PS5 Hardware so they're like a really you know great game tech company or I should say we're and now they're part of Epic um nice and so uh like the unity thing I've been following for a while actually because uh this was my old business this was basically what I used to do uh for you know very I guess probably totally 10 years maybe something like that which is pretty long time in this industry and I I kind of knew that Unity second economics didn't really make any sense and so when they went public uh I was watching them the whole time I've been reading their investor uh stuff I've been watching you know their stock I've been watching what they say they're in what they report for financials and it looked awful um and so you can go back and find tweets from me from you know year two years back actually saying you know I wouldn't use this engine I think if you can switch you should switch from this engine because I'm like bad things are coming because they have to figure out a way to justify their valuation and what they've been telling investors and their per seat licensing model right now is not going to do that right like they're they don't have a path to profitability right now and if you look at their revenue breakdown it's it's actually over 50 ads at the time uh and so so it was a very dire situation going into it I knew this would happen and uh the first thing that happened was they merged with iron source which a lot of people were upset about already because iron Source has a bad reputation they were an advertising company uh that was accused of Distributing malware basically so they merged with iron source and that was kind of the first sign that's like yep things are starting to go a little bit sour that's probably not something you would normally do if you were just a game engine company and interested in good reputation with your developers and so on and then now we're getting this particular uh incident which is again a lot more scary for developers because it involves retroactive changes to what developers thought was going to happen in other words what when they signed up with unity and even if they've already completed their games Unity is kind of like changing the deal on them now this is a lot worse than the iron Source merger in terms of things that might be scary and I honestly am afraid this is probably not the end of it right I don't think this is going to be the the last thing so anyway that's a just a brief recap of why I'm particularly interested in this so yeah I think the big thing for me is is he was talking a little bit about getting um people back on like you know trusting in unity one of the things that they changed and actually I tweeted out about this uh today is they had a GitHub and the GitHub was specifically set up for them to talk about their terms of service since 2019 and that terms of service was any changes they put forward they put it out on there and then everyone reviews it and then they approve it and it goes forward they deleted that GitHub during the scroll up it's literally 404 now I'm gonna link that to you guys in chat yeah okay I I have it right now they actually just completely deleted the whole thing yep they for afford the entire thing I actually I sent you the tweet in DMS on Twitter and I just put the link to the actual uh GitHub right there in chat so like when you're talking about them earning back trust dude they they this was intentional like they knew people were going to be pissed off about this they sh they out right at the last second they deleted the GitHub for this like this is a terrible move man there's also there's employees complaining about it as well saying that they they said for months that they were against this and one of them actually quit let me go pull that guy up real fast yes there there have been multiple employees that have complained about this saying they argued against it internally so so I've heard a couple takes especially now which is hey again my camera's still broken but that we should like you should you shouldn't have any sympathy for any of the employees because they still work at Unity how do you guys feel about those kind of takes in that kind of sense no I don't think so at all I don't think that that makes any sense um and just because you're an employee for a company doesn't mean that you align your goals with all of the movements of that company a lot of things are decided at the executive level it's very clear that many of the employees did not know this was coming or or stood against it it's that's not that is there's no reason to be mad at Unity employees and I know the internet can be like a gross Hate Machine sometimes and go after people that are just associated with the company and as an example of this I helped launch Diablo 3. that was a show like when we first launched that it was a nightmare and the error 37 thing was crazy and like people yelled at me I was in QA at the time it's not my fault that the game was bad right and the same thing's gonna happen to Unity employees it's not acceptable you shouldn't do it and I would point out that when you're getting mad at employees of a company you have to be pretty certain that you know who you're getting mad at because you know some people like for example the CEO it's probably pretty okay to be mad at them because they're the ones who have decision making you know some decision to make Authority but also they're the ones who are they're wealthy they they could leave they could leave the company if it was doing something unscrupulous but if you look at somebody who's you know needs to make a living uh they they don't have the opportunity it and an average worker at a company doesn't have the opportunity to just quit I mean they might have a family to feed they they might need the job right so you can't get mad at someone from sticking with a company they may not even want to stick at that company for all you know yeah they just might have to because that's their living so you have to be very careful if you're getting uh mad at somebody associated with the company if you want to get mad at someone very high up who obviously could have done something or obviously could have left that's one thing if you're getting mad at somebody who's like just a worker at a company that's you should probably shouldn't do that yeah aside from that you don't know if that person is now applying elsewhere they may have found out about it immediately yeah they may be like okay I'm getting out of here but they're still stuck there for the time being you can't just switch jobs in 48 hours most of the time dude it like takes a while and I would assume that they're you know if you've all you've ever done is say work on a the editor for Unity like that's a pretty narrow uh you know experience Gap you can be like yes I'm very very good at building a 3D editor you know he's like okay how many positions of that specific like you can't just ask people to upend their life instantaneously just because you get upset because you know Netflix does some things I'm not super proud of but at the exact same time I don't want to just leave the company because hey I also get a voice in some of these things I can actually ask questions I can actually push some of the the higher Suite people and you can actually make or help at least get the idea out there that other people think differently by being an employee there so it's not just purely if you're there you support it or if you're not there you showed how virtuous you were by quitting or whatever the you know whatever the the expectation of did you see the Tweet by Joan of Forbes that I sent you by the way no you want to just throw it in the twitch chat it's easiest if we keep it in the twitch chat just because I'm showing the Twitter so you guys can have it um it's right there in chat so what Jonah said is they said as a Unity employee until this morning I assure you we fought like hell against this brought up all points everyone has we're told answers were coming and then the announcement went out without warning those of us who care are out more resignations coming end of this week and Jonah Forbes was the XR workflow's lead at Unity so like these aren't just like small time people these are quite a lot of their developers that are talking out about this so there were employees that got blindsided so attacking employees makes no sense yeah absolutely none I I would like to uh sort of use something you just said Prime actually to talk about another issue here that I think is important just because there's a ton one of the reasons like when you sent me the DM I was like yes I would love to talk about Unity because it's a ton of things to talk about and I've posted some things about it but other things are just better yes I have this post by you I was actually going to read here shortly which I thought was a pretty cool kind of rundown me and actually some people uh internally at my company were talking about the situation and your post was being floated around as one of the let me add some more takes to that because there's a lot here to unpack and this is why I kind of wanted to talk about it so one thing I'd like to talk about is effectively uh Unity to my mind and again like I you know it everything here is just my opinion so take take it uh you know at for what it's worth but they more or less ran an engine dumping scheme that is how unity's business model was set up they offered a engine well below the cost it was costing them to actually build it for the past and years because they had effectively a free tier where lots of people were not paying anything for the engine then they you know were operating at a huge loss so even those people who were paying weren't making up the entire cost so what that means is they're also they were basically distorting the market right they were they were trying to build up this huge customer base at a loss and when companies do that there has to be a switch at the end there has to be a plan right and so the reason that again I was so worried about this is because if you look at business models like that the the chickens come home to roost at some point so when you're creating this Market Distortion and building up a large user base by giving people something at cheaper than what it's actually costing you to make it at some point you know they're going to come and ask for more because they have to right they can't keep doing that and so you see companies that have done this like Uber or something like that eventually it's like the cost of rides is gonna go up that's just what's gonna happen because these things you know don't get any cheaper at scale they're already at that scale right so yes from somewhere you're losing money continuously it's not like you make money on three if you're losing money on one either make money to begin with you're just not making enough to pay the development staff or you're not making money and it's not going to work no matter how many people are there and if they were just you know if they were like well we're only we only have 500 customers and we think we can get that to 5 000 customers and so that's where we think the extra money is like no they were already pretty much as big as they could be in like sort of the game engine space and so what this is why I said when you look at their investor uh material stuff like that what were they talking about growing their advertising market right which was a big thing they were talking about expanding into verticals now expanding it to verticals means doing non-game stuff that requires again more r d it costs to get into that space you also have to start thinking about other concerns the engine might get worse for gaming because you're focusing on doing Hollywood effects with it you're focusing on architectural walkthrough you're focusing on product previews you're focusing on digital twin all these other things right I think that's something a lot of people don't realize too is that Unity is not just use for games it's used for a ton of other stuff so it was Unreal it's it's used for a ton of different things so like it's this is not just impacting the game development environment like it is but it's not the only it's not the only victim here exactly and so I think it's just it's worth noting like this is why this is just a really difficult situation and even if you know this this is a huge backlash that's happening so even if they walk a little bit of this back I don't see this situation improving because what are they going to do like they're going to come back at you with something nasty and my hope is that maybe they like the only real outcome can see here that's positive for everybody and it's not even it's not positive for a certain segment of their employees it's not positive but is if they massively reduce their spending so they they cut a lot of like sales and marketing and and r d into other things and then just charge a more reasonable per seat price like instead of having a free tier they have to like raise that or stuff like that and then they get to uh an actual profitable company even that though their valuation is just waste still way too high is the problem when you're talking about this Percy license they actually remove their low end fursuit license in this change did you see that the free tier is gone no not the free tier the one just above that there was there was unity plus and unity Pro and unity plus was 400 per seat per year but you could only do it after a hundred thousand dollars to up to two hundred thousand dollars they removed that it's gone now so yes there's no middle ground anymore I don't know I don't get it so I have another kind of A Wrinkle to kind of think about with a lot of this uh is that there's a lot of people you know there's there's more and more kind of streaming of of game and all this that is kind of going down now how does this all work with people that are using Unity as an engine to stream games out to people to play in real time how does that uh do you know how that kind of charging structure or anything like that's going to go because because now you have like a whole another kind of class of charging which is it's not quite a distributable like Microsoft so the you know the per seat doesn't make any sense because there could be one or two people using it you can't you don't have an install because it's being streamed out what's the so when you're talking about a streamed out do you mean like the web browser-based ones where like you just yeah they're actually live it was actually under their new model that actually counts as an install if you saw so every time someone goes to play it in the browser that counts as an install so you just leave the page come back leave the page come back and that's not a joke that's terrible but that is what it is so yeah oh yeah enjoy that they've managed to make quite a few uh I mean they really found some Revenue potential I'll I'll say that much when they're when no one's using the engine I don't know if that's true here's a here's the thing I just want to add to this uh because I again I really don't know but when I was trying to think through why would they do it this way like why would they use this install fee thing and there's a couple theories right one theory is that this was an attempt to try and effectively extort uh mobile game and like ad based gaming uh or ad ad based anything Revenue to go away from App 11 and onto Unity uh unity's ad platform right yeah so I don't know if you've seen that people that makes the most sense of the reasonable one so that's when Chad said they actually rolled back the web uh install thing that I was talking about so I'm asking them for a link of that because yeah the original one was if they if they stream it if they see it on the web browser account this is an install which was just insane to look at uh so so there's like the App 11 thing and applevin's uh actual like CEO or president or whatever their head guy is there because I don't know much about that company uh actually posted about this like and said like if this is a direct targeted thing at us we think that's really uh misguided and unity you shouldn't do it so that's one Theory I have another thing that I would add to that mix though and that is that Unity has made many public statements in the past about how they weren't going to have royalties and their actual like terms of service had things in it that said for example that they could change the fee structure but didn't say anything about adding uh like Revenue shares or royalties and so one thing I'm wondering because in you know my my legal brain starts kind of getting suspicious at that point one thing I'm wondering is did they have to come up with a way to effectively charge a royalty in the disguise of a fee because if it was an actual royalty they would be on even weaker grounds for the eventual lawsuits than they're already going to be because if if you think about it there's a very specific they're calling this an install fee now why are they doing that right yeah because they need it to be legally constructed as a fee that's my thinking because otherwise why would they have cared so I'm also a little bit suspicious that they were probably sitting around talking about this with their lawyers and they were like how can we do this in some way that we don't immediately lose this lawsuit with the terms of service problem and all those sorts of things and they're like well we said we could change fees at any time let's just call this a fee come up with a way that this can be a fee for a per activity thing instead of a royalty which we maybe couldn't defend in court so that's another thing simply the TOs at the same time just get rid of it yeah this is just uh 48 minutes ago which it looks like they're gonna cap the fee to a four percent I assumption on Revenue so it's not a royalty but it can go as far as four percent the other thing that was interesting about that is it also said that that developers would have to self-report their installs oh I'm sorry no one downloaded my game sorry about that yeah I got officially zero in fact they did a negative 200 000 install so I think you actually owe me a little bit of money yeah this whole thing makes no sense man like the this is why we use a normal rev share model in the industry this is why it's so standard because this kind of a direction makes absolutely no sense it is impossible to enforce it leads to weird situations like this it leads to defining how different developers can actually enter the market how they can compose their business in the market and it opens them up to abuse like the idea of just downloading a game and charging the developer that's going to get abused to hell man like there's no there's no good end to this so I I really don't understand why anyone who may had the decision-making power to do this at Unity thought that this was going to turn out okay it it has to be some kind of insane kind of pressure that they're under to do this in this way for them to do it because it makes no sense it makes absolutely no sense in the market I actually I think I mean I I still think the most reasonable answer is two answers one the people running the company have never made games or they're so abstracted away from the game Market that at this point in their lifetime they just don't have reality or touch so this idea sounds really great on paper we're gonna make some more money 95 of the cases will be cheaper than unreal or whatever their supposed you know statistics are and that's that so this is the idea this is the direction we're going and I still am contending that the ad revenue is the biggest driver because if you want to make the 100 billion dollar business you got to have ads if you want to be able to show anyone's ad like Macy's will not show you ads unless if you can say hey I'll deliver 100 million hours of this ad like you have to say like or I just said Macy's I'm making up just a large company it's very very hard to get any large company to buy in without this I mean twitch did the same thing why do you think twitch started doing pre-roll why do you think they started pushing all this stuff all this rep shares because they need to meet a minimum amount of saying hey we can scale our our uh effectively our ad platform we can do 100 billion minutes this month this is why you should choose us because no one's going to choose any of these platforms platforms if they know they can't get through it I mean Netflix has talked about some of the struggles with ads and being able to get through this as well and some of theirs that they're growing in they'll believe in the future at some point they'll be you know at a good place for ads and you know but as you can see if even Netflix is saying hey it takes a while to do it and we have literally hundreds of billions of or hundreds of millions of customers it's not a straightforward answer so to me that seems like the most obvious one which is the alternative is ads join into ads or get this really unrealistic fee and so yeah because there's there's no reason there's no reason to do it otherwise because like the thing is is they have they made it limited to four percent in this this article right if they actually come out and say that if this is if this is true and not just hearsay just do a four percent rev share and wave it if they use the ad system done like then why use this convoluted system of installs to do this I don't understand why that would be necessary if they want you to join in the ad system they could say if you join into the ad system we drop your Revenue share for every copy of your game itself like that's it yeah that's an easy move right and but with this they're like oh if you're if you're part of this you have to pay 20 cents per install and that's up to four percent like you're just getting really in the weeds with how this is being implemented and it's going to lead the confusion and people being pissed off and like there's no reason for it before this it was uncapped and that was even more ridiculous but like at least this is a little bit more sane it still doesn't make sense though it could be greed I mean like to say the least another reason why you would do the install fee thing is because it allows you to capture revenue from ghosts right people who have already sold a million copies of their game if you're going to do a revenue share thing starting January 1st well you don't get any of that because it happened previously but if it's an install fee well then every time people are installing those things on Steam again because they buy a new machine you capture that Revenue so it's also like a a way of shaking down a ghost for cash right and I guess it's true I don't know if that like like I said I can come up with tons of theories I don't know how many of them they thought of and or or like which ones they found compelling but they're all bad that's the weird yeah it's like everyone I think none of it's good no none of it's good like even even that situation where it's like shaking down a ghost right if somebody's just reinstalling the game a whole bunch of times they're going to cap it at four percent what if nobody's bought the game what if you make a hundred thousand downloads and no one's bought the game in that time they're getting four percent of nothing still so it's like the system still doesn't make any sense just do it a four percent rev share and and lay it to bed right it's it's absurd so so let's follow up with with one last thing which is can Unity earn back the trust can they actually become what they were because you know whether I mean Casey seems like you've had a longer spotty history with unity uh but you know I've always really just appreciated the fact that they've built something that I a very novice game developer but good programmer could go and make a game I think that that's super super cool and it's actually pretty easy to use and so is it possible for them to kind of win back the audience or is this kind of one of those permanent stains that are very very hard to ever get rid of it's really easy to lose trust it's really easy to lose trust it's super hard to get it back and I think the biggest thing with this is the deletion of that TOS from like where they 404 that GitHub is going to do so much more damage if it was just a bad business decision I think it'd be easy to walk back but everyone knows they deleted that now and the moment that they did that it was like oh you knew this would be hated it was intentional and you just said Fu like that's that's going to do so much damage on its own if they would have left that up originally and and then they walked it back like bad business decision we're sorry about that it's fine like I don't think it would have been as bad but with that and with the all of the game developers reaching out about it I don't know if you saw Twitter where it was on fire with us every Game Dev and their mom was out there making a big old image statement and that's spread through social media like wildfires so you've alienated the developers you've alienated the players and that's going to be really rough dude like that's a hard thing to win I would say that the the real problem for me has always been and the reason I was warning about this way beforehand is the financials I think if they don't fix those then I don't know why anyone would trust them because as long as their company is burning through that much cash the game Market is the the engine Market it's not big enough to support it you just kind of know that so I feel like if you look uh and and Prime you have the most you have the most Corp cred of of anyone here on on this uh on this discussion so I'm a sellout thank you no I I mean this in the in the like way of like you know what's up and I don't necessarily so here's the thing Percy saas is a huge market so I don't really understand why Unity didn't just try to be a per seed SAS Market for games is it just that I I maybe it's because they weren't satisfied with that as maybe that's not quite astronomic enough but when I think of like like I said you know things like uh Autodesk licensing works this way Adobe work is a huge company that works this way was it just what's the problem like why couldn't they just be a SAS company I don't understand it because if they had done that then everyone's interests are aligned you got to pay 100 200 um a month for this thing yes it's somewhat expensive but we give you this whole editor and the runtime everyone's interests are aligned we don't have to start going off and you know having this huge ad business and all these other things so I I don't get it that's the part I don't get if they somehow could return to that and just say we're going to be a straight SAS company you pay for your seats we get rid of all this extraneous stuff then maybe they could do it but until those financials look better they're are just going to have to do stuff like this and so I'm going to do weird stuff over and over yeah yeah you're totally right you're absolutely right so the financials are the problem and until they articulate a way that they're going to have a business model that makes sense financially for them that also makes sense finances for their customers I don't see how the trust could be earned they could fool people into trusting them but real trust from people who are watching these financials I don't see it happening yeah and for the people that aren't watching into the financial side of that like they've pissed off so many people and like people who play video games like a lot of people who play video games they look up to the studio that they're on they want wow the studio of the game that I love is mad at Unity right now and they'll just stop right there they'll just be pissed at Unity forever and they're starting to see games and you know they're like oh I'm sorry you made your game in unity that sucks like even like I run a game development Community right like I I teach people to make video games as part of what I do here on Twitch right because I've been doing this for like 20 years and my discord's got about it's like 5 000 people in there there's people in there going like Hey how do I switch off of unity I'm terrified of this Indie devs that are just starting out that have never used an engineer for like I don't want to use Unity because of how bad this looks and people that have been in the industry for decades are like I don't want to use Unity because of how bad this looks so they've pissed off everyone top to bottom here like every singles type of Studio you could have going all the way down to the novice right and that's I don't know how they're gonna win that pack dude like I I don't see an end game where that works where if you pay attention to the financials like you said completely correct it looks really unstable if you're not paying attention to the financials you go wow everyone's everything's on fire and this looks like it screws over my favorite game Studio I don't want to touch the studio I don't want to touch this Unity so like I don't know how they win their back dude especially with like the removal of the uh the TOs just kills me I think that's the worst one because it shows so much intent for the action and that's like you bastards you know because yeah because it's it's one thing to take the L and be like hey we screwed up hard perfect trust hard because even if they went back you still have to answer the question of you know the financials and all that and why doesn't SAS work and ultimately being a publicly traded company people wants you they want you to earn more money and so that's like a a danger it should have remained private be a private company probably would have solved most these issues because you don't need more money you just got to be fine with what you make and so like those things all put together seem hard and then you have this whole thing with app loving and ads and trying to make your own ad platform it just seems like no matter what they're gonna do how are you going to sell it in five years to all these kids right now that are coming into it all the next generation is going to have this kind of like huge oh it took like like it's kind of a like a relate to relate Microsoft had a really hard time getting over their eee days right I mean despite them still doing it but nonetheless they you know it took it a long time for developers to start trusting them again and so you could see the exact same things like do they have the ability to do a decade of winning back people's trust yeah and you've also got the elephant in the room too because you have things like Godot which is another option that people are starting to get really into a lot of unity devs are like I'm just going to switch to that because it's free it's open source and it has a lot of really good features the way that I see Godot right now is it's it's blender it's blender back in the old days back when blender was fighting against Mayan 3ds Max right when you when you saw like blender in the early days when it was kind of crunchy and it was getting a little bit better over time and now blender is awesome it's really good now and Godot is the same way you're going to see that just keep excelling and they've gotten a huge amount of support a huge amount of Interest because of this like Unity is literally just handed them a golden ticket and said take take this take my whole business away from me you know and and with something that's free and open source like that you don't have to worry about this happening again so a lot of developers are going to choose that because it's stable over anything else and some other I'm going to choose unreal because that has a stable business model that makes sense over anything else yeah so like not only do they have to win the trust back but they've got competitors that already have it like that's the big thing you know and I think uh the we have we don't know if we've seen the last of that yet because for example there are two things that could be coming down the pipe for all we know right and I don't know one of them is unreal makes a move at this point and they offer better terms than they're offering right now as a way of capitalizing on this I doubt they will because they're more of a fortnight company than an engine company I mean they don't really care about engine like you sing it that much anymore right but the other one is that there's a big Defector to God because one of the things that Godot doesn't have right now is any really high profile people they have some games that have been successful like brotato I think and there was another one that there was a Sonic game made it too yeah and Dome keeper so they're getting a little bit more street cred there but if you know if some major company um like who's a Unity a main Unity House like you know play dead or somebody like that decides to do their next really big you know heavyweight game in Godot and that announcement comes down the pipe well there's more there than just the credibility when you work with some hype like you know more AAA sort of Direction game like that you get a lot more of their developer input you get them contributing back to the engine the engine gets Polished in ways that it wasn't polished before and that also adds a lot of momentum to your engine too and so Unity has basically now opened the door for those big defections to happen I don't know if they will but if they do that adds a lot of momentum to Godot right at precisely the time when Unity can't really afford it so again we don't know what's going to happen in the next few months but we could see something like that do you think I'm already seeing other Studios doing like other engine companies doing the exact same thing so if you look at game maker Studio it's really good for making 2D games it's actually one of the things that I work in they offer now um free exports for the next three months they just immediately put that up because they're like oh unity's getting wrecked Perfect come over here and get free exports for three months like that is that you're gonna see that immediately it's smart it's really smart do you think that open source has the ability to actually capitalize on this because there is you know there's Bevy bevy's a big one people are really all the rust nerds are just just horny as can be over Bevy uh obviously Godot is doing really really good like can it actually become good enough to compete with unity because I I would assume with 7 000 employees or whatever the crazy number I've heard they can build things quite quick and so is it possible for something open source to actually actually do something well or is it just kind of more of a pipe dream I think a dough is already doing things quite well I think some of the games that were made it are actually really fantastic and with this kind of interest on it I think I expect very good things from it personally and that's because I I make games for a living that's what I do I'm planning on looking at Godot as one of the options for our future games I was already planning on doing that and after this seeing that they're getting so much interest right now that means that they're going to get a whole bunch of people that want to use it they're going to get a whole bunch of you know feature requests they're gonna have people that are interested in helping with the project building the stuff out this is only going to be positive for it and I don't see any reason not to use it and with the idea of like wow I never have to pay a seat license I never have to deal with cost per install I never have to deal with royalty structures none of this I could just have the engine and just build things in it if I want to and I can modify the engine if something doesn't work to the specification that I need to that's some powerful stuff that's really good and for very novice developers like ones who are just starting out it's still very usable in fact I I run a game Jam uh four times a year every year and we get hundreds and hundreds of submissions in this game Jam right more than half of this missions are made in Godot already and they have been for the last like two years so people are definitely using this and the younger generation of people who are just getting into this the ones who are just starting this are definitely using it as well okay I would also add that I think that when you look at who it's competing against it's the most favorable competitor for Godot if you asked me if Godot is going to be able to match Unreal Engine I would say probably not if you ask me if Godot is going to be able to match Unity I would say there's a good chance there and the reason for that is they're both sort of structured in a similar way they're both uh less less about trying to make sort of like the optimal kind of like high-end doing all of this crazy stuff kind of engine and more about like hey it's this sort of like object oriented you drop things into a world kind of Builder maybe it doesn't scale that great but we're kind of working on it sort of thing that's that's unity in a lot of ways Unity already wasn't really great at a lot of scaling things and those sorts of things so the kinds of weaknesses that I I mean I should say I work on engines I don't use them so I couldn't give a really intimate opinion but from a bird's eye view when you look at good versus Unity they seem to be doing similar things so it doesn't seem like a stretch to me just to think that Godot could improve up to that point especially because most of the things that I've heard from developers uni using Unity these days is that it has not been getting better it has actually been stagnating um in the past few years oh yeah you're not wrong about that at all actually um from from the people that I've talked to that have switched over from Unity Internet working Godot they're like wow this is really familiar yes um if you're going from that to unreal unreal is a completely different animal like completely different animal it's made for a different kind of situation so yeah you're totally right absolutely right of it well this has been awesome thank you for uh joining me both of you guys uh first off big fans of both of you so this is fantastic to have you both on uh again it's good to see you yeah oh wait oh wait I know my camera's there okay it's just I don't okay so never mind I don't even want to talk about it okay it's emotionally bruising um either way uh this has been fantastic and so I'll just make sure Casey and Thor I'll make sure we get out
