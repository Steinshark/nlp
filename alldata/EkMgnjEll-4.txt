oh hey there welcome to my office tour do you know do do you get the reference I'm referencing MTV Cribs from like back in the90s you're too young okay fine come on in come on in all right in all seriousness I have made some major changes to my office to my workspace and I'm really excited to take you along with me today and share with you some of my favorite things in my home office as you know I am a software developer I work full-time in in developer relations I also obviously I mean we're talking I am a content creator a YouTuber uh and I also just founded my own company called takeoff so I need an office space that really is great for both creativity for both uh sitting down and having focused time I need a multi approach to my office space it's not just used for one thing in fact there are parts of this office which I'm not going to show you today or maybe I will if you're really lucky or really unlucky because it's a little bit of a disaster over here but we're going to start with the tech the cool stuff and I recently just got a new monitor so that is going to be the first thing we dive into you know me I love Apple products and I was using for quite a few months if not a year now the two Apple Studio displays and I love them they've been great recently though I got shipped this other monitor you can kind of see part of it here uh which I'm going to be taking you through and all the other things all right let's just jump right into it if you haven't already you know the drill hit that subscribe button leave in the comments any other questions you have about my workspace or home office setup okay let's get into [Music] it all right you can see here I have set up the Dell 49 in curved Monitor and I've been seeing these on social media for quite a while and I thought to myself okay I really like how this looks I just don't know if I'm going to enjoy it is it going to be too close and personal when I'm working like is there enough space but honestly I can tell you I really love it so what do I love about it all right so here are my favorite things about it that I really love so far one being you know obviously that it has a slight curve to it it's really good when I'm sitting let me show you or standing here let me show you how close I am put you down here we're getting real here this is high quality production y'all but I really want to show you so first of all I can still lift the standing Mount desk which we will get into which one I have and all of that in a sec here but I can still lift it up and so it's great for you know this height when I can stand and work I really enjoy this but also too it's not so much that here let me take you and put you behind here I'm trying to get you to see that it doesn't feel as though I'm necessarily standing like I thought I'd be like directly to it there would be no space in between but there's not it's a good amount of space that I can easily see the entire monitor still now honestly I would definitely not go any bigger than 49 in this might might be even pushing it to be honest with you but here's how I set it up so far so what I typically do say if I'm in a coding environment or building or coding mindset I should say I will have my um IDE open on one side so in this case I have a little this is an old project here but you can see I have my vs code open then I would have something where it's the actual um browser so I can see what I am building for example that's worked pretty well for me with this this uh monitor I like that setup and then maybe I'll have on the other side something around music or something else going on I don't I don't see a huge difference between the curved Monitor and then my two apple monitors for that aspect like the workflow if I prefer one over the other I think it's still a little too soon I actually have my Apple monitors right here and I need to figure out what to do with them because I love them the one thing though I will say though about Apple Studio display I shouldn't call them on monitors Apple Studio display to be particular um is the screen the graphics the display in general is higher quality I have found so that is something that feels like I'm giving up for this curved monitor but for now I'm having a lot of fun with it I really like it but I'm curious to hear I feel like it's very divided if people like the studio displays better or the curved so leave in the comments what you prefer all right next up is something that I've been gatekeeping for well kind of forever and it's not because I don't want to let people know about it or anything like that but what it is is I don't know if I would get the same one again is why I never say the brand of the standing Mount desk so this for people who always are asking it is called a standing Mount desk what you can do is simply lower the desk and Rise the desk and I love this because when I first got my actual desk my physical desk which is from Restoration Hardware I was working full-time in office this is before everyone went remote and all of that and I didn't need a standing desk cuz this was more so going to be for storage it was just more for aesthetic purposes then when I started working from home I realized very quickly I need to stand as well I don't stand 24/7 that's a question people ask they like do you always stand while you work no I don't I sit too the reality is though I needed something that I could put on top of my desk and that is where the standing Mount desk came in so with this standing Mount desk it is by a brand called Vivo I like it it's quite heavy though is why I don't necessarily always recommend this one it is really heavy to lift up or down but then on the flip side it can hold very well I mean this massive monitor so yes standing Mount desk if you search up Vivo you will find it all right next up let's talk about this chair this is the Herman Miller EMB body chair other than being very good at swiveling around very quickly as you just saw it is incredible so for context here this is not the cheapest chair I knew this going into it actually it's probably one of the most expensive chairs Herman Miller makes and why did I get it Tiff why would you get one of the most expensive chairs it doesn't make any sense I hear you I hear you but guess what I've had this chair now for how long have I had this chair for quite a few years I would say three maybe going on four years I think even maybe longer and I'm probably going to have it for another I don't even know how long but it's still in great condition and it's held its shape very well it's an investment it's an investment on my posture my health when I sit down I know I am sitting with an ergonomic chair now let's be honest there are times where I am sitting in this chair not utilizing its full capability what I mean by that is sometimes I'll sit hunched over be coating you know Hood up the whole nine yards and that's the reality I think this chair is worth the investment if you are really going to utilize the features it has to offer meaning you really take care of yourself when you are sitting in it you're not slumped over you're being very proactive and I sometimes don't do that so I do think it's worth it in certain scenarios but I also think there are a ton of other chairs out there so would I recommend this one well I mean it's it's hard yes kind of I don't know would I do it again probably because I really like the look of it too it also for me feels like an art piece okay let's talk art for a second so you can see in this room this is actually a bedroom that can converted to my office and why I'm not showing you down below is well cuz I need to clean up that stuff but um aside from this which is a little bit of a mess mug sleeps there my dog um and I need to fold my clothes come on Tiff get with the chores but I love art we have art throughout our home and I wanted to incorporate these two pieces I was a dancer a ballet dancer growing up and then also to I just love this photo of this lion it's from Africa and I just think it really represents strength and beauty and I just love it then if you go into here on this side of my office I have this one I just got uh which is of course Steve Jobs and I'm obsessed with it it's uh number four number four I have to look again um but number four I think out of 10 in the world four out of five in the world I got to double check that um for the original so this was uh printed in a dark room it's the one of the original photographs from this I mean we've all seen this but this is one of The Originals which is pretty cool and I also collect lights I love collecting old vintage lights so this one made it into my office which I think is pretty cool it's from the 1960s it is from a film set all right back to more of the technical things here for my keyboard and my mouse Logitech all the way huge Logitech fan I mean I also love to okay they're probably really dirty so I apologize um but I love to how between let's see here you can switch between you know different kind kind of computer so there's one two three so I use this I can easily just press two for my work computer or three for a different computer um because as you know on top of doing all of this I do work full-time so it's nice to be able to switch easily between computers oh hey there it's me again I have a mirror here too we collected this mirror I it it's just a temporary place we're going to be moving into a bigger space in about another year and a little bit that is the first time I shared that information actually on uh social media but more to come on that in a bit here and I'm going to get you to help me design a fully new office which is coming soon um in about as I mentioned a year but in the meantime this is where this mirror is sitting so yeah that is my office space I think we went through everything I feel like we did everything pretty quickly for me having an office space that is both functional but also too I think anyways looks really nice or it makes me feel really good it makes me feel happy it's bright I need to get real plants these are fake plants I need to upgrade to uh the real thing I'm just scared the commitment I feel like I'm going to kill the real plants I'm not a good plant Monon anyways I hope this gave you some inspiration for your office or your setup I mean I I think at the end of the day it's about finding what works best for you and also too recognizing that this office for me did not come together overnight it took me a long time a long time cuz sometimes people be like why how did you have so much money to spend on this stuff it's not as though I ordered everything at once and keep that in mind when you were building out your office too the space is for you and uh do some things to really customize it for you I mean I have you can see here this hat which is uh Saskatchewan Ru Riders because that's from Saskatchewan where I grew up in Canada so just like things like that I find kind of give it a little a little something something anyways I hope you enjoyed this updated desk tour for coding content creation um running a business it's just for me it's my happy spot anyways let me know if you have any questions down below and I will see you all soon thanks [Music] everyone
