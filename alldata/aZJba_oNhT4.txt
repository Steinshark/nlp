hello everyone and welcome porsche tycon vs tesla model s now how in the world is the tesla capable of literally double the porsche's range 402 miles versus 201 that's a question i've been trying to figure out for quite some time and the speculation often goes as follows tesla is cheating and lying about their actual range figures the epa is in love with tesla and gives them favorable results and porsche is essentially sandbagging understating the true range of their cars by publishing conservative figures about their range and the beautiful thing is dave vandewarp of car and driver smacks all of this silly speculation in the face with cold hard facts it's the best article i've read all year and i'd encourage you to pick up a september 2020 issue of car and driver next time you're at the grocery store it's the one with it look on the cover there's a red ferrari and what is that it's like a it's like a fancy volkswagen no no that looks like the new that's the new corvette so it's got a ferrari corvette you'll know anyways by the magazine no this is not sponsored turn to page 52 and gorge on fax in this video we're going to focus on the two parts i find the most fascinating and dive a little deeper epa testing and road load okay so there's five categories here explaining why the tesla has so much more range than the porsche so let's start off with epa testing so where does this porsche turbo's 201 mile range actually come from so for the epa testing of course there are city tests that have to be done to get that city mpg rating and there are highway tests that have to be done to get that highway mpg rating so this is a two-cycle approach within the epa testing that all the manufacturers are going to do and so what porsche does is they put their car through these tests and they end up getting a range estimate out of these tests so let's say that range estimate ends up being 287 miles well here's the thing these epi tests are really easy to do really well on it's not real world it's not going to give you what your actual range will be in the real world and the epa knows this so you have to apply a correction factor in this case for this simple two-cycle system the correction factor is 0.7 so let's say for example porsche runs their two-cycle testing and their range ends up being 287 miles well they multiply that by 0.7 and what do you know they get a total range of 201 miles okay so how does tesla get their 402 miles of range well they undergo that exact same two cycle city and highway testing to come up with their range estimate and let's say that number ends up being 541 miles well if you multiply that 541 miles by that 0.7 correction factor you get a range of 379 miles but of course the tesla range is 402 miles it's not 379. so where does that 402 come from well what the epa allows you to do instead of taking this just standard 0.7 correction factor you can actually come up with your own correction factor by undergoing three additional tests so there's an acceleration test a test that requires you using your air conditioning system and a test where you're driving in the cold 20 degrees fahrenheit and so if you do all of these five cycles here you divide that by your two cycle results you get a correction factor and for tesla that number ends up being in the range of 0.705 to 0.756 the higher the number the better here because it means you're taking less range off of your estimate and so this is the range they end up falling in throughout their product lineup whether it's the model 3 the model y the model s etc so for this model s long range plus that correction factor ends up being 0.743 which when you multiply that by 541 gives you a total range of 402 miles now is it dumb that not all vehicles are undergoing the exact same testing and yes i think that is dumb i think there should be consistency among all the electric cars so why is it this way well basically the manufacturers are like we don't want to do all this extra work so they're like epa we don't want to do all that extra work and then the epa is like well okay you can multiply it by 0.7 and it's not quite that simple but that's the basics of the story and so you know tesla's going the extra effort in order to you know show that they have a very good range and ultimately you know they're only gaining 23 miles here so the car is 402 versus 201 the reason why they're up so high is not purely because of this epa testing they're only getting 23 of those extra 201 miles through this epa testing so the only two companies currently that are doing the extra work to try and boost their scores are tesla and audi so it's not all epa testing here that's the deal and that's why we're going to show these other four categories of what's actually making up this 201 mile deficit that the porsche turbo has so the next three factors we'll just touch on briefly starting with battery capacity of course if you have a larger battery you get to go further that's how it works you have more energy stored on board so you can drive farther and that is the case with the tesla model s so the porsche tycon has a 93.4 kilowatt hour battery however they only allow you to use 83.7 kilowatt hours of that battery pack so their effective battery pack size is 83.7 kilowatt hours that's how much energy you have to use and they save that rest as a little buffer to make sure that that battery lasts a long time now for the tesla model s they're a bit more sketchy about sharing all of this information so we don't really know the exact sizes and how much they block off but it's about a 100 kilowatt hour pack and they seem to allow you to use more of that battery so let's say they allow you to use 95 percent leaving just a 5 buffer rather than a 10 buffer like the porsche that's an extra 11.3 kilowatt hours over this porsche battery which in terms of range based on its combined fuel economy rating means this has another 39 miles just from the fact that it has a larger battery moving on to regen and motor efficiency tesla also seems to have a powertrain efficiency advantage over porsche you can read more about that in the car and driver article but they also employ a very different regen strategy and so in the porsche tycon when you let off the accelerator pedal it basically just coasts in neutral when you do that in the model s when you let off the accelerator pedal it is giving you aggressive regen so taking that energy and putting it back into the car by slowing down the car putting that energy back into the battery and so the porsche tycoon is only doing this if you start touching that brake pedal and so i believe in the way these tests are run that leads to an advantage for the tesla pulling in more of that energy and it's probably something where real world the ticon is going to be able to pull in some energy through regen and get a bit more efficiency there but overall the regen and motor efficiency advantage goes to the model s and that plays a healthy role in its 201 mile range advantage moving on to voluntary range reduction so here's where the conspiracy theories go wild but they don't need to so for the porsche turbo the ticon turbo which has when tested by the epa they found it had a range of 202 miles well porsche gave it a range of 201 miles so they reduced it by one mile and why would they do that well basically it was a rounding difference the epa rounded up porsche decided to round down now on the turbo s the epa got a rating of 200 whereas porsche gave it a rating of 192. so why would they voluntarily take eight miles off well that's what porsche got in their own testing so they went with the number that they got in their testing rather than the number the epa got and honestly i think it's probably uh more accurate of them to go with this strategy here the 201 the 192 because the turbo s versus the turbo has more power it has larger wheels which we know make a significant difference on range and it has wider tires and so i would imagine that the actual difference in range between the two is probably larger than just two miles so anyways i i think it makes sense the way they did it and they didn't just say hey we're just going to choose these really conservative numbers those were the numbers porsche got in their own testing so that's what they went with now surprise surprise porsche is not the only one that's giving a voluntary reduction on their range so tesla actually does it with three of their models the model 3 performance with 18-inch wheels has a rating from the epa of 332 voluntarily tesla took 10 miles off that range and gave it a rating of 322. same story with the model y long range and the model y performance going from 320 down to 316 and from 316 down to 315 for those respective models so tesla also does this uh it's probably there's some marketing aspects to it some different reasons why you might want to provide a different rating than what you have what you were given by the epa but regardless both of these companies are doing it on certain models now just to reiterate this 201 mile gap in range that the tesla model s has the porsche is only voluntarily uh taking away one of those 201 miles so yes part of it is explained by porsche being conservative one out of the 201 miles finally we get to my favorite parts and that is road load so this is extremely cool basically when a car is going down the road there are forces resisting that motion so there's of course aerodynamic drag which increases with speed squared we have rolling resistance from the tires on the ground and there's of course internal friction going on whether it's a transmission or bearings things like that you've got internal friction occurring within that vehicle that is preventing it from moving forward and you of course use those electric motors to power through all of that now companies have to provide an equation to the epa that gives them what these resistive forces are and the form of that equation is given as the force is equal to a some constant plus b a constant multiplied by the vehicle's velocity plus c a constant multiplied by the vehicle's velocity squared and so they have to provide this a b and c to the epa so the epa can draw out a plot of speed versus force and so basically you can look at this equation and say okay if i'm traveling at 55 miles per hour what force is resisting the car and using the equations that the manufacturers provide to you which if you cheat on there's a big fine it's not something you want to cheat on or lie about and it does get checked so ultimately you have to provide that equation now you can look at these equations for the porsche turbo and the tesla model s long range plus and so for the porsche it's 49.9 that's our a plus 0.43 that's our b plus 0.0137 that's our c and then for tesla those numbers are 30.6 0.65 and 0.0094 you can see that last number significantly less here so as velocity increases that tesla's advantage there is increasing so for example we can look at a plot of these side by side and you can see that the tesla model as long range plus has a significant advantage at any given speed the force acting on it is significantly lower so let's just look at a highway speed of say 75 miles per hour for the porsche that results in a 159 pound force and for the tesla that results in a 132 pound force so as you can see both cars are traveling at the same speed the porsche is going to require a lot more energy because it has a higher force resisting that motion and so if we were to drive for example 200 miles we can do the math and see how much energy assuming we're just on this flat straight path forever we can see how much energy it would take uh based on this force here and we'd get 63.3 kilowatt hours for the porsche and 52.5 kilowatt hours for the tesla so as you can see it takes significantly more energy for the porsche to travel down that road another way of thinking about this if you have the porsche driving down the road at 75 miles per hour the tesla would have the same force resisting its motion when the tesla is driving at 87 miles per hour so 12 miles per hour faster without an energy penalty okay so assuming our porsche is perfectly efficient we can travel 200 miles on 63.3 kilowatt hours that's just overcoming those resistive forces so our battery pack is larger than this so our actual range using the porsche's uh usable battery pack would be 265 miles now again that's assuming perfect efficiency it won't actually hit this but it's an interesting number to compare with the tesla because the tesla can travel 200 miles on 52.5 kilowatt hours let's say it's able to use 95 of a 100 kilowatt hour battery pack then it can travel 362 miles with perfect efficiency so what's interesting here is that this number is larger than the porsche's range and this number is smaller than the tesla's range so real world the porsche is probably going to do slightly better or it has a massive efficiency disadvantage versus the tesla here but either way even with perfect efficiency this proves to you that the tesla is not going to go 400 miles on the highway and so that's kind of an interesting thing there of how we're presenting range when that range doesn't necessarily correlate with how far it will go on the highway now if we look at a model s performance versus the ticon turbo not the tycon turbo s their plots for resistive load as they're traveling down the road this coast down test actually line up near perfectly so pretty interesting to see that the model s performance and the porsche tycon turbo actually have a very similar road load force resistive forces acting on them as they travel down the road i think the real important thing here is that we're given a range for a vehicle and that range doesn't really correlate with how far it can travel on the highway and so it would be beneficial to have a hey here's your highway range traveling at 75 miles per hour constant and assuming you know there's there's no wind there's no rain there's no strange conditions but here's how far you can go at 75 miles per hour and unfortunately that test doesn't exist and so we're left interpreting uh you know the data that is out there and it's difficult to know how far is an electric car actually going to go on the highway which is what matters no one cares if you have 400 miles to drive around the city that's going to take all day to use up but on the highway that's actually usable and so for people who are buying evs they're concerned about what their highway range is we don't really have a representative test to tell us what that is that's the unfortunate thing car and driver did an interesting comparison traveling at 75 miles per hour constantly in both the porsche tycon turbo s versus the model s performance with 21 inch wheels one's rated at 192 miles the tesla's rated at 326 miles and current drivers results for the range for the vehicles 209 for the ticon and 222 for the model s so very close in highway range even though the tesla is definitely more efficient and it has a higher range and it's probably going to do you know further city miles but as far as the highway range it's it's very similar and so that's wild to see uh because it has more battery pack and it has other advantages and yet it's only beating this you know by 13 miles so overall quick recap what's playing the biggest impact on the tesla having 201 additional miles over the porsche turbo well the biggest three factors are battery capacity regen and motor efficiency and this road load now the other two do play a role epa testing and voluntary reduction these are the two that are going to be talked about the most uh but they play a smaller impact versus the other ones so fascinating stuff really excited about that current driver article you should definitely pick it up and give it a read
