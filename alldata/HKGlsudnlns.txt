ladies and gentlemen many of you have recently gotten into the game of chess some of you have been into chess for a while but regardless of when you got into chess there is one Mainstay there is one constant in the world of Chess and that is the dominance of Magnus Carls and he's been the number one ranked player in the world for over a decade he was our world champion in classical chess he's also the world champion in Rapid and Blitz chess and we are all witnessing the post-world champion Magnus era and yesterday he began a tournament in Poland called the super bet rapid and Blitz Superbad is a sponsor it's a rapid and Blitz championship and I couldn't help but feel like something was a little bit amiss and maybe this is just me but I will be showing you two games from magnus's first day at the tournament I honestly don't remember the first time in a rapid and Blitz Championship that Magnus didn't win a game on day one there was three games he didn't win any of them maybe I maybe this is just some sort of recency bias on my part but even afterward Magnus gave an interview and he says something along the lines of yeah you know I actually haven't studied any chess for quite a long time I've been playing poker I've been I have a Magnus Carlson Puma shoe here um it's just interesting to see you know it is the era slowly ending is the question of I'm not trying to be like a sensationalist uh sports reporter that you know team loses one game and it's over unless you're the Boston Celtics then it's it's really over Boston Celtics anyway Magnus in this position uh is playing against in this game is playing rather slavoit this is game number one and it's in Poland so Magnus plays the Polish defense not a single Grand Master over 2700 has probably played the Polish defense while sober in the last and who knows maybe even in this game like that that streak is not broken now of course you're playing the Polish defense while in Poland all right Magnus took the walk to Poland uh and uh and now white just plays E4 and threatens the pawn on B5 now the idea here for black is Bishop B5 Bishop E4 to win a Saturn Pawn to put a little bit of pressure this is still a very decent line uh for black who will play C6 and be okay vitashik just doesn't let him do that so I mean this is a very provocative opening sure you can like not play the main lines but with 25 minutes on the clock this is provocative stuff Knight F6 Knight D2 all right not Knight C3 because Knight C3 would walk directly into B4 and justify Black's entire setup then black would simply win a pawn so Knight T2 another common idea all right trying to smash this way watch play C3 white cannot play the move D5 because black will go C4 and suddenly this is this is amazing right so vitashik plays C3 Magnus takes and plays E6 now still magnus's Pawn on B5 is hanging however is completely disinterested he is not trying to take the pawn on B5 he castles he's just playing principal chess he's not worried about the move Knight to B4 because he will just go back to B1 a square that he freed up when he moved his Knight there then he will kick this Knight out and then he will kick that Knight out and then he'll just March down the board so from an opening stage vitashek is very happy all right and uh Magnus is playing in an Uber provocative fashion uh the computer is already recommending D5 here which after Pawn takes Pawn uh White can it's not about taking back it's about playing E5 and shoving the Knight out of the way uh and then uh maybe Knight B3 this Pawn is a permanent weakness you know G4 is an idea uh rookie one is played however and obviously you don't want to necessarily Rush with this bishop B7 and now vitashik plays D5 and vitashik just has a better position I mean you you can play the Polish but at this level like you you will be punished for it and you know it's kind of an interesting question it's like uh okay he played the Polish in Poland I feel like we only let Magnus get away with this stuff and it's probably for good reasons probably because he's like the goat like imagine if a 2700 Grand Master who's only top 10 Anish giri played the Polish we'd be sitting here like what the hell is wrong with this guy like right like he's like why did he play the Polish opening when Magnus plays the Polish opening we go oh that's so that's so clever you know that's so interesting they're playing in Poland so he's so good that this dude can literally handicap himself to an opening that no top player is ever gonna play because white just gets dominant control of the setter and gets to play the move D5 but it's Magnus like it's it's actually fascinating to us as Spectators of the game to watch Magnus play at a handicapped State he takes D5 E5 Knight H5 in that exact sequence occurs now all right so why does threatening G4 to win the Knight purely Knight can't go there these pawns are doubled isolated blocking the bishop blocking the queen G6 and now Bishop H6 look at this position I mean this is pure punishment this is like look you wanna you wanna come to my country you want to play this boat you know this bozo opening against me well as the Polish number two I'm gonna have to I'm gonna have to make you pay now Magnus plays Rook G8 now he can't castle that way can't castle that way now white plays Bishop back the bishop did its job you see The Rook can return to its home square but it can never Castle because of the rules of Chess Magnus plays Knight G7 looking to consolidate now because he is Magnus he is able even Against All Odds to find a way to Spook opponents into losing their advantage all right it's just a matter of time until until vaitashek does something that that that doesn't work okay so here he thinks for a while he takes on B7 he grabs this seemingly completely dead Bishop because a knight for Bishop is still a good trade I mean it really is getting the bishop pair Queen takes B7 and now the bishop has an opportunity to drop back for the queen to attack the pawn on D5 vitashek does not play the best move apparently Bishop B1 is better he goes this way Magnus jumps in with the bishop to B4 and now it's looking a little bit clumsy like The Rook is standing in front of the pieces but all right fine The Rook is gonna go there Magnus plays the move Knight E7 that opens up both the queen and the Knight to defend the pawn on D5 and now vaitashek uh plays Rook C2 dominant control of the C file good control of the center pressure on the center as well with the queen and the Knight A3 the bishop is gonna get shoved backwards Magnus plays Knight F5 now Bishop G5 I mean he's just playing the best moves he's getting the bishop out of the way he's cutting the king he will put the bishop on F6 it will live there forever Magnus comes back and now here comes the bishop F6 the idea of Bishop F6 is to restrict the black pieces and also to open up a door for the night very very nice all right very nice play here from vaitashek now admittedly vitashek was helped by the fact that his opponent played D4 B5 like at the end of the day you did great but the dude played D4 B5 you know what I mean anyway let's fast forward 22 moves the ship is on F6 Knight fg7 I mean the position just looks miserable I mean it just looks like Magnus is sitting around waiting for the opponent to knock on the door and collect the rent if you don't collect the right he's gonna beat you to a pub like a mafia movie all right Queen D3 now Magnus takes one of six it's not H5 and he's looking to collect back his Pawn the pawn that's been left on F6 with Tasha clutch Queen C3 defending the opponent F6 threatening potential background problems also the queen can go to E5 we're at both pins pressures pressures cut space away from the diagonal and it's just a matter of time Rook d8 I mean it's a pretty miserable looking position but Magnus plays excuse me if I Tasha here plays A3 which is definitely taking the foot off the gas alright it was just a matter of time vitashek here needed to play Queen E5 I think why he didn't play this move is because after D6 he has to leave he just has to get out however this Pawn push is a massive drawback to black as you can see from the evaluation because the black queen cannot fight for this diagonal by going here you have sabotaged your Queen's activity now your King has to stick around and wait to be bludgeoned on the diagonals on the straightaway and on the C file however vaitashek I guess doesn't fully appreciate that detail and instead plays the move A3 and Magnus immediately plays Queen B8 like no hesitation all right now white cannot play Queen E5 I mean he can but after this exchange I will simply take on F6 and your very good position is no longer advantageous so okay Magnus is still there nothing has really happened to Magnus but G3 and now in this position Magnus needs to play Queen D6 he kind of needs to fully stabilize before playing G5 G4 however he plays G5 right away my dude my dude is like is like is like a hurt fighter who is still throwing bombs and he's not covering up I mean G5 man just won't stop all right he's trying to play G4 should I play Knight F4 sacrifice potentially open up the file by Tasha clean move here rookie one really nice move immobilizing the Knight also rookie five ideas and remember when you push that Knight got destabilized so now Magnus plays G4 immediately responding with the Knight and Magnus plays Rook G5 trying to hold it all together but uh Bishop D3 at a very least that's a free Pawn I can just take the pawn rookie five by uh by Magnus trying to trade the Rooks obviously the more pieces the black trades look at the eval eval plummets right so in this position by tashek has to play rookie too all right he needs to defend his Rook he needs to make sure that after rookie 2 he is the only one with the Rook surviving but he plays Knight F5 and for the second time this game Magnus has an opportunity Pawn to D4 could mix things up a little bit idea being that after Knight takes D4 this and the queen cannot defend right D4 here and notice vitajik has 50 seconds they both got a minute what happened to their time rookie won Knight F6 Magnus has taken back the pawn but uh oh let's let's keep something in mind this is this has been a bad position the whole game Queen E7 is literally Checkmate Pawn to D6 blocks we mentioned this earlier I mentioned this earlier the pawn on D6 blocks blacks pieces the black queen is now miserable and after Queen C3 there is nothing that prevents you from losing because you either lose the Knight or I infiltrate in the corner so Magnus plays Knight D7 Here Comes Queen h8 you're covering up I come back to threaten made on G7 you can play Knight G6 you can also play something like Queen B7 that looks good but it's just a matter of time I mean I'm not going anywhere all right Knight to G6 rookie 2 pinning the Knight and also threatening Knight G7 all this nasty stuff Magnus plays Queen C7 Knight G7 check the Magnus Carlson resigned the game here because you cannot take if you go here I take with check you still can't take and then I win your queen probably also have mate in a few moves and if you play King D7 uh Knight E6 is good Queen F7 is good even Rook E6 is good even Bishop G6 is good but essentially after this this there's a check here Rook C2 and he's gonna lose his Queen now look on the one hand this is just Magnus played the Polish while in Poland haha you know he'll get him next you know he's he's gonna win the next one I mean this is not we shouldn't overreact right on the one hand yes on the one hand uh yes indeed and it's just a matter of time to be seen uh when Magnus goes on a winning streak again but oh I got a ding um but it it wasn't even close I mean it right so yeah and Magnus played another game later that day this one I'm not gonna analyze like in massive detail um but this was the last game of the day and it was it you know it was better and it's interesting to see how Magnus played Magnus plays by the way a carp of uh Karo Khan where you take on e4 you play Knight D7 you try to play Knight F6 take take uh in this game youngstov Duda played the best line which is Pawn to C3 and then after Bishop to G4 he did not play Bishop B2 and castle and slow play no he just called The Bluff on the bishop and played Pawn to H3 and the idea here is that black actually has to take if black tries to maintain this pin there's a very nice idea here G4 Bishop G6 Knight E5 to try to get the bishop a very powerful idea if black tries to escape we have this this bishop F4 and uh White is in very good shape so he takes and we get an end game already I mean we get a 10 move end game white has two Bishops and has a little bit more space on the queen side A4 A5 and both sides Castle and essentially in this game Magnus is going to have happened to him what he has made an entire career doing to people the Kings come up Rook D7 Bishop G5 and dudo takes on F6 damaging the structure a bit rushed for my taste and you'll notice that Magnus has spent absolutely zero time that's because he knows like Magnus is so is so Alpha that he knows that his opponents don't really want to play in the same territory as his strength even if he's the one defending Magnus Carlsen is the good of end games so even in end games where he is slightly worse he feels confident that's kind of a Sublime feeling I would imagine and the computer it never in a million years would recommend Bishop G5 and taking on F6 because you have two Bishops it's your whole advantage plus when you do this and this you have opposite color Bishops the drawing right skyrockets the computer here would have played B4 and then it would have played A4 and then it would have played King B3 and B5 it would have tried to make progress by instigating and trying to maximize the effectiveness of this bishop but A3 and this right ain't nothing there just nothing there now if you get this down to a bishop end game it's probably a draw of course I have some targets and dude is going to try right Magnus defense stabilizes notice how Magnus has not lost any time so maybe this is a little bit of a of a of a get you know of a day-ending game although yeah uh after Bishop F6 and F4 suddenly dude is making some good progress Rook H1 Ponto G5 is on the way and he's going to break in so Magnus decides look Duda has a very very pleasant position here he's freezing that and that he's got eyes on both my Pawns and at some point he's gonna make progress he's just slowly and effortlessly improving his position Pawn to F5 Rook F6 King E4 right like it's like black has no moves we're not used to seeing this all right Magnus fighting back sacrificing upon with a check to play King B6 Magnus understands that at the end of the day he holds on to that pawn pawn and Bishop pawn and Bishop and it will be a three on four now a three on four is winning if it's only three on four if it's just Kings and pawns all right if it's Rooks it's a draw probably if it's opposite colored Bishops draw 100 now maybe not at your level but I promise and so we have this we get all the way down here Magnus does have 24 minutes to six and he plays this game sticks around and the reason why this is a draw with Rooks is because there's something called fill it or defense kingpon Rook cannot make progress against King and Rook because the Rook will give a million checks and dislodge the king all right so that's what happens I'm gonna hit the forward arrow for a little bit now now Magnus did not lose this game uh you could also argue that this was actually a very good game it wasn't a bad game at all but it was a game where for 80 moves by the way notice that even with the sacrifice of the pawn it's a draw it's this position is unwinnable because it's filter defense all right and Rook B6 is a very very very fancy little technique at the end whatever you take with it's a stalemate you can go here Magnus does this and this is just philodor all right fill it or defense you got to know your end games cannot cross the sixth rank or it's a draw Rook F6 there it is Rook C6 stalemate for 88 moves Magnus was bothered and annoyed in this game now Magnus did play a very enterprising and interesting game in the second game of the day um but he wasn't able to win it was like a game where you were watching like oh it's Magnus there it is he's doing it he's doing his thing but he wasn't able to win so look I'm not I'm not the guy who's gonna be like what's happening you know like is the is the career over I mean for the Boston Celtics it absolutely is I mean y'all are done and who knows maybe Magnus is going to go on to win this tournament but the whole thing was a little bit you know Magnus is is in this really weird position as the world champion where fans analyze everything he does if Magnus shows up to the board and has a different haircut it becomes trending literally magnus's hair right now is like longer and when like not as you know capped up you know he didn't get the shape up I'm seeing posts on Reddit and Twitter about how Magnus is starting to look like Hans Neiman all right I mean for God's sake it's like unbelievable like the man just can't he just can't be himself it's like Magnus wants to play poker oh you know everybody loses their minds um but it was kind of crazy to hear him say like I haven't studied chess in months and uh is he sun setting is this like the very beginning of the sunset I don't know it's not it's sunrise here in New York but uh I hope he keeps winning let's go Magnus I'm cheering for the bounce back all right I'm hoping he wins five games in this tournament makes me look like a buffoon anyway uh I'll see you uh in the next video get out of here
