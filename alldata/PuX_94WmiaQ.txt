multi-level marketing once seen as the new way to make a part-time or full-time income from home now it's almost universally ridiculed and mocked by anyone because guys we've done the experiment the numbers are in it's a failing business model that doesn't work except if you're at the tippity-tippy top if you can get enough suckers underneath you to lose money you can then make money that is true that is an honest thing they say take a load off grab some popcorn and enjoy the marketing versus the reality get ready for some um contradictions some hypocrisy some lies ladies and gentlemen welcome to the 10 million dollar studio i'm your host coffee zilla and today you know what we're taking a look at uh some of the great mlms right let's first watch some of the marketing right bring down the computer monitor of course our first the first thing we're gonna be looking at is amway you guys know them they're sort of um the original schemers the original get rich quick scheme and uh let's take a look at what they say about themselves how can i get started do you really want to know let me show you dude han zimmer get in on this there they are the schemers [Music] so they're showing themselves with famous people okay we get it relax you sell like potions and lotions to women at home you're not exactly flying things to the moon with spacex you don't need to do this it's just a bunch of irrelevant numbers what do we need to know is like can you make a living with emily we give people opportunities to have a business of their own they will do things imagined possible before [Music] okay that's way too much out of amway's mouth is so that right before that that's doug devos the now president of amway and he's saying look we're empowering people with businesses so number one red flag no you're not you are a employee well you're in a consultant you're a independent contractor for amway but you're not a business owner let's be completely clear about that but i think you get the idea from the dc comics trailer here you're gonna make a lot of money with amway it's an exciting place to work with a lot of money 40 billion dollars in bonuses and incentives they say so how much do you really make from amway well it turns out if you're in the bottom fifty percent you make about four hundred dollars if you're in the top ten percent the median income is three thousand dollars average eleven thousand that's worse than working at mcdonald's which means only one thing mcdonald's is the greatest income opportunity of our era no seriously if you work a minimum wage job at mcdonald's you're making more than 90 of amway employees or independent business owners whatever they call that's such a lie by the way top 1 okay ladies and gentlemen 43 000 median income guys you're the valedictorian and you're making like a regular wage from like a regular job this does not justify wow maybe the way we start recruiting for walmart mcdonald's is by start playing like the employee thing but instead briana gets a demonstration from the master burger builder now next up on the chopping block oh buddy we've been needing to do this one for a while patrick bett david ladies and gentlemen owner and founder of people helping people and mlm focused on life insurance you may know him though from his youtube channel valuetainment now i have no problem with valuetainment i like it i'll watch patrick all day on valuetainment to be quite honest with you but the mlm pack what are you doing with the mlm because it bills itself as like solving all the problems guys it says you know student debt crisis what's gonna save you let's watch their advertising will the rising trade tensions between the us and the china just keep pushing these markets lower underemployment among recent college grads saving for a retirement put some fear it's not easy to ignore the financial problems we have today in retirement not a chance everyone talks about it you get very few bring financial solutions to solving oh boy here we go big big promises until now the champ is here the tap is here the champ is here one company dares to dream bigger and do the impossible when company pushes the limits of the status quo wow we got it all guys we got people smoking cigars fat cats dude this is a lot like the amway thing it's like a younger amway it's nice it's uh it's uh fresh it's exciting so what is the reality of php according to the disclosure they have to file let's check it out because they say they have the top compensation plan with the top compensation package in the marketplace for entrepreneurial agency builders php is ushering a new era of multicultural and diverse agents wow so you heard them world class this is the best we're going to get today in terms of compensation plans so it better be good so uh a little we got to go through a little bit of this the first thing you have to notice this is a measure of the average of the life licensed agents in the periods of january through december 31st uh 2019. so i wanted to make sure to get 2019's income disclosure because i know covid shook things up i didn't want to uh yeah get that in the mix so this is that and it's for agents that got their license because i know you have to get like licensed with these kinds of businesses so i wanted to make sure we measured the licensed agents and they said this is licensed agents well let's check out the numbers 800 000 of income that's pretty good well how many people get that 0.13 okay so it drops pretty steeply off from that okay 300 000 not bad 0.14 now going on from that like you basically have one percent of people making a really good income it seems like because 0.75 make 148 000 that's a great living you're gonna do very well with that well now we drop into the middle class right one percent of the people do that it's still great still good compensation here's where it really falls off down here i don't know if you can see that 64 percent of paid agents these are agents getting paid made 200 the vast majority of people who made money with php barely paid off their uh enrollment fee of 200 that year you didn't even hardly broke even on an enrollment fee over half now uh 20 of them made 2 000 in a single year terrible income let's just be honest that's not in that's like a side hustle at best seven thousand same thing six percent of people made that meaning that about 90 of php's employees also make less than uh take a guess everyone got their guests ready mcdonald's employees yes ladies and gentlemen the number one compensation plan in mlm the thing that's changing everything that's changing a world full of debt mcdonald's starting salary makes more than 90 of those people this isn't to dump on those people by the way this is the this mlm as a rule it just doesn't work guys i always tell you mlms are scams built to enrich the very people at the very top and basically no one else and to make money you have to recruit people underneath you now the thing is these people will tell you well of course of course stephen you know people that uh not many people succeed it's just like owning a business a business where most people don't succeed except there's a problem with that you don't have to go out and base your success on getting new suckers in the program this is the problem with him a limb emma lim's involved the majority of their work is hey you gotta go recruit so in order for you to succeed this is what makes mlms completely unique you have to make other people go lose you get that because to succeed you have to recruit and to recruit you have to knowingly bring people into a system where 90 of the people make less than a mcdonald's salary where it's probably slightly more than that right yeah actually it is because actually it's 95 percent of people because these 4.8 percent make only 15 000 a year i think a minimum wage at mcdonald's makes a little bit over that how do they get away with this stuff man it's mind blowing to me now we're gonna look at another uh mlm called vemma and again these are their numbers not mine damn this bra makes my breasts feel amazing michelle you should get this bra but in the bra world if if she bought a bra is this guy drunk this is like vemma sales guy what's going on here i ain't getting jack shinola that's right no jack shinola guys but you know what with v-ma vemma you're getting jack shinola if i tell her to buy that bra i'm getting broken off some that's what it's about peer to peer nobody watches commercials say that to like the billion dollar advertising industry you buffoon no one ever sits and looks at billboards and goes yo man i could see that movie no you hear it from what your friend this is the greatest lie ever forget about hey forget about the ad age where everyone's like sitting glued to their phone what are you gonna advertise on someone's phone no dude you're gonna go up to their door and knock on it and go recruit them or better yet you're gonna tell your friends hey use promo code vemma at checkout like what do you think's gonna happen your homeboy your hombre tell them how they can make money the whole thing is every time i drink this i'm making money you just get two of your friends to be customers they tell two of their friends i love how this is like the broke version of multi-level marketing like this is like the poor guy's version of a pyramid scheme it's like they're not even not even try they're not even trying to make this look legitimate it's like hey man it's just like you drink the stuff man and then you make money now of course when you go to their uh disclosure statements you will find that forty percent of the people make nine hundred dollars anyway you go down the list and you find that once again the vast majority make less than a walmart employee yes i'm changing it up for mcdonald's now what i love about this these guys are always talking about how they're different how nine to fives suck and it's such poetic justice that they actually end up making the vast majority of them way way less than if they had just gone and been a walmart greeter now for our last commercial today guys i hope you've enjoyed it by the way so far let me know if you have in the comments below we're checking out eye markets live stock guys austin gatsey you've seen these guys what are you doing right now watching you cringing clearing the path of wealth and a lifestyle most dream of probably not do you have enough honestly in doubt to retirement no enjoy life and take care of your health do you have enough to take care of your family nah looking for the bag honestly if i can get a job with you guys pay me well i'll shell why not enjoy your life now and make massive money enough to enjoy later also yes guys this is a bit on the nose don't you think don't you think this is a little too much no marketing team didn't think this was not subtle enough yes you can be as successful as a wall street trader without spending years to acquire the knowledge yes ladies and gentlemen the old don't spend time to make money get rich quick is that basically what you're saying because you're saying don't spend any time learning think so let's check out their income disclaimer guys uh yeah you go ahead and you find out 67 of eye markets live people are barely cracking a hundred dollars which i think is less less than the fee sixteen percent are cracking under a grand nine percent are cracking under two grand have you noticed a similarity between all of these income disclosures first of all they're all promising you wild success everyone says they have the greatest compensation plan in the world the reality is a bunch of losers a couple winners and the only reason and this is important they're gonna say well the couple of winners they just had heart they're real true workers and everyone needs to be like no the reason they're winning is because they got enough people underneath them to step on top of none of this works without the down line that's the important key in order to do an mlm properly you cannot have everyone succeeding that's literally you can't do it it wouldn't work the way this works is 90 or more usually 95 98 have to fail miserably in order for the one percent the 2 percent to make it and do be wildly successful and then they tell you hey greatest income opportunity of our era no i reject that anyways guys that's basically it pump the stock you could make as much as a wall street trader with none of the education um thanks for watching i'll see you guys next time i know what you need this ain't what it seems nothing but a trick trying to sell me on a dream but that was where you lost me wake up and smell the coffee
