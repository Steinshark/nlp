NX Vim let's do this getting into Neo's configuration ecosystem is notoriously difficult you know we we launch something about Nyx in neovim it's just like such a such a thick what appears to be Russian accent it's beautiful getting into Neo's configuration ecosystem is notoriously difficult with so many plugins package managers guides and even complete distributions out there it can literally take weeks for someone without the configur ation to arrive at a usable solution I do I do want to say that I am extremely NX curious if I could have time NYX is like really high on my things that I I want to I want to learn I think NYX is truly what development should have been and what I mean by that is that you can have the configuration effectively for your OS on a per directory level as far as I understand and so you can just hydrate and start things so fast and to me that does really seem like it cuz we have so much crap built into trying to make each project Standalone like Docker is something and people develop through Docker and it's like not a good experience developing through I've never heard people being like developing through Dockers the best experience there is no there's like a whole bunch of crap you have to get set up every single one of them is just like bespoke setup it's just not fun at all so I would love the idea of Nicks to be able to go anywhere and instantly set up I'm not saying Docker isn't bad Docker is amazing a Docker is truly amazing but it's not a great experience to veloping on it's never been that great but fear not because if you happen to know a little bit about NX you can make use of the amazing distribution called NX V unlike anything that we usually call a new distri is Nix Vim uh was that Ulta Force cuz I know he was working on a bunch of stuff when it came to uh neovim and Nyx so I'm curious if this is Alta Four's kind of creation here NX comes Bare Bones looking exactly the same as a regular unconfigured Neo the only difference is it's super simple to configure on only taking a couple of lines to enable most popular plugins install and configure LSP servers and set options or color schemes without having to do any GitHub plug-in hunting and the fastest way to begin using nwim is to run this command in an empty directory it will initialize an example nwim configuration with pl. n responsible for fetching all dependencies and files in config being the configuration itself try it out immediately simply by running NYX run in the flag directory it doesn't include much at the moment so let's add some options open the official documentation page which you can find in the link in the description and there you will see a list of all options and plugins provided by default this is really interesting I actually really I would love to see more of this because there is this whole problem with a lot of PE I mean the problem is is that fundamentally the people who are willing to configure neovim are the same people who are willing to go and understand nxs and so the capture group of who you're actually capturing is just a subset of the people already getting proficient at Lua and neovim and setting everything up and so it's like you're not actually expanding the amount of people who are interested in this subset of Technology you're actually just just simply narrowing it a decent amount again super interested though but at the end of the day I'm going to want my own configuration the way I want it at all points and I'm sure there's a good way to configure this but like every key map everything I just wanted a specific way I don't know if I want Airline and buffer line and clang DX sessions and Chad tree and all like I don't know if I want any of those in there maybe I just want what I want and I maybe I don't want to have to configure a second layer of configuration and so I I get the anti- argument for NYX as well let's start with the most important one and S A color scheme Nix wi is very smart so Groove box is a good color scheme I loved Groove box for a very long long time and then Ken wheeler upon seeing Groove box told me that I'm driving an old Buick and ever since then it's like hurt my emotions okay when someone accuses you of driving an old Buick my grandma used to drive with us kids in a Buick and smoke with the windows up okay I can't be having people bringing back young childhood memories all right it's too painful it's entirely too painful other plugins will automatically ad up to it with no extra steps required I enabled luine and buffer line. EnV was included in template configuration by default if we try to run this run again we will see that both of them adopt to group box automatically no let's say that we want to get some real work done ASAP and get the configuration out of the way in just a couple of seconds in that case we can quickly enable and install our required language server with just one line enable completion for LSP and some other sources while we're at it and also set some key bindings by copy pasting this chunk of code from the documentation see this is one of those problems I have again you know what I mean whenever you add a layer of abstraction this is more just like a just a I'm not trying to say this isn't great like you're doing a good job on this product but the thing that I always dislike is whenever you have a way to configure something and you add a layer of abstraction on top of the way to configure something and then it requires you to effectively recreate that same abstraction so for you to understand how compy because this is just compy right here that's all we're looking at right here uh if for you to understand compy you have to understand what compy does and then on top of it you have to understand how this system interacts with the underlying system and so I always feel like this is one of those really difficult kind of weird grounds that just are really frustrating because I don't know if you're really buying anything I would much rather see this exact same piece of code in this exact same stuff but trying to figure out a way to just do it in Lua so that way in Lua I can just enable all these things you know what I mean uh I use Lua to configure and have NYX just copy the file over that's interesting that's super interesting so you kind of invert the process you actually have Lua come in and generate all the Nick stuff out and then have that do all the generation I mean to me that's that's even better if I'm hearing you correctly because then you get all the autocomplete and everything you need from from Lua just without all the the difficulty you get reproducibility I do I do understand you get reproducibility but you still program stringified Lua which I think is just really hard I think polar mutex that's very interesting how he does it which is that are you still using anible I'm I'm going to rehydrate all my anible stuff cuz I really like ansible cuz anible is kind of like this nice middle ground and another reason why I really like ansible is that anible allows you to write cross system generation so I'm gonna generate mine and then on top of it I'm going to also make sure that if I ever have to use a Macintosh that I can also have my exact same thing running on Macintosh as I do on Linux so it does make things nice anible is a very amazing tool I really enjoyed anible triy out with a file written in your favorite language with this command and just like that we have an easy to maintain working setup Co do you see how statistically long that a equals 5 is now me personally I would have chosen the bitwise knot of C is equal to three like that that would have been my math equation but I appreciate his math equation with fancy completion and error cheing we can improve it even further by including some more popular plugins like telescope the fact that you didn't have Harpoon okay I'm over here saying how great this is and then you just you just you just do this to me I get it telescope is one step more useful than Harpoon okay cuz it's the fuzzy finder okay it's the truest introduction into things okay but come on you just you're telling me you're telling me you don't like oil. EnV and three seater with each one of them having their own special options not just plugins ni Sim also allows you to easily set options and globals with corresponding attribute sets again this I hear what you're doing but again how do you know how to set these things well first you have to know how it's done in vim and their names then you have to know how to do it within this thing so you have to do the again the translations the double translations especially like something like map leader globals do whatever it's a another map leader for those that someone's saying what is that help shift with if you don't know shift with it's right here there you go you can read about it any of these options you can just read about in Vim you know what I mean they're already available I think the docs just explain everything I understand the docs explain everything but remember the docs have to explain everything that already exists somewhere else so you have to do the D you you still have to do the translation I want to set my X option to a value all right where is X option where is map leader is map leader in options or is it in global you know you have to do the thing where's your buffer local leader where's your buffer options versus your window options what about your local globals or your Global locals or whatever those that that that thing right there's like all those you know what I'm saying there's like there's a lot of things assign keups by adding them to keups list declaratively Define Auto commands and even set highlight groups making tweaking your ni configuration what about functions right because remember Auto commands can also take in functions again that's why I'm just saying it's it's hard doing everything through NYX I do love polar mut's idea of moving more towards L to generate the Nyx to generate your environment I do think that that's fun but I do like this if you want a very simple setup this does seem like an amazing way to do it I think this would be a very amazing way to do it just as easy as home manager or nio wants all of that is great but what if you find some of your favorite plugins to be missing from nxm options fortunately for you nixim allows you to add plugins simply by adding them to the extra plug-in s where you can even configure them straight away by using this plugin and config structure we explored packaging neovin plugins for n in more detail in the previous Nix and neovin video which you can find in the link in description basic configuration aside one of the biggest advantages of using niwi for me is that your configuration can be easily uploaded to GitHub and run on any other computer with NYX without polluting that's cool I mean obviously finding another computer with NYX will be the hard part but once you find a computer with NYX so easy local environment local neovim configuration will be ignored this way meaning that theoretically multiple developers could connect to the same server with SS and have their own development environments available to them simultaneously talking about local Nim configurations nixim also provides modules for nxs home manager and NX Darin allowing you to install and configure NX system wise as a part of one of these three configs in the end NWI is a niche distribution of a niche text editor so just like NX itself I love that he just said that I mean that that that is aware right there the man's aware he just knows like hey this is a niche of a niche enjoy it I I'm happy he did this I think this is probably a funner project to build than anything else because you get to learn a ton about everything to me this seems like a great project to go out there and try it's a weird novelty for some and gold for others I absolutely love it and the way it handles SS piece is genuinely so much better than the Alternatives and so now I would like to thank gate on the page maintainer of nickv for helping me out out with some parts of this video and of course the sponsors of this video specifically Hoskins be easy H let's go peasy let's go not n what let's go AC put in is that zavier is that Javier is that chavier or is that Xavier I don't know I can never I can never tell can we go back to um not a nut can anyone tell me what not a nut is is this like hot dog not hot dog kind of situation going on Yi Xavier who I accidentally put in the recent donations in the previous video so I apologize Albert c stepan schroer lus z mouthless let's go Mattis mless hening ker camon jao cyber v r this is very incredible Uncle all the support hey thank you everybody that's supporting this this guy that's that's a good move you know for people that are trying to make these videos and all that the channel previously as usual don't forget to check out server leave a like or Rec comment if you enjoy this videoer just a casual Vier watching and I will see you in the next one awesome awesome and awesome yeah I'm going to like that video so PE some people are asking what's the point of n what why why would anyone want NYX to begin with a simple answer to that is that NYX allows you to have an experience in which is uniform and repeatable meaning that you have some sort of config which kind of looks like that Json like language it's not quite Json it it's not Json at all but it's a it's a functional programming language to kind of Define how you set something up and then every time you hit go it's able to reproduce that exact set of dependencies and everything so some things are really really annoying well anible is not quite the same thing ansible is more like how to set your system up and running versus NYX is more like it could be on a per repo or a per directory basis and so you kind of have this it's a much more confined way NYX is for people who still have children but are attracted to Arch this is true this that feel feels about right it is for people who are Arch curious but unfortunately they have children and so they can't use Arch but they want to be hip and cool still and so they satisfy their arch querious for some delicious Nicks I'm I'm a querious Betsy you know I can't help it hey the name is I could like Nicks I really could like ncks and t i I think you I think you said that right which is that Nicks the problem with Nick that I see in general is that you have to learn how to double configure I think if if you could get over the double configure problem I think NX would be really amazing I just always worry about double configuration many appreciations again the name is the primagen
