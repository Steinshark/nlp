so hello everybody i am very excited to be here with eugene voroleskin uh eugene is in many people that i've talked to many authors christian authors that are here in north america or in europe he is really seen as paving the way for the future of storytelling the future of christian storytelling his book loris has made a massive impact on anybody who is attentive to culture and also to like i said christian narrative and how it is possible to tell stories today um and so i'm very excited to look at his book because many of his themes connect with my themes this idea of the edge of the world the notion of a universal history all of these things we will be exploring together in this conversation and so eugene thank you so much for taking time to speak to me from russia right now thank you very much jonathan for your invitation and so the the novel loris is really amazing it's it's really is an amer amazing story and it connects both this ancient vision of reality but it also seems to at least in some aspect it seems to be talking about working out through the difficulties of postmodern society so we can see these images at the outset of the novel where the main character is made aware of these geographic limits of the world these monsters the sinocephaly the dog-headed monsters saint christopher we also hear of the voyages of alexander all of these references set up a narrative uh the narrative as an exploration of the limit and so the context is not just this idea of this limit in space but also in time because the whole book is layered through this idea of the end of the world or the different ends of the world that layer themselves on top of each other and whether we see this in this prophetic vision whether it's the facing of death but also even in the narrative elements itself we see a breakdown of coherence of which the main character goes through himself so this breakdown in in a linear way of speaking even goes as far as using anachronisms in the story where you see things impossible things coming from the future from the past melding together in the same moments and so all of this really struck me tremendously about the book and it made me curious about how you feel that loris is not just dealing with something which happens you know in the late middle ages in russia but also dealing with our current cultural moment uh well thank you very much for your good words about my novel in your question you rightly speak about the limited space and time about the borders and the border place a certain i would say very important role in my novel uh here so we recall we can recall another concept that is associated with finitude actually this concept calls border and finitude is a border and the border is not only what separates the border is also something that indicates interaction because it is possible to to interact only with a person or with a country or with the culture that is near you that is in direct contact with you and uh if we talk about the current state of the world then we can then it has come to the point where boredom's borders are disappearing between states between people so at first the first look that is there is nothing wrong in this but if you will look more closely on this problem with the loss of boundaries differences disappear differences between cultures between people between individuals and it was [Music] but actually this stage that coronavirus pandemic emerged you know pandemics have actually occurred before it is known but the world has never been completely closed i have a strange feeling that the current pandemic has been used by the world to rebuild borders i don't think that it is a conscious process rather it is a collective unconscious and it is a great problem but uh i try to try to say about it in a few uh in a few words and so maybe you will ask more about on this problem but what i want uh to say i will come back to my novel um the russian thinker mikhail called the space time system a chronoto my characters they transcend both space and time it is funny but one of my students a girl she whittily said that in this sense laura's is a chronotoplast because my protagonists they do with space and time what do they want they try to destroy both of them but they overcome boundaries for universal universal unific not for universal unification but they overcome them metaphysically that is they go whereas there is neither space nor time and in this quite overcoming of borders [Applause] differs from the overcoming which we call globalization yeah it's in loris it's very interesting because you seem to juxtapose on the one hand a confusion there's a sense in some places where there's a confusion of linearity and there's a confusion of space and time but the character seems to be moving towards exactly this transcendence which you speak of there there's a moment as if it always almost feels like he is he is losing himself in those moments where his memory is broken and he he had this injury and but then he comes out of of that moment and then moves towards a place where he sends he seems to transcend it but even on the on the outside sometimes that transcendence doesn't appear uh how can i say this externally as easily as we would want it to and so the last moment of the main character you know his death and the way that he has to be treated it might seem like he is losing himself but ultimately if you followed the arc of the character there he is actually moving into that transcendent zone at least that is how i i saw the the movement of the character you see the medieval people they had more complicated relations with the time and and eternity than we have they actually they lived that time lifetime was not so long 40 years 50 years we have exceptions of course but still it was not as long as now but still their lives were rather long why because in each fragment of their life they had a direct call to the heaven to the place where doesn't exist time or space and they measured themselves not with with such terms as here and now but they thought about eternity and that is and the time was not so busy as now uh you know in uh early um middle ages people they didn't use even a clock it was enough to see the position of the sun and it was really enough and the life was quiet and in this life in the center of the personal life was a god with eternity and in the center in the center of the social life was a monastery monster was so uh in russia maybe in the west it was a little bit another situation but in russia monastery was the university's school was academy of sciences and so on and so forth and this all the things they made the attitude towards time and space rather specific and i would say that we have a good example of the right attitude towards the time yeah we have i mean i think as as christians today especially as orthodox christians we still find an image of that in liturgical time where we see in the way in which time is treated within the liturgy and how we have this this kind of movement and apex towards you know the union of heaven and earth the a the union with the angels and also even the uh the again and again of prayers of this this cycle of prayers which which starts and ends and starts and ends we get a sense of this different uh this different perception and participation in time that infused the middle ages yes in lawrence i write about this interesting time of of christianity because uh so it is an uh common thing it is known that um the time in pagan societies or uh so so this time is not linear but it is a circle uh and that is why uh it was possible to hear this famous phrase antic phrase that his history is a teacher of of the life and why it was so because [Music] as the people of those times considered considered the similar circumstances they gave similar results and it was possible to live in this circle uh judeo-christian uh history is a linear history it is it is a time excuse me this it is a historical time it is the time that had its beginning uh history that had its beginning and was uh no and is always waiting uh for its uh uh last day uh and uh so but uh christian history is if i would find if i would speak about the symbol of this history maybe it is [Music] uh [Music] spiral yes because the same history has its rhymes uh and all the uh or not all maybe the most important things uh they come back but they come back in another uh drastic in another with another face you know this famous [Music] topological exege exaggerates of the church father's topology tupus and anti-turpos uh christ as a new adam um mary uh as a new eve and so on uh on the one hand this time was uh had its direction from the uh beginning to the end on the other hand uh it was um eternity dimension uh the circle and this this collaborating so to say of the time and eternity it is a characteristic the most maybe essential characteristic of the uh christian time and history yes i think i i was very happy that you used the image of the spiral because i really also think that very much so even looking at the final image in the book of revelation the image of the new jerusalem we see that it contains the guardian of eden inside its own resolution and so it is both a return to the beginning but also a transformation of that beginning into something completely new and so you do have this sense that it's it turns but it also it's always going up let's say into god um and so that that is definitely something if you remember in laros i have such as uh fragment uh all the uh try uh tries to explain what does it mean christian time and he makes uh circles uh around the monastery and uh then so the first circle was he was walking the second third he was flying not very high but still it was enough to make laura sure that the time is a spiral and so this this part yes they so this monk says to laura's uh you see now i'm flying not very high but no it's enough well that comment brings me to my second big uh question uh so which is that one of the most striking aspects in loras is how the book embraces a form of realism the type of realism that we find in all the great russian novels but also there is injected into it something which i can only call this magical aspect you know and the example you gave is one of them there are also wonderful examples of uh the holy fools who walk on water and there are many other miracles which are happening um and this is something which you know let's say historically for russian novels we would find in in someone like bulgakov um but in bulgakov's work in master and margarita for example these fantastical elements they'd serve a strange solipsistic fantasy you know somewhat like in the tradition of the surrealists or the late uh the late 19th century symbolist but in your work all of this seems to be integrated in a very different way as a movement towards what many of us have been thinking about what we call something like a christian re-enchantment of the world and so i was curious is as modernity as this the modern thrust reaches its twilight what possibilities do you see for such a christian re-enchantment of the world well as for the mythology in my novel it follows not a modern view of things but medieval one mythology is useful when something meets to make up for the lack of real knowledge you know moses describes the creation of the world and as a process that developed over six days you must admit that it would be strange if the people of that time would describe the creation of the world and man in terms of geophysics or genetics gradually knowledge is concrete concretized taking the form of scientific knowledge but this does not make any significant changes in the picture of the world a fragment i would [Music] i would remember a fragment of my last novel the justification of the island it will be published i hope later in english so there it is a rather strange dialogue between between uh a medieval medieval man uh and modern uh film director interesting and yes and they speak about the different consciousness about different [Music] notion of the world creation and everything that surrounds us and um he and film director asks this medieval man uh he shows him uh old man script where [Music] so i have forgotten this word in english something that flies from this heaven like a spaceship it's all right material a meteorite yes okay yeah meteorite and he says you see it was um the painter not painter so maybe a man who wrote this manuscript the author uh tried to so he uh painted uh this meteorite as a snake as a dragon uh and he said uh now we understand what does it mean this meteorite what does it consist of and so on and you can deny that for your contemporaries it was a snake he said he asked your contemporaries called a meteorite snake a snake and medieval uh protagonist answers yes i can't deny it is clear they called its dragon and film director asks or and now what you can say about our days he said now they called snake material that's wonderful that's wonder it's it's wonderful because i i myself have felt also that the modern categorizations are have become so um so so pointed that it makes it impossible for people today or very difficult for people today to understand ancient ways of understanding or ancient ways of categorizing a category especially a category like dragon if you try to reduce that to a a let's say a measurable phenomena that you can categorize with biology is completely missing the point of of even the way the dragon functioned in middle medieval thinking uh and so it it's almost like it's really two worlds that that don't touch each other very difficultly touch each other yes and their metaphorical language maybe they were not for awareness that it was so metaphorical but uh this language actually it gives no possibility to say that these people were primitive or uh actually the main things uh were uh known uh in medieval ages and now uh or unknown uh so we know the details uh but uh the whole we don't know and i fear that we will never know it uh uh not never i mean never in this uh in the on the earth it will come a day if god will he will show and tell us how it was but not here i suppose exactly um okay so i'm going to move on to my next big question uh which is really one of the things which fascinated me when reading loras and so during what people call the middle ages there was a universal history consensus we could call it it was a bringing together of different elements which included the bible christian legends but also included uh ancient mythological patterns like the the trojan war or alexander the great so for example several texts you know from the the aeneid to the eddas the arthurian cycles they all see their origins in troy uh gog and magog are found in alexander's romance muslims saw themselves as descendants of ishmael etc etc hungarians saw themselves as descendants of nimrod so there are many more examples of course and all of this culminates in text that we find something like dante's comedy for example where he tries to trace this mythological unity of all the ancient stories brought together with a biblical one so this mythological unity has been progressively destroyed by scholars uh through different techniques uh whether it's trying to find pagan to look only at the pagan versions of stories which were ultimately brought into christianity uh whether it is by using just historical techniques to show that this or this fact is not possible but there is still a deep desire for this kind of unity of story um and so we see this kind of interconnected legendarium or mythological world uh being revived in people like tolkien and we see it in many many other popular popular franchises like star wars or marvel comics and you know a harry potter all of these these stories which are very popular present us a kind of unified mythological story and so in loris you allude to this many times you you kind of bring it you you bring it to the fore uh into the story at these illusions to to alexander you know to these mythical uh creatures on the edge of the world and so i was wondering what you thought what kind of use you think these legends that have been mainly forgotten by many people but are still there uh what use they can be for us today is it possible to recover some of this christian mythology for our time thank you uh as i was hearing you um i thought about my translator my american translator lisa hayden she's a genius translator and so your questions show me how uh how [Music] sophisticated she made this translation and how deep uh he came in in into the text or and how deep she is in this interacting of cultures and traditions it is really a very important question because it shows us many things among them that christianity is not a futuristic futuristical futuristic religion it never pretended to come from nothing and it not only fought against the previous religious skulls but also incorporated this is how for example christopher ascend with the dogs had synocopholis arose he went back from he went back to the egyptian jackal god anubis and this is how he was portrayed in russia and say in ireland why because ireland had direct connections to egyptian monasticism and [Music] by the way with it it was amazing history of this painting uh it was um very interesting uh history up to the 18th century in russia christopher was with the go with the dog's head but metropolitan [Music] in the 18th century he interrupted this tradition and he said that instead of dog's head one must paint the head of the murder demeters and as his arguments uh he had a wonderful argument he knocked everybody uh with it he said that the life of christopher said that [Music] breast prostitutes wanted to [Music] somehow to to seduce him to him but uh metropolitan garcinia writes that if he would be with the dog's hand no one prostitute would come to him i suppose that he underestimate these women so dogs had it is not the worst that they have seen in their lives uh and but the story was rather funny uh and uh what else uh the pagan fest for example of uh solstice uh gave way to the christian feast of the john the baptist and christianity skillfully dealt with pagan mythology so the byzantine chronicle of john malala tries to synchronize the biblical biblical tradition with ancient mythology to do this he uses so-called fjmer method of [Music] so what uh according to the chronicle um uh he he turns that it turns out that chronos is one of the sons of noah and the father of the earth and it was the direct line from adam why was it so no because uh from the christian point of view it was only one universal history and no one history could exist in addition so to say uh if there is only one history uh one had the two ways to react uh or according to psalm consider consider the gods of pagans demons demons demons or and uh to fight against them or uh in incorporate them and christianity used both methods and [Music] what is interesting is that it was from that point of view it was a progressive thing why because um they this uh incorporation helped to to establish christianity uh and the chronicles who integrated mythology into christian history spoke with yesterday's pagans in their language and here you can also recall the first russian chronicle the tale of bygone years this chronicle uh demonstrates a special attention to angels why because it was it was a way of slowly uh transitioning from politics into monarchies uh that is why they were so attentive to angels and so on and so forth there are many many uh and other examples of this collaboration that was rather useful i would say and do you think that do you think that exploring these connections can be useful to us uh today in this post post-christian type of world oh it is a difficult question now when no neo paganism has become becoming popular uh when we are overwhelmed by a new mythology in literature and art uh access i says the situation in a completely different way at the beginning of christianity this was justified but after the establishment of christianity i see no justification for it everything was already said we know it from christ he told us all this only justification i see is to view mythology as a special metaphorical language uh as to consider it as the language of poetry really it is useful and nice i like this pieces of art that use mythology but in this case we must clear clearly separate poetry from the religion and not see any metaphorical metaphysics behind it have you thought a bit about because here in let's say in um in the in north america and in europe uh jr tolkien has been a very large influence even in terms of people converting to eastern orthodoxy for some reason um he tried to create a form of let's say almost a form of mythological structure which was not like you said it it was a poetry in the sense it was fiction but it was trying to show you know it was trying to show the coherence of the world through a fantastical lens uh in a way that could be that was palatable for people today in a way that people could could connect to people's imaginary um and so i don't know if you've thought a little bit about that type of approach in terms of art creation you know tolkien or for example [Music] this long legend about harry potter it is something uh something uh strange because uh as you know tolkien was forgotten he was not so popular after his death it is uncomparable with with the modern admiration of him the question lies not in tolkien the question lies in us so some pieces of art are forgotten for centuries but suddenly they have unexpected resonance with modern problems with modern point of view and they are exhibited so to say i i fear that it is not the proper word yeah yeah they're dug up they're brought back yeah yes and they are discovered for the second time even for the first time now it is time uh you know now really as you said uh we live in to my pretty mostly post-christian society uh and but [Music] human being can come live without metaphysics and so we differ from our uh brothers animals uh in this way so we need uh uh we need god we need uh we need to explain somehow our soul the phenomenon of soul of um thinking and so on and uh god uh is no more in the center of the uh birth of the life of personality uh nothing is not in the center of society and but this great wish uh to another dimension that is everybody feel this dimension not everybody can speak about it and so express their feelings but they fail and they find they discover for their [Applause] discover for them [Music] some sort of metaphysics but this metaphysics is not very high one it is uh so christian in if we'll speak just uh about ideas not not about sacral things uh if we'll take a great system of christian christian philosophy about the if you speak about the harmony harmony of [Music] christianity and christian ideas and when we will speak about harry potter so these are different things i have nothing against such tales so maybe for somebody it is a first step to another dimension it could be but the matter is that the [Music] this great thirst this great wish uh for for something that not from is not from here uh pushes the people to this uh strange type of metaphysics that was uh that characterized mankind uh before christianity many many centuries ago it's strange and a little bit funny a little bit funny indeed and so the difficulty one of the difficulties we have here i think is that much of the art which is considered explicitly christian for our culture is deeply mediocre the music the novels the there is there is something which there's a much of the art which considers itself explicitly christian has a bad smell it just it's there's something propagandistic about it there's something uh superficial about its metaphysics about its approach and so what is the advice that you would have to give to aspiring artists who want to use their faith or their worldview in their artwork but they struggle to do so in a way that is profound uh i remember the expression of my beloved writer joseph pater brown chester gilbert kate chesterton he was a wonderful thinker uh he was not at all dull have had a wonderful humor sense and and once he said that what lacks christianity is to be of chinese or japanese origin or something like this or from uh from the far east yes he said that for he said he spoke about the english society of his time but he said christian christianity is too too much at home here and that is why people they want to to if they have water as i for example here if they have water they don't uh drink they don't want to drink it is so easy to to drink water the stands near you uh it is better to i don't know to to go to the restaurant uh and to buy the identical glass of water and to drink it with another feeling yes and maybe people must be enough wise to [Music] to discover in old uh and maybe forgotten things the new [Music] new ideas new because bible it is a book that has everything uh if you want uh to uh you can laugh you can cry reading the bible i know i knew i had a colleague in germany he was a great specialist on the bible and he as he finished his uh lectures he was almost in despair because his students were rather so they were sleeping and but the last his sentence was my dear read the bible it is more exciting than harry potter that is definitely something which at least around me all of a sudden i feel people are getting more excited a little bit about scripture again and i think that the return to narrative is part of it because one of the the disservices that has been given to us by modern scholars is that they've sucked the story out of scripture they've they've reduced it to textual analysis source analysis and all these extremely technical ways of seeing scripture and they have forgotten or ignored the power of typological reading and the kind of narrative parallels that you can make when you read scripture in that way um but i feel like with even with post-modernism somehow that this type of reading is now possible again and the the exploring the strange stories and judges and all the very weird elements of scripture is maybe a way for people to rediscover the how wonderful and strange the scripture really is yes from time to time i read the scripture and as a writer i can't understand how nice is it as [Applause] for example this story with with 10 ill men that were healed by christ and his question that is actually not a question he said were not the 10 of the 10 healed and where are 9 he knows of course but this expression through the question it is so strong literally uh or for example uh i don't know it in english but in old church slavonic or in russian this um about naboo nebuchadnezzar nasser this wonderful phrase you was uh wait uh on the um how it will be in english uh the thing where you can wait uh the balance yeah like on the balance and it was weighed under balance [Music] by on a scale on a scale was the skill of the god and you was found very light yes it is incredibly good yeah and the the stories of nebuchadnezzar becoming an animal in the field those stories are astounding they're they're something that could be in your novel loris i think yes and uh you know in the bible you can find about the love solomon you can find you can find actually a key to the world history world history is not as marxist say so that some events they provocate another events they provocate the struggle of the club of classes and so on [Music] it is a time to gather stones and the time to uh help me uh to push you away right right right yeah yeah to to gather and to to yes and uh actually history is uh uh actually his history uh is just [Music] something that has its rhythms as a wave nobody knows why this wave comes uh and how to uh how to predict big waves and so on and as our writer liskov he wrote nobody knows about each man what thinks about him god and one monk told me a good joke about a priest and a driver or bus driver they after the death they met each other in the paradise and as the priest saw the driver he was a drunkard and drove his bus on serpentine and suddenly he sees him in paradise and he asks god tell me please i many for many decades i spoke to my brothers and sisters i i told so many good words and he drunk all this time and he he put in questions the lives of his of the people that were sitting in the bus and he's also here why and god answered him uh so all you during all your speeches uh everybody was sleeping but if this man came into came to serpentine with his bus all the people were praying that's so wonderful that's a wonderful it's a wonderful joke and it it also shows us as you said that the the secret patterns that are hidden in us are not sometimes they're they're not as easily discernible as we would as we would want and and certain certain action have con let's say have opposite effects that end up bringing everything nonetheless even if it looks dangerous at the moment nobody knows the ways of god and his creatures so eugene thank you so much for your time i really i really appreciate our discussion for you making time out for me late on uh on an evening uh for you we're definitely looking forward to your your future novel if if it will be translated into english just the little hint that you gave is already making me want to uh to read it and so i really appreciate i i speak also on behalf of of so many uh christian artists that sometimes feel hopeless really really hopeless in terms of the capacity to tell stories that are vibrant and alive and so i feel like you have given us some keys and some some some examples to to follow and to emulate so thank you so much thank you very much and i will i would like to send my love to my readers and non-readers and future readers and future readers and to express my love to america and american people thank you very much thanks
