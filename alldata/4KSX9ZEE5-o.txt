um i just wanted to share a few uh things that a couple of people in this uh you know among the other speakers have done already and uh have um i'm very happy to uh to be after after them in particular like hendrick did a great job about how to prepare a good talk um i'm going to give you advice on how to not prepare not to insist on the slides too much because they are only 20 of the talk um most of your talk should be the delivery consider this yeah i haven't been at the long long concert the great rendering of apacionata but i have the sheet music so i'm okay you shouldn't be okay with just the sheet music okay think your your slides are your sheet music or a play script it's the rendering that makes the difference right you shouldn't be you shouldn't not go to a concert on account that you have the sheet music okay or the broadway uh whatever right so don't forget us your slides are not the talk i am continuously baffled by folks who say oh i missed your talk can you send me the slides sure i'll send the slides like you know approximately nothing of the value of the the talk right so um don't forget that the slides are not the essence of your talk it's uh it's what you what you will contribute outside the slides so i'm going to talk a few things uh here real quick i don't have time to motivate everything the i've said for a long time that the most difficult talks to prepare the short talks which is uh paradoxical so on to uh the philosophy of tech talks there are two there are three uh levels of nirvana that i have identified um first competence and second confidence and show machine would be the third each has a long ramp leading up to it and each counts for a very big difference in your effectiveness as a speaker the competence is the one thing that you cannot fake in any way the rest you can uh so on when you work on your competence focus on understanding your material uh when we talk about confidence focus on teaching and show my she focused on on doing the performance part of the of your talk so the the competence you cannot buy still fake inherit you cannot there's no easy way to get knee and that's what makes you that that's what makes you you know be there in the pulpit or whatever on this on the on the stage make sure you have the competence no companies no talk i'm not i'm very i'm not kidding very serious if you can't if you don't have the competence decline the invite no matter how highly they think of you if you don't feel you have the competence you can't you can't do it study related work be able to defend in a claim in a court of law everything every single word you say be able to talk to someone whose life is that topic all right who sleeps eats and showers and you know everything is that one topic that you touch in in passing okay so you should be able to have a conversation with them be always one level about what you talk about don't forget that reputation is everything you have as a public speaker and that's how you build it with competence what you teach should be only so a small fraction of what you know never teach everything you can't teach everything you know you teach a little what you know and then the questions are gonna take you to the other eighty percent of things that you know confidence don't confuse it with self-esteem of arrogance i'm sure every people in you know that every listener here has a good level of self-esteem and is not arrogant so that's not about confidence confidence is how you relate to others uh it's you must be convinced that you are in the right relationship with your audience which means what you say is right what you say is interesting what you say is worth saying and your right person to sit to stand in front of in this case sit by the way to stand in front of everybody and you know talk about it truly believe every single guardian work is saying truly believe everyone's word you say if you don't believe it don't say it okay i noticed by the way there's also a matter of of energy if you wish people tend to fade out towards the end of the talk make sure the second half is better than the first half make sure the second half is as strong at least as your first half the best like the best like musical players the best actors the best whatever performance they're going to give it through the end with belief they're gonna believe everything they do to the last second so um onto showmanship each performance performance must be unique you don't you shouldn't have one talk that you can if i'm giving my talk on x right no you oh my my memorable token that in oslo was about you know this stuff and it was great because i don't know i fell off the stage or whatever happened right so make sure you get into the character make sure you think visualize for weeks before it mike tyson had a word he said for a month before a fight i could think of nothing but of hurting that guy right you shouldn't be there to hurt people but definitely should be thinking for for a long time before the actual performance you should be thinking about you should visualize it you should get into the character of doing it um by the way like i have no idea i can't fathom how people like were doing chicha just before this i could think of nothing i was drenching sweat i had to change my shirt i was drenching sweat for half an hour before this very 10 minutes talk which to you may be nothing but to me it's like oh my god i gotta give a talk i gotta be there like totally 100 i gotta be there like in the moment right so the top must take something out of you if you're good for anything after the talk you're not doing it right you should be half dead after the talk if you if you're dead on the stage then that was almost good okay if you're done on the stage after it that was almost all almost good almost adequate okay so make sure you should you can't do like uh golly you can't do it like glibly you can say yeah i give my talk and then i kind of i don't know i scratched my my button in the time i was fine and no nothing happened no i gave my talk and then i was like dead then and then i was like i lied on the floor and had no idea what was going on for like two days after okay strategy make sure you prepare material again competence define a small number of messages strong take away everything that doesn't doesn't support the point don't use the slight fancy slide transition effects animations all that crap that's not good for anybody like those transitions that take one second each how funny is it going to be when somebody tells you to go like 50 slides before the current slide right oh let me let's wait for 50 seconds until each transition takes it takes it does its job right the rule of three everything should be in threes three parts in a talk three subsections in a part three examples four principles three three bullets on a slide that kind of stuff this slide actually you know doesn't do that but that's fine yet comfortable comfort is is everything so people like to be comfortable and comfort and discomfort transmit like any like nothing else in talk so make sure you are you are comfortable and fake it pretend you're comfortable and you're gonna be comfortable i know it's weird but it's just what happens like there's any number of like pop science articles about that and that kind of stuff display that's why i'm emphasizing display ultimate comfort with every situation not not only in talk but that's actually a good tip for him and when i say display and that's why it's emphasized i mean fake it do you think i'm comfortable right now i hate it i hate i would die right now instead of being here okay but i got a display that i'm comfortable and just like yeah yeah you can just talk about stuff no problem people are empathetic news flash right this is not high school like people don't like to be feel shame like bad like the speakers feel i'm gonna be ashamed for saying the wrong things and stuff but your audience doesn't like to shame you like this again this is not like a situation like one of those weird like movie situations no people want to feel good and they want you to feel good so then you start with a good position you're in a position of authority or at the end of screen you have the microphone right you have the microphone you have everything it takes you have good karma you have credit you have an attitude from everybody that they they want you to succeed essentially so don't forget that the situation when you start the talk is rigged in your favor it works for you the opening is disproportionately important people decide within 30 seconds if they like someone if they want to develop a relationship with them if they want to do anything that's unspeakable with them you know anything with is within 30 seconds okay you should have a clear notion of that there's many experiments about that people can predict students predicted their final grade after 30 seconds of video with the professor okay so they could predict with 80 accuracy within 30 seconds you can't have 2 times 30 seconds first 30 seconds everything that matters so establish contact immediately ask people don't introduce yourself your name your name is on the slide don't say oh hi i'm john doe no you're not john doe i don't care right establish contact ask people a question tell them a story say joke do something that is going to establish some sort of a human contact with your audience make people feel like they oh my god i gotta be there because otherwise i'm gonna miss all of this great stuff that's happening in this talk right i hate it when people close with ah and i guess that that was it and it kind of just stopped there and kind of the there's a kind of uh uh perdendo see as they say in italians like you know this kind of the fade out you know right it's like oh yeah no you get it closed for applause like you know make sure you practice your closing and when you close everybody and their cat is gonna know oh there's the closing so i'm supposed to give applause and all that all that great things that people do when when the talk is done so practice it make sure you uh you you are there in you you're doing your closing properly any post closed message can wait you don't end your closing is not i'll be around for a few more minutes that's post closing your closing is thank you very much right and now go shoot me okay or do something that's your closing your closing is not oh you know and uh i guess that's it and i'll be around and by the way my name was john doe right no don't don't do that ever a few tactical uh issues again i don't have much time to explain things in in detail but please take my word for it attire i'm the last person to give you to give you advice on how to dress yourself make sure you're you know first of all like kate uh gave me that great tip make sure your uh your attire has pockets if needed if you need to have like a microphone and that kind of stuff on you you gotta have pockets so you can put your the you know the lavalier and that kind of installation in your pocket so uh beyond that clarify make sure that you're congruent with your attire your message is congruent with your attire no matter how you dress it's gonna send some sort of a message if you don't want a message just like bill gates because nobody ever remembers how bill gates was dressed like not one person in the world dream i don't remember if if you guys if you shoot me right now if you tell me your life depends on remembering the color of bill gates sweater in in the last like talk you saw any talk you saw i ca you would have to kill me because i have no idea i have no idea gate is like a floating head that's all i remember it's a floating there's no there's no he has absolutely no clothing and that's because he wears this grandpa i have there's a special factory that makes these grandpa sweaters of billions that convey absolutely no message so if you have no message to send dress like big guess if you think your old dirty t-shirt with a crappy joke on it and with that kind of stuff like like dirty and kind of you with with a bad collar and that kind of stuff that if you think that's i don't care about you know you don't it means i actually care about showing you that i don't want to dress nicely for you that's what the message really is right so don't be way too casual because that's not time so casual it's like actually i'm a slob right and don't be a corporate drone with the you know with the the tightest shirt and the you know the most fitted uh suit ever invented because then they're gonna send the wrong message on the other side of the the spectrum right make sure you handle your audience again you must assume that at least one person in the audience is gonna have dedicated their life on the one thing that you have to a little knowledge about right make sure you're gonna be able to make a conversation with the contact with that person validate but friend inspired them uh avoid a few people just hogging the entire interaction unfortunately it does happen you can never demean a person that's the worst thing any any speaker can do just uh make sure you address uh any questions they have extra you know in uh like in excess of what's uh what's expected uh take it offline with them don't forget you're in a position of authority don't exercise it it's just very easy to implicitly just acknowledge it and use it uh always scam for raised hands i hate it when somebody speaks for an hour and they look at the slides and i have my hand in the back of the room for like half an hour straight i'm like that guy was like and my hand is gonna get tired and stuff don't don't do that always scan for raised hands spray the audience with with the gays never say good question say thanks for the question don't put judgment on the goddamn question okay just say thank you for asking that it's the question i'm i'm it's it's very much to we appreciate that somebody asked the question don't judge the question oh that was maybe i'll say oh that was a crappy question no i didn't like that question no that's a terrible question never ask that anymore you're stupid okay don't do that okay always repeat the question for good form always and for many reasons it's not only for the camera or whatever and for the microphone that kind of stuff even if they have a microphone it's good to repeat the question in your own words so there's a clear contact between people mirroring is a thing very important in psychology so when you repeat them questions when your words back to them there's going to be a very good acknowledgement of the of the understand your understanding of that question always reply don't reply to the person don't look them in the eye and kind of like like an obsessed guy with a with an axe don't look at the guy and say oh yeah i'm going to answer you right now right no don't do that reply to look at the other half of the audience look at the entire audience and read and reply the question respond so everyone at the end of your talk everybody in the audience must feel that they have had an opportunity to shine to say something smart to understand something great to ask a question to make a point to kind of be in the moment everybody must have had the opportunity nobody should be just in their seat and say you know what i'm bored to death i'd rather be anywhere else i'd rather have my root canal done right now instead of being in the stock your posture it's amazing how many people just slouch like they search more than like if you have a normal conversation you get just going to stand straight but when you're talking the pressure of the tension of the moment is so huge on it that people tend to sludge sludge stand straight speak loudly with dynamics my wife always says like when i'm uh when i give me a talk like from home she says you're yelling yes i am that's how i am i'm sorry i can't do it any make sure you you speak loudly dynamics clearly use your enunciation whatever don't my accent is my worst part of me so don't imitate my accent at all right so never talk to the slides talk to the audience don't speak to the slides slides are not never gonna reciprocate okay it's or your audience look at it don't make me hear your drinking of the water please don't make me hear any any of that those gouts and everything no i don't want to hear that right drink while while being asked a question don't take a pause to drink and make sure it's not audible in the microphone record your rehearsals you will be amazed at how much stuff is going on you'll be amazed that when you thought you're giving a talk that was so engaging so awesome you're like a boring like uh drone they're just yeah you know whatever so people think usually the per the self perception of energy they give is a lot more than the energy they actually convey so if i have one tip for you and the one thing that you should remember is put more energy in your talks put more energy in your talks give more of you what you have nobody is going to enjoy a talk that is given half-hearted everybody is going to be at least is going to be sympathetic even even if they don't like you as a person because that's impossible to be liked by everybody even if they have something with the material they don't enjoy the material even you know in any circumstance people are gonna appreciate that the speaker gave everything they got and died on that stage right time management this brings me to uh um uh so otherwise speakers make this mistake of uh not managing their time very properly and that's a that's a big social contract make sure you finish on time thank you very much thank you andre
