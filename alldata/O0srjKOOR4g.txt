wow Nvidia you know in a way I'm actually impressed your sheer lack of concern for any of your mainstream customers it's kind of an achievement like you're in a race with Wizards of the Coast to see who can tick off their fan base the fastest and you're out to prove you'll do anything to win I mean Nvidia is practically admitted they'd rather rely on software tricks than give us faster hardware and the 40 series is not just overpriced it's more like hate priced and the thing is guys we know that getting outraged is not going to do anything and you know it's not going to do anything the 4060 TI was panned by critics and the community alike and still cost 400 somehow but if you want us to get mad then okay let's get mad because the RTX 4060 is yet another nail in the world's most overpriced coffee and we're tired of it and we're also tired of not telling you about our sponsor super micro the newest additions to Super micro's h13 servers are here powered by amd's epic 9004 processors with up to 128 cores an amount of cores that we're not sure is legal get blazing fast performance that handles even the most memory intensive workloads click the link below and upgrade your infrastructure today like it's bigger titanium mirror brother the 4060 is built on nvidia's ad 106 GPU and has 8 gigs of gddr6 memory so what are we losing when we downgrade to a feebler metal well for starters 29 of our Cuda cores for the main course 33 fewer Ray tracing in tensor cores and for dessert a sweet 100 price cut that makes it am I reading this correctly less expensive than the last gen card it replaces but it's not all roses those core counts aren't just lower than the 4060 TI they're lower than the last gen 3060. also lower than last gen is the memory bus width still at a piddly 1 128 bits oh and don't forget they half the number of pcie lanes which could cause a bottleneck for those still on pcie gen 3 platforms but look sayeth Nvidia the clock speeds are up and there was a big bump to L2 cache to make up for the dire lack of memory bandwidth spoiler alert it doesn't to prove it we put the 4060 and its competition through a brutal series of tests 1100 total tests that's right the labs is in full swing baby we've included a bunch of cards that are still topping the steam Hardware charts the best of amd's bang for the buck lineup and an Intel Arc a750 for good measure and as you've probably already figured out from the specs this is not a 4K card so let's get these results out of the way quick the 4060 only touched 60 average FPS in F1 and was anywhere from meh to barely playable in our other titles you could have a decent experience in older games or with settings dialed back to medium or low but if you want to play on high you'll have to resort to techniques some consider to be be unnatural sticking with Pure rasterization Performance for now though let's talk 1080p Nvidia made it very clear with the 4060 TI that they were not trying to make a card that is significantly more capable than its predecessor and with the 4060 Nvidia has extended they're not trying streak in cyberpunk 2077 the 4060 fails to outpace the 360 TI which is like the one card you'd hope that this thing at least ties with right to add insult to injury it even falls behind the now 30 to 50 cheaper RX 7600 from team red then we see the same story in f122 where the 4060 sits just 10 percent ahead of its last gen direct counterpart the 3060. the real star of the show then again is the last gen 6700 XT which cranks out 42 percent more frames than the 4060 and at the time of writing can be purchased for just 10 dollars more in The Last of Us Part One the 4060 at least beats its direct team red competitor RX 6700 but again fails to overcome the 360 TI and the more tests we ran the more true our observations became this thing is so bad that if I didn't know any better I'd say Nvidia didn't even bother to Benchmark to price this thing accordingly to peek at Vulcan performance we included Red Dead Redemption 2 where the story mostly stays the same but the arc a750 shows up with some impressive performance then in Forza the 4060 finally eeks its way ahead of the 36dt yeah yay I guess and return just confirms what we already know again overall the 4060 offers very little in performance over its direct team-red competitor and it does so at a 20 premium in price I hope the story changes when we look at 1440p nope we actually see the gap between a 3060 TI and the 4060 increase in several games and the gap between team red and Nvidia gets no wider and just like we saw in our review of the 4060 TI the 67 XT is Far and Away the most sensible option for gamers looking for Max bang for the buck thanks in no small part to its 12 gigabytes of vram to be clear 8 gigabytes is fine for most things today but that's unlikely to stay true forever unlike the pricing on water bottles at lttstore.com they're the same price no matter what size you like and mystery bottles are 10 bucks off if you don't care about the color but wait maybe there's a justification for all of this a master plan I mean we're five years into nvidia's Graphics reinvented Ray Trace future can a cheaper 60 series card give mainstream Gamers a taste of that technology as it turns out cutting so many RT cores negates any generational gain over the 3060 TI even if there is an improvement over the 3060. at least it still beats any of the AMD cards in its price bracket but the frame rate hit from turning on Ray tracing even at 1080p just might not be worth the bump in visual Fidelity for many gamers of course Nvidia does also have dlss and frame gen and we do have to give credit where it's due here when set to the Quality preset in most games dlss nvidia's AI upscaling technique is near indistinguishable from standard rendering if you know where to look you can find Visual anomalies but it's gotten good enough over the last few years that you pretty much need to be looking for them and the performance gains are very substantial this is where Nvidia wants to steer the discussion and for good reason using dlss at 1440p we are seeing excellent gains in performance with the 4060 finally convincingly pulling ahead of last generation thanks to one of dlss latest tricks frame gen frame gen Smooths animations by creating new frames in between the natively rendered ones though it should be noted that frame generation comes with downsides like higher latency and also just not being magic for example with frame gen 4K gaming is possible on these cards but we know from our tests that if you have less than 30 native FPS it's really not the best playing experience you can go see our experiment in the video Linked In the description with that said in older games or at lower settings I could see Gamers using nvidia's machine learning AI tomfoolery to run this thing at 4K the problem is it's limited to like a couple dozen games so moving on to productivity a traditional strong point for NVIDIA blender sees the 4060 look fairly capable for a mainstream card and the same goes for spec view perf where it's clear that the 128-bit memory bus is a real problem though it's worth noting this Benchmark is getting a little long in the tooth we are also working on getting some results from DaVinci Resolve but at the time of review driver issues stood in our way speaking of the issues what about the issue of expensive power whether gaming or running full boring applications like the rest of the 40 series The 4060 sips power f122 brings it all the way up to its rated power but that's just 115 Watts a significant drop from its Thai Cloud brother and even less than amd's 7600 in fact it's less than a 3050 if the price of power is a concern where you live then the 4060 actually could offer a decent value this is probably where the card shines its brightest and thanks to sipping power The Thermals on these Asus dual cards we've got for testing are also great with temps never exceeding 73 degrees on The Hot Spot which was kind of a lot of words to say Nvidia doesn't care about you when they can't book enough Fab capacity to serve the far more lucrative AI customers that rocketed their valuation Beyond a trillion dollars earlier this month but we gave this wet fart of a GPU a full review treatment anyway in hopes that sometime in the future it'll come down in price and make sense to buy that's that's just the best we can do which we know is kind of lame we said we're gonna get mad today but we're just out of gas at this point and I feel like a lot of you must be in the same boat I mean at a certain point Nvidia is going to drive their customers past anger all the way to apathy and there's one piece of advice that we can give Nvidia just don't let that happen you know at least if someone's angry at me I still know they care they're invested in the relationship they're holding on hoping it's gonna get better if they stop giving a crap that's when I'll know that the end is coming but you know what you didn't see coming this segue to our sponsor delete me in a time when companies are constantly sharing your personal information
