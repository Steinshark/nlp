- We are gonna ride this
Ferris wheel 1,000 times. And if we don't finish
by the end of the day, we have to sit on top of it for 24 hours. - We have to do what? - Come on, Chris. - Can't we do 100? - Nope, 1,000. What are we, normal YouTubers? - Are you guys ready?
- I can't wait to get off. - And we're off.
- It's so cold. - It looks like we're on a date. - We are on a date. (upbeat music) (bell dings)
- And we're back. - Is this full speed?
- Yeah. - Oh boy. - Lap number four! We only have 996 more. - You know what's the
worst part about this one, as opposed to the drive through? We don't have heat, and we got Hardee's every time we went
through the drive through. - True.
- This, we just get sadness. - Five.
(bell dings) All right, watch this, watch this. - Oh no. - Ah, what the freak was that, dude? What is that? - It was a dodgeball.
(Jimmy laughs) - I need a banana, Tareq. - A banana?
- Yeah. (dramatic music) (bell dings)
Thank you. - No, he has a banana! - Please don't drop a banana on me. (Chandler spits) (Chandler laughs) (upbeat hip hop music) (Chandler slurping) - Chandler's going crazy, I'm scared. Hey, give me that right this instant. - Hey, buddy!
(Chandler laughs) (crowd awws) (Chandler laughs) - Bye. - [Jimmy] Oh, close. (Jimmy grunts) (Jimmy laughs) - Update on how you feel, sir. - I feel like we're only 40 laps in, and it's been an eternity. Here, you want this camera? Here, catch, catch. (Chandler groans) - Chris, dude.
- No, I don't trust it. - [Chandler] I'm dropping it on you. Ready, three, two, one. - Ah, no, Chris, Chris! Ah, no Chris! - I panicked, I'm sorry! - The screen, bro. We cracked the screen. (bagpipe music) (upbeat hip hop music) And that, my friends,
is lap 100 out of 1,000. And to celebrate 100 laps, first one to get a ring
on a tree wins $3,000. Take us up. And here we go. Chris, start us off.
(Chris grunts) - No chance.
(buzzer rings) - All right, Chandler, go. Oh, oh, oh, oh! (buzzer rings)
Jake, your turn. (buzzer rings)
- So close, guys. We're so close. - Put some merch on that tree. We respect trees around here, please. - [Man] All the time. (upbeat hip hop music) - Dustin, is that you?
- Yeah. - Can we get two pillows? - For my buttocks, and a blanket. - And a blanket. (clock ticking) Really, really? We asked for those! We asked first. - Yeah, well we're on the double date. Yeah, let's be ghosts. - Oh nice.
- Ooh! (upbeat hip hop music) - [Jimmy] Where's he going? What is Chandler doing? Jake, why'd Chandler leave? - Said he was tired of this. - So he just ran away? We're not even on lap 300 yet, and Chandler already left. - I guess we're carrying the
torch by ourselves this time. (upbeat music)
- Psych! - Wait, take the G7X! - Throw it!
- Are you sure? - No, not now.
- Oh good. Chris is going to recover Chandler. - [Chris] Hey, little buddy. Not feeling good? - Yeah, my stomach's torn up. - [Chris] We've gotta do this, man. We're all in this together. - We're not, man. - Hey, come on, buddy. Let's make the walk back. - I'm still here. I'm carrying the torch for the boys. You know what? I don't need the guys. I don't need 'em. Are we still doing the challenge? - [Chris] You are! - I'll give him 1,000 if I
don't have to get back on. I'm not kidding. - Chandler said he'll give you 1,000 if he doesn't have to get back on. - Donate 1,000 to Team Trees. - All right. - If Chandler donates 1,000 to Team Trees, I won't make him get back up here. - I already got it pulled up man, look. 1,000. Chandler. - Guys, you see it. He donated $1,000 to Team Trees. - I did this so I could
get out of a challenge. I get so sick so easily, man. Ask my mama. - Good job donating to the trees, even though it was to
get out of this video. But hey, donating to trees
is still a good thing to do. - Go, leave! (upbeat hip hop music) - Hey, we're still doing this. Take this! - This tree is the new Chris. Ball me! - [Man] Bruh. Bruh. - [Children] Yay! - Bruh.
(Jimmy laughs) - Heads up! Heads up! Oh, I hit the tallest camera. - [Chris] Watch out, they're
about to throw a ball. Oh, here it is. Oh.
- Oh, it hit the water bottle! - [Chris] Oh, the flag. - We're going for round two against Chris. All right, Chris! Hey.
- Whoa, that made it! - Isn't it sad when
you're aiming for Chris, and you accidentally score? (Jake laughs) - [Man] Yeet! (Jimmy laughs) - [Chandler] Where are you
getting these oranges from? - I'm just finding 'em, bruh. - All right Jake, you ready? (Chris shouting) (dramatic music) - Oh, they're loading up.
- Yeah they are. - Get my balls. - Watch out! - That's the best you can do? Wow, who taught you how to throw? - [Chris] I'm trying to hit you with all that cage around you. You're too scared. - Yeah, well I got a new Chris with a K. - [Chris] Your aim sucks! - I have a new Chris. - [Chris] So do I. - Jake, you have three balls? - [Chris] He's probably
about to make it rain. - Throw 'em down while he's not looking. - [Chris] Oh shoot! - Oh, we hit you! Yeah that's right, eat it! That's right. Oh, there's an orange. Picked up an orange. Take this snack! (static crackles) I hit the camera. (upbeat hip hop music) - I'm hanging out with my
buddy here, Kris Mus Tree. We wanted to tell you guys you
should donate to Team Trees. A dollar, anything helps. Every dollar's a tree. Just make sure you donate,
'cause trees are awesome, and if you don't like trees, then nobody likes you. It's that simple. Hey look, that's
Chandler's car coming back. - About to get out and
just sneak on in there. - [Jimmy] Hey, Chris. I think I saw Chandler over there. - [Chandler] Can't see me,
can't see me, can't see me. - [Jimmy] I think I see him down there. Hey, you're back.
- You guys suck. - What'd he say? - [Jimmy] I think he's
making fun of you, Chris. - I'll show him who sucks. - Look at these kids,
suffering on the Ferris wheel. (door squeaks) - [Tareq] Go, go, go! - Chris is chasing Chandler. Chandler, no! - Your legs are longer! (Chris panting) I got asthma and my legs are short. - Oh! (pleasant music) - [Tareq] Oh! - Let's go, let's go! (people laughing) - Now, don't forget. Random people who follow me on Instagram, or buy merch, will be invited to compete in challenges for one million dollars, so. I forgot. Go to stopmrbeast.com
or follow me, love you! (upbeat hip hop music) - [Both] Yeah, boy! - [Tareq] Here. - You're pretty good at yeah boying. (whistle trills)
- You're out! - We about to wreck
this time lapse camera. (Jimmy gasps) Hey, oh! - That was a good hit, though.
- I know. Time lapse camera abuse for the win. - [Chris] Boy, you look
like a burnt chicken nugget. (chicken clucks) - Hey Chandler, have I told
you I love you recently? - [Chandler] I don't think so. - Good. (Jimmy laughs) I'm just kidding. Chandler, I do love you. Dude, he's not gonna accept it. Oh, heads up, heads up! (people laughing) - [Chris] I got that! - [Jimmy] Chris, you hit the camera! - [Chris] This looks so insane. - [Jimmy] Fully stepping off. (all laughing) - You knocked everything out of his hand. - Yeah, sucks to suck. I'm going crazy! I feel like Chandler. Ah!
