channel now let's get back to today's video thanks sponsored Gotham my friends it's Pro Frog versus Fabiano Winner Takes all the way the Ty Brinks worked in the Chess World Cup is that nobody could win in the classical so they speed things up as you see they now play two 25-minute games against each other then if it's one to one they play 10 minute games five minute games all the way down until somebody wins or they put on boxing gloves and they punch each other in the face uh Fabiano caruana has been the favorite thus far in this match he has had two games that were very convincing but he was unable to defeat Prague well he's going to look to do it now with the white pieces he plays E4 and he goes for an Italian we have C3 we have D3 and the players both castle and yesterday Fabi expanded with both pawns on the queen side today Fabi just expands with one Pawn on the queen side he doesn't move his b-pawn uh the Italian is a very big maneuvering game you have multiple elements of playing it you can play it on the king side you can play it on the queen side you can play in the center of the board uh it you could also you know pre-order my book at waterstones in the UK and use code Levy chess win for 25 off I mean I'm just saying if you're in the UK and you want the book and also so uh let me know in the comments if you're trying to buy the book in Europe what the shipping is if you're buying on Amazon because it is available on Amazon everywhere in Europe but I don't know if the shipping is like thirty dollars uh okay something fell off the table very exciting stuff uh Prague attacks the center of the board of Fabi meanwhile taking space away from Prague on the queen side with A5 and B4 he brings the bishop Bank he's still centralizing everything is looking good his position is looking good and now c4 this is a very big moment in this matchup will Fabiano break through in the first rapid game against the young Superstar of India take take Knight to F4 and by the way not just the only super not the young Superstar of India the only Indian remaining in the World Cup we just had gukesh we had every guy see we admitted all of them have been sent home one of which has been sent home actually by Prague Queen F1 and after a little bit of dancing on the queen side it suddenly becomes very clear that Fabi is gonna have a good time in the center and a good time over here with his Pawn majority he is looking to win the game Pawn to B6 suddenly prog's time at the World Cup is looking limited plays G6 Queen E1 Queen D6 the Queens have been traded and as you are about to witness these pawns are very very annoying and the more pieces that you trade the easier it's going to be for white to win but Knight E2 check comes in and he grabs this bishop take tank rookie one Rook surge trade it and Prague is on the ropes but he is blockading the pawns he is not allowing fambe to push them Knight E5 to trade these pawns off and now we have a rook in Bishop end game Bishop F3 Rook to B5 but look at Brock's pieces so ugly over there but he's Clinging On King to C3 King to D4 now C3 oh my goodness fabi's walking the king up the board the pawn is a square away from queening but it stopped and now Prague plays the clutch Bishop d Ube seconds on the clock he played that move because it's 10 second bonus he's giving up the pawns over here Rook to be won just in time now fumbi has to sacrifice his rook and come back and the pawns are going but suddenly they are both stopped Rook C1 Bishop B7 and now a race Asics Rook B2 check Rook to A2 and it's Fabiano caruana who unfortunately despite winning The Rook has to allow prox King in and frog is just in time to trade off every single Pawn that Fabi has take take oh my goodness H1 and the first rapid game is a draw I mean it literally does not get any closer than this my friends it is still an even match now Prague goes for a London system in his first game of 25 minute chess we have Fabi also kind of mirroring and playing a London of his own uh E6 C4 you know what these players will need after this matchup better help Bishop D6 you like that look at that ad integration in the middle they should pay me more better help just you know Pawn takes bishops get traded Pawn to C5 probably looking to equalize in the center of the board Queen to B3 by the way they've played three games so far and Fabi has been pressuring Prague in every single game but Prague has been there to defend himself take take pin bring the Rook bring the other Rook Knight F3 Bobby doesn't know what to do plays king f8 after spending nearly five minutes on the clock because it's very difficult to come up with something now Fabi grabs the bishop away from uh Prague grabs the bishop away from Fabi Queen B3 and now Prague is gonna instigate on the queen side looking to put pressure but Fabiano has been right there Queen oh my God getting into the position now progress to come back and trade the Queens as long as the A and B pawns are traded somehow it's going to be a draw can somehow Prague maybe keep the bee Pawn he's looking to win the a pawn it's getting really close the pressures building prong putting a lot of pressure on Fabi Fabi 50 seconds but suddenly all of the pawns fall off the board Bishop takes A4 but in comes Fabio with Rook D3 and he's just too active too much activity and progs pieces are all tied together Prague trying to do his best but unfortunately after a massive tactical sequence it's a second draw oh my God these two have played four games against each other every single one of them isn't in a draw and for the first time in four games Prague was never really under any pressure uh but he also was kind of posing no pressure Fabiano has been the favorite oh my goodness he has he has really done some incredible stuff now Prague gets another game with white you might be confused why that happens uh that's because of the flow of the match so white uh Fabi played the first game with white then he plays the second game with black now he plays another game with black then he's gonna play the next game with white and then he's gonna play the game after that with white and then very confusing just pretend like you understood me smile and wave down to 10 minutes they took 90 minutes nobody could win 25 minutes nobody could win 10 minutes they are now cutting it in half even more it's not half obviously it's 40 but Point stance E4 all right so progress tried everything he's tried D4 you'll remember that uh you know he just played a London maybe you didn't remember that and yesterday he played a Catalan but if you didn't remember that he just played a London you definitely don't remember that yesterday he played a Catalan by the way pre-order the book look at this poster I'm gonna listen I'm gonna I'm they printed this thing it's so it's awesome check out the book in the US and the UK did you know the book has sold nearly 13 000 copies already they told me that if it if 15 000 copies are pre-ordered it's going to launch as a New York Times bestseller there are still two months in two months we need to sell about 2700 2400 copies if you haven't pre-ordered one yet definitely do so in the States because you can't complain about shipping E5 Bishop C4 D3 and Italian against Fabi players developing A4 Prague taking a little bit of space on the queen side Fabi develops with the bishop to G4 and now there's a very provocative move Knight D4 take take and now Bishop takes and queen takes now that sequence of moves is equal you will notice that both players have over 11 minutes on the clock how many do they start with 10 looking like you how many of you play 10 minute games and play 50 moves in one minute how many of you play 15 minute games with 10 seconds of bonus time and end the game with 18 minutes on the clock and down 17 pieces you are behaving like an imbecile stop if you want to play that fast play bullet but these guys know what they're doing however opposite colored Bishops that is what remains in this position if everything else gets traded easy draw obstacle and bishop's end game very drawable in fact you can even be down two pawns and draw them get my in-games master class and also the book G6 Queen to end my merch I don't have merch but I figured I would promote something else now uh in the middle game obstacle or Bishops favor the attacking side why because if one side tries to attack the other the other side cannot defend on the same color complex so F4 now this looks great but it's equal obviously not getting anywhere but he's bringing all his pieces that looks good Queen F3 at some point he's probably gonna you know move another pawn and now here Fabiano plays D5 D5 intending to take this has to defend this so I can't also you know because I would love to go here but then Rook takes and the queen is uh something we call overloaded he takes D5 take take take and now this is the position so Prague has seven pawns Fabi has six uh but after something like Queen D6 Bobby's no longer any worse he dominates this file he's also got Bishop C7 and stuff like this coming uh look at this active Rogue Fabi in a fantastic position here and uh yeah I mean for a for another game in this match the fifth game I mean Fabi is just putting pressure on his young opponent Bishop C4 Fabi holding down the dark squares there's nothing here for Prague Queen F1 Bishop C5 take take and now Pawn to wait a minute prague's getting somewhere obstacle and Bishop end games are a draw in many cases but now when there's Queens on the board all of a sudden we have three King F1 King E2 Pawn to B3 but oh my God oh prague's on a roll centralized everybody that's weak that's weak that's weak C5 D5 oh my goodness and now he's won the pawn on E3 and now The Bishop's going to C6 and King D3 and King C4 and the king is walking no way Prague is going to defeat Prague is going to defeat five between F1 he blocks and the King's gonna walk to B5 the king's gonna go do it with his own bare hands the king is completely safe and now the a-bawn's gonna go the a-bawn's gonna go Fabi has to come back and try to defend himself but he's unable to because the queen cannot give the king any checks check infiltrate trade the Queens King B6 oh my goodness prognananda Ramesh Babu has two Queens on the board Prague is is going to win the game as Fabiano resigns he resigns with make coming on the G4 Square it's taken five games but Prague just beat Fabi Prague Just Beat Bobby oh my goodness now he has to not lose this game could it be true could it be possible Fabi now has to okay we have another Italian on the board Fabi has been the favorite in a lot of these games that was ridiculous that was excellent technique there from Prague now Fabi playing an aggressive Italian once again developing all of his Queen side pieces and progress to defend himself but remember it's a 10 minute game and Fabiano has to win he has to win and Bobby said about prerogative feeding Arjun in the classical he said in a must-win situation he would have given himself less than a one percent chance of winning with black that's what he said himself he was so impressed with how Prague played he said I would have had a one percent chance of winning that but he said that with black he did not say that with white very very different story rookie one Bishop B2 very very tense position at some point fabi's gonna have to go forward but it's Prague who goes forward forcing Fabi to make a couple of exchanges and now Prague is breaking apart fabi's position take take take take oh my goodness Rook B8 Bishop B4 Rook B5 Prague is the one calling the shots Prague is about to win the a pawn and he does oh my goodness prog has to not lose this game but he's about to win this game he's just up a clean a pawn Prague is winning Bishop back to f8 Rook B5 and he's he's just gonna trade pieces that's what he's got he's trading all the pieces off the board why is he doing this because he has to not lose there's no way Fabiano can win this game they have the exact same pieces but black has a past day pawn but Bobby's gonna try F6 F4 aggressive counter attack a bit of a gamble take take oh my goodness if proc takes on G5 Queen G5 there's mating ideas Knight H6 check various rookie fives the spawns just too slow could Fabi be making a comeback here E4 very nice move by Prague take take Knight F5 the night is so tricky here and proc has 30 seconds on the clock I mean many of us would have diarrhea here and and the outside of the chest we would just have an upset stomach Queen A6 the position is equal dead equal 20 seconds on the clock Fabiano caruana has very very weak light squares to work with Knight H4 Knight G6 possible the only thing that Prague can do is give checks and he is going to give a lot of checks until the Queens come off he's getting closer and closer to his desired result Fabi walking him down he's going to play H5 at some point to secure access to the light squares but unfortunately my friends after all that hard work 70 Moves of shuffling Prague has a blockade and there is no way for Fabiano to get through and ladies and gentlemen it takes 82 moves in this game but the players agree to withdraw Prague of India has just knocked out Fabiano caruana from the World Cup let me fill you in on a couple of other worldly statistics Fabi is now the number two ranked player in the world in this event prognananda knocked out Hikaru world number three Fabi world number two he is now the youngest ever World Cup finalist at the age of 18 surpassing the other records set by Ruslan palomariov I think he was 22 years of age and his final opponent is Magnus Carlson a man that he has actually trained with a man who is a Magnus is a big fan of Prague congratulated him gave him a pat on the shoulder after he knocked out Hikaru Magnus just beat gukesh and his final opponent is 18 year old pragnananda this is a sensational result the future of Chess hinges on this last year Prague went viral for beating Magnus not once but twice who knows what awaits him now but that is not the only incredible matchup from Bulgaria has an opportunity to get the Grand Master title outright with no requirement of norms no requirement of Elo I have never free I've never seen something like this she's an international master and she's on the cusp of winning the Women's World Cup she plays the London they are also in the this is it this is the finale in the Women's World Cup we have a critical Mainline take take and Bishop to F5 noorgil plays Bishop B5 and Knight E5 putting a lot of pressure on good Edge gonna Pawn to C4 damages Black's Pawn structure takes on C4 kicks out the queen and castles and from the early stage of the game norgul has a very pleasant position long-term pressure on this Pawn potential to expand on the queen side potential to attack also on the queen side with the rook and everything she brings the bishop back slow Improvement of the position karachina plays very forcefully but suddenly Knight A5 take and I told you a long time ago expansion this is very this is very simple terms Queen side majority you have more pawns on the queen side than your opponent what do you do when you have a majority you try to expand B4 say Levy how is that possible only two what what about Bishop takes before take take and when the Knight arrives here Queen D7 and mate or mate yeah so B4 B5 Knight A6 oh my God night night not Asic not Knight a to C6 castles salimova is winning and she she's been winning in this match before she was winning yesterday in the second game she trades the bishop take take all of a sudden the advantage is simply plus two plus three it's growing is just losing all her pawns this is this is insane salimova is upon up and the pawns are passers she's just going to go like this the game is over she's gonna move her Rook make sure she doesn't get back rank mated and she's going to advance karachina is on the ropes but all great players are like a cat at a veterinarian office they are so difficult to catch right as she is looking on the absolute version of collapse she Strikes Back and she brings in her queen with the intention of going here and here and harassing the white king white has to stay calm Queen H4 is met with Knight F3 Queen H6 is met with Knight F5 but salimova's time is ticking she thinks for a while and plays Queen to F3 down to a minute on a minute on the clock she tries to trade the queen but now the queen Zips over here and hits both the rook and the pawn now for some reason salimova does not play this move for some reason I guess she didn't like that her Rook could keep being bothered but then Queen B3 instead she sacrifices the rook and wins this Pawn which looks like it should win but garajkana hangs in look how close White's position is to being winning white now has to play Queen B1 to escort the pawns forward and cover the back rank she misses it and all of a sudden it's a Perpetual check the horror the absolute horror salimavo was completely winning the advantage in this position was nearly plus four Knight C6 she just had to bring back her Knights threatening this threatening Knight F3 and the game was over and she would have expanded but credit's a good adjuna for creating pressure not just on the board but look at the clock seven minutes to one a lot of nerves so it all comes down to this this is it this is the game to determine the champion D4 we have a Catalan take take excuse me take karachina going for this Catalan line and a very forcing line and responds by black A4 a B Pawn to A6 and we have a massive exchange C5 now you may wonder why would black play an opening where it looks like they're just simply going to lose a pawn like this uh well as it turns out the computer shows that this line is uh equal for black black accepts being down upon as you see here uh in fact being down two Pawns in this position for a brief moment uh but basically it's very difficult for white to actually expand it's very very tough but uh the onus is on you you have to make sure that you show how to hold this position salimova takes on C5 but at the end of the day is just the pawn up so this is the situation um well Bishop A4 Knight C3 and karachina is just gonna try to expand the B Pawn Knight D3 King F1 they bring their kings Knight D7 one of two things is gonna happen is going to win this with no problems or she's going to overextend and lose Bishop D2 Knight A4 white offers a trade of knights let's do the math you should get my in-game's master class by the way where I teach you that in end games with pieces on the board being a pawn down is not so significant in a king and pawn end game it's fatal also it matters where the pawn is if the pawn is over here all the pawns are on one side of the board it's easier to stop if the pawn is an outside pass Pawn which this absolutely is this is a lot harder position to play Bishop C3 if black just trades all the pieces it's going to be very difficult to draw the game so she does it this way she trades in a way that restricts the white pieces and this night she's threatening to potentially trap it so now B4 white reroutes the Knight and salimova fights back doesn't trade remember the more pieces you trade the higher the chance that you throw this game Bishop D7 or you trade in a way where you get rid of your opponent's assets that pawn is now dead now the only thing good Ash gonna has is this four and black controls a lot of squares with this three here comes the shuffling salimova once again in a deep time trouble but another Pawn comes off the board we're down to three versus two G4 Knight G5 you'll notice black is really restricting the white advancement Bishop F5 and now a huge moment Bishop to E4 offering an exchange of Bishop versus knight you will notice the computer is claiming that this is a draw while both players have now gotten to a point where they have about a minute on the clock white tries to make progress by walking around and taking something black does not allow that to happen King B3 ink D2 now you may ask why didn't karachina go this way and this way because you could do all of this but this comes in you could stop this but this comes in D3 and it's a draw King C2 but ashken has to find another way Knight B3 Knight A1 Knight C2 she's dancing okay she got that trade now it's a two versus one Knight F2 Knight D3 King D5 garage is still looking for a way but there's probably there probably is no way right because black is just standing in the center of the board Knight F4 this should be five she's finding an opportunity potentially the bishop is just shuffling G4 Bishop D3 okay I mean King E5 and D3 were both good D3 was good enough to try to play King D4 King C3 which goes Bishop D3 but now here comes the white king but now the bishop stops the pawns but now King F5 and King F6 and suddenly in the 90th move of the game the G Pawn has made it through G7 the bishop is restricted but here it's still not over you actually cannot rush and make a queen because the black king walks around and makes a draw so white has to play F4 with 16 seconds remaining we have now crossed 100 moves of action but white is faster and the King zigzags out of the way excuse me the Knight zigzags out of the way of the king these pawns promote Alexandra karachina wins the Women's World Cup of 2023. wins second place for her efforts I believe she gets a grand master Norm but not the title not the title heartbreak what to say absolute heartbreak an unbelievable tournament for her she now has two grand master norms and probably a rating of like 2430 she will get it in the end but what a way to finish today's recap Magnus versus Prague is coming up for the World Cup finale Ninjago and Fabiano caruana play for third and fourth place get out of here
