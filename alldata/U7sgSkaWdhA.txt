Norway chess hikara Nakamura versus Ali R fuja is where we will kick things off all right hikara opens up with D4 let me unmute the tab D5 from Ali razza C4 E6 Queen's Gambit declined chosen via the traditional Queens gam move order uh generally nowadays people are playing Knight F6 E6 and then D5 because white has to commit a Knight Knight C3 and Ali Resa here rather than playing Knight F6 plays C5 C5 is a very confrontational move and generally uh it is very very forcing and if white knows everything he's doing he will get a microscopically better position uh and the point is that you take on D5 take on D5 and then black plays very actively behind his two Pawns in the center and generally after this TR tra occurs let's say CD4 Knight D4 this is what we call an iqp isolated not to be confused with iqt I am thank you very much uh but uh iqp isolated Queen's Pawn you block the square in front of it trade some pieces like this like this and then you win the pawn but there's this line Bishop C5 and nowadays this bishop C5 line has been popularized by none other than daniil Duba very strong grandmas and black plays very aggressively shoving the pawn directly forward in the center of the board as you can see from the time management this is not something Karo had anticipated when he sat down to play this game uh obviously he wouldn't have been down 33 minutes on the clock he obviously knows what he's doing but there are a few Cutting Edge ways to attack Black's position here and as you see from Ali R's time management this is clearly something that he has prepared and he CaRu down 40 minutes is not eating noodles and pizza as Magnus was in the first round uh he's probably just not particular really comfortable Ala plays Rook E8 so he finally thinks a little bit I think Rook C1 is not the move the engine wants the engine wants he car to take on B6 and then it wants him to take the Knight which is one of the most counterintuitive moves you might imagine losing your light squir Bishop but the point is you win the pawn on D4 now as far as either of these moves probably black should UND double Queen D4 and now the prep can go even Rook d8 take take and it's kind of ridiculous because white is up a pawn with without a damage structure but the engine gives this position as dynamically equal because for example A3 Bishop E6 the Knight needs to move somewhere the only way it can move is here and this is terrible for white I mean white has no Advantage here whatsoever so Hikaru tries to keep more tension but the problem with keeping more tension in a position like this is black is going to be completely fine in fact if aliv res have played H5 here the engine really liked his position trying to attack hikaro on the same side if hikaro plays H4 the bishop will on G4 you cannot really kick it out because D3 is a discovered attack so you're going to lose aliv verza though just content with development and as what you know as one generally does in a position like this uh if white cannot get out of the opening with any sort of Advantage Hikaru did build up a very nice position but very active precise play and uh pretty quickly we get peace trades pretty quickly we get some more trades and we I mean literally the last like five moves of the game were just takes and then takes and then takes and then takes and then takes and then takes and then takes and then takes players agree to withdraw very good opening preparation from fua very good I mean not much to say honestly just a really really nice job and he gets black in the Armageddon which is a pretty big Advantage but not always right yesterday uh Hikaru lost to Magnus in an Armageddon yesterday fuja beat Fabiano in once again I'm not trying to insult anybody but it was one of the dumbest games I've ever seen in my life it was like minus 6 fuja had no moves he won that's what happens in Armageddon okay so this time we play What's called a slow SLO all right and one that doesn't drive a jiguli or whatever those things are called uh so Bishop F5 E6 and uh it's called slow because white is not playing anything too active now you go after the bishop and so far this position has been reached many many times according to top level Theory and now we have castles and uh alira trying to create some problems for hikaro again friendly reminder I was wrong about the time format uh the players get 10 minutes versus seven black has draw odds meaning black wins the game if it ends in a draw however on the 40th move they gain an extra second of time so it is an important distinction to make now alira immediately attacks hikaro the reason alza is playing in such a provocative way is because he needs to catch up on time to hikaro he cannot be down this much time so DC Bishop B5 and from the opening it's just hikaro a pawn up remember hikaro needs to play a couple of relatively straightforward moves and he does he is just up a pawn you count the pawns it's five for Hikaru it's four for alyza and uh he's also up two and a half minutes alza goes here hikaro plays Knight D5 I mean it's just a really tough position Bishop A3 is a nice move Bishop B4 is a nicer move now there is no mate you threaten to trade pieces after Bishop before before Knight B4 ala continues to try to attack but he goes directly to an end game Ali Resa tries to be aggressive with Bishop A3 and it lands him in a position where two of his major pieces are traded and he's just much worse he's just down upon Pawn he's down 3 minutes he continues to try to cause problems but Hikaru is just too good he is too good he is too precise B3 slowly improving alira is just down two and a half minutes and from wire to wire in this Armageddon game it was hikara Nakamura dominating and he beats alira fuja and he secures one and a half points the classical game did not go his way but Armageddon is a tough beast that's six wins in a row for white in the Armageddon so I mean it really shouldn't have been that high because fui was dead lost yesterday against Fabiano but Yaro does get this win and he's now won two of his matchups in the Armageddon uh and uh against Fabiano and alza now we're going to keep going then we're going to check in on Fabiano versus uh on Fabiano versus Ding and obviously we will end as always with our main event of the evening so uh humpy Koro and leting J this is one of the earlier games done this was by the way another Tash may I remind you we just had one of these and in this game Hikaru took took played Knight F3 G3 Bishop G2 and they played Bishop C5 let's see what happens in this one okay early dc5 so humpy does not play this she does not allow herself to be taken she plays this line where black gives up the bishop but wins the Knight and basically has more activity and as you're going to see from this game as well uh this and by the way this is all Theory I promise it looks really silly but it's all been played before um you can tell because the players are not spending a huge amount of time now they're going to start spending more time but uh yeah not not much as you know we immediately are in an end game and we're now in a rook end game and this one goes on for a little while humpy does have an active Rook but so does Lei and lay just gives a million checks and the game ends in a draw not much happened in this game so again it seems like the Tage is a very reliable way to basically kill a game now admittedly you throw your ability to win the game out the window as well um you basically just want to hold with black so now we go to Armageddon and will humpy make it seven in a row for the white side and this time she plays a sideline of a D4 that's how annoyed she was with L's repertoire I mean yo H5 is crazy that is a crazy move the idea by the way is that if white goes Bishop G3 G5 traps the bishop you go here you get this damage and suddenly you're getting obliterated here so H5 is a crazy move and now humpy plays this you know it's a bad sign when you've spent a minute and a half on the fourth move G5 look at this she gets the bishop but the structure is ruined this is a perfect game for black and an Armageddon why because white is going to think a lot look at this look at what hum be has to play Knight F3 and Rook G1 I mean when you have to think on your own it's a it's a really bad thing but Lei is also spending a lot of time she's now only a minute away from her opponent Queen F6 all right now both players dip into the three minutes and as we've seen Armageddon proves to be just ridiculous so Rook H3 Rook H1 and humpy's just going for the pawn black is defending both players have two minutes and I mean at this point it's a lottery both players have two minutes okay think about this both players have two minutes and both players have an equal position right the position's equal but black is playing for two results black can win and black can draw I mean this is an insane Advantage for white like it's uh sorry for black for black and suddenly humpy Maneuvers her pieces in a way where Lei is under severe pressure and hangs a pawn but it doesn't get taken the pawn is just hanging that's just a free pawn it doesn't get taken because Armageddon is crazy and now white is just making more improvements now the position is back to equal again and now we have a scramble of under a minute so the players have to make it to move 40 to get bonus time they do Rook H7 take take I positions equal but they have 30 and 13 seconds they have bonus time uh suddenly unfortunately Lei is just lost so what she had to do here is she had to play like B she had to break out basically and she had to lose the pawn but not that one that's what she had to do so Rook F7 King d8 and now you know if King E3 you always have Rook D3 check so she plays Rook D3 and unfortunately she loses two pawns and she's just completely lost and uh humpy wins a seventh game in a row for the white side so white wins in this game in the Armageddon as well now P cramling versus J and June Pier kremling having a great tournament putting on some epic fights this one Bishop G5 this is just a relatively straightforward Queens Gambit decline very classical opening Bishop F6 Rook C1 this has been played so many times p is playing that that uh very solid true and tried repertoire and I mean just gets a very solid position and uh not much to say here Rook D1 King F2 we have a trade two things are hanging here's a nice way to guard them because if you take on A2 I play Rook A1 and then I take on A7 and yeah we're just going to have some trades Rook A2 the Knight is stuck so it has to go here Knight C4 and now we we will make a draw Rook A1 yes J and June put a bit of pressure Pia had to be quite careful here make Mak sure to make the Right Moves if you go King G4 of course she takes you with check King H4 now you can't take the Knight because Rook takes Knight and uh very precise play from Pia very well done Rook F1 but nothing to choose between these two players as we go and there was a moment here Knight F5 check can you believe it when I saw this I was like what Knight F5 I couldn't believe my eyes Rook C4 believe it or not the best thing to do with with black is to just move the Rook like to E2 to guarantee you win this pawn and she went here and this is a deflection tactic Knight F5 check deflects the king and if takes then this is protected it's crazy and now white is just winning this is a winning end game oh my God I'm not even sure if Pia like I I somebody must have told her after I don't think she realized it at the board but maybe so they got a play on get in two so now we have another Queen's Gambit decline but this one Pia can't afford to draw so she this time she plays it slightly differently she plays it in a very aggressive way she plays Queen D2 Knight E4 which I've never seen in my life Bishop C4 and she gets a you know a slightly more imbalanced game and J and Jun this time is just trying to trade all her pieces and I mean yeah from the opening black is just the pawn up so J and Jun reacts to the aggression and uh she is just cleanly up upon Pawn white is not going to win this game the streak is broken unless Jan June like falls asleep for four minutes she's very precise very accurate brings her pieces in and cleans it up and she's going to get the job done King E7 no more memes at the end please J and June oh my goodness it's getting a little tense okay and rookie one and this is just a winning this is just a winning end game and even by the end of it black had more time and she just trades the puns she doesn't remember draw is a win the players make a draw and Jan Jun ultimately wins P I don't think P gets very mad very often but Knight F5 check is a crazy deflection tactic right at the end I mean right at the end I mean the players were headed for a draw for like 50 moves and suddenly J and Jun uh wins the tie break now Fabiano Carana versus dingly Ren was a crazy game in this game Fabiano Carana used can at its prep and he played into something that dingly Ren basically pioneered dingly Ren loves this line in the Italian all right he likes Bishop C4 the two knights Bishop C5 and Fabby chose a slightly unorthodox move order this is not really what people do they kind of play C3 Rook E1 doesn't matter it gets back to a Mainline position very quickly with Bishop E6 and there's this setup in the Italian where black plays A5 and Bishop to E6 allows white to Play Bishop B5 and now in anticipation of opening this position black plays Queen B8 and tries to put the queen over here and tries to open up the B file ding has played this a lot you look at the database there's a lot of dingly Ren in there and in this position Fabiano plays candidat prep Rook e 2 preemptively protecting the pawn on F2 okay from that idea ding plays Queen A7 because it's kind of the idea anyway way right and now Fabby uncorks the point he takes on C6 and he doesn't allow black to play A4 see if white just goes Knight F1 Black Goes A4 black takes space disallowing the side to come forward Fabby plays A4 himself and ding spends 35 minutes 35 minutes why because with black you want to push the pawn and you can't because you're Center is weak so you put the KN back you either play D5 or you play F5 and fiano said literally yesterday the day before this game was played he was working with his coach I believe it's Miguel Santos Ruiz I believe that is his name Miguel Santos uh and um I uh let me just make sure that's accurate uh I I think that's who he was saying but let me just double check this um yes yes Miguel Santos exactly right in fact they even kind of look similar so he said hey my you know he said what about Knight D7 so what about Knight D7 and and this kind and so it's funny because they had prepared this idea for dingly Ren the day before I mean you talk about procrastinating for a study yeah and dingly ren ends up down down so much time in the opening he's down an hour an hour on the clock and white gets this nagging pressure black is fine according to the engine but he's got to be accurate and very quickly ding gets into a very unpleasant position and you may be wondering like why is black not going C5 because of Ed the counter shot ding plays Queen B7 Fabby takes on D5 and just begins an attack just begins an attack on ding with with all this different stuff like doubling and so on and uh in the span of a few moves ding tries to create counterplay the best move here for black is Bishop H3 I'm sorry but you're not finding that I mean that's a crazy move the idea is simply to weaken the F3 Square that's it and the Knight E5 King G2 Queen D7 right oop sorry sorry sorry excuse me excuse me King F1 King G2 there was a discover check excuse me King F1 Queen D7 and apparently this position is equal for black just down a full piece ding is a human though and within a few moves he's under a massive attack he cannot take the Knight because of the pin Fabiano sacrifices on G7 very thematic absolutely bulldozes the king and he's completely winning he's completely winning because Rook E3 Rook G3 Queen H5 made or queen G7 you just can't stop the attack and first we'll go here as well and there it is you may be wondering why did Black resign check and you simply take on E6 or you even play Rook E3 Rook G3 the game is is over what a game fiano showing the power of opening preparation rookie 2 completely neutralizing this idea with A4 we're going to see if this idea from Fabiano is a kind of a shli thing or if this is a deep long-term kind of concept because this is crazy stuff this is really really impressive stuff and I'm going to just say ding has dipped below 2750 uh I should have looked this up maybe before uh below 2760 excuse me he's now rated uh 2758 the last time dingly Ren was rated 2750 is is is uh like is 2017 it's been seven and a half years so crazy crazy stuff and he's got a world championship coming up I mean ding he's got to he's got to shake the cobwebs off excellent game from Fabiano building his uh lead second in the world we also had Vali versus Anam musuk this was a uh the the final game in the women's side this was a uh aranel variation of the Spanish this was their classical game they played a bunch of theory I mean as far as Vali is concerned she played all of this all look at V's clock time finally she thinks a little bit by the way Bishop F3 Ed very sharp position black offers a queen trade and what generally happens in extremely sharp games is uh they pet her out and now we have a rook Rook end game with some Knights and Bishops and uh yeah Vali goes for the pawn blockades it very very nicely with her King and white just can't make much progress again this game was sort of like a very aggressive Skirmish and then a little bit of maneuvering and a keeps trying to poke through but there goes one rook and actually Bali had a great position she was a bit better but she misplayed it and uh she misplayed it for a move I mean like in this position apparently uh she should have played uh H5 and and uh you can't you can't win this Pawn if you're playing with white like you can't win it the pawn gets to H3 and now black will maybe even rely on the weakness of the H2 Pawn to try to you know end the D Pawn but yeah the game ends ultimately as you might imagine uh in a draw it was tense for a little bit but there was no way through for white so we go to an Armageddon as well I mean a lot of these games have like 20 moves of theory five moves of maneuvering and then the game ends in a draw that's sort of classical chess unless you you know bring an idea like Fabby in this game in the Armageddon Anna chooses to trade and take the game into very unexplored territory so she's going to try to make Vall think Vali definitely wasn't expecting something like this and yet and yet she's still quite confident she's still quite fast and we still go to an end game I'm not sure this is the winning approach to an Armageddon you know because black gets very easy moves now you know even if black makes an inaccuracy black is going to be a touch worse and it's like it's hard to prove a two and a half minute time advantage and this this is just not the way I mean Anna I'm not really sure why Anna rushed so you know so quickly to trade the pieces there's a very good like even here you know like she plays a very sharp line but black kind of knows the theory and and yeah now now white you know is uh is trading Rooks and and you're you're just not going to win this position 95 and very quickly Vali just totally takes over and uh as we see happen sometimes deadlock absolute deadlock King here take take it's just a drawn end game and uh B makes a draw Vali wins in the Armageddon and speaking of Vali here is another uh here is another I was going to say uh another member of the uh ra rames Babu F uh what am I I I'm gonna have a sip of my smoothie how about that okay of the ramage Babu household and um Prague versus Magnus couple of years ago Prague beat Magnus for the first time and it was a sensation it was a rapid format I believe it wasn't classical if I'm not mistaken and that was a huge deal I mean it just it it and he's since he's beaten him a handful of other times in these formats and so has gukesh and it's sort of become like all right yeah you can beat Magnus like you can do it it doesn't have to be a crazy story every single time but Magnus himself has said that Prague is like the future he thinks that Prague is uh is destined for greatness and so let's see what happens when they play a classical game of chess against each other so we have E4 we have C5 and Magnus opts for a con Sicilian this is rare one of my favorite things to do is to go to chessgames.com say player with black is Carlson and the opening is uh Sicilian Khan 15 games including the one today he's played a few over the last few years bro he doesn't play this opening like half half of those games were played in 2002 he doesn't play the pulson KH but it's impossible to prep against Magnus because he knows every opening right the idea of the pulson Khan is for black to play like B5 Bishop B7 and so on so we have Bishop D3 okay Bishop D3 is one of the moves and now we have Queen C7 which is one of the moves right we have Queen C7 notice Magnus thought for a while that's because the move order Queen C7 is not the most popular black likes to play Bishop C5 here it's the most common move and then here black likes to move the bishop back to one of those squares Bishop D3 kind of is one of the main lines it's one of the most challenging weapons and Magnus doesn't play B5 but rather plays like this he takes the six rank setup he kind of takes the Hedgehog the spiky six six setup sixth rank setup C4 is a nice idea always a common idea in this opening Knight C3 and now Knight E5 you're going to notice this move comes after 17 minutes of thought this move comes after another five so Knight E5 trying to get the bishop trying to put pressure here making it difficult for for pro to BL moves like this because now B5 there's a hanging Knight here right that's kind of where like Magnus has him exactly where he wants him he's playing a young man who doesn't have like such a deep level of experience in this kind of 2hour time control he immediately has him out of his prep and H3 is on the board the other idea is to play a four and basically just go for it prong said he didn't like this very much because he wanted to be patient he wanted to wait a little bit he didn't like that sometimes the G4 sare is weak so he said you know what I'm going to play H3 and H3 at this point Magnus went to the confessional booth and said he feels Prague is being tentative so he played B6 and he's trying to play Bishop B7 and put pressure on the C4 Pawn again like I told you six rank setup it's called the Hedgehog it's a very interesting setup very Pokey setup and now he's really baiting Prague into this move F4 Prague has all his pieces across the center Knight D3 Queen D3 and now black can play F uh Bishop E7 Bishop D7 and short Castle as well as put the Rook on C8 can also put the bishop on B7 the bishop has to go here anyway right so this is clearly a very provocative setup from Magnus who is is baiting prag to playing F5 because that's going to get a fight that's going to get a fight going if white Waits black plays Rook C8 and then you cannot play B3 because of B5 again I mean you can there's some you know you might even have some sacrifices but in general you should probably play Rook C1 because if Queen C4 you have various tricks Knight D5 E5 like white gets a very powerful initiative so that's another way that the game can develop with Rook C1 at that point black will go here and again you can wait with white but black will castle and at that point it's too late at that point it's you waited too long you don't have a breakthrough and then black is going to start taking over so prog goes F5 says you know what Magnus I'm down 30 minutes but you got what you asked for you wanted a fight the only thing that white can the black can do here is to play E5 only thing can't take can't ever take Knight comes to F5 pressures everything you're not going to get developed you also cannot really ignore me if you go here I build behind my pawn and I'm just threatening to win I mean this is just a this is this is over like resigns so F5 E5 actually Magnus did play Queen D7 F5 E5 is what he should have played F5 E5 is what he should have played why because then black has time for Rook C8 and then black has time for moves like Queen C5 and the bishop Bishop is blocked very important small detail very important F5 now E5 the bishop the Knight comes back and now you play Rook C8 Queen C5 you don't allow the bishop go to go here for example Bishop B7 actually Bishop G5 now is also very good why D5 million dollar Square in the Sicilian if you can dominate D5 which white controls with five pieces right so weak Square backwards Pawn a pawn whose neighbors have abandoned it and the square in front of it cannot be controlled by any pawns backwards Pawn it's not a move you want to play but guess what it's a move you're going to have to play pretty soon and this is a major provocation from Magnus who's suddenly in trouble he should have played E5 sooner and suddenly Prague has an incredible position he doesn't it doesn't matter that he's down 30 minutes Rook C8 is a Counterattack and Prague finds the best and only move which is so counterintuitive it doesn't even begin to make sense Queen E2 the idea of Queen E2 is insanely deep it's very straightforward though once you realize it it's to play E5 it's to put the Rook opposite the queen while maintaining defense of the C4 Pawn if black plays Queen C7 you lose the pawn here too much tension in the position white has 1 two three four five six seven pieces black has 1 two 3 four five white overwhelms black that's simply it white is overwhelming the black position and now Magnus makes this move and the reason before he needed to make this move is like I said you would have blocked the bishop now you're still a little bit unpleasant here but you block the bishop what happens in this game is that Prague gets all his pieces out and suddenly he has a squeeze on D5 a death grip like he is Never Letting Go Knight E3 Bishop G5 already at this moment Magnus needs to very urgently create counterplay King H1 is cold blooded what he's saying with this move is takes takes you can't take on C4 because you lose one Pawn you lose two pawns not right away because then you would lose a rook but just in general but really this is the problem the problem is where's your king going where's your king going GF is positional I mean you just lose everything you lose all your pieces Queen E3 which is why now Magnus plays F6 himself and he is just a moment away he is a moment away from consolidating be E3 now he plays B5 he's still not consolidating he's trying to create some problems before he castles best move from Prague Knight to D5 and this is it you can't Castle anymore because Knight E7 is a fork okay fine best move Queen C5 let's offer a queen trade of course prog says no he's heading this way you still can't Castle because of Knight E7 so what do you do to be honest with you the engine here just wants King F7 but that's a really miserable move to make and you walk directly into an attack anyway the queen C5 Queen F3 BC and now he wins time this is such a deep concept you see here if bc4 and bc4 now black takes the Knight Rook D5 Queen C4 Rook D6 and finally Magnus castles 27 moves into the game he will Castle his King however if bc4 B4 which is another very nice idea Queen C6 and at least least Magnus is a pawn up and it's a pass Pawn good luck attacking him King f8 but Prague finds the best move a move that he CaRu and other Grand Masters watching this game were impressed with he leaves the queen side alone time time is of the essence Rook F3 time is of the essence you can take on B3 I will take and then I will continue to come back over here and create this attack Magnus didn't like this at all tries to get rid of the Knight Rook D5 Queen B6 and now prog takes his King is safe Rook is coming here but the Rook is also going across the third Rank and creating problems Magnus is without a rook and that ultimately is the difference Prague faked an attack he fainted right he fainted the punch and immediately went to the other side of the board and guess what happens my friends it's over you are playing an endgame down a rook and the one final dagger the one final dagger in this position is Queen D1 and the plan is very simple here here resignation Queen B1 Rook B8 Rook B7 resignation you do have to be careful it's never too late to blunder a Perpetual check luckily this is not but Queen D1 G6 Queen B1 black does not have time he is butchered on the seventh and eighth ranks King H look at look at this move no more checks if you play any move like Fe Queen F1 you can't stop mate I mean it's unbelievable Fabiano uh Fabiano pragna rames Babu Fabiano rames Babu I mean this the kind of day we're having Bob uh I almost said it again prag Nanda rames Babu just defeated Magnus Carlson in a classical game of chess the first of his career I believe I don't think I'm forgetting but these guys play so many games against each other I believe the first time he beat him in it became world news was in a rapid format but that was two years ago at this point and uh the future is now and the craziest part about this game is that Magnus Carlson I was looking at magnus's classical chess game stats they are astounding the last time Magnus played Norway chess he lost 18 fed points Magnus is currently at his lowest ELO in 14 years and the young guys are coming I mean they are hungry and they are not not showing any signs of stopping and these are your standings on the women's side Vali the sister is winning the tournament and the two Chinese women behind her and look at this Prague is winning on the other side incredible stuff absolute scenes incredible incredible stuff my friends thank you so much for watching the third recap I can't believe it Prague just beat Magnus in a master class of a game what a game I mean just simply what a game and uh yeah thank you so much for those of you supporting the patreon I will now record uh some more stuff some puzzle stuff for for the patreon uh and those of you that already are subscribed there you should be sure to check it out so I'll see you for round number four get out of here
