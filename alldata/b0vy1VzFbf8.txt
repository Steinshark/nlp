Colton what are you doing bud I need to network my gaming PC my Wi-Fi is kind of spotty and I was going to run ethernet over here but my wife keeps telling me I can't leave cables on the floor for people to trip on so what you're gonna put them in the walls yeah well Colton your walls are already full of cables oh this is really cool obviously Colton's right in a perfect world we would run ethernet cabling through the walls to every desired endpoint in the home it's fast and cost effective at least it is for new construction depending on when your home was built it may simply not be viable to network up your house with Cat5e or Cat6 cabling even if Wi-Fi isn't an option for your house due to its size composition or proximity to noisy neighbors there are other Solutions your walls might not have network cabling in them but they are chock full of other kinds of cabling some of which are capable of carrying network data with the appropriate adapter so we're going to take a look at two of the most popular options Powerline and mocha and see which one works best for Colton and we're going to see what works best to tell you about our sponsor simple mdn simple MDM is a ridiculously simple Apple device management tool for it enrolling your company's Apple devices and keeping them up to date doesn't have to be frustrating try it for free for 30 days on unlimited devices at simplemdm.com Linus the two solutions we're going to be comparing today are mocha which uses those coax cables that you might have in your walls from when people still had cable TV and Powerline which uses your power lines they both offer similar performance at two and a half gig and 2 gig respectively they both operate using similar principles that is to say using RF signaling over the existing wiring in your walls and they both have a similar cost since it's less likely to be susceptible to interference from a dirty power grid or say hi draw or misbehaving appliances within the home fortunately I think that's going to work for us today because you happen to have a coax Jack here and since Colton used to have cable internet there should be a coax cable next to your modem let's go have a look yes do you want me to move my stuff out yeah first things first let's get this exercise bike the let's see how let's see how big the layer of dust is on the bike it's not that bad I just we just cleaned everything here it's not that bad oh so not because you use it but because you cleaned it no I don't use it I was like way to make it way way to reinforce what he's saying this is to show that I could exercise and that I have an interest I just don't so to show that you have no excuse yeah exactly cool I did try to vacuum over here though less dog hair than last time although these things are really cool for cable management I bought off I bought them off Amazon let's see how much hair they take in them oh it's not bad look that's way better than it used to be this is an improvement from every other video we've ever done together yes yes wait where is your coax oh my God okay my coax used to be inside of here but then the fiber now yeah so where's your coax probably in there it used to be in there I think it's in the box outside Lions this is a nice screwdriver where'd you get it from lttstore.com oh I don't have good news folks there's just a little it's like in there the little fiber guy I don't want to pull uh oh this is bad there's a lot of resistance yeah can I just see yeah you take a look this could be bad okay what what is on the other side of this wall the garage oh crap well we need to find it okay okay sounds good we're heading to the garage all right oh no my garage is gonna be on camera nice Tesla charger how's your model three it's totaled gone [Laughter] what an unbelievable person what are you doing you moving that out of the way I do you need a flashlight I have some news for you what's the news brother the news is that I found your coax cable oh oh so they literally pulled it out of the oh yeah this is it oh nice so here's your fiber line which we should definitely not pull on then because there's not a lot of slack oh no it might be this one is this one yeah it's that one here's your fiber line then and here is the coax cable that used to go through this hole very nice how many holes you want to put in the wall today oh however many we need to go for anything for content do we just have to drill a hole through the thing yeah oh that's fine and you have some yeah oh that oh yeah that's what you mean yes yes yes yes yes yes like a-u-l-k as long as we listen there's space between this wall and the next wall yeah like do you want it to come out in the room yeah yeah there's like there's like it's like yeah okay yeah yeah we're just gonna go but are you going all the way through the wall oh yeah yeah let's go have a quick looky Boo at the other side no drill first then you go on the other side buddy I'll start knocking I'll start knocking you just aim for my hand what could go wrong no please don't do that this is great because you're just gonna put a plate here so the hole like it doesn't even have to be accurate oh we just go we don't think there's anything else behind there what if there's Plumbing behind there just like Plumbing to what should skip it okay all right you got the spot hold on I need my glasses I need my goggles what you got glasses on what are you doing I know what are you talking about okay okay I'm gonna wait for it on the other side I'll turn on my camera all right sounds good okay all right buddy you ready David yeah all right three two one drill ah some damage hello hey lioness halfway through the [Laughter] you did a great job great job Colton did you cook the cable sir no are you gonna well you did I mean we just want to Hole In The Wall I mean we can make more holes in the ball crap buddy buddy well okay hold on you're close you're close one sec one sec I'm not moving uh okay put it back where it was that mean I don't know twist it try twisting it twist it okay push oh yeah yeah got it let's go fun facts by the way you can still have cable TV and cable internet and mocha it's just that the more devices that you have running on your coax lines well the lower the performance might be my understanding is that if you have Dish it uses the same frequencies as mocha so you could run into trouble but in most cases it should be fine hey Colton you got an ethernet cable also we need the power adapter for this I will have to find it oh wait no it includes one hey hey sounds good wow that is not a particularly confidence inspiring ethernet cable but that's fine yeah it will do gigabit what you're looking at then is the fiber line coming in from the street going into our modem router Wi-Fi combo unit then just like you would normally plug in a computer we've plugged an ethernet cable into the back of it and instead of running the other end to the PC we're running this end to our go coax adapter which converts it from ethernet to coax now we just got to put one of these on the other side this has built-in mocha oh that's sick we actually don't even need the second adapter then we can put this one on the other side that just saved us 50 bucks hold on a minute I mean well um I don't know what standard of mocha that supports so I'm probably going to want to come back and test it with these on both sides after but let's try it like this and just see what happens after you roasted our PCS I went ahead and cleaned my computer clean cleaner it's like gonna light on it's on fire I bought that off Amazon it's Amazon Basics no that's not what I mean I just mean all the like lint next to it oh yeah the spark that's basically Tinder what are you doing with Tinder that's funny so just all the cringe now we're looking at basically the same thing on the other side that coax cable from the other room goes into the main Distribution Hub for the house and then there's another cable that runs from there over to yeah yeah unfortunately we're actually not getting indicator lights for either our land connection to the PC or mocha and this is where things get a little bit dicey think about it if you were using a technology like mocha in say for example an apartment building what would prevent everyone else in that building from getting access to your network nothing thankfully we've got encryption so we're going to be using MPS which is for mocha protected setup to essentially pair our mocha adapters by having them share the same encryption key it works in much the same way that WPS does for Wi-Fi check power LED is solid Lan LED is blinking um yeah no this should be working can I have another one of these go coaxes just in case I don't know if any of this troubleshooting is going to make it into the video maybe a float plane exclusive or something yeah but dude I think your Lan Port is dead you got drivers and everything it doesn't light up but I plugged in just my USBC Network dongle and immediately the Lan light goes on so oh wow okay we can try just reinstalling your drivers in the meantime I want to get mocha working yep I'm just going to use this at least it should be that simple to add devices once we've got our Network configured in order to configure our Network we first have to reset our device which is very easy obviously you can see that just gotta poke this hole for 10 seconds when the thing is inside a tiny little recessed hole it doesn't need to be held for 10 seconds manufacturers that's not going to get hit by accident hey there we go gold coax by the way isn't the only brand of mocha adapter so they just happen to be the one that we're using today within the control panel the most important things you're going to set are a new password for the admin control panel itself and new encryption keys for the d-band mocha that we're using so we're going to go ahead and go coax as the old one and then I'm also going to set a static IP the better way to set a static IP is through your router not through the device but I'm lazy and this is Colton's house now we reboot the device if you've worked your network settings and it doesn't work well you can always factory reset it and try again before you panic though don't forget to go back to the network adapter that you configured manually and set it back to DHCP now we've made our way into the dashboard for the Telus router and there is no obvious way to use MPS so I give up Colton can just spend another fifty dollars and we're going to use a second Goku Xbox on the other side what's that what's the conclusion here guys I'm not going to try to use the built-in mocha on your router oh okay I'm just you're just going to buy another one of these okay sounds good yeah cool this is the part where we find out if Colton's house is even mocha compatible at all what some of the wiring in these walls is just let's say very random like these cables may not actually go back to a central location and if they don't we're hooked is there any indicator that it's doing anything yeah if the mocha light turns blue uh the mocha light is not on at all it's not on at all yeah this could be bad it's not great they called me might have put a hole in your wall for no reason at all well that's okay it was fun it's all about the journey not the destination yeah something but in this case it was about the destination but we didn't get there yeah yeah well we're defeated if you have working cable internet or TV in your house you shouldn't run into a problem like this but it seems like Colton's cable box here um it requires a tool that is only three dollars but we simply don't have to open it up and check fully we did do a test before we came here and while mocha does add some additional latency it's more consistent compared to Wi-Fi which is better for gaming and it's wicked fast the thing to note though is that if you add more than two mocha adapters to your home they function like a hub meaning that each transmission goes to every other node on the network meaning that there can be a lot of overhead so that advertised two and a half gigabit gets consumed pretty fast as you start to scale Beyond three four five devices Powerline which is what we're going to attempt now works in much the same way but is a little more flexible because you can put it anywhere with a power plug as long as they're all going through the same breaker and the speeds at two gigabit per second are at least hopefully comparable and definitely enough for us where we only need the two endpoints let's go try it from my previous experience with it Powerline is a lot more Plug and Play basically you take this here thing you plug it into darn it Colton what happened there's no extra power outlet ideally you wouldn't run it through a power strip and I'd really like to have one of these um do you have two power strips here Colton yeah oh my God you have so many things plugged in I do guilty as charged is there another car no not easily accessible what's up just unplug something What's your deal yeah you know what really I don't even care anymore what here you go Colton was that my monitor boom Oh boom what was that don't even trip and just like that wait what is this actually how this works yes this is actually how this works oh right my ethernet ports dead what a what a wow you can do a lot of things now we're going in here no cables across the hall let's go oh God we really did put an extra hole in your wall of Colton it's okay we're just gonna put wood filler on it it'll be okay wood silly yeah wood filler it's fine okay that's fine or we'll hang a painting little one world's smallest you know what not my house what hey hey wait what don't worry about it what's going on what are you doing about it there Wireless interwebs yeah well wired interwebs yeah wired but with different wires yeah this is so much better than Wi-Fi I'm serious I've used this stuff before it can be great Colton's just cursed we even upgraded his Wi-Fi once you remember that that was a whole video it was and that was it it really was that simple this whole video could have been 30 seconds long let's go no no enough no this is gonna be basically exactly the same not that we even did it before test because that doesn't matter but that's you probably have a hundred yep that's yeah that's close to what it was this is where things get impressive now remember how our ping times were all over the place before jumping up to 20 25 milliseconds look at that just 10 Steady As She Goes that's the benefit of a wire wanna throw a cup of water in the microwave and fire it up I'm curious are we actually oh yeah we're throwing something okay throw throw uh yeah yeah make yourself a home Tanner I get basically everything about his life right no you don't I I came all the time you told me I wouldn't game I just neglect my family in a game okay well I just thought you were better than that okay the right point is me it was awesome we can microwave endgame at the same time freaking freaking right that is pretty sick so I have a dumb question and maybe don't include this the video if it's a really stupid question who's our sponsor it would have been a great segment kind of hoped you were going there how much difference is it gonna make when I game saving 10 milliseconds it's not about the 10 milliseconds it's about the difference it's about the inconsistency and the thing you got to remember is that these are really really basic pings not that often when you're gaming the data stream is much more frequent and you might have something else going on in the background maybe you've got comms going in the background as well well that's going to screw with it so you're streaming to me you're watching a video still consistent got it whereas if I was one little jump there but that's it now we're gonna switch back over to Wi-Fi okay okay your Wi-Fi is actually lower latency what how could this possibly be more consistent okay it wasn't though this was garbage it was yeah it was bumping up to like 25. what is the point of even trying to make Tech tips well that's the thing about Wireless is that it seems to be working great and sometimes it does work great but I swear to you three hours ago this was jumping up to like 25 plus milliseconds quite frequently can confirm oh wow look at that we actually did get we gotta jump to 50 milliseconds that's what I'm talking about when that happens in a firefight that sucks you will feel that okay okay all right hold on let's put you back on I'm not done yet just like with mocha by the way you're going to want to make sure that if you're in a space where you might share power lines with someone else whether it's an apartment a duplex or even a commercial building you're going to want to set up encryption on that Network so that not just anyone can plug in a power line adapter and have it work for both standards as well there are multiple generations of the technology and while in theory they should be forwards and or backwards compatible that's not always the case so I would recommend matching adapters for the best possible results in our case this is looking pretty good why don't we load it up a little heavier uh let's get another twitch stream going sure okay who else do we like to watch uh summit1g let's go uh uh wow are we using 25 CPU watching twitch oh a lot more than that okay cool and we're using about half of your internet connection we are seeing some spikes 2027 now let's switch over to Wi-Fi [Music] and through okay but our twitch streams did this one just go down in quality too no yeah sure enough Wireless
