Here I have a hoop it's actually a bike tyre but 
you get the idea and we've taped some very heavy   ball bearings in the side here so the question 
now is if I was to roll this hoop with a point   mass substantially heavier than the mass of the 
rest of the hoop when it gets to here will it   just accelerate down or will this coming down 
under Gravity lift up the rest of the hoop and   give us a Hopping action well the first person 
to ask this question at least in writing was   our Littlewood a British mathematician at 
Cambridge who in 1953 wrote a book called A   Mathematician's Miscellany and the introduction 
basically says that Littlewood could not be   bothered coming up with some kind of theme or 
general concept to hold all the bits in the book   together I Aspire for that 
kind of uh Reckless abandon   when it comes to writing popular maths books 
however a few pages in he presents this exact   concept uh here we go a weight is attached to a 
point of a rough weightless hoop which then rolls   in a vertical plane starting near the position of 
unstable equilibrium which is to say the weight is   right at the top what happens and is it intuitive 
well I thought I thought I'd give it a go [Music] and according to Littlewood this hoop will hop 
If released to rotate and they don't do a lot   of mathematics there's like one extra paragraph 
a little bit here where they go through it but   several decades later Tadashi Tokieda who uh you 
may know from their fantastic Numberphile videos   wrote a quick uh two-page bit of mathematics 
this was in 1997 showing that yes the hoop   should hop when that mass is on its way down 
but then these people disagreed so before we   get into what several papers which I mean I'm 
not saying that mass is the best indicator for   mathematical value but a lot bigger than what was 
happening here before we go into those I thought   we'd just roll some hoops we'll see if they hop so 
we got this one which has got the weights inside a   bike tyre we also got this one here so that's some 
metal weights and we've got the Sandpaper on the   outside it's got to be a rough hoop and as you 
can see I mean if you roll it slowly like this   weird kind of lurching action we can do a lot 
better we've also got this one it's got teeth   so it digs into whatever surface it's on to stop 
it from slipping and there's a very heavy mass   uh built in there so we're going to take all 
of these out into the Hall see what happens [Music] yes the tyre has a bit of a bounce to it but don't 
worry the wooden one does hop see that's a hop [Music] foreign before we get down to hoopness I want to 
mention that this video is part of the Stand-up  Maths Mental Health Season sponsored by 
betterhelp.com that's h-e-l-p they have over 10   000 licensed therapists that you can contact to 
help you with your mental health but the point of   the Stand-up Maths Mental Health Season is not 
that you necessarily have to go to better help   there's loads of other places where you can get 
support in this video I'm going to be highlighting   the fact that if you are a university student or 
maybe you work or study somehow at a university   there may be free mental health support available 
that was one of the times I got therapy myself   when I was an undergraduate at the University of 
Western Australia they provided therapy sessions   for undergraduates I took advantage of that and 
it was super helpful so if you're at a university   do see what support they provide if you're not 
at a university you may have other access to   mental health support and of course betterhelp.com 
h-e-l-p help if you go on there you can answer a   few questions about what you have hoping to get 
out of therapy and they will match you up with a   licensed therapist anywhere in the world and you 
can start communicating with them online through   either video chat or messages thank you very much 
to betterhelp.com stand up Maths for sponsoring   this mental health season finally better help is 
not a crisis mental health support service I will   link to some of those below if you want to check 
those out and that's it now it's time to get back   to better hoop we managed to get these hoops to 
hop out in the hallway the question now is does   that count I'm not gonna lie we really had to give 
them some serious angular momentum eat them as the   kids would have said about five to ten years ago 
anyway the point is we had to move them pretty   fast to get them to actually hop and my friend 
Lisa Matha made these for me and we were actually   doing a geometric installation at a festival Last 
Summer she brought along some of the prototypes   we realized we moved them slowly they absolutely 
did not hop but if we gave them a real angular   momentaring as the kids will say from now on uh 
they did hop and we were pretty pleased with that   um until sometime later Katie's tackles who 
was there you may remember from previous   videos of mine sent me a Hopping hummus because 
an unbalanced container of hummus would indeed hop   which leads to my first conjecture are there any 
unbalanced wheel if heated fast enough will hop   the wording is not final but the point is I think 
if any kind of disc has a imbalance in the mass   there's a speed such that it will hop which is not 
the original question that Littlewood was trying   to raise to recap Littlewoods set up we've got a 
point weight here on the top of a rough which is   taken to mean uh infinite friction not going to 
slip which we've done by using the little kind of   saw teeth and we've got this non-slip mat on the 
table today so it means this is never going to   slip weightless which means all the masses here 
the technically no mass down here and it starts   near the position of unstable equilibrium and the 
position of unstable equilibrium is that one there   because technically I could balance it right there 
oh it's an equilibrium but it's so unstable like   if it's even slightly off away it goes and so the 
idea is you start with it here you gently release   it and then you allow it to roll so you know what 
we've got it all set up here let's do some slow   motion of that happening see if we can catch 
the Hop In Action starting from the standstill foreign [Music] says here the hoop lifts off the ground when the 
radius Vector to the weight becomes horizontal   which is that position there and you will have 
seen in the slo-mo that that puzzle seam was   directly down when it should have been hopping 
and they say uh the motion is equivalent to the   weight sliding smoothly under Gravity on the 
cycloid it describes pretty intuitive um and   it will sooner or later leave that huh why doesn't 
clear that up at all thank goodness Tadashi was on   the case there are two shapes we need to follow 
Tadashi's argument one of them is the cycloid   that's the shape you get if you follow a point 
on a rotating wheel so if you imagine if I start   that there you've got let's take the middle one of 
these three as I rotate it down it becomes a line   coming down like this it hits the ground and stops 
and then goes so straight back up again as such   right and this shape here this is a cycloid and 
you can carry that on and so any point on a wheel   will Trace out this kind of bouncing pattern not 
a parabola but the parabola is our second shape   so if I had an object I'm going to use this dice 
this is going to represent again just the middle   one of these masses this is a point mass if there 
was no wheel at all and this mass was moving it   would follow a parabola and that's what the shape 
would do if there was no wheel however the wheel   has no mass so we've kind of got two conflicting 
shapes here the point is technically on a wheel   so it should follow a cycloid but yet the wheel's 
got no mass so it should be following a parabola   we need to plot and compare both those shapes 
it's jojoba time so we've got a massless hoop   in blue and a point mass at p and you can see 
there's some angle Theta we're measuring that   from the vertical Direction and I can actually I 
can move Theta around manually to make the hoop   roll or I can just start animating it and there it 
is rolling as if gravity oh did it hop who knows   um we'll find out in a second so I'm going to 
reverse that back up again and so if you think   about the path that P is tracing out from before 
that's our cycloid actually I can turn that on   there it is and now as I animate the who going 
backwards and fours you can see p always stays   on that line now actually we're not going to 
see it hop in this animation because this is   not a simulation it's a diagram so it's not like 
we're numerically simulating what will happen   we're actually just animating the circle moving 
backwards and forwards so we're not going to get   any additional insight into the actual mechanics 
from what the circle does the Insight is what   happens if we turn on the parabola because you can 
imagine at any point in the rotation of this hoop   if the Hoops suddenly vanish this would continue 
moving along a parabola so actually at all points   in time there exists a parabola that this is 
on that shows the motion if it was a projectile   to be at the same place and the same velocity 
as if it's when it's rolling on the hoop so the   parabola is what would happen if the hoop suddenly 
vanished and I can turn that on here there it is   that green line is the parabola so that's like 
the Phantom Parabola if there suddenly was no   hoop the part but the particle's still there 
it would carry on along that so if I move it   backwards and forwards you can see the parabola 
changes as the hoop rolls it's very cool and the   question now is does that Parabola always stay 
inside the cycloid and if you know I'm going to   animate it through so you'll watch the parabola 
and oh did it or did it flip outside if I go a   little bit further forward look at that it's 
outside and so that means at that exact point   here the projectile path is outside the cycloid 
motion on a wheel path because if it's inside   basically means it's just pushing into the 
wheel that's not going to happen but if it's   on the outside well this is what Tadashi argues 
the moment that Parabola is outside the cycloid   it means we're going to switch from Rolling 
wheel motion to projectile motion and that   means the hoop is going to hop now we didn't see 
it because obviously this is not zero mass this   is made of wood and there's the friction we've 
tried to go for no friction but the point is our   physical model wasn't a perfect enough Recreation 
of the pure mathematics but what's mentioned first   of all by Littlewood and then done in detail 
like Dashi is that in theory the hoop should   hop nope at least according to at a minimum this 
paper hopping Hoops don't hop so this was not the   final word in 1997 we have a lot more mathematical 
Publications about the hopping hoop all of these   are from 2000 onwards I'm going to put them aside 
for now and look at these two from 1999 which are   pretty much have the same argument so I'm going 
to pick the one that actually says hopping Hoops   don't hop but we have also got the hopping hoop 
Revisited which came out like a month because   ones like July this one's no June July in 
99 there's one's from the August September   publication so the general argument here is that 
the hoop has to slip so they're saying that's all   well and good to have your argument here where the 
mass comes down and then the parabola goes outside   the cycloid and hop but they're like well hang 
on how is it going to hop like without slipping   so to hop assuming infinite friction it would have 
to go like straight up somehow but there's always   going to be some element of slipping and I'm very 
much paraphrasing some long involved mathematical   arguments but they say no if we retain Newton's 
Laws which we probably should that's kind of the   whole point here and in impenetrable flaw which 
means the hoop can't go below the surface it's   rolling on then the no slip condition must be 
violated when n equals zero so that's like when   it would hop implying that the hoop scares so 
they're saying when you get to the point here   where it should hop it can't hop that doesn't 
work like in Newtonian physics the only thing   that can happen is it has to Skid there's no 
way you're going to get a non-skidding hop   or so they say I will say there's one final 
conclusion this paper that I absolutely love   at the very end they've got a final theorem the 
behavior of hopping Hoops is not intuitive which   is what Littlewood originally raised and uh they 
they state that as a theorem and their proof is   by inspection if there's anything we can agree on 
so far it's that final three bits of mathematical   research that came out between the year 2000 
and 2009 and this is when people start to take   the physics a bit more seriously and they're 
like look instead of assuming that the hoop   is massless that's ridiculous let's look at the 
ratio of masses so the hoop has got some mass   and there's some ratio which they used a gamma to 
represent that's here is the point mass so that's   just an unbalanced hoop instead of having infinite 
friction let's just have a coefficient of friction   what's wrong with mu bring mu back in again so now 
they were able to Model A unbalanced rolling on a   surface with some friction and it turns out first 
of all if we put hopping aside for a moment which   I know will make some people hopping, hopping mad 
little joke there for all the joke fans for the   maths fans however there are actually three things 
a hoop can do when it's rolling you've got the   actual rolling action that's kind of the default 
Behavior you've also got slipping so if there's   not enough friction you might get a slipping 
effect where it rotates this way and interestingly   the friction force is acting in that direction if 
it's slipping this way you've also got skidding   now that's different to slipping skidding is like 
the comedy coming to a halt that's the effect in   which case now the friction goes that way so 
slipping and skidding are distinguished by the   different directions that the friction is acting 
and are in a more realistic Universe where we do   have some non-infinite friction it turns out both 
those things can happen when you release a hoop   with different amounts of initial angular momentum 
but we've got a lot of variables now we're going   to need some diagrams some phase diagrams phase 
diagrams so each one of these individual plots   is for a specific combination of mass ratio and 
coefficient of friction in fact the top four all   have the same mass ratio where three quarters of 
the entire system mass is in the point mass and   then they gradually ease up on the coefficient of 
friction and then on the vertical axis we have the   amount of initial angular velocity so you pick a 
point on the vertical axis for how fast you want   to start this thing going and as you move across 
horizontally that's the rotation Theta as it's   rotating and it tells you what happens if it's 
hashed it means that it's rolling normally if   it hits a d region that means it's skidding if it 
hits an S region that means it's slipping and so   if you look at this you can pick your starting 
point for whatever combination of the physical   setup you want and then you move across and 
you're like oh it's rolling and now it's   slipping or skidding or doing whatever and then 
eventually something interesting might happen it   might repeat so if it gets to the far side with no 
blank spaces it means nothing interesting happened   if it hits a z that's the zero line that means it 
grounds to a halt and if it hits an H that means   it hops there you are those are the Hop regions 
and as you may have noticed they're all the top   which means High initial angular velocity 
which means if you eat something it shall hop   still working on the wording now I just need to 
bring this video gently rolling to a satisfying   conclusion and I will say that this kind of 
exploration of the actual physics is super   interesting at the very end they've got a table 
of all the different combinations of things the   hoop can do like you can see here it can roll and 
then slide and then roll and then skid and then   roll again and then slide then roll then skid 
then right it's so interesting all this going   on and I'm not the first person to like make 
hoops and see what happens uh Tadashi way back   here did that they say at the very bottom here 
um we taped a battery on the hula hoop I mean   that's pretty much what we've done here I'll be 
honest and rolled it along the 12th floor hallway   in fine Hall that's at Princeton and says uh it 
actually hopped I suspect that's a case of just   you know the Yeet situation and then over here in 
one of these papers they've got a fantastic there   is at the back there's a shot they got a hoop 
they put a mass on it they rolled it and they   showed once again if you give it a bit of speed it 
will hop and the very last paper from 2009 this is   pretty cool they got a hoop actually not this 
similar where's mine this kind of a setup and   they put LEDs on it so they could more closely 
track what was going on and they released on a   variety of different slopes because the increase 
in slope meant that you'd have that extra speeding   up which would cause it to hop and they found 
that sometimes for very severe slopes it would   hop on the first rotation and for there's like 
a range of middle slopes where it wouldn't hop   the first time the masses like the point mass 
came down but it would hop on the second one   um very cool and actually this validated a lot 
of the kind of the physics papers that came out   between 2000 and 2009 and it dissed these from the 
conclusion here they say first of all our results   support the predictions made in reference five and 
their reference five is the 2000 paper so this was   theoretical maths they then did the experiment 
and showed that it all lines up very good however   they do say the experimental confirmation that the 
hoop Hops at and then a range of angles supports   equation 11 and contradicts reference three that's 
uh this one the hopping hoop Revisited so this   physics they're like No Deal what a what a what a 
maths smackdown those are some harsh words look at   that contradicts reference three please language 
from the conclusion of this paper they also say   that the 99 Theory doesn't work and they say that 
what Tadashi Tokieda and Littlewood were saying   doesn't work either so uh from here therefore 
and this is the situation for the massless who   like originally set up by Littlewood therefore 
the hoop will hop as suggested by Littlewood and   Tokieda only if there is a discontinuous 
increase in the angular acceleration   which is a fancy way of saying it doesn't work 
in terms of like physics as we understand it they   actually introduce A New Concept called skimming 
which is where the mass has switched from the   cycloid to the parabola but the hoop is now kind 
of levitating along it's skimming not skidding   it's skimming along with it so it doesn't 
actually hop so I mean the grand conclusion is   I don't know they are we don't know someone else 
wants to make a bigger better hoop let me know or   some more maths occurs let me know or I've missed 
something please do let me know but uh I mean the   Yeet Theory is correct these papers do prove if 
you've got an unbalanced uh wheel and you move   it fast enough it will hop and to Littlewoods 
credit back in 1953 they did originally put the   very last line in their setup in actual practice 
the hoop skids first so even Littlewood from the   very beginning knew that you probably wouldn't 
actually see this with a hoop because in reality   it's gonna skid so uh although we since renamed 
that slipping ah what are you gonna do uh point   is we had a lot of fun building the hoop so huge
