- We created the largest
game of dodge ball, ever. We got hundreds of people,
hundreds of dodge balls, and plenty of referees to
make sure it went smoothly. We're about to break the world record for the largest game of dodge ball. We have red team over here. And we have a blue team over here. We have hundreds of people on each side. Our red team and blue team, and we're gonna see which one wins. They don't know this, but the winning team gets a lot of money. Look at all these people over here, and all these people over here. It's like a freakin' army. Which team do we wanna be on? I think we should all work together. - Blue.
- Blue it is. - Blue it is.
- All right. - This is gonna be nuts. - Three, two, one, go. The dodge ball game's currently underway, I'm gonna go intermingle. Let's go see what they're up to. How's it going? How's it going?
- My shoe came off. - Your shoe? - Yeah, I put it back on though. - Oh, okay. Do something for the camera. Let's see it, man. Oh, nope. Is this your tactic? Just the dance? - Yeah, I mean, if you dance,
they can't see you, you know? Just plain logic. - All right, let's see. I'll see if you're here at the end. You guys are just hiding at the back? - Yeah, he can't stop. - Go up front, man. Go up front, don't be a baby. You go join him.
- What? - Go, go. Things are getting pretty crazy. I'm gonna go get an aerial view. Yeah, blue is definitely winning. I'm gonna go encourage red. You just hiding in the back? - Yeah. - Cool.
- Behind the tall people. - We'll see how long that works, man. Hey, Chandler!
- Yo. - Come with me, come with me. World's largest game of dodge ball, let's just run through the middle. Whoa, what's going on? - Oh, hit him. Oh, my nuts. Here, run with me. Oh, we didn't even get hit. Let's just go for a stroll. - We have the power. - Oh wait, are those chicken nuggets? - Focus. - Can we eat 'em? - I don't know who's
chicken nuggets those are. - What if it's a little kids? - Don't eat the chicken nuggets. - We might have the world's
largest game of dodge ball going on, but those chicken
nuggets look pretty scrumptious. Are those y'all's chicken nuggets? - Gifts, gifts, gifts, gifts. - Come on, let's go, let's go, come on. - Let's go, Chandler. - You got it, you got it, come on. Oh, man. - Watch out! - Oh, you okay? - Oh! - Oh, you're out. - Thanks for hosting. - Yeah, no problem. - I'm already out.
- Oh, you are? - Well, that means you should be out. - Right in the middle of the game. - Bye, man. - How's the red team doing? - Y'all we getting- - We're getting killed, we're getting- - We getting murdered out here, bruh. - Oh, good throw. - What happened?
- Hit right in the leg, man. - Oh, that sucks.
- I know, right? - I took myself out of the game, because I wanted the blue
team to have a chance. Because the red team brings the pain. Mr. Beast, if you see this, you know that I was ready,
and I brought the pain. - My shoe came untied. So intense, man. - What's the strategy to win this one? Just lob it up, somebody
gonna get hit, right? - There you go. Oh, in there! Oh you got him out, you got him out! - Man, we are winning right now. - Oh! This is chaos. - All right, I'm joining your team. - Just hit me in the face. - Are you okay, Chris? - I'm not. - You good?
- I'm dying. Ah. I got out. I'm going, I'm leaving. - Chandler. - We can't even win a team
dodge ball tournament. - You're out bro.
- I'm in the front lines, man. I got hit by four times. Yeah, I'm on the red team now. - So your team looks like they're winning, 'cause I just went- - How did Chandler get over there? - Chandler lost. So he just decided to join
the team that got him out. - Wait, do you think our numbers are low? - Their numbers are low. - We're winning apparently. - Chris really tried to hit me. - Oh! - Yes! Get out Chan! Woo! Woo! - Uh oh, look at Chris here. - I'm sneaky. - Ty, dance. Ty, dance. That's really all you have? Come on. What was that? - Chill, chill.
- Come on. - Nice strike. - I think the blue team's doing a tactic where they save up balls in a barrage. They're about to return fire. They appear to be using medieval warfare, and using the barrage tactic. - That's a good tactic for this. - Red team, oh my goodness. I don't know how much more blue can take. So we're taking a two second
break to move the zones in again, and then we'll
continue the warfare. How's the game looking? - I think blue team's really
got some power behind it. - Oh, I'm going into ref
because we got some cheaters. I'm about to take 'em
out, they have a bullhorn. You're out. - They're outnumbering you right now. - Who, who, who worried about?
- What's the deal? Chandler, how's it looking? - I don't know, man. I keep getting hit. - Hey whoa, whoa, whoa. Foot on the line. - Buddy, what are we doing? Why are we out here? - Oh, my God. You almost died. Ah! - I got double hit. - We need a medic. Are you okay, sir?
- No. - Are you choking?
- Yes. - You're choking. - Chandler, there's only
one thing we can do. - Drag him in the middle. - Everybody hit Chris. No, no, hit Chris! - No! No, ah! Why would you tell them that? - Oh, my God, Chris. - He's gonna hate me. - Why would you tell 'em that? - Speaking of beating Chris, he has a surprise birthday party tonight. I'll vlog a little bit of
that at the end of the video, but we're surprising him for- He's coming, shh. - Wait, Chris, how old are you now? - 23. - And your birthday
was just passed, right? - July 1st. - It only makes sense, you get pelted 23 times. - No. - He has no idea. So watch till the end. Can I throw that ball? What's your secret? You're killing it, dude. Oh, what was that move? Was that the slap of death? How's it going? Just dodging dodge balls? - Yep. - You kind of need to get someone out, your team's not looking too solid. Here's another try, I'd try again. Oh, heads up. Good job. - Bye, bye. Bye, bye. - I just got out, I feel
like Chandler right now. - Are you hiding behind them? - Yes. - All right, let's get Chandler out. Let's get Chandler out.
- Who's Chandler? - Get him. - Comment down below who you
think's gonna win, y'all. - I'm on YouTube! I could be a meme now! - All right, guys. Red's in the slumps. I think it's time we all
go in and join red team. - All right. - Joining red team almost
all the way through the game on three, one, two, three, . - What were we saying? - Jake, you're the blocker. - I like this guy. Our strategy is to keep him alive. - We will die for you, man. - That's all you.
- No pressure. - No pressure.
- You got this. - So what's the game plan here? - Dodge, duck, dip and dodge. - Man, just stay behind us, we got you. - Somehow they got Chris, Garret, Chandler, and Jimmy? - I can't get out. You can't even get me. - I forgot you were behind me.
- He lost. - I forgot you were behind me. - Your job was to be a shield. - You're out! - Since he got out, there's no reds left. We weren't technically red. - Guys, celebrate with the blue team. - No. - Celebrate with the blue team. - No. What a bunch of losers. - Well they won, so. - Yeah, actually they're winners. - I did it.
- We did it, we did it. - You were on red team. - There you guys have it, that was the world's largest
game of dodge ball, I think. I don't know, I'm kind of
just making up as we go. And we brought a bunch of money, and we're just gonna split it up between all the people that won. I don't really know how much it is. Yeah everyone on blue
team's gonna get some money. It looks like they're about
to riot in the streets. I'll keep you updated on that. Now we're gonna go to
Chris's birthday party. So we're here at Sup Dogs. Chris is gonna arrive in like 20 minutes for his surprise birthday party. - Yes, sir.
- Let's get it. - We got Garret. Garret's brother. We got Caroline. Hi, Caroline. We got everyone Chris knows. We're waiting for you. You're the man of the hour. - We should've said happy birthday. - Happy birthday. - No, man. - Were you extra surprised? - I was extra- - Everyone you love, are they all here?
