you guys are not going to believe we just got the RTX 5090 and I'm about to risk it up to unbox this product that looks really interesting and I wait a second where am I oh oh I know this is the new set for game linked this looks amazing we're doing a gaming News Channel guys we've got all these lights and we got the big G and this is huge we afford all of this a lot more easily than you would think in fact this entire setup is so cheap that I'm starting to wonder if I even need a big Studio like this that I'm not even standing in front of now these days anyone can key out a background with pretty good results but the key night among you might have noticed something that is more than just pretty good how on Earth did we manage to move the camera around inside of our new set follow me and I'll show you the tech is just on the other side of this tunnel let's go oh look at all the pretty Segways to our sponsor hetzner Hester is now offering brand new arm 64 Cloud servers you can discover ampere's efficient and robust arm64 architecture and be ready to be blown away by its performance deploy yours now by clicking the link down below we're finally launching our new gaming News Channel game linked but we have two big problems to solve the first is space to give the channel a clear identity we wanted it to have its own set but look around we don't have space for another large set like we built for TechLink I mean we could just use the green screen that we already have but that leads to our second issue time we want to solve a long-standing problem minus Line stop it's tackling time for Tech linked what is this doing here where we can't shoot anything there while they're shooting there and we can't shoot anything here while they're shooting there it's infuriating all right just cut brake protect linked this is the kind of thing that wastes a ton of production time around here and the issues compounded by the fact that adding green screens creates a lot of extra work for our editors our Tech news show techlinked is produced entirely in a single day and the current workflow often requires the team to work into the evening to get it out on time the solution moving our green screen over here or well more accurately adding a second green screen now Tech linked and game linked never have to wait for our other videos or vice versa and we get to maintain Clear Channel identities without acquiring more expensive Vancouver real estate nice except for one small problem quality green screen work is still more complex than simply taking out the green and putting in the other stuff you can end up with all sorts of wonky artifacts that will make your composite look like crap for example any green in your clothing can end up being keyed out like this news Anchor's dress or you can have color spilled from the reflected green light on the set that makes your subject look anemic blocky cutouts can eliminate fine details like FlyAway hairs and you can end up with weird unnatural blur as the key struggles to compensate for the motion blur on a moving subject and of course if there are any Shadows on the set then the color filter might not be able to select the key and that's just the basic problems all of these need to be fixed after the fact by a video editor meaning that any time we gained from shooting simultaneously gets thrown out the window later on in the production pipeline is what I used to say see here's the thing big TV stations and production houses have had tools like this one for whoa God that's on Wheels cool as I was saying big TV stations and production houses have had tools like this for decades but it's only recently that boxes like this one have gotten affordable meet the Blackmagic ultimat 4K this little Wonder costs less than an apple Vision Pro headset and allows us to live composite our video footage which takes all of the extra post-production work out of the process how well let me tell you actually let me show you because I think that's going to be an easier way of understanding as we explore the software and give you some examples hi Ed cool one moment please this looks so mind-blowingly good look at these little hairs there's no green around them if I wasn't looking at this right now I would have no idea that okay how does this work okay how is it doing this no for real though screen it takes out the grain yes I know it takes out the green but the the the reflections internally on that thing whatever Hardware accelerated trickery they're using the base concept is like any other green screen so we look at the raw input coming out of the camera we select a color value that we want to remove or key out and then using the power of compositing we put our lovely host into a virtual set that's kind of the easy part these days I mean even your smartphone can make fake backgrounds for tick tock filters the cool part is remember all those issues I mentioned before like color spill and sloppy cutouts we can resolve them right on device before it ever gets recorded can you show me raw because this looks pretty good right now all right so let's start from the beginning we will capture Andy hold on don't move there's a lot of green or like uh like noise why is that because those parts so the green screen are not perfectly lit and don't quite match our Green Valley it's either hotter than the rest of the green screen or darker okay that's bad yeah I mean that's bad it's uh you're gonna run into that without uh spending a ton of time and money with more lights every time I'm always on about the budget now we've got this noise but using a setting called Veil we can just tell it see y'all later buddy yeah and this is essentially in a normal green screen process you were saying it's like black clipping or white clipping yeah it's essentially crushing the lights or blacks so that there's no in between the fuzz that you were seeing were gray so we don't want this gray we want a clean all black on Andy all white on the green screen yeah so if I turn off the veil settings here you can see that you got in and out of uh gray there the tricky part about chroma keying and this has existed forever is that it's a balance of taking things away but also keeping the things that you want in there right and when you adjust something like Veil it's flipping the lights are blacks when something is in the gray here naturally like hair that can get lost yeah okay but we can fix that yes good I mean like right now it's looking pretty good we have some Buzz because we've taken a bit too much your hair is the worst to handle for this so what I'm looking for is different angles to see if there aren't any issues uh cropping up especially on the edges of his head where the hair you know likes to be wispy and stick out they're very likely to get cut out and look just blocky that's actually really good yeah I'm convinced what else do we need to adjust realistically with what this is looking like right now we don't have to change anything yeah play around with some stuff to change though we want to show off the software one thing we can adjust here because our screen is actually not perfect it's wrinkly and it's not perfectly lit in the corners you can see that here showing up yeah and we would use Shadow threshold to get rid of that what that's doing is oh up Shadow compensation it's very similar to Veil it's just setting a point where anything that's Brighter Than This the white but if we were to overdo that could we end up with um you know a reflection off of of Andy's skin turning background color too much and it turns like that yeah that's really yucky yeah let's bring back 30s Andy there's a vast number of other parameters that we can adjust here depending on the complexity of our production you can see Ed's doing a little bit of skin tone correction a little bit of color correction it can do that in Hardware it can also handle spill correction so if Andy was standing on a green floor as well he'd obviously have a lot more green light reflecting on him we can compensate for that it can even add his shadow back in so it can find where his shadow would be from the studio Lighting on the green floor key out the green floor but leave that shadow in place on the final composite now once the settings are dialed in what's great about this is we can just shoot and send the composite off to the editor who edits it as if it wasn't shot on a green screen in the first place that is super cool and could save us a ton of time like even with with lighting changes it should work pretty well because it has a feature where it captures just the background so that anything that isn't the background you know gets left in you might think hey and what's the point I'm chroma keying I'm not sure because they don't really explain that okay so what's happening now so what's happening is it took that capture right yeah and is saying okay this is the green screen so anything not this is supposed to be keyed out you basically get a plate of your green screen and tell it hey that's what it's supposed to look like yeah that is amazing using the green screen capture and then using a difference mode right yeah and go on okay so this is the difference don't wow don't cute so if you're on a static background actually your background could be just about anything I mean can we try it can you just turn that camera a few degrees to me does it need to be locked off okay yeah so just turn it over here oh my goodness okay so then yeah I'll move and then do the thing and then I go back in okay that does not work very well the other like it works better than I thought it would but that doesn't explain how we moved around inside of our virtual set earlier this is super cool instead of building a set and then shooting a plate or a static 2D shot to put our host in front of the game link set was designed in Unreal Engine meaning that like in a video game you can render it from any angle simply by moving your virtual camera the big trick then is to match the movement of the virtual camera to the real one now in the past this required meticulous planning and choreography between the film Crews and the post-production teams but recent advancements allow us to track our camera motion and then export that 3D movement data directly into Unreal Engine the baller way to do this is with a giant high resolution video wall like on the Mandalorian but ain't nobody got money for that fortunately virtual production has blown up into a massive market and the leftover Chum from the sharks at the top starting to trickle down to us little deep sea Guppies instead of requiring a massive high resolution screen we can use their Unreal Engine tricks to make a high-tech set that can pack away into an LTT backpack but how do we get the camera movement from The Real World translated into our virtual world did you spot these QR code looking things earlier they're alignment markers to make a convincing composite it's imperative that you match the camera's movement with the backdrop perfectly and to do that you have to establish an exact starting position then from there there are a number of different ways to track the physical camera's movement from that starting position the ideal solution would be to make use of five Mars trackers these are essentially the third generation Vive body trackers that folks have been using for full body tracking and applications like VR chat what makes these ones special is that they hook up to a special transmitter that sends data to a monitor and allows you to sync time code with your camera so that your motion data and your shots are temporally and physically aligned the downside is the kit costs five thousand dollars fortunately there are cheaper Solutions in fact you might even be holding one in your hand right now Apple's AR kit allows us to use the Myriad sensors on the iPhone to lamb or simultaneous localization and mapping in a nutshell by attaching this to our camera rig we can collect accurate motion data for our camera if you're an Android User you may also be able to take advantage of AR core but we can't speak to how well that works we ended up using an iPhone now that we have our tracking data we can export that and import it into Unreal Engine as movement for our virtual camera to really sell the illusion you also need to match all of your camera settings so your focal length your lens size Etc you line up the movement with your set and then you end up with what we showed off in our intro not gonna lie while this 3D camera position matching can be done in real time we set out to build a workflow for a bi-weekly YouTube news show so everything you're seeing now was done in post but we just wanted to show off what could be done on a budget of a sheet of green cloth an iPhone and a computer but even though we'll be sticking with a static camera for game length at least for now I'm sure we're going to find some opportunity opportunities to use these new capabilities and who knows maybe you will too like how cool would it be if we wanted to film at Sunrise whenever we wanted to oh speaking of widgets day that it is which means game length will be posted soon quick go subscribe to the new channel everyone's going to be there like James and Riley and rush and me and our sponsor ground news as an LTT viewer you probably know about the effect that algorithms have on what you see online outrage gets clicks and it can crowd out the information that actually matters like where's the coverage of Linus's social post about which smart home company is screwing them over currently this is bull spit enter ground news their app and website gather thousands of sources from across the political spectrum and the globe in one place so you can compare coverage it's real simple here's a story about the Reddit CEO's response to mods leading a blackout to protest API changes the story was covered by just 12 sources and most of them lean left with absolutely no coverage on the right it's interesting to see how different Outlets frame the same issue by simply comparing the headlines it's also great at finding International perspectives and stories that media outlets in the US don't give as much coverage to you can use their map feature to see the major events taking place around the globe ground news is a really cool platform that puts you in the driver's seat instead of an algorithm so you
