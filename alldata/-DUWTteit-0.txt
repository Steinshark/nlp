portable gaming systems like the valve steam deck offer an unprecedented amount of pc gaming goodness in a handheld form factor but with great performance comes great heat and great fan noise now valve has addressed this to a significant degree pun intended by altering the fan curves of the steam deck to achieve a better balance between noise and thermal management but there's a limit to how much you can do by simply tuning how quickly your fan is spinning the laws of physics can't be broken well you know what i say i say physics we're gonna do it hot rod style with this m.2 cooler this block of aluminum about a hundred thousand dollars worth of solid works licenses and of course this is this is it this is all we've got well we also have a tormach like a pretty big shop we're gonna have some fun fun telling you about our sponsor pdq take patch management off your plate by automating it with pdq you can keep your machines patched and up-to-date automatically giving you time to do more important things like watching linus tech tips start your free trial at pdq.com linus [Music] the genesis of this video was actually a conversation with aya about the upcoming neo2 because it's much smaller more compact than the steam deck but it actually has a similar thermal envelope for the soc and i expressed concern knowing what i knew about the okay better managed but certainly audible fan on the steam deck that if you got to remove that heat you got to do it somehow and i was like dude you know would be super cool if you just had like a strap-on cooler remember those you know those little water coolers that you can just dunk ice into a reservoir and then lube onto the back of your phone oh yeah well apparently enough people are buying those that it's an entire freaking product category so it really doesn't seem that far-fetched to have a strap-on extra cooling module for your handheld gaming pc and i think that with alex's skills we could actually do it in a way that is pretty darn user friendly so today i'm making your strap-on yes yes let's do it the idea then is to repurpose another cooler like this hr09 m.2 cooler from thermal right to add supplemental cooling to the soc and we believe the steam deck is a perfect candidate for this because with relative ease we can jury rig a mounting mechanism and cut a hole in the back of it that'll let it just kind of hot rod out the back should be easy of course to determine whether our modification achieves the desired results we're going to need to take some baseline readings now we can't rely on performance for this because i think alex and i are in agreement that it will probably be identical after the fact yeah these systems are generally power limited more so than they are thermally limited but what we can see is in a demanding game like horizon zero dawn our cpu and gpu are sitting in the 82 to 84 degree range and our system fan is noticeably audible those are two things we'd like to address also alex our fan rpm is around 5700 oh that's pretty high yeah i'll be really interested to see if we can lower that that's a way that we can empirically measure how much quieter we've made it even though we don't have an acoustic chamber yet yeah the tormach being on is louder than this but like it's a cnc mill if i was sitting gaming i would definitely notice this yeah step one then shut down the steam deck yep take it apart perhaps for the last time well it's gonna survive this this can be fine you know how mad people are gonna be if we ruin a steam deck these things are rarer than hens teeth it'll be fine this explicitly says no thermal testing that's only because we've disassembled it before it's fine to thermally test this against itself with a different cooler on it just want to point that out what a nerd dan signed the inside of this one from when he opened it up to fix it also really dan or is this from you well that's from me but it came with not all the screws in it from dan what's next then this is about the shape that i'm thinking our thing will be it kind of interferes with our wifi card that might be a problem which thing oh you're gonna do a big heat spreader well we need this to attach to something that can attach to the mounting holes got it so we need a like a mid plate yeah understood hey i couldn't help noticing this emi shield also seems to be acting as a heat spreader of some sort for the vrms have we accounted for that oh yeah we're just gonna cover this thing in thermal pads instead of those thermal pads you know we could use say it i don't want no we could just coat this entire thing in k5 pro we are not doing that you know how long it took me to clean that graphics card but think about how great for one our thermals would be and two it would be so easy to put on and also uh so easy to put on okay yeah enough oh i learned this really cool tip recently if you want the center to center distance between two holes that are the same size come in measure the one hole zero it and then you can measure to the outside of each hole oh that's cool and then it's just subtracted yeah essentially it cancels out so we have 1.9 cool you turn on the fume extractor yeah just for sanity we're going to laser cut out a little thing here make sure everything lines up doesn't interfere now we can check around the middle if it looks good nice ah brandon be fast you'll miss it he fight he's firing my laser good job alex a lot of people might have used scissors to cut paper if you use scissors to cut paper like what are you even doing some kind of caveman what yeah what's the repeatability of your scissor cutting my laser is under a thou so maybe i want to scooch it that way just a tiny bit more but that seems pretty good yeah that seems freaking awesome i mean honestly i don't even think you need to we might as well it's just cheap insurance it's very easy good we're good we're good to go we're ready to go i'm moving we're ready 0.03 of an inch we're ready give me the aluminum i'm cutting it okay i need your help you don't even put that piece of aluminum in there you need to cut it first okay what do i do then uh you can cut a hole in the back of this can we just laser that no this is i believe abs it's a thermoplastic so instead of you know cutting it just melts and then catches on fire and it's a pretty bad time routing it we could but then i have to program the router and we have to strap this down whereas like handing you a dremel takes very little time but the results alex think of the results oh we have a template how are we going to figure out exactly where the temperature is gonna be kind of hard uh one way we can do it is this hole right here lines up with that so it does it'll be close yeah it'll be like pretty close okay i can handle that oh and we also have these beautiful new bits come over here oh really you know we have this dremel screw that thing dremel stuff look what since when do dremel suck i thought we love dremels wait what are these what's this how much did i pay for this oh like 90 bucks huh they're kind of beautiful i know oh okay what do they do well it's like that sound you can use it with the dye grinder it's like a dremel but with balls huh where would i find two skinny sticks or skinny rods dowel pin assortment alloy steel uh yeah this could work yeah this will do now this is in place ish to turn this piece of aluminum into you know a functional part we need to cut it on the tormach first thing though i need to do a bunch of can if everything goes well it should look something like this that should take us about 11 minutes fun thing while you were figuring out if we can i actually ran a little experiment to determine if we should check this out uh are your plugs in yet no okay keep them out watch this okay see the gpu temps yeah around 80 uh 70 right now but yeah okay okay listen to the fan watch this i'm gonna take this heat pipe and touch it to this thermal pad oh wow it's totally gonna work it just completely dropped yeah it's already 10 degrees cooler oh my god this is like actually worth doing i just assumed it wouldn't be honestly this is gonna be freaking awesome how much more exciting is this project now that we know it's gonna totally kick ass it's honestly a lot more exciting i thought it was gonna be just stupid this guy always doubts me that's not hot no oh okay cool now it appears that i'm lining this up by hand but i'm actually not i have marked this one and then what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna put little scratch marks on for these other two i'm gonna drill out these holes then i can validate that they're all in the right spots before i make the complete cutout because i'm actually going to cut out this entire shape all right no turning back now there's officially extra holes in this steam deck now we just take this pop it back on here and see if we manage to line up all those holes what would you say if i told you i absolutely freaking nailed this i'll be burning fast holy crap did i have this on oh wait no no it's fine i only have the backing over there sorry i just brain part brain part moment now that i know where the holes are supposed to be ah i can know exactly where my template needs to be and i can mark it and cut it out oh this thing's such a beautiful machine just it's biggest out to tormach once again that is really cool oh yeah it's so sick [Music] all right [Music] looks good just need to flip her over chop off the bottom and ready to test fit if this works oh it works perfectly good but it just barely hits our wi-fi module it's like 30 seconds on the belt sander too yeah very easy the more difficult thing though you might notice our studs aren't quite long enough oh there's two ways we can go about this we can either remove a bit of material from here like a five hundredth of an inch or so or we have little chummies so we could just chop these at a good height put that on top and have the whole thing just be higher oh i think we should just shave this down yeah i think so yeah let's let's do that man we've got a we've got a lot of thickness here i think we should take this down to like half of the overall thickness okay that's my vibe just make it lower profile because that's going to take weight off of it too which would be nice and also if we take it off from the bottom here we might get a tiny bit better performance for your pizza yeah then i in the meantime i'm gonna finally actually cut out the back of this steam deck one thing that's awesome about the tormach is that we get conversational programming so instead of taking all the time to make something in solidworks program it export the g-code you can just do it right in here and tell it like i want to face something off uh 500 thousands of an inch and boom it does it i'm sorry alex i don't like the clamp you only live once uh hey alex yeah you would use those deburring things at this stage now then right at that stage you're so close i'd probably just use a file oh all right [Music] okay this voided out dremel is amazing i'm deburring slash taking off a little bit of material that i missed before just listen to it [Music] here it is my perfect dremel job you ready well okay perfect is a strong word but here it is good though here it is my not bad dermal job yeah not bad at all hi there [Music] it should fit now if we both executed perfectly this will fit immediately yep what are the odds high very high i believe in us i'm sorry are you are you taking the piss do you think that you did a good job yes well this is definitely a good job it'll fit then all right sure uh oh i go first right yep okay there it is and um yeah okay hold on very close very close hold on maybe it just needs a little massaging just a little little misogynation misogyny wait no not that it's very tight whoa damn okay that's actually pretty good yeah this is awesome thermal pads and tested i think so this is just like a black acrylic cover yep cool uh these rods are still not long enough though if we want to put our trim piece on also no but we have to take the heatsink off right because there's going to be you know a tower attached to it got it okay here we go since we don't know the exact z heights of anything in here we're taking a bit of a yolo approach we're gonna just err on the side of making our thermal pads a bit taller and then we're gonna make sure that we mash down the cooler really well one way we can validate the thickness of our thermal pads is by putting this down with just a trace amount of thermal paste on the top there and seeing if it touches it it does not so clearly this is too thick let's pull that off let's go ahead and try it one more time let's see if it's yours that's the problem yes it touched barely to make sure that we have thermal pads everywhere we need them we can look at this little shield right here and we can see this one thermal pad we're not able to hit with our plate here it's for this little ic which is probably responsible for charging and potentially gets really hot i have just the thing knew it a little tiny heatsink he's so cute look at him he's adorable then let's do a quick scan around at our thermal pads actually it looks like everything is making contact this is not terrible yeah all right freaking rock on is this the part where we screw it on yeah we'll make that one face first but yeah get the close-up out oops oh my god alex what the hell is going on man well i didn't mean to put that much on there kind of just happened we'll need to scrape some off oh my goodness i mean we do want to go a little bit heavier than we normally would any extras just going to squeeze out anyway and we're really not sure how great our contact here is going to be but that yeah you know i didn't even take off that much actually should we fire it up well let's put it back together oh wow we never actually turned it off the game is um still running oh wow okay well this is interesting oh it's running at 42 degrees holy crap yeah we just put a big cold thermal mass on it but still i wonder if just adding this sink and then a vent hole is enough maybe no it'll heat up it'll heat up it'll heat up but like if we wanted to do this not dumb we probably could just add a bunch of little fins here yeah it would passively dissipate a bunch of heat a lot more than you'd probably think might as well just leave it running i guess i mean you want big boy or small boy i want to go practical believe it or not i know who am i right let's go for the small one i'ma let you finish but there's a couple things going on here that you should know one is that this is flipping hot thermal transfer definitely taking place oh my god two is we already dropped 10 degrees it's at 71 on the gpu 72 and it has settled in we don't even need the fins on the back that's all valve had to do stick a burning hot hunk of metal on the back of the steam deck it would make it uncompliant though oh it would burn the users yeah yeah uh oh alex yeah how's this gonna stay well we're going to use this test it and i'll put back on thermal epoxy later but we need to finish this video okay cool oh my god please tell me it fits alex wait does this one not fit please tell me it fits this one fits are you sure did you fly too close to the sun i fit it earlier thermal expansion alex oh that could be it actually we have to cool it down that's cooler oh it's still pretty hot i don't know man almost and the more this goes in there the more it'll cool down faster those tolerances while it heats up here let's just appreciate the finished handiwork alex full credit man this looks awesome that is hot rod pc cooling if i have ever seen it can we take a moment to appreciate that thermal thermalright went and put a flame silhouette on this heatsink it's beautiful match made in absolute heaven right here now do you mind pulling up the the numbers from the before numbers sure i believe it was 86 degrees when we were in here man it takes a long time to get up to temps now that's why you use usbc we actually made it up to exactly the same temps 81 well not quite 81 degrees celsius yeah we're about five degrees cooler now but we did manage to drop almost 2000 rpm off the fan and it's a 2000 rpm that counts for a lot it is way quieter where do you see that down here 5300 rpm yeah it was 57 before oh i thought it was 7000. no wait it didn't work you know what i bet it is this thing is flipping hot v2 this with a fan yeah i bet we could even do that now let's mock it up i'll be back with an octo 40 mil in addition to adding a fan there's probably things we could do to more efficiently pull heat off of the soc like right now we're just thermal paste just like gooped in there and stuff like that it's not ideal wow that's really in there good though oh man that's freaking hot no way i don't know if it's gonna get higher like it might but it turns out that putting a fan on your cooler uh it works people do it for a reason yeah you don't necessarily want like you know all of this to control your fan no but i think you could probably wire a fan into the board of the steam deck it's got to have five volts somewhere yeah this is a five volt fan it would be a super easy put it in solder it would be fine what i worry is that it might cost you some of your overall power budget for the device .035 watts that's a full bore okay it's probably fine yeah this is incredible and without a doubt this would be my preferred steam deck if given the choice well and with the fan actually wired up internally yeah of course in our perfect world the mounting system for the external cooler would be such that you can unscrew it with thumbscrews or something like that pop it off and then put your normal plate on and have the whole system operate completely normally it's just that alex noticed while we were off camera that there was a bit of a gap between our m.2 cooler and the bottom plate and he vice gripped them together and now they do not come apart yeah it's not coming apart ever again no oh that's an interesting idea yeah one of the other side effects of putting the fan on is that this plate is a way more reasonable temperature now what are we looking at looks like 49 degrees yeah which is right around you get burned but it takes a real long time whereas before it was you get burned but very fast do you know who never burns you though our sponsor manscaped manscape's ultra premium collection is an
