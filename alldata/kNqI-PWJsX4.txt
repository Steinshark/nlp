see you're a curious lover of science what do you think of the efforts that Elon Musk is doing with space exploration with electric vehicles with autopilot sort of getting into the space of autonomous vehicles was boring under la and neural link trying to communicate brain machine interfaces communicate between machines and human brains what's really inspiring I mean look at the fandom that he's amassed it's it's not common for someone like that to have such a following and zilean you're a nerd yeah so it's really it's really exciting but I also think that a lot of responsibility comes with that kind of power so like if I met him I would love to hear how he feels about the responsibility he has when when there are people who are such a fan of your ideas and your dreams and share them so closely with you you have a lot of power and he didn't always have that you know he wasn't born as Elon Musk well he was but well he was named that later but the point is that that that I want to know the psychology of becoming a figure like him well I don't even know how to phrase the question right but it's a question about what do you do when you were you're following your fans become so you know large that it's almost bigger than you and how do you how do you responsibly manage that and maybe it doesn't worry him at all and that's fine too but I'd be really curious and I think there are a lot of people that go through this when they realize whoa there are a lot of eyes on me there are a lot of people who really take what I say very earnestly and take it to heart and will defend me and who that's that's some that that can be dangerous and and you have to be responsible with it both in terms of impact in society and psychologically for the individual just just the the burden psychologically and on the on yeah yeah how does he how does he think about that part of his persona well let me throw that right back at you because in some ways you're just a funny guy that gotten a humongous following a funny guy with a curiosity mm-hmm you've got a huge following how do you psychologically deal with the responsibility in many ways you ever reach in many ways bigger than you are musk what is your what is the burden that you feel in educating being one of the biggest educators in the world where everybody's listening to you and actually everybody like that most of the world that uses YouTube for educational material trust you as a source of good strong scientific thinking it's a burden and I try to approach it with a lot of humility and sharing like I'm not out there doing a lot of scientific experiments I am sharing the work of real scientists and I'm celebrating their work and the way that they think and the power of curiosity but I want to make it clear at all times that like look you know we don't know all the answers and I don't think we're ever going to reach a point where we're like wow and there you go that's the universe it's this equation you plug in some conditions or whatever and you do the math and you know what's gonna happen tomorrow I don't think we're gonna reach that point but I I think that there is a tendency to sometimes believe in science and become elitist and become I don't know hard when in reality it should humble you and make you feel smaller I think there's something very beautiful about feeling very very small and very weak and to feel that you need other people hmm so I try to keep that in mind and say look thanks for watching Vsauce is not I'm not Vsauce you are when I start the episodes I say hey Vsauce Michael here Lea sauce and Michael are actually a different thing in my mind I don't know if that's always clear but yeah I have to approach it that way because it's not about me yeah so it's not even you're not feeling a responsibility you're just sort of plugging into this big thing that is scientific exploration of our reality and you're a voice that represents a bunch but here you're just plugging into this big vsauce ball that others millions of others have plugged into yeah I'm just hoping to encourage curiosity and you know responsible thinking and an embracement of doubt and being okay with that you
