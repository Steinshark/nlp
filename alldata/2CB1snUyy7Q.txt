to survive we need to remember again how to think visually how to think in terms of holes we we're trying to design a new major right now at the college and I can't say what it is but the thing that convinces me that it's worth doing is the beauty of it then the question you know has arisen well is that a sufficient ground it isn't maybe but maybe it is because a feeling for beauty or for harmony it's the fastest way often to discern the health of a situation and health you know is a cipher for that underly underlying you know good functioning so I we're not computers we are you know we're we're biological beings we have that capacity and we don't have the possibility of thought without that capacity this is Jonathan Pedro welcome to the symbolic [Applause] [Music] World hello everyone I'm happy to be back here with Timothy Patia uh many of you have seen him on my channel once before but most of you know him uh you know as a as an author um and uh of the ethics of beauty especially because it's a book that many people that have come to the symbolic world and many people even that are coming to Orthodoxy today are reading as part of their path on the way to that to that world and it offers such a powerful uh Vision you know of of of human engagement and what beauty can do for us and so you know uh Timothy started a new film company that I I just saw the first movie on on St anoos of Patmos wonderful film and so I thought it'd be a great opportunity to maybe talk a bit about that but then obviously continue to talk about beauty and it's import for the for the meaning crisis so Timothy thanks for showing up thank you Jonathan it's it's great to be here and so you know how do you go from you know Professor teacher at a at a C Dean at some point of of the helenic college and now starting a film company what what was the impetus for this yeah that's a good question I mean I I like Cinema I I certainly like um I I think of film as you know I think of it as well I I think a lot about you know how information has been recorded and transmitted over you know human the span of human existence and this idea that you know long before there was writing there were people sitting around campfires telling or Fires at night you know telling stories and it's so primordial and it seems like such a good way to transmit information from generation to generation and and to me the um film on the big screen it is the story is in the fire you know you're in this you're in this you're in the dark the campfire or the fire is the screen that's the light and the story is there too and I think that's just so powerful and such a beautiful experience and any anything that can be told in that way I think is worth trying to tell of course you know followers of Plato will say you know we're looking at the Shadows on the on the wall of the cave and that it's it's really the worst way to tell information but I I think as Christians we don't we don't also believe that we think Christ actually fills the cave up and so the idea that that uh you know Christ f fills up the world with his glory and and all things are it's a different Vision than from what Plato presented you know it's like the images on the wall of the cave in the Christian Vision have a reason for for being there and in some ways they're the ones that would lead you up out of the cave if you were able to see them as an anagogical ladder uh and so I think that it's a it's I think that's a more consistent Vision with how reality functions than the simp than the one Plato presents as just the as the the illusion and then someone kind pulling you out of the Illusions into this this pure light did I did I that's that's so well said did I ever tell you the story of meeting the patriarch of Antioch no it was it was it was a um not the current patriarch but the previous one I don't remember his name maybe it was Ignatius but uh I was at a conference a bioethics conference in 2008 in balamand and uh someone said the patriarch wants to meet you like 100 people at this conference like what's that about and we were summoned to a room and we waited it was like you know one of these sort of appointed rooms and uh his beatitude came in we stood up and took his Blessing there was another guy from Greece and the the patriarch sat down and he said and he had this very classic voice as Patriarchs tend to and his was kind of like a little like rough sandpaper type of voice and I want try to impersonate him but he said the trouble with you Greeks is that you are all dualists and while while we were you know reeling from that opening statement the opening statement yeah that was you asked me to come here I wonder remind you you invited me you know I'm just saying and his next statement was even a rock has a soul and that was it that was the whole meeting that was the meeting and and and of course you know I had done Old Testament here at Seminary so I knew that the Semitic View you don't say I have a body you know you you speak much more in terms of I am a body I am this Unity or or at least my task is to make that integration even more so and um but certainly people think of Plato as you know as having introduced a kind of dualism into the West although although Le shestov thought you know just depend what depended which dialogue you were reading you know whether whether Plato was the problem you know but anyway platinus was good yeah PL definitely PL is I mean and there there's such a connection between Christian and platinus that you you do find some Vision a non-u vision that takes you out of this problem so so tell us now why you started why you started this film company because we haven't answered that question yet I just saw the movie I just saw it last week I was in BC uh at doing a parish Retreat H and uh and someone said the the the the movie infocos saint of Patmos is playing and so there you were I could see you and you were part of you actually in the movie I didn't know you were going to be in the movie as well uh and one of the things about it that really astounded me was you know it was obviously the the the life of the Saint the powerful uh testimony but also not shying away from some stories that were really out there like that were really the story the old lady saying how you know the saint when he was a baby would not suckle you know on fasting days like that kind of of really legendary type of way of speaking about Saints it surprised me and in some ways I thought like of course Timothy's GNA was not going to shy away from those types of stories but I thought it was wonderful yeah um so so what did you think of the film as a film though overall I mean it's it's it's yeah I won't I won't is it well done I enjoyed it of course I enjoyed it you know I mean it's a it's it's a documentary and it has all the the tropes of the documentary you know panning the of the of the the areas with with voice over you know I thought it was very is very uh it was very well done it did it did what it had to you know and I mean I'm also I'm I'm curious to know why you chose that subject as well so maybe you can tell us a bit about you know the the birth of this project so um one of my closest friends is tamaa hudanish and she was the Director of Missions and evangelism for the San Francisco Metropolis so she was on the west Coast I was here on the east coast and we would work together professionally or run into each other when she was in Boston doing stuff and we both had wanted to do something in film or television that would um help people experience pilgrimage so I think both of us felt like pilgrimage is just such a central aspect of renewal and of joy in in Orthodox life and in Christian Life um and we've gone on a lot of pilgrimages um and many times when we've been cool places we've thought if only I had a good camera right here I could just say something even if it's you know 30 seconds or a minute and so we were we were looking in you know in those terms um so we founded Beauty First films and people want to know the film is called aalos Saints of pmos and he reposed in 1970 but we were looking for projects of what to do and that would I mean for me as an educator it's just it's just a different way to educate um I don't mean that a film should be dactic I I mean that you know because obviously as a beauty first person I don't think you know I don't think education is you knowes involves the whole soul and everything but um but but we realize that the first ever feast day of this saint St aalos of pmos was coming up in April of 19 and we realized that it would be like a a very a very um defined window that to tell the story of his life in the words of people who knew him or were big devotees and happened to come to the first feast day on the island of poos I mean the story sort of already writes itself right and and it's not like a six-month production or three-year production it's just four to five days of interviewing everyone you can so we knew it was a kind of a manageable bite-sized chunk and that was you know one reason why we went with it and then of course we loved the saint yeah uh and so is your plan to do documentaries mostly or you also would like to do some fiction I well we this was 2019 so we went from um we went from popos you know through Athens straight to Tel Aviv and we filmed all of Orthodox Holy Week okay that year of 2019 which you know may have been a kind of special moment in time the end of an era you know as it turned out so that is now in post- production so that'll be our next film and we'll just we'll just take it from there I we would certainly like to find you know a more financial support that could get one of us not me doing this full-time because I think we can do a lot more and as I don't know if you've seen our Beauty First films lurgical season calendar so we've got creative ideas and tomama has a a beautiful eye so she knows how to make things yeah you know just yeah you know I mean I think it's a great it's a great project it's a great idea um you know what what do you see because of course you you know you wrote the ethics of beauty uh and how you're involved in making beautiful things um what do you see the role of beauty playing in the meaning crisis in general because you know we both are probably in a similar position uh in the OR for people that that are coming at it and are learning about Orthodoxy it seems like beauty is also part of how they find a kind of solution to the the meaning crisis which would have seen surprising to someone know even 50 years ago would say that one of the solutions to nihilism is beauty but uh if you want to tell us a bit about how you see that function I mean there's so many levels in which to answer that and I I I you know there's more philosophical more theological I mean I I'm just starting with basic biology which is that you know most living things out there are are do not have a cerebral cortex and yet they're making decisions just fine and they're surviving and they're propagating and they are um they are able to discern you the structure of the world you know to the the extent they need to and to to respond appropriately and so you know how are they doing this they're doing this through sensation and if you go down to you know the most basic cellular level it's somehow at the level of chemistry that you know things are you know the parium the bacteria is out there sensing and reacting so to imag imagine that human beings you know unless you are are an exceptional theist I mean not even a theist but a gnostic then then to imagine that human beings can divorce feeling uh from knowing or divorce knowing from feeling and sensing is really ridiculous I mean it's just nuts everything is out there making decisions and and flourishing without the brain I mean yes some things have brains and then that's another story you know why do you formulate it as Beauty because I if you know the way that I would formulate it originally is I would I would talk about goodness you know in the in the way that Dante talks about goodness or in the idea of that which is desirable maybe even just that like the idea of of moving towards that which is desirable um you know and so why is it that you feel the need to formulate it as Beauty well didn't Aristotle say that the beautiful is the radiance of the good or something so yeah so um to survive we need we need to to remember again you know how to how to think visually how to think in terms of holes um we we're trying to design a new major right now at the college and I can't say what it is but the thing that convinces me that it's worth doing is the beauty of it and and then the question you know has arisen well is that a sufficient grounds it isn't maybe but maybe it is because a feeling for beauty or for harmony is you know it's it's the fastest way often to discern the health of a situation MH and health you know is a cipher for that underly underlying you know good functioning so Ian we're not computers we are you know we're we're biological beings and we're you know we're just that's we have that capacity and we don't have the possibility of thought without that capacity yeah I think that's right and but there's a there's an intuitive aspect to the way you're presenting it which is that you know our capacity to perceive health is a good it's a it's a good way to talk about beauty in a way that that might stretch people you know when I look at someone I perceive Health very much so because I'm so I'm my whole being is there to detect that to know even in terms of like infection even something like that or to understand the situation I'm dealing with and a lot of our markers for physical Beauty are really just Health markers and and symmetry markers you know to to to be able to tell you know um how how aligned someone is towards reality um and so we can then we can then uh understand that humans have that capacity in general not just towards people but also towards situations you know when you you enter a room and there's disorder you know you know if people are moving in ways that is not normal like you know let's say you walked into a room where people have just had a fight H you will be able to detect that intuitively without thinking yet because there'll be things will be laid out in a manner and the movements of the people will be happening in a in a in a disorderly way uh and you'll catch that really fast even with before you're thinking and so you know I think that's an interesting way of talking about a very very uh immediate manner in which Beauty matters there there's so many aspects of this and one of them you know I I think you know the the pivotal chapter for the 21st century is chapter 22 of the death and life of Great American cities of by Jane Jacobs my friend and mentor and that's the chapter where she presents Warren Weaver's summation of the past 360 years of science you know science since we've had the scientific method um and he says although science you know is vast and does a a lot of things in fact there are three kinds of problems that we know how to solve three three you know as as a genus of problem there's only three and and and one of them is the problem in organized complexity and what Jane Jacobs does you know the the problem it's a living system it's an organism and Society is like that the economies are that cities are that families are that institutions are that you know companies are that and and when you are in that realm Jane Jacobs gives you here are the tactics for um for here the tactics for understanding those kind of systems and in chapter eight of my book I lay this out and I add several tactics of my own that are implied in her work or that I've so how but an eye for beauty train training in beauty or training in grammar because you know for me Beauty goodness truth is the Trivium of grammar logic rhetoric but training in pattern is is is the best training for understanding living systems or just systems and you'll a person trained they know in a Flash all the all the and and Jane Jacob specifically says this all the statistics that you can compile about and this this case it was Boston's North End just you know they don't tell you the full story but to go there and observe un aage Clues now you said well we better look for different statistics yeah yeah I mean that's and and I think the city example is a great example it in in the sense that you know and I mean everybody's had this experience it's like you're walking in a city that you don't know all of a sudden you take a turn and then all of a sudden you realize that you've taken the wrong turn and that now you know that you're not in a place you probably should be or that you're in a place where all of a sudden the risk has gone up you know substanti and you can tell that even if there's no people there like even if there aren't people there that are suspicious or whatever you can tell by by by a myriad of signs that are that are coming together in a pattern uh you know that is tell say saying that to you um you know and that I think is a great example to to understand and and you can understand how sometimes you know the the the cliche of fixing a city by saying we don't want broken windows right that kind of cliche where it's to say that if you actually transform the pattern of the city itself you can even transform the culture that people live in because if I if I'm walking through a dump I know that I can just toss something on the ground and it doesn't matter even if you I might even not do that but if I'm walking through a place that is cared for and pristine and is full of care and attention then even my worst my worst habits might be rained in by the space in which I'm in I mean that's a powerful testimony to be Beauty right there so so yeah I I think training in the liberal arts or the Fine Arts you know is is vital for people to acquire wisdom or to to lead at a big picture level like you shouldn't trust leaders who don't have a good aesthetic sensibility and anyone anyone could see that our approach to farming this like highly centralized government subsidized the car gills and all this and the you know the the the Eraser of the family farm and of rural culture and the the chemicals and you know of different kinds the fertilizers and the pesticides and all this that compared to regenerative agriculture anyone who with a with a liberal arts degree will know one is is sick and one is healthy yeah but people with trained in the other kinds of science reductive or statistical will not see that and they will push us to the point of collapse and and that brings us eventually now or later to Ian mcgilchrist the master and his Emissary because what what he's doing in that book is saying you know is basically saying that uh this the the brain hemispheres really are meant to unfold in a beauty goodness truth sequence and that we we've lost that we've lost the the right hemisphere we've lost the feeling for holes and we are reflect ly repeating things you know that are good that are driving us to exhaustion and destruction uhuh and so I mean it's interesting because I I imagine when you wrote the ethics of beauty weren't aware of of Y Mill Chris so what is his work how's it transformed your vision or how's it affected the way you you understand Beauty I think it just made me want to kind of just just collapse exhausted like he he we don't need my book we've got that oh my goodness I I no I I think um he you know he he ought to read the ethics of beauty and I ought to finish the master in his Emissary and then he's got this other one that's called the the the matter with things oh my goodness that book it's a it's like if IUS you ever SE it's that book you're not allowed to write books like that anymore we're not in the 17th century it's like this is this is an attack on us this book and so you know I know people that have bought it and they keep it on their table as a as like daunting as a daunting thing I'm not even there yet I one day I will buy it but then it'll stay on my table for like a year before I even touch it but but I mean you know the thing the thing there with just what he shows you is that essentially you're meant that the two hemispheres do everything together but that the quality or the kind of attention that the right hemisphere for right-handed people the right hemisphere brings is is concerned with holes and then the the left hemisphere is concerned with parts and the way thinking ought to proceed he says is this a sense of context handing off to the left brain for analysis handing back to the right brain for reintegration so that's exactly what I lay out I mean the ethics of beauty is you know it's a book about cognition it's it's a book about many things but it's a you know the structure of of what it means to know as a human being not as a computer so it's the same exact parallel um so so no what what is that really add I think just confirmation for me it's confirmation and then he has you know kind of a theory of history of you know that civilizations start out with a balance between the hemispheres and then as they as they as they succeed they get greedy and as they get greedy and gluttonous they start to rely more and more on the left hemisphere they just want they want more and and then this coincides with a a decline in intelligence like real intelligence that Global intelligence and so they exhaust themselves they just drive themselves to destruction yeah and so how do you see that in like a you know this is to me is it there is a challenge let's say I would say to us Le in as Orthodox Christian because you know we have uh at this point it wasn't the case forever but at this point we have something we could call a lurgical algorithm like we have a program we've got it all we've got all the books and we've got a we've got all the all the Cannons and all the matens and you know it's all there and you could run it like you could probably run it you know on a computer you could have a computer running the services and and it would just be all timely and you would have all the right cannons and the right the right different uh the different hymns at at the right time and everything um you know and I I'm being I love Orthodoxy I'm Orthodox I I became Orthodox and so I'm I'm being Playing devil's advocate here but you know there it seems like from the outside there is an argument to be made that there's a danger of that fix fixity in the liturgical practice which is that you know take the book out read the book this is how it goes you just follow the rubrics you know that's how it works uh and that that we've lost the flexibility you know that because we know the early liturgies had more improvisation in them in the sense that then we knew the sections but that there was probably variation in different places in in in some aspects although the Liturgy was Universal um I don't know if you thought about that in terms of like the use of of written prayer and all that if it if it is an example of the danger of of fixing right and of of following the the rules and the rubrics I didn't know I was going to go here by the way this is just it's just came to me no I I've been thinking about this because it seems to me that to to balance these two modes of of awareness the this right hemisphere left hemisphere or the um you know this holism and and a more analysis you need some kind of a ritual that will help you the purpose of ritual and of liturgy is you know to convert chaos into order right it just it eats chaos and it puts out order on the other side and but not just any order it produces Cosmos and I think you know the Liturgy is not enough you have people formed by the Liturgy you need liturgy at fractal scale you need people who have are internally liturgical who are deeply prayerful and deeply repentant and whose Consciousness has been transformed so the point of what what mcgilchrist is worried is that that the left hemisphere deals with a representation of reality not reality itself and because that is easier to work with and it can is more efficient to work with it it prefers it liturgy is supposed to be openness to the radical unkknown and it's supposed supposed to be openness to a God who is so vast that you know without a mediation of liturgy the encounter would crush us and so so hopefully it's the opposite of that um there's really no way to ensure it I mean it's just the adventure of freedom but I think what happens practically you know like this our Saint you know in the movie s onos the moment his spiritual life started to get intense he went straight to S Nar St narus was 75 80 whatever he was and St ocus was 19 18 years old and he would you know travel from one Island you know quite a ways to the other for that guidance and who what other Saints did aalos know well he was the spiritual father of K stare he was the person who tonsured St gabia the aesthetic of love he you know those Saints they run to each other because Beauty goodness truth is grammar logic rhetoric truth comes at this cotal level it comes in some kind of a communion we're constantly it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us and and and and hopefully liturgy is unleashing that cidality but I'm not worried about liturgy for the same reason the the big book of alcoholic annonymous isn't worried about who's who's going to make sure an individual chapter of AA sticks to the rules they don't because they said the disease and death will take care of that and if if people are faking liturgy then you know their their spiritual lives will wander away to nothingness and the organization will dissipate yeah yeah that's a good point that's a good point and and I think that the way you describe it as being held by the lives and the testimony and the the the experience of the Saints you know is is I think that's the right way because obviously you know the fact that I have to go to confession you know you know at some point if I want to commune that's a that is not that's not a program right it's not I mean you could probably do it as a program you know if if you wanted to but it definitely not running a program it is it is it is always terrifying it's always this kind of internal eye this kind of this you know this you know and so to you know and no matter how many times you do it and no matter how times many times you repeat the same stupid sins over and over it still at least for me is existentially uh fills you with that kind of existential Terror that does not have the cannot could not uh traffic in the kind of you know limited certitude that migil Chris talks about in terms of the left brain and and and just of the of this kind of rational understanding and so you know if that is what feeds us through the Liturgy you know then the Liturgy becomes you know a dance playing out you know those inner those inner struggles and that that that inner compunction I mean the reason I didn't you know mention Beauty at first and I mentioned you know protozoa or something is is because um you know to the to the the to Mrs Blowfish Mr Blowfish looks must look attractive it's it isn't yes Beauty in symmetry beauty that is something real but spiritually we are asked to look beyond that or to you know and we are and there's other kinds of beauty that we encounter and that you know we see in the poor or in the in the the person who's broken down by life or um the person you know it's not just it's not there's something sacred about you know a beautiful face there is but you know you start to see other dimensions of beauty that are equally or more important and yeah well I think I think that there even even to argue it from a biological uh point of view you know because life is costly uh and it seemed like it would make sense that at some point humans would be able to recognize the value of those that are willing to make that pay that price you know and so and so the the idea of a of a of someone a warrior coming back that's maimed that's scarred that someone you know a woman who who G gave herself into in childbirth and you know is affected physically and and she has the marks of that transformation it seems like at a at at the very basic level of course you know the beauty like you said you know but but at a at a deeper level and also over over time it seems like it would be necessary that people learn to recognize the beauty of those sacrifices which is why girl girls love scars too chicks dig scars it's sorry sorry to take you off that but you know no no I was I was thinking of something yeah um you know yeah I I think um that's this is true and and certainly the aesthetic of the church which has is not sweet or merely externally perfect but it has you know bare scars within it that joyful sorrow or whatever the word is bright sadness that's that's the aesthetic of the church and um it's more like you know blues or or or blue grass or or Jazz than it is like maybe than like is like classical music although classical music you know depends on the composer had balances joy and sorrow you know in its great compositions as well but Cher Alexander talked about you know that somehow that the building has to age to be truly beautiful it has to kind of you know it has to incorporate the passage of time and that that wear is makes it start to come alive and and glow with with a certain fire I think I think that's right I mean our own experience of things that are supremely beautiful often you know I this is actually one of the this has been my thinking about beauty because you know we we tend to say that beauty is Harmony and beauty is symmetry and all these things and sure and but then my experience of that was that it's just that's not true like it's not completely true it's partly true but it seems like my perception of it it seems like what we find beautiful even visually aesthetically is something like symmetry adapted to a particular it seems to be something like that it seems to be something like balance that is is well suited to a particular situation and therefore it has to Encompass some type of play with its environment whether it is the dings and scratches of use or whether it is a beautiful church that is laid in a slope or whether it is you know so there's this there's always this sense of of order but that is in that is embedded in a particular that is more chaotic or more uh yeah that can be a little that can be off even you know and that that that seems to be part of how we experience Beauty it's you know it's because I mean it's because in the kenosis of the logos you know which brings about the creation of the world the kenosis is so complete that it's continually adapting to the the creature or to the situation of the creature and and this is fractal order right that that that in fractals everything is exactly to its place and um and by the way that's the the Plato's Cave answer too because within the cave is another kind of you know it's at every scale um and um one of my former students um Georgia Williams you know she said I think that she wrote an article about this somewhere um but she said I think that what we call fractals is what dionysius called the hierarchies yeah and and once you realize that the celestial hierarchies and the ecclesiastical hierarchies are fractal shapes then everything you know just a lot more things make sense and first of all hierarchy is not a dirty word anymore it's just fractal structure this is the way the world has to be because what's being given is so infinite or Beyond infinite and what's receiving it is so you know we're so weak and yeah we need and and that's another reason why you know go film look not everything we can't I cannot be in liturgy 247 so what about you know what fills the space fractally other things you know the other times and um yeah that's I mean I think that that's the some of the things that I've been talking about in terms of you know I use the family meal as an example of you know a type of lurgical act which is not strictly lurgical but particip in the same in the same structure uh this and and you could bring that all the way down to having coffee with a friend or a conversation or breathing right it's like these these these structures of of of kind of moving in and out of the mystery uh is there at every at every level and you know the Jesus prayer for example as like the basic liturgical structure for your thoughts you know kind of expands and and and and you know can be seen through all aspects of life and then into the grand Cosmic Liturgy of the Angels uh and I I I think you're perception about how our how it's fractal obviously very akin to the things that I talk about but the idea that that's that hierarchy is actually just the way the world works it's not a and it's not it actually is condescending people always think of hierarchy is something which separates but hierarchy is also something which unites because it adapts it's glaring light to the particular situation you know and sometimes you know we we don't understand that even in our lives we don't understand that we're not ready for the vision of the Divine logos you know it's like you don't want that actually and so you have to when you receive the little Graces that you receive this is this is God loving you right even if it's the smallest Grace it's God loving you because the reason why you receive the grace the small Graces where you receive them is because that is your capacity to receive them they're the ones that can provide fruit you know if if the if the the food was open and the grace just fell on you you'd be you'd burn like you'd burn in hell like you would you would be you would be you would be overwhelmed and so it that's why I think hierarchy is so if we can help people understand how hierarchy what it is actually and that it's not just like a you know Authority and power coming down but it is this condescension of of of authority down to the level that's appropriate you know s St silan you know had a vision of Christ when he was still a novice at Vespers he said afterwards if that Vision had lasted even one more second I would have died and so so that that is that we we and and I'm thinking of a a recent Elder in in Russia who um a man came to him said I'm dying of cancer I want I've heard you you know you're a Mir Miracle Worker heal me and he said do you believe in God he said no then the priest said the priest said do you want to believe in God he said no and so the priest Without Really you know missing Aid he said well do you want to live do you love life and the man said yes and so the priest healed him and this is a true story from the90s and I I think um look I know in the film you know some things happen and are said that you know are you know like like that people like to mock the thing about babies that won't nurse on Fast days um but mother nectaria my other great mentor you know um this was said about some some Elders that you know we knew and she went to Cyprus and talked to like the women of the village and they didn't they just said it was it was the darnest thing deal out of it but it still continues to happen that you know some kids are just born with that much grace but it's not something I think about a lot because that's not my reality yeah well that's why I loved it when you put it in there because I think like a more I think like a more modern type of of person like a modern type of filmmaker would have not put that in because it's so counter the way that that our lives are because our lives are so mundane to some extent but like you said you know the the the Medieval World was full of the these stories and to think that they're all made up is ridiculous it's just the world was just you know some people live in a in a world that is more like more of a dance than ours and and in the moments where you actually experience that dance you should understand that maybe that dance could be 10 times more than the one that you're experiencing right now in this these little moments it is a thing you know but but I think the the danger is you know to to know like Chase those things for themselves yeah yeah yeah the thing is you know the first the first commandment Christ gave us you know in his incarnate Ministry was repent and and St pus said just pray for a spirit of repentance don't ask for anything else because you won't be able to handle it when it comes and and that's the found and if we can just pray for a spirit of repentance and then Miracles can come and go or you know people can tell stories and sometimes you know people tell stories and they do seem kind of made up and you know you let that go and it's it's not it's not a huge thing the point is you know to have your own hopefully you know dynamically alive relationship with Christ and to let let that you know hold these other things along yeah you know and so so the biggest the biggest affront at least on its face to beauty is the cross you know because the cross is it is the most horrible thing you know it's presented that way in in scripture it's it's presented that way in uh you know it's an object of torture and Christ is tortured um but nonetheless we have the intuition and we hear it in the church and we that that in fact the cross is beautiful um and so how do you square that like how do you see that coming together oh I don't know I mean I certainly I somebody said I don't know I certainly find my crosses hard to Bear but but I find yours very beautiful I I find you know meeting someone who's willing to um to risk their lives for me you know I was in a fiery car crash on uh in 2017 and thank God the car didn't tip but you know it was really on fire and um you know as I as I emerg out of the fire just happened to be a fireman getting off duty and you know when I when I thank God that the car didn't flip you know because then that might have just either been the end of me or I would be even uglier than I am no just kidding I would have you know really been you know had all kinds of things going on would be hard row to ho and my faith is not you know infinite um but my main reason I'm happy is that that poor guy he was just coming home from work on a Sunday morning and would he have had to go into the Flames for me that would be awful I mean but had he done it yeah it it's just beautiful that God put him there and that you know that he was ready seemed ready so so certainly um and when we encounter in a relationship that the other person is unwilling or unable or psychologically unready to Bear even the smallest cross for us that's really sad you know that's really that's much harder you know than and and then we re then we realize well we've got to up our game and we've got to carry a few more crosses for the life of the world and stop trying to be so pretty and focus on being beautiful or on being good and then letting the beauty come out of that um H yeah because you know it was interesting you know I never had that experience before but I was at monos uh in I mean you actually helped organize my first trip there by the way thank you I'll say that in public that was wonderful uh but I went back again uh as you know with Jordan Peterson um you know and uh we met the Abbott of the of xenophon monaster we were and you to me that was really something of an experience of of the Deep Beauty because he was a broken old man you know I mean his back was out and you know he had all the characteristics of a a very elderly person who's had a very full life uh but you know it was impossible to stop looking at him like it was some there's something more than just the just the the the usual advertisement you know Hollywood uh aspects of what we find to be beautiful um and it was a visual thing like it part of it was visual not just visual but part of it was visual is that I really he was hypnotizing like it there was it was difficult to stop looking at his face because there was so much simple joy and you know and and a kind of uh presence that was exuding from it uh and so I think I did have like a little bit of a of a vision of how the cross can be beautiful you know although we know when we make icons of the Cross we we're careful you know we try to make it in a way that won't attract to the to the the kind of torture aspect of the of the Cross and I think it's good that we do that but we also know that that's what it was I mean we know that Christ on the cross visually did not look the way that we represent him in a in an icon uh you know we're trying to represent the inner aspect that that that kind of transform aspect but the outer aspect would have been horrible um but I that was the a moment where I felt like I was able to see a surprising you know in someone who is you know old and close to death and and has had this full life of sacrifice that there was something shining so anyways I'm sure other people have had experiences like that but to me that was helpful to help me understand what beauty is you know in a deep in the deepest way well somehow as a society you know we had our kind of Disneyland phase of beauty and you know we took that into our personal lives somehow and expect you know even our spouse or something to be like that but the the um I mean I think you know in mcgilchrist's point is that you know we're in a societal crisis or a civilizational crisis um you know and somehow the thing is I don't think that he can really all he can really do is point very dimly you know to religion or to even philosophy something that to say that the brain you know is function functions in this way doesn't really give you a program it just tells you that you might want to pay attention to people who have the program and I don't know yeah there there is I mean there is a a um and I think that his recent book like I said I haven't read it I think his recent book is different you know in the I think that he is trying to to give more of a of a of a vision of of how to live because it's true that in the master in his Emissary it's it's like a it's a critique and saying to someone you know use your right brain more it doesn't mean anything right it doesn't mean anything H existentially it's not a it's not a phenomenological proposition it's a it's a prop it's an analytical proposition it's a left brain way of talking about the problem when you say this it's a brain problem like it's it's it's an experience problem it's an engagement problem it's it's not actually a problem of the brain at the outset and so I think in some ways he's a bridge because he's actually using left brain way of talking about the world in order to ex to to show the problem uh you know and it helps people kind of understand what it is but honestly like the brain has very little to do with your experience like you do not experience your brain and your brain you know you you you don't your brain is an abstraction in your life it it's not something that you you don't experience things through your brain you don't you know I'm not be careful people understand what I'm saying I'm not saying the brain doesn't do what we say it does I'm saying that it's a it's it's like the motor of your car right you know you drive the car and you have a steering wheel and you have the pedals that's your experience of the car like you don't experience the what's happening inside the motor is is SEC very secondary to your experience of driving and that's the that's also the I think one of the issues with uh not the issues but I think that that's in some ways where mcris and the Master's Emissary kind of leaves us off with this more this kind of technical way of talking about it but uh but I never like I wouldn't use that I wouldn't say right brain left brain uh thinking because yeah I I I think chapter 22 of death and life is is is better in the sense that it just tells you that we have three modes of Science and we prefer the first two because they give us you know the illusion of control and the illusion that universe is a dead thing and the other one is just a lot harder and but the the the fact is see if I were a corporation how would I just absorb all this and try to stay unrepentant I would just say well let's just get out there and you know fund some great liberal arts programs and then just hire their graduates and we'll have them and the engineers you know balancing each other like you would you you could just try to operationalize it like that like we get your artists involved or just get the problem is that life is a much harder form of Art and yeah the liberal arts are indispensable but then you've got to have the way of the heart you've got to actually pursue the sacred and the holy and you've got to do it well and you know it's all that's it's it's education too it's about people that's the you're gonna have to do you can't make it into a system it really is the difference between a good teacher and a bad teacher is the world you know and we know we just send our kids to high school and we just don't know who their teachers are you know and we just but the reality is that all the great colleges were built on people they're not built just on abstract knowledge and uh you know I I was uh I don't know if you know about ralon college I just came back from there did an event there Mill Chris also good things good things yeah and they're they're building it I think in the right way they're building it based on you know it's like connections and people and understanding that you know a valuable person is more than a program that we need the program but to have the right person in the right place you know that has the right intentions uh connecting with the students is more valuable and uh and it's been it's pretty it's pretty astounding what they're able to to do it gives you hope you know for for for liberal arts for sure yeah I'd like to learn more about it of course of course I think helenic college has the edge right now of any liberal arts school in the nation just because the you know the reason I became friends with Jane Jacobs is because I noticed that she was describing cities as if they were really liturgies and and I think when you when you study living you know real real organic life it always has this you know that that breathing that you mentioned that that sign of lurgical living things are constituted liturgically and it's and to have um to have that be part of your college experience now we're if some young person is listening to this and you know they can't come here necessarily we don't have an engineering program but if you can put pilgrimage into your life and get good at liturgy and understand what is the way of knowing that's imparted um of course we have this we have them both here and it's still a struggle that's just life I mean you just every day is a struggle and but yeah in some sense we're the ideal college at the moment although thankfully not no one seems to realize that well we'll only handle 30 freshmen a year but whatever well I can't wait because for people uh who don't know I am going to be at Helen College uh in a few weeks on is it April 17th it's 17 that's a Thursday right Thursday night is that is that when the event is because I have three days but it's it's around there like you're coming on Wednesday and and we're hanging out on Thursday and it's Thursday I think it's Thursday night and there's and tickets are available on Eventbrite all right so on Eventbrite I will be at Atlantic College selling out fast on the 18th so get your ticket I can't wait to see the college because you know I've never been there and so I can't I you know and and I am definitely interested in the future of education and also especially liberal arts education so it's it's wonderful to see an orthodox uh base Community trying to do liberal arts in in the right way I think it's great you know liturgy has to have a you know a component of long being long and boring if it's if it's if everything is as an you know as a purpose function then you remain mired in the left brain and all you're really doing with your Christian faith is doubling down on you know the mistake of the civilization which is to not be Beauty First and is to be so entranced by you know the power of utility that you know you just are you're just a danger to yourself and others I love I love you saying that you know your lurgical life has to be long and boring to people watching there has to be got to weigh out yourself and your own flighty mind and come to something deeper yeah because I mean I anybody who's been through a long lurgical service will notice that at some point your thoughts just go crazy like your thoughts just kind of go all over the place and at first you don't notice it but after you've been through several services say you're like wait a minute I'm not here anymore like I'm just not even here I'm somewhere else I'm thinking about especially you're a creative person like like me who has plenty of things to think about plenty of stories to write plenty of you know so it's so easy to write stories when you're enduring liturgy right it's like oh yeah um but it's it's a good exercise because it makes you realize to what extent you know you're a slave of your thoughts and and of these you know of these lisy uh that kind of drop in so yeah it's good to to do that I I feel feel bad for mentioning helenic I I'm not trying to hijack you know the podcast I I mean but the the because the larger issue though you know is I mean I've been reading a lot of Wendel Berry this Lent I'm trying to make that part of Lent because you know he's calling for some kind of social repentance and you can see how it it really sncs with mcgilchrist and um there is repentance should lead to kind of social renewal and and I think you we see very clearly now that our mental inability to comprehend beauty or its importance or to give it the respect it's it's due is something is a mental state that needs to be repented of and that's what repentance is you know change to renew and transform the mind um I don't I don't know I mean we we didn't get into something else maybe for another time but it's it does seem like you know our civilization is a is a struggle between the nominalists and the realists yeah the only solution is is the symbolic and that's you know what you're trying to lead us back to so I mean I think the things that I'm saying are kind of just very small pieces of that what your work is the main work that somehow to recover the symbolic Vision that's where the nominal and the real are reconciled yeah but yeah but no I think I think that we're both of us are very much in parallel which is why people when they read your book theyve they feel like they're that we're cousins in thinking you know like that that that you're completing some of the things that I I'm saying and I'm coming close to the things you're saying and so I think it's a wonderful Wonder yeah sorry it's wonderful to know you're on my team is what I was gonna say or that I'm on your team that we're on the same team let's say it that way you were saying something I'd never I'd never heard before which which is the best thing ever you said that the word for the devil right is the the avalo to separate is the exact opposite of simal symbol to symbol and that's the that's the best thing ever that really just puts it all right there doesn't it but but this war between nominalists and realists and of course the anglo-american response is to sit on the sidelines and and through this faint faint memory of their Byzantine you know inheritance and the Kelts to to be Skeptics of both you know but but that anglo-american skepticism is kind of wearing out people want the thing itself no I think I think so but you know the thing is that nominalism is is going to is going to end with a lot of is ending with blood like it's it's it's going to become you know the Enlightenment thinking and that all of this is crashing it's all fall it's all falling apart it's happening rather fast covid was a was like an accelerant of all of the the aspects of you know let's say religious impulse and and uh all and you know all of that kind of crashing back in so you know I think that we it's time to deal with this you know it really is time to be able to formulate and to participate in meaning in ways that are fractal uh instead of you know swaying crazily between you know chaos and tyranny which is the tendency that we've that we've embarked on you know I think since the beginning of the Enlightenment um and so I think that being helping people to formulate but not not just formulate theoretically but also engage and practice this fractal relationship between unity and multiplicity at all the different levels uh the music right the music of the sphere is really that that's that's and and the thing the great thing about it is that when people understand it and when people kind of see it it rings so true that once you once you've seen down that once you've seen down that door there's no turning back it might be difficult to do it and integrate it it's difficult to live it completely but once you've seen this hierarchy of practor relationships you can't go back to the to the to the old way I don't think so and so so at least I think we have reality on our side is what I mean you know like liturgy that the the idea that the reality is liturgy is just true and so you know as the more people can perceive it and engage with it it it will win in the end no matter how crazy it becomes you know truth will will will rise there's no there's no other way you know because if you it's like if things decompose and then the seed the fractal seed that came from the tree that's planted in that decomposed that's the one that's going to grow so I know it from because that's how it works and that's actually how it works in the world and that's how it works at all the scales uh you know and the stories tell us about the remnants that are taken out and that are planted and grow again and so I don't see I don't see another another way you know and in his letter to the Soviet leaders Soulja nen you know is calling for societal social repentance for the for Russia because you know he says it's time to you know let the republics go and find their own way um one of his regrets is that all the best Minds were studying military Electronics you know all the young people were drawn to that and they were neglecting the humanities I mean it's such a sacred thing if a person can give themselves to the study of literature and the classics or literature and theology um literature and art all you know there so much the the great you know when we talk about education as you know the great conversation right this this beauty goodness truth or grammar logic rhetoric the rhetoric stage it's blood work but it's it's s it's there's a cidality you've got to enter the communion of saints you've got to engage with the other great writers and the great you know everything or whatever you're doing you you've it's it's they are summoning you and to their company they I no longer call you disciples I call you friends they are summoning you to that friendship and it's just that life is so busy and people don't have time to read to they don't feel at least with film they're getting something yeah but you know audiobooks there's a solution Everyone likes the audio books yeah that's the way to go there's some things that are hard to read with audiobooks but for sure audiobooks have been a lifesaver for me especially as a as a dad with three kids working full time you know it's like and then doing all this other stuff the Audi book is wonderful you know then you want to drive like you actually want to drive your kids places because you get to listen to the audiobook uh so so that's been that's been wonderful and it's weird it's it's weird technological version of the you know the monks reading in the during dinner at the in the monastery it's yes it's not completely the same it it lack I mean obviously it's a it's a superficial version of that but I think that we're attuned to listening to things being told told to us since we're children you know being read to and so I think there's something intuitively right about the audiobook that you can easily you know kind of pay attention while you're doing other things and let it seep into you so so so more people need to um more young men uh in the Orthodox tradition need to come to the priesthood because if the if if that their symbolic Act is you know the defeat of the disintegrative ACT then that's that's a different way to present this calling this ministry because someone has to stand like Moses you know with their arms up um so maybe that is part of the answer just that increasing but all of us participate in that priesthood of the church and that's um I mean the problem is us right like and and that's that's the great thing you know about I think all Christian faith but Orthodoxy in particular I mean the one I know well like you know you you are encouraged to realize that you know you're the issue you're the problem the problem is you I think this is a that's a great way to uh to uh to to end our conversation the problem is you but the communion of the Saints are calling you and not just the Saints but the communion of all those that came before us the great thinkers the great writers those that have you know showed us what is what is beautiful good and true they are calling us into to participate so can I can I mention a dream I had recently because it's so fun I I was meeting LeBron James for the first time and it was such a spiritual dream I was in tears it was it was like this and I was I just said you've you've given so much effort to Excellence you've worked so hard to be excellent on what you do and it just brought me I don't even I'm not really even a basketball fan but I just there's so many people out there giving their all for for beauty in different ways yeah so you know come in come into the dance everybody so Timothy thank you for everything I can't wait to see you again uh at Holy Cross and and at Helen Helen College in a few weeks and I wish you all the best luck also with uh with the the the the movie and the upcoming movie on on Holy Week you know I can't wait to see that as well so thanks Timothy
