ladies and gentlemen welcome back to the Qatar Masters 2023 this is an open chess tournament with some of the best chess players in the world playing including your favorites Magnus Carlson hikarin Nakamura and international Master Eric Rosen my friends we've had a lot of drama in this event already Magnus suffering his worst defeat in classical chess in about two decades looking to make a comeback he Caro meanwhile Chad Sigma whatever word you want to describe it at the top of the leaderboard in today's video I'm going to show you a game that Magnus played against yet another youngster a young Indian teenage Prodigy Grandmaster by the name of M pranesh and pranesh gave Magnus Carlson a heart attack and then I'm going to show you another game that Magnus played against an Indian teenage Prodigy grandmas I mean really it it there was a gauntlet of these players in this event uh pranesh sensing that he could pounce on the world champion not physically also magnus's Tech technically not the world champion anymore but you know the the best player in the world he plays E4 and Magnus responds with Pawn to G6 PES is born in 2006 and magnus's next opponent uh Barat subra manam is born in 2007 I might have that backwards they might be 0607 Magnus is literally playing a murderer row of young underrated players that are probably like a 100 points stronger than their ELO if not more Magnus plays the modern defense against PES he's looking to do this because he wants to create an imbalance he would never do this in a classical tournament against the 2750 D4 meanwhile penes is trying to prove that all top level chess is a bubble because they always play against each other and they don't play against these young guys so Magnus moves three pawns to the sixth rank let me tell you something I don't know the last time that Magnus ever did this in a classical chess format meaning 90minut chess against any any grandm really I I I don't know Bishop to E3 F3 and Magnus responds with this move Pawn to B5 all right he's looking to instigate over here he's trying to dissuade white from quickly castling Queen side and starting an attack meanwhile pesh G4 no hesitation no hesitation whatsoever strikes back on the other side and now Magnus has a difficult decision to make he plays the move H5 he spends six minutes on this move uh and already down about 10 minutes on the clock he strikes with H5 and he's inducing G5 there is really nothing else you can do if you take black will just activate his Rook so Pawn to G5 and Magnus plays Knight F to D7 surrendering space on that side of the board and likely not going to Castle there at least for a while because if you just play Bishop to sorry if you just play Bishop to G7 and then let's say uh castles then you know you're going to get hit with F5 sooner than later in fact you might get hit with it right away so F4 pranesh already put his Pawn on F3 the pawn on F3 serves the purpose of playing G4 and preventing the knight from coming com to G4 but now that that Knight has gone away and G5 controls the F6 Square Here Comes F4 and now he's ready to put the Knight behind this absolute Giga Armada of Pawns Magnus rerouting the Knight to the queen side and then firing a pawn away over there forcing a retreat from pranesh and now Magnus seizing Central space Magnus has turned this into a very locked structure probably white has to push it's not going to make sense for white to go here because Here Comes magnus's H Pawn the position makes a lot of sense it's also not going to make for white to capture he's going to have swiss cheese in the center of the board black is going to get the open file black is going to put his Bishop on F5 or G4 and the light squares are very very weak so PES plays E5 the light squares are very weak but he's got a lot of central space black cannot move a lot of pieces Bishop to G4 Bishop defending and now Pawn to E6 look at this Magnus gets the light squared Pawn formation his light squared Bishop is ready to perish for the betterment of his position Pawn to H3 Bishop takes Bishop takes and now pesh plays Pawn to H4 this move seals the deal on that side of the board that's it black has absolutely nothing to do there anymore the only thing that black has is this move Pawn to C5 at some point likely that move is going to happen if it doesn't happen then white is going to play C3 and dominate one more thing only white can move over here white at some point is likely going to play F5 because either black will have to take like this and allow that or is going to have to take like this and allow Pawn to E6 and the weakening of that side of the board now Bishop to E7 pesh castles Rook to C8 preparing C5 pesh is right there already with Pawn to C3 he is not being overwhelmed by Magnus Carlson he's not being lost in the moment Pawn to C3 is a fantastic move and a very difficult spot here for Magnus because he is so restricted but he is Magnus Carlson at the end of the day and you know that he's going to take over this game at a certain moment so Knight to C4 magnus's literally only active piece the only piece in the position now alive that is not squished on the two back ranks Bishop to C1 takes takes again Magnus has the B file and pawn to C5 that is literally the only thing that he has so he takes it prach now thinks for a bit and plays King to H1 King to H1 is very much a waiting move um it's very much like come at me right and and at this point given that the position has gotten so locked and pesh can't really Force his way through it's now Magnus who has to take over the game otherwise it's just you know nobody's going to make any progress like pesh can play King G1 King H1 for the rest of the game he's fine with the draw he's playing a 2840 he's playing the greatest player of all time he doesn't care if he makes a draw so here comes Magnus looking to take over the game pesh activates his Queen Here Comes Magnus Bishop to A3 look at that look at that Magnus only needed one file there are 64 squares on the board Magnus just needed 16 of them he just needed 16 of them to begin operations in the position he logged down the rest of the board I didn't highlight A7 pesh plays Bishop 2 E3 why is PES so ready to give up the bishop because all of his pawns are already on the dark squares this would be a massive unclogging of his position the best move here apparently for black is to just slow play the computer does not want this move but probably Rook B1 is on the way so Magnus grabs the bishop and brings his second Knight figuring he's going to put another Knight on C4 and then he's going to bring his king or Castle the Rooks are going to come down the B file pesh plays Rook B1 Magnus plays King D7 and all of a sudden and Ju Just just as a friendly reminder of course pesh could have C uh Magnus could have castled but then you are leaving the king here while all these pieces are doing battle you never know what's going to happen over here you never know if there's sacrifices possible so rather than doing that Magnus play King D7 King is very safe and now my friends pesh blows up the board Pawn to F5 he does not care that his opponent is Magnus Carlson he is not going to sit here and Shuffle his King back and forth as the world champion I keep calling him that prepares the B file infiltration he's not going to sit and wait Pawn to F5 I told you about this move a while ago it's a very odd move because after this it looks like black is completely solid but now white has G6 now white has Knight F4 white can very quickly fight back against all of those pawns he's got sacrifices looming Queen to D3 with eyes on that slide the bishop back and then take Knight to F4 then take that then then take on F7 that right so e takes F5 that also looks good but E6 is not possible pesh sacrifices a second Pawn against Magnus very simple Point pawn takes Knight to have four suddenly even though you have all of that beautiful material 21 points of material there's nothing you can do 6 plus 5 11 plus 20 points 20 points of material somebody's got to play defense and pesh here realizes he has the time to go back with the bishop preventing the only plan that black had and now Knight takes G6 as a possibility H5 is falling the Knight reroutes to the center and the g Pawn is a passer oh my goodness PR is dead equal with the with the best player in the world he even though he's a pawn down he's got a monster attack he removes magnus's knight from the board Knight to E5 check Magnus has to guard his But Here Comes Knight F7 Magnus is a pawn up but it is hardly felt and this Pawn is three squares away from queening at all times this is a 16-year-old teenager rated 300 100 plus points Lower Queen to D5 check King to G1 Magnus pushes the F Pawn magnus's F Pawn is now also three squares away from queening Queen goes back to F2 Magnus removes The Rook from the board and plays Rook to f8 trying to kick out the Knight but pranesh leaves the Knight because now Queen to B2 that is very bad news for Magnus oh my goodness Magnus now has only one move to survive and it's Pawn to C5 simultaneously defending simultaneously attacking looking to get the bishop here at which point white would be checkmated the game is hanging on a knife sge penes takes on D6 Magnus is down nearly 20 minutes on the clock he takes with a king pesh plays the best move Queen to A3 simultaneously putting pressure here opening up another front of attack pesh is actually beating Magnus Carlson this might be magnus's second loss to a 2500 in this event in two days oh my goodness Magnus plays Queen to F5 and now pranesh has an opportunity to win the game he plays Queen to A6 check the black king is hunted the only way to go is into the center of the board pranesh has a draw official he can make a draw here with Queen to B7 King to D6 and repetition Magnus cannot go to the back rank because after Queen takes A7 The Rook gets in and no matter where you go it is Checkmate so it's a draw on the board but pesh does not want a draw he takes on C5 he does not secure a draw against Magnus instead playing for a win Magnus takes back on C5 with a check King to F1 all of a sudden there is no check for Magnus the pawn cannot do anything The Rook is stuck behind the pawn this king is out in the open Queen to D5 by Magnus and in this position Peres is winning this is peres's opportunity to land a winning blow against Magnus he has to give this check black is threatening Queen to H1 so it's time is of the essence you have Queen B4 or queen A6 this is the right check the king will run to this rank now you will take with check and after King to D6 you give the same type of check you get your queen back and you continue with the game it's a winning end game because you've grabbed that pawn now if after Queen A6 check black tries to guard then there's Rook to D1 King to C7 check here and the very cool common collected King to G1 making sure there is no more check and if black plays F3 he blocks his own queen king F2 and that's it you're winning this is winning the G Pawn is winning white is winning but pranesh plays Queen to B4 he needed to take a little bit of time he hunts the black king across the board and he wins The Rook he wins The Rook but somehow despite being a full Rook up King to G4 the black king has traversed through the through Death Valley arriving over here and apparently just by the weakness of White's King the position is not winnable Black's King is completely insulated behind the pawns white is up a full rook and is three moves away from making a second Queen but in that time he will suffer the fate of a Perpetual check it is on a knife edge F3 played by Magnus sacrificing his own Rook as pesh he had to do it because if he tried to save The Rook like Rook to F2 that's mate so he had to be very careful here he gives up his Rook for the safety of his king and the position repeats after Queen C2 Queen B1 pesh cannot escape the checks and Magnus has no choice this is not a queen endgame he can win pesh is two squares away from queening my friends the game ends with a repetition of moves and a draw pesh nearly taking down Magnus Carlson up a full Rook for a few moves in this game but Magnus infiltrating with his King and excellent fight but an excellent fight even more so when you know they are separated by 300 plus rating points just incredible Magnus doubled the age of his opponent five-time world champion just unbelievable stuff and pess showed absolutely no hesitation when he felt the position was getting a little bit tedious for him he sacrificed multiple pawns to attack magnus's King he fought Off magnus's plan he infiltrated on the B file the pressure was on Magnus the entire game and he manages to hold the draw running his King across the board just absolutely Sensational stuff and I got news for you it did not get any easier his next opponent is a year younger than pesh and just 15 points lower can Magnus fight off another Indian teenager this is absurd stuff now he has played Four Indian players in the first five rounds of qar Masters he plays E4 this one an Italian subanon playing night to F6 and this kind of offbeat system H6 preventing White from Ever moving anything to G5 also black has possibilities of G5 himself Magnus castles D6 A4 taking space on the queen side A5 possible in the future also C3 and B4 possible in the future Barat plays G6 clearly not looking to be overly aggressive with G5 although it is possible he plays G6 Bishop G7 and sets up like this it's kind of like a Pier's defense King's Indian style Bishop on G7 Magnus meanwhile taking a lot of space on the queen side with A4 and B4 King to H7 17 minutes spent on a king move just a prepar preparatory move Barat wants to play F5 he wants to attack Magnus King to H7 he moves his Knight out of the way and Magnus sees this coming from a mile away but he's still got to make preparations for it uh Pawn to B5 Bishop back to A2 and now Now Pawn to F5 Barat has fulfilled his plan Bishop is no longer hitting a King Pawn and King here Knight slides out of the way Pawn to F5 take Bishop takes D4 and Magnus striking back in the center of the board a very tense position very different than the game against pranesh pesh it was more of a maneuvering game it was more of a maneuvering game in a closed position which then exploded when pesh sensed that his position was in danger here barath with the black pieces is just going straight at Magnus opening up the f file Magnus attacking in the center very tense moment here the best move for black here is apparently this very obscure C5 trying to just add another layer of pressure to the center forcing white to make a decision if something like d takes C5 DC and the queen opens if C5 de then de and the queen opens and if you try to I don't know take on pant then this Knight can come back into the game with pressure on the center but Barat plays the human move which is Knight to F4 looking to land the Knight on D3 I mean who would not like that now Magnus clogs the center with Knight to E4 with pressure on the Knight pressure in the future to jump in also Knight can go to G3 and take that light squired bishop and now Barat gets it's a very difficult moment here for black because he can play G5 he can Again Play C5 and he can play the move he played in the game which is D5 that is a monster decision because now you've completely removed stability from your Center and you are purely re Ling on tactics Magnus takes the Knight and now I think barath realized if he goes here his pawns can't go forward Magnus will now Gallop that way the Knight has no return the bishop is eating Granite this bishop is eating Granite as well like I did as a child at the playground and Magnus will go here trade that off plant the second Knight in the center and slowly outplay him so barath tries to go hey he goes crazy here he takes back in the center that pawn is completely gone that pawn will be taken it does get taken Barat takes magnus's Knight opening up his King and he brings in his Knight but unfortunately my friends even if you just do the numbers here take take take take white do up a clean Pawn the only thing that white has here is the open King that's not very good but he can play Rook to E5 Queen E2 and Barrel down the center with 19 points of material Magnus will likely even win that game Magnus just does something very simple he just gets out of the way and he keeps the bishop of the same color on the board opposite color would have been slightly little bit more Dynamic and imbalanced Magnus just brings that Bishop back Pawn to H5 says you can't attack me barath gets rid of this and now he's going to operate in this position he is up a pawn and nearly one hour on the clock this is a very different type of game Queen to E2 targeting that pawn you can go here Magnus knows how to play End games he goes for that trade immediately Magnus probably has the endgames master class if you don't have the endgames master class you should check go check out the free sample just you got you got to know how to win your end games you got to get a lot of you probably struggle in you get an end game you don't know what to do anymore he does that's why he's 2839 Queen takes B5 this position looks like black has won his material back but Rook to B1 mag do not even hesitating look at that taking that taking that and in this position he actually has a fatal knock out punch Rook takes G7 he can sacrifice his Rook put in his bishop and then get in on the back rank if black plays something like King to H6 you have Queen F4 Queen F7 if black plays something like King G8 you have Queen takes G6 in Checkmate but Magnus he's not interested in all of that he doesn't want to sack his Rook plays here and now actually barath could have played Queen to D3 and tried to sneak into F1 Magnus was relying on this being a completely winning endgame it is but stockfish claiming that possibly you could hold it but I think barath was almost ready for the game to be over he plays Queen to C1 Magnus guards his King and uh Baro tries to sacrifice his Rook to potentially save a draw but King to G3 and there's no more checks Magnus goes here and let me tell you something he's going to win an endgame up a full Bishop so barath resigns Magnus is fighting off these monster teenagers this time one of them had no respect at all I mean he was like PES got a draw I'm about to I'm about to destroy this but Magnus said no no no no no no no I'm going to use all your forward momentum like in Judo against you chopping it all down now suddenly black was just out of attacking pieces the game very quickly transitioned to an end game you ain't beating Magnus in an end game you just you're not going to do it there was a brief moment there it wasn't perfect it was not perfect but poor guy just has to play these 16 and 17 year olds from India every single round but Magnus back with three and a half points out of five meanwhile Hikaru is just doing his thing his opponent Robbie keves uh Dutch Grandmaster now I believe living in the United States uh I played Robbie I lost but that doesn't mean that you know that that does really doesn't mean anything for this game I was very impressed with Robbie in this game uh hikaro played an Italian it was an E4 E5 game they they they did this uh one trade of Bishops and then this trade of Bishops hikaro opting not to take with the pawn because he already put his Rook on E1 so that would just be stupid whereas black did take with the pawn because he had no other choice and also the Rook will potentially be active on this file hikaro is going to rely on play on this side of the board Robbie will maybe play for D5 or a kingside attack and see what happens on the queen side there we go and now D4 excellent stuff from Robbie who has not thought look at his time 135 on the clock every time Robbie makes a move he's gaining time Pawn takes Pawn takes Knight to D7 four minutes spent on that move but the position is still very much in the balance very nice preparation hikaro plays Queen B3 targeting this and this Queen E7 now if you take on B7 Knight D E5 potentially and the queen is getting trapped it it won't hikaro is going to see that but very good play there for uh for Black Knight to A5 instead okay Queen A3 Queen takes now that decision by Hikaru is crazy hikaru's got to 100% be aware this is not terrible that is one of the ugly looking Pawn structures ever ever ever ever ever ever but Hikaru calculates that black is going to suffer for a while and he's going to have to play B5 at some point otherwise white threatens this and he will just transfer his pieces there and the Rooks are going to fire at these pawns for the entire game those pawns are going to have to move so that is where Karo calculates that AB is going to be played now the computer here says just play C5 wait a little bit play B5 in the future but it always says to play B5 it always says to play B5 and that is exactly what happens Rook B8 hikaro plays E5 and black could wait like he could go here and then hikaro might play Knight C4 and hikaro might make a a mega clamp and then you know black can play B6 but but he's he's never going to be able to move past that if white is able to clamp that he's never going to be able to move past that so B5 there it is takes takes Robbie keeping equal keeping equal here playing C4 excellent energetic chess if Knight D4 then Knight E5 now we have a trade happening here take take the Knight attacks the pawn on A3 Hikaru plays Rook D1 and now a big moment in this game hikaro threatens the pawn which cannot be defended the only thing you can do here by black is to take on E5 or to take on A3 takes takes Rook D4 but white does get a little activity in that position maybe Robbie was uncomfortable playing this position with his with his pawn and this pawn and he probably was was also uncomfortable taking on A3 because after Rook C7 the knight's got nowhere to go he can't take on E5 anymore so Robbie in this position must have been inspired by some of my content because in this position he sacrificed The Rook reason I'm not screaming it is because hearu just took the Rook then took uh the pawn in the center after kicking out the Knight and he he he just is winning I mean it was I'm not laughing at the decision to sacrifice The Rook but not all Rook sacks are the the same that's that's I guess what I would say um you know and uh and Robbie just had to buckle down here and take a take the pawn you just had to now it's much easier to move his Knights than my Knights I wouldn't have even made it this far in a classical game against Hikaru but unfortunately the lesson here is sacrificing The Rook does not always work Robbie thought he had a lot of activity here with D3 but he car Rook A2 Rook D3 and now unfortunately just has a rook for a knight or fortunately depending on who you're rooting for Knight D5 Knight C3 trades this off and now methodical slow grind down to win this end game Rook to C5 the Knight is stuck Knight B1 Rook C3 you just you you can't there's nothing you can do pawn to E5 Hikaru correctly evaluating that Robbie's going to have to go for E4 or his Knight is going to get trapped so he does that Hikaru plays F4 the Knight tries to escape but by the time the Knight escapes hearo wins the pawn in the center and this is a winning end game Rook versus knight with imbalance pawns like this white is going to March him down push the king to the back Rank and get in and there we go Hikaru pushing the Knight backwards H4 Rook C7 check Rook C6 the king is stuck and once you get F6 the game is over because Pawn takes Rook C7 King to E6 uh sorry no Rook C7 would not win the game you would actually have to repeat moves something like King to F5 and then Rook to C7 uh and uh this would just be game over you're going to get this you're probably going to get that and then you are going to promote very nice game but I got to I gotta say Robbie was doing quite well what good game from Robbie and I'm expecting big things from him uh in this event uh there were uh many other upsets but I would like to end uh today's video with um a very fun game this is Eric rosen's game against al muaya who is an international master from uh from India and actually mua played against Magnus and Eric Rosen showed up to trap in this game a tyon of Sicilian a sideline chosen by Eric Queen to B8 Bishop to D3 Knight E7 there's the move Eric takes clearly a Gambit clearly something like Queen takes B2 here but Knight A4 and C3 was obviously planned black said you know what I believe you I don't want to take Eric still gave the pawn up Eric still gave Eric just given the pawn up he he's like if you want this you could have that pawn is just hanging but it's like the forbidden fruit Knight A4 Knight B6 is going to happen black is like I'm not going to take the pawn Eric meanwhile Queen H5 look at this this man is playing for the kill Knight A4 looking to infiltrate on that side of the board black plays E5 to fight back Eric plays G3 controlling the center black plays Pawn takes F4 and activates the queen But Here Comes the Knight to B6 finally the queen takes the pawn Eric just hat did his beep on this game Rook B1 and now in this position mua can move his queen or his Queen here instead of that he starts an absolutely catastrophic turn of events Knight takes F4 what this Knight can be taken two different ways while the queen is hanging here but now that Queen is hanging in this bishop can be taken this Knight can take that bishop and then that Bishop as well Eric takes the bishop because you actually probably have to take it back otherwise you take the Queen Eric grabs a second Bishop on his way out forcing the king to move now Rook takes Queen Rook takes and Knight takes C6 and the imbalance here is two Bishops versus a rook which is totally winning Eric plays Rook to F5 where is that Knight going because Bishop D4 now this Rook is stuck the Knight is pressured Knight goes to D7 ER Zips his Rook around the rook's got no moves he completely traps his opponent's Rook look at this I've never seen something like this before Knight C5 Knight B4 The Rook is going to die The Rook is trapped completely on the edge of the board Knight takes Knight takes A2 and when the dust settles Eric is up a full Bishop the Monstrous preparation in this game displayed by Eric Rosen the Fantastic trapping of the rook and he's going to win this game by literally just walking his a pawn up the board he plays Rook to D5 here for some reason I think he's trying to play Rook E5 he does just that and that's it Bishop takes F4 the the Knight is trapped the pawn is queening Eric Rosen winning a spectacular game against a very very strong opponent he's made two draws against 2500s he's now beaten a 2470 in this event we got eyes on Eric Rosen we got eyes on a lot of players uh and uh noer Abdus saturo from usbekistan winning some fantastic games uh and I'm going to try to feature the race for first place in the second half of the event Magnus under attack by Indian teenagers Hikaru looking sharp Eric Rosen having a strong event uh Vali rames Babu the sister of prag the Nando destroying everybody I mean just amazing stuff um I'll see you all for round number six get out of here here
