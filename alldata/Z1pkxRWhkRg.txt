to the handsome and inimitable sponsored Gotham my friends it is Hikaru versus Ali Rea fua fuja with an up and down tournament Hikaru has won his last couple of games and the last time that they played Hikaru won with black he plays E4 and the Frenchman plays the French this this is a rare opening at the candidates level in fact back in 2017 Alpha zero if you don't know the alpha zero chess AI story line watch this video then go to the YouTube search bar and type in Alpha zero stockfish it'll send you down an incredible rabbit hole but it proved that the French was not particularly great there's a lot of lines in the French defense where white can get some sort of Advantage but the line that Hikaru chooses against Ali resa is not the classical line it's not the advance it's not even the positional Knight D2 hear takes the exchange French is what you play if you like to drink room temperature water on a hot day all right it's a sign of a strange person I know there's like health benefits Cold versus whatever it's a weird Choice it's a weird Choice it's like a person who just likes to eat bread nothing on it no butter no Jam no preservative nothing but nowadays with the usage of computers people have started creating some practical difficulties and so Hikaru plays this move C4 and basically the best way for black to play often times is allow white to play C5 and and now there's a degree of imbalance in fact you may remember that there was a game at this very candidates uh where hearo was playing with the white pieces and that game looked uh like this does this look familiar with Pawn coming to C4 well this is the same thing but the other way around and white is playing up a Tempo Bishop 2 E7 now Karo here plays a move I've ever seen in my life it also looks like the dumbest move ever he plays Queen A4 check why would you give a queen check for no reason we always tell beginners I always tell beginners stop giving these checks that don't accomplish anything because now you just get hit with a bishop and you have to come back well first of all he's taking Ali Reza out of any comfort zone he's also making Ali Reza have a bishop on D7 black very well have wanted to move the bishop out and then put the Knight on D7 or put the Knight on C6 and now he has to deal with the inability to put the Knight on uh the bishop on F5 and furthermore the inability to put the bishop here cuz white just goes here so there are some practical difficulties after the queen coming back to C2 both sides develop their pieces Knight C3 and now the massive question in this position is whether or not black can play the move Knight to G4 he could have played it on the last move before it would have lost the pawn but I think Karo had some sort of prep ready like Bishop to F4 but it definitely is possible and then black can immediately put pressure on the center and things like that but Knight C6 is what he chooses and B6 and Hikaru still in his prep but I think he spent a little bit of time here maybe he was just remembering maybe at this point he sort of was just trying to make sure he didn't screw something up taking is not what he wants taking just opens up lines for black not that but this one and uh B6 he plays Bishop B2 alyza now jumps in with the Knight forces the queen to move threatens this move Knight C2 it actually looks like black is just in a lot of trouble uh excuse me white is in a lot of trouble like look at this right like what is going on in white position you you stupid you get punished for playing Queen A4 Queen C2 Queen D2 yeah Hikaru just says no you can't have my Bishop Bishop to F4 what yeah as it so happens he's just giving up a pawn now this is still the top line of the engine I just want to tell you everything Karo has found his way to is the top line of the computer losing this Pawn on C5 being down a clean pawn and then castling is the top line of the engine because now black has sort of overextended it's like in the in the in the Avengers movie all that for a drop of blood right now white is GNA send an avalanche right back at the black position it's going to be a four punch com combination like Cerrone miles jury great F uh great highlight by the way Rook 2 E8 now Knight F2 is possible hikaro plays this move A3 and here Ali Reza can uncork like a seven-piece combination Knight F2 Bishop F2 Rook E2 literally sacrificing the entire house Knight to D3 and he can go for this end game but some oh excuse me not that you would take with a queen I actually don't even know what the difference is I guess C5 apparently and if you take like this there is no C5 there you go you would take it with the queen very important but this is the idea and basically white gets two knights for a rook even though black has two extra pawns but white is better this could have happened instead of that Al Resa plays D4 an equally exciting move shoves the pawn all the way to D3 hikaro asked the [Music] play what in this position the best move was just to bring the bishop back calmly to D1 and wait clearly Hikaru didn't like that very much he didn't like that very much and instead he commits something totally different there's a move here Rook e to which is very scary after it takes takes the best move in this position you can take but you can actually also take the bishop allow a queen and you're doing fine which is sort of deranged instead Hikaru loses his advantage and after D2 Rook E1 black puts the Knight on D3 everything in the white position is hanging everything is targeted F2 is targeted I don't know why hearo would have gone for this now he has to take another free bishop and maybe he had calculated Knight E1 and maybe that was the intention from the start maybe all of this was the intention from the start because Ali res did not think a long time on Knight E1 but the best move here is Queen D7 first waiting threatening two pieces and probably they both missed it now the Knight comes to safety and now you take and the difference is that if white does this Rook e four is just winning now because you threaten everything so before he played the very obvious night takes Rook Ali Resa needed to include Queen D7 and I think they just both missed this idea way back there so I think when hikaro calculated Rook C5 he saw this forcing sequence of moves and you can see from the time spend Ali Resa took his Rook nobody really thought much beyond that Knight takes E1 we go to this end game and Hikaru is probably just winning Rook d8 Bishop C3 he just has to get rid of this Pawn he will trade the Knight he may trade The Rook but not right away it's good for white to have a little bit of help for The Rook F3 King F2 you win this Pawn you just slowly go on to win the end game Knight to E3 by play by L Resa hi Caro grabs a pawn threatening The Rook both Rooks are hanging Rook to E7 and now it is going to be smooth sailing he slowly improves his position he puts the King on F2 he's making maximum improvements apparently King F2 is a blunder cuz black can sack The Rook which is unbelievable and then check and go here and here and if Rook C3 Rook D7 and Knight D3 is coming completely nuts Hikaru plays King F2 Ali Resa misses it now Knight to D5 and the construction is created that's it hikaro was completely winning Knight to D3 Rook back to E8 and Hikaru ruins the advantage again this is so crazy he is half a point behind Yan pishi he needs to win he's missed a couple chances this game the defensive construction here for White against this was Rook C7 check and the Knight coming to F4 so for example regardless you can even play Bishop D2 but let's say Knight to F4 King H6 and something like the bishop coming back to the E1 Square so like Rook C7 King G8 Knight to F4 Knight B2 Knight E1 and this holds the black position completely then you take on H5 then you go on to win hikaro goes here Ala plays Knight B2 and suddenly iaru is probably no longer winning in one of the craziest turn of events of this tournament black is just going to hold everything and now unfortunately look at their time look at the time look at the time they made the 40th move so they both get 30 minutes black is going to defend this Pawn even if white wins the pawn like Rook A5 take take this is probably just a draw King F7 Knight E2 G6 it's probably just the draw probably probably but white still has winning chances but on the 41st move of the game Ali Rea fua kicked the window out and went G5 and that weakens his King an irreparable amount it weakens his pawns an irreparable amount and Hikaru got thrown a little bit of a Lifeline I don't know what Ali RZA had calculated here I don't know what he thought that he had but he literally loses the game immediately Knight D6 Knight C4 the Knight comes back and this is winning because these pawns you cannot protect in the other line that I showed you Black's pawns stay together but in the game itself the pawns fall and now white will win them both and Ali Raa fua resigns and hikaro has seven and a half and he is back in the running for first place oh my God oh my God this is absolutely like this is nuts he has won three games in a row three games in a row now Fabiano Carana vided GUI vid it yesterday lost probably the heartbreaker Game of the Year winning a couple of times against nepo a major question is can the surging Fabiano be held off by vidit will he overpress this one an Italian fitting Bishop C5 a Mainline Italian where white plays the Joko piano Bishop back to A7 we have H3 and now the main line which has been seen in a handful of games actually already at this tournament B4 Bishop E6 take take Queen C2 this was seen in the game Fabiano gukesh which is at this point feels like 30 years ago uh but uh vidit plays a sideline here he he brings the Knight to E7 so the idea is to go for a quick C6 D5 and put the Knight on the G6 Square Fabby has played like this a lot of modern day Grand Masters play like this and very quickly uh Fabi does something really clever here by the way which actually goes on to prove to be a pretty strong point in the position this approach by black is designed to play C6 D5 like this and since black is going to play C6 he's going to have three pawns on light squares which means the dark squares are going to be up for grabs which is why Fabby plays A5 it's a very interesting idea so now we see C6 from vid it and the players clash in the center I mean you talk about gladiators like you talk about old school like see like look at this I mean they are just about to beat each other up in the center of the board but usually what happens when this happens a lot of pieces get traded like you can see here and now you just kind of play the next phase of the game so both Center pawns are gone pair of Rooks is gone a pair of knights is gone again there there's a little bit of control over here but the pawns are the exact same ABC fgh that's not me doing the alphabet I know that there's you know more letters and and now it's kind of on to this next phase of the game now white has a microscopic Advantage he has slightly better pressure he's going to push black back a little bit but it's probably just going to be a draw now videt needs to choose which way to move the Knight and he chooses slightly inaccurate accurately I think he wanted to go to F5 maybe he also wanted to go to G6 in the future but it was better to just go here it's not like a pretty move uh sorry it's not a special move there's nothing interesting about this move but it was probably the best move and he even has ideas to sacrifice later on H3 but he goes here and suddenly vidit is now under pressure on the dark squares very nice technique from Fabiano and uh at this point I think vidit sens something was going to go on with his King so he started moving it like vidit sat here and was like wait a minute I can't do too much like I can't do too much can't move any pawns I can't really move my knight because it's under pressure I'm going to go King f8 and then I'm going to go King E8 he's trying to walk his King over there what so for example let's say Fabby plays like B4 I think vidit is going to try to get his King out of here like why is he putting the king in the center so fi goes after the king a little bit the king needs to go back now now Queen C5 now they repeat the position and Fab's like what is this guy doing like if can I do the same thing King D7 is not going to happen right away because it loses a pawn but like why is vid putting his King in the center of the board well Fabby now decides to open up his own King Rook E4 and the position is getting really complicated no Queen trade vid it play C5 Rook e five Knight C6 nice move by Fabiano and he picks up a pawn and those pawns were weak for a long time and now the king runs all the way it's finished its Journey Bobby was winning here uh if he had just gone for it with B4 and maybe B5 B4 Bishop A4 but he slowed his play and they get to the 40th move and he's still doing very well he gets another chance and fabbi does not let this one go he walks vid well actually he kind of Let It Go B5 was the better move but he was worried about this sacrifice but there is the ridiculous defensive move Knight to G1 which I guess Fabiano did not see holds everything A6 takes all on the way and uh White is completely winning Fabby plays Bishop F5 and slowly methodically rips apart vided guti's King wins his Knight and wins this game and Fabiano caruana is back in the mix with seven hikaro seven and a half Fabby with all the people who have a chance to win the candidates are winning their games um vided unfortunately two losses in a row he's out of the running it's impossible to win the event now but um I think it will be like a career defining moment for vidit like he was probably the most exciting player in this event he still obviously has two rounds to go it's not a knockout but um yeah I uh I said before the event that I thought Prague would have the best chance uh of the with three Indian players that has been proven to be wrong GES is doing spectacularly but Prague is in the middle and there's still some time to go now we will look at all the other games as well Prague played nepo today was a ridiculous game uh I didn't even put his score there I will uh now here's a matchup in the women's side which is which is was a Spanish and a muuk having a tournament that she's not playing up to her standards but shy has had a crazy tournament she plays an open Spanish today an open Spanish which gets very complicated very theoretical line uh black takes the bishop and has the bishop pair and muzichuk plays very aggressively but for the first time in the event is probably out prepared quite a lot I mean she is uh usually the one up like an hour on the clock and she gives up a rook just straight up gives up a rook and the idea is to put the Knight on the dark squares bring the bishop out somewhere bring the rook and Vali is under huge pressure from the early game but she starts fighting back H5 not waiting around to get steamrolled puts the King on G8 kind of like vidit defends on the light squares look at that the king snuck out on the back rank a lot of walking Kings today and then she plays F6 and Anna walks in and her Pawn is going to fall Rook E7 and DC and and and and and Anna starts getting desperate here trying to hold the center together Bishop D3 disconnecting the pieces from each other white just keeps marching forward but black is ready there's not much you can do there the pawns will will reach a conclusion and uh and actually black has complete stability here and Anna just can't come to terms with it really she keeps trying to fight back but there's no way through she plays Knight to E6 and Vali just defends the position Rook E7 you can't take you can't take like this because you lose your queen can't take my queen first because of this and if you play Rook E7 there's check Queen D6 we go to an end game where black is just up a pawn and Rook D2 is on the way and vce shali goes to an endgame Bishop F7 calculates this out and this is completely winning King G3 King D6 she just has to not mess anything up what an expertly played game from Vali rames Babu Bishop to G8 prevents promotion this Pawn is over here it takes 57 moves look at that look at that look at that the pawn makes it but there is a check and the diagonals are cooked King to B3 stops the promotion King F5 Queen B1 check viali has just won three games in a row she has five and a half out of nowhere she had two and a half she lost four games in a row she's now won three games in a row what is going on she's having a crazy tournament a crazy up and down event now not every game is affecting the standings the women's side actually only two people the Chinese players actually have a score above 50% like to be 5050 well 50% is 5 and a half out of 11 only two people are above that right so you kind of and everybody else is sort of tied in the middle this one was a quick one this was a Catalan from gka and humpy and uh black played A6 H6 a bit of a sideline and you could say white tried to get something going in the opening but yeah there was a lot of uh pressure on the black position G can even sacrifice the piece here which instead of getting taken if Queen C8 had been played uh black is just winning apparently because you play C5 and um it's a totally dominant position Knight E5 you're trading the bishop the queen comes out you even have a chance to trap the bishop in here humpy could have been winning in this game but it I I don't know I uh instead of that we had a big simplification black still had massive pressure here and um here humpy did something kind of uh wild uh the engine gives Bishop d8 with a minus two Advantage for black it's tough to understand why but I think it's because black basically plays Rook A6 and C6 like Bishop d8 pinning this and white is stuck so if you play like Queen B4 trying to get out Rook A6 you're just stuck you don't have enough time and humpy repeats moves and makes a draw in a completely winning position which is kind of crazy if she was playing to win the tournament but she just didn't see this bishop d8 idea as and I mean I'm only seeing this bishop d8 idea because I'm analyzing the game afterward I you know there's a chance I would have missed it as well kind of nuts Bishop d8 with the idea to build this sort of barrier against this bishop because white is actually just completely stuck uh but they drw gkin on Six Points humpy on Six Points uh but they are not in the running for first place because tanr is running away with the event and leting J is catching up to her lagno versus Lei lay goes for a French we have an advanced French black needs to win this game she needs to win this game if she's going to win the candidate she plays a provocative line a line where black trades a lot of pieces in the center and then long castles getting into a complicated back and forth slugfest with lagno and from the opening white is doing very well uh black is doing very well Bishop C6 absolutely dominant cd5 Bishop D5 look at this position and these pawns are coming down the board sniped Queen A4 you just defend yourself Rook D1 Bishop E7 Rook C1 L just goes G5 how is white going to deal with this Leia's about to get eight out of 12 she is dominating this position white tries to find back now the best move here for black is something really weird it's to play A6 and in a nutshell the idea is to play B5 so if white tries to trade Bishops you play B5 you then trade and then you trade the Queens as well so you take your space advantage and you play this end game this is what the engine is saying is minus three but when you have a position like this you just try to rip open your opponent's king and that's what she does and then she plays Knight to D4 forcing defense she hunts down with the pawn she plays G4 opening up the white king takes takes F4 Bishop to H4 now Queen H7 is on the way not right away but you know don't lose your queen but Bishop to H4 Bishop E4 and lei is completely winning the winning idea here is Queen B6 you may ask what does that do the pawn just goes to B3 Knight F5 Queen B6 Knight F5 and in a nutshell like let's say white plays A3 the idea is Knight E3 check if white tries to defend Knight E3 check by taking you take and queen H6 is completely Unstoppable obliteration with Rook on D2 so takes takes Queen is coming to D2 or to D5 White's King is completely compromised so the winning move is Queen to B6 lay plays Knight F3 she sacrifices the pawn to open the king but it's not enough and somehow white survives the king just stands in the middle of the apocalypse and is like wait a minute I have another lease on life and this is reminiscent of yesterday's game where Lei saved the game instead of losing if she had played Queen B6 and went that way with the Knight she wins she just absolutely wins the other idea of Queen B5 and coming in here is winning Knight F5 and that is the way she had to do it instead she jumped in and the white king survives and lei the best she can get is a draw she sacrifices but this is not a winning end game she makes a draw she's only at seven and a half and tandr Y already had 7 and a half to start this round so she has to lose and she's playing against Sova and I will show you that game in a moment prongue before this game had five and a half points all right yesterday suffering a defeat to Hikaru and he plays a French also and in a shocking turn of events in the first game of the day we had an exchange French in this game we also have an exchange French and then we have one of the most idiotic looking exchange frenches I have ever seen 9 7 A3 what is this this is not chess why are they developing their pieces like this why is the white Bishop not going to F4 or G5 but rather here this looks like 500s are playing chess but apparently this is some sort of meta because Jan is not thinking very much he's just not like he he dug into his you know Memory Palace of random meme ideas and the Knight you know coming to E7 this obviously some sort of deep preparation from both sides then they decide we're going to push both of our H pawns right he was trying to Target prague's H Pawn and then a couple moves later they decide that they're both going to Castle Queen side so they're not castling short at all Prague has an active Queen we have Knight A4 and nepo has attacking ideas over here so if B6 Queen A6 you get a massive attack Brewing over there Knight back to f8 putting the knight in the center also trying to copy his Pawn structure because it's very good then he offers a queen trade now taking here is bad you double your opponent's pawns but you give him unnecessary pressure on your Pawn so he says no thank you all right Brock says B6 and a move later Neo's like nah let's trade the Queens so Prague wins this opening battle for sure uh Yan doesn't get my neck is so stiff oh my God I'm kind of under the weather today so had like a sore body like the whole day we trade queens and um the computer gives a microscopic advantage to the black position um I mean they have a completely symmetrical structure and same side castling so not really sure what they're trying to get at Pawn to F6 very tense we start trading some pieces and uh we go to an end game of Rooks and knights there's a little bit of discussion to be had here like Rook F takes Rook E8 but Yan plays King D1 and uh Prague doesn't play this the best way the computer wanted him to go C6 and then bring the knight in that's what it wanted it it was claiming this is his biggest advantage of the game at a whopping minus. three but he plays King C6 and then he plays for B5 and he definitely had sustained pressure in this end game Yan here plays G4 the winning idea not winning idea the idea to play is to give up and then play Knight C4 which doesn't strike me as particularly human it was always a bit tense this game uh but Yan defends himself as he has literally every round of the candidates basically ever and it was a little bit scary with these pawns but Yan stops it just in time nothing to choose between these two guys and I got to tell you probably prague's tournament is also over um being one and a half points out of first place with two rounds to go is an insurmountable deficit and he could still finish with eight and it would be an incredible result but likely he will get seven or seven and a half um but his tournament is likely over as well and nepo continues to maintain first place but he's tied with Hikaru now another person that is seven and a half is tongi and like I said in this game if she loses leting will remain in a tie with her for first place we go to an end game this a good strategy from nurul tanang loves to attack it's a big attacking player always looking for complications and Nuru catches her in a really unpleasant position Bishop C3 Rook E1 Knight C5 Knight E3 E5 black is getting absolutely walloped her pieces are all scattered all over the board B6 and now she tries to fight back she makes more weaknesses Knight E4 Knight D6 was also very powerful putting the Knight there and then trying to go there but nul just plays Knight D6 and as a pawn up just a healthy Pawn with a totally winning position she plays Bishop C6 Rook E7 kicks out the Knight and in an insane turn of events the lowest seed and the youngest player in the women's candidates is beating the leader whether it's nerves whether it's a form of pressure like G4 hold it all down F5 is also completely dominant and now G4 white is completely completely winning F6 she starts offering trades Rook D4 Bishop D4 Bishop E5 the Knight goes to C5 like the bishop is hanging the pawn is hanging you're going to trade it's totally winning Bishop here she trades excellently done B3 kicks the bishop out Bishop E4 I'm just playing a perfect game absolutely perfect game Bishop back to E8 G5 Knight F7 Bishop D5 complete dominance absolute Master Class display F6 okay not the best move the the better move was G6 which is tough to play because you kind of want to attack the rook and now black just can't move anything and you play Rook a one and then you just you you win cuz black can't defend this Pawn so Rook here you try to get in another way you can also offer a knight trade and yeah I mean it's complete domination King F3 black has no king move it's the most dep the king is in jail basically she goes F6 takes takes Rook C7 she's still winning King F2 A5 now it's getting a little more complicated but she's back in the driver's seat AB Rook H4 King G8 Rook G4 okay let's convert it let's bring the Knight yep what nurul needed to just take this pawn and continue to slow slowly improve her position she went Bishop F7 maybe just blanking on Bishop F7 Knight E5 maybe blanking on the fact that Rook F7 you can't take on F6 I mean you can't defend F6 there's no way to defend it maybe she calculated this Rook f8 Knight E5 which is winning but you don't have to do that The Rook can go anywhere and on the 50th move of the game after dominating from move 10 the advantage is gone and black makes the draw I mean there's still a little bit of drama and white is still playing for something but that's it and tanr Y remains in first place by half a point oh my God what a game from Nuru I don't know how she's going to sleep and that brings me to our final game of the day nijat basov versus gukesh if gukesh wins this game he is tied for first if he loses this game his tournament is over and he's going to play for a win and he showed us that on the fourth move of the game when in a position that has been reached hundreds of thousands of times he has played a move nobody has ever seen before surrendering the entire Center to n basically preventing Bishop to G5 and then a few moves later he demonstrated the other a of the move H6 which is one of the most disrespectful pieces of preparation I've ever seen in this position the idea of Pawn to H6 I swear to you is to play Knight to H7 this is the chess gods of old are the legends may they rest in peace are crying watching this game from the heavens what even is that and you know what nant to his credit reacted perfectly and got a very nice position but this is exactly what kukesh wanted a complicated game with an unconfident opponent 45 minutes down on the clock and all gkes is going to try to do is take advantage of the structure over here in the long run that's all he needs he creates another imbalance of giving white the bishop pair but having the Knight on the board and bringing it back and and now launching an offensive on the queen side but this is so risky this is so risky from gukesh Bishop pair for his opponent dominant position he's infiltrating but how is he possibly going to attack the white position well the whole point of the opening was to give white two fat Pawn weaknesses and suddenly a brilliant positional decision to trade Queens creating a mirror image Pawn structure for gukesh is the right decision because without Queens black never gets mated without Queens it's just a matter of time until I come collect these pawns without queens that Knight that idiot Knight that traversed the position is going to get back into the game and it is going to become a hero G5 the Knight Comes Alive it goes to E7 Rook B8 and it's going to come back to the center of the board it's going to plant itself on D5 in the the future or on F5 and D4 and gesh Sh played this game like shades of Magnus Carlson he's not playing in the candidates but I got to tell you right now if we compare a person who who takes their opponent completely out of prep in a must-win game with black navigates the ensuing middle game like a genius makes all the right positional decisions and wins an endgame that's Magnus Carlson that is modernday Young Magnus Carlson gukesh sacrificing the pawn you can't take it because of the fork and by the time that white does stop the pawn black comes in with the king and the bishop and the hero the freaking hero of this game I swear to you the script writers could not make this any better it is the freaking H Pawn H5 white resigns because the pawn is going to promote that was the pawn that started everything on the fourth move of the game sending this whole game into a of weird tactical ideas and positional ideas and he wins the game 53 moves later by moving the same Pawn here and your standings at the end of 12 rounds literally could not be closer here are the standings Lei and tan are dominating the women's candidates but in the open AKA The Men's nepo gesh Yan uh sorry nepo gukesh Hikaru and Fabiano caruana are separated by half a point with two rounds to go and before I let you go today let me tell you the pairings tomor not tomorrow tomorrow's a res day um April 20th Hikaru plays nepom Nishi in the final round of the event Hikaru plays gcash I will remind you these are the standings he plays the people leading the tournament gukesh uh plays fua and Hikaru those are his two nepo nepo plays Hikaru and then Fabby so in the final round it is Fabiano with white versus uh nepo with black and in the final round it is Karu versus gukesh this is going to be absolutely insane this is going to be absolutely insane see you all in a couple of days for this tournament tomorrow I will be uploading as usual get out of here
