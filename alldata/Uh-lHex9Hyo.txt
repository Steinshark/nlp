Here we go we go so this is almost final draft of the cover we've got our own boxes produced we've got our own cartridge mold produced those not too upset saiga we've got our own logos on them big evil corporation cartridges thirsts So the physical side of it is nearly ready to go want you to do now is finish the game we caught up with you how long ago was it i finished the first level which is split into three acts and it's got most of the main mechanics running thank you a bachelor when the kickstarter right it was mid kickstarter yehud kickstarter yeah yeah yeah and obviously for those who haven't seen that video your kickstarter was successful which congratulations Thank you very much wait with it then what's happening with the game um yeah it's taken just over a year so far to get To this this point from the kickstarter we're about 90% finished there's a few audio things to fix up Some bugs and it's going to head for closed beta testing So i expect in the next couple of months we should have our gold build i understand things took off quite recently with yeah You got a bit of exposure when perhaps expect yeah i did an interview for the bbc i had a pr campaign Planned to drop at the same time as the video it went a bit earlier than i expected i was on my way to an event called play expo in blackpool and i got a phone call saying that was on the tv so i have to quickly pull over on the motorway at the starbucks and quickly launch our website it was a bit of a hairy move have you had a lot more interesting start there Yeah, it's been quite mani the past couple of weeks since that interview went life how other people contact me for magazine interviews and videos and podcasts and things like that it's been non-stop For the past couple of weeks let's be frank now did you quit your job for this yes i did quit my job for this for better or worse So what's what's going on long term then long term Once we finished up releasing the megadrive version we're going to port it's the dreamcast And then it's coming to modern consoles hopefully if the publishers are on board with it After that we've got another two games up our sleeves so we can do this all over again you're saying we and does um you work with people on this are they sort of like characters you work with all the time or yeah for the first game i work with some contractors it was mostly myself making the game though For the next one i'm not sure i could stomach it again so i think i'm gonna hire some stuff We see quite often people indie games producers getting stuck in a rabbit hole of working on their own game for years and years and years how do you avoid that Do you know you don't but you Know i suppose the question is it looks like you're getting near to completion so it feels like there is light at the end of tunnel where as we hear of games getting stuck in development hell for want of a better word Is do you think this is something to do with the limitations of the devices you're working on rather than yeah I think that play some part and there's only so much we can do on the rugged drive and we can't upgrade the graphics engine we can't add much more to it we're out of rom space we're using all four megabyte of the cartridge so There's nothing more we can do to the game we've got, no space in ram rom we've got no, cpu cycles left we've maxed the whole thing out Which is a both a curse and a blessing because we have to say this is it now we've got To polish this up and release it and feature creepers is not an issue here when's the when you slated for release what's the latest kind of eta the plan is mid 2018 where we're penciling in late may early june at the moment and it has its own set of registers These aren't general-purpose registers for adding numbers and stuff each one has a specific purpose so one will be in control of the background-color 16 to d1 so we can see that d1 changes to 16 in hex and then add the two together
