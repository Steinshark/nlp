when Marvel started their Multiverse idea this is of course an idea that has been there in comics for a very long time but when they put it into the movie world I became a little worried I guess more than worried I had the impression that they were going to use this Multiverse notion to bring about you know the kind of diversity inclus inclusion Equity stuff that is so popular now and that they would use it as a way to replace characters uh with everything that is kind of uh in line with the current political thinking and we had a little bit of glimpse of that where in the Loki series they seem to be using the Multiverse notion to replace the male Loki with the female Loki and as the Siri goes on you know the the this feminine female Loki becomes more and more prominent and at the end it seems like the series is about her or something and you saw that also in the uh animated what if Series where every episode seems to be about something like that and so I was of course thinking that it it was a kind of a post-modern tool because the whole Multiverse idea is a kind of post-modern tool in itself but then I was quite surprised when I saw the recent Spider-Man movie no way home and in the Spider-Man movie no way home I saw something that I've been thinking about for a very long time that I've been meditating on which is the possibility of turning post-modernism against itself or rather transforming the chaos and the fragmentation of of the the and The Meta awareness and the irony and the comment upon comment that you find in post-modernism and turning it into something like an apocalyptic type of Storytelling so I think that it's surprisingly enough in the no way home movie we get a glimpse of that and so that's what I want to explore with you today of how no way home is a kind of Spider-Man apocalypse this is Jonathan Pedro welcome to the symbolic world [Applause] [Music] so if you're really interested in this question you really will want to look out for Tom Richard Roland's book sacramental imagination in which I've written a chapter that deals more extensively with this and how it also connected to the rest of comic book history and to kind of this uh certain themes in comic book history which which bleed bled out into popular culture but in terms of no way home which you have in the no way home movie is this break-in of the metaverse and what's really smart and witty about the way they did it is that they treated the metaverse as a way to join together the different iterations of Spider-Man movies that have existed uh you know in in the past 30 years or whatever and so at 20 years I guess I don't know exactly how long and so what happens is as The Meta versus bridge then these bad guys start to come in and the Spiderman come in and it is there are three versions three series that have existed in the past several years one which of course we was with Toby McGuire Spider-Man then The Amazing Spider-Man with uh Andrew Barfield and then ultimately the MCU version with Tom Holland and so what's interesting about it is it has all the kind of post-modern characteristics first of all it's very meta because it treats these different iterations of the franchises as universes that kind of coexist which they do in the story world and then they take this these stories and they drag them into one story so first off it's something like what Avengers was in the first place it's something like the superhero team Motif which we've seen in superhero comics for a very long time which is the capacity to take independent Creations like Spider-Man Wonder Woman Superman which are not created by the same people and but then bring them together into a common story which usually has more Cosmic stakes and can and creates this kind of you know Legion of Superheroes or all the different superhero teams that exist now there's something about that which is very fascinating uh and in this version and in the Multiverse version and especially in this particular version there's a way in which they kind of expose the story structure of doing that by taking different iterations of the same story and smashing them together into to one one giant movie um and so there's like I said there's a kind of self-awareness of Storytelling in it and in the movie there's a way in which even some of the comments about the different characters bring this about so a simple example is that Andrew Barfield was part of a an iteration called Amazing Spider-Man which was less popular and less critically acclaimed and in the movie The Character the Spider-Man the Andrew barfo Barfield character he you know kind of he kind of uh you know uh let's say demeans himself and Compares himself to the other Spider-Man and says how his story is not as good and he's not as good an iteration of Spider-Man to Spider-Man to which the other two Spider-Man answer no no no you're amazing which is a reference to the name of his own iteration which was The Amazing Spider-Man and so there's kind of a funny uh comment but it's also an interesting meta narrative it's something like they they are showing us the fourth wall without breaking it like an in-story version of the fourth wall where they're aware of their story of their story existence um and they're exposing it inside the story you saw that in in a certain kind of let's say uh 20th century authors like Borges who talk who have this notion of the you know the the characters in the story that are self-aware that they are characters in the story there are many many iterations that in kind of post-modern Storytelling so you have that but because it's like an in-world awareness and and it's something in a way in which they expose the fourth wall without breaking it which is which is actually pretty interesting as a as a way to approach this thing now the most important part which helps you show that it is an apocalypse like what do we say what do we mean by Apocalypse Now an apocalypse is when we talk about a revelation like in the Book of Revelation it's something which is with both shows the end of something but also is a revelation it's a revelation about the pattern and this is what is happening in this this movie and so it's not just about kind of bringing in these different kind of Spider-Man they do it in a way that in instead of the usual post-modern technique which is to kind of jam in all these different uh type of stories what I what I tend to call it a collage type of Storytelling so think for example of American Gods like Neil gaiman's American Gods where he takes all these gods and jams them together into one novel into one story but he does it in a way that is that is fragmented and kind of ironic and also idiosyncratic he's constantly trying to show the idiosyncrasy of these incarnated Gods as if they're just regular people that just happen to be Gods so you can really see a postmodern move in something like American Gods or the different versions of this think uh of stories like Shrek for example that take all these fairy tales and jam them into one story so this is the collage technique of post-modernism and in the Shrek version what you have is again a kind of cynical inverted a play with the fairy tales in which you kind of uh upend expectations you turn things upside down you know uh the hero is the ogre the princess becomes an ogre the prince is is the bad guy um etc etc etc so you you you always you're always upending expectations you saw many many versions of this type of of technique whether it be again uh in the fairy tale World there was that uh Disney series Once upon a time there was a DC vertigo series called fables in which is all this kind of dark retelling of fairy tales where all the fairy tale characters exist together now this of course is taken to some maybe to his extreme in something like American Gods where all the gods kind of coexist in this cynical uh fragmented world that lacks Unity now what happens in the Spider-Man movie is it seems like it's going to go down that road and it's pulling in all these bad guys all these different characters but what the story does which is different from something like American Gods is that it uses the collage approach to bring about a revelation about the Spider-Man pattern and to bring about a way in which it is actually kind of restored and helps you show the unity of the pattern within its Multiplicity so how does it do that first of all what's interesting about the the Spider-Man Story the MCU version of the Spider-Man is that it's already a kind of idiosyncratic version of the pattern so if you know the Spider-Man story from the comic books the MCU version is very odd because Spider-Man appears you know first of all he doesn't seem to have an Uncle Ben his Uncle Ben obviously didn't die and then his Aunt May is Young he's also very quickly becomes rich and famous and has all this power which is given to him by being in contact with Tony Stark this is very different from the the the comic book character who is a teenager who's poor who's like a struggling journalist and he has all these kind of the problems of a regular Joe while all the all the while trying to be a a superhero and the poor part is important he's always kind of struggling and he sews his own costume he's always having trouble with his stuff and so so it's already it's almost like hinting at the metaverse in this version already it's hinting at the variations on the Spider-Man theme and so in the movie what they do is that they take that and now they bring it together and the way they do it is they have the different characters the different Spider-Man character heal the sins and cover the sins and the the lacks of the other Spider-Man characters this is really a very genius storytelling technique so let me give you a few examples of how that happens now of course in the Spider-Man so there's a lot of interesting things that happen so first of all you kind of see this exploring of Multiplicity and this exploring a multiplicity in a way which makes you actually see the deeper pattern and doesn't kind of show the idiosyncratic part of it and so like I said in the in the original Spider-Man version Spider-Man uh one of the part of his origin stories is that before Uncle Ben dies he he the one of the the last thing that Uncle Bill tells tells Spider-Man is with great power comes great responsibility then Uncle Ben dies because Spider-Man is out there you know trying to make a bunch of money and he lets a criminal go by him without stopping him and so because of that Uncle Ben dies now that that part of the story isn't in the the MCU movie in the first movie iteration the Toby Maguire version you do have that and that leads Tobey Maguire to be to be kind of part of the cause of the death of the guy who killed Uncle Ben he wants to kill him and then he does end up dying and ultimately it also leads Toby McGuire to the death of Norman Osborne the the the Goblin and so this is something like the failings of Toby the Toby Maguire Spider-Man you know his sins and his failings the things that weren't brought together you could say so in the MCU version now you have this really surprise powerful moment when Aunt May says to Peter Parker with great power comes great responsibility and when she says that although it's completely different from the original story when she says that if you know the Spider-Man story it will cause an Insight in you and you will understand that she is going to die and you're going to know that before it happens which is something that in movies usually they tend to want to do the opposite they want to kind of bring something unexpected to you and that is what was going to cause Insight right so I make you think that he's the bad guy and then I then all of a sudden I reveal that he's the the other person is the bad guy misdirection which is which causes Insight now this is a different type of insight one one which we which is actually part of very very ancient storytelling which is a type of insight which comes from knowing the pattern and then seeing a variation on it that that brings you into the pattern itself and so when Aunt May says with great power comes with great responsibility they're they're spoiling what's going to happen you know that she's going to die but the way they do it causes you to have insight about the nature of the Spider-Man pattern so it causes this this interesting little moment of insight um so that is something which is going on now in this version Norman Osborne kills Aunt May after she said that to Peter Parker and so this leads the Tom Holland version at the end of the movie to try to kill Norman Osborne and the person that stops him from doing that is Toby McGuire so Tommy McGuire stops Tom Holland from killing Norman Osborne and in doing that he is doing three things he is healing first the fact that that he participated in the death of of the one who killed Uncle Ben that he was part of the death of Norman Osborne and he also stops this iteration of Spider-Man of going down that path and so they're using the variation on the patterns to kind of heal the different sins and so one Spider-Man heals this his own sins and by doing that he's also kind of covering or preventing the other one from going down the same dark path he has it's quite interesting storytelling and another version of that is of course in the Andrew Barfield version so in the comic books Spider-Man loses his girlfriend Gwen Stacy Gwen Stacy Falls and Spider-Man is incapable of catching her and she dies and this is seen as one of an important move moment in Marvel Comics an important moment and also a kind of maturation of comics where Comics move into a more mature form of Storytelling now this version of the fall of Gwen Stacy was already given a Twist in the Toby Maguire version of the movie where MJ Falls and Toby Maguire is actually capable of saving her and so there's already an interesting kind of variation on the pattern which is about this woman falling and whether or not Spider-Man can catch her and in the version of the Tommy McGuire version he does catch her now in the the uh Andrew Barfield version It's Gwen Stacy and he's not able to catch her she dies so you can see that it is this interesting kind of variation on the pattern and you know it kind of shows you the multiplicity but now in the MCU version Andrew Barfield is the one that now saves the falling MJ and so the MJ from the MCU Universe She the MCU version she falls like Gwen Stacy like the MJ from the first uh Toby Maguire movie and Andrew Barfield is able to save her and in Saving her he heals his own incapacity to have saved uh Gwen Stacy in knowing that he saves the the the one that his that the version of the MCU version of the of Spider-Man uh his own love and so it's like he's not even doing it for himself he ends up doing it for Tom Holland but in doing that but also in kind of looping up his own problem and his own sin he's able to kind of heal himself but also prevent that damage from going to the the current version of Spider-Man and so it's it's really powerful so it's taking this weird post-modern moment of we call intertextuality and so you have all these threads of of text and Spa and and um and variations on the Spiderman pattern you know the the different Falls and saving and not saving all the possibilities and then it wraps it up in a nice bow and reveals something about the nature of the Spider-Man pattern and kind of heals the Spider-Man pattern at the same time so it's very interesting and so ultimately you can see how all of this leads to something like the end of a world and the end of the world is shown in the the Spider-Man movie in the MCU version as the end of The Avengers moment and so you see the Statue of Liberty they're putting up this like weird uh Captain America shield on the Statue of Liberty and then it because of this fight around the Statue of Liberty The Shield Falls and kind of breaks and it it reveals the Statue of Liberty again and so it's the end of The Avengers uh cycle of Storytelling it kind of brings about a new version of the storytelling and it leads to everybody forgetting who Peter Parker is and so there is this forgetting in death but the forgetting is also at the same time a very powerful remembering remembering in the sense that because the forgetting of Peter Parker happens in Peter Parker sacrificing himself what ends up happening in the movie is something like a return to the the garden and return to the Garden in this virgin or maybe something like a New Jerusalem or a Heavenly Jerusalem coming down in the Virgin it means that it's a recapturing and a re-entering into the original closer to the original comic book version of the story and so the movie ends with uh the Tom Holland version of Spider-Man basically becoming poor again becoming a kind of unknown guy uh all the people that I realized knew who he was now don't know anymore so he moves into this in this like slimy New York apartment and you feel like he is now closer to the Spider-Man pattern that we knew from the 1960s when when um when Stan Lee wrote the character and so it this is what I am thinking of when I can see this as a kind of you could call it something like a Spider-Man apocalypse so what's interesting and I think what's important for us to understand is of course I mean who cares about Spider-Man what's interesting about it is that it shows us a way into apocalyptic storytelling and it is something that you could say that both my brother matsir and I tried to do and are trying to do with God's dog you won't see that at first and the first book but as the story progresses you're going to start to see how what we've been trying to do is take this moment of post-modernism this moment of collage this moment of Multiplicity and use it towards something like synthesis towards something like uh bringing back a a universe and Universal story pattern so it becomes like so the Spider-Man movie and this approach to storytelling we could call it like a meta hero's journey where it's not just within the story that the hero goes down into the abyss and kind of comes back up but it is actually the story structures themselves this going into post-modernism this breakdown of Storytelling right this variation this kind of excess of variation and of potentiality which now is kind of bringing being brought back into something like mythological a new mythological approach or a apocalyptic version of Storytelling so you can imagine something like a a Bach Fugue right where you have the statement at the beginning and then you move into variation and variation variation and you're always trying actually to kind of see hints of the pattern in the variation within the Fugue and as you move closer towards the end you can kind of see the the pattern returning and finally we have this kind of final restatement of the original pattern and I think that this is something that we saw we can imagine that the the no way home movie was doing and it is something which I think that if you're interested in storytelling it is a type of Storytelling that we need to be very attentive to and uh can make it make it that we are even we can explore idiosyncrasy we can explore the strange we can kind of use even the strange to surprise people in a way that is revealing a mystery about how the pattern ultimately comes together and so I hope this was useful everybody hope you enjoyed it don't forget that I have a much better version of this this video and a fuller version in the upcoming book by Richard Roland so check it out and thanks everybody for your support and I'll talk to you very soon
