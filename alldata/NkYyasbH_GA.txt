Hey, what's up man dude guess what I just bought a new car. Yeah dude, it's a Kia. Hello Hello huh Hello, everyone and welcome. Cars today some of them at least are getting pretty dull so for example the new Mitsubishi Eclipse is now a crossover we're losing the Ford Focus RS and the U.S. is losing the Fiesta ST but we're gaining the Ford Edge ST thats exciting right so while everyone in america is buying crossovers Kia is making something of all companies very exciting. This is a Kia Stinger GT. This is actually the GT2 spec so it's the top-line (specs shown on screen) Pretty impressive numbers this one that we're in is rear wheel drive they do also offer it an all-wheel drive and the all-wheel drive has a very clever center differential so it can send 50% of the torque up to the front or you can put it in sport mode and send 80% of the torque to the rear wheels. Now the base stinger gets a 2 liter inline 4-cylinder twin-scroll turbocharged engine still fairly potent 255 horsepower 260 pound feet of torque so regardless of what Stinger you get into you're going to have a decent amount of power now the weight changes dramatically depending on what you get so you know the base are gonna be around 3,600 pounds you add 200 pounds for the v6 and you add another 200 pounds for the all-wheel drive V6. So if you get in the GT with all-wheel drive you're at 4,000 pounds which is a decent amount of heft but you know this is actually a pretty nice pretty comfortable ride and so you've got different driving modes you can kind of change the characteristics of the vehicle I've got in comfort now enjoyable here in the rain and actually quite tame with the rear end so the rear end hasn't been getting all that wild on me the tires doing a nice job, and when you get into the GT which we are in you upgrade the tires and the suspension so it's got an electronic suspension electronically adjustable damping and you upgrade to Michelin Pilot Sport 4 tires and these sport for tires are fantastic wet or dry they've actually the compound is designed so that in low you know lateral scenarios the inside of the tire is designed for wet grip and the outside of the tire when you're in high lateral speed scenarios is designed for dry grip so even in these terrible conditions that I'm driving in today. I've got good acceleration grip and fantastic braking grip with these tires and also another cool thing that they do with the suspension here one of the things you kind of notice is the steering in this car is actually quite responsive and that comes down to the tires and also comes down to the suspension one of the cool things they do with the suspension as its electronically variable is they soften up the front and they stiffen the rear and that's at low speed so at low speeds you've got a soft front and you've got stiff rear and what this does is it makes it more responsive it makes it more eager to turn in less likely to understeer and then as you increase your speed as you start to get in higher speeds it stiffens up the front and then it reduces the stiffness in the rear the damping stiffness and as a result and gives you better stability so you're less likely to oversteer at high speeds so a very clever way that they're manipulating the suspension in order to maximize you know how the car feels at low speeds, but also maintain stability at high speeds and it is certainly noticeable the steering is actually good, and I don't know if I've ever said that about driving a Kia it's it's pretty impressive. It's an electronic rack it's got a variable ratio depending on how much you're turning it in and that steering rack they've got the motor offset, so it's not in the steering column it's separately mounted on that steering rack and then it helps to improve the way it feels and it does actually feel pretty good now as far as these different driving modes you've got five smart eco comfort sport and custom, and I have found myself enjoying comfort the most which I've been surprised by in sport you know I was trying out the paddle shifters this has an 8-speed automatic transmission developed by Kia and you know this it's probably one of the few things about this car that I'm not totally thrilled on the the shifts are a little rough, and they're a decent speed, but there's a there's a little kind of uncertainty to it as it switches gears it's kind of got a little hesitation there which you know, it's it's not the smoothest transmission, but when you put it in comfort mode it loses a lot of that characteristic that it has in sport, and it seems to be just as quick except now it's actually a smooth transition, and you don't get that hesitation that notchiness that you feel in sport mode so I've been enjoying comfort mode driving in this car. Now every manufacturer likes to talk about the Nurburgring this car was developed on the Nurburgring. They say that every prototype that they developed spent at least 480 laps going around that quite long circuit and so you know they really have punished this vehicle out on a track to prove its performance, and that's pretty impressive you know 3,800 pounds is quite a bit of heft and so to have a vehicle that can be punished for those 480 laps in development handle the high speed cornering handle the significant amounts of braking you know the cooling requirements that are required to drive out there on a track and drive hard is impressive so you know it's it's kind of something that in the automotive world has come to become this cliche of like oh, yeah we developed it at the Nurburgring, but for KIA to do that you know that seems pretty special they brought over engineers you know from other big-name German manufacturers, so you know there's there's a lot of ingenuity, and there's a lot of clever designing that's gone into this vehicle the interior actually reminds me quite a bit of a Mercedes and I don't know if that's you know necessarily bad that it looks like they're copying it but the interior is quite nice so kind of just like Mercedes. They've got you know this pop-out infotainment display right here kind of looks like an iPad going on you've got you know the circular air nozzles beneath it for your climate system. Even the speakers. You know the metallic speaker covers look a bit similar, so there are many similarities, but you know that's not necessarily a bad thing you've got a heated steering wheel you've got heated and cooled seats. You've got all these luxury amenities. You know adaptive cruise control and this is a Kia, so you know you tell your friend that you bought a BMW, and they're excited because you said you bought a BMW and you tell your friend that you bought a Kia, and they're not excited because you told them that you bought a Kia but the reality is you know none of us are looking at 3-series BMWs as they drive by it's not like we're snapping our necks to check out the latest 3-series this is a legitimately cool very capable legitimately fun vehicle, and it has a badge that people aren't thrilled to say oh yeah, I drive a Kia it's got the performance that matters and it's going to you know actually entertain the person who's driving it and that seems way more important than flashing around your ego and saying okay I drive you know something with four rings around the front on the front of my car is it actually a legitimately great car you know maybe yes, maybe no, but for less money you can get quite a bit of performance out of this thing zero to sixty and four point seven seconds with the 3.3 liter you've got four piston Brembo brakes up front two piston in the rear 15 speaker system 720 watts there's a subwoofer under both the driver and the passenger seat the sound system in this is phenomenal it's got a tremendous amount of bass good clarity to it very great sound system, so you know there's not a whole lot of sacrifices really that you're making I mean, this is a truly pleasant very nice and genuinely fun vehicle to drive the brake pedal you know it's got a sporty feel to it. It doesn't have a whole lot of travel it's you know more pressure based as far as your braking the throttle decent mapping with that you know there is turbo lag, but it's it's not bad if you get up into those higher rpm put your foot down yeah, there's a little bit of turbo lag. I mean it's certainly noticeable, but it's not bad and the thing actually sounds quite good I don't know if it's piping in you know artificial sounds or not ignorance is bliss in this scenario. It sounds great actually especially for a v6 and a turbo v6 which tends to just kind of mute the sound this actually sounds quite good when you get on it and an impressive amount of grip out here in the wet so are your friends gonna think you're cool when you tell them on the phone that you bought a new Kia sports car no they're not going to think so but once they get in it once they ride along with you this thing is genuinely pretty fantastic I mean my few complaints are that I don't think the 8-speed automatic transmission is all that phenomenal and your rear-view visibility is pretty poor. It's pretty cramped up back there as far as looking out the back and so you know blind spots fine out the front is fine it's a little narrow up here, but the rear visibility isn't all that phenomenal and you know I think there could be some tweaks to the transmission that would make it a little bit better but again in comfort mode for the most part. It's pretty nice so overall I've quite enjoyed driving this. Thank you guys for watching if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below.
