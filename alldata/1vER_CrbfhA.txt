ladies and gentlemen welcome back to the best world championship match that we have had in over a decade and I don't say that necessarily in terms of the quality of the games but I do say that in terms of the excitement it is game number five between and dingly Wren it's two to two with both players having won the even numbered game to inform and we just had a rest day for ding to celebrate and look to build momentum and for Yani bomnishi to look to stabilize and Stave off Ding and then try to win the match in the later stages um also this is not my house uh obviously slightly different layout please do not be alarmed uh we begin with Jan going back to playing the move E4 now you might remember or maybe you don't uh Jan played this in the first game and he won and it was a Spanish and then for some reason that I can't really fully explain uh he decided to play D4 but again this such as life like sometimes you pick and choose and you know you want to see what your opponent is playing so he goes back to E4 E5 and we have a Spanish because Jan likes the Spanish and ding likes to uh play on the black side of a Spanish we have A6 Bishop A4 Knight F6 all of this has been played before dingly Wren is not a Berlin Player move three Knight F6 made popular in the 2000 world championship match between Gary Kasparov and Vladimir kramnik that's completely useless information to you you can use it to win a local trivia night at a bar or something um but this main line is much more popular uh for Ding and in particular ding really likes to put his d-pawn in the center in one go now I told you in the beginning of the very very first game um that the move rookie won is extremely popular but in the first game Jan played the move Bishop takes C6 and the game got very wild very quickly he played like rookie one and it was a massive massive surprise so obviously a dingley ren in the last several days has spent his you know his entire effort learning this uh but besides rookie one and then you know black playing B5 and then trying to play castles and then playing D5 and one go entering the Marshall Yan plays yet another opening called an anti-martial which is just a way to prevent black from succeeding in playing D5 and that is the move D3 you see folks in the mainline Spanish after B5 Bishop B3 castles uh and let's say white playing like H3 or C3 black can play D5 uh in in one move um and you'll notice that white is trying to play D4 in one move so for something like you know black plays D6 where I can play H3 D4 and so on um but since white has already committed this Pawn to D3 even though it's only gone one square the point is that white has now abandoned the D4 idea and so now B5 and D6 now of course could black Castle probably I think D6 is considered slightly more accurate and this position with D3 has been getting a lot more attention recently at the highest level of the game and the reason for that is people are sort of tired of playing uh you know these kind of like systems uh they're they're kind of tired of playing C3 and trying to deal with the Marshall um now already there is an inherent benefit here for Yan why is there a benefit because ding would feel significantly more comfortable with his Pawn on D5 I think over the course of his career uh he has played many many more games with opponent D5 but now Jan does play C3 and H3 H3 is already once again a rare move I think Knight bd2 here is more popular white trying to play A4 and play on the a file is more popular but he plays H3 and now in general Black's ideas with the pawn on D6 involve attacking this bishop sending it backwards and taking Central space with the move C5 entering what traditionally would look like a Spanish except White's Pawn is uh normally on D2 and The Rook is on E1 so the pawn is back and The Rook is there and that's kind of exactly what happens we have Bishop to B7 and this just kind of looks like a Mainline Spanish opening um but it's I mean it's very complicated it's extremely complicated you will notice by the way Jana has spent a minute on 10 moves that's not an exaggeration he literally has played 11 moves he's about to play his 12th move very quickly as well in four seconds by the way how fast is he by the way like physically moving the piece um all of this is clearly his prep like he has prepared this entire thing and the reason he prepared this entire thing and knows everything that's going to happen is because of this very you know this very move D3 all the way back here by forcing ding completely out of a marshall he is able to predict the next sequence of many moves and the intricacies of this position are as follows it's a closed position how do you know that because I just told you and you should listen to me also because both sides have eight Pawns so both sides have built up giant fences all right imagine you have a house you have a fence your neighbor also has a fence fence another fence it's probably quite closed off from each other you start looking around and thinking like what pieces are interacting these pieces this might interact with this this might interact with this this Knight controls a little bit of empty space and if anything white is going to love to land right there because that square is sort of it's open it's very open none of those pawns really control it which is why the move Bishop G5 is important because if you trade the bishop for this Knight Bishops aren't very powerful in close positions Knights are and in the long run let's say this bishop is the only piece surviving in Black's position and this is the only piece surviving in White's position the Knight on D5 will be a god it will never be touched ever and even though the bishop is technically better than the knight in many positions the Knight on D5 will be an absolute monster which is exactly why Jan precedes the capture on F6 on the very next move um and uh a very one more kind of like very important thing here after A4 um is the move A4 in and of itself is very new it was only played I think once and it was played in a game ferrugia who you might know he's a world famous fashion designer uh former Grandmaster uh and uh and Anish Geary and this game was played in Miami uh in 2022 the famous tournament where Hans Neiman said that the chess speaks for itself um and then neither of those players said that though and in that game I believe uh giri played Queen D7 defending the B5 pawn and he went on to lose not because of the move Queen D7 but because ferrous is a very good fashion designer uh and uh Bishop F6 Bishop F6 ab5 ab5 and the following position Jan has still only spent two minutes on 15 moves that's terrifying your opponent hasn't thought at all now the amazing thing is like his position is I mean it's it's nothing special um but again if he can land a piece on the D5 Square that's sort of all he's hoping for um that's that's essentially it uh and the thing about this position for black is he can't really do much like his Bishop is bad this bishop is not great um he's gonna have to start going backwards and uh kind of taking a step back to try to take two steps forward um so he plays Knight C6 but what is the night what is Knight C6 do well Knight C6 opens up the Rook but it closes off the bishop oops it closes off the bishop and now here comes Bishop D5 this is the move that Jan has wanted to play all along so was it worth ding playing Knight C6 could ding have done something else yeah try to find a move that does something else for example let's say queen B6 okay just like bringing the queen out I'm gonna play Bishop D5 anyway and here's the thing if we trade Bishops right and okay but you're trying to get the knight from A5 back it's really hard to do that and in that time I'm going to put my knight on e4 and then I'm going to start some sort of attack why am I going to be able to start some sort of attack because your pieces are just having a smoke break on the other side of the board all right like your piece is just not doing anything this bishop is not doing anything okay black might play G6 Bishop G7 I I mean I I don't know um so he plays Knight C6 and Jan thinks for eight seconds and plays Bishop D5 I mean this is insanity uh now I mean again ding is feeling the pressure he is down 28 minutes on the clock and his opponent is not thinking I mean imagine you're sitting there thinking like one minute two minute trying to find the best moves blah blah blah and and your your opponent is just playing every single move instantly I it's it it's not a good feeling it's a nauseating feeling in fact now how do you deal with all this right like how do you how do you improve your position well um Rook A1 ding decides I'm gonna trade the Rooks and the truth is let's just get to some sort of position uh okay this is obviously unlikely but let's just get to a position with no queens and you know what no Rooks either Rook A8 Bishop A8 white is a little bit better white is a little bit better uh because white has an opportunity to potentially you know instigate on this side of the board and because this pin is probably going to last a very very very long time but Black's drawing chances I think increase quite substantially in a position with less pieces on the board ding decides I'm going to trade Rooks and then I'm going to play Queen D7 and I'm gonna put my Rook over here and even though ding is down 33 minutes on the clock that might look intimidating his position is completely fine so he's actually doing a very very nice job well yawn plays rookie one still instantly but nothing scary ding takes the a file Yan rotates back to D1 completely instantly now Bishop back to d8 so essentially ding spends another seven minutes and now he's thinking of a best way to reroute computer is showing he can play some random Rook move he can like undevelop his Bishop he plays Bishop d8 with the intention to play Knight E7 when you are under substantial pressure especially on the clock in this case 45 minute time Advantage for yanyupomnishi dingly ran is thinking to alleviate the pressure with concrete play very few people sit there down 45 minutes on the clock and go I'm just gonna play the best move no you're always looking for a tangible solution and as a human besides looking for a tangible concrete solution you also just want your opponent to just stop effing moving like you just want your opponent to not move anymore and the bad news is Jan still only plays a move in about 90 seconds um and he doesn't necessarily remember that the best move is Knight F1 he just might know that it's one of the ideas uh he had other ideas but the idea of going there is that he wants to play Knight E3 and then again control that square so ding plays Knight E7 and the unplayed bishop takes Queen takes and the battle for the D5 score still rages on you cannot play the move D5 because you have only temporarily stopped your problems you have now significantly weakened this Pawn so Jan has everything firing for him here the bishop on d8 is terrible the Knight on E8 is very very passive this Rook is I don't know it walked into the middle of a forest and is trying to throw a frisbee to nobody like there's nobody there um he's gonna have to go across the board and like get it ding plays Bishop B6 Yan still maintains a 44 minute time advantage and here decides it's time to play for a win with the move H4 all things being equal he has maximized everything all the pawn structure in the center the Knight placement and now he is going to try to take as much space away from ding as possible by moving his H Pawn to H5 you will notice that for the first time this game uh he has actually spent some time Bishop to B6 H4 seven minutes spent on that move it is official 23 moves to actually use his brain in this game that is crazy I don't know if his prep was that deep I don't know if he's just got the world's best poker face H4 and black cannot stop white from playing H5 because if you do that you immediately grant me a Target and ding spends some time plays Queen C6 and Jan plays H5 this subtle maneuver on the same side here just completely restricts the enemy Knight and it doesn't just restrict the enemy Knight it also improves chances in all end games why because the black structure cannot move and so it's going to be a lot harder for black to do anything anything you commit will lead to weaknesses and I'm still going to try to play Knight H4 Knight F5 and get to the light squares if white can play this and put a knight on D5 white wins from a positional standpoint so it's time for dingly run to no longer sit around doing nothing he needs to play C4 and let the comeback begin dangly Wren fires into white center with the move C4 his dark squared Bishop has come alive if he gets rid of that Knight and white does not get a knight to D5 black is going to be completely fine in fact black might even be better because white overextended with his H Pawn and because black has an open a file so the move C4 is on the board Jan thinks and plays the move d4 that weakens the E4 Pawn but it's not capturable because of various tactics like this like this like this like this so you cannot take ding plays e takes D4 Knight takes D4 and plays the move Queen to C5 and this officially is the moment in the game where yanyupumishi has doubled up his opponent's time and has the best position that he's had the entire game and he messes it up and the position drops nearly down to equal it was better apparently for Yan to start with Queen F3 to try to set up various discovered attacks and then if you try to blockade him there is Knight G4 to try to escape you know to try to kick out the queen and then you can try to play for E5 Queen F3 was apparently a little bit better because after Queen to G4 you which looks of course very natural trying to infiltrate there is this incredible move by ding Queen to E5 and suddenly Jan has nothing officially for the first time this game he has nothing is absolutely nothing and that is why you know he tries to kick the queen out of the center of the board and personally I I mean I don't know I mean I think he played Queen G4 completely anticipating Queen E5 but the point is that now this infiltration doesn't actually do anything black will simply capture on D4 and we will trade all the pieces so Queen E5 and dingly Wren is back in the game for the first time that is the lowest the eval has been in a while Knight to F3 tries to kick the queen out Queen E6 you cannot trade Queens here because as I said once black relieves the pressure it is black who is probably going to call the shots with the bishop with the open Rook on the file with the fact that this Pawn is actually probably quickly becoming a liability so Jan plays Knight F5 ding can play two things here he can take the Knight but he can also rotate over and take nothing and the queen guards everybody Queen's like yo come here Queen's like huddling everybody together during a basketball game all right that's also a possibility in this position though he did in fact take on F5 e takes F5 is a double attack on the queen and now do you play Queen F6 or do you play Queen to D7 and ding plays Queen F6 now he could have played Queen D7 Queen D7 was a better move it guards all of the back infiltration and it also stops white from advancing with the move F6 and if you try to move out of the way in order to play the move F6 I can first of all actually play F6 myself but if any super Grand Master plays F6 in this position uh the hand of God will come down and slap them so probably you can rotate the bishop to F6 you can also play Queen d8 and you know try to put the queen on F6 later um but Queen F6 but now Jan centralizes Rook B8 this has been stopped and Jan plays rookie 2 just a simple improving move seeing what ding wants ding slides the bishop forward a square nothing cooking and now how does white tip the first Domino to try to finally apply some fatal pressure on black not just cosmetic well you start looking around what do you have that they don't and what you have that they don't is this and you will notice a long time ago I told you Knight versus Bishop right the Knight could end up on that square it's a light squares dark Square situation every single piece is on a light Square this bishop is entirely useless and Jan plays G4 and this is very bad news ding now bolts out of the F6 Square realizing that blockade was futile he had to put his Queen on D7 Jan slides gently forward to D5 applying pressure in a multitude of directions the queen is a cancerous piece on D5 it is unbeatable on the D5 Square King 2 f8 is played here to prevent rookie seven the idea here is that black wants to go here and here if black can get the Queen off the board he will be fine but had he had played that Rook to E7 would have been played that's why King f8 was played in this position Yan goes full Terminator and plays King to F1 with two ideas the first idea being that anything that gets taken on the G file will no longer be a check which will allow him to move forward effortlessly the second thing is if the F Pawn ever comes to the party the bishop will not be pinning the pawn to the king so King F1 is a useful move black is officially out of moves black has officially got 20 minutes on the clock to make 5 five very important remaining moves Rook C8 played to try to trade the Queen off Rook to E4 Rook to B8 back and Jan has arrived Jan has arrived with the move G5 will dingly Ren be able to fight him off H takes G5 Rook to G4 looking to collect in this position didn't maybe had one last chance to not capture but he captures yanyuponmishi immediately goes to collect the material F6 looks like it holds everything together but unfortunately there is the absolutely brutal and this is why the H Pawn was so important remember he played H4 H5 because Knight H4 to try to get in here and if you take it looks like there's absolutely nothing but the H Pawn is the final Domino to fall and that's it if you take it's made in a few moves Queen G8 and Rook G7 what an absolutely ridiculous idea Knight H4 Against All Odds it looks like black created a giant barrier to repel the Knight there was no barrier the horse has legs it can jump and that is why instead of that Ding tries to go for counter play against the king White's King is completely blockaded on the light squares this bishop unable to do anything both pawns far Advanced and like every good strong Grandmaster Yan knows an attack does not need to culminate with the head of the king being held in your hand he is more than happy to trade the Queens because at the end of the road is a winning end game and that H Pawn is going to become a massive asset it's either going to win you upon and the F Pawn will be the past Pawn or Pawn takes and this comes through and so F6 G6 take take take and in this position one final thing you actually cannot rush if you try to rush and win the game there is this completely ridiculous turn of events that might happen where it looks like white is queening but instead of queening white will sacrifice The Rook for the pawn and actually draw this game I mean it's completely nuts um Jan is a strong player he does not fall for that he plays Rook H6 red carpet for the king to infiltrate Checkmate is coming and in this position dingley Wren resigned game five of the world championship and Jan took a 3-2 lead so for the second time in a row game one and five we have a Spanish we have a sideline not letting ding get to his Marshall and the second time Jan has a very pleasant position and this one was never in doubt he made one inaccuracy not to claim his Advantage but the entire game revolved around this and the final dominoes to fall was this fantastic sophisticated h4h5 idea followed a little bit later by this idea to play G4 I mean this is incredible stuff this is like a master class of same side attacking chess he should be very proud of this game and um it's match on we've had three decisive games in the first five it's three five nepo he has struck back he has not looked to stabilize the ship with a draw that was just about as smooth of a win as imaginable and ding has some soul searching to do in his E4 E5 spanishes I'll see you for game number six tomorrow's recap will be delayed by the way by like two three hours I will not be present in front of a computer when the game will conclude I've tried my best but probably won't so stay off the internet for two three hours tomorrow with Sunday I don't know what do you do on Sunday go outside go for a picnic uh get out of here
