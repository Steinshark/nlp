this box contains evidence that intel infiltrated the education system in a nefarious scheme to teach kids about electronics engineering and computer science all while pushing their own products and branding onto children what dark horrors could lurk within oh wow that's just adorable maybe this isn't so bad after all let's journey back to the long lost year of 1996 and see what intel thought we needed to know like i think you need to know about our sponsor build redux they make it easy to configure your new build with support guides to help along the way they also offer competitive pricing as compared to building a pc yourself so head to buildredox.com linus and start your new build today [Music] first things first definitely a plus for the box design like if you turn it around here you can even see that they modeled the back of a computer it's it's adorable right inside we have one classroom-sized poster i can't fit this in the frame i'm not even sure if this is in frame yeah it is pretty big oh that's that's funny is is that that looks like a mac screenshot pretty sure that's an apple font right there that's hilarious because this is intel back during these days intel didn't have anything to do with max in fact intel wouldn't have anything to do with max for another like 10 years we have sealed vhs tapes the journey inside the computer second edition okay so from what i understand there have been three editions of this kit the first edition which i think came out in 1994 this one which was 1996 and then there was one from 1998. so in this one we follow tim an inquisitive 12 year old on a quest to learn more about how computers and microprocessors work learn the major components of the computer enter a microprocessor see how a transistor works and visit the ultra clean fab where chips are made i think we've already done that but you know this would have been pretty cool too i think in case it wasn't obvious by now this is actually like a teacher's resource a school would have bought this for a teacher to set up in their classroom and well i mean movie day uh but also i have this great big teacher's guide and this is thick like uh like real thick there's a lot of stuff in here and most of it's like lesson plans but we do have this here note dear educator welcome to the journey inside the computer this national education program from intel corporation is designed to increase technology literacy among middle school students and inspire them to learn more about the science behind computers we hope both you and your students enjoy the kit and we look forward to receiving your input once you have used it in your classroom uh barbara a carmen i'm not sure maybe maybe she still works there and this would be a quick start guide on how to lay out your course as a teacher very cool i guess i mean i'm not a teacher so i'm not laying out a course although maybe i can get linus in here and i can teach him a thing or two about computers from the 90s that's not all there is to the teacher's guide though back here at the end we have laminates i don't think many people will have seen these uh in recent years but basically these are transparent slides that are shot like you put them over a light that reflects off a mirror and it pretty much just projects this onto a screen it's like a projector but not in a way i'm struggling to describe it because it's not something that i've ever had to describe before because it was just a thing but as far as i know this has fallen out of favor ha the intel pentium processor don't forget the trademark that's the anatomy of the pentium they got the fetch they got the decode they got the execute three main functions of the processor if this feels like a bit of a short circuit it almost is but there's more to this trust me we have the chip kit the chip kit is dare i say exactly what it sounds like if we open this up we have an intel cpu of some description with a little rubber band thing in it intel ipp that's literally all the markings there are in this thing some kind of serial number if i flip this over nothing uh they actually say here that the microprocessor and chips in this kit are non-working items and should not be installed into any computer for any reason this husk of a machine is actually one of the things that we were collecting for our ms-dos gaming pc build so if you want to see that let line us know because i've been hoping to do that for many years but what we have here is a pentium 120 cpu now i know for a fact that this cpu works because i had it booted just a couple of hours ago it turns on it beeps once very short and shows you an output on the display so i want to see if this other cpu even beeps because presumably this is just a i don't know like a mechanical sample like this doesn't seem to even have any kind of well it has no markings on it whatsoever so i'm very curious to see what happens if i put this in that's in there power supply is on no we would heard it beat by now well was worth a shot i mean what would they do just like give a classroom a perfectly good pentium okay the chip's a bust but that's not all it's in the chip kit if we look in here we also have switches as we can see here we have c cell batteries long life battery number 152 1.5 volts well i wonder what the voltage is now wait it's still like 1.45 volts so 1.46 volts this is still good how is this still good look at it aside from terrible batteries that may or may not actually still hold the charge we've got a silicon die i've never touched one of these with my bare hands before i'm not gonna lie like that looks really cool even though this is 90s tech in fact perhaps because this is 90s tech and everything looks so big like on a modern die you can't really make out much but i can see the structures with my naked eye it's fascinating we have some leds and these are supposedly 14 volt leds that's what they say and we also have these incandescent bulbs these are 12 volt bulbs and i'm i'm not sure what these would be used for that the leds wouldn't be used for oh it's a wild linus what are we looking at this is the chip kit those batteries are old whoa these are going to be leaky boys yeah long life battery not long enough fun fact though it's 1.5 volts it's measuring at 1.45 really yeah it still has a charge from 1996 yeah i doubt it would actually like power much for very long yeah it still has the voltage i will absorb your power into my body i wouldn't have done that there was a little bit of power one thing that uh older technology actually kind of is interesting for is how you can see it yeah the naked eye you can actually make out the structure of the chip yeah well that's just incredible isn't it it's it's amazing like this is the kind of thing that you don't see anymore like even with like a standard dye to the naked eye all you see is like the the iridescent it's a mirror it's just the mirror yeah this chip is the size of a dime it has over 3.1 million transistors and they're laminates oh shut up you can throw this on your overhead projector yeah i had to like actually explain because i i realized that people probably don't know what overhead projectors are anymore yeah so i had to explain what these were for you could you could write on them you could use your wet erase markers to mark them up and then wipe them off clean and they would go back in your little nice little separated binder here oh wow this is a whole giant thing oh yeah this is a class sorry i didn't even know what this was yeah this is a class so the introductory level will be like lower middle school then there's intermediate and then there's advanced you know what's really wild this this is far far more detailed than anyone is learning about microprocessors in school today i can't believe intel produced these resources i can't believe that my school never used them yeah if my school had this like a lot like if you look at the the teacher's guide video which we're not going to do we have another vhs to watch uh because it is movie day they actually show activities of how like having kids getting up and like okay so you're you're bits and you need to like turn on and off in order to send a signal and we need to read what this what this binary this ascii character is yeah that you're sending because there's actual like ascii tables and stuff in here for people to look at we all carry computers in our pockets and all it took was this class from intel for us to have a basic understanding of how they work you want to know something amazing they actually predict that in this really they're issued a portable personal computer it is light rugged and about the size of a textbook wow chromebooks are in this tome of future knowledge yeah how wild is that students are expected to carry their computers with them so they can use them at home and in all of their classes future middle school is completely networked the network is wireless holy wi-fi didn't exist when this came out did it when was 802.11b i was in high school yeah i don't think wi-fi was a thing they can communicate with each other students around the world portable computers are quite powerful they are multi-media machines tech sound graphics and video i mean they got steam on chromebooks now yeah all the students are given instructions and their computers all teachers know how to use computers computers are everyday tools see you guys are you guys are reading this going well yeah duh this is not duh back when this was written this was kind of wild yeah what's this yeah like this was futurism like this was oh computers are going to be common like right now we have computer labs maybe each classroom has a computer maybe if you're if you're really lucky like the wealthy families have computers i feel like like my grandparents talking about one-room schools at this point i didn't have internet yeah no i didn't not at this time my first interaction with the internet was on a school computer and it was dog slow this section future middle school is wild how accurate it is how absolutely on point nailed it like yeah if i didn't know that this was a genuine relic of another era i'd go oh this is a quaint marketing exercise where they're pretending to be from a past time predicting the exact state of things today this is super cool like i i want to i want to do this with my kids they would they would know so much more than their peers about circumcision programs they're not talking about like oh well this is the intel pentium way of doing things they're talking about at a very like high level like we're actually low level what electronics engineering what computers are okay well i have to run back to do lan show but this was fun oh well i guess we'll have to watch the vhs without you there's more of that stuff in here too like that oh well obviously that's what computers are things that you know people take for granted now but no many people own a vcr but do not know how to record a tv program they are not getting the full value out of their machine vcr what's that like we're in a different era now and they talk about things like computers and programmability in in terms that people like could understand at that time because this was all new like computers have been around but they weren't ever present you know like most people hadn't used a computer or had only briefly used a computer at this point in time so saying things like oh well word processors are like using typewriters that you can go back and change fix mistakes with ah it's it's so interesting to me looking back at this and seeing the difference between how things were presented to me as a kid because this is mostly contemporary with me but not quite i probably would have gotten this if i were if i had it at my school just because my school was usually a couple of years behind it just blows me away how is it that we've gotten to a point where i mean i had to explain what an overhead projector was did i had to explain what an overhead projector was i'm starting to worry now like what what what is time what even is time no good thing i got this indoor hoodie on from ltdstore.com keeps me nice and calm in times like these and now it's time to close our journey inside the computer not that we've even remotely gotten through all of this content because now it's time to watch a movie oh one more thing check it out the inside of the box is the inside of a pc from the era how cool is that that is some 90s ass cg i love it [Music] there's that intel branding [Music] how many intel logos could you spot in that journey inside the computer this series focuses on computers how they work and the impact they're having on our lives imagine that you had a machine that could take you on a journey to learn about computers just step through the machine and you could zoom down imagine you had a computer that you could use to learn about computers all he has to do is ask a question step through the machine and it sends him to places where he finds the answers cool i'm on a motherboard we all need to learn more about computers how do computers do what they do okay here we go how do computers work [Applause] great what am i supposed to do now go down the aisle to the fourth desk on the left you can talk of course i can special effects don't nobody cares no it's just well i mean i'm surprised that's all come on now get moving the person you want is in the third cubicle on the left third cubicle on the left didn't it say fourth wait a minute here you said it was the fourth oh sorry it's my fuzzy logic acting up again fuzzy logic oh that got grim hey wait where are you stop it's all right tim we're just gonna do a little surgery to see how a computer works but wait wait wait a minute here i i'm not a computer i've got a brain i'm afraid i don't really have a whole lot to add to this this this is just straight up information i was expecting more of the uh the cg stuff but i guess that was pretty high budget back then i wonder what intel employees they dragged out for this well that's enough of that for now i'm a little disappointed but at the same time i'm also quite amused so i'm not sure if i would call that a win or a loss it just is and sometimes that's okay well this was an interesting way for me to feel old when i was in school at the time that this was released our library was pretty much entirely analog you wrote down what you signed out and it was on an index card and you had to find things manually uh in fact i entered in a bunch of the information that eventually changed it into a digital system in my school it's a strange feeling knowing that kids today will never experience that what intel is put together here was surprisingly accurate for what it is like they predicted a lot of things about the schools of the future and it's even kind of fun you've got your group activities you've got electronics and you've even got a cheesy 90s education quality video if i'd gone through this unit as a kid i probably would have loved it for how hands-on it was even if i weren't a giant nerd it is however also an artifact of a time when intel was on top amd had just released the k5 by that time and if that name doesn't sound familiar it's because it didn't really succeed so in a way it also comes across as a little patronizing especially given their legal maneuvers around that time still this kit's just really cool and if you look at the teacher's guide the people who put it together were really passionate about teaching and about tech it kind of makes me wish i were a kid again and that i could
