now you can shop with confidence now let's get back to the video folks we did not need to wait very long for the drama of game four to commence dingley Ren began with D4 dangly ran has played D4 most of his entire life Yan yuponushi plays Knight F6 and E6 now if I would have to guess 99 of you watching this video were not really into chess as much as you are now three to four years ago what you don't know is that dingly Ren excuse me you promised she used to only play G6 and used to play the grunfeld defense it's one of the most renowned openings in chess it's very complicated it's uh it takes a lifetime to master and just for his match against Magnus Carlson he learned e65 I mean learn e6d5 of course all the best players in the world know this stuff but in this game this is what was expected and here came the drama now you might say I don't what are you talking about like how how can there be drama on move four right ding is either going to play the traditional Queen's Gambit okay what did he take did he play E3 I don't know ding loves the Catalan okay and the thing is when you are predictable with white it doesn't really matter when you're predictable with black it it matters more because you go second if you if people know you play the Catalan it it's like it's like knowing you're going to play LeBron James like okay so you know you're gonna play LeBron James and you know what he's gonna do he's still gonna put up dirty like if he wants you know you just gotta try to slow him down ding didn't play the Catalan ding didn't play the traditional Queen's Knight in this position dingly Wren played the move H3 what now to the some of you might watch this and go so what I play H3 all the time yeah but you're 400. all right the move H3 has literally never happened in a master's database never now why well it looks like a waste of a move I mean it looks like okay one of the ideas could be white playing G4 another idea could be to block this but black can't even do that so what is the point of H3 the point of H3 is I think to basically grab Beyond by his shirt and throw them both off a cliff together holding on to each other all right like let's go and obviously there are a few ways that black and play Black can keep the center closed and try to play a Queen's Gambit decline Style uh black can try to play you know C5 to uh taraj Style uh young takes you'll notice Jan spent 10 minutes on move four look at Jan's time D takes C4 all right that so now we have a Queen's Gambit accepted now it's essentially like we got to this position but the capture on C4 occurred so we have H3 DC4 and just the regular Queen's Gambit declined you know C5 Bishop C4 and now A6 the fascinating thing about this position all right let me just go back to the beginning I know that this did not happen bear with me but folks look at this position right and then look at this position I mean it's just basically like white play date why is that there well like that that's that's what we're trying to figure out okay um castles Knight C6 but Jana's doing everything right and we have Knight C3 I mean nothing too spectacular here right obviously nothing why are certain things happening well here's how black has to handle this position you'll notice that Jana's down uh a lot on time um the other thing is okay here's why this opening is important if the Queen's Gambit accepted is not in Jan's repertoire he's not really happy to be playing it what what does that mean right well Jan is playing a nimso Indian setup if young wanted to play the Queen's Gambit declined excuse me accepted accepted he would have played the Queen's gamut accepted that's how you play the Queen's Gambit accepted but you don't really play the Queen's gamut accepted like this it's just not something that you're really interested in but Yan as you'll see is trying to fight back he is not trying to play Bishop E7 he's not trying to play castles none of this stuff um and digging is trying to keep the tension here among the center bonds one of the major ideas in the white position is if black tries to fight back too quickly white has Queen F3 and white can get some very very serious activity with the move D5 so White's major Pawn break in the position is trying to succeed in playing the move D5 so we have B5 we have Bishop D3 Bishop B7 and now kind of the first major tense moment in the opening as dingly Ren has achieved a 20 minute time Advantage by the ninth move um he can play Queen E2 Rook D1 he can try to play for e45 he can try to play for E4 D5 but no he plays A4 virtually instantly he plays the move A4 immediately punishing Yan for overextending with this Pawn we go all the way back here this was all something dingly Wren had anticipated he knew Yan might play B5 and it very well could be the best move but now he's gonna ask Yan what he's going to do with that pawn on B5 and I got news for you Jan ain't got a whole lot he could do with that pawn on B5 other than push it his alternative is maybe going here all right so Jan after some thought 10 minutes plays B4 he's now down 30 minutes on the clock in the opening this is why we give them the two hours for the first 40 moves and this is why we give Gotham an iced coffee in the morning otherwise he's cranky uh and now with allergy season oh my God my whole face is Puffy it's ridiculous so B4 and now we have Knight to E4 inviting an exchange of knights if Knight takes Bishop takes the bishop applies some very meaningful pressure and if black tries to play the move F5 that's a gross overreaction because actually I will take and I I like to say don't trade Bishops for Knights unless there's a good reason there is a good reason you secure a beautiful Square in the center of the board you have Queen H5 these pawns are weak the squares are weak black is severely overextended so Jan in this position actually finds a critical move Knight A5 Jan is down 32 minutes on the clock but he's so good that it doesn't matter that dingley Ren comes with engine preparation okay dingley Wren has shown up to this game clearly using a fantastic prep that he has studied for months and yet Jan has avoided all the horrible stuff and found himself in a position where after the move Knight A5 he is targeting ding's Knight and he's basically saying ding you got to take my Pawn he's giving ding upon his idea is Knight C5 Bishop C5 DC I'll figure it out I don't know how he's planning to figure that out maybe he's gonna castle and play Queen C7 and bring his Rooks um maybe he's gonna play Bishop before takes you know he's going to trade Queens 94 and get the pawn back like this then the pun might sneak this way but I guess it gets taken I don't know but he plays the move Knight A5 and clearly clearly Jan has a lot of things prepared to meet the move Knight takes C5 he is just giving up upon this is a very common Concept in chess first of all Jan is trying to play the best moves but second of all he's trying to get out of his opponent's prep right that's what he's trying to do so it's very brave of him to play Knight A5 because it very much is a move that a person can be stuck in their prep and dingo's here and if you're Keen look at the time folks when a person thinks for 34 minutes they do not remember their prep anymore so Jan despite falling for every single one of the nuances in ding's preparation finds a way out plays the move Knight A5 offering up a pawn for activity and ding does not take ding decides the move is not Knight takes C5 and instead is Knight takes F6 for what I can only imagine he had prepared Queen F6 he was probably gonna play E4 and try to activate his pieces and hit the queen and G takes F6 which is exactly what Jan played in the game now people were hesitating they were like you really want to do this now some of you might be shocked some of you might go why would Jan take with the pawn what about his Pawn structure right where's his King going well this is the single reason you would take with the g-pawn when your opponent has already committed their King somewhere in a chess game you now have a green light you you can just you see where you can attack in some cases it's stupid to attack but in this case it's not stupid these pawns do a really nice job completely covering four infiltration spots H5 is weak sure but black is gonna move his Queen and then he's gonna Castle along and I got news for you somehow these pawns do a nice job how do you ensure in this position guarantee in this position black has difficulties castling you take on C5 you don't even think about it you take on C5 why because if black takes back on C5 the C file is open all right white can play E4 Queen E2 Bishop F4 Rook C1 and it's a fight black is gonna fight white is gonna fight I mean it's a very very messy position but after the move G takes F6 you have to play D take C5 in order to open the position because if you don't play the move D takes C5 uh then black is gonna play C4 and when the king side is sealed and shut the black king will be escorted this way and uh folks you might not be fully aware of this but when you Castle on opposite sides you just destroy one another I mean that's just what you do right so ding has to go here ding doesn't do that Ding plays the second best move but it's in extremely provocative move why is it extremely provocative because Jan's gonna go here and now folks the ring is shut the cage is closed the fighters are gonna fight I mean that's it all right like lock these two men in a room give them some four ounce gloves no shirts on by the way that Pereira knockout oh my goodness oh that was I ran around oh my God I'm still thinking about it um folks someone's gonna lose this game someone's gonna lose Bishop C2 back Yan plays Queen C7 exactly what he's supposed to do the seal has been shut he's gonna Castle long he's gonna play Bishop D6 yeah and and ding is going to play Bishop E3 maybe D5 or E5 maybe B3 and try to smash through because he knows that Young's King is going this way that's it both guys are just headed for a collision course that's what's gonna happen all right so Bishop D2 played by ding obviously lining up the bishop to hit this Pawn Jan plays Rook G8 right both guys are just preparing the Cannons I mean this this is pretty wild right it's like a movie moment now here I think ding should play Queen E1 uh Frankly Speaking I'm not really sure why he didn't play Queenie one uh probably he didn't like something to do with you know the pressure over here um but he can always sidestep from the pin so that the pawn is now able to capture see the problem in White's position is that if he plays here Bishop F3 is always an issue because he's pinned but if the Kings on H1 there is no issue but yeah Queen E1 you'll notice ding spends five minutes he plays Rook C1 but still the last few moves is just it's just the preparation Bishop D2 Rook G8 Rook both guys just bringing other pieces now we have long castles and uh with one hour on the clock each both players have basically reached the moment after uh both players have made 16 moves this is the most tense moment in the in the game most tense moment it's official Jan has Castle he is almost completely out of improving moves what I mean by that is both players have made their necessary preparations for the battle now white can play King H1 to get off the G file white can play Queen E1 again Queenie one is always looking to me very very natural uh and then obviously if the queen like defends the pawn you have Bishop D3 applying some pressure so it's kind of like a move order thing like do I play Queen E1 do I play Bishop D3 do I play King H1 after some thought dingley Wren plays Bishop D3 now Vladimir kramnik very very strong player a legend one I I remember he had a quote that basically was like if you spend more than 10 or 15 minutes on a move it's gonna be a bad move unless uh of course I don't know you're stalling so you'll notice that Ding plays Bishop D3 right at that 15 minute mark and it's the wrong move order it's he he chose the wrong move order okay what does that mean well I just showed you right like there's Queenie one to attack this first and then Bishop D3 He just chooses Bishop D3 why is that the wrong move order well in the game Jan unpins himself now if you play Queen E1 attacking this I no longer have to defend my B4 Pawn which is fascinating why do I no longer have to defend because I can start firing away you cannot take on B4 because you there's nothing here I come back and I start attacking you you had to start with Queen E1 because if I played F5 after Queen E1 in this case it's still a balanced game alright you haven't actually committed your Bishop to be captured but the way ding did this the bishop can't be taken because of the pin but the bishop is always hanging so ding plays Bishop D3 and then is going to do something but one of the two pieces is no longer pinned rookie one and in this position Yandy pomonishi delivered a brutal body shot left uppercut to the body F5 and suddenly the Integrity of the white position was questioned this hits this this hits this this hits this and you never managed to make it through my queen side and after a long thought ding went back we go back here one hour each per player ding plays Bishop D3 and brings the bishop back to C2 and he has lost 36 minutes of time I think if you are keenly watching this you might know where this is going now brings his a knight back to C6 that Knight did its job in fact I would argue that night move was the most important he made in the entire game why because it was the first move that made ding think and in that moment ding went inaccurate he had to take on C5 taking the pawn and hoping for the best but instead of that he took on F6 and opened up the position for a man in Yani pomnishi who loves a dynamic game and now the Knight has come back home instead of Defending ding plays Bishop G5 and listen folks no good game is finished without sacrificing The Rock Rook takes G5 a beautiful move unnecessary black can play Bishop E7 but Rook takes G5 in the words of Jorge Cambridge Vidal super necessary Rook takes G5 Knight takes G excuse me Knight takes G5 Knight takes Z4 and Yani pomnishi follows the age-old philosophy of an attack does not need to end in mate he has two powerful Bishops this Pawn will break through and become a passer the Bishops still can create an attack ding plays Queen H5 attacking pawns on F7 now a beautiful move F6 you can Venture into my position but you will probably be trapped Knight F3 I grabbed the bishop and I grab the pawn and the position is officially materially equal but black has a completely decisive advantage and a 30 minute Edge on the clock why is it so winning because you don't trade Bishops because Bishop H2 is always a problem white goes here dingley Wren has two minutes to make his remaining 14 moves Jan plays C3 and C2 the pawn is now a square away from queening and a permanent headache and now Jan ends it all with the top computer move E5 why is this the top computer move because the Rook is trapped it cannot go here or here or here and if it goes here it blocks the queen and black goes here 29 moves a 30 minute Edge at the end of the game after being down 30 minutes wins game two of the World Chess Championship 2023 it is his second win in uh so excuse me it's his first win in the world in a world championship match he hasn't actually won a game yet in the world championship he didn't win against Magnus he leads one and a half to half this game was a beautiful one ding shows up clearly making his opponent uncomfortable I'm I'm imagining ding was inspired by the person he's working with Richard report many of you don't know or care about any of that many of you don't even care about this world championship did you know that game one's recap got outperformed by 600 ELO chess crazy no Magnus no views ding surprises his opponent and yany pomnishi plays a nearly perfect opening sacrificing upon for activity which ding for forgets doesn't remember the extent of his preparation goes wrong and Jan just starts firing away with F5 a breathtaking game now folks before you click off and I'll let you go about your day as Jan takes a one and a half uh half lead here in the world championship a friendly reminder all courses 50 off all right during uh the first few days here of the World Chess Championship and uh Chesley
