while no one is seriously calling the steam deck a perfect console you can't deny that it's been a pretty big hit since it released in early 2022 but here is the elephant in the room the steam deck is really a miniature PC it's just crammed into a chassis with joysticks and runs Steam OS instead of Windows and it's no secret that PC Hardware ages in the minds of Gamers much more quickly than consoles do the typical console has a lifespan of around five years give or take a year or so but PC Gamers tend to upgrade their Hardware every two years or at least this was the case before the pandemic so despite the current excitement around the steam deck does the fact that it's really a PC Doom it to a disappointingly short lifespan it's like this when you go and buy a console game you know that the game should run properly in that console unless the developer royally screwed up somewhere even if the console isn't as powerful as a current gen PC and the graphics look a bit dated after a few years you can still be confident that any title worth of salt is still going to run as intended or mostly free of bugs because these games are supposed to be written specifically for that console or at least get ported over and tested before release but the steam deck is primarily built to run PC games off of the steam store and due to the virtually infinite Hardware software combinations that can exist on any given PC there is much more variation in how well a given PC game will run meaning there's no guarantee that the steam deck will be able to smoothly run new titles a few years down the road however the steam deck does have a few tricks up its sleeve to give it more longevity than you might have thought we'll tell you what those are right after we thank hitsner for

headster by clicking on the link below the steam deck is designed primarily to be an on-the-go system instead of a true hybrid console like the switch it can get away with having a screen with a resolution of only 1280x800 the display is only seven inches diagonally so while it's not quite a retina display if you hold it like a foot away from your eyes it's still pretty close and why am I talking about this the relatively low resolution means that the GPU doesn't have to push too many pixels a good thing as the jmd GPU inside only has about 1.6 teraflops of raw power might sound like a lot but it's roughly the same as a GTX 950. right now some notably demanding AAA titles run on the steam deck at around 40 frames per second at medium settings at 800p but that doesn't mean you should just dismiss the steam deck as an already outdated piece of Hardware that's only as powerful as a seven-year-old graphics card the GPU inside the steam deck uses amd's rdna2 architecture which supports modern features like Fidelity FX super resolution allowing smart upscaling that increases the frame rate and battery life it can even do ray tracing and although it most of the time only works when you dual boot with Windows there's a good chance that Ray tracing will get more official support making the steam deck even more compelling additionally expandable nvme storage is available and the steam deck itself comes with 16 gigs of RAM built in enough for virtually any game out there right now especially if you're running in that lower steam deck friendly settings now with all that being said it still lacks the power of most gaming laptops but it's not trying to be a gaming laptop although it's targeting a slightly different crowd than Nintendo's switch there's a lesson to be learned from the switch that console has been going strong for nearly six years with much less powerful hardware and older too because it was built to provide a specific kind of experience that wasn't centered around having the very best graphics available similarly with the steam deck valve understood that while people would certainly want to play the latest and greatest titles on it there is also a massive library of games on Steam that are still very popular despite being significantly less demanding and being able to play that huge library on the go is why the steam deck is Fists not to give you the same experience as your desktop Battlestation 6900 that you have at home of course the current iteration of the steam deck will be outdated one day we're just saying that it most likely isn't going to just die a premature death especially as valve continues to work on its proton compatibility layer in order to make more of Steam games play nicely with the steam deck remember that the Steam OS that it runs on is Linux based valve is also all but confirmed that there will be new versions of the steam deck in the future for when the current Hardware just gets along in the tooth it's just worth remembering that not every gamer is chasing the most realistic hair physics possible pleasing as they may be thanks for watching guys like dislike check out some of our other videos come up with
