guys ice poseidon has now issued a statement that he's innocent that's right he never scammed people and i got it wrong yeah that audio of him admitting everything it's a deep fake maybe maybe his haters created it i don't know either way in his new statement he's not going to return the money but it's not a scam it's he's innocent now i'm going to warn you guys you have to have a very very high iq for this so if you're not the leader of your mensa club you click off this video you you don't belong here okay very high iqs big brains only i just want to say this up front to be fair to ice poseidon one possibility i did consider is that he might suffer from extreme memory loss and just maybe just forgot about his confession a few days ago that's the only explanation i have for what we're about to uh hear here but here's the statement right here my one and only response to the subject and then underneath his one and only response he responded again the post has a lot of terminology and might be hard to grasp if you're a noob to crypto but everything is verifiable and i encourage people to go check for themselves that's right ladies and gentlemen it might be a little hard to understand and if you still think it's a scam at the end of this twitlonger you probably don't understand krypto okay this is how it works his liquidity pool pre-sell for coin wallet allowed him to take your money if you don't understand that you're not educated but he says i did not steal or scam anyone nor did i make money at the expense of others now this is very interesting very interesting point ice poseidon seems to be arguing for the existence of magical money that a comes from from nowhere because he admits in the twitlonger he did make three hundred thousand dollars but it wasn't at the expense of anyone apparently thin air i think is basically his argument first of all i did not advertise cxcoin to my casual fans who don't know anything about crypto guys it's okay he didn't advertise to the casual fans he only did to the die-hard fans the die-hard fans can get scammed guys it's not except whoops it took me like two seconds of looking into this and i realized oh yeah he did scam his casual fans too now we have to forgive ice because remember you know his whole memory loss thing it's very tough for him to remember what he did like three days ago and even harder for him to remember what he did in october he tweeted about an nft project to his whole audience on twitter he was pitching an nft and shortly after he pitched it well it rugged the project took all the money and ran ice poseidon tells his casual fans looks like they deleted their socials and didn't hand out the mints this is after people bought that's really unfortunate and i'm sorry to anyone who looked into these guys on based on his recommendation the crypto market is dangerous and i feel pretty stupid now for promoting this now look i think the answer here is obvious i think i could have forgiven this if he only scammed his die hard fans but the fact that his casual fans were involved unforgivable and also he forgot to say that this was an ad and that he got paid for this which he told me behind the scenes when i asked about this but he said he didn't say that because he figured it was obvious the same way he figured it was obvious that this coin was going to be a scam even though he said it was a long-term project um it's very complicated guys very hard to understand you know what i mean big iqs only and the next part of the twit longer is the same on the whole video there was not one single mention of the main product which has been fully functional for months easy tip four dot me i had even used this on uh some of the streams all this was built from scratch once again guys all i can do is apologize for my carelessness here and tell you that i did try to use this train wreck before i made my videos gonna planning on becoming a full-time twitch streamer with this revolutionary new crypto website that allows you to send money from one person to the other over the internet yeah um breaking news but unfortunately the website wasn't working at the time yeah when you try to click register on easy tip for me it says contact us on our official telegram which ice poseidon admits was dead so the dead website requires you to contact a dead telegram to get it to work this fully functional fully functional thing and even in the videos that i found where it was functional it wasn't functioning properly people were tipping like pennies and making it seem like they tipped millions of dollars and even ice poseidon seemed to realize like how bad his platform was at the time yes gary that was you what nah see now now there's a glitch the 2000 is probably a glitch too then he's probably that's pr is it it's bro it says 50 million so i don't know if i thought it would be better if i talked more about this dumpster fire platform which doesn't work but there you go that's that's what's going on there now we're about to hit the crypto jargon section of this twit longer and i just want to prepare you because i read this thing many times guys you guys know i'm a crypto head so i was trying to understand what he was saying and you know what i realized you can translate all of the jargon all of everything he says into basically one sentence over and over repeated which is i'm keeping the money like take this for example it was completely unnecessary to have 400 thousand dollars in the lp 264 in the lp 150k in the buyback function and the money was at risk at getting the value due to the crypto markets dropping so you could try to understand that why it's unnecessary for his fans to have 400 000 why they don't need it or you could just replace it with i'm keeping the money it just reads so much better that way look the whole thing actually reads better i'm keeping the money i'm keeping the money i'm keeping the money i'm keeping the money see it doesn't the idea gets across so much better now another amazing part about this too is the idea that he says right there which is that he has to take out the money because the crypto markets are dropping but when i asked ice poseidon where he was going to put the money that he took out of the crypto markets he told me he's going to put it in the crypto markets uh invest into crypto ethereum mainly see it's so obvious guys if you just have a big brain you have to have a high iq remember he had to take the money out of the crypto markets because that's a terrible investment and the real place to put the money is in the crypto markets because that's where the big money's at now the last thing he says is that uh i hope these points clarify some of the misunderstandings and justify my actions at all times i will be keeping the money i'm i'm sorry i will guarantee every cx coin holder is able to sell their tokens if they wish to you know the crazy thing to me is this whole twit longer thing could have been avoided this whole situation could have been avoided just by giving the money back to investors like that's what's crazy to me you didn't have to do you know russian gold medal mental gymnastics to get out of this thing you could have just given the money back instead it's like well the lp and the markets were crashing and oh i was getting out of it no no you were just scamming people that's which is i guess if that's what you want to do what you're you're into but uh i think he's at this point taking away the last admirable quality about himself with this latest twit longer which is that the the first time he talked to me at least he was honest at least he was an honest scammer you could say that about ice poseidon and now he's he's just a regular scammer
