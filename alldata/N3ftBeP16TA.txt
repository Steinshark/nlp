four million dollars was stolen from these podcasters and I decided to investigate I found the man responsible but before we confront him let's go back to where it all started when Theo Von a comedian released this our podcast was defrauded we were stolen from uh the company that did it as cast media and the man that did it is Colin Thompson in total I've just between talking with folks there's up to four million dollars that I know of uh we're in the six figures I know of podcasts are in the seven figures now when I saw this I had same two questions on my mind as you do one who is Colin Thompson and two y'all are making six to seven figures doing podcasts I'm in the wrong line of work I make like four figures here in the 10 million dollar Studio barely keep the lights on okay so I went to do some research figure out you know how these people are making all this money and also how they got robbed and what I found out was that this company that stole the four million dollars was a podcast Network called cast media podcast Network being a fancy name for saying they represent podcasts to find sponsors you know all that stuff you violently skip with the fast forward 15 second button yeah those guys and cast media would basically work with them as a middleman they would take some money give the podcasters the read and then give the money of course taking a cut for themselves now that is simplifying it a bit and we'll go into the details more later but what you need to know is that cast media hadn't been paying their talent on time and what started as being late for maybe a month had turned into seven eight nine months late on paying until one day cast media and their CEO Colin Thompson says hey we're probably gonna go into bankruptcy which means you get nothing unless you take a special deal with another podcast Network called podcast one now who's podcast one well it's an even bigger Network and they basically say hey we'll acquire you pay off what you're owed if you sign a new deal with new terms with us if you do you'll get back some of the money you owed now some of the money you owed over two years and you'll also get stock in our company but what stock well podcast Network stock a company that wasn't public yet but as of this video now is and is down almost 50 percent now if you took that stock in two years you could sell it how much it's worth at that point is dubious Now podcast one would say they were just trying to help it wasn't their debt so it's a great deal now the more cynical view of this is that it's kind of strong arming creators you either take the deal or you'll never get what you're paid I mean podcasters like Jim cornette were literally told in the event that cast is unable to close the podcast one asset sale it will likely declare bankruptcy so take the deal or lose everything you're owed and to make things stranger podcast one was paying cast media in stock for every podcaster that took the deal so if you agreed and wanted the money you were owed you're kind of bailing out the company that got you into this mess so obviously some people didn't like that deal although I'm understandably others did and took the deal and look I'm not here to litigate whether those podcast One deals are good or bad frankly it's not the point of this video all cleanups are gonna be messy what I did want to know though is how did that four million dollars go missing in the first place and to try to find out I began to reach out to everyone starting with Colin Thompson to ask for his side of the story you're being accused of basically stealing four million dollars your clients say you defrauded them what's your side of the story yeah I appreciate you reaching out you know um I wanted to talk with you because I I appreciate the work that you do um I appreciate that your journalistic integrity and I know that you're gonna tell a fair Story cast is sort of the dream of of the vision of Independence you know Free Speech not bound by sort of corporate Norms um the ability and the background backbone to support Visionary talented unique independent voices people like Theo Von um you know cast perspective was Independence is the product there were plenty of times where you know we believed in a show uh he ran into trouble maybe it was canceled in one way or another and canceled quote-unquote and and we stood by our creators right continue to support them through that time you know when maybe more corporate organization wouldn't we we wedded the storm together um we believe truly that that's what you know was unique and special about cast and my heart and soul is still into that Vision I'm a musician originally um and I got into this because I wanted to support shows that were bucketing the trend going against the grain but unique and important to the broader dialogue um but where's the where's the four million I mean I mean yeah I hear you I hear you every everybody's got a Grand Vision but the Grand Vision when it you know when we get to this point everyone wants to know where the money is not what the vision is sure you know we built an infrastructure a cast that I wasn't in tremendously proud of I believe that over the years we generated better revenue for creators um paid them out more than other podcasts would necessarily be able to because we invested heavily in infrastructure took an individualized approach anecdotally um you know we but you're saying we pay out more but I I mean I mean clearly that's you know kind of not true right wait wait but you asked for my story do you mind if I I just just tell just tell the story you know we're getting to the financial difficulties sure sure um you know uh our vision it really worked creators benefited made made a lot more money than than they would have um uh and many creators are you know do have more money in their pocket now because of that however During the period from February 2022 until February 2023 our unit economics changed drastically our Revenue per download which is an important metric for analyzing sales performance you know free from content performance considerations dropped by 58 percent in other words over the course of those 12 months the revenue that we could generate on one download um moved down by 58 you know okay that took three minutes to get to a real answer and I've got to be honest this whole conversation was about that painful talking to somebody who owes creators millions and he's telling you how he got them paid so much money is a little frustrating but setting that aside the central claim of Colin is that all of this happened because revenues dropped in 2022 and he just couldn't pay people on time but as I spoke to people about Colin I realized late payments weren't a new thing at all people told me that was always the case okay you joined them in 2018 2018 yeah so when did you start getting late payments basically like they didn't come when they said they were going to come and when did you stop getting full payments I can answer that right away that was right before from the first check we were supposed to get it didn't arrive when he said it was never on time it wasn't unusual if it was like a month late a month and a half late and then when it goes from all right a month late to two months late to three months late and then I would say Hey where's this uh where's the deposit that go Yep they're trying to figure out man he says it's he has whatever investment coming you're gonna get this huge lumps of money so then that's didn't come then you're looking at you know now you look at four months like it was the money they nearly got six months like okay man where the hell is our money yes that's a huge problem of course up till 2023 money had slowly started coming in so people were letting it slide but as these balances built up over time eventually brynden and Brian realized they were owed 400 Grand on the fighter and the kid and upwards of 1.6 million across all their shows now remember Brian is just informed about I'll find the kids you have to manage dick boy golden hours other shows that are owed money so Brian's like can you believe this I'm like yeah that 400 Grand is terrible no we're right wow 1.6 million what are we doing here now I should be clear Colin denies that there are these payment issues before 2022. your talent says they stopped getting paid as early as 2021 and they had issues and delays well before 2022. no I'm not I'm not aware of any difficulties um before you know the end of 2022 the beginning of 2023 then I talked to his business partner and everything changed he told me accounting was always a nightmare my name is Dustin canaus I was Colin's business partner as you would introduce me and the VP of production and creative development with gas media one of the things Colin said is he was not aware of any accounting issues you know early on um is that true did you guys hear from Talent about because I every tell and I talked to said they were constantly complaining about accounting yeah I mean everyone from uh from the beginning had complained about how long it took to get paid um the managers would constantly step in I think all of his accounting was done through Google Sheets basically and it was just him but he would never let me see everything he wouldn't actually let me see what was coming in and what was going out um and I was like well you know I kind of need to get a whole picture and he wouldn't he just wouldn't share it oh that is a red flag and it also lines up exactly with what I heard from a lot of the creators the accounting was always weird people had to chase it down and the numbers were a little screwy it led them to distrust what they were getting from Colin [Music] they owed us plus whatever we think they still kept going for after that date plus we don't know truly what the accounting is because stop the supplying account maybe at one point earlier in the year their accountant sent me two different sets of numbers on what money I was supposed to get so I don't trust their accounting I can't emphasize enough I heard this complaint over and over not just from Brian last everyone was worried about the accounting but a lot of people who spoke up were just anonymous because they were afraid of Collins suing them which isn't surprising because Colin warned Brian who started talking quote the ensuing damages if you were to cause this deal to unravel or within the region of 10 million to 20 million dollars consider this a serious caution it would lead to decisive legal action so basically he was threatening people and people are scared but I realized that these payment issues accounting issues they were all Clues sure but not the whole story to really understand how it could be that cast fell apart we need another piece of the puzzle which is minimum guarantees remember I told you earlier that I was simplifying podcast networks so let's go into the deeper waters the truth is these deals vary very wildly and some of the bigger podcasters demand something called a minimum guarantee where they aren't just paid a split of ads they're paid a guaranteed minimum every month and podcasters love this because it means they don't have to wait so long to get paid according to Colin though this is how he fell behind we had months in there where our gross profit margins were you know literally negative prior to any operating expenses because the minimum guarantees that made economic sense when we made the deal were just completely underwater basically he overpaid cast made deals to bring people on in the first place over promised and then couldn't pay even Colin's former business partner agreed with this although he thinks some of the money went to Colin personally as well we've got Colin's narrative as his business partner you look at the situation 4 million missing the big question on everyone's mind where did the money go that the money is gone gone one is he built a custom house he was known for going on big crazy vacations uh in you know he went to Hawaii multiple times in 2022 and was posting about it on social media um there's not there's not a question of was there money in in that sense uh to be able to buy land where a lot of celebrities go to to escape but aside from that the other thing that he has done is essentially make constants minimum guarantees to new talent to try to entice them to join cast media so saying you know I'll give you a one-year guaranteed 250 000 500 000 whatever guarantee is that I've heard that even um as soon as February of this year he was offering multi-million dollar minimum guarantees so oh at the same time or he claims his revenues are way down he's offering multi-million dollar minimum guarantees for talent yes you know his priority is trying to keep the new Talent Happy for a while um with essentially his whole goal of selling casts to make big money in the end um but yeah he I would say that honestly most of the money probably went to the minimum guarantees of other Talent uh instead of to the people that it was supposed to go to wow that might be the closest thing we have to a coherent answer on what happened to cast media Although our story doesn't stop there because obviously that's a pretty big accusation that some of the money may have gone to a house so I decided to look into that and found that Colin Thompson indeed bought a 1.7 million dollar house the same year as his financial troubles and I also found out that right about the time he was talking about declaring bankruptcy he moved that house into a trust where the trustee was a Wyoming LLC he set up which from Where I Stood looked a lot like hiding assets from a bankruptcy right before a bankruptcy but when I confronted Colin about this he said I had things completely backwards the truth is he was hiding his property for a totally different reason a very sympathetic reason we anonymized our address because we were getting threats in the last 30 days there was there's been you know I think you can see yeah I think you can see though how other people might see it another way where it looks like you're trying to Shield it by hiding it from a personal name into a trust owned by an LLC I mean I'm just I in a very favorable Space by where I live right I I assume you listen to the Jim cornette episodes where they specifically call out where I live we were really really concerned we were getting threats when I heard this I was pretty alarmed and I totally understood his fears so I went to go ahead and look for the episode where Jim cornette apparently specifically called out where he lived but it wasn't there actually Jim cornette never mentions a specific address but a general area but way more damning for Colin's story is the fact that that episode came out in July but Colin formed his LLC for moving the house in June before these threats ever happened he's creating this shell company so I found it very hard to believe I pointed this out to Colin and he said this quote they revealed General details and I anticipated the possibility of this happening Brian threatened it very specifically in my original email exchange with him back in May so I got a hold of those emails there was no threat in them instead Brian said things like consider this a serious caution we're gonna make sure to endlessly let all listeners know with great detail that Colin Thompson a podcast one stole our money because he doesn't know how to run a business which is sort of true this guy doesn't know how to run a business so I became increasingly convinced maybe just maybe Colin might be lying to me about why he hid his house in a trust with the Wyoming LLC trustee okay I know this is a bit inside baseball right now but it's important because I think it reveals intentions because I then looked up the website he used to create the LLC and the website tagline for Collins LLC is quote asset protection is our only focus so you know want to hide your house wrong company not their focus asset protection that's your guy I mean I'm not surprised but I'm surprised that he tried to say this wasn't the case so I sent a screenshot of that to Colin saying hey you're obviously hiding Assets in this company that specializes in asset protection planning uh where the other tagline by the way is creditors will be forced into a better settlement or to dismiss the case altogether and when I sent that to Colin he responded quote I can't speak to what's written as marketing material on a website I didn't write it come on bro we got you okay I can't go show up at an asset protection only store and say hey I was just looking for a little anonymity you know that's not being honest and look I don't know how dumb this guy thinks we are but in my opinion what happened is pretty simple I think Colin bought a 1.7 million dollar house the same year as he had trouble paying people I think his accounting was always sketchy I think he over promised people money to attract new talent and I think in the end he tried to sell it all to a bigger company and force these podcasters into raw deals and worst of all this is not a new story Colin is not unique actually the main reason I took this case is because we've all seen this story play out before sleazy business guy screws over artist or musician or podcaster look to be honest I wanted to find out how it happened but I also wanted to find out how we can learn to prevent it in the future because to be honest I'm as much in this media landscape as these guys and I think the answer starts with how you get involved how did Colin find and sign all these celebs well the truth is some people were introduced theovan was introduced by Brendan shop but I asked Brian and Brendan how they got involved and their answer struck me as part of the problem but was he just offering better deals than everyone else I don't know it's word of mouth it's because what happens is they go who is your agency we don't know the no nobody like we're not interacting with these people all the time what happens is it's like if there's an agency that this person is with and this person is with you know we go that do you make money yeah all right can you hook me up and then especially when Comics are talking like man this guy is killing it for us man I made 1.6 million this year like damn that's more than I made who you you think you would take me on then it becomes this like Snowball Effect and you know and then everybody's there yeah this is the issue and look it's not to absolve Colin it's not to put any blame on anyone who got screwed over here but the truth is people are always LED around with these dollar amounts oh you made this much you know that's how they get you in these bad contracts and then they don't pay you and you're left chasing a Wyoming LLC to nowhere so this isn't just about these podcasters it's everywhere it's about 360 deals in music mcns with YouTubers and just honestly business people begging you to let them control your money and then you getting scraps it's as disgusting as it is common and I really hope that any aspiring people in media learn from these mistakes and scams and realize you don't need these middleman people most of the time but more than that do not trust people with your business who promise you the world in fact usually that's the worst red flag oh you're gonna make all the money just sign here it's a trap and you never know what's in the fine print until you read it just ask Dylan danis foreign [Music]
