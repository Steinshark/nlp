there are so many in demand entry-level tech 
jobs that are coming onto the scene and in   today's video I'm going to share with you what 
these roles are what they are paying and what   skills are really required oh and also too 
what other courses you should be taking to get   these skills I did a lot of research for this 
video for the main reason of I am as you know   fascinated with what is coming up especially can 
you believe that 20124 is like 8 weeks away how   did that happen we need to be focusing on what do 
we want to be looking for in the new year when it   comes to our roles our careers and this will help 
guide you on the note of upskilling I want to say   a huge thank you to code academy who sponsored 
this video and even more so is giving back to   you they are offering listen closely here they 
are offering one month free of code academy Pro   for the first 300 people who use the link in my 
description so go sign up today because you need   to level up for 20124 we are taking our careers 
to the next level and by learning online through   the comfort of your home I mean I mean that's a 
win-win if you ask me all right let's get into it coming in at number 10 is web developer and 
this is a great place to start your career if   you are someone who is leaning to more of the 
technical side versus going into the product   management side or soft skill side I think this 
is such a great place to start your career because   it will teach you so much about the foundations 
when it comes to development that you can then   take it and go in so many different directions 
whether it be software engineering whether it   be more a front end or uiux design it really 
can help you set that Foundation to Branch off   into different directions now I always refer to 
levels FYI for compensation and it's because it   is accurate what it does is it actually surveys 
people from different companies and then double   checks that as to what you should expect now this 
is the median compensation so this is isn't just   for juniors this is the middle ground and we're 
not talking about location here because you are   located everywhere throughout the world but it 
does give you a sense as to what you can expect   now the medium is median that's such a hard word 
to say by the way is 148,000 us obviously when you   are starting out in a junior role this is not what 
you will be getting but it is a great indicator as   to what you can work towards coming in at number 
nine is UI and ux researcher this individual wears   a lot of different hats and is something that 
I would fail at brutally by the way uh because   what it really entails which is a lot of a lot 
of how would you say it you're really thinking   not only about the design but you're also thinking 
about the of course the user experience and I feel   like I'm terrible at that the fact that I can get 
dressed in the morning is a task on its own I'm   just kidding but UI and ux design so what are some 
Concepts within that one is behavioral research or   conducting Behavioral Studies so user groups focus 
groups another big aspect is accessibility are the   designs you are creating accessible to everyone 
online levels FYI is they have 169,000 for their   their median salary or total comp I should say and 
this is really interesting because of course it's   not an entry-level uh accuracy but it is something 
to start working towards and honestly I didn't   realize that UI and ux researchers could make so 
much I kind of thought it was yeah I didn't know   the the compensation was so high but i' I've 
researched not only on levels FYI but other   resources and that is accurate coming in at number 
eight is Junior cyber security specialist and I   think I've spoken about cyber security and how 
great of a role or great of an field it really   is to get into and as AI continues to dominate 
the tech industry more and more cyber security   Specialists are going to be needed but here's a 
question that I asked myself the other day what   exactly does a cyber security Specialists do like 
what are three main points of responsibility all   right here you go take notes on this so point one 
being analyzing Network structures and testing   security measures such as software permissions and 
firewalls number two being ensuring the company   data remains secure by protecting it from cyber 
attx and this is done through various different   ways which I'll share with you in a second here 
and then the number three thing would be designing   and implementing data recovery plans in case of 
cyber attacks so not only are you ensuring the   data remains secure but you're also preparing and 
designing uh data recovery plans so it's there is   a lot of responsibilities cyber security even if 
it might not be the position you want to get into   maybe you want to get into say the web developer 
role or product manager role you will need it's   across the board though that cyber security 
knowledge is essential and it's continuing to   just go up Skyrocket in that direction all right 
cyber security money let's talk money what can you   expect all right for this one it was not on levels 
FYI so I went to glass door that is such a tongue   twister by the way cyber security specialist make 
all right let's see what it says for a junior role   it starts off around 82,000 us and that sounds 
pretty accurate if you ask me we are talking   entry level role you are going to be making a 
pretty good salary entering into the tech industry   coming in at number seven is product manager 
and for a long time I thought you had to have   years of experience before getting into product 
management because that's typically the career   path we used to see now though I have seen so many 
people after they are graduating business school   computer science depending on where they are at 
but both Technical and non-technical go straight   into product management roles entry-level product 
managers are often times shadowing more senior   level product managers that are more experienced 
and they are maybe taking on not as many tasks   or big projects or products on their own but 
rather helping out with their large or more   senior large why would they be large more senior 
product manager and often times they are crucial   in guiding and leading the team to success when 
building out a product Now product managers can   make bank they can make quite a bit of money and 
so much so that levels FYI is stating the median   comp to be $195,000 us we're starting out with way 
less than that for entry levels we're starting out   below the hundreds for entry levels the reality is 
but it is a good number to start working towards   next up let's go to one that doesn't require 
necessarily getting into the code as much per   se which is Tech sales engineer and yes some of 
these Tech sales Engineers might be building and   uh creating demos for their clients or solving 
problems as they are selling the product itself   but a lot of tech sales engineers it doesn't 
mean coding on a day-to-day basis but rather   understanding the technology now for course I 
would take on code academy for Tech sales engineer   I'd probably start out with a basic level coding 
course or an introduction to coding it can really   vary based on the company you work for but even 
more so aside from that because once again coding   is not necessarily required but that understanding 
of coding or how the tech works is really required   so it really vary based on company okay also 
too quickly for salary can't forget the salary   or compensation they didn't have this on lels FYI 
so I went to a company called zipia and they are   estimating around 88,000 I have to keep in mind 
with sales they often times we'll get a lower base   salary and this might not necessarily I'm guessing 
the base salary for someone whose entry level will   be even lower than what I just said for the reason 
of sales often times have large bonuses and really   work on what deals they are able to close that 
will affect their bonuses also I don't think   you can but there's a full-on marathon going on 
out inside my window so if you hear any like cow   bells it's cuz they're cheer people on can you 
hear it I'm hoping not but there you go coming   in at what number are we coming in at number five 
we're coming in at number five coming in at number   five is Junior iOS Developer we don't hear a ton 
about iOS developers as much I think as we used   to which is interesting and I think the reason is 
because a lot of us right now well I don't really   know why but it's still very in demand when I 
was doing research as far as how the industry   is hiring for it where it is at it is continuing 
to rise up and up up up up now because this role   is still so in demand the salary reflects that 
182,000 is a median comp for iOS salary and one   of the thing is this salary I think will continue 
to vary based on company location you know the   drill but it's definitely a number to work towards 
you know this list would not be complete I mean   we couldn't even do this list if I didn't list 
this next one because it is still I would say the   most trendiest job title and I always get asked 
about it you know what it is what is it say it   for me data scientist of course this is still 
such a trendy and you know rightfully so it's   still very in demand I do see other roles though 
that we will talk about coming up which might be   taking the spot for number one but data science 
is still so in demand we often hear this term   data scientist data scientist but what does a data 
scientist even do in simple terms let's let's list   off like three main or three key points this is 
not three I don't know where this came from let's   list off three main points first one being data 
collecting and cleaning so collecting importing   and cleaning data to ensure accuracy which is so 
important completeness and uniformity making sure   essentially that this data is things that we can 
then actually lean on to lean on lean on to the   next one is exploratory data analysis or Eda and 
this is conducting exploratory data analysis to   understand the characteristics and distributions 
of the data the third one being let's visualize   this data data visualiz ization conducting uh 
or creating visualizations to represent data   Trends distributions and relationships among the 
variables now let's get to the good part salary I   mean that's why we all want to be a data scientist 
right I'm just kidding all right levels FYI this   is not necessarily entry level position but let's 
go in with the medium total comp in the US and   this is think of this as something to work towards 
which is 160,000 K I mean that's great that sounds   like a nice number if you ask me coming at number 
three is cloud computing this is an area we've   seen really burst into the scene quite a few years 
ago I would say 3 to four years ago obviously it   was around long before that but that was really 
when it went from going up to all of a sudden   like peeking and everyone started realizing how 
important the cloud is for entry level salaries   for cloud computing roles I they didn't have it 
on levels FYI so I went on to zip recruiter which   is a recruiting company and the entrylevel cloud 
computing salary in the US I don't I don't know   if this is accurate it says it's 118,000 yeah that 
makes sense 118,000 us per year so this is a rle   at entry level you can get in just below a 100 or 
just above a 100 which I mean is great if you ask   me coming in at number two is something that some 
of you might say is a mythical unicorn or I guess   unicorn on its own is mythical so we don't need 
to say it's Mythic you go what I'm saying a lot   of you don't even a lot of people in the tech 
industry like this role isn't real however why   is it coming at number two because it is one of 
the most in demand jobs still so it is real but   we just need to set our expectations accordingly 
what do you think I'm talking about this is full   stack developer full stack developer full stack 
engineer you are someone who is not only able to   build with the front end but also build back end 
and also understand system design I mean the list   can go on as to your responsibilities the the 
one of the most in demand roles companies are   hiring for because a lot of companies don't 
have the funds to hire for both a front end   back in developer if they're starting out so 
they're going to pay even more money but for   one individual all right but it costs less to 
hire than one individual than two you get what   I'm saying on levels FYI for median comp the 
total is 149,000 once again not entry level   but something to work towards and I've seen the 
salary go up way higher than this as well coming   in at number one you know what this entails number 
one is AI engineer of course it is of course it's   something with AI right now I mean it would be 
inaccurate if it wasn't AI is everywhere bursting   onto the scene and there are so many entrylevel 
roles with AI that are available today because of   how quickly it is moving the roles or the people 
to fill these roles are not able to keep up what   does exactly an AI engineer do like what does it 
really consist of here are three things one is   designing developing and optimizing machine 
learning models another is implementing AI   solutions to meet the business needs and number 
three would be working with data scientists and   other stakeholders to ensure the AI Solutions 
are implemented effectively this role can vary   greatly based on company to company but those are 
three kind of good pillars to focus in on now I   went back to zip recruiter for this salary for the 
entry level AI engineer salary it's around 62,000   per year and you might be saying well Tiff why 
is this number one then if it's not the highest   paying salary because it might not be number one 
in salary but in demand as far as skills go and   where the salary will go it is number one that's 
why I put it as number one but at the end of the   day all of these roles have so much opportunity 
for you to really start your career in and just   take off we always talk about talk Tech as an 
industry which it is but Tech touches every   industry and it's not going anywhere ever this is 
probably in my opinion the most secure industry   you can get into if you really want to grow and 
have a successful career now maybe I'm biased cuz   I work in Tech but I just I don't know the data 
and the numbers are there okay hi friends I'm   coming to you from the future well when you watch 
this it will be the past but I was going through   this video and I realized I need to share with you 
some incredible resources to help you get these   kind of roles get into these positions we talk a 
lot about what positions are in demand what jobs   are in demand but how do you level up how do you 
upscale to get into them this is something when I   was first learning to code and even now working in 
the tech industry for almost 7 years I still face   where to go well I know where to go but upskilling 
is a forever thing so I thought I'd share with   you some courses on code academy that will help 
you level up specifically one around full stack   engineering because that really can touch multiple 
roles with different facets of it and then also to   the other one around AI let's start with fullstack 
Engineering also to fun fact code academy was one   of the first resources I used when I was learning 
to code so shout out to code academy for helping   me land my first job and then continue to level up 
all right on screen here we have their full stack   engineer course and this will include JavaScript 
node SQL Express react test driven development   and more and one of my favorite things about not 
only this course but a lot of different learning   paths that they have to offer is that they offer a 
certification you can put this on your resume that   you have a certification in full stack engineering 
not to mention it doesn't hurt that the salary   that they have here for average salary is 120 
sounds pretty good to me that's supposed to be   a chef's kisss you know what I mean the Emoji 
all right so this starts with from beginner   and you will work your way down so this is really 
incredible they say time to complete is around 6   months and you can do this with zero prerequisites 
if you are someone who wants to learn how to code   become a full stock developer this course is 
for you all right the other one because I came   in at number one we have to do something around AI 
engineer this is something that I haven't actually   started taking this course yet but I think it 
will be the next course I take mainly because   my next role will not be in AI engineering but 
as a developer and someone who always likes to   build it's so relevant today and I'm just really 
fascinated and curious about it so I think this   will be my next uh course I take so if you're 
taking it let me know in the comments and this   takes about 4 months to complete certification 
check mark yes and prerequisites none so this   is another amazing course I really like how to 
they are really focusing on trending Technologies   python machine learning they go into pandas get 
bash it's really covers the full spectrum so when   you are done this course you feel really prepared 
to take on that next step in your career or go   to apply to different jobs that you might want 
what whatever the case may be all right I hope   you enjoyed this video and leave it feeling really 
inspired as to where your career can go what roles   maybe you're interested in that you didn't even 
know about or consider for yourself also too if   you're interested in leveling up with code academy 
they are offering 1 month free for code academy   Pro for the first few people who sign up with
