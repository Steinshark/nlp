- In this video, I will be
giving 1 million subscribers to one of these four small YouTubers. (all cheering)
(suspenseful music) I'm gonna need you to put your hand on my diamond play button. Okay. Whichever one of them
takes their hand off last gets a shout out at the end of the video. When I shouted out my brother
in this video right here he gained over a million
subscribers in under 24 hours. You could gain like 2 or 3
million, like not even joking. So what's your channel name? - [Voice 1] Nope. - What's your channel name? - [Voice 2] Bruh. - What about you? - [Voice 3] Deez nutz. - You?
- I'm (intense wailing) - Sadly, we had to bleep it all out because only the winner of this
challenge gets a shout out. Every time they say the
name of their channel it will be bleeped. Here's a thousand dollars. Here's a thousand dollars, in two smaller rubber bands. I wanna teach you guys
how to give away money. So stay here. - Wait, is this our thousand dollars? - I don't know.
- Probably give it away. - I think we're giving
it away to somebody. - I ordered pizzas from
four different restaurants. - Hey! - Can each of you give a
pizza to a different person? - Here is a tip of $1,000. - Huh? Thank you! - This is for you, my friend. - There's a tip. I appreciate the pizza. - Yeah. Give me a high five.
- High five. - Heck yeah. - Could you just say into the camera, subscribe to- - [Voice 3] Deez Nutz. - Subscribe to-
- Deez Nuts. (all laughing) - Alright, well, it was bleeped. You might as well subscribe
to me though while you're at. - Oh yeah! - Anybody else?
- I'm good. - Good. 'Cause I'm eating the rest. - Alright.
(all laughing) - During this challenge,
we're gonna do lots of similar stuff like that, because one of you is getting
a million subscribers. I'm gonna go set up the next
one. (upbeat rock music) So we have something fun for you guys. Let me show you guys your surprise. Okay, can you guys bring
the podium over here? Don't forget. Even when you're moving,
keep your hands on it. Chill right here, boys. Let's reveal the secret. (car honking) - My car! - What?
(all laughing) - Wait, we get to destroy Karl's car? - We went to your house
and we grabbed your car. - I need to tell my roommates to not let you guys over anymore. Let's do it.
(punching sound effect) - Alright, there we go.
(rock music resumes) On this channel, we've
destroyed tons of cars, and I think it's very
valuable for you guys as well. You need to know how to destroy a car and buy a better one.
(car explodes) - Absolutely.
- This is true. - Yeah.
- This car low key sucks. So I want a few swings at it myself. (intense techno music) - Remember, keep your hands on it. If you let go while you're
swinging, you're still out. (smacking mirror)
(boys laughing) (window shatters)
(boys cheering) Your window's gone. - Yeah, I noticed. - Just wanted to point that out. - Let's go with the pickax. That seems like a much better idea. (windshield thuds)
(boys cheering, laughing) - Nice.
- Nice. (all cheering)
(smacking lights) (excited grunting) - Wait hold up. What was that, Karl? - I think I might have
saw a hand come off. - Mine?
- Yeah. - Seriously? - I might be wrong. I want to be wrong. - Alright, let's look at the footage. - My mind was so focused on that. - On that?
- On that headlight. I should have stuck with that first hit. I got greedy. - Well well well, boys. Do I have footage to show you. The gentleman in question
here is this man right here. Let's get everyone's opinion but his. So this is his hand right here. He's about to start swinging. He's rearing back. And if you look in the
reflection, look there. What's your verdict? - My verdict is that it left the glass. - What's your verdict? - It left the glass.
- It left the glass. - It left the glass.
- Yeah, good. 'Cause if you said it
didn't, you'd be lying. Your hand left the glass. (jolly music)
(bell dings) (intense laughter) - No! - Karl's fault. - [All] Karl's fault! Karl's fault! - [MrBeast] You're out of the contest. You might as well take your hand off now. - Three, two, one.
(suspenseful music) - Oh!
- Oh. - Oh my god, it's cramped.
(all laughing) Thank you for the opportunity. - No problem.
- Amazing, however long we've been here for. And go follow (intense scream). - Ugh.
- That was a longer beep. - That was a really long beep.
- Ugh! - Just head on out.
- Good luck, boys! - Technically, it's
all Karl's car's fault, but you get out.
- It is. - So.
(intense rock music) - Why did I have to
(smacking windshield) focus on Karl's car? (tire thudding)
(all laughing) - What kind of tires you got, bro? - Alright gentlemen,
(fire booms) one down, three remain. One of you three are getting
one million subscribers, or two million.
- That's crazy. - Or three million. I don't know, depends on
how well the video does. So if you were to win and
gain millions of subscribers, what type of content could they expect? - We do-
- Nope! - We do-
- Nope! - Type stuff. We-
- Nope! - We-
- Nope! - People. - I hope to do more
challenges. Things like- - [Voice 3] Deez Nutz! - I make-
- Bruh. - With-
- Bruh. - Way too much over-editing. And I'm never letting go of this button. - Every time we do one
of these long challenges, you guys always comment, "How do they use the
bathroom? This is fake." Usually I don't show it, but we put a bucket, we grab a towel, and we hold it in front of them like this, and we let 'em use the bathroom. You can put the camera down. It's not fake, though, I promise. I'm thinking we start a
really long time lapse. - How long are we talking? - Like, five hours. - Frick.
- Bruh. - Do you guys need anything
before we start this? - Water?
- Water. - Water?
- Water, yeah. - Water, okay. One sec.
- Water. - Yeah, we're gonna start
a five hour time lapse. Let's see if anyone gets out. - Bye guys, for a little bit. (upbeat jazzy music) - It is now morning. You guys survived the first night. How tired are you? - I'm-
- Eh... - I think I was dreaming
with my eyes open, so there's that. - I was obviously expecting
one of you to get out. I'm kinda surprised. Normal people eat food in the morning, so let's go get some food. I pulled up a truck over here. I'm gonna take you guys to a restaurant. - Aw, thank you!
- Alright, let's go! - Slow, slow and steady, please. - If you get out now, you'll regret it for
the rest of your life. - Some of you guys can get in the truck. You're gonna have to pull
this box off the pillar. (box creaks, snaps) The box has been detached. This is making me very nervous. - Rotate, oh sorry.
- Rotate. - All the hands are staying on. Congratulations!
(upbeat rock music) None of you took your hands off. Are you ready to go get some food? - Let's do it!
- Let's do it! (upbeat music resumes) - I'm gonna get this
million subscribers, easy. - Speed bumps, everybody be careful. Ooh!
- Ugh. (upbeat music resumes) - [Cashier] Hi MrBeast! - Hey! - Good luck, guys! - [All] Thank you! - [MrBeast] Now that you guys have food, I have one more stop
planned before we go back. Karl, sit tight. - Okay. (dynamic music) - Karl, how much was your car worth? - $2000? - The car that we smashed. (window shatters)
(rock music) (all cheer) Play it again. (window shatters)
(all cheering) Since it was worth two grand, we're gonna buy you a $15,000 car. - Okay!
(cash register dings) - But they get to pick. (all cheering) We're gonna pull you guys
to the $15,000 cars, okay? - Okay.
- Alright, Karl, what is going through your mind? They're scheming on what
car you should drive. - I'm really worried. I feel like I've been nice to them, so I hope they don't screw me over. - You also thought you were nice to people in the island video, but they also screwed you over. This car right here is under $15,000. If you guys choose, this
can be Karl's new car. - I think this is a
little too nice for Karl. - I think we should get
him something worse. - Yeah yeah yeah.
- Yeah. - Karl sucks! - [All] Karl sucks! - What?
- Karl sucks! - Oh, how about that Juke, though? - Yo, I would-
- I'm kinda- - Yo, how about that Juke? It looks pretty dope! I think it kinda suits Karl. - I just need two yeses. Raise your hand if you yes. I see two hands. Karl, congrats on your Juke, yeah! (all cheer) - [All] Juke Juke Juke
Juke Juke Juke Juke! (upbeat rock music) - Alright boys, welcome
back to the studio. Let's get you back to your usual location. - Let's do it. - Keep those hands on. We're watching, boys. - Let's all be easy, no need to rush. - Alright, the hands are
still on the play button. (rock music) And you're back home! - I haven't had Taco Bell in a while, man. I don't know how it's
gonna affect my body. We'll see what happens.
- I'm glad to be standing, 'cause my butt hurts so bad. - I'm better. I had some food. Yeah, we're doing good. (upbeat jazzy music) - We have three gold play buttons here. Our side channel. My brother's channel, I
took it from him, sorry CJ. And the channel you're currently watching, but this one's different
because it's so old. Since you guys are being stubborn, we have to make it harder. So, pick a number between
one and three, each of you. - Two.
- Three. - One.
- Okay. Three was the number, so you have to hold the bigger one. You now, with your off hand, have to hold a gold play button while keeping your hand
on the diamond play button at the same time. If you drop the golden play button, or it touches the ground
in any way, you're out. - Alright.
- Alright. - Let's do this. - One other thing, who got
my brother's play button? - I did.
- Oof. Sorry about that.
(all laugh) I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. I love you, CJ. That's not a good sign, though. (suspenseful music) It's time to make it harder. This is how you're currently doing it. You have your whole hand
on the diamond play button. You need to pick one finger, starting now. - Pointer finger.
- Alright. - Pointer finger. - Now I'm gonna label these fingers so the viewers can see it. Boom. This finger has to be touching. The rest of your hand is now irrelevant. Oh my gosh, this is
terrifying. Look at it. One finger is all you guys have left, and you still have to carry
the golden play button. If no one gets out anytime soon, we're gonna have to make it way harder. - I'm gonna keep trying, folks. It's on my finger, and
a golden play button. And we'll see how it goes. - I'm tired as heck right now, and a little bit delusional. - I can guarantee this
will not last two hours. - Look at how much effort
they're putting in. Whoever wins, you have
to subscribe to them. - That's right.
- Watch 'til the end. (suspenseful music) I'm putting a bunch of
fire crackers in this pan. Chris, I want you to light 'em, and me and Karl will distract them. - Okay.
(torch blowing) - No, not yet.
- Not right now! - Oh. - I got a few questions to ask you guys. I think we should let them know what type of content
would you make if you won? - Can you say something for the million- - Yeah. - A-
(fire crackers popping) - Nobody?! I thought that was gonna work. Did that scare you? - Uh, no, for some reason. I don't know why.
(all laughing) - What? - None of that mattered. I was just trying to distract you. - You guys are incredible.
- I thought so. You already asked that question. - I know I did.
(Karl laughs) Alright boys, it's time to make it harder. Bring it on in. Like I was telling you, we're gonna elevate it up to here. So you have to hold your hand higher up. (suspenseful music) As you can see, the box is now elevated. It's taller than me. Which is gonna make it harder, 'cause they have to hold their arms up. - Dude, every time I'm like, it can't get any harder. It gets so much harder. - It's a shoulder workout, guys. This is hard. - It's definitely more physically taxing. - My shoulder hurts, and how am I still awake? I don't remember even getting here. - I don't really know what
to do besides time lapse, so I guess I'll see you
guys in like five hours. - We've tried everything, and we just can't scare them. (horn blares) See? We scared Karl, but not them. They don't even flinch! (suspenseful music) - Why are we still here?
(dramatic music) Just to suffer. - We are over 30 hours
into this challenge. It's time for things to get fun. That golden play button is
so close to the ground, man. Speaking of your gold play buttons, I bought my silver ones. You guys now have to
hold a silver play button along with the gold play
button you're holding. Here you go. Just so you know, if you drop the gold play button or the silver play button, you lose. But that's not hard enough, and we need one of you to get out. I'm also gonna put duct
tape on the ground, because like seriously, one
of you needs to get out. You can no longer cross
this orange duct tape line. You have to keep your finger on there, hold the two play buttons, and stand behind that line. Someone, get out! - I'm not gonna make it. I have like a couple seconds left. 'Cause like, my arm is feeling
like it's being ripped off. - Definitely feel my shoulder
getting worked out right now. And I don't know how long I'm gonna last. We'll see. - We have $10,000 in actual
money sitting right here. We will hand you 10 grand, and let you walk out the door. - What if I spin this gold million play button?
- Huh? - This.
- Wait, so how long do you have to spin it? - I'd say a good six seconds. - Yeah. I'll set this 10 grand at your feet and let you keep it. - You'll give me the 10 grand either way. - Either way, yeah. This is very weird, but I'm digging it. - Three, two, one.
- I can't watch. I can't watch, I can't watch.
(timer beeping) - Tell me when.
- Three, four.
- Oh my god. - Five, six! - No way!
- No way! No way! - Did his foot cross the line? Before we check the footage, no matter what, you get 10 grand. - Woo! (laughing) - You've done this before.
- Here's $5,000. - I don't know what just happened. - Here's another 5 grand. That was pretty cool, but as I said, if his foot went in front of the orange line, he's out. We will be back. - [Karl] Either way, you
got the ten grand, though. That's a good feeling. - I know, but a million subscribers. - I can't, dude. I can't. I'm gonna tear my triceps. I can't do it.
(gasping) - Jimmy! - Okay, so do I let go? - Yeah, you did cross the line. I said you couldn't.
(dramatic music) Give him hugs. I'm sorry.
- You did great, man. You did great, man.
- Dude, I'm so sorry. You did fantastic. - You fought hard, and I also wanted to give you $10,000. - What, really?
- Just as a gift. 30 hours is literally insane. - Yeah.
- Dang, thanks man. God, I'm too tired for all this. (all laughing) - Absolutely loved having Adam here. Poor guy. I mean, sad to see him go. We were all here for each other, so.
- Man. - Does it feel good to sit down? - Yes, it feels amazing.
- Yeah. We are reviewing footage (intense scream) and we're reviewing footage for (intense scream) I know
both those are bleeped. These two guys. (suspenseful music) Alright gentlemen, I have some footage to show you. - Those are my feet. - This is while you were spinning the gold play button, okay? Alright, this is where you
start. Oh, right there. You stepped over the line.
(dramatic music) Yep, you can.
- Oh my gosh. - Oh! (laughing) Well, you won 10 grand. - I did win 10 grand.
- Yeah, see? It wasn't for nothing. You still won-
- Go check out my channel! - [Voice 3] Deez Nutz. - Ah, still bleeped. But you want to know what's not bleeped? This guy right here!
- Oh my god. - Take your finger off, okay.
- I'm gonna trip. - You can now say your channel name, and it will not be bleeped. - Zealous.
(horns blaring) - Alright, go subscribe. Get him to a million subscribers, because I said he would get it, and if he doesn't, I'm a liar, and I feel bad. - Oh my gosh! - So you wanna tell them
what they can expect? - I'm gonna do my absolute best to put out the best content, and I'm gonna put it out as frequently as possible for you guys. - I can tell by talking to you, like you really want it.
- Oh my god, yeah. - You wanted it to happen. Go subscribe, right here, Zealous. Thank you for watching, goodbye. ♪ MrBeast6000 ♪
