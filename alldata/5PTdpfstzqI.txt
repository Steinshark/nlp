all right 2023 JavaScript Rising Stars welcome to the eighth edition of JavaScript Rising Stars the place to see the trends about the JS ecosystem now the best part is if we click through this let's just do a quick at the end of this actually let's do a quick click through and watch the fact that I bet you every single year there's going to be things you've heard of that were the hottest ever in that year and are just either not like like debunked or just like considered cold as a fish okay so let's like this the following graphs compare the number of stars added on GitHub over the last 12 months obviously the most scientific measurement we analyze projects coming from best of JS a curated list of best projects related to web platform oh okay so your bias is what you're trying to say note that you can click on the project to get more info okay most popular overall projects okay okay oh my goodness HTM X mentioned let's go HDMX mentioned you got drizzle over here oh baby I don't even know what those two rings are that doesn't look like the f that almost looks like the ven diagram of furries and rust programmers it's just it it it's it's it's more of a circle than it is two circles you know what I mean all right so let's let's let's just go all the way down just start looking at them one one at a time okay all right most popular projects overall all right Shad CDN Shad CN UI okay I've seen this just so much I don't even know what the Shad is uh the hottest project of the year is shad I ction of UI components written in react allowing customizable styling through Tailwind CSS built on top of radic a set of headless components providing primitive Primitives for concerns like accessibility and keyboard interactions oh that's cool okay because those are shitty things to program honestly Real Talk those are shitty things to program but doesn't a lot of HTML these days just come with like if you use the proper htmls don't you get a lot of the accessibility just for freezy yeah real talk also when are we going to have react database components versus this like server components okay we just got my we just got my squeal JavaScript I think we need database components all right anyways let's see distinguish itself from other popular librar such as mui Shakra UI react Spectrum by not by not being downloadable npm package instead you integrate Shad CN UI components through a terminal command that installs the underlying dependencies and copies the component source code directly into your code base for further modifications ah a little bit of a vendor style okay okay we got you know okay Shad coming in there with a little bit of like some old school kind of vendor style okay that's pretty cool I I actually appreciate that because the reality is is I mean okay so this is kind of almost like a what's it called a suckless style the the obvious down part about this is that if there's updates you're effed like is my guess is your effed if you make any modifications but the good part is is that you get to make modifications and it's part of your build system and you get to strip out whatever you want blah blah blah blah I I can appreciate that I can appreciate that the Project's success is closely tied to the widespread popularity of Tailwind uh its compatibility with react server components soon database components and the presence of excellent documentation it seems all new shiny react projects have adopted Shad CN UI e uh it was even chosen by Kent C dods for his Cutting Edge epic stack cutting edge bleeding edge full frontal Edge all right let's let's move on to number two bun the champion of 2022 keeps it tremendous momentum but bun aims to be fast all-in-one toolkit for running building testing and debugging JavaScript and typescript applications you know I I'm not I I I I I don't think 2024 is going to be the year of BUN and I'm not sure how great Bun's going to be and I don't mean that it's not an impressive project I don't mean that it's fantastic I love that it uses Zig I'm very happy that they're modern modernizing a lot of stuff but one of the huge problems that you always run into with bun is like let's say you make a bun specific SCP script what happens well now you have to tell your coworker to go get Bun that's kind of it's It's kind of tough you know what I mean to be like oh yeah you need bun you need you got to go get a bun you know what I mean go get those buns boy right like I I don't really I don't really love the idea and second off I don't think it's a it's an amazing iteration on JavaScript still I I need to be convinced of that I think that once the uh the react native team finishes off their static Hermes their sheres and creates a runtime around sheres I'll tell you what that on the other hand that is an exciting project that is super exciting I'd love to see sheres uh 2024 2025 amazing absolutely amazing all right all right we also have some other ones on here we do have H HTM X look at HTM X by the way you want to guess about what month I started saying HTM X was cool you want to also guess what month fireship said HTM X was cool you also want to guess what month TJ told me about HDMX yeah you want to you know you know what the best part about HDMX it's most popular months spells Json the very thing in which HTM X is destroying like to me the just life has always been art unknown to thee it's so good Illuminati confirmed this is so beautiful it's so beautiful I'm surprised that react is still doing good oh look at that oh look at that react on the down swing do you think react is going to be on the tippity top because isn't this about when server components started coming out F my there's nothing that starts with a that I could say there yeah see you guys got nothing either earth oh Earth Earth yes Earth yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah a drizzle is really really exciting drizzle is exciting in the sense that their account is wild when I got totally dunked on on Twitter and someone totally just manipulated a situation drizzle came to my Aid and just dunked back so epically it was incredible I have such respect for the drizzle the drizzle fellas by the way also drizzle they're they're pretty integrated with turo if you don't know tuo tuo so awesome that they even give me a short link Dez nuts okay de's nuts and not only that but if you do t. Tech t. Tech Prime Brazil they're taking me to Brazil and their goal is to have 100 production apps built over the next couple months as as excitement for going to Brazil yeah they're flying me to Brazil Brazil mentioned yeah Brazil mentioned where's the gift where's the gift of the boy dancing with the dog let's go let's go it's early May by the way early May early May let's go let's go Prime to Brazil Prime Brazil anyways okay let's keep on going let's keep on going uh overall winter Shad okay I I mean that's semi-interesting okay front end Frameworks react is still crushing it but look at the difference here I do think that this is really interesting look at this look at this kind of like this versus look at HDMX we're I mean we're still looking good we're still looking good HDMX only barely underw react way too dank it is way too dank react 2023 maintains its position as Forerunner as the the the front runner I said Forerunner uh that's Halo Halo gets in the brain every now and then in JavaScript ecosystem a trend persisting uh from 2001 and 2002 or 2021 and 2022 despite occasional criticisms and controversies controversies how how did the Brit how do them Brits say it controversies uh celebrating its 10th anniversary react earned a documentary watch it here it says a lot about the popularity however react is not without its Skeptics some view it as a relic of the past a sentiment ex uh expertly explored in this article Antiquated react okay interesting that delves into alternative Solutions on the flip side proponents lawed react for its remarkable adapt adaptability and capacity for reinvention fair that's fair all right let's read HTM X come on HTM X people hmx uh let's see at 2 HTM X is a library that takes a different approach to provide interactivity to HTML page rather than writing several lines of JavaScript code okay who this is like the world's most underwhelming cell of all time the word several here means about 1 million okay like you got to remember that these websites come with literally hundreds of thousands of lines of JavaScript so to say the word several lines feels a lot of heavy several is doing a lot of heavy lifting in this sent sentence it is we're going deep okay let's see developer enhance HML with specific attributes to enable real-time interactivity and dynamic updates it was lotted for its small size and seamless integration with existing serers side Frameworks not only that but existing uh client side Frameworks like that's the thing about HDMX is that it can be put anywhere because it doesn't have opinions like every other framework as part of its Trend to send HTML over the wire let's see as it's part of the trend send HTML over the wire ask uh ask the server to send partial blocks of HML instead of handling Json in the client okay in the same space of tagging libraries Alpine JS is a popular solution number 13 this year cool cool spelt I'm very happy with spelt I think spelt if I were to have to choose a frontend framework like someone said hey you're not someone put a gun to my head and said hey you're not allowed to use hmax what do you use I'd probably use felt real talk I'd probably just use felt I like spelt I think spelt is is is about where I want to be it's about where I want to be okay people are saying well what about cross-side scripting I know you guys are all Ming over there but people are actually worried about cross-side scripting um Real Talk sanitize your data you dummy okay general rule of thumb store it raw with database sanitization sanitize it and Escape it on the way down that's like my rule of thumb but other people have different rules of thumb uh generally I don't like to uh sanitization can be bypassed well of course it can no but you could but that that completely exists everywhere else if you change the data to be different in the javascripts hey some people some people try to sanitize before they put into the database I don't think that's a good plan and some people think that the client should do the sanitization which I also don't think is the good plan I think that you should have just the right place so anyways okay react ecosystem I don't honestly I don't care care about the react ecosystem The View ecosystem also don't care lovely the backend full stack uh ecosystem all there's Theo look Theo won good job Theo did we at least get really you're telling okay so why is HDMX not here where's HTM X I don't get it doesn't HT okay because first off HDMX was under what appears to be front-end Frameworks it's literally not a front-end framework like it's not a front end framework I guess since it has no Tech technically backend it's not a it's not a backend thing htx is a server solution I'm not sure what you'd call it it might be better to call it a full stack solution only if you combine it with HML the programming language Fair that's fair it's not a backend thing that's true HTM X is not a backend thing okay fair I I will buy that um honestly I don't like any of these Solutions also notice that none of these are non oh yeah I guess this is Javascript I'm kind of dumb there this is only JavaScript my bad on that one okay build tools um honestly I hate all these build tools I really am just not a fan of the JavaScript world right now and its build systems honestly it's like it's just like everybody's version of of cake like honestly there's actually there's only one ecosystem that's worse than JavaScript and there's only one ecosystem or two ecosystems that are worse than cmake or the C++ world because the C++ where like you know you just kind of have to go out there and you have to choose what you want to do you want bazelle Ninja seake you want your cakes to make your ninjas it's annoying it's annoying I hate it but JavaScript is worse and Python's worse than JavaScript so you know what I mean you know what I mean why is bun there cuz bun bundles bun literally bundles it's a bundler anyways okay mobile interesting mobile stuff I don't know anything about mobile I know react native is really popular people love react native I don't I don't know anything about react native what's better than JS uh rust go Zig um any language any language created in the last 15 years is pretty much better than in than JavaScript and the bundling o camel um PHP csharp uh I don't think you know pretty much anything is better you know what I mean almost anything is better if like the the the hard part Elixir I'm sure Elixir is better isn't oam old it is old but it's Reinventing itself well I think the thing is is if you haven't used another language and you've only used JavaScript you just like don't understand it's impossible to tell you why you know what I mean it's impossible to tell you why a language is better and when I bet mean better I mean bundling style bundling is just so good all right Styles I really like Tailwind I'm surprised we're not seeing any Tailwind in here is Tailwind why is Tailwind not in here what is this styling CSS oh CSS injs Uno I've been hearing a lot about Uno I'm I'm I'm very curious about this Uno isn't Uno like a response to tailwind and it's supposed to be smaller and a little bit easier to work with Tailwind is not injs but it's okay this is only styling SL CSS okay I thought it was styling slash CSS and JS but it's actually styling CSS njs I see what you're saying I see what you're saying I put the njs with higher priority than the slash does that make sense see I had I had like I had the njs as like multiplicative I just didn't I goofed it up all right testing play R play R's been really popular Puppeteer is still really po popular I I I deal with a lot of Puppeteer these days and there's some things that are really annoying about Puppeteer but I guess our Puppeteer is more of a handrolled one uh it it fulfills all the Puppeteer uh interfaces but it's not it's not puppeteer itself and so maybe that's part of the problem um maybe we just have some things that aren't fully baked out but it's I mean Puppeteer is really impressive I really like what we built um I'm very happy with it it's still it's still very interesting playright I assume is it's just like a slightly different version of Puppeteer I've looked at some of the interfaces I don't know how much different playright really is than Puppeteer I haven't even heard of storybook and I've heard of Cyprus Cypress also kind of feels the same way which is it just feels uh playright is more popular because it allows other languages than J JS oh interesting that's cool that's cool vit test I'm very curious about how vit test works I want to actually I want to go investigate how vest Works uh because I don't like how just works and so I'm curious if vit test fixes some of the things that J does dumbly you know what I mean yeah static sites Astro is awesome I love Astro I guess I haven't used next s ever besides for like a brief moment um what do I what don't I like about uh just the memory usage memory usage is wild here uh check this out uh just test here it's really easy for me just to run this really quickly uh let's go like this um and go like that uh personal there you go I'm running two tests I'm literally only running two tests maybe 7,000 lines of code it's just a lot you know and if I had more CPUs that number just goes up you know what I mean because those are all just node processes that are running anyways State Management uh State Management I feel like I feel like State Management is I'm very first off I'm very happy to see re damn it Redux is right there damn it Redux is right there um I'm very I I would be much much more happy to see State Management kind of die because I feel like State Management is an answer to a problem created by heavy clients so you create these heavy clients we then realize that they frequently get out of sync with the server cash and validation super hard and requesting more data can be difficult because you have slight Nuance between some of the data you request so you want to be able to reduce the amount of serers side chattiness that you have so you come up with all these different ways to maintain State and to be able to update your state throughout the application because again locality of behavior just doesn't exist in JavaScript modern front ends like there is no locality of behavior you have data come down go into store Store updates some set of components like you have this like incredible distance between where something comes in versus where something comes back out State Management is I I feel like a solution to a problem that doesn't need to exist graph quel tan stack Tanner's awesome I'm curious what he what he's doing to do all this I'd actually like to just look at tan stack just to see it because I just think that Tanner's awesome and I'd like to see what he has to do I don't know uh you want to kiss me right now Puck her up baby uh let's recap some of the stories and dramas of 20 oh let's see let's hear it spelt codebase ditching typescript fi uh files I actually while preserving type safety um okay guys type linting okay it's really just type linting but uh spelt I think this was a good move and I think that more people need to do this JS Doc is incredible in DTS files DTS files plus uh JS Doc is this really the way to go I don't know why people want to keep making crazy build systems you can avoid you can have the same type safety as typescript using DTS and JS doc just saying down to type man I'm DT I'm dtt okay down to type controver around react either too old too complicated PHP like I think PHP like is actually their best move becoming more backend Focus very good I'm happy about that I'm very very happy about that they just didn't go far enough uh too complicated absolutely agree with that one I think that they got to figure out how to slim things down right become less of everything become something more specific uh the fall of Rome and the rise of biome where's Constantinople in there uh angular rejuvenated I remember when angular got signals and they're like no we're cool and people are like n you're not you know when Joe Dirt is by the gravel road and I think the guy's name is Rodney or whatever uh whatever uh that girl that he leg's boyfriend uh comes up and like sprays some rock and dirt on him like peeling out and he's like uh he's like sorry if I got you there Joe and he's just like uh I'm cool and he's like no you're not love that scene that's angular angular is literally that scene the release of bun one that was pretty controversial for those that don't remember bun One released version one but I just don't think it was version one right it just wasn't it just wasn't version one it was still it's probably more it's it's closer to version one now Astro 40 let's go Styx Open Source by meta that seems interesting Theo loves Styx I'm curious about it I'd love to see more about it um all right uh c i Let's see we saw the rise of AI tools that can generate UI prompts yes uh v0 is actually really incredible I still think v0 is one of my uh what is it vdev I actually really appreciate this thing right here uh twitch dashboard to monitor chatting and uh activities such as subs and follows the reason why I really like this is that when it generates this I can go and grab just the HTML and then I use that with HTM X you know imagine getting tricked by another CSS injs dude tell me about it it is wild it is wild that people keep getting tricked by J CSS injs like stop it stop getting Bamboozled people hold let me turn off uh dark readers for vzero look at that look at that look look at that look how cool that is you got subscribers look at this it's building out a nice little dashboard right here how cool is that it's pretty cool I think it's amazing you love vzero but have no idea what Shad CN uh was vzer is just sad Shad CN components well no vzo is is more than Shad CN components you know it's slightly more because you can also get HTML like pretty cool huh I mean I love that like look at this HTML look at that HTML with Tailwind how great is that there you go great content cool can't wait for the next stream bro but there you go look at that Beauty look at that Beauty look at that beauty so now I can take this and just make it the way I want because you know what let's just face it I can't make whatever this is I would not have come up with that pretty thing like I wouldn't have and so now you actually get to do the programming you know what I mean we going to lose our jobs no absolutely not just think about it this way the reason why this is so cool is that I can simply just go from0 to 10 right you're not going to 0 to 60 like you're not trying to build a UI off this here's another version of it which I actually really like this one this one's re look at that let's go this is good this one is really good right this one gives you nothing it's just boilerplate right this is no different than having Auto Imports this is just Auto Imports of CSS user one based dude you just imagine having user one yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah anyways I love this stuff I think this I love this to me this is the greatest version of what AI can do today which is don't do a lot just give me a little bit okay let me make the decisions I just want you to just give give me your seed give me your seed boy that's all I want is I just want your seeds you know what I mean user three followed you confirmed but isn't this awesome I think it's awesome clip it all right anyways so as I pen down the summary for the eighth time one can uh help but Wonder Could AI take over next year probably I assume so but not the way people are thinking I just don't imagine okay just really quickly let's just do something really quickly let's go back one year and let's see what our most popular overall projects are bun tar react next Vite tier CP VSS code playright are the most popular projects front and Frameworks react quick solid felt view2 view3 angular HTM X look at that guy go he was even in there look at that but look at what we got here HDMX goes way up everything else else goes way down um ecosystem look at all these guys isn't it funny how this happens now let's go back one more year just one more year so now we're only on 2021 most overall popular projects Google ZX what the hell is that does anybody know what ZX is we're only two years back does anybody have an idea what ZX is Vite next react tari Tailwind vs code again nakod DB no idea slly slev no idea es build 3js nice okay some of these we can recognize electron axios strappy you gotta be careful about that strappy baby uh dino headless like okay bootstrap was on there all right let's go back to 2020 let's see what what happens Dino what happen if you go and choose the most popular project for 2020 you're you're currently using Dino and Vue right now not even vue2 Vue also just this dude edex UI I don't even know what that is Rome there's Rome you'd be using Rome a nice build system you you'd be on this nice bespoke uh build system that officially died two years later Rome is dead I know exactly how great is that You' have to have a whole ass new thing it's biome now ant design all right let's go back to 2019 view vs code react view element axios ant design now you're definitely using ant design okay we never even heard of it after 2021 material UI let's go 3js is apparently just this guy's picture at this point that's pretty that's pretty dope 2018 what do we got here we got view react vs code Dino Puppeteer create react app ant design I don't even know what DJs is parcel material prettier D3 these nuts got them create react app I know I know look at this and now let's go to this one okay what do we got we got view react create react app Puppeteer prettier is much higher at this point electron just killing it element we don't even know about elements anymore web pack oh you better get your web pack on better get your web pack on 2016 what do we got we got view react electron react native Redux oh yeah you're getting Redux imagine how great it's going to be to you're putting in bootstrap for your views like look at I mean and you're getting look web packed like just take a second and think about this choosing popular technology you could be stuck with some pretty interesting choices you could be having bootstrap Redux and webpack and react as your front end it's not getting worse it's the same okay remember whatever is on 2023 today you will have the exact same feelings in the same amount of time viable still it's still viable but it's a pain in the ass we have that sucks to suck I'm just saying just remember everything on here you're going to have a very similar feeling with in a couple years shush I'm trying to Shazam the song playing no I'm not shushing anyways so just so you guys know enjoy yourself build things don't get tightly coupled to them you blame Trump in 2016 for this one I would blame him too obviously this was a response to the 2016 election is to put Javascript Rising Stars up there okay obviously um damn huh damn look at this but it's just it's just all all this is to me is just a really great reminder to just know that whatever you choose likely will not be useful in a couple years excal draw has had a really excal draw has actually remained really high for a while congratulations excal draw people have continue to like you and follow you and being excited about this you know but at the end of the day it's why you should learn underlying principles and not just put all of your eggs into a singular libraries basket you know what I mean take time and explore and understand be awesome learn the fundamentals because you know what real talk Tech debt has never been easier it's a fact look at react react was number one or two Vue was number one for like three years in a row it's not even on the top 10 it's not even in the top 20 where the hell is Vue Vue is 39 this year it was the tippity top for like four years running and then just plummeted stars do not matter Stars don't Stars don't matter it's established but react is still going right and arguably it's more established you know what I mean one could arguably say that react is more established than view yet it's still there so htx is dead next year could be I'm going to still use it because I love htx htx is one of those things in which I can use my foundational knowledge to continue to program well into the future that's why I like HTM X oh v0o crashed my bad oh it's still going it's still going it's still going anyways I group on these streets too this was me this was me I played the  out of this game all right anyways the name is the front enden
