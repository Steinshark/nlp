[Music] I used to think that that Tiff that 
person was what was required if I was using   the terminal when I first started learning how 
to code I thought I want to get to that level   where I have tons and tons of tournamentals open 
and I'm just this hardcore coder only to grow   in my coding career become a senior developer 
and realize I want the opposite of that I want   something that is user friendly helps me work 
faster and quicker not this ridiculous complex   and very unnecessary setup today I'm going to 
be taking you with me to really explore warp   warp as they say on their website and honestly 
after you play around with it I'm sure you will   agree is the terminal for the 21st century it 
is so user friendly really helps with various   workflows and okay I'm gonna dive into it in 
a second but first let's go get some coffee   okay we got all of our we got all the drinks 
please tell me that I am not the only one who   cannot work or start working unless I have all 
of the drinks but most importantly obviously   coffee [Music] today we are going to be diving 
into warp and I'm sure you've seen warp on   social media or from other people or maybe heard 
about it and there's a good reason for it when I   started playing around with warp which is quite 
a while ago actually because I was like many of   you I kept on seeing it come up and organically 
online people were talking about I'm like what is   what is why is this terminal so special or what 
makes it everyone so excited about it so I want   to share with you today about warp and how it can 
really improve your process using a terminal also   too when you're starting out or even when you're 
senior I mean I'll speak for myself anyways using   the terminal there's always things about it 
that come up that really are annoying or I   get lazy and in turn I just don't take the time to 
really learn properly or I spend my entire career   Googling warp solves a lot of that it has a very 
friendly CLI and you know I'm on their website   right now they describe themselves as the terminal 
for the 21st century and I think that is so true   because when you really think a lot about some 
of the terminals we use and how we use them it's   the same in many ways that we've used them for 
way too long like it's not evolving or advancing   so warp really took it to the next level and I'm 
really excited to dive into it with you today to   the things that we'll dive into in a bit here but 
that really stood out to me about warp is their   input editor and also two blocks so with our input 
editor it's essentially a full text editor that   supports selections cursor positioning shortcuts 
that you're used to using in other apps so the   UI you user experience not UI but yeah no user 
experience is very friendly and something that   you're familiar with doing in other apps already 
also too I'm a huge visual person or a visual   learner visual worker and I really enjoy how 
they have blocks in their terminal so what that   means is commands and output are visually grouped 
together into blocks so you can select which block   you would like and see all your different commands 
that you've been using in Block section so it's   very visual now both of these will dive into more 
but I just wanted to highlight them as well that   these are two areas that really made warp stand 
out from me all right let's dive into modern text   editing at first I was like this isn't that big of 
a deal modern text editing what really is it until   you start playing around with it and you realize 
how many pain points that this really resolved   so let me pull up their documentation to start 
with unlike other terminals warps input editor   operates out of the box like a modern IDE and the 
text editors we're used to okay interesting warp   supports soft wrapping in the input editor if 
there's Auto suggestions that go off screen the   input editor will be horizontally scrollable 
to make it more visible that's also really   interesting alright so you can see here they also 
share how to use it different shortcuts to use for   it in the description let's start playing around 
with it alright on screen now I have opened the   warp terminal and one thing I really like about 
it is if you see here in the top right hand   corner when you open this up it will give you warp 
Essentials also too if you click on this little   keyboard here you will have access to keyboard 
shortcuts so the UI is really user friendly it   allows you to get started really quickly which I 
love because something I think I'm gonna say as   most developers oftentimes we just want something 
to work which is kind of counter-intuitive as to   what our jobs are a lot of the time things don't 
work a lot of the time but when you're introducing   a new tool into your workflow the last thing you 
want is it for it to be difficult to use you want   it to just work you have enough problems on the 
go so I like how they have these warp Essentials   and then also too they have warp AI which is 
right here which we will dive into in a sec but   to get back to the modern text editor one thing 
I think is really cool is let's write a sentence   here just uh say today in Toronto is very warm 
I love the sunshine okay now one of the first   things you will notice is typically you are not 
able to click anywhere you want in a terminal in   this case so you can so for example say I made 
a spelling mistake or I wanted to change a word   which is so common when you're writing commands 
you can simply click wherever you would like   and make this change very cold that's pretty 
accurate it's very cold in Toronto another   thing with this text editor is you can write 
multi-line so if you simply enter so you want   to enter twice tomorrow is going to be a bit 
warmer in the city so this is really interesting   as well you can keep on writing multi-lines so 
when you are say looking inside a folder then   going inside of it it's very easy to do all at 
once in a very user-friendly way like it looks   very nice which I think nowadays because we 
are using so many different applications that   are user friendly our terminal needs to reflect 
that as well another thing you can do is select   the entire editor so say you want to completely 
start again we do no longer need to oftentimes   I'll just quit the terminal because I don't 
want to keep on hitting the backspace so this   is really handy as well you can also copy and 
paste so say copy start a new line and paste this   very user friendly very simple to get started with 
next up I want to talk about blocks you can see on   screen here I am back in their documentation I 
always go back to the documentation because as a   reminder to myself that's the best place to start 
always and right now we are under block Basics it   shows you how to create a block select a single 
block a lot we'll get into select multiple blocks   but essentially as you can see here just even 
in this clip you can see how these are blocked   these blocks are blocked but how the different 
commands are within their own blocks and this is   super helpful if you want to ensure if you want 
to bookmark one of these blocks which we'll show   in a second here as well or if you want to share 
one of these blocks there's so many user friendly   activities that you can do within that and then 
on the side here you can see that there are block   actions sharing and sticky Commander header 
alright let's get into it okay first of all   let's go into a protein now I'm back in warp 
and let's go get into a project so CD desktop   it's on our desktop and then let's see let's do 
project one one I'm terrible at naming my projects   it's just it's just a fact of life let's look 
inside here index okay perfect I don't even know   what project this is because of the bad naming 
it's terrible and one of those offenders who too   often has a crazy messy desktop and then when 
I get tired of looking I just put everything in   documents or in sometimes in the trash I know I'm 
terrible but you can see here already even just   speaking to you we are creating some blocks so we 
have the first one up here going into our project   then looking inside of our project and now in our 
project we haven't created this block yet but the   new blocks are always created at the bottom 
all right this is Tiff coming from the future   I wanted to share that you can actually toggle 
your settings so your blocks start at the top   and Cascade down here's a tweet with a video that 
wart posted a few weeks ago going through this   a really interesting thing as well is if you 
hover over one of these you can see here you   can bookmark this block to quickly scroll to it so 
if there is a command that you are writing often   or something that maybe I know for myself anyways 
when I was working at IBM and a lot of times we're   working on these massive projects right and I was 
on the Consulting side for clients it was around   cherry picking I had to do a few times and I 
struggled with it so much that I would leave   the command I typed it into myself into slack 
bookmarked it in slack and then I would copy   and paste it every time and now it's something 
like this in turn with warp you don't actually   have to make these workarounds they're right here 
in your terminal so so let's have an interesting   command to do for this so say you wanted to 
say get status let's say get status [Music]   not a get repository this has not become a git 
repository yet so say we wanted to make this a   git repository get a net and now we're on 
the head so say we wanted to save I don't   know let's say we want to save this command 
so all you need to do is hover here bookmark   and then if we keep on going all right so you 
can see here I did some more commands uh since   the git commit or get init sorry which is 
bookmark I did get status and then get add   because as I mentioned this was just a little 
project I did I don't even remember exactly   which one I didn't realize that I was adding 
all the node modules which actually worked out   well though because then what happened was 
git add git status and I added all of these   node modules removed all the node modules but in 
turn because this is something that maybe isn't   as common maybe it's not a specific example this 
is common hopefully that often but at the end of   the day the point being is you can see here now 
after making a lot of different commands and using   the terminal a lot if there is a command that I 
have bookmark you can see here it will be booked   Mark a little blue you can hover over it and it 
will show what the command is if you click on it   it will take you right to that which is really 
handy especially for people who are always on   their terminal using it also too something 
that would have come in handy all the time   for me when working on teams is you can actually 
share these blocks so as you can see here if you   toggle to the three dots I think it's called the 
hamburger no hamburger is when it's longer lines   what is the shorter one called when it's just 
three dots not the three lines is it hamburger   still leave in the comments I'm curious now 
you can see here though that you can create   a permalink and share a block with people 
create a link to your blog and share it with   your co-workers or Community this is super handy 
if you are working with more Junior developers   senior developers and you want to share a specific 
command or a block that you have executed for them   super helpful all right one more time I'm coming 
to you from the future or I guess when you watch   this it will be the past but I also wanted to 
highlight that you can create a permalink of   this blog and share it with your team members or 
whomever essentially a shared block is a web page   with the output that has full support for syntax 
highlighting and Link clicking the amount of time   this would have saved me and honestly still saves 
me working on different projects especially for   projects that we're working on together on this 
channel or building uh being able to link them   down below would be really interesting now I'm 
thinking of future project ideas what else should   we be building all right anyways you get the point 
you can share these blocks they're super cool okay   let's talk about the feature I am most excited 
about why because it's getting sucked into all   the hype but it's actually really really handy 
which is warp AI so as I mentioned earlier in   this video that there is this toggle up here and 
you can click on it warp AI why I get so excited   about this is because the amount of time it will 
reduce for me to Google or go on stack Overflow   and just have this right inside my terminal it's a 
game changer and so as you can see when I open it   up it suggests some things that are common such 
as how do I do the most recent commits and get   how do I find all the files containing specific 
text write a script to connect to AWS like it is   so handy so let's do something fun uh you know 
I like to automate things with python a lot of   times so let's do something write a python script 
to uh to find all PNG files in my documents folder all right so as you can see here here is a python 
script that uses the OS and FN match modules to   find PNG files in the doc folders so you can see 
here import the path at the dot the script so   that's pretty cool so now let's say what should 
I do next or you can do show examples how do I   fix this depends on what you want to achieve if 
you have a specific task in mind okay so say how   do I run the above command all right navigate 
to the directory you save the python script   the script in using CD command for example if 
you saved it in the docs folder run the script   using python followed by the name of the script 
file all right let's try this all right so let's   run this I just saved this file main.py name 
dot Pi in my documents folder so let's go back   into documents to let's go CD I guess I could 
have just gone straight into it that's okay so now if I look inside you should be able to 
see foreign she's probably really embarrassing   because there's so much stuff in here but it's 
maine.py here we go so now what we can do is as   it mentions run the script using python followed 
by the name of the script so python main.py this is super cool so it's really messy but you 
can even see when I first this is really cool and   scary how many pngs I have don't judge me or you 
can judge me a little bit I would judge myself a   little I do judge myself a little but the point 
being you can see here that at first I just did   python main.pi I was just kind of going quickly 
didn't work but rather than just being completely   you know stumped at that point it gives a 
suggestion python3 and type it in and there you go   this is a game changer I'm super pumped 
about this all right next let's customize   our terminal and you can get very specific with 
your customizations with warp for this I'm just   going to share with you what comes out of the 
box but honestly it takes about three minutes   to even create your own theme or use one of their 
themes the documentation as I keep on saying is   really good there's also some videos embedded 
in the documentation that you can follow along   but for this just to get a sense of it you can see 
already I changed the color of my terminal and to   do that you can simply navigate to settings here 
go to appearance current theme and then it will   click on that and then you can see a 
bunch of different ones dark light I   know it's burning everyone's eyes with the 
light Dracula solarize that's what I'm on   I kind of like this one too it's kind of vintage 
feeling jellyfish is really cute too so there's so   much that comes right oh I like leafy we're 
doing leafy we're committing to the leaf   so nice it makes me feel like I'm in a tropical 
place even though I'm in the middle of downtown   Toronto so you can see themes can get really out 
of the box very interesting already and then you   can once again go into customizing your own thing 
all right the last thing I want to touch on or   leave with you leave this pass on my wisdom now 
I'm there's no wisdom but the last thing I want to   share with you is really how you can access a lot 
of these commands very quickly so as I mentioned   throughout this video one of the key things when 
you are using a new tool is you want it to just   work you already have enough on your plate and to 
access a lot of these commands within warp all you   need to do is do command p and it will open up 
this panel here where you can search for command   or type to specifically go to one so it's from 
AI to clear selected lines copy all the commands   are right here so this is a great way too when 
you're getting started with warp if you forget   a command or how to do something within warp you 
can easily do command p and it will pull it all up [Music] thank you
