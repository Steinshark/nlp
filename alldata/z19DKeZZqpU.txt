ladies and gentlemen if you're fans of Chess then you are probably aware of some of the greatest rivalries that have ever existed in our little world I'm talking about Magnus Carlson versus Hikaru Nakamura I'm talking about Gotham chess Yours Truly versus International Master Eric Rosen Anatoly karpov Gary Kasparov played five World Chess championships against each other but perhaps the greatest rivalry of them all culminated a couple of days ago in some games on chess.com of course I am speaking about Andrea BOCES versus the one the only Felix langel AKA x q c actually see the by far the biggest streamer on Twitch uh Andrea botes by far the biggest streamer on botez live probably tied with Alexandra but on this channel we like Andrea botas content and the two of them went Toe to Toe how however there is one big problem with this matchup and it's the fact that they are separated by over 1 000 rating points and so to make it fair Andrea botes played with 20 seconds on the clock 20 seconds and Mr xqc was able to do some incredible things on the chessboard with a full 10 minutes on the clock despite the 900 rating now this video is going to be mildly hilarious but I I do have to give props where it's due Andrea put up a monster fight I mean 19.9 seconds to start the game is not a lot of time I played the protest sisters with 45 seconds it was not a lot of fun the only way Andrea can beat xqc is by Checkmate he can win in a lot of different ways and in the first game that they played he did this which is bad uh he spent you know he played this and he pre-moved taking but she took his Bishop and then she played E6 and then she played D5 and then they traded she developed and developed and took and did all of this and has only spent three seconds can I just say she has a piece up and a great position and has only spent three seconds I'm telling you this is pretty impressive stuff Queen F6 rookie yeah I I don't know what this is uh five seconds on this move uh one Rook is hanging and uh the other one is is taken away I don't know if he was going for tricks excellent job here from Andrea she swarms with the Knights 13 seconds is more than enough time to win this game with black because you can open up the king you can go Bishop G4 you can go Queen H6 Queen H3 so Felix takes Knight takes and uh yeah I mean he or she was pre-moving so if you notice she did not take the queen I mean when you have 11 seconds 12 seconds you don't really expect your opponent to uh play Queen F3 but that's what 900s do and that's completely fine and now she opens up White's King uh and he just doesn't have enough pieces nine seconds is more than enough time to win this game with black you just need to give checks and you need to make sure you don't blunder your queen to the night so she does this which is and and yeah I mean xqc really should not be walking his King forward uh check and now seven seconds is 7.7 seconds bring in the queen and this is pre-movable rookie two Qui and yes she has made in one but this is an easy pre-move and she wins she beat xqc in 13 seconds she played 34 moves in 13 seconds so if you're sitting there going this matchup is not fair oh no it is no this is very much a fair matchup and Andrea was uh was doing some great stuff early she was playing these Sicilians uh E6 it was a Russell limo by the way can I just why is there a Rosa limo Sicilian on the board this is the opening that was played in the World Championship 20 18. Fabiano caruana with white Magnus Carlson with black and now it was played between xqc and Andrea botes I mean seriously chess in 2023 is exceptional stuff you got Fabiano caruana and Magnus Carlson playing an opening and you have xqc and Andrea protest playing an opening uh once again Andrea playing principal chess early uh good awareness here that he can take trying to catch her with pre-moves and now uh this is really sophisticated stuff G5 excellent first of all it's just a good move uh because black has the two Bishops and good attacking chances and uh yeah I mean she just doesn't take her foot off the gas here this is a very bad move by Andrea uh definitely not a good move uh hangs a queen but in her defense she probably thought that her opponent would move the Knight when it was attacked uh so these games are a little bit hilarious of course Knight takes H4 is free 927 xqc thinks for nine seconds and uh sadly does not capture the Queen the queen goes here and uh she takes this and now she is losing here uh but uh she probably anticipated that this would happen it did not so she did not Checkmate xqc instead she blundered Checkmate herself this is perhaps the best moment in the match uh she goes from not having a mate to giving up Maiden one it it's made in one for black and now it's made in one for white single-handedly the greatest turnaround in chess history all right xqc has the white pieces Andrea BOCES has the black pieces xqc blunders Checkmate in one Andrea botez blunders Checkmate and one back heeda doesn't play it despite thinking for 14 seconds on this move and having just played Queen D4 and it's Queen G2 so Andrea was winning this match early on and she was making it look uh she was making it look easy but xqc was not to be denied although in this game Andrea was doing it with white and with black even in an end game I mean you would think that this is not enough time 17 seconds on the clock and all her pieces oh but he gives up that and that that's not good knight C3 Bishop G3 uh-oh uh oh oh no oh no oh automatic and yeah and unfortunately now this is just a nightmare because the Rook can come forward and that is exactly what she does convincing game okay Rook G7 maybe she thought that the King was gonna go there but uh she wins this game in eight seconds she beats xqc in eight seconds eight seconds she beat him Checkmate move 29 Checkmate all he's gotta do is blunder a little bit less and trust me easier said than done uh but it was just a matter of time you know before uh before he would start fighting back and he did he did fight back all right uh Andrea tried to play very aggressive stuff I mean look when you got like wait what happened in this game in this game she gave him 15 seconds 15 seconds I don't know what happened maybe she got delayed on the first move maybe she was like all right I'm gonna try 15 seconds she was having a little bit too much success and uh got a little bit arrogant said you know what I'm gonna give you 15 seconds and um I mean in her defense she's still got a pretty good position xqc kind of got his night trapped in the bishop trapped but she got 11 seconds to win this I don't think it's gonna happen but xqc to his credit did not even beat her on time ah they got to a rook end game that's just the free rook but she probably did not expect her opponent to uh to give it up Rook C5 and uh xqc got his Pawn all the way down got it all the way down and did not even beat his opponent on time uh he checkmated her with Queen A3 Queen A1 and now Queen A3 spotted with two seconds spent very well done it was not going to be a disaster of man I mean he wasn't going to uh to lose every single game however however Andrea botas uh she uh you know she started firing back uh and she was uh even later in the match she was doing very very well she played once again this Gambit with 15 seconds on the clock she went back to it and let me tell you something she learned from the previous game because we have Bishop G Bishop G5 Bishop takes and now this well she spent 0.4 seconds on this xqc took back in seven seconds okay time stamps he gotta take the both of them were anticipating moves by their opponents uh and uh that was a mistake it was definitely a bit of an inaccuracy uh because here Bishop takes D1 but okay that doesn't happen we're just gonna move past that now excellent job here Queen D4 94 folks white to move Checkmate in two moves black just went here attacking your Rook so it's very natural that she only has 12 seconds she plays Rook D1 alright she pre-moves that because she anticipates that Rook D1 but if you had enough time you have a discover check you do not need to defend your Rook all you have to do is find a double check Knight takes F6 you cover these two squares for the king black cannot take the Knight because it's checked black cannot block because it's check it's a very common tactical pattern the King has to slide over and now Queen E8 is Checkmate brutal with the Rook hanging and the night hanging but it's made you Checkmate before your opponent is able to do anything to you now Rook D1 played and xqc actually castled long now let me tell you something right now 12 seconds to beat your opponent in this position what the heck do you do this is what you do you gotta go for the king 12 seconds on the clock she goes here Queen C2 and I love this bishop takes Pawn you are playing a like a 900 right so the 900 given that you have 12 seconds also might Panic a little bit it might be like oh okay well I I'm gonna take that Rook B1 and now folks a very important lesson when it's check remember you don't need to move your king and if you're gonna move your king you gotta move your king the right way you don't need to move your king you can just defend your king and you can defend your king and your king is going to be safe if you're gonna move your king you better do it the right way and xqc does not he plays King C8 had he gone to the corner if white were to give a check there would be C6 blocked and defended but unfortunately he brought the king back naturally toward his other pieces but geometrically defeated by Queen A6 mate she beat xqc in this game in four seconds three point eight seconds on the clock 3.8 she beat this man in 3.8 seconds that's crazy and it was all because he castled and she was I mean castling is fine it's a good move he had to defend himself but this was the that is the way you gotta win you don't set up these cheeky things because they're gonna see that you gotta catch him with these long moves Queen A6 very very nice and uh it was uh it it was some more of that by the way I mean 15 seconds is not a lot of time but look at this E4 and now that he's committed his King she pushes back his pieces she takes and she just brings out the important pieces like this and is like all right I got 11 seconds I gotta go for it Knight G4 Bishop G4 geometric Queen trap very well known Queen trap everything is stuck and uh she gets this and he doesn't take that's kind of the he slips I guess had he taken I mean breaking through that position in eight seconds is not easy probably H5 H4 you gotta go here try to open it up like this and take and but it's I mean listen if white starts fighting back against your king with eight seconds not easy but he goes here and she does in fact do this and once her Rook is in the game it's gonna be bad news uh she plays Rook H7 Queen F5 seven seconds to go it's not over it is not over Queen H5 but the king runs how are you gonna beat the king in six seconds check here Knight D5 I mean four seconds on the clock no way right King D1 takes with check King here Rook H1 and xqc had to take the Rook or take the Knight which one do you take I mean naturally you take the Rook right but he had just moved his King here so his mind was on taking the Knight and in a tragic turn of events she goes here and with two seconds remaining she wins the game now the most epic moment in this entire match uh was uh was the following the following two games so Knight C3 Knight C6 this was early in the match she was giving him uh I think they went this was uh 30 seconds on the clock and um D4 Bishop B7 Pawn takes Pawn takes look at these Bishops I mean this is like you could actually learn from this I mean yes it's completely ridiculous time odds but right you can still learn from this queen D5 danger levels ignoring the threat on the bishop all this is coming here F3 nice but that's no longer defended because the pawn got in the way so she takes takes and cleans up here which brings the Bishops back and a nice job here Bishop F3 she should have done it in a more flashy way with Queen F3 Rook F3 and like this and uh it was a very back and forth match but uh the next game is um was was definitely the most hype uh it was this one and this one was legendary xqc began this game with a Spanish Bishop C5 takes takes 95 now you got 14 seconds on the clock right what do you do Andrea very keen opens up White's King again because a begin well he's not a beginner I mean he's an advanced beginner early intermediate but you can't always be trusted to guard your king the right way right you just can't so Queen F6 you can protect this and this by coming back but when you have tunnel vision right you're like okay I gotta guard my king I don't want to move my king I'm gonna go here black does this now xqc goes D4 and she had probably pre-moved getting her Queen out of the center because she thought it was going to get attacked so the queen drops back and now she plays D6 and he sneaks in this now she's gotta find a way to guard her Rook she does Queen trade right 11 seconds on the clock I mean we've seen crazy stuff so check King G3 and now this and once again she is winning but she's only got 11 seconds on the clock how is she gonna pull this off she gets out of the way but unfortunately forgets about this she probably should have pre-moved Knight H5 but she goes here and he cleanly picks up the night and is just looking like he's gonna run away with it now here's something really hilarious happens uh she goes King f8 he plays H4 she's pre-moving right she's trying to rookie eight he takes she goes here right so she is attacking this Pawn trying to get her Rooks right and the bishop there are ways to lose this with white absolutely he goes King F4 defending everything it's the best game that excuse he played in the whole match he was on fire Knight E4 and now something absolutely ridiculous happened xqc was like I have to play against her clock she has eight seconds right so I'm just gonna make random moves I'm gonna just make random moves and I'm gonna win she plays D5 she's pre-moving she pre-moves D5 that allows xqc to play Knight C5 right A Move ago if she had played D5 he would have not been able to go he or she would have taken if she spotted it because of the time she goes here now Andrea was pre-moving again notice her she spent point one so she pre-moved this and in a tragic turn of events she pre-move this and xqc took the bishop the game ended and he went nice I won on time but she got eight seconds he didn't win on time he accidentally walked his Knight into a checkmate the king is surrounded by his Rooks but they are useless in guarding against the Knight and this is covered as well that's boss stuff that is some seriously boss stuff I I would love it if I could accidentally Checkmate some Grand Masters you know what I mean this was uh this was a very very fun match uh credit to Andrea obviously putting herself through 32nd 20 second 15 second time odds it was a close fight I think xqc won in the end I think they played something like uh one two three four five six seven eight not like 20 games and he won like 12 of them 12 or 13 of those games I mean though 20 seconds on the clock clock credit to her she won like seven that is not easy so xqc taking down Andrea boethas look at that now get out of here
