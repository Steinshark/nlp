going to laugh until our stomachs hurt we're going to cry because the moves hurt our eyes but most importantly we're going to have a good time some of you watching this are rated 200 some of you watching this are rated 3,200 okay because we all know the human EMB bodymen of stockfish watches these videos as well uh sit back relax and enjoy this absolute catastrophe uh and today's video is sponsored by nobody so there you go uh but if you want to like you know get a course or the books you know it's it's all there for you all right so the players receive honorary Grandmaster titles our battle is uh happening between an Australian and a Greek player 684 693 I guess I could have rounded up to 700 but they're 600 their first number is a six all right I hate the first move of the game white plays are ready okay wow that is interesting stuff not putting a pawn in the center uh White develops the night first fine you know what maybe I don't hate it um it's stops black from playing E5 now uh ladyi from Greece plays C6 the the only reason I can imagine that black Begins the game with the move C6 uh is because black thought that they were going to get a caroon like maybe they thought C6 I you know so they just assume everything is a caroan you teach person they use a hammer they think everything is a nail um not everything is a caroan caroan is only against E4 now white immediately plays a queen's Pawn which is fine and now of course black should play D5 and take the center but black plays a giga super caroon okay um yeah you know there's a reason you don't see Grand Masters playing like this and you six and 700s need to stop inventing your own openings you you you don't know how to play chess okay so maybe just like put a pawn in the center and then Knights because now you blocked in your bishop and you blocked in the Knight this is just really bad white play C4 excellent stuff here from croo which actually rhymes with Bozo this is great and now you're going to go Knight here and Bishop here and and you know it's not too late I mean this is still a very real opening it's called the triangle defense uh but black plays Queen A5 check now that is a really really bad move um that is just a really bad move uh that is there's no if sand or buts I mean that is just developing a queen for absolutely no reason now if in chess checks were not forced to be defended for example right now chess.com won't even let me make this move you see how it it's like telling me I'm in check I think you should be able to take the king so I think you should allow people to play moves like this and get their kings taken that's just my but not when it has to be stopped I mean this now the Queen's got to move again and if it doesn't move again you got to play Bishop B4 and then white shouldn't even trade Bishops why'd you just develop and then kick you out so this is just not any good but you know black has only one major idea here and it's to play Queen B6 and attack that pawn clearly this has worked for the 700 in the past so he is playing like this uh but but but this is just terrible uh just something like Bishop C3 defending the pawn or Pawn to B3 defending the pawn or queen to C2 defending the pawn or queen to C1 defending the pawn or A3 which loses the pawn now what could have even been the idea of this move like what you know black moved the queen out and then clearly you know the queen goes here you got to ask what is the queen doing there it's got eyes on that and that's defended and that's probably where white stopped but you got another Pawn I mean you got eight pawns you know the the queen anyway A3 Queen takes B2 now the reason that white is still better here and not losing is that after something like Knight to C3 white has what we call compensation so you're down upon Pawn but you have compensation in the form of more Central Pawn space way more development than black that's what compensation is it's like you know you know certain men compensate for being inadequate in certain ways of life by driving really loud and big vehicles that look intimidating that is called compensating you're compensating for something that you don't have black does not have any development or Central Pawn space but black has an extra Pawn now black plays Queen B6 and I like white next's move I don't mind white next's move pushing a pawn and taking a little bit of space and now the queen goes back to d8 now black has the exact same position on move seven as they did on move two look at Black's position on move seven and move two it's the exact same position but the queen went out did some damage went back and went back the queen has made one two three four and five moves in the first seven moves that's not the way you're supposed to play chess it's just not it's not the way you're supposed to play chess now I love white snack's move Pawn to E4 great move take as much Central space as you can get the bishop out Castle black I is really not planning for the long term here all right really not planning for the long term black is uh got a little bit of money in the bank and is and is gambling it away on Meme stocks okay it's not investing in an index fund tracker like Vu okay that tracks the like it's you know it's just gambling away on Meme stocks now it's time to take it advantage of the white position and Play Moves Like Pawn to D6 and slowly break out black plays B5 that is a terrible move uh that's a terrible move because it does nothing it does nothing it it does not improve any of your situation and white doesn't even know about Onan so like it's not like white is going to take and open up your position it's just not a good move you should have went B6 that's what you should have done because that actually would have forced white to do something B5 is a terrible move uh and that is why now after Bishop D3 white enjoys an advantage think about this white is down a pawn but has a plus one advantage that's two points that's a two-point turnaround and the reason for that is white has way more space much better pieces white is going to Castle and black doesn't follow it up with a with a with a good move at all black plays A5 that that is awful and now it's one and a half the advantage is one and a half black hates playing normal chess I mean but somebody's got to give black an opening course cuz this ain't it this is not how chess should be played okay White Castles excellent I have no complaints now black finally attacks the center what black should have done here is forced a trade of Pawns forced one where white can't do anything because after takes you know the bishop is going to get out and if you don't take black takes right black is going to take D5 does does not force a pawn trade if white didn't know about alasan there white is obviously not going to go there and now white plays an excellent move Pawn to E5 I love this move the computer doesn't but the computer can eat a Frank Pawn takes D5 is the best choice for the computer because it wants to open up Black's King I get it but I like this move because black is so restricted and now black plays F6 and Black's in a lot of trouble now why is black in a lot of trouble this move looks natural because you want to trade all of your pieces are on the back rank y'all you can't play chess like this are you crazy it's the 12th move of the game if you allow your opponent to stomp on you like this by the time you start peeking your head out they're just going to be click click all your pieces are going to be gone I love white next's move by the way you know what it is the computer wants to take I love white next's move Rook to E1 that is how I know that white has a future in chess in this position white just brings The Rook to the E file every other piece has gotten a turn Rook e one is a great move preparing for the opening of the position if black takes you can take with the Rook or the Knight this is definitely the best move because you apply pressure and you open up the door for your queen now white starts hammering away Knight to H6 and I told you the second that black starts peing their head out of the position with this Monumental Advantage what you have to do is smash into the black position Bishop takes H6 the best move as far as I'm concerned the best move Pawn takes now the queen can go to H5 I keep looking around because there's like a weird noise in my apartment there's like a weird mechan well you know what I guess I'm going to solve that after I record this video you can't hear it but I can can't tell if it's coming from above or below sounds like somebody's spraying their ceiling with a water gun like I I don't know anyway uh this is an excellent move by white damaging Black's Pawn structure the king is extremely weak all of Black's pieces are still on the back rank I hate White's next move though G3 not a good move not a good move we got to open up the door for our Queen we got to go Knight H4 or we got to take and play Knight E5 that's what we got to do we got to put Knight in the center I don't hate this move the good news is on the very next turn white does that pawn takes and puts the Knight on E5 fantastic chess this attacks that if that falls that falls if that falls that falls The Rook has pressure here black is still up a pawn but it's a horrible position black is in a very very very bad position here all right and completely misses White's point and now white crash is in Knight takes C6 excellently played by white fantastic I have absolutely no complaints the queen goes to C7 and now white immediately follows it up with taking this Pawn defending the Knight and setting up a discovered attack now this is what black gets this is exactly how you exploit a position where an opponent doesn't develop their pieces leaves their King in the center and has a bunch of weaknesses white plays Bishop takes B5 spectacular you know what else you can do in this position for white as you get better at chess you're going to do things called setting traps you're going to set a trap making that move not possible you're going to play a move like Queen C2 your opponent is going to go here thinking you're stupid and now you win a queen so in chess you might go oh my Knight's hanging oh no it's not no it's not if they take I can play Bishop takes and then I'm pitting the queen to the king you have to be able to set these things up it's how you set a trap in chess but I don't hate this move at all now black plays Bishop A6 looking to exchange Bishop to A6 is a decent idea there's a problem though there's a problem because that Bishop used to guard that pawn and as a human you're going to get your eyes drawn over here so it's only fitting that a 600 would play this move and that kind of get their Knight a little bit stuck now their Knight has to go back to E5 but that's not what happened in this game in this game the 684 realized that the bishop no longer guards the pawn and hook on E6 oh my now black has to move the king to f8 or to F7 and black chooses the wrong move and white wins the queen oh my oh my take take take oh my goodness white is completely winning white is up a queen now for a few pieces for sure you got a bishop a knight you got a bishop and a knight you got a rook you got a rook it's a queen for a rook and a bishop but you have a pass pawn and a butt naked king king's not wearing any clothes stumbling around bumbling around drunk as can be the queen should now give this check why this check because it hits the king and it gives a boost to the bishop so anywhere the king moves you take there is a difference because if you take like this and then give a check the Rook will block you're not going to win the bishop but you are still winning but you don't win the bishop instead of that white played Queen E1 check and now a little lesson if you're in a game like this and you have 156 versus 258 you got to speed up you got to make simple moves make simple moves make quick moves that get into the position Bishop takes Rook you should not have spent 22 seconds on Bishop takes Bishop you gotta H you got to bring the Rook or you got to do a little sneak attack Rook B1 excellent Rook back to A7 here comes the Knight Galloping into the position Rook E7 and the queen immediately takes the Knight goes to G4 the Knight gallops in looking to take on D5 but here comes counterplay and in this position unfortunately disaster strikes white completely panics forgets that they are under a little bit of pressure they should obviously continue taking there is nothing scary here but they play Rook to E1 which is a massive mistake 600 ELO chess Bish Bish takes F2 and white has lost the rook and now black is back in business still there are winning opportunities here for white because the king is so weak and The Rook can't really mate the king so Knight takes D5 oh my goodness white has lost it [Music] all in two moves white loses the rook and the queen 15 points of material gone like that oh 700 600 ELO chest is so crazy white played like Magnus Carlson and then white played like Carlos Magnuson absolutely tragic and white is down a minute and a half so a lot of people would resign white decides to play until check bait Pawn to C6 that b I thought that pawn was going to sneak through but it's over wow nice job by black king D5 Rook F6 the Knight goes to give a check the Rook slides in uh okay black loses the bishop but black is you know still going to win these pawns over here Rook G it's nice and clean and now you can just sacrifice the rook and promote uh black of course brings the I mean bringing the Knight pack is also going to stop the pawn you also have like Knight C5 stuff Pawn to A6 and uh but what black allows the only PA black allows the only Pawn on the board remaining while up a full minute to become a queen you just had to bring the Rook around or around there this was not complicated the the literally only has one type of move it can only move forward a square how did Black do this why did you just move the Knight for one of the moves at that point you must have realized wait a minute I can't actually stop the pawn so now I just got to get to the a file how did you decide to do this you spent 20 seconds on that move how did you forget I don't understand I I just don't how did you do that how did you do that you can go literally anywhere Rook C5 Rook D5 Rook F any move that gets to the last rank any move oh my God it's over white is going to win probably it's a draw according to the computer but look at this I mean this is unbelievable oh my God and white has 29 second but is white going to figure this out with 29 seconds on the clock 96 discover check now he just got to make sure you don't get forked no forks no skewers okay no forks no skewers Rook H5 check the king forward Black's got to find a way to defend themselves The Rook the king and the Knight all have to be close together if they're far apart the queen is going to pick them off Rook B5 oh my goodness this is terrifying now Queen A3 wins the night Queen h8 will probably win material Queen A4 okay very scary everything is defended though now black plays H5 now black plays H5 white has to give a check or get to the Knight you got to get to the Knight because the Knight is protecting The Rook you got to win The Rook in this position white play Queenie for check and hangs the queen in one move oh it hangs the queen in one move black has 39 seconds on the clock and bl [Music] G oh my God oh my God now you can take the Knight and then you have made on the back rank in a couple of moves you also can play Queen takes H S and made on that move that's exactly what white does 8.6 seconds remaining black has a rook black has a knight but they're all hanging they are all hanging and mate is right there black plays King to C8 saving Queen D7 but now Queen C7 is made and any of those is madeen two and white instead of doing that plays King takes D6 the Knight has been removed and now Queen C7 is a Checkmate 6 seconds remaining the final opportunity Rook to B6 check a really clutch move now white has to step backwards but with 6 seconds on the clock white goes here loses the game
