if you open up device manager in windows you'll see a huge number of hardware components that make up your pc and the vast majority of them require drivers those pieces of software that sit between your components and your operating system so that software can talk to your hardware correctly and you've likely been told that it's very important to keep your drivers updated but is that really necessary considering just how many components need them i mean that sounds like a lot of work and you've got better things to do anyway let's break it down starting with your gpu if there's only one driver you ever bother updating on your pc it should probably be this one as game developers keep trying to make their titles look more impressive by adding support for newer technologies having the most recent gpu drivers can make a real difference in both your game's appearance as well as your frame rates this can include enabling or enhancing support for features like nvidia's dlss on certain titles and g-sync on certain monitors or amd's super resolution and freesync if you have a card from team red even if you're just using your processor's built-in graphics driver updates can still boost performance in certain games and enable greater control over your display settings as well as fix weird graphical bugs that don't have an obvious solution you know the ones but what about the rest of your system there are a few cases in which it's a good idea to make sure you're downloading the specific drivers for that component from the manufacturer rather than using the default windows drivers but tonight might not be as important to continually update them one good example is your chipset this is a chip that handles much of your system's input output or i o without correct chipset drivers you may find that some of your ports or onboard devices don't work quite as intended sometimes they'll show up as components with error notifications on them in device manager for example over the years windows has gotten better about auto installing drivers for the chipset but even now you'll definitely want to pick up the official chipset driver from amd intel or your motherboard's manufacturer to ensure all your components are enabled properly chipset drivers can even offer added functionality such as the different power options amd provides with chipsets for its zen 2 cpus and the good thing is that after you do this once updating it again isn't as critical as it is with the gpu we'll tell you more right after we thank monday.com for sponsoring this video they just launched a new beta work docs feature for recording your team's notes and ideas their real time engine allows hundreds of people to work together without anyone's work being overwritten their text is made of blocks so you can even embed live objects and connect work docs to your workflows allowing your team to run everything in one unified space sign up for a one month trial at the link below another driver that you might want to take a few minutes to install yourself is the audio driver these days those real tech chip sets that come integrated into motherboards play along just fine with the default windows drivers but custom drivers from your motherboard manufacturer can give you other features that are really useful such as controlling amplification levels or allowing the front and back audio ports to be treated as two separate devices really convenient if you like to leave your headphones plugged in but still use the desktop speakers and of course you'll definitely want to install custom drivers if you've splurged on an expensive add-in sound card finally any other components that might not be an integral part of the standard pc will benefit from having the official drivers installed i'm talking about webcams aio liquid coolers and anything that uses rgb official drivers will again give you greater control such as focus options for a camera or custom fan curves for a cooler but unlike with graphic drivers it isn't super critical that you update chipset audio or peripheral drivers religiously that being said if you're experiencing issues with any of these components or if there's news of a security hole definitely check for an updated driver as there's at least a decent chance a recent driver release will contain bug fixes and security patches and we'd be remiss if we didn't mention firmware while firmware and drivers are two different things it can still be important to update your system firmware in certain circumstances probably the best known example of computer firmware is the bios which is the basic code that your motherboard needs to start up and communicate with the other components while it typically isn't crucial to grab every bios update as soon as it's released it can be a good idea to do the update if it's necessary for upgrading to a new os or processor to fix the security vulnerability or to unlock a new feature as we've seen on recent motherboards that support resizable bar for graphics cards for example other components also contain firmware notably discrete graphics cards and ssds again firmware updates for these components can fix bugs and sometimes even improve performance but i wouldn't lose sleep if you haven't installed the latest version recently tldr keep your gpu drivers up to date install the official drivers for your other components and just check back for a new version if you're having a problem or need a feature update but don't expect new drivers to perform miracles like expand the capacity of
