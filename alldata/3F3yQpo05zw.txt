- Whoa. Okay. - [Man] Yeah. - It's just, we're good. I just going to tip it a little. Okay. And is anything going to fall off? Oh, okay. Hold on. Okay. That's it. That's the final step. My desk PC is done. Eight drops of PTNEW copper sulfate. We are bio-sided up. A little bit more water to top it up. That's it. (hands clapping) Let's go. Ah, I'm so excited because not only am I
getting my new desk today, I am getting a whole new setup. A new monitor, new peripherals. I'm stoked. Are you having poor

- Yep. - You good?
- Yep. - Oh God, it's hard to lift that high. How are your shins doing? - I'm fine. - Okay. Where's the step? There it is. Okay. - That's the edge. - Hold on, I fell off the step. - Don't do that, watch the edge. - Okay, I'm good. - Oh, the other way. - Oh, God. - Come on Linus. - Ah! - How are we going to get in the? - Yeah, which door is this going in? - We should have thought this through. - I'm actually, this is not like drama played
up for the camera, actually. We, our doors are really thick. Hold on. - They can't. - No, not a chance. No. - Hmm? - Okay, if I did my job right, this will be 32 inches. Which it is. And what's? Now this is, okay we are
going to from the bar, which is like the tightest point, like 32 and seven eighths. - Okay. - I don't know, man. - I think we're going to make it. - I give it a 50% chance. - I think we're going to make it. - Okay. - 50%. - We're going to have to
lift it up over that foot. - 50% is a pass in many programs. - But is it, though? - Yeah. Would you want your pharmacist to know what drugs do 50% of the time? Ooh, ah, hold on, wait. Did not consider the lifting mechanism in our width measurement. - Nope, nope, no dice, dude. - No, hold on. Maybe we could, is it past? - Well, almost. - Oh no. - No. - It's not going to make it. - No. - Crap. Okay, wait. - We've got to go all the way to 101. - What? No, we don't, no, we don't, no. - What, are we going to use another door? They're all the same size. - We can go in there. One of the hidden tricks
of the short circuit set is that bookshelf is actually on wheels so that we can open up the bay door and bring through like a
pallet if we really needed to. - Let me in. - Here we go. - Do we want to swap you
out for a stunt double to go up the stairs? - I didn't say I can't do it. Is that a challenge? - Yes. - I got this. Stunt double? Rude! - Hey, man. - Hey, James. - Its not a dig on you. - Speaking of stunt doubles, he was a deep fake actor for me once. Hey. Okay, should we actually
grab two more people though? - Yeah. - Okay, just making sure. Okay, so, James and, ooh. - [Man] Wow. - [Colton] Hey, Linus, how you doing? - Yeah, could you hold
the camera for David? (laughing) - [Man] Yeah, oh, wow. - Just so you know, Colton. - [Colton] Yeah? - There's only one of
these in the universe, so. - [Colton] How much is it worth? - Please don't break it. - [Colin] Too much. - Are you guys good? - Yeah, oh yeah. - Okay. - [Colton] I'm doing
that thing where I think all three of you have like 90%
of it and I've got like 10. - Okay. Oh, God. Okay. Can we put it down? - Yeah. - Here we go. Last door. Oh, shoot, I put my hands
right at the very edge. Are we stuck on something? Is this door narrower? - Sure hope not. - Okay. Oh. Oh my God, it's so much, why does it feel like
it takes up less space? Is it smaller? - [Colin] No, it's much larger. - Oh, I guess it's just
that it's not so thick. - [Colin] Yeah. - Like crazy, dumb thick. Oh, that's cool, ah. - It was definitely one C thickness. - One. Thanks for that. Got to clean this off. You don't mind me being here do you? - No, it's okay. - Now that it's clean, we can
only hold it by the edges, which should be fine. - This is fine. (grunting) - Oh God, I just put it in my way. (grunting) - Okay, let's put it down like an inch in. - Mm-hmm. - And then we'll drop it and slide it. - Okay. - Okay? - Mm-hmm. - And then we can touch up
any fingerprints on this side. - Sure. - Okay? - Okay. I mean, my side's good, I think. Oh no, I got one there. Yup, I'm good. lttstore.com. Look at that, a cleaning rag you can wear. Oh wow, we're wearing the same shirt. - Oh, well, that's awkward. Someone's going to have to change. (laughing) - Oh. Uh, we left a Q-tip in. (laughing) - [Colin] Crap. (laughing) - No, I'm not keeping that in there. Also, I need to grab a Sharpie. I scratched the paint a little bit here. Come here little Q-tip. - [Colin] And also maybe
make the RGB look good. - Yeah. Hold on. Just gonna, okay. Um, that made it worse. - [Colin] That made it way worse. It popped out. - Hold on, I got the. Is it, ouch. Is it improved? - [Colin] It's, yeah,
it's fine enough for now. - Okay. (laughing) I mean, hey, if that's all
the damage on the way up here. - Good as new. - We're doing pretty well. - Oh, finger! - Ow, finger. (grunting) I'm almost as excited
about the new monitor as I am about the new desk. I've been saying for a long time that these 48 inch LGO LEDs are
just fantastic as a monitor, whether it's for productivity,
gaming, whatever. But because I upgraded to two
32 by nine displays stacked on top of each other, right before these things came out, it felt pretty stupid to
immediately upgrade unless I was also making some other changes. - [David] We have to lay it down. Yeah. - Oh, do we? - [David] Yeah, yeah, it's
not one that clips in. - Oh, so it isn't? Oh crap. - Well, I'm glad it's holding
all the weight of the TV without collapsing. - Yeah, that's good. - So, that's a start, ain't it? - That's an important
milestone for our product here. - [David] You need to
have it off the edge. - Yeah, I think we did actually
do need to lay it down. - Hold on, I got this. - Oh, geez. - [David] Why don't you
just put it on the box? - Yeah. - It's okay, I got it. - God, Linus. - I will be your table. - [Man] I will be your table, baby. Do, do, do, do. - What? - Oh, God, It's a lot
heavier with that on it. - Mm-hmm. You got that screw driver? - It's in my back pocket. - Yeah, that's unfortunate. - Okay, yup. That's not uncomfortable. Oh God, it's so much heavier now. - You're going to have to hold
it for a little while there. - I'm gonna put a little bit
of the weight on that screw. (grunting) Man, I'm not even going to
have to gain at home anymore. I'll just stay at the office all the time. Update time. I managed to find a LTT desk pad. And are you ready for that dongle trade? - Yup, there you go. - Okay, and that's what
we were using for testing. It's going to be swapped out for a Logitech Pro Superlight. The first thing I'm going
to do, okay, hold on, I'm going to do it now. First thing I'm going to do. - [Colin] Oh, monitor
is not plugged in yet. - Oh, gosh darn it. Isn't it? - [David] Is that an HDMI2? - [Colin] No, I just need the HDMI2. - Oh. (beeping) First thing I'm going to do is just slide into my desk and not wing my knees on
the super thick thing here. Like I can actually, look at this. (gasping) I can get the arms of
my chair under my desk if I really want to. Four years. Four years, I've not been able to do that. Oh, watch this, watch this. This is the second thing I'm going to do. I'm going to turn my chair
and get out of my desk. (laughing) It was, it was so inconvenient. Okay. Let's power it on, let's see
if it made the trip up here. Oh, (indistinct), no. Oh. Oh, boy. Don't worry, we got this. We got this, dude. - [Colin] There's like three
extensions on that button. - Mm-hmm. Oh, maybe they just got, like. - [Colin] Yeah. - Loosened. - [Colin] That's what I'm thinking. - Acc-i-ma-dent-ally. Let's have a look here. A quick way to test where
the problem lies is to just lift up the glass a little bit (grunting) and then short these with a screwdriver. Oh wow. The motherboard is just not starting. - [Colin] The only thing
that I can think of that would be different is
I plugged in this cable. - Okay. I unplugged the power, plugged it back in and
it immediately lit up. I'm not complaining, but
I'm a little confused. So let's try turning it off, then. - [Colin] Oh, okay. - Yeah, power button works just fine. Everything is fine. You look like everything is fine. Look at him. - Do I look like everything is fine? - Yeah, you totally look
like everything's fine. Everything's fine. Whee! Are you having fun yet? - So much fun. (laughing) - Oh, so stressful. - Yeah, let's do the plug before it gets tucked up against the wall. - Oh, yeah, for sure. Oh, yeah, I guess I might as
well do networking as well, since I'm back here. - Fair. We might as well just
cover up that hard earned LTT logo with a desk pad. (laughing) - Oh. Freaking sick. Oh. So good. We didn't peel the cover
on the chip set fan. - [Colin] No! - We actually have to
take the glass off again. - [Colin] No. - That's a vent hole. We actually do have to. I'm sorry. (sustained grunting) Then I get to play games on it, right? - [Colin] Yeah. - Okay. And there we go. - [Colin] Happy chip set. Oh yeah, make sure that's plugged in. - I mean, this is just routine now. We could do this six more times. - [Colin] All day long. - I cannot express how
exciting it is for me to be able to actually pull my chair all the way up to my desk. So quiet, too, compared to the old one. I didn't even notice the noise 'cause it's just not noticeable. Yeah, I can actually hear
the HVAC in my office now. It's so quiet. It wants a gig and a half of
VRAM to enable array tracing. Okay, well, DLSS, I guess. Quality DLSS doesn't quite get us there. No, it won't let me do it. Balanced? - [David] Oh, so close. - Really? Performance? Are you kidding me? Yeah, well I wanted a higher end card. Colin wouldn't let me have it. Oh, wow, that, that done messed it up. (man laughing) Look at that delay. So, what are we getting? Like, 75 FPS or so? Or anywhere from 75 to 100? Yeah, I think I could get used to this. I don't even want to do real work now. Now I just want to sit at my
desk and play video games. Of course, this video is not
about what it sounds like. The whole point of doing
a final part of this is to really show it off properly. So without further ado, it's glam-tage time. (electronic dance music) So that's it. We know it took a long time. I know it took a long time. Colin, thank you. I am so happy with my new desk and I am so happy to tell
