ladies and gentlemen welcome back to the World Chess Championship 2023 contested by of Russia and ding Legend of China it's currently game number 11 out of their best of 14 match and after 10 games leads five and a half to four and a half we're in crunch time folks there are only four games remaining both individuals will be getting two games with the white pieces and the black pieces and ding needs to strike back also have you noticed that during the World Championship all of my thumbnails have been utterly ridiculous and I have seen your complaints well here's actually why I did that when this match began I started the Recaps as any normal person would I would put Ding and nepo on the thumbnails and I named them World Championship begins world championship game two and so on those videos performed horribly in fact they performed about 30 to 40 percent worse than my average video they weren't getting recommended to people and to the people that weren't that they were getting recommended to they just weren't clicking on them so I decided what if I did something ridiculous for games three and four what if I put some thumbnail like and then I just put a bunch of brilliant symbols I got news for you those videos got 400 000 more views on average you know folks I am fully aware of just how ridiculous some of my thumbnails look I am fully aware I'm sacrificing my dignity and some of them with with my facial expressions but that's what gets recommended to people and that's what gets clicked on and to be honest with you I would much rather have the 300 to 400 000 views per video and sacrifice a little bit of Integrity because the truth is it's really hard to repackage the same content 14 times in two weeks World Chess Championship Game 11 12 13. that stuff just stops getting recommended at some point anyway I figured I would use this as an intro because I'm also getting tired of it but it's what's working I don't really know what to do alright so it's kind of my apology to all of you like sometimes you if you're a long time viewer of my content you know that if you you just click it's gonna be good but the thumbnail for some reason it just has to look like a you know like a like a freak Show circus act anyway that's neither here nor there um yeah newborn machine in this game is plain white and uh Jan in this match has had tremendous success with the move E4 he played one game of D4 we don't talk about it um he plays E4 there was one game that Ding played the French and uh the French in a World Chess Championship was something that you play one time and then never play again uh and instead he plays the move Pawn to E5 which he knows best has been playing his whole life and once again we have Knight F3 we have Knight C6 and we don't have an Italian but in fact we have a Spanish now there was one game um actually the most recent game where ding played Knight F6 didn't play to Berlin and I was actually predicting another Berlin uh because it's a relatively non-forcing line uh and uh you can sort of predict what Jan is gonna do he's gonna play D3 and I sort of figured I don't know I figured ding would go back to this but but ding probably went back to his other Spanish after patching up a few holes and patching up a few question marks uh and so the bishop Retreats and we have Knight F6 attacking the pawn castles Bishop E7 you will remember or maybe not in game one of this match Jan took this Knight uh you will also remember that Jan has played a few games of D3 well we are back to D3 maybe not a few games maybe just one game they've played so many spanishes but we are back to D3 and D3 is what's known as an anti-marshall I mean it's game 11 at this point you should kind of be following along you should know that if we have rookie one if we have B5 Bishop here Castle C3 uh basically ding is trying to play D5 and maybe we will get a marshall at some point but I really don't think so uh I I really don't think it's gonna happen because Jan is trying to avoid the Marshall and I mean also Magnus plays the Marshall and when Jan played Magnus he was also playing like random anti-martials so instead we have D3 we have B5 Bishop B3 kicking out the bishop you actually have to kick out the bishop because if you just Castle uh now you just completely lose the pawn in E5 and you were just losing so you have to play B5 Bishop here uh D6 and A3 now we have our first new position of the mesh this might be completely meaningless to you but in the other game that we had from this position young played C3 and then uh it was it was a game of H3 and A4 a pretty big sideline pretty pretty big sideline and he went for an anti-martial approach that had been tested very few times it was tested by ferrugia uh and in that game ding had a few chances to equalize but he was unable to and Yan won I mean it wasn't some sort of like miraculous you know like uh cutting-edge game of chess or anything but young played a very very nice game ding had a few chances to hold on he he missed them and so Jan won but once you play C3 you're kind of not going to go back there the only two other approaches here the only other approach rather is for white to play A4 it's always kind of a question mark of when white white wants to play A4 uh I believe uh A4 is within Jan's uh toolbox but instead he plays A3 not only does he play A3 and I've talked about this move before uh the point of A3 is to put the Knight here make room for the bishop and also play on The Queen side in the future with b4a4 uh this is a very popular move I actually think it's one of the main ideas in this position uh A3 it's very trendy nowadays and not to mention uh this setup was played by Yan against ding in 2020 in the candidates tournament and didn't want and John won with white so very very bad memories potentially for ding now they've played this since but they played it in online rapid events but they have had this position quite a bit that game in the candidates preceded castles this is the candidates game I'm showing you now this is not the game that happened today Knight C3 Knight A5 Bishop A2 Bishop E6 right so notice how ding has not moved his C pawn and notice how ding castled three years ago and it was B4 take take and essentially Yan got his Knight on on the D5 square like this and uh ding tried to fight back and it was a very complex game but he ended up losing well you'll notice as I said no C pawn and he castled today ding plays Knight A5 right away and now instead of castling he plays C5 so this is very interesting this sort of how chess is developed you know somebody plays A3 right black bunch of Grandmasters play castles play Knight A5 Bishop E6 and then and then they're all faces uh unpleasant uh situation on the board and one of them is like why do I have to Castle I mean what if I just don't rush castling like what if I take the setter with my Pawn alright so this is a new approach from ding I mean it's not a new approach like it's never been played before but he's just doing it in a in a slightly different move order um and so Jan continues with his plan and in case it's not clear why does not playing a traditional Spanish approach with c3d4 which is very common instead white is going here with just a very very clear objective of putting a piece on D5 and trying to win the game that way and we saw this set up very similar setup occur in their other game earlier in this match uh we have Bishop E6 of course now it would be a catastrophe to take in chess there is a concept uh in chess there's an advanced concept that I'd like to share with you right now it's called superseding Concepts that's what I like to call it it's when you've been taught something and you have something in your head but there's another something that actually ranks a little bit above that so you might have been taught double pawns are bad boom boom Oh double pawns look I can attack it it's so weak no actually in this position black can defend the doubled pawn and by capturing the bishop on E6 you actually completely lost control of the D5 Square so even though doubled pawns are good in theory in this particular position it's not worth taking the bishop on E6 just because you saw in some YouTube videos somewhere the double pawns are bad not all double pawns are bad in fact some double pawns are very good especially if they can be well protected so instead of that Jan plays Bishop G5 and the very very simple idea here is to play takes and put something on D5 I mean in a nutshell that is essentially what it is now personally I find this position to be extremely uncomfortable for black I mean I really hate allowing my opponents to have such an outpost I really wish my pawns could go backwards okay so Knight to D5 uh I cannot move my Pawn back to C6 I'm gonna have to rely on my forward counter play uh we have G6 here from ding uh making room for his Bishop on G7 and also maybe in the future he will play F5 Maybe not maybe his Bishop will just go to the diagonal but at least it's out of the way uh Jan plays Queen to D2 this actually does have a threat the threat of Queen to D2 you might think is take the Knight oh wait no that's protected oh it's to go here no uh it's very important to make sure that you are seeing every single piece interaction on the board friendly or opposing this is opposing this is friendly the queen cannot support two pieces at the same time on two diagonals so the threat is Knight takes Bishop Queen takes Knight right that is the Tactical threat to take and then to take all right so Bishop G7 now the bishop moved and took its eye off G5 so now white can play Knight to G5 is that winning no it's no I mean it's move 15 in a world championship match I would hope somebody is not in a losing position already because then I would demand a refund um I have to turn off my radiator before it starts hissing like a rattlesnake my uh my radiator is extremely annoying which if you don't know at this point I've been recording videos from this place for about a year now you're in a couple of months typical steam radiator of New York Knight to G5 now is it a threat to take the bishop now well perhaps for example H6 take take that pawn is certainly weak how exploitable is it it's another question right I mean rookie eight so Knight G5 and now ding plays the move C4 all right he spends uh 12 minutes on this move and this is a very very flimsy move by flimsy I mean I mean like the floodgates are a moment away from opening here I mean really this defensive setup from black almost looks like it shouldn't make sense for example B4 on passong and it looks like I mean B4 is just on the way but black is just in time just in time and you cannot take back with the bishop you see if black even waited one move and white got to play like B4 I mean uh this is potentially devastating for black potentially completely devastating C6 not Knight B7 but uh point stands like this is moments away from being potentially extremely unpleasant Jan takes on E6 and comes back to E3 and like I said I mean he is just knocking on the door you cannot capture you cannot capture because I'm not gonna take this I have what we call and I can take on E6 check and then I will take on D3 and I got news for you it's not just the pawn it's not just the pawn it's much more than that it's much more than that and this Knight on D5 is going to dominate so ding has to fight back right now and he does Bishop H6 a very very well timed move this move not only improves the condition of the bishop it also actually kind of neuters a lot of White's plans Knight G4 and Knight C4 all of this is now impossible and maybe black is starting his own attack that might be wishful thinking Rook D1 with the intention of taking on C4 followed by this this Knight and this queen are holding together the entire position here now ding anticipates the opening of the B file and he plays Rook B8 a nice move so that after DC4 there is always pressure on B2 and now folks um we have Knight takes C4 Bishop takes Pawn takes and personally here I would have liked to see the move Queen C3 I would have liked to see this move it unpins and it threatens to essentially win the game on the spot by taking on C4 with the Knight that does win the game on the spot by the way because you also win every other Pawn uh so after Queen C3 we would have gotten Bishop E3 now you cannot take with the queen because of Rook B2 I mean you you might be able to you might be able to and then we'll get a heavy piece endgame that's not me commenting on the weight of the pieces I am above that uh but uh rather the heavy pieces are called the queens and the Rooks or rather the queens and the Rooks are called The Heavy pieces uh so I would have liked to see Queen C3 unfortunately we get Queen to D6 and now we get the Apocalypse now we get the Apocalypse Now we get something that looks straight out of The Last of Us if you close your eyes here for a second Queen takes D6 close your eyes seriously close your eyes just I'll just listen along listen to all the capturing sounds Rook takes D6 Bishop E3 fe3 Rook F1 King F1 Rook B2 rookie six Rook C2 Rook A6 and a couple moves later Rook a three rookie three okay you can open your eyes now this is what happened I woke up this morning I saw this position I was like what it's like 6 a.m they drew in like a 90 minutes I'm sorry if that's a spoiler by the way I mean if you think anybody's gonna win this position obviously it's uh it's not gonna happen rook in three versus rook in three uh in fact rook and two uh and there was just no way that the the pawn can be defended so they repeat moves um yeah I mean just to walk you through all the exchanges there it's essentially like uh it's it's when it's when a uh Unstoppable Force meets an immovable object right like White's position looks great and it looks like he's gonna capture a bunch of stuff but black is just in time and black is capturing just enough stuff that uh he is fighting on equal terms and the entire position just completely disintegrates I mean they just take each other's pieces completely um so yeah like I said in this position I would have liked to see Queen C3 in all likelihood the game still would have ended in a draw so before you click off and you are completely Justified and so am I by the way in ending this recap it's gonna be the fastest recap um the truth is uh I mean games like this really only benefit the person that are you know that's winning the match right so now we have 12 13 14. so ding has two more games with white and the interesting thing is he actually ends the match with white so that could be a very very big game Jan doesn't mind draws he gets more time to rest and he now has you know an extra day um so what happened here well it's not that the Spanish doesn't work right it's important to analyze your games correctly you want to stick around here for like three four minutes this is like Professor office hours I will tell you exactly how to analyze your chess games so it's not like this game is a discarding of the Spanish what this game probably is is a discarding of the move A3 maybe and even then maybe it's just the fact that Ding played this unique move order without castling and therefore Jan was not able to get anything but the truth is I mean Jan had a pleasant position from the opening he could just play things a little bit differently you know somewhere somewhere around here uh like the move C4 when ding thought on his own maybe Jan just didn't play in in in the absolute perfect of fashion like maybe here instead of taking on C4 Jan could have played uh Queen E2 and kept the tension computer was actually quite fond of the move Queenie too so really young just maybe rushed taking on C4 that's maybe what happened I mean maybe just on move 19 he played a little bit too quickly maybe he should have instead of that played the move Queenie too but probably if we get another Spanish we are going to get D3 and maybe like A4 or something but ding is going to be ready ding is going to be ready for any of these moves the truth is folks uh this match must now be decided by dingler and winning a game with white because Jan can draw the rest of the games he's up again and I will see you for game number 12 on April 26th short recap hopefully uh my explanation of the thumbnails was sufficient and we will go back to normal thumbnails soon and for now get out of here
