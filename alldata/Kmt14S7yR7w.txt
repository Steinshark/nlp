as we've done in a couple of other videos sean we're going to talk about those links between physics and computing and again we're back to the ultimate limits of computation and the book i have in front of me is a book that has caused a massive amount of consternation over the last few decades it's by a guy called k eric drexler now the reason it's perhaps of interest to a computer file audience is 1992 most outstanding computer science book well what drexler is talking about in drexel is a very polarizing figure is can we do computing with individual atoms can we think of instead of compiling code could we compile matter or to put it in another way though drexler didn't put it in these terms but could we do 3d printing with individual atoms could we use those as our very you know very smallest building block and if we could that's a remarkable technology that means we you know because as some of the more extreme proponents of drexler's vision had in mind we could for example envision some technology which is effectively looks like a microwave we'd go outside we'd get some grass we'd come we'd put it into our thing that looks like a microwave oven we press a button and the ding 30 seconds later i pops a stick this is like replicators and stuff it's exactly like star trek replicators one pan-fried catfish we talked about this on one of previous videos that you guys have manipulated atoms and made a switch with atoms yes these sorts of basic building blocks are being pushed around at the minute they are and but drexler's vision is much much grander than that drexler claims that we should be able to take any lump of matter and convert it not quite into any other lump of matter but certainly to break those chemical bonds down and form a structure to a predefined blueprint importantly he's not saying that we have to you know that we're going to disobey the laws of physics it's not saying that we're operating in some strains parallel universe where the normal laws of physics don't work but he is for example talking about systems like diamond he spends a lot of time with diamond which is a strongly bonded substance you know diamond is fairly hard tight covalent bonds holding the atoms in place and he makes the argument that we should be able to um under those circumstances if we can control the bonding on a single chemical bond by single chemical bond basis the atoms will stay in place and we should be able to build up different structures so he focused a lot of his time on on diamond um i can show you a short video sean okay so we have this microwave object and on the side here with these canisters what we have a very simple food stock so very simple stock that's that's put in so simple molecules like co2 water co methane perhaps molecules that can be broken down into component atoms and then built up into something bigger and just how much bigger we'll see in a second and cooling etc quite how it all works we don't know this is science fiction but like the best science fiction it makes you think is this possible could we manipulate matter like this out there on computer phylum think about this does this disobey any of the laws of physics and you know drex has been widely castigated perhaps unfairly i think certainly unfairly in some cases because these are these are grand ideas grand visions that are worth worth exploring are we anywhere near this no we're nowhere near this but you can see what's happening as we're zooming in and now we're down to the 10 nanometer level so just to give you an idea an atom's a few there's a fraction of a nanometer across 8.3 of nanometers so once we're 10 nanometers we're talking about say 300 atoms something like that across so here's these molecules streaming in so in this case it's c2h2 and what's happening is they're being fed through moving across it looks very much like the type of machinery work on mills and factories we're used to in the macroscopic world except it's all shrunk down each one of these single spheres is a single atom and what's happening is you're getting atom atom transfer you're breaking these molecules down you can see what's happening now transferring them across to these tips these probes this is where scanning pro microscopes get like myself get very very interested in that we have a sharp probe we bring it in close to a surface move it back and forth this probe is atomically sharp so it allows us to see single atoms and single molecules and manipulate single atoms and single molecules so some scanning probe microscopes at least look at this and think well parts of that we can do the problem is very very small parts of it we can do moving the video on let's scroll through various different elements what happens later on is we have different blocks that are transferred across different elements quite how any of this works we don't know where does it get its energy source we don't know and out at the end pops a laptop the argument being that what's happened is that those very simple molecules at the start by building them up manipulating the very individual atoms we've compiled matter into this final final form so this video that you said this is science fiction this isn't science fiction as far as whoever you've written this is drexler drexler believes this is this is something that that would be possible in the future um many of us have many issues surfaces in particular are a particular issue in terms of it looks very simple like we'll just get some blocks and we'll snap them together in reality surface physics is incredible surface chemistry is incredibly credibly challenging to um surmount but the again the ideas here are fascinating it it really is could we could we do this even at the level of you know how would we get a power source here for that little sorter for the molecules forget about a whole laptop let's let's reduce this all the way down can we do information processing with single atoms of single molecules or groups of atoms or groups of molecules can we translate all that complexity down and think can we on the basis of individual atoms and molecules do information processing and yes we've done that the nano science community has done that i suspect not many computer file land are familiar with this it's a beautiful beautiful piece of work and stunningly elegant piece of work from uh don eigler's group so don's retired now but his group at ibm almaden was was sir slabs was responsible for a lot of the pioneering um work in nanoscience indeed iglor's group is responsible for manipulating atoms for the very first time and what they spelt out was the ibm logo this is beyond elegant they've done computing information processing they've set up logic gates with molecules and they've done it in a really fascinating way because they've effectively used a domino effect in terms of how molecules interact with each other to transfer information from inputs to output and they've done on the basis of co carbon monoxide very very small quantities you don't have to worry about any poisoning or anything like that also in an ultra high vacuum also at very very low temperatures four degrees above absolute zero so it's not toxic at all but they put them down on a copper surface and when the seal molecules go down on the copper surface they absorb in a number of different states they absorb like this where it forms this little dark patch the red dot represents a co molecule or it forms this type of structure where the two molecules are beside each other which is a dimer two co molecules together or it forms this structure which is a trimer three molecules together how do they image this how do they see the individual molecules well it comes back to that scanning probe technology sharp probe closer surface move back and forth and if the probe is atomically sharp you can see individual atoms and molecules so what they do is they manipulate the co molecules here's a co molecule so you can operate in a mode where you scan or you operate something very straightforward you push the probe towards the surface and you do that and you move it across the surface so you can manipulate an image just by moving the height of the the probe above the surface so what they do is they set up these arrangements they set up dimers dimer dimer dimer diver dimer then what they do is they bring in another molecule this one with the green arrow bring it close and what that does is it triggers see the red dots or the positions in co it triggers this cascade process whereby they all rearrange just like a set of dominoes they're not falling the molecules are rearranging themselves it's not like they're falling over but they're rearranging themselves now that's clever enough that's really clever and although this is uh 2002 although it's 16 years ago it's still like an incredible phenomenal paper is that a reversible process that no because dominoes aren't easy reversible no so what what we're not talking about is so this is this is the difference between fundamental science and technological application first of all you know if we were to take this type of approach i think we're gonna be hard-pressed to sell it to anyone because most people are not gonna want to top the computer up with liquid helium that's the first thing pretty pretty complicated and irritating to keep an ultra high vacuum going moreover the bandwidth is about 0.1 or maybe 0.01 of a hertz because you have to set this entire system up and then set it off it's not reversible there are other systems for which it is reversible but not this but this is this is exploring the limits what they do here is they develop different gates by setting up different arrangements of molecules so here's one example of an and gate whereby you've got input x and input y here and so by by bringing in molecules either by causing a cascade here or causing a cascade here or causing a cascade at both points then the output here will change so basically here if we bring a molecule in here to set a one here but there's a zero here there's no molecule here then what happens is there's no change the output remains however and similarly the opposite way however in this case if you bring in a tripping molecule here and a tripping molecule here or control molecule here then what happens is there is a big change and you can read that as a change in the output so what we have is a logic gate made out of molecules which is is and made out of this molecular cascade okay it operates incredibly slowly okay it's under extreme conditions but as a piece of elegant science it's phenomenal why do they need these incredibly low temperatures why do they need to be at four degrees above absolute zero the problem is with this system with molecules on metal surfaces what happens is if you warm the temperature up even slightly by 10 20 30 degrees something like that then thermal motion kicks in and the molecule starts to wander across the surface so these beautifully engineered structures you've made will fall apart just due to diffusion effectively brownian motion it's not quite pretty in motion but the same type of thing so what you need to do is find systems whereby this type of diffusion doesn't kick in and actually drexler had it right so what you need to think about is covalently bonded systems where the bonds are stronger instead of weak bonds between the molecules and the surface which is actually quite good because it allows you to do this with ease to slide things around with these but the problem is then in terms of trying to exploit that in any type of realizable technology it's really difficult so you need something where the bonds are quite strong and where you can raise the temperature without things hopping around and there's been major efforts over the last few years to do this with um silicon and in fact we're now at the point where this is michelle simmons group in university of new south wales there are a number of groups working on this michelle's group in university new south wales bob walker's group in um university of alberta there's christians you actually sorry christian you know i always get the pronunciation wrong um uh cnrs who's later toulouse who's led a big effort in this there's steven schofield's group in university college london we've dabbled a bit as well not quite at the level of those other groups where we've dabbled a little bit in this in terms of really manipulating at the single bond level michelle's group however has made that important leap whereby they've taken this type of atomic scale engineering and they made a transistor out of it this this paper really nails its colors to the mast a single atom transistor and what they do is they pattern a silicon surface so we did a video for 60 symbols a number of years ago which describes just how this works but basically you take a silicon surface you crack it open and you form two surfaces the atoms here and the atoms here are really uncomfortable they're no longer in the nice environment where they were bonded to the neighbors atoms are very gregarious they like to bond so when you split them open when you split that crystal open expose the surfaces it's a very high energy state the atoms don't like to be in that state so what you can do is you can passivate that surface so you can make it less reactive by adding other atoms to it so the bonds are tied up and a really good one is hydrogen so you for silicon so you take the silicon crystal in vacuum the surface and you bombard it with hydrogen and what you can do is you can sit above an individual hydrogen atom bombard it with electrons and remove one single hydrogen atom so you've got one chemical bond and again to be fair to draxler this is the type of thing he was talking about quite some time ago then what you can do and this is what michelle's group has done is that that one dangling bond now you've got that one bond and it's literally called dangling bond that's what we we call it so you've got this inert surface with this one dangling bond then what happens if you put all the molecules down in this case they've put a phosphorous containing compound down is that it would bond just at that point and that means you can put down a single phosphorus atom at that point and that's what they've done and phosphorus is what's called a dopant in silicon but basically you add impurities to control the electronic properties of silicon and that's how pricked every single electronic device and every single semiconductor device relies on the properties of doping in this case we're down to the limit of doping with a single atom and that's what they've based this this single atom transistor on is they've managed to access and address that single atom to form a single atom transistor so that that's really quite phenomenal interesting the one thing we were missing okay you could create this this dangling bond but really you need to be able to correct it and to reverse it and to be able to error correct for one thing it's taken a long time to go it was like 90s when it was shown that you could do you remove the hydrogen it's taken a long time to get enough control over the probe to be able to just connect the probe or push the probe into the surface and transfer that single hydrogen atom to heal out that defect so here's the defect that one single bond and as you can see hits functionalized tip then they bring it in and they connect with directly that that dangling bond so tip comes in dangling bone tip and at the end of the tip there's a single hydrogen atom and it transfers and you heal it up so we're now at the point where we can make these structures make these dangling bond features but also repair them which means that when it comes to generating logic gates in terms of making structures whereby we can have a rays of these dangling bond features that communicate with each other not in the same not quite the same as the molecular cascades but the same idea where perhaps we transfer instead of a physical transfer of molecules we have a transfer of electrons then we really are processing at the atomic limit we've got a long way to go before we get back to draxler's nano systems a long long way to go but then the next idea is well can we actually we've got information processing at the single atom limit we're processing matter at the single atom limit how far can we push this one three two one three there we are back up nice five one three time because by narrowing down that time we broaden out the energy associated with the with the operation which sets a fundamental limit because the narrower and narrower narrower we get that the broader
