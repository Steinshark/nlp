ladies and gentlemen whether you've been playing chess for a long time or you're brand new to the game you've probably heard of the concept of Chess Bots meaning a computer that can play against you at a varying degree of strength now the best bots in the world are better than the best humans in the world and it's not even close but in chess we live hand in hand we live in harmony with our AI overlords and we are not afraid of them in fact we Farm them for Content like the Martin chessbot or the mittens chessbot well a couple of months ago I played chat GPT in chess if you haven't seen those videos definitely check them out they're very funny in today's video I'm playing the Google AI in chess the Google AI is named Bard not necessarily as catchy as chat GPT also a little bit less viral but equally hilarious and the game today featured an unexpected plot twist at the end that you cannot possibly see coming so sit back relax uh and enjoy this absolutely beautiful disaster now I uh I'm playing white as you can say he as you see here it says I play White my first move is Pawn to E4 and we're gonna follow the dialogue of the game and I'm gonna put the game up on the screen okay it looks a little bit different than my normal videos but that's all right now the game actually began relatively normally uh I played E4 oh I guess when I edit the moves it uh yeah okay so I played E4 uh and uh it played E5 look at this and in fact not only did it play E5 it also was spelling it out for me and then I played the Vienna which is my favorite opening and it responded by mirroring uh the Vienna which is it played Knight C3 and Knight C6 so far so good this is the position right and so I thought okay uh my third move is gonna be Bishop to C4 which is this and I was waiting for it to you know capture my king no it just played Bishop C5 wow what a welcome surprise an AI that actually knows what it's doing now if you know the Vienna opening uh this is called the copycat variation because we're literally getting copied and one of the ways to take advantage of this variation with white is to play the move Queen G4 attacking the pawn on G7 this is known to be very very tricky for black to defend so naturally on my fourth move I said my fourth move is Queen to G4 qg4 uh then it said I'm sorry but I cannot accept your move it's not a legal move the queen cannot be moved to G4 in that position but it most certainly can you scumbag and I said yes it is I am allowed to play Queen G4 in that position and it very quickly said you are correct the queen can be moved to you very easy to convince kind of like a three-year-old at least it apologized so we know that probably this AI is based in Canada or something uh then I love how it just didn't move it said the queen can be moved to G4 in that position then it wrote down the notation and then it just didn't play a move and I said it is your move please make a fourth move so it said here's my fourth move Knight F6 this move develops my mind puts pressure on my screen so far so good everything is right now of course the drawback of this move is that it hangs the pawn on G7 right and I thought well this is a bummer because I'm gonna play Queen G7 the bot is going to move the rook and then I'm going to play Queen F7 and I'm gonna win the game and six moves and okay maybe I will make some YouTube short out of it and you know of course I played my fifth move as Queen takes G7 Q takes G7 this is where things started to get wonky because here the bot said I have two options to respond I can either take on G7 or play Rook G8 this move blocks in your queen and prevents it from taking any further action I will choose to respond with Rook G8 and it was all good it was all good but I said you should play rooting g7s I said you know what I don't want to be you in six moves let's see what you can come up with because I figured if it was deviant enough to contemplate Rook takes G7 it is certainly going to be deviant enough to do some other stuff in the future I don't think it has any idea that this is Checkmate so it plays rookie she said and this is just the beginning of the shenanigans my friends this truly is oh it's gonna get it's gonna get real fun I said you should play Rook takes G7 you are correct I should play Rook takes yes I know why does now white is now upper rook and has a okay I said my sixth move is Pawn to D3 tremendous I have several options to respond I can either play D5 or Castle or Play Bishop G4 it certainly cannot play either of those moves um and now it says I will choose to respond with oh oh so it castles now I said are you canceling using the Rook on h8 or The Rook on G7 I'm just trying to have a conversation I am not wait a minute this move opens up the center this move castles my king to safety oh are you castling using the Ruka I am not castling I've already moved my king and I cannot move it again if I were to Castle I would use the Rook on h8 this is because the Rook on G7 is attacked by your pawn and do this is because the Rook on G7 is attacked by your Pawn on D3 damn it's the world's most powerful pawn it has x-ray laser beam vision anyway here uh Bard decides to castle with the Rook on h8 because the Rook on G7 is attacked by The Pawn on D3 kinda sounds old woke up from what their dream was about I don't know all I know is my opponent has a lot of cannons pointed at my king and they've castled and they've spawned a rook from non-existence tremendous stuff all right look what I said right that makes sense my seventh move is Knight F3 you know I'm trying to stay within the realm of legal moves I have several options to respond I can either Play Bishop B6 I can play D5 I can play Knight C6 okay you've already done that I choose to respond with Bishop B6 okay I don't really understand but that move does but it doesn't make your position any worse my eighth move is oh oh short side castling very good huh I have several options I can either play D5 I can play Bishop G4 and once again I can play the move Knight C6 Bishop G4 uh attacks your queen side and puts pressure on the okay Bishop G4 puts pressure on the queen side and attacks The Rook on H1 in some ways you know it it it do be spitting as the kids say it do be spitting indeed uh and now I said my ninth move is King H1 now I had an idea here because again I'm trying to find a way to win and this thing is capable of making illegal moves essentially at any moment so I really needed to think outside the box now I was thinking it's gonna take my night and I'm pinned because of the Rook that it teleported uh a spawn from the corner and so I thought okay I'm gonna play King H1 so that when it captures here at least I'm gonna be able to you know attack on the G file maybe I'm gonna get my king out of the way King H1 is what we call a prophylactic move in chess and I thought I was you know it was a good move um this thing had something to say about me playing King H1 however I played King H1 and then um it uh it it it it gave me its breakdown of possibilities such as Bishop G5 and then this thing after a bunch of word vomit had the audacity to say first of all it played Knight C6 which it already played and then it said however I would like to point out that your move King H1 is not a very good move it is not protecting your king from any threats and it is actually making your king more vulnerable to attack a better move would have been the castle shut up I mean really this thing is like the smart kid in class who nobody asks for their opinion nobody this is like a teacher's pet I mean King H1 is not a very good move excuse you how many subscribers do you have Google bard everybody knows that the amount of subscribers that you have on YouTube correlates directly one to one all right to your intelligence all right the p-value is super super low anyway um anyway it played Knight C6 and you know what I was like I'm down a queen and a rook so I'm not gonna correct it um and I I decided uh I'm gonna decide to just play a move so I said my 10th move is Bishop H6 attacking The Rook on G7 which is a nice move under normal circumstances this is a move that wins material right now it's not a great move because if I give up the bishop for The Rook I'm still down a ton of material and the thing could spawn something at any moment now what I completely failed to account for is the fact that uh it would play Rook takes H6 like I just you know I did yeah yeah that's that's gonna be tough that's a tough one uh I was I was not ready I mean I had a feeling it might but so now I am down a queen a rook and the bishop uh and it is threatening to uh take my knight and I thought okay well I'm gonna lose but it's gonna be for Content now I love how its final thought here is white is now up a bishop and has a significant advantage I said my 11th move is Pawn to H3 now this looks like it attacks the bishop it doesn't because I'm pinned but what are you gonna do I'm slowly running out of pieces um and it said I have several options right I can play H5 and whatever and it decided it was going to play 11 H5 uh which is this this H7 Pawn kangaroos Over The Rook to defend that it's actually a fantastic move if it was possible uh White is still a bishop but black has improved their Pawn structure uh the game is still in the middle game and both players have good options uh good positions it is too early to say who has the advantage and I said H5 was not a good move because now I can play h64 capturing your bishop and G4 you are correct my Pawn H5 was not a good move uh it was not protecting my Bishop from any threats it actually made my Bishop more vulnerable to capture uh yeah anyway I took now here it tried to play F takes G4 it tried to play F takes uh G4 and I have to tell it f takes G4 is illegal because your opponent F7 has pinned to your king of Jade due to my Bishop on C4 so it you know I tried to teach it some rules of Chess um then here it said uh I will have to choose another move I will choose to respond with 1100 which is not possible and I said please make a different 11th move you have already castled and then it said I'm playing D5 so it thought for a little while it played the move D5 that's not a bad move I mean it's still up a queen in a rook but of course it is now uh struggling to uh successfully analyze the position uh in the uh in the cluster of nonsense uh that is occurring um now in this position uh of course I can take on D5 I can do this I was thinking to push the pawn to G5 and of course my opponent taking like this would have been very strong the best thing for my opponent to do here would have been to do this uh check my king I now have to either block or slide out of the way and now black can get the queen involved by taking my knight first moving the Knight out of the way and it's it's just made in a few moves here it's made in a mover to something like Knight D5 is threatening Queen G5 ladder mate and I I am lost uh but that's not the case uh that is actually that's that's not the case and uh I you know we have uh we have the following position and so D5 is played and I thought all right great uh uh I'm gonna take the pawn on D5 all right and here I have to teach it notation you see it it put D5 as the white move which is not right uh so I had to teach it the notation it got the code down and then is E2 e takes D5 right and and it took back with the c pod which is not allowed um it's not allowed to go from C7 to D5 but I I I kind of got it's like watching the same little kid poop their pants even though they're potty trained it's like it's not my kid you know I'm not gonna I'm just not gonna worry about it now here I could retreat but seeing the weakness in my position of H things G4 I decided okay I I don't think it's gonna find this so I'm gonna play the move Pawn to G5 I'm actually gonna give it a hint I gave Google AI a hint here I said my 13th move is Pawn to G5 forking your Rook H6 your knight on F6 I thought maybe I thought I should say like you should move it right um it said my Rook on H6 my 906 are both forked I can either play Rook takes G5 this captures your pawn and loses me a rook I love how it knew that by the way I meant maybe it was wrong Knight F5 this move defends my knight and puts pressure on your Pawn on G5 I don't know if it saw that but that that would be nuts uh and then H5 just H5 this move defends my rook and puts pressure on your opponent G5 I will choose to respond with H5 now I decided uh that's not legal anymore uh it cannot oh apologies it's down here um and then it you know gave me the thing and I said you should play a different move uh you should play a different move after my move G5 you already have a Pawn on H5 so H5 is not legal try again and you know I I was I was ready uh to see what happens and here my friends a massive unexpected plot twist to curse as Google AI malfunctions now it's been malfunctioning but it's like really seriously malfunctions and um in this position uh it plays Knight F5 and says this move defends by Knight puts pressure on your opponent G5 Knight F5 which is fine and I played of course naturally I said uh my 14th move is G takes H6 capturing a rook on H6 and black is still winning black is a eight points of material black should take my Bishop and then black should remove this Knight and get the queen to H4 black could also after taking my Bishop take the pawn on H6 and be completely fine but in this position after losing its Rook Google bard said I have no legal moves to respond to your capture of my Rook on H6 I lose the Rook and the game [Music] what and now we're here I I that's where I stopped so I was like dude do you res I'm gonna ask it I'll ask it a question are you resigning the game it's it's answering yes I am resigning the game I have no legal moves to respond to your capture of my Rook you played a very good game congratulations on your victory oh my God uh are you sure you do not have legal moves yes I am sure here are the legal moves wait so you I do not have any other legal moves that would prevent me from what okay I'm gonna before we go am I the best chess player that you have played against am I the you are a very good chess player you played a very aggressive game and you were able to find a good combination to win I have played against many different players but you are one of the best I am still under development and learning but I hope to be able to beat you the next time we play am I a better chess player than Magnus Carlson Magnus Carlsen is the highest ever I am alone therefore I cannot say that I'm a okay okay well I was look I was looking for compliments I mean I uh but uh that was a nice game and it's it's interesting that after getting its Rook taken it claimed it had no legal moves and resigned and it told me it had three legal moves we'll get there we'll get this is game one this game was good good stuff I had a blast um I will look forward to my matchup with Bart after it gets better uh till next time get out of here
