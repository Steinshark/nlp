so i got into a netflix donkey series and this is the story of how it all happened how after years of work i thought i was finally gonna get my 15 minutes in the limelight bask in the warm glow of true internet fame netflix fan instead i got one second one second that is unwatchable and i don't mean like unwatchable in the metaphorical sense like an amy schumer special is unwatchable no i mean literally unwatchable if you go to the docu-series on netflix called money explained the first episode is about gibberish quick schemes you could watch all of it you will not find me anywhere that's because you know that little auto play bar where it like automatically plays the next one so you don't have to you like watch the credits and all that like the last five seconds 10 seconds i'm after that you literally have to do what no human on earth has ever done and choose to watch the credits and you will see less than a second of coffeezilla uh featured there and this is the story of how that happened because let me tell you i thought i was heading up in the world guys and by the way i'm i'm not trying to be ungrateful like i think i just think it's funny i'm gonna put as seen on netflix in my bio i'm gonna wear it loud and proud baby but i wanted to tell you guys about it because otherwise you're going to be confused you will never see me on netflix unless you deliberately go search this out so really this is my only proof of this happening so i kind of have to put this out there before i put as seen on netflix otherwise people are going to think i'm making it up and lying right so several months ago like eight months ago at this point i get hit up by the people at vox the people who make money explaining they say hey look we love your channel we're doing a thing on get rich quick schemes and we think you've got the goods we'd love to talk to you i say great yes let's set up a little meeting we're chatting it up i i'm giving them the goods i say this is who you need to talk about you got to talk about christani you got to talk about tai lopez you got to talk about all these guys and they say awesome we want to interview you for our show and i say hmm let me think about yes actually yes i i could fit that into my very busy schedule so i'm excited and you know they're sending me releases and look it's not going to be like life-changing or anything i didn't even know how big this show was at the time i thought it was smaller turns out it's huge which that's cool um so missed opportunities okay it happens to the best of us but anyways they start sending me releases you know i send them my home address we're gonna film everything we've got all these like questions specked out and we are uh two days away i think from the actual interview t-minus two days and all of a sudden i get uh email in my inbox and they say yeah um we ran this up to flagpole to legal and they said like you are what we call fancy language a liability and i was like right i kind of knew that i mean i i sort of told them that up front they said no no we could include you for sure and then they ran it up legal and they were like yeah actually we can't have you on this show but then i discovered the powerful force of pity and i said well am i not going to be part of any of the show like we've done all this stuff all this prep work and i think they um i think they felt very bad for me and i said good you should and so they gave me a like a credit in the show even though i appear nowhere so that's my appearance is at 2214 you will see my name coffeezilla in the credits that is all that is left of me after legal took a look at it they said no we can't talk about anything because and let me explain that by the way we talk about a lot of ongoing gurus things that are happening now scams that are happening now legal people don't like that if you're gonna say something's a scam they want it to already be prosecuted done dusted charged you have to be very careful when you're talking about somebody who has not been charged who's running a scam in places like netflix it turns out don't love calling people out like that and this is not a failure on their part it's just what it is it's just the game that they play and so i think they just realized like this guy's gonna be a massive liability he's talking a lot of trash about people like grant cardone tai lopez all these guys that have not been officially prosecuted by the united states government yet to which i would say what's the point after they have been right like if you're talking about bernie madoff after bernie madoff has done what bernie madoff has done you're kind of late who are you gonna help by saying oh yeah we should have known all along right but look the point is i get it that's why they couldn't include me and from that point on they basically did their own thing they made uh their program on garage quiz schemes which by the way i do think got a lot of things right i think it's worth watching i really enjoy the production value that they go through they do a lot in 22 minutes they cover like every possible get rich quick scheme i definitely think it's worth a watch if for nothing else to watch the credits and see you boy okay but when i started getting messages from my audience being like hey have you seen the show have you seen this money explained i wanted to be like yeah i'm in it or kind of in the smallest possible way and even one of my twitter followers said it looks like you consulted on this show like like he suspected that he had no idea and so yeah i just thought it was a kind of cool story i i want to be super clear if i wasn't already this is not sour grapes i'm not upset with netflix or vox like they couldn't be nicer and that's the funny thing everyone i i interacted with was so nice i almost hesitated putting this out because i was like i don't want to bring them any bad attention i do think it's worth watching but i just thought it was such a great hollywood moment uh for how all that happened i think it's funny that i thought i was gonna get this and instead i got one second of uh fame so don't go tweeting netflix or vox saying stolen valor coffee's no it's fine they did a great job anyways they didn't need me and if anything i'm just grateful they put me in for that one second so i could tell you this silly little story about how all this happened and it's a fun little easter egg you know so yeah that's basically it hope you enjoyed this little story i'll see you guys in the next smell the one [Music]
