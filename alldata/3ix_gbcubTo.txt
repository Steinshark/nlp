- This is a pit of slime. You guys will get in it. I don't care which one of you it is. Last one of you guys to leave
this slime gets 20 grand. Chris, start us off. Hop in. - Whoa, this feels weird. - Contestant number two is Chandler. Please hop in the slime. Chandler you lost the circle
video and the Lambo video. This is redemption time. The viewers want you to win. Are you gonna let them down? - Oh dude, it's crushing my legs. - All right, Garrett your turn. Ooh, flexibility. - Oh yeah, this is weird. - Garrett, are you gonna win? - Yeah, I think so. - Hey, you haven't
gotten a dub yet either. Contestant number four is Ethan. - Who's that? - He edits videos. It's time to give our
editor a chance to win. Ethan, also known as the
guy that we destroyed his car and bought him a new one. And our final contestant. Can you guys guess who it is? Chandler, who's the final... - I have no idea. - Is it Santa? - It's Chandler's dad! - The opposite of Santa. He wants to take all the money. - That's exactly right. I've come to get the victory. - Since Chandler lost the last two, his dad came to show
Chandler how it's done. Is there gonna be a Hallow alliance going on here with you and your dad? - Heck no. This is weird. - Chandler, how long are you
willing to stay in this slime? Are you gonna impress your dad? - I'm gonna beat my dad. - You can't call your dad
for support this time. Garrett, how long are you gonna stay in? - Until everybody else is gone. - What would you buy with the 20 grand? - I think I'd upgrade the Beamer. Or just get another one. Be a double Beamer boy. I don't know. - So a new car. Chris, what about you? You won 20 grand, what you buying? - I'm going to buy McDonald's. - A McDonald's. - A McDonald's franchise. - Well to buy McDonald's you're gonna have to last a long time. How long you willing to go? - About three. - Okay, good. Ethan, you willing to
last longer than three? - Forever. - But more importantly than all of you guys, Chandler's dad. What are you gonna do if you win 20 grand? - I'm gonna get me
something to ride around in. - Okay. - I bought six cars, all for my kids, and I'm the only one without a car now. - Wow. - My oldest son blew mine up. - This has the check for 20 grand. I'm gonna put it in a safe spot. Whoever gets out last, come
grab the check from over here. Chandler and his dad are going
up against the other three. It looks like there's... - Oh, we gonna start that? - That's between you guys. - Get him, get him! - My vehicles, which is
what I call my testicles, are being squeezed right now by the water. So yeah, that's going on right now. - Hey, me and this boy right here? We're definitely getting a victory. - Oh I thought y'all were
not sharing anything. - We're definitely winning. Oh yeah, we're not sharing,
but I'm just saying. - They ain't gonna win.
- One of us is gonna win. - They're not winning. - They're not winning. - 'Cause they cheated and
they plotted against us. - I'm winning. I'm gonna be here for the next 82 hours. - Yeah, until you shift at Domino's calls and tells you to come in. - All right, Chris is getting naked. - What are you doing? I'm drowning! I'm drowning! Help me Jesus, help me Tom Cruise! Ahh! Get my other foot, get my foot! Oh wow, it gets really cold really quick. - Hey, keep your body inside. That is a warning. You can throw a thing of slime
at Chris because of that. - Kame-hame-ha! - Chandler's dad's the only one left. - I legitimately just peed. - Oh my gosh. - Okay. - Get in your corner. - Why in the middle? - Yeah. - It's warm now. - Get in the corner! - My wiener was sideways when I peed. And when I peed it readjusted it to where it is not sideways now. - Chris, can you talk about anything besides your freakin' dick? ♪ Dah, dah, dah, dah, da
da da da da da da da da ♪ ♪ YMCA ♪ - Get it, Jimmy! There it is! - Hey, dance moves! - All right guys, I'm
gonna go get your food. - I'm waiting in the
drive-thru for their pizza. I wonder what they're doing. They've gotta be running
out of energy, right? ♪ It's gonna take a lot
to get me away from you ♪ ♪ There's nothing a hundred
men or more could ever do ♪ - No joke, when I spent 24 hours in slime it was the hardest
challenge I've ever done. To be Frank, you have
to pee in your wetsuit. When I spent 24 hours in
it obviously I had to pee. So I was sitting in my pee, I was freezing in the parts that didn't have my pee. I got a rash, I was miserable. It was terrible. I highly doubt any of them
are gonna last 24 hours, but 20 grand's a lot
of money, so we'll see. - So- - Half an hour-ish. - I have peed twice now. It's a little cold. Come here. Come to the pee! Come to the pee! Okay, well he left my pee. Have you peed any? - Who me? - Yeah. - Heck no, man. - You haven't peed any? - I'm saving mine. - How you feeling? - Help me, Jesus. - Help you, Jesus. How you doing? - I'm doing great. - Chandler's doing great. - You look great, Chandler. Thank you. - How you doing? - Better than ever. - I'm gonna have to call Brother Bob. I need some encouragement. - All this smack you talked. - I'll take his place and I'll stay there for
a month for 10 grand. I know you ain't quit already. Chandler you can do this, man. - We've been here for 10 hours though. - We've been here for an hour. - Oh my God. - Here you go. Wait, you managed to make Crispy quiet? - You did when you brought food. - Dude, I know. He doesn't stop talking. How are you guys doing? - I'm freezing. - He's cold. - He was trying to get me out. He's like I'll give you two grand. Two grand. - Dude, that's pretty good. I'd get out if I were you. - I'm getting 20 grand. Why would I want two grand? - Oh, true. What would you give
Chandler if he got out now? - Five grand. - Whoa. - Really? - That's only if he won though. - Yeah, I don't know if I trust you. You're already complaining
about being cold. - You've already said
twice you want to get out. - Yeah, he said he wants
to get out like twice. - That'd be setting a
bad example for your son. - Where do you think he got it from? - Ooh! - I'm not getting out. - It's your other son! - What's up, bro? - Hey, your dad's in slime. There he is. - Dad! What's up, bud? - I love you, father. - Love you too, man. - Do you have any words of encouragement for your dad? He gets 20 grand if he wins. - Just start praying. - Who do you think has a
better chance of winning? Your dad or Chandler? Chandler doesn't have a good history. Who you voting for? Chandler or your dad? - My dad. - All right, well I'm gonna let them go. Tell them that they need to win 20 grand. - Y'all need to win 20 grand. So I can get a haircut. - Chandler, your brother needs a haircut. You better not get out. - Chandler you better start
learning how to cut hair 'cause you ain't gonna win nothing. - Ooh! Chandler's dad asked if he
could smoke a cigarette. No. We're gonna break your nicotine addiction with this challenge. - Oh my God. - Do you want 20 grand or
do you want a cigarette? - Marlboro! 20 grand! - Ethan you're two hours in. How you feeling? Chandler get away, this is his interview. - Cold, but I'm not leaving. - You're not leaving? - No. - 20 grand's a lot. - 72 hours I'll be in here. - Chandler, two hours. How you feeling? - Ethan's cold. - You're not? - Nope. - Good. Chris, I mean I don't
wanna hear about you. - Fantastic! - Garrett what about you? Cool. Chandler's dad? - I'm still here. - One of these days will
learn your real name. - That's right, Chandler's dad's good. - Okay. That's your two hour update. You all seem fine. - I'm trying to pee, but everyone's talking and I can't focus. I'm a shy pee-er. I gotta pee, don't look! - All right, pee. Pee. Pee. Pee. - Get off of me! - Pee, Chandler! Can you not pee when people look at you? - No I can't! - Marlboro! Marlboro boy! - You looking like a cigarette, boy! - Has to be a Marlboro man. Guys and girls, do not smoke. - Do not smoke. - It will stunt your
growth, you'll be that tall. - Like Garrett. - Mmmhm. - Right. - Chandler how you doing, bud? Are you still trying to pee? - Yes. Leave me alone. - Get away from you, boy. - He's concentrating. - Chandler's one of those people who can't pee when
people are watching him. So Chandler, you have
over 10 million people watching you right now. - I bet Ethan 100 bucks that I can stay quiet longer than he can. - Sounds good. - All right, starting now. Shake hands. We're having a dance off. Come on. - Ethan go. - Hit him with it, Ethan. Ooh! - Oh my gosh, Ethan calm down. The boy got a massage chair
in this corner or something. - I'm freakin' cold. - Yo he's shaking, man. Look at him. - Being right honest
with everybody, I'm cold. - What words of encouragement
do you have for him? 20 grand is on the line. - You can do it, dad! Is it cold in there? - It's freezing, Hannah. - Really? - Yeah, it's cold. - All right. - Who do you want to win, him or Chandler? - Probably dad. Sike! - Sike? What you mean sike? - Chandler hasn't won one yet. Chandler's Oh for two. - Yeah, Chandler probably needs to win one because that would be
embarrassing if he keeps losing. - I agree. Chandler. - Yeah? - Promise her you'll win. - I'll win. - Promise?
- You will? - I promise. - How you feeling, Chandler? - I hate this. I can't feel from my thighs down. - You wanna call your
dad for some support? Here. Hey dad. - What's happening? You doing all right? - No. - Hang in there bud, we need the money. - I know we do. - It is cold. - I can't feel my legs. - I'm slowing down. - Whoa, you said something! - I didn't say nothing! Hey! - Why would you do that? - Yeah, see, you just did it right there. - Chris lost. - I win 100 bucks. Chris owes me 100 bucks. - Chandler you gotta last. I gotta get out of here, man. - Nah, you're staying in. - Your lips are turning blue, boy. Look at your lips, they're blue. - That's the M&M's. Chandler, what the hell makes you think I can last another minute? - You claimed you would. - I ain't claim nothing, boy. It's cold as hell in here. - That's a weak family right there. Dude your lips, no joke, are really blue. You literally look like
you have hypothermia. - I'm cold! - What time is it? Really, it's only 3? I thought it was 3 an hour ago. - It ain't 3 o'clock. - Yeah, it's only 3 o'clock. - Are you serious right now? Oh my God. - Man, isn't Domino's gonna need you back at some point, bro? - No, I quit. I quit. - Come on boy, we gotta win this, boy. You know we're gonna get the victory. - You get it. I'll watch you. - We're a team now. - It's only 3 o'clock. Imagine how you're gonna
feel at 10 o'clock tonight. - I don't care, man. I don't need no money. I've been broke for 57 years. Don't make any difference. Oh God I'm dying. - All right Domino's man,
give me your pizza power. - Can I go back to work? - We're at six hours
in, Mr. Chandler's Dad. How you doing? - Not too good. - But you should act like
you've got it in the bag 'cause you struggling
gives them confidence. - Oh they're real happy with themselves over there, but I'm not leaving. - Are you gonna leave any time soon? - He's ready to bounce. - You said you were gonna win this one. Think of all the viewers that
will be mad if you get out. The Hallows are falling apart. So if any of you three win you'll give a thousand dollars to Chandler? - We already have our collusion. - Yeah, in total. - You're gonna bail on your father. - You're leaving your
50-freakin'-six year old man out here with arthritis, poor back- - You're the one who
said you could beat me. - All right. Chandler gets $1,000 from
our prize pool if we win. - Get on out, man. I got this. - You're leaving your father. You sure? - I can't feel my legs. - Chandler, think of what you could buy with 20 grand. - He's already out, boy. - All right, he's out. Chandler is officially out. It is now CHandler's dad
having to carry the torch. He could've won 20 grand. - He's walking home. - Why don't you join his team and split the money with him if you win? Instead of having to split it three ways you all have to split it once- - I already gotta split
mine with Chandler. - Split what? - Split what? - A whole bowl of nothing, bro? - So Chandler bailed on you. How does that make you feel? - Lonely. - Yeah? - Yeah. - You versus these three. - It's 'cause his girlfriend
freakin' came up here. - I don't know, I think his girlfriend was giving him strength. - How's it going? - If you'll notice,
there's one Hallow missing. - What? - Yeah, your son already got out. - Are you kidding me right now? - Yeah, he got out
literally five minutes ago. - Who are you talking to? - Cassidy just FaceTimed me. I'm gonna win, girl. They claim I'm gonna lose. - I hope so. - Look around, tell me
who's not here anymore. - Where the heck is Chandler? - Where is Chandler! - Are you kidding me? - Nope. - I could've lasted longer
than Chandler in there. - That's what Garrett said. These three are against
me, they all made a deal. - You gotta pull through. - But I'm gonna get the victory. - Yeah right. - They all got coffee. - Yummy. I'mma stay jacked up so
I never have to sleep. Woo! - How does it feel to know you were abandoned by
your own flesh and blood? - Be honest with you, I knew
he was gonna leave first. - Did you have no faith in him? - Oh no, I had faith he
was gonna leave first. So yes, I had great faith in him. - I am surprised he
lasted as long as he did. - I just peed for the first time. I'll tell you what, I could
last another 10 hours now. - Oh my God. - Seven hours in. How are you doing? - I pooped my pants. - Chandler's Dad, seven
hours in how you doing? - Doing great. We're about to eat a steak if we can get this grill put together. - They're gonna make steaks in the slime. How about you, Chris? Seven hours in. - I'm pretty cold, but I
mean it'll be all right. I'm gonna get this dub. - Ethan, seven hours in how you doing? Chandler, you can throw Garrett's poop. - I'm not throwing his poop. - His poop's nasty, I can smell it. It's coming up his back. - Rub your poop on him. - No! Could you back him off me, boss? - Come here, boy. - Don't give up. - Are they really? - 10 million plus people will see this. Don't let them done. - I will not let y'all down. - Don't. - I won't, I'm gonna beat them. Here comes the food. How much wood can a
woodchuck wood if he could? That's not a good idea. - Dude, yeah, you just
put your hand in fire. - Those are flammable! - These hands right here? - Dude, you're literally
putting your hand in fire. Stop. - I can't feel it. - Sizzle that bacon, boy. - Ethan you gonna eat your steak? I think Ethan died. - Did you steak just fall in the water? - Did you get that on camera? - I just dumped mine in
the water by accident. - Why'd you do that? - I didn't mean to! - Ethan are you still alive? - No. - Your pulse actually is really slow. - Hey Ethan! You're not gonna win so you
might as well get out now. - I'm gonna win! - You can't spend 20 grand if you're dead. Are you still gonna give
him a part of your winnings? - Heck yeah. We're splitting 50/50. - I didn't think you could divide by zero. - That was pretty funny. Took me a second to get it. - I've got a deal in the making, viewers, so I'm gonna go ahead and cut out of here. - Wait, Chris is now out. Chris, you officially survived nine hours. - I have hypothermia and malaria. - Mosquitoes aren't here. - Argh! That really hurt. I can't move. My entire back hurts. - Ethan come on, get
out before you get hurt. - Come on, Ethan! You know you want to! - Y'all help him when he gets out, man. So he don't slide and kill himself. - Not doing a Chris. - Hold him. Do you feel better now that you're out? - No. - Yeah, I know- - It feels warmer in there. - I did not feel any better
when I got out either. All right guys, here are
the only two that remain. Keep that torso down. - Ooh, whoa there, buddy. - Is he ruled out? - You can pelt him with
slime if you wanna. - One slime- - Whoa, I got hit. - Jimmy went to go get us towels 'cause he thinks we're about to quit soon, but I still got some fight in me. So we've been in here for a minute. It's just me and Chandler's
Dad, we've been chilling. We're in for a long night. - Hey guys, Chandler's Dad. My main goal going into
this was to beat Chandler. Where's Chandler? Gone. To beat Chris. Chris! He's nowhere to be found. Ethan, that boy was so cold. We paid Ethan to leave. He was getting really cold. We didn't want the boy's feet to fall off. - Sure did! - And now it's me and this dude. So who do you think's gonna win? The Cat in the Hat, or
Chandler's Dad who is frozen, got frostbite, and really
crying on the inside but I'm not gonna let Garrett know. - Why'd you tell me? - Oh Lord! I do need to ask you a question. - What? - Your little secret weapon, when you said you pooped in your pants, was that just to get us to get out? - Maybe. - It was. Tell the truth now, it's just me and you. - Yeah, yeah it was. I didn't poop my pants. - I know you didn't do that. - Yeah, that's pretty nasty. I wouldn't do that. I would've got out before I did that. - I didn't think you did. I don't think you're that crazy. - Hey guys. It's Garrett here. Conditions are getting pretty bad. We knocked the grill over. So it's just been getting
colder and colder. Right now it's 31 degrees outside. It feels like it's freezing in here. I think I can last this one out. Finally get the W. Bring it home so y'all
can stop making fun of me. But I think I got this one on the bag. As you can tell by the sound of my voice I am freezing and I'm dying. I really don't think Jimmy's coming back. I don't know, man. But yeah. - Well I'm about to freeze to death. And Jimmy was supposed to get us towels about an hour ago. Yeah, my lips have been purple. I'm really cold. We'll see what happens. - I just got back with the towels. What'd you wanna say? - I gotta get out, man. - Yeah? Are you sure? You're gonna let Chandler down. - This boy needs to win. I really need to win, worse
than him, but I'm too old, dude. I can't take much more. - You did what you had to do, man. - Yeah, that's unfair. Garrett you're young and... - "You're old." Say it. You can say it. - Give me this W! - Are you sure you wanna do this? If you step out you don't get $20,000. All right, both feet are out. Garrett. - Oh Lord. - You won. - Let's go! All right man, I appreciate you. - You did good, man. - Good fight. - Well deserved victory. - Oh yeah. - Garrett, you won $20,000. That envelope over there doesn't actually have any money in it. But! - You lied to me? - I will write you a
check, swear on my life. You have 20 G's. You are the only one left. 20 grand I will give
to you, I promise man. What are you gonna buy with 20 grand? - You knew what I was gonna buy. I was gonna buy another Beamer. - Wait, really? You're gonna buy another car? - I mean yeah, why not? - All right. - I'm selfish. - You're gonna buy another
car and I don't have one car? - I mean you can... - Can I use your car, brother? - Yeah man. - You can drive Garrett's car. At least you outlived your son. - It's my first W and
I'm super happy about it. Can't wait to go home,
drive in my new Beamer. Stay tuned for the next one
'cause we gonna get that W. ♪ Mr. Beast, oh ♪ ♪ Mr. Beast, oh ♪ ♪ Mr. Beast, oh ♪ - Argh!
