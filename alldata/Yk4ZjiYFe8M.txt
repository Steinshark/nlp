sponsored Gotham my friends in case you can't tell sponsored Gotham was doing quite all right my throat is still bothering me a little bit here I'm uh a little bit under the weather so if I sound a bit raspy I do apologize uh this was a this was a great game Hans has been on fire here in late 2023 he's back up to 2690 back approaching the 2700 level uh and he's playing this tournament in London which combines many players from all over the world we got young guys we got guys like gesh for example who are in the event trying to make a name for themselves Shas Royal is a 14-year-old International Master 15-year-old International master from England uh Andre vakin however is a is is a is a longtime grandmas I believe he's in his 30s he might even be 40 but I think he's in his 30s from Ukraine he's been 2700 very interesting to see how Hans approaches this Hans won a very nice game couple of rounds ago but against E4 he has stopped playing the Sicilian Defense completely in this tournament Hans is a fighter I mean that is like all the games that Hans wins are not like methodical little positional squeezes where he takes advantage of a bishop for a night like when Hans beats people he like really really beats people but in this tournament H's played E5 every game he's played E5 every game and E5 is not really an invitation to party E5 is very solid and on top of that every one of his opponents thus far the first two and now vakin have played the Spanish so nobody is playing the Italian against Hans maybe Hans has something interesting cooked up there with the black pieces but everybody has played Bishop B5 and Bishop B5 puts black in one of three situations number one you play the UGA stuff you play the stuff that's the sidelines you know you play the coio you play the the Neo steinet with a6d you play a sideline number two is you play the main line you play Knight F6 you you play the morphy's defense Knight F6 then you choose you know do you put the pawn here do you put the bishop there or there like what do you play or you play the Berlin the Berlin defense against the ru Lopez or the Spanish is a weapon that was popularized in the year 2000 when karnick yes that same karnick that recently has gone after Hikaru but claims that he's not going after Hikaru it's very weird and the cheating stuff but karnick played Knight F6 that move immediately attacks the pawn you don't waste any time attacking the bishop and he neutralized Gary Kasparov in the 2000 world CH championship match now the Berlin is a weird opening for a guy like Hans right it it's like it's like if you like colorful clothes and stuff but you but you just buy like you know like a totally white car or like a totally black car like it it just somehow doesn't make sense right you like spicy food but you eating Bland rice it's it's weird the reason it's weird is because it's just very like boring very solid for example Castle's Knight takes and now there's two lines obviously against Knight F6 white can also not allow the pawn to be taken this is called anti- Berlin but inviting the Berlin immediately getting the pawn taken here black basically goes on a little circus like a little rodeo grabs the pawn gets out of there gives the pawn back and is just in an equal position so Knight takes E4 now H's games in the tournament thus far have both gone rookie one this is like a modern m a modern m line white attacks the Knight like this and and the pawn you get Knight D6 and then white often times will capture and then black will play Bishop to E7 and it's very solid just very solid um instead of rookie one which is the modern Main Line uh vakin plays D4 which is the classical Main Line the idea of D4 is to get more pieces in the game as fast as possible black really shouldn't capture because then Rook e one comes with a lot more Venom so against D4 what black does is gets out of out of there targets the bishop on B5 now there is a line here where nowadays people are making draws in 10 moves which is by giving up this bishop trapping the Knight and then there's a line here which ends D5 and then Queen E4 and queen like this is called the Berlin draw nowadays when Grand Masters uh are lazy or they're you know drawing games on purpose to get more prize money or whatever this is what they go for um but instead of that the main line is to take the Knight take the pawn and trade the Queens this is what we call the Berlin end game this is the start of like imagine a a mountain where you go skiing cuz skiing is a real sport and snowboarding is just for douchebags I'm just kidding if you snowboard you're one you're way cool I'm the reason I'm insulting snowboarders is cuz I was never cool like you I tried skateboarding when I was a kid I was terrible I was unathletic but skiing skiing is like you know elegant classy it's like in Utah they ban snowboarders from Park City right or Deer Valley Park City I don't remember point is if you ski you're elegant and cool and if you snowboard you might be a douchebag like I there's a higher probability that's that's all I'm saying you could do whatever you want you take that information anyway skiing snowboarding not the point the point is I don't even know what I was saying the point is the Berlin endgame all right is on the board I really I forgot what my I'm going to remember it halfway through the video but there was a reason why I made fun of you know people who were skiing and snowboarding but I don't remember you will cuz you just watched and you can re I can't rewind so anyway um Berlin endgame on the board and ah I remembered what I was going to say it's a skiing mountain with many Maps like you have many slopes and so this position has been played a 100,000 times at top level online over the board there are so many plans here his historically white has developed the Knight white has given a check the black king chooses whether to hide on E8 behind this Pawn or on C8 so for example Bishop D7 and then maybe King C8 in the future getting off that way now that's one way now white historically has put a rook on D1 either that one or that one also a move that white likes to play is H3 to prepare an advancement of the pawns another move that white likes to play is Bishop to F4 and it's just like choosing at what point you take what plan black has many plans too sometimes black will put Bishops like that Rook D1 the king will go there put the bishop there Knight might come here H5 is a move to prevent white from playing G4 and and advancing on the side of the board so black can commit the king to two squares the bishop sometimes the bishop will come out that way you know there are plans where the bishop goes out this way so the Berlin is ever evolving ideas are sprouting up like fresh vegetables and that's the really fascinating thing about this opening like it it's it's boring on the one hand and it's way too complicated on the one hand but it really is interesting stuff now vakin plays the modern Mainline which is H3 the idea of H3 is it's not committal it's not committal you allow black to choose his path you don't know if you're going to put a rook on D1 yet you don't know if you're playing Bishop F4 you don't know if you're playing Knight C3 some of you watching might be confused why white can't just go do that black will just go here and now now you've wasted time now you try to develop and black can kick you out not to mention black can also like how do you guard you can't there's literally nothing you can't guard the pawn idiot so like it it looks like a totally innocuous position but the Berlin endgame is fascinating fascinating so H3 and now Hans has to choose an approach now what Hans does here is he tries to impose a little bit his playing style which is like forcing trying to be a little Dynamic trying to get to the point play plays Bishop B7 the idea of Bishop B7 is that he doesn't want to shuffle and commit any pieces anywhere he he actually wants to go here that's the point he wants to trade Knights so he wants to get rid of White's Knight and trade off and so white can't really like easily take advantage of anything on this side of the board he'll have to push his pawns now vakin plays another surprising move uh not not yet excuse me not yet I'm I'm fast forwarding instead of giving the check right away or playing G4 valan develops the Knight that move is not surprising right we we've Ted the Knight goes to C3 a lot it could go to C3 now originally I I rushed now Hans plays Knight H4 you can tell from their time usage they're both still in their preparation Knight H4 now white should either take or move because if you ignore you're just going to damage your own pawns and it's even worse than that Black's just a pawn up now not only is black pawn up black has a past H Pawn which is going to be a huge problem cuz he's going to go go here like let's say A3 he's going to go here and then he's going to push the pawn literally the entire length of the board so white takes on H4 black takes black has removed some more pieces from the board and now black would like to play Bishop F5 and commit his King you might wonder King's in the center that looks really dangerous it's not three checks you don't win by checking your opponent right King is actually completely safe and because it's an end game give it a couple of moves black is going to go Rook d8 just start TR pieces Black's going to be completely fine so the Berlin really messes with a lot of our kind of pre-existing knowledge in chess Bishop E3 and now Hans plays H5 seemingly the last move of his preparation that move controls white from playing G4 cuz if you don't white will probably play F4 G4 and you know F5 like this like that this is what white wants white wants all of this all this good stuff Rook D1 King G2 and and this is what white wants that's why white begins with H3 in the first place H5 stops G4 and now now now now vakin plays a move that is very rare and he introduces quite a new idea it's not exactly new from the standpoint like it's never been played but the way he plays it is very interesting in this position again either of White's Rooks can go to D1 but now it would make a lot more sense to bring this one historically like in this position this Rook has gone to D1 but you just traded the queen side so you got to keep this Rook behind the pawn and the a rook oh my goodness my nose is itchy The Rook will go to D1 here but fakin plays Knight H5 is on the board and fakin plays Knight E2 now he thought for 28 minutes so I don't know if it was prep or inspiration but I think I mean if it was prep it was a really good bluff because sometimes you can pretend not to know something in chess but you actually do which is really but he doesn't play Rook D1 plays Knight E2 now the reason he did that is it's a it's a it's a it's a endgame is position that's pretty closed in the sense that there's still a lot of Pawns on the board a lot of maneuvering can still occur it's not a very confrontational position just yet his Knight had no future on C3 now he could have gone to E4 but then it would have walked directly into Bishop F5 so he routes it this way to come forward which is very interesting right the Knight wasn't going to accomplish anything on those two squares this move has been played about five times in human history twice by Maxim VRA mvl Frenchman both those games ended in draws now Hans plays King E8 so Hans doesn't think Hans knows the king belongs on the E8 Square he's probably going to move his bishop and put a rook on d8 instead or he's going to bring his King to G7 he's going to play here and put his King on G7 where it's going to be safe Bakin now again does not put his Rook on he plays f three that's interesting so now Bishop F5 makes no sense because this not only defends the pawn it also attacks the bishop and then white could even crash through or play F4 F5 so King E8 F3 what F3 no Rook to D1 we're not bringing the Rook to the open file why are we not doing that well that's that's chess like we have to sit here and understand vakin wants to play G4 he wants to implement that plan which would counteract the natural progression and development of the black position Hans brings the bishop back to E7 he thinks for 10 minutes he has a lot of options can play Bishop F5 Knight D4 and then drop back because now at least he can put a rook there play C5 but instead of doing that you know I just mentioned putting the bishop there doesn't make look look it makes like like doesn't look like it makes a whole lot of sense maybe G6 but he doesn't want to commit his Pawn just yet I'm not sure but he gets the bishop out of the way and now Vol nope volin still doesn't play Rook D1 and the interesting thing is vakin spent 28 minutes on this move but then he plays every other move oops then he plays every other move instantly he plays every other move instantly he plays F3 fast and he plays G4 fast so was Knight E2 preparation was he just bluffing like he never puts the Rook on D1 every game in the Berlin ever played puts a rook on D1 in this position so Vin basically invents a new way to play against the Berlin which is really interesting he doesn't put the Rook on D1 he's waiting now black has a very difficult decision does he take does he ignore pushing is wrong because it allows white to get this Avalanche this is very bad for black so you don't want to push but do you take or what do you do do let's say you wait well now now I have a Target right you gave me a Target so okay what if I wait with a pawn then White's just going to advance like at some point black is going to run out let's say black also Waits but now I'm bringing my knight to G3 so are you going to take or not if you take what's going to happen it might we're taken like this I'm going to get you in on the H file so white is going to have way more time and way more useful moves Knight G3 Rook D1 all this stuff so Hans true to his play style tries to solve things by force F5 now he has two pawns staring at the G4 Pawn he's looking to apprehend volin right here big moment for volitan take that pawn take that pawn push or ignore four decisions to be made pushing looks very feeble because by taking the pressure off both pawns black can just lock the position Knight F4 King F7 White's not going to make any progress KN di mention can Bishop take G5 maybe so we can't even do that we have to play H4 first but you don't want to push you don't want to p a little bit boring you don't want to push so you don't want to push do you take do you take or do you take on pass not because it's forced well it depending on your ELO it's forced but what do you do here so vakin takes on passan and now Hans can take with the bishop or the pawn very difficult decision because if you take with the bishop we might end up in an end game where I just have open files I have a three on two Pawn majority and I'm just going to expand and advance and that looks a little bit unpleasant because black has four white has three but black C pawns are doubled so it's hardly felt whereas here white has a very clear majority so a very difficult decision and Hans opt ultimately chooses to take with a pawn quickly Hans takes quickly he decides to take with the pawn now Knight F4 and now I have this very powerful wall and I'm attacking your Pawn you have to make a decision if you don't make a decision I'm going to take with the Knight I'm just going to grab the I'm just full Pawn up now I've already said if H4 feeble it's a very feeble move Knight G6 is going to come in that Pawn's weak white can advance so black takes and now another very interesting decision a moment ago if black had taken this Pawn like this white would have had to take with the H Pawn to to get out of the way but I got news for you even if something like G4 G6 King G2 HG white would have taken with the H Pawn because you are building the pawns together versus a cluster that is together these pawns together into those pawns together but the second that Hans Neeman took with the pawn everything changed because Black's pawns are no longer together so white does not have to take to keep his pawns together if black had a Pawn on G6 which was counteracting both pawns you would want your pawns to be together but now because there's nothing covering the H file this Pawn moved to the f file it doesn't cover the H file anymore vakin takes with the F Pawn and the idea is to create a pass Pawn in fact it already exists a pass Pawn a pawn that has no pawns hindering its progress pieces can block it but it's not the same thing this will get taken nothing can take this Pawn if it's protected so alakan creates this imbalance he's down 40 minutes on the clock Hans playing very fast but a very nice positional game and now Hans again a massive commitment a massive commitment because at least this Pawn covered the G Pawn advancing so Hans could have played something like King F7 but then you know valiton would have like Bishop D7 Rook G6 but instead of that instead of waiting instead of sitting there and preparing his position Hans tries to immediately solve his problems which would make sense if it would leave him in a situation where he's just got a pawn Target but vakin is an experienced Grandmaster good positional player very good and now it's time and look now he doesn't bring the Rook here he brings it here The Rook waited it was patient White has four pieces out black has one four out of Black's pieces are on the home squares the Berlin in and of itself is an opening my friends where the black king is on the back rank the pawn structure is damaged pieces are fighting from here but the point is the position's closed three pawns four pawns you build the wall you prevent your king from being in danger but Hans plays the Berlin too aggressive i l in this game and vakin makes him pay for it when the position ends up opening up the way it does it's the black king that is unable to defend himself the black pieces are not able to come to the battle in time because they're all on the back rank so the the plan the style does not fit the opening is why I don't understand why does Hans demon play the Berlin I I'm not playing in the London chess classic so I I can't speak but he's an aggressive player he's a dynamic player it's just so shocking and now plays King F7 but now it's too late the white initiative is now roaring Bishop D4 and The Rook goes to d8 how is white going to capitalize with all of this mounting pressure on his position well my friends no good game is finished without your favorite sacrifice what am I talking about what sacrifice obviously not Rook takes Bishop there's no followup to that move there's no that doesn't work work and your Bishop is hanging you got to go here first right well yes or no in this position andrean sacrificed the that was a blooper there's this new chess.com has this new analysis feature that they built where it allows like you to highlight the move and my mouse was highlighting Bishop C3 still okay we're not going to edit that out that's hilarious that's going to end up in a compilation somewhere in this POS nobody has to know that in this position Andre volan sacrificed The Rook Rook takes E7 but why why would he do that it's the culmination of his entire plan what am I talking about why am I speaking in riddles well to get his Bishop out of danger now he gives a check but it's not about that it's he didn't do this to give a check he did this to remove the Bishop from the defense of the diagonal and now he plays G5 the pawn is blocking Black's own pieces that move F5 by Hans was an overc commitment now the pawn is blocked The Rook was sacrificed to advance the Pawns connected passing pawns opposite color Bishop is scorts the pawns because nobody can fight back against it and this bishop still cannot get out and there was no way to stop this this still would have worked because of here Bishop E7 is a fork a brilliant positional sacrifice of a rook spectacular positional understanding Bishop C5 G5 and I got news for you stockfish does not realize how bad this position is like maybe it can defend this against the human but at a high depth after the move G5 as far as I'm concerned the position is over like I'm going to just double check real quick after G5 low depth stockfish still claims it could probably defend but I'm not so convinced it thinks B6 and then it's thinks like Bishop A6 and then I think it tries to create AC counterplay before white is able to advance but this is a nightmare position to defend this black and I got news for you in this position despite a major time Advantage Hans completely does not defend it the right way he plays Rook G8 trying to stop the pawn vakin obviously just advances now if you play Rook h8 you're wasting time because I'm going to get my pawns there and the closer they get the more time time is running out so now Hans gets the bishop out apparently what he should have done is gone here stockfish really wanted the bishop on this diagonal I don't really understand why but I think it wants to trade and stockfish makes the argument that the pawns will not defeat the lone Rook that's what it's arguing you get all of this you can get the check but at some point black will be able to defend himself against these pawns and maybe even sacrific the bishop for two of them but instead of all of that Hans plays this H4 Bishop B6 and then in this position he plays a fancy move which is Rook G6 but balakan does not have to take the Rook plays Rook G1 trying to advance plays Rook E1 targeting the bishop repeats once and just shuffles his Bishop to cut more diagonal space Bishop E5 the position is mounting and building the pressure Hans plays B5 trying to just seize a little bit of space on the queen side black has no play so vakin sneaks in and grabs a pawn for good measure now he's got another Pawn Hans plays Bishop E4 vakin now Zips in on this diag you just can't break the barrier he loses a pawn but this is not the time to be active now all of White's pieces are swarming the black king Rook d8 check King F7 repeating again kicks the bishop out of the position Hans could have played Bishop E4 but it was just a matter of time Bishop E5 and oh my goodness the bishop is hanging and that is a devastating threat rook f8 and in this position Hans resigned because after King F7 White's going to go here with a fork here and you're going to win this Rook d8 check and the game is over what a game from Andre vakin what a master class in how to dismantle and overly aggressive Berlin defense the Berlin is a solid opening I mean it is designed to neutralize white in a Ru Lopez in a long grinding end game but Hans just was a little too confrontational his game was maybe that's just his whole personality being too confrontational but it's fascinating that playing F5 and like this with best play could hold but a fascinating transformation of the position from volin and F5 is fatal mistake as far as I'm concerned F5 was the move that that sealed the deal because after that white got too much and what what Ace what a sacrifice and the question is should Hans have played Rook E8 because after Rook E7 no probably you can still go G5 but then there might be Rook e four I don't know but this was an incredible idea from volan and uh just shows you Han still has time still got time to work on the game be a little bit you know a little bit more patient a little bit more uh professional I mean I don't know professional is not but you get what I'm saying so we'll see but a great game from vol vakin and an uncharacteristically shaky one from Hans over the last few weeks who has shown really really good form um I'm going to cover the good in the bad like I do with all the best players in the world and uh Hans doesn't yet have the credit of being the best player in the world uh or one of the best he's you know top 40 or something uh but uh definitely one of the most popular so I will be covering his games and that's all I have for you today uh yeah get out of here
