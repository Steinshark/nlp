good good so yeah we just uh we just didn't record some interesting things that's why i always i almost always start recording right away because yeah it's probably better to do it that way i was gonna oh well we're already recording but what i actually the thing that i wanted to talk about off-camera we talked about on camera and then just edited or something uh was mostly uh like i think that we should start to to to be more deliberate about some things like in terms of because i see that there's so much crossover between the bridges of meaning thing and then the symbolic world thing and uh and and i think that because of that it would be a good idea to be a little more deliberate about kind of ways of collaborating and ways of working together and building on what each other and what we're doing so that we're actually building something for that'll last that'll last or that will produce fruit let's say so i think that that's something that i'm looking forward to next year that's when i get settled into my house and hopefully things are going to calm down and i'll have more time and energy to get involved um in that kind of stuff like i've visited your me your bridge as a meaning thing a few times and it kind of dropped in i don't even know how discord worked so i always like i drop in on conversations and people and then i don't even have my mic on or something yeah anyway so we'll figure it out no i think that would be a good idea i don't know exactly how um the bridges of meaning thing so it was members of my local meetup that started that and it has continued to evolve and it continues to evolve it's you know one of the things that i i struggle with is how we can use these platforms for good but not be overly innocent or naive about the distortions that they bring into patterns of relationships yeah and you know we you know before we started recording we were talking about you know i'm glad i'm glad i'm doing this in my 50s because if i had done something like this in my 20s and 30s i'm really concerned about how this would have formed me because the the the relational dynamics that you know it's it's immensely flattering to have the kind of influence that one has where people are listening to me for i mean the people who listen to my youtube channel hear me far more than the people in my local congregation and they lack the they they lack a bunch of the collateral information that is normal in face-to-face relationships and i think what that means is that there's distortion in in sort of the relational i don't even have the words for it yeah no there is because like you we talked about i guess we we're gonna go back up there is an aspect of the screen that creates a celebrity weird celebrity thing and uh and you know i think it has to do with the fact that you're watching someone who doesn't see you and also the fact i've talked about this just the fact that you're looking at a person that's emanating light i think something is as simple as that where you're standing you're you have a frame like it's like a it's like a speaking icon you have this frame and you're looking at it and it's talking to you and it's emanating light and you and it doesn't see you so i think that there's something about that interaction which is obviously dangerous because it it and also because because we're doing this on a screen there's a frame and we can control that frame to a certain extent right because even in reality you can you can control the frame a little bit but on this it's much easier like i can you don't know anything about my private life like it's just not a parent you don't see me fight with my wife you don't see me you know get being patient with my kids which would be something that in a normal relationship in a church or in a community you would be able to see my foibles and all of my you know all my my darker side not all of them but at least enough of them so that that the frame wouldn't have taken over whereas now i have to almost total control over what you can see of me you know and so it's a so it's a dangerous way of interacting with people yeah one of one of the things that we've done on the discord server lately is we started it kind of has morphed into what we're calling open studio and in sense of an an art open studio and that we're we have our cameras on and i in the discord server i've wanted to at least to a degree create a community where there are cameras on because i mean what we're doing that distortion that you just talked about on youtube is all over the internet because you have an avatar you have a false name you there's a context-lessness and that that of course creates the environment of trolling where people drop in you know unleash their payload and evaporate out and one of the things that you see in real life communities before i got to this church this church had a bad history of destructive congregational meetings and part of that was people stand up in a big room unleash their anger frustration and sit down and the community suffers and so one of the things that we did early on was if i knew we were going to have a congregational meeting to talk about hard things i would split them up into groups of eight or ten put chairs in a circle so if you had to say a hard word you had to say it to people's faces and so if you said something painful you would see the pain on the face that you just delivered the thing to and and this i think is a big piece of of overall the the brutality that we see in our culture that there's so much you know if you're if you're going to be a human being and you're going to hurt someone you should have to live with the sight of the pain that you inflicted and so i don't know i i i think about that in terms of okay so what's my goal i i mean i don't know maybe you've done more reflecting on this i mean i i backed into this thing and it's you know don't get me wrong it's been it's been fun it's been some of the most fruitful ministry of my life but it is i i am concerned i am concerned because of the ways that it is it is unreal in these respects and it is it is ephemeral it just it can it can just float away unlike when you invest in a real living community yeah do you are you are you afraid also this is the thing that has bothered me or kind of preoccupied me is the problem of it replacing also yes normal normal community and so people don't end up joining a church or doing them joining a community because it's like they have this thing online that they that they get something from but it's but that it's a kind of a pale version of real community yeah i think so i and so i've you know over the i've watched brett and eric weinstein do their thing and the whole plan b idea i mean and this gets into the covid reset all of these ideas that okay we're going to remake the world now and we're going to use these tools and and and i watch them and i listen to them and i think number one i don't have a lot of stock in in your level of wisdom as to what the world should be that's right but also number two they spend no time that i can see i mean again now both of us are christians here so people might roll their eyes a little bit at this but the the whole point of tom holland's book to me was that jesus reset the world in a in such a deep and profound way that to me even in terms of you know public knowledge it seems really hard to argue against the fact did that fact and and then then i pause and ask okay you know three years of public ministry pouring himself into a dozen official disciples one of whom betrays him you know there's another group of 72 or 120 so there's a small group of people and and what jesus unleashes you know begins to roll out of course to the degree that constantine for example you know adopts under this banner he goes and constantine doesn't quite understand what he's doing and and to me this okay you want to change the world why don't you look at what i think is the man who changed the world more than anyone else and look at how he did it instead of running up youtube metrics um political organizations i mean not to say that those things don't have impact but it seems to me well if you really want to change the world for the better and you've and you actually embrace certain aspects of this man's value unwittingly and unconsciously and continue to want to promote it and maintain it in the world and i don't know i don't know yeah there's that it's interesting to understand that the text from paul i forget in which where it is i'm not good with the with the the chapters and verses but he talks about how it's like at this very moment christ is is dominating like he's ascending the hierarchy and he's he's uh subjugating principalities and it's like it looks like he's talking about a a you know like a weird science fiction thing that's happening in the background like like he's that he's doing these things like almost like in a like in a i don't know like some japanese manga or something but then you realize that it's it was actually happening because 300 years later the entire empire converts to christianity so it's like secretly in the background christ was was was the fruits of what he did were were increasing secretly and then suddenly and all of a sudden it started to show and then finally you can see that the world had been transformed yeah and uh and actually understanding that that's how reality works is is super interesting because you can also see it you can even see how a weird you know the weird flip that happened in uh in culture let's say how like the united states went secular and russia became christian like you can understand that that you can understand that change that way whereas each country was secretly trying to influence the other like you know america was sending bibles to russia and like sending secret missionaries to like go encourage the church and russia was like sending was sending you know distant stuff to like encourage radicalism and incurred revolution and encourage uh racial tension all this stuff was being happening from the other side and then in secret the seed grew and then finally the two fruits appeared and they would look like they had switched places anyways it's just interesting to think that that's how actually reality works is that there the fruits grow in secret first and then finally the it's not about changing this changing systems doesn't you need to change the hearts like changing hearts is what would what actually transforms reality it just takes time it doesn't happen fast well i i don't know you i mean your work has has really impacted me in this way i mean part of what i've been you know i did a video on i don't quite have the i don't quite have the language for talking about what you're doing i don't because what i what i s you know the last couple of days what i've been thinking about is i i see cartesian dualism coming to an end and i see i think back on some of the previous conversations that we've had and and i think that's sort of the way your work has been colonizing me i mean the the second conversation we had was about angels and demons and again i had the experience of i wasn't quite sure what you were talking about but i i knew it was important and and so what i've what i'm what i'm seeing happen is that this cartesian dualism of of sort of a a of of imagining the world as particles and that this is going away and your more pervasive paradigm as sort of the sort of at least in the imaginary the base level of of experienced reality being patterns that's you know that's that's what's been seeping into my head and and so your conversation with um with adam and rationality rules i mean those those to me sort of elicited the most dramatic contrasts because it it made it it made it exposed the fact that they in a sense were building the world from the ground up on matter and you were asserting that matter doesn't determine anything matter is always colonized by something yeah it's always it's it's always formed by by light it's always formed by logos it has to because or else it just it's just uh it's just a sea of potentiality and it's this is it's really like a technical thing it's like because underneath the world even in scientific terms is it whatever they call it quantum field or whatever it's possible possible uh positions of of subatomic particles like that's what's underneath everything and so it's not even determined it's like it's a it's a mush right it's like a mush of indeterminacy and so and then stacked up on that you have these identities but you know these identities are stack up in terms of meaning they don't stack up that's how they stack up they meaning is that which forms the world and i think the the greatest thing that's happening right now and that's really the most exciting thing is i think we're in a place where people can understand that and it's hard and like you said it's hard because you can see in those two conversations i had especially the one with rationality rules i think it's it's like they they don't they don't see it at all it's like it's a blind spot and so you try to point it out and they're like they don't know what you're talking about it almost kind of just floats over and then they want to come back to the things that interest them uh but then when you when you assert cert these this type of reality it just kind of it's weird it kind of just floats by and and you see that and i think this is the thing that i saw even with with someone like brett weinstein or other other other characters in these types of discussions is that they if you try to point out how reality works they it's like i don't know it's hard to understand why people can't i don't understand anywhere why people can't see it because i've been seeing the world this way for 20 years but i i encounter people who tell me like you said like you said before i didn't know what you were talking about and then in one day or slowly it started to click and then it's then i started to see oh this is he he this is what he's talking this is what he's talking about right um so so i think that if there's one thing that i'm that i'm doing i hope that that's it like i hope it's to help people understand the inevitability of meaning and the inevitability of and that this is what scripture is talking about like the description in genesis is a description of a of an ontological hierarchy right it's more that than anything else it's a description of how there are analogies of above of light meaning breath all of these these things that that that are talked about in the first chapter and then there are analogies of below the darkness unformedness chaos emptiness uh water like all these images and and it's it's just like a massive putting all these analogies together to try to help you understand how how the world exists and still exists now it's the world exists the same way that it's described in in in the in the first chapter of genesis it the manifestation happens in the same way as what's described in that in that in that book you know it's still light meaning logos uh that comes from above and that which calls forth uh you know from the earth forms and also there's a there's even in creation so there's a kind of freedom there because god says let the earth produce and so it's like god is giving a main category it's like let god let the earth produce uh uh you know plants that produce seed of their own of their own kind and so god is giving the meaning and using the seed thing it's like let let's produce plants that have the same identity a continuous identity and we'll continue on with that identity and then after that there's all this variety which kind of comes up and that variety it's almost like god didn't have to say all the different names of all the different plants he just like there's the main category which comes down and then there's this filling up i use the example i don't know i forget which part of i think i did use that example in the rationality rules discussion or maybe it's not the one that was recorded where i say you know god says let there be cars and then audi and all the companies start producing all these different varieties of cars you don't need to from above like you can have like larger larger categories right and then they they kind of scale down and start to to disseminate into the world so it's like that's how reality works like even now god is the world's still being created that way well yeah and you can see that in markets that you know once once you know let's say the computer manifest there was compact and ibm and hp and you know hundreds of little places where computers were manifesting all over the place and let there be computers and and suddenly there were there were computers all over the place yeah and there's the and then there's this like uh i forget which term john uses but john has all these great terms to talk about this this system of how the there's a there's like an exchange between the identity and the multiplicity and there's this this kind of breathing in and breathing out you know where where there's a pushing and pulling and then that's how the the so it's not a static reality it's a dynamic relationship between identities and and their potential and so it's like it just moves back and forth you know uh and it and it ends up being like a like the breathing in and breathing out of of of reality so and so i think that that's like if i can get help people understand that and also understand that if someone asked me something like you believe that that the genesis creation account happened it's like not only do i believe it happen i believe it's happening now it's it's always happening it's the most happening it's the most it's the best description of reality that has ever been written down so it's like i not only do i not want to discount it it's like i i base my entire world on it everything that i think is based on that account and and i feel no no qualms or shame about saying that and i don't feel like i like it's a stretch of my imagination i don't have to push my imagination anywhere it's it's uh it's that's how reality really really really works but i i think if you because it's i really liked your conversation with guy and i know i know you know you might have felt oh this is too much talking about me but i i think i think it's really in in a sense people have to sort of walk with you through your story to get to where you are now because if you look in a tribal frame from what you just said of genesis a whole group of people in christianity and certain segments of christianity would say oh i'm so glad to hear jonathan say that but they still have absolutely no idea what you're talking about because they are because they are they are materialists and the entire conversation i mean the western church the western church ripped itself open over this question about how material is genesis 1 and and you know so john walton who taught old testament at wheaton college and has written some books the lost world of genesis one this lost world series he i mean even when he in the evangelical space starts talking about the fact that this really isn't about materiality that you know certain parts of the evangelical world hear that and get nervous and but then the other side of it so you have the fundamentalist modernists the other side of it sort of cheer but for the wrong reasons exactly no you're right i totally agree yeah and and so i think it's i think it's important you know i think what you're doing is vitally important because you can't take this thing on directly because you know it one of the most interesting moments of the gospels that always shocks me is so jesus is heading down to jerusalem with his disciples and he says okay this is what's going to happen we're going to go down to jerusalem first they're they're really nervous about going down to jerusalem for real reasons and we're going to go down to jerusalem i'm going to be turned over into the hands of gentiles i'm going to be crucified and three days later i'll rise again they didn't seem to hear anything about the rising again they did not register and the only thing they heard was the political layer of this that i am going to be i am going to the the gentiles are going to have me in their hands and they're going to have their way with me and of course peter stands up and says i'll never let this happen and get behind me satan and i think that's i think that's an instructive that's an instructive lesson in how people change and even even the entire so when i was in college you know so i grew up i grew up a minister's kid you go to way to college i went to a christian college but calvin college sort of had the theme of we're not going to be your parent if you want to drink and if you want to if you want to rebel you go ahead it's it's crc rum spring so if you want to rebel go ahead and do that and so i start reading start kind of thinking okay do i want to be a christian so i start reading the gospels and i was immediately frustrated by the gospels because they didn't seem to be talking to anything in my life but now the longer that i think about it jesus through those stories was reprogramming the world and of course even even the story layer doesn't quite hit all the layers down and so what was even more clear was that even though the disciples didn't understand jesus at all he was reprogramming them yeah and and so then that gets me to the question okay what happened in pentecost because in my old frame of let's say cartesian dual substances there's a material substance and a spiritual substance but basically through your work i'm seeing that as not a helpful way to imagine the spiritual world yeah i think that i think that what happened in pentecost is what happened at the beginning of genesis like in the creation of adam so basically what you have is something like christ came and then gathered a body together and also gave them all the information and so he gave them all this information and then they gathered and they gathered but they didn't have yet what it took to to be alive and and then pentecost is the moment in genesis where god blows air into adam's nostrils and and makes all those disparate elements come together and so you can understand it as a in my discussion with guy seng talk i talk a little bit about my experience of that where it's like i grew up in a more kind of evangelical background where we had all the bible stories but i i didn't i never felt like you said that there was any that it was almost like arbitrary it was like here's this story which is true but it but it has an arbitrariness to it and so there are all these stories from all the from the and they try to really try it hard to find morality tales and these old testament stories because they're really hard to if you see them that way man you're going to struggle because a lot of those old testament stories are very little uh morality tale to them uh but so all these stories are there and then when something happens at some point where it's like the curtain opens up and then all of this information all of this this conglomeration of things joins together and becomes a body so i think that that's what happened at pentecost it's it's like they received the holy spirit the the the the breath of god blew down and they became an actual body which and and that included several things it included that they cohered together uh it included that they stopped being afraid right because they they had confidence they had they trusted in what why they were together uh and so the all the elements of what makes something one kind of came down upon them and so you know and so so peter stood up in a kind of leadership position and and then then because they had this kind of coherence they also but at pentecost the thing about pentecost is that it's both a coherence and a kind of wild multiplicity goes all it like fills up everything because it it both has them coming together understanding what this was all about from the beginning you know cohering as a group but then having the capacity to reach the end of the world like going and speaking in a way that can be understood by anybody who is there to understand right uh tonga fire right the idea that they can speak they can speak multi into multiplicity and so it really is like this cosmic event where like you said it's the the program the reprogramming that christ was doing started to bear fruit in this body that he had accumulated and then it started to grow and it started to it started to lay itself out you know in in in time and it and and the way it laid itself out was people imitating christ and understanding that the martyrs are the seeds of the church and this is like an actual reality that if if people who die for who die like people who who would end up dying for christ would create little seeds that would go in and then bodies would accumulate around those seeds and then the church just started to grow and to grow and to transform to transform reality both in terms of ideas but but even physically like geographically the geography of of the world changed as the christianization happened like cities started to manifest around uh martyrdom sites and and all of the whole political sphere started to be transformed as these new sacred spaces were being installed you know and then constantinople was the biggest deal of that where you know people always say rome fell it's like rome fell because constantinople grows in glory too it's not just it's not just that rome fell is that this this new city this christian city would never which never had a pagan temple uh became the new center of the world so so i think that that's the that's that's it like pentecost is such a wonderful image of of how reality works it just shows you it's it's a real instantiation of a new creation you could say it that way well it's well that leads so many interesting places because i mean this continues to happen in christianity in in that i mean the center of mass the people do these weird masks about the center of mass of christianity and unlike islam and a number of other major ruled world religions that they they basically continue to have sort of where their center is is where their center always has been christianity it just moves around the globe and i mean in africa and in asia and in latin america although latin america is a very interesting story because of the roman catholic and then the evangelicals but um i so so having said that to come back to to what we mentioned first what is happening right now through the symbolic world and through bridges of meaning discord and through youtube i think i i you know i don't know did you think your channel would get this large i don't think that way like i just don't i don't plan that way my life my whole life is not is never in that sense i just kind of do the things that are there uh and try to do them fully and that's that's usually the way that i i approach things so to me what i see let's say what i hope i can tell you what i hope out of this is i kind of i think that this i the way i talked about this before with with a few people which is that this is the future like the the the symbolic world view whether you you frame it exactly the way that i'm framing it or that or whether you frame it you know in terms of the way that john vervicky frames it in terms of cognitive science or if you frame it the way that ian gilchrist frames it in terms of you know you know the the right right hemisphere kind of global vision all of this is the is the future and i think a lot of people are realizing it right and so what i but it's also the thing is that it's also one of the things that brought bringing that are that is bringing about some of the madness around us the fact that symbolism is coming back into into the world and manifesting strongly is is one of the things that is also causing the craziness of the frame shift in media for example and so one of the things that people are understanding is how framing information is more important than information and everybody now is seeing that right because of because of the way that even just the way your your election happened was crazy like the things that they that they decided to report on and the things they didn't decide to report on and the way that they frame the the what's happening is more important than any information that's there so everybody's seeing that and some people are taking advantage of it and then creating very weird ideological clicks and creating weird new social rituals and you know even a lot of the covet stuff has a weird relate uh religious tone to it you know in terms of also the the the blm protests and all of that had a lot of religious overtones to it so this is it like you're not going to stop this and although the new atheists can whine all they want they're not going to stop it it's religion's coming back it's coming back and now the question is how is it going to come back you can't stop it and so what what i hope is that in speaking into this kind of frenetic transformation that's going on that that that we can help create stable places or stable people people that have enough vision and enough centeredness that they can act as seeds in their own communities that they can go back into their church and help their church prevent from going crazy because it's it's gonna get worse it's gonna just keep getting worse and so be part of the people that are helping their churches just to not go crazy that they they can go back and it doesn't necessarily have to be a church but in their communities helping them prevent the the madness that's going on by having a balanced vision of this heaven and earth hierarchy in all its aspects both the negative and positive understanding you know the role of the margin understanding the role of the center and then seeing all of this as this as the necessary part of the cosmos and so that's what i hope and and i don't know if it's going to i don't want it i definitely don't want it to become this weird kind of inner discussion too much where we're all talking amongst ourselves and we're all kind of happy that we understand things you know and and and winking at each other because we can see that other people don't get it that that's not what i don't want to be that's not what happens you know i really i really hope that it's going to produce fruits into in uh in the world which is why like which is why if you on the symbolic world we started a blog and uh i wanted people to kind of train themselves to write on symbolism and and uh you know i'm gonna start to probably appear on some of the youtube channels of the different people on the symbolic world uh facebook group just to kind of help people train them to get a little army of symbolic thinkers that that can then go into their own domains and and start to have fruit you know that's what i hope and at least at least that that's what i that's that's would be the if you could boil down what i'm doing to one thing i think that's probably probably it well i think your i think your emphasis on on community and on in real life community is is vital no i i i think that's right and part of what i see i i had the thought a couple of days ago that i wonder if say the period from the last five hundred years as charles tarellos talks about i wonder if 200 years from now that will be looked back upon as a dark age and find the find the um embracing of the world the word enlightenment to be horribly ironic i think so i definitely think so and and i think you know as a i think a lot of churches i mean this is i mean what you're describing is happening in churches because the i mean my own little church the this this certain way of the certain way of doing churches dying that has been the dominant paradigm in in protestantism at least i mean the catholics have always kind of gone through their own transformations and of course the orthodox are are coming online in north america in a i think in a growing way but the how this how then the church how this changes church for people i think will be profound and i i don't know what it looks like i really don't know what it looks like i i i understand that i think it's the one thing it's not going to look like and i hope and i don't think it's possible and i don't even want that is that one thing it's not going to look like is a bunch of people like for that in my case like a bunch of people who understand these things because that's not that's not understanding for example symbolism is really not that important like it's important now because we're in a weird upside down kind of end of civilizations period but in normal normal world you don't need to understand it you have to enact it you just have to be inside and enact it and so so what i what i'm hoping is that the people that are kind of influenced by by what's going on these discussions about meaning and everything can then go back in their world and then produce other things not symbolic discussion but rather you know help people live the liturgy better help people live the the you know help people see the value of their stories you know and then also create new versions of old stories and and uh and get people involved in that and so to me that's the that'll be the the key you know and also just the excitement the excitement about scripture and the excitement the the the feeling also like the sense of confidence about how true this is you know in a different way than what the materialists have said which is kind of crumbling and always fraught i think that that that's going to be that can be infectious as well because and i've seen it like i've talked to some of the old pastors that i grew up with who are kind of very materialist and and if i talk about it in the right way if they see in my eyes that i love the bible that i really love scripture and that it's like i am so excited about scripture and about all the potential all the stuff in there that you haven't totally seen yet and then like and i'm talking about the relationship between you know the garden and the temple and and i'm showing them the pattern how it how it you know like let's say like how i laid out pentecost for you just before like i've noticed that that gets people excited you pastors who who have been studying scripture for a very long time they don't feel threatened by it if you present it in the right way and so it's like that that type of excitement and uh i think that that that can be that can be wildfire you know and then it can be transmitted and but it's not necessarily going to happen in a in an explanation of what these things mean in the end participation well and i think that's part part of the you know part of the deception that's happening on these screens and in these little frames on smartphones and computer monitors and televisions i i think is that through this medium we can only we can only do certain things and one of those things are conversations about symbolism or we can only do certain things in this little frame and the real frame that things have to happen in are the the incarnational frame of okay what does it mean to be uh faithful to your wife and to build a community and to um to to actually have logos shape and colonize and and reform all the materiality around us and and i think this is part of the reason that it's critical that you're an artist because even though well maybe now you're sort of well known as someone who explains rudolph and vampires yeah um the you know what what you're i mean iconography is is is iconographic itself and that's you know that's i'm okay i've come from an iconoclastic tradition and so you know this is there's a little bit of this dissonance involved in this for me but it's the it's the practice of the the church i mean leslie knew again had this had this great quote the um the church is the hermeneutic of the gospel yeah in in that okay what why did um why was jesus able to conquer the roman empire in 300 years through his spirit because the holy spirit is the spirit of christ it's also the spirit of the creator i mean it's that's why you have a trinity and how was jesus able to conquer the roman empire in 300 years and the answer is the his pattern because no one of us can fully manifest the the full pattern of christ but the pattern of christ gets manifested in these communities and in their life and in what they do and always you know always in a limited way always but but yet sufficiently so that it it literally toppled the empire and that entire way of life and and again that's what that's what tom holland has been documenting that christ conquered the empire yeah definitely and it's wonderful to have that book it's such a great it's such a gift i really i was reading it while i was cheering and i while i was carving and i was cheering in some of the places like i was like yes i can't believe i'm so happy that he's saying this and he's saying it so well way better than i could ever say it so so yeah i totally agree in terms of of the the embodiment and it's it's really like for me it's a lesson i need to make sure that i say that because i it's like i you know i have if people who follow me carefully have seen that i've talked about my own alienation towards kind of french canadians and their um and their rejection of christianity and so it's like i'm also i also know like i know and i feel it in front of me like i feel it in front of me that i need to be involved like physically bod embodied involvement in this this this place where i am i need to be more involved because or else my soul and my body and spirit are going to start to split apart because here i am saying these things online but i'm also have this thing that i need to heal in my life where i need to to now kind of dive in and be and be like a french canadian person in this society that is that is acting and and and being involved so so it's like i this is like the next step for me and i know that it's it's coming because next year this is going to be next year especially because we won't be able to travel anyway so it's like all of god is putting it's like this is in front of me this is it jonathan no more like uh you need to you need to live by what you say that's that that's true that's true it also strikes me as i mean part of what's happening in the world via this technology and the internet is that i mean it's there's always kind of a both sides and i've been thinking about empire and what oh i mean we we we're near we nearly have a one world culture in some ways because of the internet and so and that is corrosive you know i so the french canadian the french canadian-ism that came about because of the you know because of the way the way that the waves happen in north america by different european countries that created something and and part of what the internet is doing is sort of you know reducing all texture in the world and yeah and and but it's but there's always this tension there's always this tension in an evangelism that you know it's the one in the many and i think again your your your symbolic vision has been really helpful for me to kind of manifest that that there was always something at the heart of protestantism which was an a which was an unhelpful uniformity that by virtue of the let the earth bring forth let the seas bring forth there's a healthy diversity and a multiplicity in that that that god affords and that christ affords but that a certain protestant vision of the world tends to yeah but i think it's more i think it's a western thing because it happened it happened also it wasn't just protestantism like if you look at the way that the latin church uh enforced itself on on england for example and how latin was enforced in in the celtic lands you can see that there's a strange thing that happened in the west that even in catholicism and then in the counter reformation the council of trent was like this massive like uniformization of the of the liturgy uniformization of of the you know of latin kind of just going all the way into to to anywhere that catholicism was so there's something about the west which has this desire to create uniform systems um and then which obviously then goes into everything else like in terms of in terms of in terms of how we view government and how you know you can look at the way that the different ref the different revolutions happen and how there was this desire to to kind of you make education uniform make language everybody's before napoleon not no one spoke french in france like this french idea came from napoleon just enforced one version of french on the entire on the entire country but before that it was all local dialects and local languages so there's something about western culture which has which which does that uh you know and i don't know like people will trace it to to to whatever they want to but it's it's not i don't think this is necessarily a protestant thing in the orthodox tradition it's like a weird tension right it has its positive and its negatives like it has a it has a positive because they tend to translate like they'll translate right away when they converted the russians they translated everything into they actually created the slavonic language and then they translated everything into slavonic uh you know they created a written version of the language that was spoken there and so then they developed their own thing i guess and that kind of happened all over the place but in protestantism that's part the parasitism has the two extremes because it also has the extreme variety like radical variety where the translating of the bible in every single tribal dialect that you can imagine you know it's like a goal and then you have all these all these idiosyncratic versions of of christianity all over the place of the world so it's like it's like a i think the west has like the radical the two radical sides of like total enforcement and then just like this brief role i guess something like that i would i was yesterday on the so we have this little open studio and and sally jo came in she's an artist and she she came in and she said i tried to have a conversation with a protestant about art in church and and i i almost wanted to hide under the desk because i i knew exactly where this was going because this this gets into this question of the one and the many because it gets into this this question of when you start when you when you start instantiating a vision in in visual media there's a power there that in some ways preachers kind of get to sidestep by keeping everything verbal yeah and you know when i i mentioned that when i went down to nicaragua i went down to nicaragua during the sandinista revolution and more radical college days and there was you know they had these revolutionary churches where you had sandinista rebels hanging on crosses uh nude with these huge phalluses and i mean it's i i i'd really you know and when sally joe was talking to me about okay so you know if you had okay so a how do you represent now we're in the um we're in the season of advent now heading towards christmas how do you represent the story of mary and joseph visually and you know and to me it's a big deal like even in the orthodox tradition like that's a big deal well that's why i said you got to talk to pejo because you know immediately when you raise this it is a huge deal and when i look at your story yeah i mean that that's why i don't think you should be too bashful about your story because this you yourself were the matter in which all of these stories came down and and manifest themselves and this and this struggle of you know sally joke said quite rightly she said you know all these protestants are resisting are resisting the visual arts but they still have to do architecture and so they're still manifesting in their architecture in their liturgy and their music in all of these ways they're still manifesting culture they just sort of have a willful she didn't quite say it this way but they have the sort of willful blindness about it that if we construct our campus to look like a junior college we can sidestep the question of if we're going to have mary and joseph rolling into cleveland in a in a 96 honda because once you once you locate mary and joseph in a visual art medium you have questions of race of class of of nationality you know we have all of these layers that get manifest in a visual medium and and when i look at what you've done you've said basically okay i'm going to go to the traditional and and you know when i remember your story that's a big deal for you because what was happening in other ways is that people were you know okay we're going to put san anisto rebels up on a cross and i mean so i'm really curious about what to do with this because yeah this is at the heart of what we're struggling with you have to so you have to kind of see it as if you see the tradition as as this kind of organic living thing that that almost like you can almost use weird evolutionary terms like to talk about it where it's like there are propositions and and there there are propositions and then some are kept and some are discarded so there's a there's a system of weeding and weeding in weeding out that happens and then sometimes someone proposes something which is a little too radical and then maybe like a church council or a local council has to kind of smack it down right uh and and then another someone produces something which is actually extremely powerful and then maybe the authorities will nudge people in that direction and will say like there's a for example like the russian church one one time said you should make images like uh like now is my my his his name is not gonna come to me uh like rublev you should make images like rublev and so they actually named an artist and said you should make images that copy his his style uh and and so what happens is because it's like a theological process then what ends up being kept ends up being extremely theological because there's like this organic process of weeding in and weeding out you know uh and then some and so then when you want to propose something different you always have to look and try to understand why is it this way why why do we show things this way rather than another way because it's like the whole idea of like not removing fences like even if you don't understand why it's that way you should probably respect it because a lot of energy and a lot of uh you know a lot of energy went into it by a lot of people it's not just someone who someone probably did come up with it but then the fact that it was preserved and that it was slightly modified through time then it ends up being so i think that that's a good way to understand why traditional images have the power they do and why they're really a good starting ground to understand how to represent things visually and so like for example in terms of mary and joseph a good a good thing that you would you will notice if you look at orthodox icons is that they'll never show mary and joseph uh like a couple like you know those images of the holy family that's not orthodox like orthodox orthodox that when you see every time you'll see an orthodox person maybe making one of those you'll get a bunch of a bunch of angry comments like people are not happy about showing joseph's arm around mary and like so you have joseph's arm around mary and then you have baby jesus in her in her arms and so it's like if you understand what images do like images suggest meanings like they they're not arbitrary right so if you suggest a sexual relationship between joseph and mary you're actually calling into question the virgin birth like ultimately you're calling that into question and so like the the image of the image of nativity is actually pretty scary for some people because the nativity icon shows joseph outside the cave like wondering what's going on like not understanding what's happening and mary is is inside the cave alone and she was helped by you know by uh by uh what's the name of by women like there's women who helped her give birth it's not joseph like there's no way in the world that in 2000 years ago a husband would help his wife or a man would help his wife give birth such a modern thing to think about that and so but there's a reason why they do that because they really want to avoid anybody thinking that joseph is the father of jesus in every way like you can't have anything suggesting that and so it's it's a theological decision and it can it can offend our sensibilities because we want to show the family right right but there's something higher that is more important than just showing a nice happy family right which is this idea that christ is the son of god i i i laugh because i google google's getting off of google music and so now i'm playing around with youtube music and just yesterday i was thinking okay i'm just gonna i'm just gonna search for uh christian popular christian christmas music 2020. and you know there's all these again what struck me was there's all you know a lot of this is evangelical music and so many of these attempts are okay let's let's show let's show joseph and mary and jesus as the dare i use the word iconic nuclear family yeah that's the way people want to present it but it's a it's a it's a bad move it's a really bad move i think theologically to do that there are find other there are other families that you can find to to do that i guess but it's not it's not it's not a good move [Laughter] jonathan no no no you don't have to apologize but to me it's it's symbolism happens and you know part of part of what i struggle with is say looking at the orthodox looking at orthodox representations i wonder i mean our first conversation you asked me how was your liturgy and i told you it was a mess and i still hold to my answer because it continues to be a mess but but part of what part of why it continues to be a mess is that i have i have lived such a such a multicultural life so my on my father's side my ancestors were jews who probably left spain uh found you know fled to the netherlands which was sort of a place of tolerance um you know one of the one of the guys on our discord server is a um was a was an ultra-orthodox jew and he did some genealogy i shared some genealogy says well you've got a bunch of distant relatives who are prominent rabbis in israel and it's like that's hilarious and so i you know then you know a number of generations back my great-great-great-grandfather start marrying dutch girls and my great-great-grandfather sends my great grandfather to america to western michigan to assimilate with the dutch and my grandfather becomes a minister and my father becomes a pastor in a black community and i work in the dominican republic and then come to this multi-everything community in sacramento in a dutch calvinist religious tradition in the world the world is such a blender and and i think part of all of these all of these strains do not disappear and so the question then becomes how how do all of these patterns find a degree of harmony in christ that blesses the world you know and i see some of you know i i don't know obviously your life to the same resolution that i don't mind but young man raised in an evangelical context obviously i mean you spoke with guy about your father and and the ways that you've spoken about him before you know a a a good man and a christian man you you go on this your own journey of exploration and wind up you know you spend some time in congo you wind up you know now in in orthodoxy but part of what i you know when i talked to i talked to a guy in my my channel burn power who is an american who grew up jesus people in california then moved to new york city so he could be in the music and art scene and then moved to alaska and now is living in tbilisi georgia and so i asked him about orthodoxy there and he talked about because um george is one of the you know a deeply orthodox country and so i talked to him about some of these issues and orthodoxy in america is going to be a different thing and part of what happens in america is there sort of a there's sort of a ghetto phase and maybe the french canadian is kind of a a really large ghetto my only experience there i visited i've visited montreal once when i was young and we were at some sort of an amusement park and and i was in line for some rides and some french-speaking kids didn't treat me real well so there's there's what's back in my lair yeah but but what i see happening in terms of these these dual tensions of globalization which sort of sort of reduces individuality into this broad consumer culture yet the the contextual the textuality of every different place and every different story i'm i'm deeply interested in in in what the orthodox church is going to look like in this context because it will be very different from what you find in tablesi georgia yeah for sure and i think that's inevitable um the orthodoxy definitely in america has a protestant flavor especially the convert type orthodox that's just it just happens you know it's it's hard to avoid that um and that can actually have some positive elements you know because the rigidity let's say of systems like like in any system can be a danger for a a highly hierarchical system like orthodoxy it can be a it can be a problem and and that's i think some of the things that led to the revolution were the problems inherent in in these types of of the structures you know where you have corrupt individuals who nonetheless remain in power and then you know use the church to their own and then all the kind of stuff that led to the reformation too you know that the stuff that led to the reformation was real like there really were all these problems i i don't want to even though i i tend to not side on the side of the reformation i i can recognize the reasons why people were angry you know and so i think in america there's a fascinating thing where the kind of protestant flavor it it it gives an energy which is really good you know and it gives also a uh a love of scripture and a desire to be it's a desire to not take things lightly like to not take the way that protestants are like serious protestants don't take scripture lightly you see the same with people who who are orthodox in america where it's like they don't take the co they don't take liturgy lightly they don't take the the church fathers lightly they tend to to really want to get down to the bottom and not just gloss over things um and i think that that that can be that can be useful sometimes it creates a kind of rigorous weird rigorism that is there too in america in the in the certain orthodox convert groups where they're extremely rigorous like super super rigorous and you know it's like they they know all the cannons of all the councils and they know all the all the things and they're they're they're extremely they try to be very very rigorous which which in my opinion is not it's not the best way to go but you know you need a bit of that too because or else it just everything gets floppy but so it is fascinating to watch and it's also very it's in the image of america it's a weird multicultural multiple and it's it's actually not how orthodoxy shouldn't have all these different churches right so it's like you know in in in greece there's a greek there's the orthodox church and there's the bishop and there are priests and there's the archbishop and whereas in america there's like the there's the there's the oca there's the russian uh rokkor church there's the antioch in church there's the greek church there's the ukrainian church and so romanian church so it's like it's it's actually a weird it's actually a weird a freaky thing where you have all these competing and parallel hierarchies kind of uh working together which is maybe in the image of america uh makes it even more in the image of america so and people can just like it's weird because like a lot of people a lot of people like they leave protestantism to become orthodox because they're like oh finally like i'm gonna be i'm gonna find the thing but then within orthodoxy they keep switching churches they keep going they'll go to the greeks then the russians then this and so they're still we're like they're still acting like protestants within orthodoxy because there's that capacity to like move from one hierarchy to the other if the one the one you're in doesn't suit you for some reason or whatever right it's almost it we won't know we've done something until we actually exercise this consumerist spirit that leaves the consumer at the heart you know that because that in many ways that i mean that's a deep problem in protestant churches as well which has i've seen that grow in the christian reformed church 50 75 years ago you were a member of a church pastors kind of came and went but the church was the community they they invested they held they cared and pastors sort of were role players yeah and in america you know the celebrity pastor is the heart and then the people act like consumers which means that there's no actual community yeah and there's there's also like the service church you know where it's like i go to that church because it has a good youth group it has a good this it has you know it's like you you look at the menu that the church offers and then you you see oh well the church has this this this this and so it's like i'll go there because it has this it has you know it it has the options that i like you know and so that's obviously that's seriously a difficult it's it's so hard to break free from that because we're so used to it it's almost so it's ingrained in us to see ourselves as as consumers that it's it's hard well it's a manifestation of what's at the center right that's right all right these are at the center and and church and god and the world are you know here to serve me it's so completely opposite the heart of the gospel yeah well to swing back then again to the symbolic world bridges of meaning these channels because well and because you know when you ask that question i mean part of and i was i started making videos partly because i watched i watched jordan basically cut a hole through the fabric you know maybe that wasn't the right image maybe i saw him create huge ripples in the pond yeah and i watched um you know someone recently had a tweet where they said you know first i listened to sam harris then i listened to jordan peterson then verveiki and pajeo and vander clay and now i'm thinking about being a christian i blame sam harris that's right does the layers i love that tweet that's so funny and it's just it's like i've heard i mean i'm sure it's the same with you i've gotten so many messages of people that have that story very similar yeah but then but then the question is part of the reason i started making videos was as a pastor i knew that jordan's sort of moving through the zeitgeist as a televangelist with his books and his videos people um you know disturbing people they're having new insights and then they start looking around for you know all very intuitively where can i keep going and i knew that when you when you do this to people okay let's say you let's use jesus parable if you clean the house if you don't fill it with something that vacuum you know will attract other things into the house and so part of why i got into this was i knew that a vacuum was being created and i you know i didn't know to what degree i could help but i wanted to at least give people something okay you're interested in the bible here's you know let's let's keep talking about this because you the bible can go a lot of weird ways as protestants yeah generally and not just that but it's like you can see it like you've you've seen the you've seen the moments you've seen the moments of like douglas murray saying this would be a good time to make up a new religion you can see brett weinstein talking about creating and we talked about this with adam friended this wanting to create like a superstructure that would manage all the other structures and so there is this this desire in this void to say well we're going to build the tower and uh you know it's going to it's going to reach heaven and so it's a it's actually you're right in a way it is a dangerous time you know especially even the psychedelic stuff also you can see that it's like we're gonna fill this void with psychedelics or some weird version of like a new religion with psychedelics or something um and aliens and alien aliens interdimensional beings fall right and so and so i think that i think that you're right i think that we that we it's our responsibility and it's our we have to if we had this weird opportunity that was you kind of almost thrust upon us to kind of talk into it and to hopefully be a little nudge of people to go back into the story that we're still in like we're still in this story it's not the story isn't gone or at the we might be you know towards the fringe of it but it's still the story so well and and and that leads me into you know your question i mean two things have sort of developed around us i look at the symbolic world and you've got a blog i really love jp marceau's follow up on the miracles conversation that i had with verveiki and and the lewis conversation but the you know some some people out there say well you need to you know paul you're you're starting a new church and it's like no that is not what i want to start um and and i i really appreciate the fact that you're orthodox for that reason because you're in that way even further from the protestant impulse of every new ripple in the pond starts a new denomination and which which there's a there's something which is deeply problematic about that so but there's something about the fact that you i think the fact that you you follow louis i think that that's one of the effects that lewis has had uh is to point people back to their christian roots without starting a new thing without saying like i'm gonna start a new movement or a new church or a new a new denomination um and so i think the fact that you place yourself kind of firmly in lewis's footsteps i think that's a good sign like it's a good sign that that you're you're not trying to start a new like a new protestant denomination but rather just help people move through their own struggles and their own crisis their own meaning crisis so that they then go back in their communities you know get involved how how serious i mean part of what tom holland impressed upon me is the you know my denomination and well and orthodoxy too i mean there's a strong antithesis element to christianity where you're in or you're out and that's you know that's that that is not going away but part of what tom holland's work talks about is the latent the latent christianity even in celebrity atheists around us yeah and you know part of what i'm at least dealing with and i think you probably are too if i read the comments on your videos correctly we're dealing with a lot of people who i had a conversation with poe the person from the uk and and they're they're sort of in the there's some in the reiki camp is sort of that they're a little more comfortable with the woo um [Music] and the new ageish stuff and the circling and you know the reiki camp is over there but there's still another element over over here who are the engineers and you know verveiki just feels a little scary um and they they're saying boy i really need something in my life like a church but you know and and and so pastorally i'm trying to figure out and and in some ways the discord server for me i just did a couple of conversations with a guy named topher from from toronto people are working through this stuff and um and like topher's topher was that's sort of where my estuary concept has has come in because people are working through this stuff and they need a space to they need a they need a space where they can play with things and have permission to play with things and that's always a dangerous space for people to be in but it's usually a necessary space for people to grow yeah and i think but i think that that's it and i think that that's the best that the online thing can offer us and it's important to see that we you know it's a place where change can it's a place where exploration and transformation can happen you know because it is it is a safe it's like it's a little it's it's kind of this exploration but kind of safe exploration because you're just sitting at home right you're on a screen and you're listening to things you're watching things and so i think that that's a great it's a great thing if you can offer that to people and the opportunity to to discuss in a safe like a not safe in the in the kind of safe space idea but in a with people that they feel are are at least asking similar questions and you know and so i think that that's i think that's great like i dropped into the to the bridges uh meaning uh to oh as as like this boomer that doesn't know how discord works and i'd like drop into conversations and if you were like jonathan is here but then my mic wasn't on and then i i saw like they were just thought i was just and it was just weird but like i've seen some great some just some great discussion and and uh and a lot of people getting involved and helping each other and giving people giving each other advice and uh and so it's a i think it's a i think that it can it really can nudge people to in the right direction that's for sure but like you said there are we just need to i think we need to be careful not to think that not to let it become like a new religion or a new or or uh you know a new centralized thing that that uh but but that's yeah i think that i think at least i trust you like i don't think you're gonna i don't i don't think you're gonna next time i talk to you you're gonna be wearing a new funny hat with like uh with some kind of liturgical clothing and then you'll be archbishop paul of the the church of bridges or something you know like i just it's not possible i i mean who knows but i don't see it so so i think we're fine i think you you shouldn't worry too much about that stuff well what do you what do you want to do with the symbolic world i mean this has it's it's a blog it's your videos um you've got a facebook group where you have discussions i mean where where do you want this thing to go so to me what i see is i see this as a like a training ground and so what i see what i notice is i see people who watch my videos and are starting to think in terms of symbolic symbolic thinking and so they they all they are these people that are thinking that way that have the capacity to do so i see it that they need to kind of play with it and experiment and and test it against other people and so the facebook group seems to be doing that and it's it's doing it without me like i don't even run that you know it's it's being run by jacob russell and and a few other people and and so i can see people propose symbolic ideas and then then you have people adding and testing and wondering about what they're saying um and so that's what i see and the same with the blog is i want to it's like it's like a training ground for symbolic thinkers that i hope will then go back into their own communities and produce fruits and and help others embody it also create stories a mix of understanding and production like having artists create new things you know and also being sensitive to the the propaganda and culture and how you know they use symbolic they use they they kind of distort symbolic language to to to influence society um so that's what i see i really do see it that way as a as a as a kind of little little army like a little army of symbolists that will then go back into their own world and have effect a little army of symbolism little army of symbolism how do you feel about being a leader i really don't feel like a leader i i wish i i don't i think that i i've actually maybe to the dismay of some i've actually kind of not been too involved on the on the on the facebook group like i'll like things you know and i'll write a few comments but i i i try not to be too involved just because i really don't want people to follow me because i feel like it just doesn't make any sense like i'm online for goodness sake like you don't know me if people don't know me people can't see all my my foibles and my problems and everything so i really don't uh i really don't i don't i really don't see it that way so hopefully i can point people back to their own authorities like in the church something like that yeah yeah yeah well good uh we've you've been gone you are a leader though and is that what you think no you are that's um but it's you know this this gets into my questions about this whole space and about what youtube is and about what can be accomplished in a facebook group or on a discord server and about the this is this is two-dimensional and if people i i keep trying to emphasize this with people that nothing too dimensional is real enough and and so you might participate in a in on a discord server in a facebook group and you might watch you might watch a youtube channel and you might grow from i certainly want that but it does have to manifest in three dimensions in time in locality and any we yeah we we have to we have to come to terms with the limitations of this medium so that we really resist the distortions it creates yeah oh i think you're right i think it's a good call for all of us people watching and then us as well both you and i to be attentive to that and to be careful it's a it's definitely a minefield because you have to be honest like if i when i if i receive comments of people thanking me for what i'm doing it's like that's that man that goes straight right up to up right up to the to the ego and so it's it's a dangerous it's always like a dangerous situation and uh so hopefully god protects us from from uh from pride in that in that moment but uh yeah but i think that the like i said the the the fact that i'm seeing people kind of take it on take on their own like i love to see what jp maxwell's doing i think that he's just such a great character coming up like we've had some wonderful people writing for the blog recently that i think you know there's a for someone who's named richard rowland who wrote an article about saint dionysus the areopagite well he's now like becoming the co-host of the amon sewell podcast which is about tolkien and orthodoxy and so it's like seeing these people kind of move out and you know not like they're only but they were in this discussion about symbolism and then starting to kind of apply it in other fields and and uh that's what excites me more than anything you know and so that's what i hope to see you know i i starting the church of the church of jonathan or something it's the pejorian church the pejoey and the pashoens [Laughter] it's good that that doesn't roll off the tongue huh it's actually probably pretty good for joey and it doesn't sound right well it's but it is a tale of warning because both luther and calvin would have been horrified by the fact that there are religious traditions named after them you know there should not be lutherans there should not be calvinists and the apostle paul makes that clear in the book of corinthians yeah and but but that is that is a that is a natural thing that is the natural way we use labels but um i don't know i i feel the same way i look at the discord server and i look at job and jeff and luke and sherry and andrea and i see leaders that you cannot you cannot have a healthy community without leaders who who manifest usually different things in the community but around which the community coheres and when things start going off to the side they're the ones who who pull it back say no we're not going to do that we're going to do this we're not going to talk that way we're going to talk this way and and that you know then the community starts to cohere and grow and to become a place where a place where people can can change and be formed by christ and what's what's so interesting is is that you know job job you can watch job's conversion with my conversations with him over time you can see elements of it and and and none of us are fully formed but the formation is happening and the the the witness to the former is manifest in the forming process and we're watching that happen and that's tremendously exciting so yeah yeah well good it's a good note to to end and i i i really i really enjoy our conversations and for sure i really feel like we're we're on similar paths and we're kind of we can learn from each other as well i've been spending more time on your channel especially in the past month or so and so and so i i think we need to continue our our ongoing discussions i agree i agree and and again i i it sounds terribly fanboyish but i i i do think well let me say it this way um i've been watching this migration in my own denomination in church planters for a while long before the jordan peterson thing or long before i knew your name and i'm i'm seeing so so this isn't just idiosyncratic jonathan pajot who somehow you know caught a wave this is this is this is a bigger movement by the spirit in the world that we are you know we we are participating in and but your work has has been tremendously helpful to me to um to sort of get beyond a dual substance model into a vision which is i think is which is more unifying and i think actually more biblical so i um keep doing what you're doing because it's uh it's i think it's really important stuff so well thanks for the encouragement paul and uh enjoy i hope you're moved to the to the old house goes well yeah this is it people i this is this this sunday i'm moving i'm moving on sunday into my house that was flooded a year and a half ago and so we're really excited about that and uh yeah i'm that's pretty much all i can think about right now it's very difficult to think about anything else well and i i hope covid relents and maybe september 2021 i can meet you in thunder bay that'd be awesome i would love that happens so yeah all right jonathan it's great to talk to you take care bye-bye
