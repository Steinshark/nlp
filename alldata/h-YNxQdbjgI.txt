you have to celebrate Christmas right it's not just enough to believe that the child born of a virgin was the logos from before the ages we can say we believe that or we want to but if we don't act on that information some way and the way that you act on this information Taylor talks about liturgy and like let's say he talks about the feast the act of Celebration as being like a song right so the song has a Melody think of like a little Melody has qual moments you know all these different notes and everything but really the beginning to the end of that song all happen in the same moment because it's a unit so if you don't sing the song you have no way of participating in it in that moment the moment just passes You by right and if you don't celebrate Christmas then the moment this holy moment right this moment when Heaven and Earth everything comes together into this point that moment just passes You by and pretty soon you stop believing at all this is Jonathan Pedro welcome to the symbolic [Applause] world so hello everyone I am back here with Richard Roland for another episode of universal history as all of you know Richard and and I uh wrapped up a major course on baywolf where Richard took us to through very convincingly why baywolf is a Christian poem and if you watch it you'll see at the end I myself have a like a mouthy gape like he just at the end you there's no doubt it just like all comes together it's very beautiful so uh so you can still check that out by the way if you're interested the uh the course is going to stay on for sale on the website so you can check that out but today we are going to talk about Christmas about kind of how Christmas came together as a feast in the church why it's so important you know why we celebrate Christmas the way we do today and so uh it's gonna be it's gonna be a great episode thanks for coming on Richard glad to be here um this is uh one of my personal like hobby horses uh is is defending Christmas I'm a I'm a I'm a staunch uh veteran of the Christmas Wars um for a little context about this uh maybe some people remember if you were if you were like a fundamentalist Protestant especially living in the South like the southern us um I I like how Americans we say the South as this is the only South but I guess I guess people do that everywhere but anyway um but if you were living in the southern us you you might have been familiar like you might have grown up in like the worship Wars wars yeah uh so the worship Wars was like the big kind of like maybe you had this other places too I just didn't grow up there where you know was like do we do to like a praise band or a piano in hymns or like a piano in Oregon or you know there's kind of debate about this kind of stuff like my family was in the trenches of all that stuff when I was a kid but then uh as I grew up and eventually um you know was on pastoral staff for several years uh one day uh one day somebody came to me very upset and said well somebody's put up a Christmas tree in the like the foer of the church and I was like well I it's um it's December so we we do that every year and uh it kind of I was very I was uh totally uh flabbergasted you could say like like very caught off guard uh why would this be a problem and uh but that kind of that kind of uh initiated a multi-year I don't say struggle but but uh a period that I I sometimes kind of refer to my wife and I refer to as the Christmas Wars which had to do with which had to do with uh some people um not all just at that church but just like in our lives Etc uh really really going hard trying to get people to stop celebrating Christmas and it's the usual sort of stuff it's a it's a pagan holiday it's a it's to Catholic etc etc and uh so that is one of the things that caused me to like really dig my heels in and start studying um actually uh that was right before I started working on uh what eventually became a masters in essentially medieval literature right but it caused me to yeah like that was one of the things that got me to start like really dig my heels in and be like all right well if this is really a Roman Catholic thing then gosh darn it I'm gonna understand why you know you know as as opposed to just saying oh well that's Catholic so toss that so it's it's a weird it's a weird thing like studying and sort of fighting for the celebration of Christmas is actually probably why I'm Orthodox interesting in a weird way um that's like a part of my story that I don't think I've I've ever shared before publicly but but you know that's one of the things that got me to uh you know really think about what it means to have tradition and what it means to celebrate and there's a part of there was a part of my conversion experience that was certainly intellectual right but the much more important part was as we were converting as a family especially for my wife was the uh was the embodied part of it and for us actually really deciding we need to take not just Christmas but like Advent seriously and and do these certain things and then later on lent and Easter like deciding that we needed to to to find some way to make these times kind of special as a family and start participating this in a more embodied way was a really important turning point for our family it's interesting I just want to say something what you said it's interesting because the this holiday war that we see it's it's a strange place where secular atheist types and fundamentalists hold hands in their arguments and to be fair not all fundamentalists um because the again the family that I grew up in super big yeah but like some fundamentalist like really very particularly strain of of fundamentalist like I know a lot of people that were in that camp like anti anti- Christmas Camp when I was younger they ended up moving towards Jewish holidays ultimately yeah that's one of the things we'll talk about a little bit later um and actually for people who want to go back uh to last year's video last year we did a a video it was a sequel to the Groundhog Day video uh where we looked at the the four winter feasts of the the four Great Witter Feast of the church and kind of talked about how those are fulfillments of of Hanukah or the Festival of the rededication of the temple and the rededication of the Temple of the cosmos I'm not going to repeat myself on a lot of that stuff today because people can go back and watch that but so all this to say uh this is this is like a a it's a very you know passionate subject for me so I'm excited to to talk about it today so we're going to do this in two parts I want to talk about a little bit about how we got to have the kind of Christmas C celebration that we have today which is which is understanding that everybody you know different families do things a little bit differently broadly speaking there are certain things which if you live in North America and you celebrate Christmas there's certain things that you're you're doing that you're you're doing and you're doing them every year and even if you're not doing them you know some of them specifically they're all around you they're in all of the Christmas movies they're in all of the like the the you know you can't get away from it the grocery store the uh the the the Home Improvement store the the mall like all these things right you can't there's certain things you can't get away from so I want to kind of talk about how we got to that Christmas yeah and uh and then also look at some of the historical attempts to abolish Christmas and uh and what and then basically the second half of the video is talking about why that hasn't worked why is stick is Christmas so sticky that we can't seem to help ourselves when it comes to celebrating it so that's where we're going to go all right so I want to begin with uh just talking about the essence of the feast um this is you know in some respects the most obvious part and yet it's so it's it's weird because it's so obvious like we constantly feel like every year I mean you know six of my neighbors right now have a have a put you know keep Christ and Christmas kind of a thing out in their yard with the nativity scene and stuff and it's great I love it um um you know I I really love just all the statues of Jesus and Mary everywhere this time of year you know it uh it's great and um um I really am serious about that we we'll come to that in a a little bit um but I think it is actually kind of this beautiful return to tradition that you see happening you know even in you know the Deep South so yes it's a it's a unconscious return to tradition you know in very unsuspecting places and that has to do with that stickiness that we're going to talk about but but I just want to start with like the fundamental essence of the feast which I think will help us understand why it is as sticky as it is um and that it's it's the it's the ultimate expression of the pattern of the high becoming low right and and I know this is a pattern you talk about a lot people who are we were talking about this the other day right people who are like on this channel a lot or in the various discussions around this part of the internet think about this pattern a lot but this is the ultimate expression of this pattern right and it it what it does is it manifests this pattern you could say like more um evocatively than almost anything else except for the crucifixion yeah right right and so um I just want to read something real quick this is from you know uh uh this is from our our festal uh hymns for the feast in the Orthodox church but the this actually comes from uh this is just a setting into verse of a mostly already metrical homy or oration that that was given by St Gregory the Theologian um on the on the occasion of fop Nativity which as I'm going to explain in a moment used to be celebrated on the same day so this it says Christ is born glorify him Christ comes from Heaven go to meet him Christ is on Earth be exalted sing to the Lord all the Earth and praise him in gladness O people for he has been glorified to the son begotten of the father before all ages and incarnate of the Virgin without seed in these latter days to Christ Our God let us cry out you have raised up our horn holy Are You O Lord stem and flower of the root of Jesse you have blossomed from the Virgin o Christ from the mountain overshadowed by the forest that's a it's an image from the song of habak uh which the church traditionally ascribes to the Virgin Mary from the mountain overshadowed by the forest you have come made flesh from her who knew no man oh God not formed from matter glory to your power O Lord I Behold a strange most glorious mystery Heaven the Cave the true Throne the Virgin the manger a place where Christ lay the uncontainable god whom we magnify in song so this is like the the really the the the key kind of the center of our celebration and it comes from a much longer oration that St Gregory gave on this feast and he talks about a lot of things that are I really encourage people to go and read this you can find it in his fesal orations um uh the excerpt I was just reading there comes from a book called the the the winter PCA which is just a really great kind of of a reader written by father Thomas hopco back in the day on the various feasts of the of the winter season um and and each each chapter is like maybe two or three pages and there's 40 of them so um yeah it's a it's just a really lovely little reader but when he talks about a lot of things he talks about actually how should we celebrate the Feast don't celebrate it like the pagans that is with drunkenness we're going to talk about drunkenness specifically today because it comes up a lot as it happens in talking about historical celebrations of Christmas but not to celebrate it as pagans but instead celebrate it soberly as Christians uh by which of course St Gregory means go to church feed the poor right and and then you know yeah enjoy yourself as well but don't uh you know don't engage in the kind of Revel rates the pagans engage in um um and there's a lot of beautiful themes in this homy right the high becoming the lowest thing I mean there's nothing weaker or less uh less powerful than aw Jewish baby in the you know in the Roman Empire right you know this you don't get any weaker any poorer any less significant than that right um uh the the one of the other major images that we find in the ancient hymns both in the East and in the west is the um the uncontainable the idea of the something that can't be contained being contained right in the virgin in the manger and so on and then of course you know for us as Christians the the Deep significance which you'll find many of the church father is talking about of Christ being laid in a food trough yeah right as as you know like this is I mean it's very very sort of evident Eucharistic imagery right foreshadowing foreshadowing that so um and also images of like really images of the of the uh Arc of the Covenant there in that that text he wrote like between the cherubim and everything like yes understanding that there there's a relationship between the glory of God descending uh in the temple and Christ being born out of the virgin pretty yeah this is really important I mean like the most common Orthodox Hy about the theot toos is like the more honorable than the Cherub them right well to that to understand why that's not just a nice thing that we say because we like Mary right you really have to look at hymns like this hym of the feast right where we're saying right the Virgin becomes the cherubic throne right so like the the the cherim they carry the throne well but she's the throne right and that's why she's more honorable than than them right because she's the throne now and and she becomes the throne in like the most like earthy literal way possible yeah because J the baby is sitting in her lap right this is one of the earliest uh uh images that we have of the Virgin from the catacombs in Rome is this is the Adoration of the Magi right um and uh which is the which was originally by the way was originally the focus of the Christmas celebration in the west um we'll talk about we'll talk about how how Christmas gets um kind of split out from theophany and Epiphany in just a second and then of course one of the other major themes and again I just suggest people go back and watch that video we did last year one of the major themes here is the idea of the restoration of the Temple of the cosmos right and it's it's sort of Link it's ties to the Old Testament Feast of the restoration or the Festival of Lights what nowadays is called Hanukkah so um so that being said let me talk about the ancient Christian and medieval celebrations of the feast so originally Christmas and the or Christmas in epiphany epiphany in the West theophany in the East they have different emphases but they're the same feast and I'm just going to probably call it theophany the rest of our conversation but I'm really including both I mean the the the differentiation of emphasis is very ancient um as you know so theophany focuses mainly on the baptism of Christ Epiphany focuses mainly on the Adoration of the Magi yeah there was also like a I think that the idea of the early Feast was something like the Feast of of the revelation of light that's right that's right I mean that's the earliest that's the earliest thing like it's the Feast of light right the festival of light and of course when St Gregory is is is is delivering that Festival oration that's the occasion on which he's doing it yeah which is why like there's all while all those images come together right the moment when Christ is first recognized in the world so the Magi the the the the baptism but then also like the wedding of Kaa for example would be mentioned in those early feast and so like all these moments before Christ reveals fully the glimmer of light appearing in in in the Incarnation really like everything culminating up to the baptism right that that whole kind of episode which is where two of the gospels start right two of the gospels just began at the baptism um which is which is an important detail so yeah so originally this is all kind of one feast and actually in Armenian Christianity is still celebrated this way right all on one single feast what happens beginning in the mid fourth century is that uh the the celebration of Christmas gets to sort of split out from n from Epiphany theophany into two feasts uh which are 12 days apart and the reason for this is basically arianism so arianism is the uh it's the sort of you know the arch heresy as far as Christians are concerned right it's this teaching that the son was a creature that he was not eternally begotten um it's does not necessarily the teaching that uh Jesus wasn't God or Jesus wasn't Divine which is how some people will try to explain it sometimes because Aries actually did believe Jesus was divine he just believed he was like a Divine created thing like a like God or something like like like right a God right and it and of course this creates poly you know polytheism and various other problems for Christian theology um one of the permutations of aryanism is uh something called called apollinarianism which is basically this idea that um and there there are a few different versions of this right but it's basically the idea that Jesus was just like a normal good person and then at some point and most people who believe this set at the baptism that the lhost comes in and fills him right yeah we call adoptionism sometimes yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and and a lot of these things I mean there was like adoptionism and then arianism and then apollinarianism and a lot but I mean a lot of these things like intersect so much it's not totally important for our purpos today to like G out the individual most important to say that what was what became important for the Christians was to say that incarnate logos was incarnate from the moment of conception and not at not at some later point during the story so that's exactly how this becomes you know if you go back and and look at those those hymns that I just read right there's this talking about how the whole focus is on how Christ that is born in the manger that is being adored by the m right is already God before the ages worthy of our adoration right and in this context the gifts of the Magi which is the big focus of epiphany in the West becomes uh emblematic becomes the emblematic uh uh act of worship right this this of for the total giving of ourselves right where we have nothing to give to Christ but ourselves and I'll just say on this note there's a really wonderful series of like Prince I think they were done as originally as like postcards by an AR Nuvo artist name um I think it's edio anini and I probably got his name wrong but he was an Italian artist he did a series of like sort of postcard prints of like the various titles of the Virgin but one of them for the M Christi uh the mother of Christ he did the uh he does the Adoration of the Magi and it's one of my favorite images of the Adoration of the Magi because one of the things they have them doing is taking the the incense you know so you got the three gifts gold frankincense and myrrh right well so taking the frankincense and burning it in a sensor before the Christ child and I don't know why I never thought about that before I saw that image but of course I mean if you believe this is this is God before the you what do you do you what do you do when you come to a god or even like an emperor for that matter right you burn incense right it's an act of worship an act of veneration and so um uh it's anyway it's a really beautiful image and very evocative in that sense right so this is the big focus of Christmas right by celebrating it we're going to talk at the end of the video today about the importance of celebrating something why it's actually not enough to just think something correct but you actually have to celebrate it you have to embody it in some way right which by the way is something that that everybody knows yeah right even even the sort of like the the the the anti- culture right knows this right and that's why you have to have pride month and that's why you have to have celebrations you need not it's not just remove celebrations you have to replace with something that right exactly yeah so what happens pretty quickly is uh is that uh we start preparing for this great feast um with a period of preparation and so in the west this used to begin back on November the 11th um and in the east on November the 15th either way it's sort of a 40-day fast um in the west it was called St Martin's lent because it originated in the dases of Tours in France um so um if you came to the bolf class you will know I made a lot of jokes at the expense of the French but today I have only good things to say about the French so so uh yeah well it is Christmas Jonathan it is Christmas that's right yeah um I'm gonna have good things to say about Martin Luther as well so there you go yeah so um so if you go back and look at the sixth Century councils in the west starting in France uh the the Council of Tours and then kind of spreading around there it establishes Advent and Christmas tide as separate seasons and it seems like this was because uh people had started to like pre-celebrate a little too much right uh which is the thing we do in our culture now we're like well Christmas is on the 25th and we got to get all the Christmas parties the work Christmas party and the gym Christmas part all in before Christmas you get all in before Christmas right well this is apparently a very old problem and so uh and so what they did is they established they established these fasts as a way of making sure we're preparing properly and then also establish Christmas tide the time from Christmas to Epiphany or theophany as being as being a time of feasting right and so this is kind of how it takes the the general shape that it does so for instance the current Advent season on in the west which doesn't start on November the 11th it starts on December the 1st uh or like the first Sunday around there uh that that dates back to the late 6th century when uh monks were required to fast for the first 24 days of December and it seems like this was because they had been breaking into the Christmas Ale a little bit early that's right yeah they had their Advent calendar now that just has chocolate in it like people eat chocolate every I like the ones that have just like a little thing of a different Scotch whiskey in each of the doors there you go that's unfortunately I can't participate in these but uh but I think it's a neat idea so um but uh so there's a basic rule of thumb for understanding why different cultures have different Christmas traditions and that is the colder your winter is uh the bigger deal Christmas is in your culture right and that's that's more or less true across the board there's some exceptions to it uh but but put it another way the colder your winter is the more Christmas customs and traditions your culture will develop and like the stickier those things will be yeah and um because it's darker too right you have that sense of this dark moment when the into which Christ is born and i' by the way uh I've heard some people say something like sometimes well the Orthodox are really good at celebrating Pasa they just don't know how to celebrate Christmas or something like this but like go go to Ukraine go to Russia go to any of those like northern European countries where it gets very cold very dark right uh go to even like Serbia and and the Balkans you'll find all kinds of amazing Christmas carols Christmas traditions stuff you've never heard of stuff that's really similar to stuff you grew up with um so it really has a lot to do with the weather and particularly like you said the amount of Darkness that you have and uh I'll say a little bit here about the connections between um and we said a lot more about this in our last video so again go back and watch that people and in the Groundhog Day video as well but the connections between the connections between like Pagan Solstice celebrations and this is a thing that everybody has a winter festival absolutely if you have a winter you have a winter festival and I realize I'm talking kind of mainly about the Northern Hemisphere right now um I don't know what to do about that but um you know we can yeah it's sorry people in Australia like I don't I don't know what to say but or in South Africa South Africa or yeah yeah yeah right right um but uh basically like as the as the light Recs right you get to the deepest darkest part of the year and everybody has this deep um cultural it's sort of deeper than cultural actually like this really primitive uh sense that a festival is needed that light is needed right and um we have to light a bonfire we have to light we have to light the fire it's just inevitable to think that way yeah we have to find the light at least we have to like get some hope for for the sun to come back and this seems to be the main reason for people rejecting the idea that Chris that Christ might have actually been born on December the 25th because it makes so much sense because it makes too much sense like that's too perfect that goes together too well right um I would just say you know uh you know who made the agricultural cycle who made the seasons right right and and uh so so for me it's it's just this is when light would come into the world when else would it have happened right when else would it have happened and um so a lot of uh so all this to say if somebody says to me um such and such Christmas tradition you know like the Christmas ham or something like this that goes back to this old Germanic Pagan custom at Ule or something like like this okay all right are you coming over for dinner or what like you know let's you know um yeah that's that and and really that should not be a problem for us if you understand the way that these things work right um and uh so a lot of the Traditions that we associate with Christmas had already started developing by the late Middle Ages um uh uh one of my favorites here is car right uh and and here I have to say something which may upset some people um but I don't mean to all right and that is that a Carol is not the same thing as a him yeah nowadays in like Modern English Parliament when somebody says A Christmas Carol they just mean a a religious song that you sing at Christmas time right or a semi-religious song that you sing at Christmas time it's just like a Christmas song that's what we mean by Christmas Carol but carols are not the same things as uh as hns and in fact carols were not sung in church until about the later half of the 19th century really yeah not sung and and carols were not to be sung in church yeah yeah they're not they're not lurgical at all they're not lurgical and uh uh you've got to sort of think about so actually sometimes you'll find medieval Bishops writing against the practice of carolling this is a little funny to think about because I know that you know some traditions really love their like lessons in carols service on Christmas Eve which I think is awesome quite frankly and I'm not going to stop you know I'm not telling anybody stop doing that but it's quite funny to realize that there are lots of medieval Bishops you know in France and England and other places writing against the practice of caroling well why are they writing against the practice of Caroline because Caroline is um uh it's a it's a sort of a it's a carnival practice right you're going around from house to house and you're usually going with a keg or like a large bowl of very alcoholic punch and you come up to the door of the place and you sing and then you offer the people at the house you offer them a drink in exchange for like a gift gift of some kind right and this is this is caroling and um which by the way sounds like a great time uh we we tried to do caroling uh every year just around our neighborhood and um and uh but I've never like been like have a sit from the flask as well neighbor like maybe I need to bring that in but um that would definitely make you more popular if you yeah yeah yeah or less popular depending on which neighbor depending on which yeah but but anyway my point is that that that all of that sounds awesome okay but this actually helps explain the kind of the character of Christmas carols like if you go back and look at some really old medieval Christmas carols especially like medieval English carols which is what most of us know um sometimes they're uh they're let's put it this way they're not usually theologically explicit yeah um there A lot of times they'll have be be something like I Saw Three Ships on Christmas day or something like this and there's a lot of metaphor and it's the way to think of it is a sort of a a lyrical Veil over the mystery yeah and why is the mystery veiled in this way well it's because it's because we're not in church right and we're going around town and we're slightly drunk at this point and also some of the things that they sang along with Christmas carols in the same setting were drinking songs yeah um how much trouble how much trouble am I allowed to get into much trouble as you okay so I'll just say that there is a um uh there's a collection like a 15th century manuscript that collects a bunch of Christmas carols including one of my favorite uh medieval carols which is called Adam Le I bounden we'll talk about that in a second um but it also has like songs about somebody's male member um um the lyrics of which are are quite hilarious actually and and the thing you have to understand is they're going from house to house and you're getting songs about like the fall and original sin and and baby Jesus is a manger and then also here's a here's a funny you know body humor dirty like yeah like yeah here's a dirty song right that that's that's how carols were used that's what caroling is um this is this is the uh those are the only two registers anybody has in the Middle Ages you're either like contemplating the mystery or it's body humor and those are the two like there's nothing in between when would they Carol like when what dat what days do you know well so the the the thing that the really try to enforce is caroling doesn't start till Christmas night after Yeah Christmas night and then um and then you you go you go around caroling after that and of course eventually uh what happens is that um the distinction between Advent and Christmas tide gets kind of lost and that's how we get the situation that we have today but that doesn't really happen until the 19th century yeah um and then of course this culminates eventually Carol's become a Nostalgia thing um at least the ones that aren't about you know humor uh yeah uh forget about those don't know them now they become they become the wedes you here at the mall and by the way there were carols I'll just say there were carols for other holidays too yeah okay um some very famous very famous like Ash Wednesday carols okay um uh uh Good Friday carols U even one uh Carol for the circumcision of the Lord that I that I managed to find so there there were like historically there were other carols as well but Christmas was like the main time you went caroling and it has to do with this it has to do with this you the winter of it all basically right you need a drink it's like yeah you need a drink cold and it's dark drink yeah yeah um so um we also get things like the Christmas boar um there's there's actually a famous Carol about this the boore is head at Christmas which is which I really love um the use of especially in Western Europe the use of everg greenery you know like Garland Holly um um Evergreens you know fur trees things like this they used have this to sort of like uh sparse up the inside side of the house right with like lights and Evergreen which is if there's any aesthetic which which is like identifiably Christmas it would be lots of lights and just Evergreen things everywhere right um and again when most of the world is dead except for these particular plants yeah right that it's very easy to see why why that would be done and and also winter berries like the idea of a winter Berry is really important with Christmas because it has that light or that seed that's being preserved and you can still identify it even though everything else is dead yeah now that's uh that's a beautiful way to say that and uh even things like mistletoe which we we know like as modern people we know it to be a parasitic fungi right uh but fungus but but for medieval people the mistletoe had all these other connotations right you know the the um but also like it's a little poisonous so it's yeah but uh it's it's it's one of those interesting things go look at the way that mistleto is used in medieval symbolism that's a that's the whole video I think but really um uh so you have uh you have all this stuff that comes in uh another very important element that should not be overlooked is the feasting of the poor so this is a really important part of actually any Christian celebration um if you if you want to be tra and you want to go celebrate holidays in traditional ways if you're not buying a meal for somebody else right or or you know get a case of beer for the guy in the corner or something you know like if you're not if you are not actually feasting the poor in some way then you aren't actually tradition celebrating traditionally and so the way that it worked in for instance in medieval England is that there were certain days of the year uh Easter St John's night which is the summer solstice and then and Christmas uh specifically other days as well but those three days specifically when it was expected that the welltoo members of The Village or of the town would put out a feast for all of the poor people right and it's sort of like come and get as much as you want of all the richest Foods right and this is a really important part of the celebration as well um and a lot of times when we talk we think about like the social inversion aspect of some of these holidays like like the boy Bishop feast or the the Feast of the ass on January the 14th right obviously the there's there they have a connotation of like misrule and things like this and those aspects were always always a concern for for religious leaders especially those of the more sort of uptight variety um but also an a part of the the whole idea of inversion is that poor people get to eat what the rich people have and that's actually a really important Dynamic within Christianity and a really important Dynamic within the traditional observance of these feasts yeah and that's still like today we still have you know the kind of Christmas uh I don't know how you say it in English but you know like to gather around food for Christmas like you go to you for for poor people and make boxes for families that struggle and stuff like that's definitely still even in a secular world it's a there I I think every church that I've ever gone to as a member uh both as a Protestant now as an Orthodox Christian has done that for Christmas and um even the grocery stores get in on it you know it was like here's a bunch of conveniently packed bags of food you can just buy one and we'll donate it to the shelter and and things like that so um you know uh the rule about charity there are two rules about charity uh no since nobody asked there are two rules about charity one is that the the the less uh the closer the proximity the better right um the more times my money changes hands I'm not even talking about like where's that money actually going because this doesn't actually seem to be a question that we're supposed to ask as Christians I mean be a little Discerning about the Charities you donate to but Christ you know Christ says to give to every man that asks of you right so not but what is he going to do with it later um but but anyway the more times that that gift changes hands right basically the farther away I have to be from my neighbor to give to him right the let's say like the less salvific it is right it has a different effect on your soul if you are personally you know giving something to somebody you're looking somebody in the eye you're seeing them as a human being right it's that's a very different thing than I just I just gave some money to a to a charity online and now I'm covered and I'm not saying don't give money to Charities online like do what you can't do what do what you can do but but but maybe don't um don't underestimate the importance of um and this is just the real difference you could say like between religious charity and uh something like government welfare right um is that there is a sort of a a depersonalization that goes on right that makes it um you know never mind what the effect might be on the person who's on the receiving end right but for the person um you know um St John christum lots of lots of famous homilies against you know wealth uh there there are no warnings to the poor in the Bible you know and um but one of the things that he he you know to paraphrase you know said you know what are you saving up for hell you know kind of you know that kind of an idea but um yeah but he talks a lot about this and and says you know the poor man is there for your salvation right you know so you can't neglect him right so this is a really important part of of the celebration of this kind of feast and uh it's also a very important part of understanding the symbolism of Christmas right the highest thing becoming the lowest thing right that inversion uh which is which is at the heart of charitable giving Works of Mercy but is also at the heart of the the parts of the feast that make certain people itchy right the the the the inversion the like the social inversions and the and the the the rry and things like this that all of that is actually part of that that symbolism of the highest thing becoming low so um uh and then of course you know this inversion can take darker aspects right drunkenness gambling Etc um that's always been a problem PE and and and you know like uh people in charge have always tried to sort of figure complained about it Christmas yeah for sure right always got to figure out how to manage it right and I just want to reiterate a lot of the things that we're talking about here you know you can go back and look at like saturnalia as this time of inversion or or something like that um a lot of things we're talking about here can just right I think should be rightly understood as Integrations of pagan sols to celebrations and should be fine right if we understand the way that Christianity works the way that Christ works the significance of his coming into the world in the Deep of winter this should not actually present us with the difficulty yeah I mean I mean think about it like it's weird because also think about in the Middle Ages the bishop complaining that you know people in the town got too drunk instead of mentioning how they were massive orgies you know like right yeah like the Saturn Everything's Relative that's right Everything's Relative so you can actually see how how Christianity transforms these types of Feasts to like to be able to give some room for a bit of messiness to like point it but then point it towards towards a better path you could say yeah um uh I'm gonna talk a lot about Charles Taylor in a second his a secular age but he talks about these times of Carnival as being like um the idea of like if you have wine and a wine like wine aging in a wine skin and you don't like unstop it every once in a while eventually it's going to explode right the gas is just going to build up and it's going to explode um it's the same kind of a thing here like you do have to have a little bit like like you shouldn't get drunk but then also there are times when people need to get drunk right those are like the two weird uh that's the weird dichotomy that you find even in scripture even in scripture you find this right you know that there are in Leviticus right you know there's a whole like and if you can't go to the Jerusalem for this particular Feast then take the money that you would have spent on the trip and uh throw a big party for your friends and eat and be married and get drunk before the Lord right you know and so so it's it's it's a weird it's a weird kind of a thing and I think I think that the the balance the church has traditionally struck is that you always have uh you always have people saying knock it off you guys and you always have people sort of doing it anyway and that seems to like that seems to like hit like a good kind of flexibility and this is really actually with this point is such a great point that you're making and it's one that that uh it's that people don't understand traditional societies work because we tend to or understand Authority as always as absolute Authority that has absolute reach and so when we know that like you can't cross a red light we know that if you cross a red light then you'll get a ticket you know they'll they'll take a picture of your license plate and then you'll get a ticket by the mail or whatever and so but in a in a traditional world like you said it's actually a it's actually a dance right there's a dance like you said between different faction that create this kind of balance that move that doesn't always remain the same it kind of moves sometimes maybe it'll be moments where it's a bit more puritanical sometimes we will be a little more permissive and then it'll kind of slide back and forth between that but that's the dance between exactly that that the balance is saying yeah knock it off but then doing it to some extent anyways yeah the the kind of people you always want to be careful of are the either like the Puritans or like the total hedonists right that's right either one of those extremes is a really dangerous person it's a dangerous person to have in charge of your church it's a dangerous person to have in your life it's a dangerous kind of a person to be that's right um so this is the danger of going and and like just reading a whole bunch of canon law and then looking around at the people in your Parish or your priest nobody's doing what's there what a bunch of terrible Hypocrites none of them are doing what's there because that's not it's not really how that works right and uh but the thing that I wanted to point out is that the the the the when you talk about hierarchy right the bishop that the church has canonized that we set up as being this is the kind of person that you should be because they're like Christ so you should be like them if you go and look at the lives of of the Bishops the churches canonized one of the things that's basically Universal among them is their care for the poor right that they were out setting out a feast um out of their personal treasury not just for uh the poor on certain feast days of the year but every single day right so they're the people who who best embody the the highest thing you know in this case the bishop right the highest thing becoming the lowest right um and their ability to kind of do that and um and so it's it's this sort of it's this sort of interesting I mean the other big secret that that is kind of offensive to Modern Christianity is that uh I said I said a minute ago like there are no wordings to the poor in in the scriptures yeah and and if you look at the way that this has been that this has been uh the the rigidity and the flexibility that we're just talking about the way that's been enforced is it's the idea that the poor man is the man who needs the party and maybe he needs to get a little drunk right and then but it's actually it's you know it's the it's the well-to-do person you know feasting with all his friends he's the person who needs to be uh uh who needs to be sober and celebrate more soberly right and one of the weird things that happens in um this is this is what Taylor calls like multile multiple speed Christianity right um and one of the weird things that happens especially with puritanism is this idea that no there's actually only one speed and we have to hold the poor person to the same standard that we hold the rich man um and that sounds really egalitarian now but it's um not actually that's not actually how traditional societies work so okay so um kind of one of the things that I want to point out that is maybe a little different in the medieval celebration of Christmas both in the East and the West um is the Focus um uh especially on Christmas Eve in specific the focus on Christmas Eve uh uh on the the retelling of the story of Adam and Eve so if you go to church on Christmas Eve uh in the Orthodox Church uh you'll hear the the reading of the opening Narrative of Genesis the creation of the world and the fall of Man right that's the V that's that's the that's the Old Testament readings for Christmas Eve um if uh and this is where sort of uh there there is some kind of different Origins and really they're probably all true to a certain extent but one of the main origins of the Christmas tree comes from the paradise tree which would be set up on Christmas Eve which is actually the day you're supposed to put up your Christmas tree um not the day after American Thanksgiving everybody um um we sort of compromise and usually do it on St Nicholas Day but um in my family but uh which is in a couple of days uh from when we're recording this but um but anyway but but Christmas Eve traditional day when the tree goes up and uh and and because the idea is it's the tree of paradise it's the Tree of Life the tree of paradise and it was part there's a paradise Tree tradition both in east and west you said on well the paradise tree not so much but I I what I'm saying is the focus that that's really a Western European thing but the I'm just saying the focus on um the focus on Adam and Eve on Christmas Eve is a is the thing in both the East and the west and it's something that it's weird we kept the paradise tree right U and actually became totally ubiquitous in the western celebration of Christmas and in the East too everyone does Christmas trees now this is great I'm super pro Christmas tree so like go cut down a fur tree put it in your living room um great God will be pleased like do it but but um but uh but it's it's interesting because the the lurgical focus as far as I know and I could be wrong about this but the lurgical focus in the West on on Genesis um on Christmas Eve has kind of been lost but it was really cool in the middle a they would have um uh passion plays about Adam and Eve and this is the main this is the main let me put it this way this is the main time of fear when somebody in like medieval England would have interacted with the Genesis story not just like not just like seen a picture of it or like heard it read or something like that but the main time of year that they would have actually interacted with it in an embodied way would have been on Christmas Eve so they would have they would have like play yeah a and a passion play for people don't know is like a paraliturgical thing it's not something happens in the church but it's it's it's the origin by the way of like the like the Easter pageant or the Christmas Pageant that maybe you did I did lots of these growing up as uh you know as an Evangelical yeah and they were really cool memories um um but but that has its basis in the Passion Play but the Passion Play was something that it's not something that they did in the church it's something that they did in like the Village Square yeah um and they had they had them for obviously the name Passion Play uh uh uh you know implies passion TI but they had them for but they had them for all the various feces of the year in fact the passion plays for the for candle Groundhog Day we we talked about that last year um were really really cool um they had you know like a woman from the village that they selected to play the Virgin Mary and she would be carrying a baby and the whole city would Village would possess with her up to the door of the church and she'd present the baby to the priest and all this stuff like it was you know and so again these are sort of like paraliturgical ways to uh participate in the peast um okay so um and then also just one thing to mention is that because Christmas is a day to go to church first and foremost is all these other things but the thing that makes it a holy day is the fact that you're having the mass that's the mass in in Christ Mass right um U so it was considered to be a very important day there were a lot of famous Kings uh and Emperors including Charlamagne who were ordained on Christmas day yeah right it was just considered to be like the most appropriate day for this this kind of action I said ordan uh uh uh you see coronation ordination right but but coronation is that is a a holy order that's a sacrament of the church so um all right so let me talk a little bit real quick about Christmas in the early modern period so what's really interesting is that the Reformation period gives birth to both Christmas as we basically as we celebrate it now in the Western Hemisphere but also to the general anti-christmas movement right so like both of those things come out of the Reformation so on the one hand you have for instance Lutheranism Martin Luther big fan of Christmas um and uh which I take as a redeeming quality um and he he sort of engineered the massive production of Christmas hymns and carols and you can always tell a Lutheran Carol from a medieval Christian a medieval English Carol because the medi medieval English carols are like really weird and have like a lot of of symbolism and things like this and the Lutheran carols because they written as theologically explicit songs are are like very like obviously theologically explicit and so it's um whereas whereas like the the older medieval carols are kind of more riddling in nature um but this is when Christmas trees really become a big thing um probably related to that paradise tree like we talked about um and and also just the general very ancient practice in that part of the world of bringing Greenery into the house as part of the winter celebration are there are there any of the medieval hymns that are still active now yes um there are I I've actually kind of put together a playlist of some of them um of course all the ones that we uh so are you asking about him or carols because again that's a Carol like christas Carol yeah um yes there are a few um probably the oldest one that people know well is good King Wes loss right uh which is about the uh which is about the practice by the way feeding the poor at Christmas right right um and one of my favorite songs actually but there's which is weird because it's not like yeah it's like it doesn't talk about Christmas right directly in the way that like holy night does let's say yes yeah well it's on the Feast of Steven which people used to know is the second day of Christmas but um yeah yeah people used to know that uh better but uh but it's a very old Carol um uh I met as as far as other ones that are like still in popular vernacular um uh um I have a bunch of ones that I like a whole lot that are not necessarily wellknown anymore um let me think about this maybe I'll try to post some on the Facebook group um I put together a kind of like a pre-modern Advent playlist and just try to find like all the carols and hymns that I could find that had been written before a certain date and I I've got about 30 or 40 things on that list and so maybe I'll maybe I'll share that with with everybody again but um um some of them are like well known some of them are you know obviously all the all the Orthodox hyms for the feast are all you know written in like the 8th Century so you know that's all squarely premodern but um but those aren't carols right um okay so Lutheranism produces just a massive amount number of Christmas hymns and carols um Christmas trees really become a big thing um actually uh Luther was big on Christmas trees not so much on the crash right the nativity scene um and uh so what really funny is eventually this is the thing about Christmas uh the stickiness that we've been talking about um people don't get rid of Christmas traditions they just add new ones and so so some people were like no you should do a tree not a cre and so everybody's like great we'll do both in fact we'll do a CR under the Christmas tree see how see how you like that you know yeah um makes so much sense symbolically to have right right it does hierarchy of heaven and and angels of Lights you know and then at the bottom you have the crish and you put an angel or a star at the top are the same thing which is the same thing yeah I I I love this is why I love Christmas so much and I think it was like my one of my primary uh early like symbolic um my early symbolic education really was just paying attention to Christmas uh customs and things like I was talking about earlier because everything about Christmas is so deeply symbolically intuitive um it's just really beautiful um so and a lot of the trappings that we think of as kind of defining the American Christmas now were basically brought to North America by the moravians uh uh by the Pennsylvania Dutch and by these these other groups and so there were several Continental reformed churches such as the Dutch reformed which did continue to celebrate Christmas um uh they celebrated as one of the five Evangelical feasts um which were Christmas Good Friday Easter Ascension and Pentecost and I I I have never understood maybe somebody out there wants to enlighten me uh Pastor Paul or somebody else uh why those are the Evangelical feasts and not any of the other things in the gospels that are also Christian feasts like uh you know the the name Evangelical usually when we say something is evangelical in historical sense we mean it's mentioned in the gospels right but so is Transfiguration anunciation Etc so I don't know why are the five feasts uh well the five Evangelical Feast at least back then for the Dutch reformed uh where I'm not saying of anything about curent practice but where Christmas Good Friday Easter Ascension and Pentecost I think it's because Easter Ascension and Pentecost right that's all kind of one cluster there a coherence you know how many days you can get it from scripture pretty much yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that might be what it is I think it is because the other dates you you can't get from scripture when to to celebrate the other ones and and this is basically where we get the uh the general idea um in American Christianity um and here I'm going to speak very broadly of kind of like the the Christmas and Easter Rhythm if if you know what I'm talking about like this idea by which you have Christmas and that's a big deal and you have Easter which is usually a really big deal and then but there's really nothing else of particular spiritual significance between the Tu other than of course your you're just your Sunday observance your Lord's Day observance right that's and which is how I grew up right um where we really get into trouble though Christmas wise is when we get into the Puritans right and so here I have to say some things um that uh well they're I'm I'm just going to read what they said like it's not fun uh these were not fun people I don't know howse to say it um ptin were not fun people not fun people quote me on that but I think they would have said they were not fun people so I think it's okay um so the the the puritanical movement and by by this I mean English Puritans being a sect of of English Christians who um uh thought that the Church of England the Reformation had not gone far enough in rejecting what they call popery or papism right and so so they were really trying to like purify so you had your Puritans who were like trying to purify the Church of England and the separatists who were like we're out of here right but they really kind of the same movement yeah um and then and then of course uh uh my own ancestors on one side of my family the Scottish Calvinists um and who also did not like Christmas oh really yeah well some of them so so uh John Knox famously said uh uh uh uh supported the Banning of Christmas on the grounds that it was superstitious um various Puritan writers refer to Christmas as being the trappings of poery the rags of the Beast and so on the rags Rags of the Beast yeah so so this is this is actually a really important thing to think about I think because sometimes when people talk about this they'll say something like well the Puritans didn't ban Christmas actually they did for a very short period of time um from the uh for about 13 years it was actually illegal to celebrate Christmas like straight up illegal to celebrate Christmas in England um Talk about that in a second but they'll say something like well they were they were rejecting it this is what people will say they'll say they were rejecting it because of the over celebration and the tendency for people to over celebrate so the thing that I kind of want to point out here is two things one is is there's always been people you know ining against don't over celebrate but it but but it had never been necessary to ban the holiday outright right the other thing though is to point out that the the act of celebration for the p the act of Celebration itself was associated with Superstition and specifically Roman Catholicism yeah right and this even has weird manifestations um uh one of my areas of of study that I did like a whole project on uh in my graduate degree was actually um the American prohibition movement uh and the temperance movement which I'm just really interested in for a lot of reasons but one of the interesting things that you'll fine if you go back and you read a lot of the early Temperance literature um and I have I've actually gone to the the country's largest Temperance archives um to like read through a bunch of the early literature um what you what you'll find is that is that there is a lot of of frankly anti-catholic sentiment as a part of the literature of the early temperance movement because it's the it's the German Italian Irish immigrants coming over here they drink who drink and that's causing the problem actually it was actually probably the saloons that were causing the problem not the beer but that's a different conversation we can talk sometime about the symbolism of going from we all get together as a family to have some beer and we're sitting at a table looking at each other to I'm sitting at a bar facing a bartender there's a important important shift that happens there as part of the Industrial Revolution but anyway different conversation for a different day um but the thing I want to I want to really emphasize though is that all of the stuff like the celebration the drunkenness but then also like the mass and the Liturgy right the high things and the low things about the feast day for the Puritan that was all a package and it had to all be rejected um and so this leads to the outright Banning um starting in 1645 and then again in 1647 um there they passed an ordinance in England abolishing the Feast of Christmas Easter and witson or Pentecost e too really abolishing Easter as well like which uh which people always forget about that wow always forget about that and that that remains in force until the Restoration in 1660 um in fact there was a really fun kind of a popular song I Wish I remember to to put the lyrics in my notes for this talk but um there was like a kind of a fun popular song uh celebrating because now we know you know that Charles has you Charles has come back Charles II because now we know when Christmas is yeah yeah and so there been because there've been like a lot of underground celebrations and things like that going you imagine like think about it today if we said I mean they did it during Co some right right right they're like you can't celebrate Christmas this year and it's was like yeah what yeah yeah so um uh so yeah this is like this this was all a package deal the Puritans believe that by puring the Liturgy and the iconography of the papal religion they would also be able to usher in an era of moral Improvement right and that's the kind of the thing that's a a continuous theme of of people who want to get rid of Christmas is that by doing so we'll make we'll become morally better as a Society MH right that it's that Christmas is is associated with excess or It's associated with corruption like decadence of some sort um which is funny because like it's just interesting because that's the danger of the feast you know it's like right you think people don't get drunk at weddings right do you think people don't get drunk at funerals do you think people don't you know it's like when you gather together to celebrate something it has uh there's a kind of ecstasy there there's something going on which is both very positive but also dangerous and so you kind of have to navigate that line so that it doesn't fall into and it also is a revealer it reveals it you know the feast can reveal the nature of a group yeah you and reveal its quality you know because if it gets out of hand then it it also is showing something about the nature of that communion yes that is that is a really important note um uh the other the other thing is that when you when you try really hard to repress this yeah right that that it will pop up again but it'll pop up in some really dangerously excessive way that's right right um in the same way that you know uh the if you you can have Christian liturgy or you can have the occult like pick like you know like but but there's a lurgical impulse in human beings that they that you know everybody has to participate in something so this is also like there's so many things about this like social dancing for example oh great example of that where it's like it's like can you be at a at a feast where you dance with someone else's wife can you is that possible and then what can can you maintain the order and the right the right ordering in that kind of that place that could Reveal Your your Darkness let's say yeah yeah um can I tell you a joke yeah go for it this is a joke that we b as a Baptist growing up we told about ourselves so it's um it's not intended to be cruel so it goes like how Baptist am I uh How Baptist are you um I'm so Baptist that we don't play Old Maid in the front of the house because if somebody drives through by at 50 miles hour looks through the window sees us playing cards they'll assume we playing poker if we're playing poker we're gambling if you're gambling you're fornicating and we all know that fornication leads to premarital dancing that's yeah anyway just yeah this a joke that we kind of told about ourselves but uh but I think there's really something to that social dancing is which is something I was not allowed to do growing up um and then I married a wife my my wife who who loves dancing and uh so we you know so she sort of like introduced me to it and it was just like um man it was it was a weird moment the first time that I danced to music it was bizarre and the reason it was bizarre I discovered two things one is I really like in uh but the other is that I suddenly realized what music was for like I I I grew up I was a violinist and I did a lot of like Irish fiddle music like Jigs and re which are just dances dancing but I never danced in my life and so my wife and I we to do like um we got really into folk dance at a period and we did a bunch of Scottish country dance and uh the first time I like danced to a a a real but I was actually doing the real suddenly everything about the music clicked in the place for me M and it was just this very bizarre moment of realizing that that like there was a whole half of me that was dead and then it just came to life and it was it was just very it was very strange um so yeah um and all this to say uh uh uh there was this period you know a relatively short period but a pretty Infamous period and really scarred English society for a long time uh where it was actually against the law to celebrate Christmas um and of course the real irony in all of this is that the direct descendants of Puritans will now fight vociferously to have a nativity scene in a public space that's right right to uh to to fight for the use of Merry Christmas instead of just happy holidays and so on um and uh and I and and it's because there's this stickiness about Christmas like you can do whatever you want to but Christmas will win eventually it will win um um and plenty of other people have tried to get rid of it since the time of the Puritans we could talk about I'll talk about some the moment but of course there's like a modern manifestation of puritanism that is sort of like the political correct the PC woke culture right uh that that that tries really hard to get rid of Christmas or to change Christmas or to like reimagine it in some way I mean think about any modern TV show it's been a thing in American network television for decades that you have to have a Christmas episode yeah right and so one of the things that you'll see in more recent TV shows is that whenever the Christmas episode comes around they have to do more and more to kind of like recontextualize What Christmas Means but they can't get away from doing the episode right um and Christmas man Christmas Aesthetics they are powerful you cannot get rid of that like just it's weird because even like even the the even the all the efforts of all the marketing companies to reduce it and to remove the Christian part of it and to stylize it and to do that is just feeding it like you cannot get rid of of the chrisan sh the the Christmas like visuals the smell the the music it just you there's no way now like imagine trying to to get rid of that yeah just impossible yeah uh so actually you mentioned the smell I wanted to make sure I didn't forget to mention this so uh because New England New England specifically other parts of the US were founded were settled by different people many of whom were like had no trouble with Christmas at all U but but New England was settled by Puritans and separatists right and one of the really interesting things there is that uh um at some point in the history of New England it was before the American Revolution um uh they the there the towns in New England would actually hire mince sniffers they were called mince sniffers so the job of a mint sniffer is to walk through the village or walk through the town on Christmas Day and sniff the air and make sure nobody's cooking Christmas Foods on Christmas day man um and you could be like really severely punished really severely punished for celebrating Christmas you know um at that particular time so um and and at that time like the whole idea of Christmas celebration again like that's something the German immigrants at the End of the Street might be doing but good Puritan families weren't participating in that um so uh to kind of get up up to modern times the early 19th century is really a Renaissance for Christmas celebrations in the anglosphere and this is for two reasons one is the Oxford movement which is basically this uh it was like a movement within the church Church of England to uh kind of return to like a more patristic uh uh basis for the tradition um it's kind of when Anglo Catholicism as such sort of uh uh develops into full flower right um and kind of right along the same time you had uh a guy named Charles Dickens and I know they made a movie about him Rec a couple years ago or something called the man who invented Christmas which I actually did not see because I hate seeing movies about historical figures that I I I like or I know a lot about because I'll just get angry especially now it's like now right maybe 20 years ago yeah yeah yeah I just don't I didn't know what they're going to do but so I don't know if the movie was any good or not but it's it's like you know there's something about the title there the man who invented Christmas which is like a little cheeky uh but also also it's not totally wrong right um uh like I said Christmas had been pretty had taken a pretty big hit in the 17th century and it was being celebrated in England again but also it was it was still like there was just a lot of every year like kind of like uh hand ringing around the celebration of Christmas and Etc so but this really between the Oxford movement and they're trying to go back and basically Rive revive the medieval practices of these feasts and then Charles Dickens coming along and and writing A Christmas Carol um uh did a ton to revive traditional celebration of the holiday focused especially on the ancient theme of charitable works at this time which again is a very important part of traditionally celebrating Christmas and to this day I mean you say what you want to say about Americans but to this day it remains this time of year that that we are the most likely to give to charity even people who don't think about or give anything to the poor the rest of the year on Christmas there's suddenly this like generosity that our hearts will open up uh you know a little bit more than they were open before yeah it's interesting that Dickens I it's funny because now i' never thought about that but I think I thought about now that it's called The Christmas Carol and it's a secular T you know it's not directly Christian it it kind of floats around the themes like what you described about the Christmas carols that's exactly why it's called A Christmas Carol and um uh it's it's it's so interesting because there are of course references to people going to church references to Christ references to like the theme of the day the the the little babe and the manger who makes the lame walk and you know Etc right that's all in there but you're right it's a it's not a lurgical story it's not just a retelling of the the the Nativity narratives from the gospels or something like that it's this sort of thing that's happening around the church right in the around the church and specifically throughout the life of one man um and uh it kind of creates this really uh uh I think I I think what is so genius about the Christmas carol I mean we should do a whole video just on it um is that it uh uh it we're going to talk in a moment about the these idea of like sort of knots in time right which is really what a feast day is and the Christmas carol takes that idea and runs with it because it ties Scrooge's entire life together over the course of one Christmas to the next that's right right which which becomes like a really powerful way of thinking about our own lives right you know where were we on this feast day what person were we on this feast day you know um so in the United States uh like I said Christmas was really seen more as more of an ethnic holiday which meant that you actually had whole communities that just didn't celebrate Christmas which is kind of Unthinkable now um until about the the late 19th century and it really starts to be celebrated in the late 19th century thanks to the works of poets like the guy whose name I'm forgetting right now who wrote uh uh the what was originally called a visit from St Nicholas uh it was the night before Christmas you know that poem and then uh which which which really basically kicks off the whole idea of gift giving at Christmas in the United States yeah and joins the the Feast of saying Nicholas with Christmas because I was wondered like when did that happen at some point for us it's crushed together in the West St Nicholas and Christmas is the same and then you you like I had a Romanian priest in our parish for a few years and he was really annoyed that we gave gifts at Christmas and was like really trying to like make sure that we give our gifts you know on St Nicholas Day which oh that's so fun he didn't succeed though like nice try it's too now it's too deep like in our yeah yeah you can't you can't undo it um uh and then there was also um uh Harry beer sto who wrote Uncle Tom's Cabin which is I guess a little Infamous now but anyway um she also wrote a a story I think it's called a Christmas in New England which did a lot to kind of popularize the celebration of Christmas and like the whole focus of a Christmas in New England right is on the sort of like immigrant Community within New England that's celebrating the holiday and that other people kind of get involved and participate in it and so um yeah so uh the 18 late 19th century is really when Christmas takes off in the United States and this culminates in its declaration as a Federal holiday in 1870 um and it's important to note that for Americans that wasn't even a holiday great Christmas wasn't even a holiday up to the time and it's totally Unthinkable now but like George Washington didn't celebrate Christmas worked on Christmas yeah like like he didn't just work on Christmas he fought B he attacked the hessin who were Germans on Christmas because they were celebrating and it was like that's like his famous like crossing the Delaware attacks the Hess one of the most important victories of the American reevolution tionary War worked because the Americans weren't celebrating on Christmas Day and the and the the Hess were right so it's like these various like very interesting kind of history there in our early uh status as a early time as as a nation and then Christmas kind of developing more and more first is this immigrant thing and then now it's totally Universal um and so there's a lot more that we could probably say about the symbolism of the holiday um I kind of run out of time here to talk about the use of like Santa Claus as a marketing image yeah where Coca-Cola specifically and also I think it's important I think because this is an argument that people use a lot is that in some ways you know Santa Claus today was made up by Coca-Cola and right I really I resist that to some extent yeah I agree I agree you know I think that the the character of Father Christmas and St Nicholas were there in the 19th century you see the characters and then they kind of get fused into one one one character which is our modern Santa Claus but and then and then the marketing companies kind of jump on that and you know Coca-Cola did simplify the costume let's say in terms of the White Band and stuff right and made it and made it let's be honest like a little more palatable to some people right like well less less of a bishop for right exactly some guy with a crer and a bishop smer like that's not gonna that's not gonna play in P in like post yeah exactly like post Pur Puritan America yeah um but but nonetheless like they stumble onto all this is why when you talk about how Christmas is so sticky it's like yeah you know people I did a video on Rudolph the rednose reindeer which is basically was made up by uh like a what was it one of the big department stores in the United States and it was given out at Christmas as a gift to people buying at the dartan store to get people into the store but they stumbled onto true things you know there's something about how symbolism happens and I think in the symbolism of Santa Claus and the way that we think about the sleigh and everything all of these these are very powerful images that that uh that even though marketing companies came up with them or brought them up it doesn't really matter if we recognize in them some images that have weight and the fact that they're remembered means that there's there's some actual weight in those images yeah I'm a huge sucker for Santa Claus movies in general um uh uh Miracle on 34th Street is a really they two remakes two they made it twice and both both versions are quite good I think there was an animated film about Santa Claus Like Us Santa Claus is like a family Dynasty that came out a few years later called a few years ago rather called Arthur Christmas and um it's a it's a really interesting movie it is uh it does a lot of sort of interesting things like tries to subvert the Santa Claus symbolism at the outset and then shows all the problems that that causes and then by the end things have to kind of revert back to the traditional pattern and I haven't seen it I should watch that yeah it's interesting it's I would love to know your thoughts on it it's it's it's an interesting one but um but yeah I I think that it's one of these weird things because actually the Soviet Union of course tried to also abolish Christmas and when they did they just replaced it with a winter holiday and they had a they had old man winter you know who looks who's dressed exactly like Santa Claus right and he's the one that brings you to the presence now you know right you know and uh it's there's something about this right uh all of the attempts actually to revive or or create competing uh Winter holidays in the secular world around us today going back to the French Revolution favorite one is the do you guys um do you have like the three kings cake is that's something that you do yeah we do that here yeah yeah so that's that's not that's that's a French thing it's it's not something that I grew up with but it's a French thing uh in so you'll you'll you'll get a kick out of knowing that during the French Revolution they renamed the three kings cake to the equality cake uh which is which is amazing because the original story about the three kings is that you have like the highest thing becomes low and then the high thing comes down and venerates the thing that's become low that was you know like and then it's like no know equality cake it's all perfectly it's all perfectly even no and they don't put they don't put the seed I me they don't put the seed in there they don't I assume not because it's like hey someone get someone special if he finds the thing can't have that you get the guillotine that's what you get if you find the SE yeah anyway like in Quebec we like in French in in in Quebec we yeah Santa Claus we called him Father Christmas yeah like that's how so and that's a that's a papa Noel or something Papa Noel yeah per Noel and that's like a that there's this whole character that appeared in Western Europe and in France that had the had the hat and was very similar to the way that we understand uh uh Santa Claus now so it's like all these characters get fused yeah it seems like it's a thing that that has to happen you know yeah um there's a lot more we could say about this but there are a few things that I want to point out that are like really beautiful to me about all of this uh that we kind of been talking about and then I'm going to give you what I call my midwit defense of Christmas all right so uh the first thing is just to say that uh kind of against the general detractors of Christmas right that that Christmas is actually not our most overc commercialized time of the year um we're always overc commercialized Christmas is the only time of year that we notice it right because you know if you think about like all the kitch and like the the the $1 you know like the bargain bins and stuff at Target or Walmart or whatever like those are there all year you know but only at Christmas do you notice it and get irritated about it yeah um I think it is a a really beautiful time where the sort of the let's say the soft iconic clasm of American religion gives way to not just like putting up nativity scenes with statues of Jesus Joseph and Mary like in your house in your yard in the Village Square right but actually defending that practice in the court of public opinion which is really something to think about yeah um and uh it's also the time of year like I mentioned but by the Numbers we're the most generous right it's the one day a year that even confirm ired heathens will show up to church so I was a pastor and from a family of pastors and I get that there's always something in you that wants to complain when somebody shows up on Christmas Day or on Easter or PCA and you haven't seen them in a year yeah you know it's like oh so now you're here right but but like you could also flip that around though and think about the fact that there's something so potent about this day that even the most confirmed Heathen will still show up to light a candle right they'll still show up to a midnight like they'll still come to church with their kids like they take their kids to church by one day a year there's something really special something really potent about about this day so I want to kind of explain that I'll give you what I call my my midwit apology or or defense of Christmas and I call it a midwit um uh some people know I'm a big fan of like the the format of a midwit meme right and so you know the the I'm sure we can put one up here on the screen or something but you know the idea is is you have like a really dumb person at one end and a really smart person at the other end and there's bell curve in the middle and the bell curve in the middle that guy's the midwit um so in this case the meme is the really the really simple person who says celebrate Christmas because it's Jesus birthday right and then at the other end you have the saint who says the same thing celebrate Christmas because it's jesus' birthday and for a lot of people and uh I'll I'll go as far as to say probably the majority of the people watching this video that is enough that is enough but for all the people kind of like in the middle there the source yes the sources people yes we need like a little more kind of an explanation or understanding of why we're doing the things that we're doing and and again as I said to me this is a really important this really important thing so um I'm going to read some little bits and and kind of talk through some bits from Charles Taylor's work a secular age which is one of the most important books that I think anybody could read right now um and what's amazing is that a lot of the ideas that I have really benefit benefited from here on the symbolic World listening to your videos and conversations over the last several years I first encountered in Taylor and then when I saw your videos I was like oh somebody else is talking about that same thing right and it was just really I don't know validating a certain way so uh he talks about basically this idea that there are three kinds of time for medieval man there are three kinds of time and the the first one is the uh uh in in one of our previous videos I referred to this as the difference between Kronos and chyros as two kinds of time but Taylor says there's three right so there's first of all there's there's Kronos which we could refer to as was what what Taylor calls homogeneous or empty time right which for modernity is the central form of time yeah right history as a series of accidents right in the philosophical sense like history has a series of accidents cause and effect and just sort of this cause and effect in an endless chain with no particular meaning to it right and then um the second kind of time is um uh he says he uh the second kind of time is is what we could call chotic time and so uh kairotic time would be time fil being filled with meaning so Taylor says that the time of Carnival for instance is kairotic uh that is the timeline encounters kairotic knots uh so you have this the straight line and then suddenly you hit kind of like a knot where everything gets kind of snarled up and bended together and um moments whose nature and placing calls for reversal followed by others demanding rededication and still others which approach parusia so this is his shro Tuesday lent Easter right so shro Tuesday that's Marty Gro right is this great moment of Carnival or reversal followed by lent for rededication and then Easter which is like parusia the coming the revealing so there are now there are kairotic knots in the stories we tell about ourselves in our time revolutions themselves are understood by their heirs and supporters as such kairotic moments you think about whatever country you live in and and the the important political moments or like revolutions that you've had uh in my case like the American Revolution comes this huge kind of kairotic moment where the actual details and timelines about George Washington and Benjamin Franklin and the founding fathers in July the 4th and all that stuff is less important than all of those things kind of being gathered together in that particular moment yeah um it says National hor historiography is full of such moments but what has changed is that around which these moments gather so in the pre- watered era um the organizing field for ordinary time comes from these higher times so the higher times are uh basically two sources um so if you think of ordinary time is like secular time uh I know that the word secular can mean various different things here but for now we'll just call it this sort of homogeneous chronological time um there are kind of two sources for that meaning um and one is uh what is eternity right eternity sort of breaking into ordinary time and then the other is what uh uh uh Taylor calls like the great time right uh at this is this is like say like mythical time this is like when all the important stuff happen to make the way the world that it is today right um so if you're you know living in like a pre uh like like a stone age civilization or something the great time is like when the gods were on Earth walking around among Mortals right you know um for the Christian Story the great time is really the gospel right the gospels when Christ was here on Earth right when he's establishing these things and there's this idea that um Taylor really develops um the way that you have the horizontal dimension of secular time but also these vertical Dimensions where uh where eternity and where or or and the and or the great time kind of break into that secular time and you could say like the more pronounced that happens the bigger the not becomes yeah and um this is what makes uh these relationships and it's really a three-way relationship between homogeneous time and uh and you know like our mythical history and then eternity Yeah the more relationships they are the bigger the not becomes and this is actually what gives time meaning and uh there's a famous line uh in Hamlet and I'm still waiting for all the symbolic world people to have like the big Hamlet moment so maybe it'll happen um um because Hamlet is a tremendously important one of Shakespeare's most important place it's a tremendously important work of literature because it it's one of the things that Hamlet is grappling with is the is the sort of the great uh disenchantment and the Passover from the ancient world into the modern right it's it's not for nothing that um that Hamlet has just come from you know University you know in Germany at the birthplace of the Reformation he's just come from University in Germany at the birthplace of modernity right he's coming back and he's trying to apply these modern understandings to this these encounters with the world that are just wild and insane his father is a ghost and his mother you know and and being cuckle that like all these things and Hamlet eventually goes insane like trying to kind of keep it all together um you know and you know get stabbed in a duel and everything else as well but but I mean the the kind of the point you know uh this is one of the big things the the the the play is wrestling with and um but there's this line in there where he says the times are out of joy the times are out of joint which has kind of become like a like a phrase but this is what it means it means that uh he's not just saying the condition of Danish Society at this particular time is lamentable that's not what he means he means that things aren't fitting together in the proper fashion anymore as they do in times which are closer to those ordering paradigms of Eternity and of the Sacred time um and uh and it's it's interesting this comes relatively soon after his he's having a discussion with marcelus and Marcela says you know that ghosts and goblins don't dare walk the earth on Christmas Eve you know on so hallowed and so gracious is the time by the way you know this is is Hamlet A Christmas Story well if Die Hard is a Christmas story Hamlet is definitely a Christmas story but anyway um so the thing with Christmas is that it's one of these moments and the other moment really is the the crucifixion uh which is something that that uh that Taylor also identifies that uh the crucifixion and and Christmas are these two moments where there's a complete like like the relationships that kind of keep all of these things related to each other are like the most complete right the symbolism matches up the most right you could say and uh because of that these moments become extremely sticky or the knots become like really really Tangled and and it becomes almost impossible becomes almost impossible to disentangle those things and so what people try to do is sort of cut the gordian KN and just like cut right through it and say no more Christmas right but but it but it Christmas has this tremendous regenerative quality to it um and I think it's because it's the moment when it's the moment when the Great Time and Eternity and chronological time I mean it's really important that Christ was born in Bethlehem we know more or less the day we know more or less the year but it's really important that that God enters history uh because the other option is that you have with the situation that the Greeks had which would be chronological time and then uh eternity like the world of ideas and but there's nothing there's nothing to kind of bridge the gap between them so what they end up coming up with is the idea of time is being sort of SE Eternal which is constantly constantly progressing like no basically time with no beginning or no end right uh like always change but never fulfillment right but in Christmas we get this we get this this fulfillment of all of these things and and all of the sort of the ver vertical and the horizontal dimensions of time come together in this warp yeah yeah which is appears in the story itself like we mention obviously we don't want to go through all the Christmas symbolism but yeah there it is the the tree with the with the with nativity set you know at the at the bottom the manger whether it is the angels singing down to the Shepherds you know there are they're just countless or it is these these wise men that come from afar like all of the symbolis of Christmas is about this intersection in the story itself not even accounting for what it is what it's actually doing for us at that moment and so this is my just to wrap this up this is my argument for why you have to celebrate Christmas right it's not just enough to believe that the the child born of a virgin was the logos from before the ages right we can say we believe that or we want to but if we don't act on that information some way and the way that you act on this information the the the uh Taylor refer talks about liturgy and like the the let's say he talks about the feast the act of Celebration as being like a song right so the song has a a Melody like a think of like a little Melody has sequential moments you know all these different notes and everything but but really the beginning to the end of that song all happen in the same moment because it's a unit right so if you don't sing the song then you're not actually you have no way of participating in it in that moment the moment just passes You by right and if you don't celebrate Christmas then the moment this holy moment right this moment when Heaven and Earth everything comes together into this point right that moment just passes You by and pretty soon you stop believing at all right you stop really thinking I mean uh there uh you know there's there are certain organizations that will do like polls to see like what's the state of belief you know and like year after year um if you look at this uh one of the questions on there is um is uh uh true or false Jesus Christ is the greatest being ever created by God right and so um and that's that's one of the questions on the survey and horrible question every well yeah it's it's definitely a leading question right but freaky question man yeah but what happens is that every year or every four years when they do the survey that number goes up by 10 or 15% yeah right where people are just sort of like sliding into aryanism right and um you know there's a lot that could be said about the state of catechesis and Theological education in churches in America day etc etc but really the thing that we need to do is not just put Christ back in Christmas but put the mass back in Christmas right to really keep the feast to keep the celebration and you can keep it at every single one of these Dimensions you can go to church and contemplate the mystery you can wake your neighbors up uh you know at 9:00 at night and seeing seeing them songs and offer them booze like you can do all of this stuff right you can participate in all of these dimensions and if you do you'll be more of a human being than you were but if you do you will also be able to draw closer to Christ and closer to your neighbor right and that actually without these things what ends up happening is that time just becomes does every does anybody remember covid right with all the celebrations taken away like like what happened time happened during Co exactly time just becomes this long kind of like like undifferentiated linear yeah you know passage and and nothing there and there's no memory right there's no memory there's no participation so that's the midwit explanation the easy one is it's Jesus birthday why wouldn't you celebrate it so all right Richard that's great thank you so much and uh don't forget Everybody by the way that Richard will be there at the symbolic World Summit so if you I have so many
