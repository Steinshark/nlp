did you hear the news I'm done code interpreter is 
the nail in the coffin for me the jobs are going   to be gone tomorrow going to Paradise okay why 
not educate yourself on it rather than running   away from it I'm sure we have all felt like 
that at some point uh other Tiff can I call you   okay I guess I'll stay around for a little bit 
but then I'm gone but the reality is there is so   much more to it than oh my gosh this is going to 
take over my job and we are going to get into what   exactly does this mean for software Developers 
for data analysts data scientists many different   roles within the tech industry later in this video 
but first let's actually get our hands in it let's   see what is this thing actually capable of and 
what is just the hype about also to make sure to   hit that subscribe button for more Tech coding and 
career related content all right let's get into it   foreign well first of all what are the current 
capabilities of code interpretive well to start   with it is only familiarized or it only is 
sufficient in Python uh it does not know or   familiarize itself with JavaScript yet or any 
other programming language but the keyword is   yet that is to come for now though with python 
what it is really good at doing is reading and   analyzing big data sets and we're going to get 
into that and I think the main thing it's kind   of it's funny because code interpreter you would 
think it would be used for web developers or   that's the tool that it would be mainly primarily 
focused on writing code building websites but in   turn it's actually really good at analyzing data 
of this moment or at this moment but in turn at   this current moment it actually focuses more on 
data if you upload a CSV file and then it can   turn this into these really detailed graphs uh 
explain to you what is going on make gifts for   you out of you know what let me show you all 
right to start with I have up on screen here   chat gbt and you can see under gpt4 I have code 
interpreter now I am a subscriber plus if you   are not you won't be able to see code interpreter 
or use it at this moment it will come though just   slowly being rolled out what I didn't realize 
at first is because this is better when you   initially if you're a paid subscriber when you 
initially go to chatgpt4 gpt4 code interpreter   will not be there what you need to do actually 
is go into your settings and ensure under beta   that code interpreter is toggled on that way then 
when you go to use it or use gpt4 you will see it   there all right so before we do anything else 
though we need to get a big data set so let's   go to kegel.com and find a data set that we can 
start analyzing we meaning code interpreter okay   so you can see on screen here I have kegel.com up 
and this is a great website whenever you want to   build data for this I went to data sets and you 
can see here there's trending Sports a ton of   different ones to choose from I actually am going 
to go back because I chose one I want to really   focus on which is sleep health and lifestyle data 
set and this is interesting because essentially it   is a data set that compromises a 400 rows and 13 
columns covering a wide range of variables related   to sleep and daily habits so gender age occupation 
so you can really get a good sense or the goal we   will be using this data for is to get a good sense 
of who has the best sleep what lifestyle factors   are with that best sleep and see hopefully if 
we can replicate it because sometimes I don't   get that good of a sleep that's why I drink so 
much coffee so to take this let's go download   and we do have to sign in or create an account 
so let's go ahead and do that I'll be right back   all right 20 years later we are back I hate that 
you have to create a password for everything and I   just downloaded the file the Sleep CSV so now back 
in Chachi PT let's make sure code interpreter is   toggled which it is interpreter interpreter code 
interpreter yeah okay now they've got that out of   the way let's upload our CSV file let's go into 
downloads and go to sleep data set we could just   press enter and see work its magic but let's just 
get a little bit more detailed let's go explain this data set to me in simple terms 
all right let's see how it does now while it's explaining and writing it's uh 
explanation for us something really interesting   that I like is you can click on show work and it 
will show how it got to its explanation which is   really interesting especially for individuals 
who are data nerds or really that's their world   to understand okay why okay there is males 
the ages occupations sleep duration and now   if we scroll down here it will say the data 
set appears to be a collection of personal   health and lifestyle data okay as expected and 
then it goes into what each column represents   so it breaks down from person gender age 
and then also too it does kind of a nice   summary in simple terms the data set seems to 
be examining the relationship between various   lifestyle factors all right let's get into it 
a little bit further now let's start actually   building graphs with it and seeing what it's 
capable of let's try seeing what some of the   trends are that's the goal of this for uh this 
sleep lifestyle what makes people have good sleep   so let's go can you share with me what are some 
of the trends in this data and I'm hoping it will   return for me a graph as well but if it doesn't 
we will prompt it to so let's see what it returns I don't think you can but if you listen ever 
so closely you might be able to hear Mr mug   snoring in the background for me I can hear it a 
lot but I think sits in the Next Room you might   not be able to 12 p.m on a Sunday just having 
a nap I was gonna say cat nap but he would not   like that dog nap all right based on the basic 
summary statistics of the data set here are some   initial trends all right you know what this is 
a lot of text let's let it finish and then we'll   ask it to put this into a graph for us and let's 
focus on in the graph you just have to do all and   see what happens okay it says this here actually 
for a more detailed analysis we could examine the   correlations between variables distribution 
of variables for example we could look how   sleep duration varies with physical activity 
let's do that plot for me how create a graph   for me with the uh with a detailed analysis let's 
use its words to examine the correlation between   house sleep duration varies with 
physical activity level [Music]   now let's see this graph come into play I mean 
that's where the fun part is it can create so many   interesting graphs I think that's what gets people 
excited really all right this is pretty cool look   at this detailed graph it did this is this is 
legit I'm telling you and it also too explains   the graph shows how it shows its work this is like 
you know when you're in school and they're like   show your work that you did to get to this answer 
this is what that is doing right now so let's see   the scatter plot above shows a correlation between 
physical activity and sleep okay uh we can see a   positive correlation between physical activity 
level and sleep duration yeah I'm not surprised   the level of physical activity increases the 
Sleep duration increases as well so we see here   sleep duration in hours so we go to say eight 
and then as the physical activity level goes   up in time spent on it it correlates to amount of 
time slept so this is pretty cool this is a small   example showing about how you can really uh you 
know analyze your sleep or whatnot like imagine   if you had a aura ring or anything else really 
and you wanted to have a better understanding   of the data behind your health or maybe you're 
doing something for a job interview I'm using   health as an example but this could be used for 
anything actually you know what let's go through   some others examples okay I just found this really 
cool article on medium I want to take you through   because there are some examples that I have yet to 
see being posted on the internet so let's scroll   down a little bit 10 mind-blowing use cases I'll 
link this article down below because I'm not going   to go through them all but SM rayan thank you 
for this all right so easily create all kinds   of graphs we've seen this we we know what this 
is about uh pretty cool though still of course   and gonna be really very helpful for a lot of data 
analysts out there all right convert any GIF into   an mp4 I mean I've seen this one before pretty 
cool though let's see if we open up Twitter here   upload a gif and then it will turn into a 
dramatic slow zoom in effect ah we're not   logged into Twitter I'm on threads I'm not on 
Twitter but you can kind of see it there I am   on Twitter but I don't really use it okay so 
then this one I found to be really cool this   is you can extract the colors from an image 
to create a simple PNG palette that's pretty   wild so what you can do is upload and upload an 
image so let's say a PNG and it will actually   you know what let's just watch this I watched this 
already and I want to share with you let's go here   play create a script that extracts the top five 
colors from a picture and then makes it into a PNG   all right so they're going to 
upload an image here [Music] and then it's going to create a new palette Image 
new PNG with the palette this is wild let's see   working showing its work come on updating the script extracting 
the top colors [Music] can you display the palette PNG now okay this 
is worth it I promise you I know it takes a   bit [Music] this is crazy this is so cool there 
is the color palette that was generated generated   from that image so this is it's getting pretty 
wild out here and it won't be super cliche and   sound like everyone else when we start talking 
about this but this is not going to take over   your job it's going to take over jobs of people 
who don't Embrace this technology I know if I had   a dollar for every time someone told me that I'd 
be like barf I'm done I'm so tired of people here   saying this like come up with your own original 
answer about how AI will affect our jobs but it's   really true this technology will be used a ton 
maybe not in the form of chat GPT I know that's   the plug-in that we were using right now but as 
it continues to expand you can think about how   the technology behind code interpreter could be 
used or there's talks about it already articles   online saying it can be used with say GitHub 
co-pilot or a different kind of AI tools that   help us code better and what does that look like 
and it's one of those things that it's not going   to overtake our jobs we are so far away from that 
and I always say when that point comes that jobs   are taken we're all going to be doomed not just 
programmers not just people in Tech either doomed   or living on a beach like the chip earlier was 
trying to get to but at the end of the day I would   highly suggest you check this out start utilizing 
it and playing around with it seeing how you can   build with it because I really think the opposite 
if you are able to build some really interesting   things with this it will really make you stand 
out to Future employers on your resume showing   you are embracing technology rather than being 
scared of it like this I was gonna do mugs [Music] all right someone uh got to listen 
to me talk today and it was this one   I hope you found this conversation more 
interesting than he did because he didn't   seem to really care about it at all anyways 
hit that subscribe button for more Tech coding   career related content and all right I'll 
see you all soon thanks everyone [Music]
