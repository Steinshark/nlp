so this is why you're addicted to cloud computing well the good news is is that uh it's not going away so let's find out why why are we addicted pre-at called it you're shut up it's not pre-at you might find this hard to believe but amazon.com's retail business isn't very profitable selling consumers cheap Chinese junk is a highly competitive low margin business is that true I thought it made a lot of money I thought it made like bajillions it's very true Amazon makes almost most of their money out that can't be right sorry we got to look that up we got to look that up I just I just don't I just don't believe this I have to I mean maybe you're right uh Amazon uh Amazon Revenue re re Revenue dude I started with an n and I got all sorts of confused there Amazon Revenue where where does the revenue breakdown uh let's see hold on breakdown where's where you know what the breakdown let's see it I want to see this because I I just because it's just such a bold statement okay so if if this one if this were to be believed this is what we see we see online stores at 40% physical stores at three and well that I didn't see coming third party uh seller Services which is also huge this is online store again remember third party seller Services is a huge portion so right now we are sitting at like 70% subscription Services AWS is 15% that's Revenue okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay but what okay okay okay fair okay fair fair uh yeah what is the cost of Revenue I guess the the real question is what is the cost of Revenue uh do we have a cost cost of revenue for this uh Amazon Revenue uh Revenue uh breakdown and cost cuz you want that you want that you want that that cost let's see uh let's see online store over 140 billion from this one 7 90 billion from this wow dude Amazon's made 90 billion from AWS that's so many billions profit breakdown yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah let's see that yeah yeah Amazon no not Revenue let's see that let's see that profit breakdown let's see that profit breakdown how much do you want to bet this is going to be here hold on I think I just saw something that I really wanted to see which is this one this is this is the chart that I was looking for all right let's see online stores physical stores so it shows all these different ones cost of Revenue is about 70 billion then operating experiments fulfillment so 20 billion for fulfillment uh that would be like Personnel I don't know what SNM and G GNA are I don't know what those two are but let's just pretend let's pretend that uh so cost of Revenue versus these ones I'm curious what's I I don't know what the cost of Revenue is versus these ones they don't have a good enough breakdown I was hoping to see this look at that net profit look how thin that gets can we all just take a moment and see that thin Amazon makes a lot of money but doesn't make a lot of money can we just take a can we just take a second here and just pour one out to this that's wild yeah it's actually wild I mean if I'm not mistaken I think Netflix's upcoming projection uh irnet netflix.com if I'm not mistaken Netflix's upcoming projection for this quarter we're going to be making as we're going to be making as much money this is if we make a projection I don't know if we're going to be making our projection is uh what is it uh our net income is two billion we're projecting a two billion income and so therefore therefore we're we're not too far away from Amazon let's go let's go 2.9 billion is still a lot of money proportionately it's kind of L I mean to me this is actually super surprising so I I wish if anyone has a better link you want to provide to me I would be I'd be very very uh happy to to see this right I I'd love to see like what is the cost of this because what I see right here is 50 billion for online store 20 billion for fulfillment okay let's also put all technology and content into the online store okay we're at like 40 billion let's also put these other two okay so that's like that's like the online store pays for the entire operating expenses but then you also have third party seller services you also have subscription that people are largely paying for right you're you're not buying Amazon Prime to save on your AWS Bill and so it's like those two alone right here this is this is primarily used for part of their shipping you got yourself another 20 billion here which is more than than AWS like all together so I just don't believe that AWS costing nothing right uh all the profit is uh from AWS look at the uh second to last line uh on the green line second to last okay hold on which one which one okay H uh from aw look at the second to last on the green line second to last I'm not sure what that means second to last on the green line oh AWS 5.4 billion other well I know but that's first off Bros that dude that that's a counting there just ain't no way is this just I mean is this just ACC counting tricks I I don't know I I it's hard for me it's hard it's hard for me to be like I don't know yes way okay okay okay I believe you yes way no l okay I believe you I believe you that somehow everything else costs them money and AWS is the only thing that is keeping them afloat I believe you I believe you that somehow they made it all the way up till now and they got they got AWS and that's just how it works I don't know about all this anyways we'll keep on going we'll keep on going we're going to keep on going I learned something today that Amazon does not make a lot of money Amazon Inc becomes profitable after you factor in Amazon web services an insane Cash Cow that recently hit operating margins of 30% renting out servers a Ka cloud computing is one of the best business models of the 21st century and nearly every Indie hacker startup and Enterprise is highly addicted to it what they don't tell you is that getting you addicted is essential for the business model to work today you'll learn exactly how Cloud providers lock you in what you can do about it and some new developments that may change things in the future is fireship becoming a dhh fan is that is that what we're is that what I'm hearing right now cuz I'm not going to lie to you this is sounding a little dhh okay uh what what do we do about that I'm I should I be worried on Prem mentioned let's go is February 12th 2024 and you're watching the code report Amazon web services was the original innovator of the cloud when it launched S3 and ec2 back by the way this is probably their best UI they've ever had it's only gone it's only gone downhill since back in 2006 AWS still dominates the market share today with Microsoft's Azure in second and Google Cloud platform in third now can we just take a second here and look at this for for a moment how the hell did Azu are how did they grow how did this happen how how azuer on fire Enterprise B2B dude I am confused by this one like out of all like when you say B2B like almost every place I know uses Amazon it has to it simply has to be government and medical right and then Google Google truly dropped the ball Google the App engine was incredibly easy to use in 2011 like how did Google how did Google fumble the bag so hard can we all take a moment that that is just shocking uh Azure is actually so bad uh used it at work and it just drops packets and messes up my seat my squeal back uh backups it's horrible I that might be a skill issue I just want to warn you that sounds like it could be a skill issue ASU is big in the EU oh nice you got some what let me guess let me guess you got yourself let me guess you got yourself a little nepotism going on in the EU Cloud platform and third now even if you use a boutique platform like brell or netfi you're still actually just using a big cloud provider because they generally resell AWS services at a higher price in exchange you know that's one thing that AWS should just look I mean can we all just take a moment here and think about this for a second these other platforms that just make it easy to release like this and they do have some large percentage markup why isn't Amazon going you know what we should do we should make our UI a touch better hold on what if we made it easier to use like there's I mean AWS could destroy all these other companies like in a moment have you ever thought about how much on a knife's edge you have to be to be like I mean really versell I mean they they obviously do a great job and they're they're light years ahead right now of AWS but at the end of the day if AWS is like we you know what we could do to really to increase this profit of our only profitable sector of our business based on the financial reports that you guys have provided me we could just simply not make a shitty UI have we thought about this that's it let's hire 10 people like how how is that not hard AWS services at a higher price in exchange for a fancy UI and better developer experience what's crazy though is that these companies have the means to stand up their own servers but they're just as locked into AWS as we are and you'll find out why in just a minute now the first step to getting someone addicted to something is to start them when they're young this is what Facebook does with social media and it's why smokers almost always start before they're 18 on the cloud they get the addiction started with the free tier any new account that signs up gets a few hundred bucks for free but if you're a startup and have the right VC behind you you can easily get $100,000 in free AWS credit by the way this is like such an incredible fyan bargain this is like this is absolutely one of the best marketing I have ever seen ever like oh you're a startup $100,000 on us come on in we we love startups AWS somehow has figured out a way to be a VC without being a VC they've invested in every startup ever it is absolutely an incredible incredible idea absolutely amazing uh love it I I it's honestly I hats off to them hats off it's an awesome deal for a Founder but Amazon is playing the long game if your startup doesn't fail they're going to make a 100 times that amount off you in the future in addition Cloud pricing models are extremely complex by Design the more like I I'm curious how much you know like I have no idea how much Netflix pays I'm sure I could go figure out but I don't know but we you know Netflix uses Amazon and so like what is that bill right what is any of these big bills to these big companies what do you think Uber uses what do you think Lyft uses you think they're all rolling their own River Farms no they're probably all on AWS paying some incredible amount of money Bill and my company's 86,000 a month sh that's crazy slack will I mean to be fair with slack slack is literally a few SNS cues and the inability to reconnect a websocket slack is single-handedly the stupidest company that has ever existed on Earth in fact slack the reason why I've recently decided that dhh might actually be right is the fact that is is slack slack is the reason why I think that dhh could be right okay it is it is the reason I I in fact I even started following the guy after after his campfire stuff he made this campfire stuff wherever it is I once right or whatever it's called Uh anyways dude the guy is like coming in at like 0.001% the cost of slack and selling it to companies that thing is going to be a 10 that thing is going to be a nine figure product it's going to be so so so good the guy's a genius absolutely awesome great good good on him for making something that's going to be a slack competitor honestly it's Absolut it's absolutely insane that slack makes as much money as they do and they don't even have an effing reconnecting socket yo dog it's like 10 lines of code I wrote it in a tweet once doesn't slack suck yes slack does suck it can't even have just reconnecting socket how hard is a reconnecting socket on error retry get get retry weight amount that can be exponential on close reconnect it's not that hard there's two points pings happen every 30 seconds every 60 seconds you will know within 30 seconds to on average if it's a one minute wait that you need to reconnect like this is not even that hard okay sorry let's keep on going sorry slack slack triggers me slack is just the stupidest company ever the price model the harder it is to determine the actual cost implications of switching providers and for Enterprise they offer long-term discounts and additional support which can be worth billions of dollars when you have customers like the Pentagon getting you in the door is pretty obvious but once you're in they also need ways to make it hard for you to leave and one way they do that is by charging out R by the way that old meme old old meme this is real this is like Fire Ship given Boomer energy on memes right now get hard for you to leave and one way they do that is by charging outrageous egress fees egress is when data leaves the network as opposed to Ingress when data comes into the cloud which is generally free that means if you use a cloud storage bucket and upload say a few pedabytes worth of data then decide you want to go to a different Cloud you're going to have a massive Bill to move that data from one Cloud to the other people generally switch clouds to save money but when you factor in that data transfer bill it's usually not worth it like when interesting is this wait hold is this dhh mentioned it's like a can see into the future 37 signals migrated away from the cloud they were looking at A3 to $400,000 S3 bill just to move the data there is some good news though that's so crazy to think about I never once thought about how S3 has this competitive Advantage for not leaving I've never once thought about that that that is like it's you know for for for go the business practices okay for go for go feeling whether or not that is like ethically a good thing um it's an absolutely amazing idea okay like that wow I'm shook I a fantastic fantastic business like slapy on the way out yeah like oh you want to leave yeah the door will hit you on the way out I just want to let you know the door hits you and it's it's it's exceptional it's exceptional right just a few days ago Google Cloud removed transfer fees when migrating away from Google Cloud that's great news for developers because it breaks down the barriers of vendor lockin however some people saw this as a sign that Google Cloud will be killed soon in which also yeah that sounds also honestly that just sounds stupid by Google's behalf um you don't get anything by that right like what are you attempting to win hey people come leave us easier oh that's the reason why I'm coming over to Google Cloud Google app engine right like that's not that's like you there's there's no I don't see how that's a benef like I don't see how you can use that as marketing right what people want from marketing is they want the ability EU regulatories okay it could be EU regulator let's just pretend it's EU regulatories but uh or regulations but like what people want is good developer experience you already know Amazon fumbled that bag so hard that there's there's literal rent Seekers that just make a nice UI around Amazon like that's how bad it is it's a it's like a several billion it's like a 10 or 11 figure cottage industry around how bad a UI is and so there's a huge opportunity there so I'm I'm shook that this is the direction they went in case I would lose this highly unfortunate beted I made last year that's why I think this is actually a sign of product strength and will hopefully motivate other clouds to do the same and by the way there's a 0% chance Google Cloud shuts down anytime soon as it just hit profitability in 2023 according to Gemini this move might be related to the eu's data act which is looking to crack down on cloud egress fees take a look at this breakdown on get deo.com platforms like cloudflare are totally free while bare metal providers like lenoe and hetner are very reasonable but as we get up to aw Leno mentioned by the way Leno's a great company I actually have always really appreciated the smaller providers cuz you can like email somebody you know what I mean you can email somebody and it's and you get to talk to them and it's nice like I I was sponsored by lenoe a long time ago uh I actually never took a single dollar from them I just really liked them they just gave me some free hosting and and it was it was really nice they sold out no they I mean dude first off if you were in charge of a company and you could sell to aamai for a billion dollars or whatever it was come on come on don't be stupid you would do it acting like getting the bag is somehow is somehow selling out dude right now if kick the the abhorrent streaming service came up to me and was like yo yo hey yo baby Prime you want $2 million to come stream over on Kick I'd be like hell yeah hell yeah kick I'm coming on over tell me what I got to do do I got to wear make America great again hat hell yeah give me that $2 million like right like I'm not I'm not stupid of course I'm going to take the bag right like well come on like who wouldn't do that you guys are crazy and so do I blame lenoe at all for saying like hey we don't have to ma we don't have to manage anything and we get a billion dollars go get a billion dollars okay come on stupid stupid it's stupid by the way this is crazy down here can we just take a moment and look at this Google Cloud depends on the service is $111 per uh some per some amount of gigabyte render 100 gigabytes to one terabyte is $300 for sell 100 gabt to 1 terabyte is $400 netlify 100 gabt to 1 terabyte is $550 that's a lot of money that's that's crazy well yeah but that's if you wanted to leave right like if you wanted to leave and you contained a lot of memory that's crazy that's a lot of of money that's how you rent seek son that's how you rent seek netlify is like wait a second if Amazon's making money off of egress and we're using Amazon we make money off of egress you got to pay me while you're paying them to leave okay you got to pay like every time you stack one of these conveniences on you got to pay somebody on the way out like how does that work with clerk like really how does that work with clerk I'm curious because you know you have these like authentication Services if you want to switch authentication Services how much does it how much does it cost to leave it is literally techn feudalism we got feudal Lords now it's actually very it's very interesting and Azure we see the free allowance decrease incre but then it gets even worse when we look at platforms like forcell and NFI they're basically pricing their bandwidth at five times what AWS charges them pretty clever but why don't they just buy their own servers to reduce these costs even further well as you can see their infrastructure is highly dependent on AWS and their egress fees would be as astronomical and another thing is that many database companies like say mongodb give you the option to choose a cloud when you create an account well if you're a customer with a massive data set it's going to be extremely expensive to use this service if it's not on the same cloud and essentially that forces every Big Data SAS company into the cloud and that's why Jeff Bezos has a $500 million yacht with a figure head of his girlfriend on the bow and you don't but data transfer absolutely real ABS AB dude absolutely real and I just want let you know that I have never wanted a yacht and then all of the sudden I want a yacht with a figure head of my wife on there just want I want to kick kick you know I'm just saying if you want to make a deal you know if you want to make a deal fees are just one small way to get locked in another big issue is proprietary technology all the big clouds have their own custom databases which are closed source and not easy to migrate to other platforms even if you use an open lib squeal People Source database like postgress or MySQL you'll likely use a fully managed service like RDS in which case you're reliant on the cloud to scale the infrastructure and handle things like security updates and the surround to be fair the database stuff I have less of a concern about I mean migrating obviously migrating from one database service to another is is most certainly a pain in the ass and probably requires some level of downtime uh database management is extremely hard like if if you if you cross I mean there's obviously a line in which it's not hard you know when you have no customers it's like not hard if you have 10 customers it's not hard but but once you cross a certain line it database database is really hard it's it's really hard lib squeal is dope lib squeal is dope that's why I love turo again the two founders of turo they they did so much of silid DB they're extremely smart they're awesome I like them uh dang need ecosystem I just don't want I just don't want to do database management honestly that's like the one thing I will avoid I would rather pay more money to avoid that integrated all the products work great when they're on on the same Cloud but most things aren't standardized to work properly outside that cloud and sometimes that can even include open source tools when you build your infrastructure around custom apis and proprietary Tech it becomes harder and harder to just transfer things elsewhere but nobody wants to be a slave to the cloud so what do we do about it well we have three main options option one is to not use the cloud at all instead you buy your own server and get some static IP addresses and try to manage everything by yourself it'll be way more expensive UPF front way more labor intensive to maintain it won't be as fault tolerant or secure but could pay off in the long this option doesn't make a lot of sense for hackers but makes a lot of sense for mediumsized businesses like base camp which claims it'll sa it also he he's not even mentioning uh a ref uh this one right here how a ref saved 400 million in three years by not going to the cloud yeah Cloud can get pretty expensive people Cloud Uber it can get Uber expensive there there there comes a point where you have to think about what you're doing wasn't that debunked to be a less impressive number it was still it was it was like it was still in the we're talking about I I think I remember reading something about that but it was still into the into the nine figure business it was very very large I remember someone being like actually it's like a 100 million it's just like oh okay that's still that's still like a lot that's like a lot of money that's like that's like a crazy that's like crazy amounts of money $7 million over the next five years by moving off of the cloud option two is to use the cloud responsibly and by that I mean use open source technologies that are aable which will then allow you to use a multicloud strategy where you pick and choose the best services from each of the major clouds or a hybrid strategy where you use your own hardware for some things and the cloud for others then finally option three is to embrace the addiction pick a cloud and take the easy way out with all their proprietary Tech the cloud is not supposed to be cheaper what you're paying for is convenience bare metal minus pain equals AWS AWS minus pain equals verell the real question is how much pain are you willing to tolerate this has been the code report thanks for watching and I will see you in the next one damn damn I still can't believe they they literally they literally merch me my own stuff all the time damn that was Wild Fire Ship is so funny and I can't stop thinking about that guy doing all those cartwheels uh that was a great video um I think he's spot I mean I honestly I think he's spoton which is what are what are you going to do what are what are you g to do yes I do like asmin gold okay what are you gonna do you know as a startup it it it literally makes no sense to try to uh roll your own cloud right you have to embrace the all right so okay so like this is so long I don't know if I want to read read it all AWS uh is there anything new let's see Amazon fourth quarter results uh net sales increased 14% gosh gosh that's so much money uh that just so dang much money uh operating income net income increase to 10 let's see to 10 billion uh in the fourth quarter or $1 per diluted share let's see compare it to let's see 0.3 billion or in the fourth quarter 2022 oh wow they've really gone up in the Moonies they're really doing okay well I guess now I mean I guess Netflix's projection now doesn't look that good uh fourth quarter let's see do we have anything that says about AWS that makes more sense AWS AWS uh operating income was uh 24.6 billion compared to the operating income of 20 22 so a a moderate a moderate increase let's see uh for let's see let's see AWS continued long-term focus of customers and feature delivery what features are you delivering coupled with our new gen capabilities okay yeah see I don't I don't want to have to read through I mean honestly I don't want to have to read through all of this and get it all a poultry two billion weak right if if someone can just like teal the Army because or else I'm just going to say congratulations or I'm sorry right I think it's a wrong to propose a hybrid or multicloud solution I think you're absolutely right on this one uh multicloud solution is crazy honestly it's it's super crazy it's it's extremely difficult ain't no way you're going to be able to successfully multicloud easily you know what I mean ain't no way you're going to do it successfully don't do that it's it's it's silly just do do something better Goku could do well you're ain't Goku okay you ain't Goku but the name you know what the name is say it say it say it it's the aggress Gen okay everyone knows that
