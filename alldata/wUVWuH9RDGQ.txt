this is Adam he's relatively new here which makes it all the more impressive how much stuff he's managed to steal from the office what there's no way that you bought a stack it has an inventory label on it I want it one Jerry rig everything knife criminal scum stolen no those are given away yeah by who now all I gotta do is give one to everyone on my team did you hear him he said I might be hard-pressed hard pressed to find these cable ties I purchased those I have the bag if you steal them they still come in the packaging uh this passport is this even you 4K that's just for testing purposes because the only way I can listen to Dolby Atmos music is through theft and now for my finishing move the cupboard you thought I wouldn't open completely full um Tech items what do you think this is you won an AMD ultimate Tech upgrade or something like that yeah I did that's right guys we're back it's brought to you by AMD and we're gonna be doing a five thousand dollar Tech makeover and you really need it because quite frankly I don't think you've stolen enough stuff I'm a good boy good boy with a bad computer hey foreign [Music] we are super excited to have partnered up with AMD on the next generation of tech upgrades to celebrate the launch of the new series AMD is giving away some goodies to a few lucky viewers head on over to our Twitter to enter the giveaway for a chance to win one of five AMD 6750xt gpus thanks again to AMD for sponsoring this series these are all the routers I've accrued from various isps over the years why do you keep them I steal from the man so you're saying I'm not the man no you're one of us it's cool this is my upgrade oh well then what's this RX Vegas I brought that from Calgary because I thought maybe I could fix it at work the nfg stands for no good and I have not bothered to try and repair it and its value only diminishes by the day the computer itself is not what's bad here what's bad is the situation of the computer is this really how you're learning about computers this is from a video game so it's like really crappy documentation that would be really hard to read and here's I'll show you my favorite page it's just entirely in Mandarin but it's a really cool game zaktronic great developer rest in peace very cool that was from CES a robot drew that of me Excellence why is this on your desk it's it's for the think server so I have a think server that's behind the TV these are for the hard drive base yeah and this is in case you need to charge something and this is in case you need to charge another thing losing it audio return to Shay oh yeah should I use that yeah I guess you borrowed it from Shea no that no she borrowed it from me that's why it's labeled because I would never label my things for all the good it did you he never returned it never returns anything in this house it's a good thing we lived together wow oh this was almost certainly stolen from work find the asset tagline is we don't tag these Ah that's my very own custom keyboard yeah I love the keycaps that's a very fun Legend I really like them they feel really really good to type on VR headset conveniently positioned for well you know uh the one thing I have put away and he just roasts me for it the one thing you have put away that I'm roasting you for why do you have speakers behind your monitor it is truly the greatest of all sins a monitor too big we're gonna fix that David do you accept this I thought you claimed to be like a music lover like a music lover you got all this vinyl here and then you put speakers behind a display they don't need to be in front of the display they can handle being behind it did you know he also wears headphones like this that's why this is here it really it really does the highs on it they can be a little sharp I mean I guess your new sound bar is gonna go behind the TV you don't even have your VR Lighthouse plugged in no so uh this credenza was part of the upgrade and it blocks some of this right we're just going to drill a hole through it we're going to put a power bar in here so that I can route all my cables through and then have everything kind of just kind of go around the corner in all seriousness though I was I said your computer's not good earlier but I actually don't even know what's in here inside we have a AMD 5600x as the CPU oh so you already have like a pretty sick machine yes but I also have two 4K ish displays and this is a 5700 XT and that can't really do 4K no it can't what is up with your cooler uh sir I took off the fans that came on the GPU and attached my own knock to a fence to it I did a repaste new thermal pads and a thorough application of cat hair yeah that uh something cool I noticed about this is it appears that you've created a custom pwm adapter so that I guess these fans are actually running off of the gpus fan header yeah so the board's totally controlled by uh drivers it's great oh that's awesome see in the past when we've done these things I didn't think to do that to be perfectly honest with you and I've always just run them off of a header on the motherboard so you're just kind of hoping that the Fan's been fast enough in that case are we just upgrading the GPU or no I saw a motherboard in there we're upgrading everything okay you're keeping this case though yes the case is the same the cooler is the same drives are the same okay uh you would not believe the amount of money I've wasted on noctua fans in my life I assume those fans are here uh nope screenshot did you really get suckered into buying a screen cleaner kit you actually just bought like three of these what do you mean I bought three of these well your company bought them why we have water man this is already becoming extremely unstructured I guess we're just gonna have to why don't you do the computer with it sure you why don't you work on the AV stuff because I would have you work on the desk but it's obvious from both your desk here and your desk at work that you're not capable of it I love this this guy all like I am not a thief yeah hell yeah love Death Grips stay anointed okay and here I have the Samsung q990b their Flagship sound bar they kind of push the definition of sound bar these days because it all also comes with you satellites and then there's a big ass subwoofer well where the hell are we gonna put all this it's the exact same question that I asked there's room there's room okay [Music] Adam okay you want compressed air no I got compressed air right here oh my gosh it's something do you want to put the case on something so you don't scratch this shoot do I have that panel on still oh yeah oh no I did I scratched it I'm sorry yeah that's okay it goes under the desk be free that went directly onto my neighbor's balcony in size this is old sound bar this is new sound bar yeah oh whoops remember kids don't forget to twist then pull did you break it no oh no it's a little bent I was gonna use that still I can fix it I can fix it okay trust me I'm a professional if it's broken I'm definitely stealing one from work if it's broken by the time you use it it'll be because you broke it I'm gonna give it to you in working condition there it's perfect oh you're actually using the think server oh your fireplace is here I see what the heck is supposed to go up there this apartment was built in the early 2000s this is where you'd put a CRT television I gotta ask is this like a nomadic lifestyle kind of thing like you guys move around a lot you don't want to put up real art or uh we wanted to see if the art would look good if the shapes made sense so oh so I so that's part of the thing today I was wondering if you could hang them actually I see yes I think you've done a fine job then great they're all labeled so the stack of uh art on the side of the desk you can that's where they go terrific I realize the signs don't make sense Bunny Fufu Little Bunny Foo Foo hopping through the force right I too was a child in the 90s see so this one is called the unbearable remorse of Little Bunny Foo Foo okay it made me laugh I forget in the song does Little Bunny Foo Foo ever learn I think he ends up being alone and like the great isn't it the Great Fairy what does she do at the end of the song does she like kill him is Dolby Atmos baby you know what we need in a very small apartment surround sound that's needed I'm excited for you to attempt to prove me wrong well it is for me yeah so you've you've been proven wrong where the hell are you gonna put these surrounds you you guessed one of them what the hell you're gonna put more speakers behind your monitor is good yeah we got a monitor arm for it I mean you could make just you could that's probably a better spot for it compared to having some of the uh left firing speakers and all I hear is justify justify rationalize who does up their fan like this who does that what fan like what your fan wasn't screwed in all the way this might be a tall order for someone who didn't bother to screw their fan in all the way but um do you have a feather duster yeah I do I do okay I do I do it's not feather it's a Swiffer Duster yeah that's fine this looks like the comb over my old boss at NCIX had he watches sometimes so hopefully he doesn't see that come on these awful USB 3 connectors oh yeah the plastic housing came off the board with the connector well no but I mean someone will someday I am selling it to Harrison I'm giving it to Harrison because he needs a new one you're giving it to him because you said selling yeah I know but then I sounded greedy and I didn't like it oh you're just gonna stack them yeah man this is seriously where you're putting this to for now I can't even use North American swear words to express how I feel mailed he's lucky none of this light's on fire it's also cool how you got this out without even disengaging the lock yeah that's really cool it's really efficient yeah if you're just saving time left right in the center oh sorry I had the motherboard there it was an accident HR this is very tedious work but it's gonna be worth it the last thing you want is a brand new build with some stanky Dusty disgusting fan in it that draws your eye to it immediately oh don't get that close too close too close nope I also picked up a 12 terabyte EXO's hard drive this is re-certified it only had 32 hours on it we did a whole video about how you can buy a used hard drive now it's okay yeah that's that's used it's not research they weren't recertified what's the this is this is like what they did is that they just replaced the memory controller on it right well who knows it's gonna exactly who knows that's the whole point you don't know what they did to recertify it tyvee told me to buy it and he's the biggest storage nerd I know right now ask him if he has any recertified drives in his computer in his Android server he says it's full of them does he yeah do you know what's really annoying about these thing servers they just come with these little things right clean up the front of the port right so why would you injection mold just a little bit more plastic to hold a hard drive when you can injection mold garbage that goes into a landfill and you can sell hard drive mounts for twenty dollars a pop the hard part when there's no caddies you just kind of have to shove it in there and hope it goes in the slot I noticed you have a new power supply that makes sense yeah you're running a 7900 XTX yeah uh okay so that's why we've got this Cooler Master 850 watt 80 plus gold modular power supply I'm in the 750 might have done it but it would have been like yeah I had issues with the 5700 XT spiking with transients and shutting the whole computer off so so based on your issues you bought the exact same power supply but at a slightly higher rating the only one you can get that goes higher is like a thousand watt power supply and it's like 400 bucks and I didn't want to pay for that I had a budget I mean I hope this is at least a new revision that handles transient spikes better I did a lot of testing to make sure that this wouldn't be a problem you claim to care about noise because you've got anti-vibration nonsense on things and you're not screwing your fans in all the way but then you're mounting an SSD so it's sitting in your case like this it never bothered me you've gone b650i aorus Ultra for the new one ddr5 two and a half gig Lan that's going to give you a nice fast access to whatever's on your Nas do you have two and a half gig land on your Nas nope cool remember back in the day you'd buy a step down motherboard and be like oh well there's no overclocking and like crummy USB support and I sure hope you don't want to put any m.2 drives in there not anymore what's cool about this platform is that even though this is their b650 mid-tier chipset it does have support for pcie Gen 5 storage so in the future if Gen 5 drives are ever necessary three m.2s supported on this board there's your two and a half gig Lan lots of USB 3 and of course overclocking support thanks AMD and then for our CPU we've gone 7600x this is about the bang for the buccanist like gaming CPU out there right now I'm loving this thing I wanted an x3d chip but the timing didn't work out yeah X 3D ryzen 7000 is looking like it's going to be sick what are you doing with that old sound bar I'm probably just gonna sell it it's a good bar I'll buy it okay how much uh like a hundred for me for me 65. you said 60 before I'll give you 75. 75 it goes to him here's another great demonstration of how monstrous this thing is it's the size of the love seat the amount of tech things that you bring into this home what happened oh you made the mistake I put the cooler on before screwing in the board which I guess explains why you only had three screws which I guess means that since there's only three screws anyway I couldn't have put this top left one in anyhow also plug in the cables oh good call I have learned that lesson every time I've built on that computer 6000 Mega transfers per second cl32 AMD Expo ready it's almost like I reviewed that CPU hey it's nice we can have our less knowledgeable writers write CPU reviews now that the labs gives them everything in all seriousness though Adam's very knowledgeable but I think the lab helped out a lot yeah the lab was amazing that was a very stressful time I don't know James says I have a stressed face but I don't know what it is does your stress face look like your pooping face you've seen my pooping Oh I thought you meant like you uh hey Adam you're aware that the middle fan is supposed to be a 140 millimeter fan yup I can't remember what happened to it because that was the unique like circular fan that had the 120 millimeter mounts on a 140 millimeter fan okay if you break this before I'm not gonna break it yeah that's what you said with the server that you broke yesterday oh you have a problem what do I have a problem with the fan is too high well then lower the fan I can't lower the fan because your USB 3 connector is there oh my God Linus did we break the USB 3 everything's fine oh no Adam you didn't I didn't put in the back fan oh wait good yes oh yeah how am I gonna plug it in though yeah have you gotten the fan headers where are the fan headers on this board hold on a second there's a little m.2 looking slot called f-panel card I wonder if that contains the front panel headers and also SATA ports it does okay I'm doing this ergotron monitor stand I think that the current mounting should be fine this is an Ikea tabletop but I don't think I have to worry about it getting crushed under the weight of the monitor arm yo dog I heard you like weird little adapters that SATA card has a header for the front panel connectors it's like hey we figure you know what you're building small form factor anyway realistically did you intend to Cable manage and I found your fan headers I didn't recognize them because they're non-standard they have dongles and what is this now another dongle this is USB 2 headers where's the front panel audio connector now in the interest of completeness it has to be plugged in oh my God I didn't do it under my last month it has to be plugged in Adam this is Ultimate Tech upgrade not half-assed Tech upgrade one front panel audio header routed from the adapter card on the rear panel what oh my God I found it when you're troubleshooting your DAC you'll be happy that you've got this quality onboard audio I don't even use this one I accidentally won three dads how do you accidentally win three dash I only want to put my name in at the Christmas party can I get a hand with the monitor either from Shea or lioness I'm working on the most difficult computer I've ever built so oh I'm lifting this uh would you rather screw I want to do anything that's what she said get out of my house wait you okay yeah oh we in got the audio cable in now and the pcie slot is clear is it done yeah yay look at that I can do this I can show off my speakers [Laughter] yeah you could have so many more loose cables in your desk yeah and magic cards and receipts and a gift card to Canadian Tire how much do you appreciate this storage of copious amounts of physical music when it could all be stored in literally nothing I see what you're saying I'm a pretty sentimental person look at the fridge boxes and books those are very those are lastly and nicely arranged what do you mean these are alphabetized except for the one shelf I was gonna say something it's Barbra Streisand everyone carries lioness yeah this is very nice Art thank you it's collected over many years I don't like get art but like this seems like you know art which is good how do I put this I won't pay for things that just like sit there lots of my friends are artists and sell this stuff and I was like see I don't have friends can this little thing oh here's a step stool just in case no no just okay you don't have to do it Jesus that credenza's new it's part of the upgrade oh does this even fit in here I think it's just going over the whole thing just don't touch the wall yeah stop touching it like as long as you know you know yeah what an advantage being tall is you can like reach so well and do such a good job right listen how many HDMI ports are on that XTX too I think two or is it gonna be three DP and one HDMI what's the point of asking me if you just want me to change my answer to whatever you think could you check you need to just trust the tech tips man when he says there's one there's only one why do you only have one wand what do you think I'm doing with the other hand not this is what I have to live with you're just telling on it because you're imagination it's been eight years at this it's an investment yeah that's called the sun cost this could be the very first one of these upgrades where I actually break up a couple yeah the computer was fine my relationship's in shambles spent like seven minutes looking for this tray is important it's the last piece for this beautiful wall did you want to level any of the other things too or just this one you can level all of them well no I just mean maybe this is the style like I don't get art right like I've already said that no so is this the point it's a metaphor metaphor definitely a metaphor yeah never metaphor I didn't like but some of those sixes bad people did you just rate my girlfriend did I interpret that no no six linuses I have to confess Adam I'm a little worried about getting enough airflow to this GPU but I guess that's your problem not mine because this baby is closed up and ready to go good luck everybody I'm still working on cable management right now are you though I just started working on cable management now have you though oh my God you have like the other ends of cables down here this DisplayPort cable is not going to reach the computer at all Adam even when you cable manage you've managed to up in 5 000 US Dollars you couldn't find budget for a little cable tray or something I'm like I coulda why don't we route it through here no it's not I asked this guy why is the cord for your power bar running through this and he's like oh oh you know because when you push it back it has to be right but why isn't it under here why is it why are you putting it up here because I was sitting in my chair I do not see what you're criticizing me about it's perfectly logical decision making ryzen 7000. Onboard video boom second HDMI output oh dang but but wait no I need that for gaming well no you should still be able to route your dedicated GPU through your onboard or whatever like they do on laptops yeah I would keep the dedicated HDMI port on the GPU for the Vive okay let's try it now let's find it we'll find out yeah we'll see if amd's drivers can handle it oh yeah we also got this Instax Mini Evo as part of a what well it's for me this is an instant camera uh that you can see digitally on the back so it's a digital camera yeah with a printer bolted to it yeah and so now I can actually see if the if it's worth printing or not because these are expensive it's like a dollar a picture if only there was a cheaper way to print out pictures if only there's an Essence to the printing of this type of film yeah an essay you can't capture really with spoken like a true vinyl collector we could let's go see I'm old enough I actually remember using film cameras like because I had to because I'm like cool and trendy and I have a film camera now you want to take photos out no we have other films oh I don't doubt that you have film cameras that one we have actual we have actual videos I know I believe you does that work yep that's awesome can you still get film for those two yeah shut up that much you didn't just waste one on that did you yeah I don't have a picture but look at this cable management that's better that's my feet are gonna be really happy yeah what the hell is there still so much stuff on here why is there leather balm on your desk I have ADHD and if things and if things are put away they stop existing and therefore I don't do them if you want to hang that bracket which you've definitely got to that reminds me I need to fix the closet door she has the same problem we're all problems did you see you worked on my desk you saw how with it I'll fix it all right okay um we're gonna turn this upgrade around Mister am I gonna be the first one to point out that those are Google glasses oh my God they are oh they are the Google did you guys not notice this is like the next gen like like the trendier glass hole look glass hole what that's what people call it's like super no Google Glass do you know what Google I know what Google Glass is yeah the Google Glasses everyone called them glass holes because it's a nice thing for you to tell me no no okay TV yeah so the TV you'll notice that a couple inches of the TV is cut off you know what actually it isn't what really yeah I'm losing the bottom millimeters but only if I'm like this the picture came out it looks very 1970s yeah wait did you put it up I don't want a picture of my boss on my friend I think it's the bed and grab ice cream and they're like oh yeah work tomorrow okay pretty close to the end of the pile of junk on this desk this is just creepy why do you need this here do you know about this habit no no my mom bought them for me and not for you to do that with them there's a bar right beside our building and sometimes fights happen here thank you yeah no problem little State like a staple well he might forget about that yeah what do you need to staple Adam your mouth shut here we go everyone does it turn on um this is the monitor plugged in I think the power bar is not on the blue yeah I thought it was illuminated yeah it was thanks Jay you made it worse and it's booted uh oh Kernel Security check failure don't take my chicken for someone with so many ISP provided routers you don't have very many ethernet cables over by your computer there's one cable to there the switch then I have a big old cable oh my God I don't want your life story I just want to know where the cable is oh okay it's yeah I have a big one right because why would it be anywhere other than here on the couch and that's where you told me to put it buried in the I didn't tell you to put this anywhere I I never tell them to put any cables anywhere why to prepare that's away for Adam he put it between the couch cushions poor hapless Adam you just I'm not hapless I have so many haps all the apps yeah we're even mean oh 30 seconds but it's been here for like an hour nothing tests the strength of a couple's relationship like hanging things on the wall honestly there's lots of things on the wall so that should just speak to the endurance of our relationship yeah you know what I'm gonna let you guys put this up when you're done with that you guys are doing such a wonderful job of it I believe in you um what if that record is not like a standard record size they're all the same size Linus no that's not even true oh yeah you lived through this guy gives me this and goes just take a Phillips head and freaking stick it into the wall tackle and stuff like that spackle Enthusiast it's a real problem for us financially he's buying spackle and it just leaves it out and it dries up and the cost is storing it my God you know it's a funny thing because immediately when I mute the SOS of the people I work with we have like this connection we both have to by choice we tolerate these people I'm just going for this you did say you were very comfortable with spackle right oh me and spackle go way back spackle and I you're a professional writer now I remember I had the wrong there and a title once and you just you just stared at your monitor for 30 seconds and then you turned and said really I had no excuse I had nothing I thought it was funny and and deserved what happened okay now this wall might be metal it's like paper thin the wood is right there I've never seen anything like that before is it are these plaster walls there's a there's the breaker box here maybe that's what they did maybe they put a piece of thing to make to stop people from this from drilling into the like in the if it was in the if it was in the paragraph it wouldn't have felt bad it was in the titles section like the the most thought is spent on the fewest words in the time I I I can be less passive aggressive and you're not passive aggressive you're just aggressive Oh Come this is a really really nice guy oh she's so nice I've ever met that's fine I know it's not I'm looking at that it's all man you'll never do any better it's all men well it's a good thing I'm queered see look touch it it's quality oh that's pretty cool see I told you things are going really well here all the drivers are installed all we got to do now is let's hope that Expo is going to enable perfectly and we're going to run this Ram at 6 000 Mega transfers per second here we go and wish me luck do you want a chair no I'm sitting on one isn't it a comfy love seat yeah but that was also part of the upgrade oh we got that we got that sexy couch all right um uh no we didn't manage to do 6 000 out of the box all right time for a bias update I just realized something you weren't willing to spend like four dollars on a cable management Channel but you probably blew like 500 bucks on nanoleaf lights I appreciate nanoleaf's attention to detail making their controller would but the cable's still just a white cable could they not have made it also a wood cable wood grain cable yeah dude that would look so sick Adam do we need to clean probably the horrendous it's plugged it's a it's a power cable plugged into a power strip plugged into it oh my God there's just a hanging here no we gotta do that still yeah just drill it just do it be a man you got this no come on real men don't check wait are you actually not going to check real men measure twice and cut once damn [Music] um uh oh my God oh my God you almost started a fire that is so much very smoky she is burned baby nope yeah sorry a chair is part of the upgrade in that case yes yeah Logitech gaming chair priorities the chair you're keeping yeah but as as what not to keep it am I missing something here I don't know just don't do the math holy this is a 1700 chair how does the math work for this upgrade you bought a couch and wine and a credenza and an 1100 Soundbar I was hoping you wouldn't notice then that's why I bought it gonna make me do that which is why I'm bringing this chair back for its second upgrade debut mom said no maybe dad'll say yes strategy right there Mom and Dad said no because Colton said no and you said no it's 2023 you can have two dads it's fine this is David's chair from his Tech upgrade I got it because I needed a chair and I didn't want to spend more than 50 on it this is definitely not as good yeah can confirm I hate to speak openly about a dilemma that I have um that's an ominous start the sound bar it only has digital inputs yeah the record player it only has analog output then maybe you should get with the times and use Spotify Dax cheap right easy to get Spotify oh you just need an ADC that's not hard to find what are you talking about no there's like none that exists yeah I know do you know how hard this was it almost it was literally on Amazon and he goes do you know how hard this was to find but what if this sounds like crap I don't know if it's gonna sound poo poo it's vinyl so it's already gonna sound like that's not you don't understand why I listened to vinyl it's not because I think it sounds better well then this doesn't matter if it's crap then yes it does because I don't want it to sound alert then why do you listen to vinyl I'm dying today holy I can't catch a break vinyl is a way better way to support artists than Spotify Frankly Speaking most of what I listen to is like Taylor Swift anyway and I think she's funny what do you think about the new album what do you think about midnights I kind of sounds like it kind of sounds like good thing I only spent 20 bucks on these this is the cleanest I've ever seen my desk thank you so much oh my pleasure and your feet will be so pleased if only the computer would turn on it's so quiet though that I can't really tell I guess a good problem to have it'll be good later when it isn't a problem I also got this and the Kai mpk mini plus it's a midi controller keyboard it's got pads it's got knobs and the reason I got this was because when I moved here so I had to kind of get rid of my instruments I could I used to play drums and bass guitar and I've really really been missing that I don't actually know how to play keys but I have been practicing also I don't know how to use Ableton ableton's really confusing please send help I love how for most of these upgrades the space at the end like you know looks like kind of tidier we're doing our best out here it's a it's a permanent state of chaos and it's 90 my fault yeah this is like uh this looks fine oh my God he's not just gonna put that down there is he he is he's totally gonna just put that he's just he's just gonna put it down what the hell your neighbors are going to murder you I mean this Subs a little bit much for this space uh yeah let's turn that down the sub was at -4 that wasn't even full what is gonna was it's gonna wrap the house [Music] it's great we got the BIOS updated and check it out Adam you're going to be pleased as punch uh we gaming boys I don't know if we're gaming yeah I think your windows installed might be messed up Explorer just crashed your Ram's gonna get six thousand Mill yeah I'm pretty sure this is because we didn't do a clean install continuing Adam's upgrade is my little mini here uh we have a wireless mouse it's from Logitech what made you choose these I love the color black um see it's an easy switch that's definitely the reason I chose it foreign it's cool it creates two cubes that are the same size [Music] this has been the first episode of AMD ultimate Tech upgrade I hope you guys enjoyed it as much as these guys are going to be enjoying their new Dolby Atmos surround sound system to go with the 4K TV and speaking of 4K the 4K ish I mean but almost 4K it's the resolution of this thing 5120 by 1440. I mean that's like 4K and with the 7900 XTX playing like what uh Yakuza like a dragon I'm gonna be playing for spoken maybe if I'm gonna look at it it looks pretty and I'm gonna be playing seeing you guys at the next AMD ultimate Tech upgrade my understanding is it's supposed to be my wife and my wife and no one will tell me what the theme is
