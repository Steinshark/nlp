- Being a waitress is one of the hardest jobs in the world. That's why today, we're
gonna be tipping waitresses with gold bars, PlayStations,
TVs, laptops and more. - What can I get you fellas to drink? - Can I have a water?
- I'll take a water as well. - This is a gold bar. It is worth $160,000. I can't afford to tip that just yet. So what we did is we got mini gold bars. Chris, is that a mini gold bar? - It is a mini gold bar. This right here is $7,000 in gold. I know it's tiny but gold is expensive. This is seven smackaroonis,
seven bands, seven racketeers. - All right, we got it. How is your water? - It tasted like seven grand. What does that say, Chris? - "7K in gold" with a really weird G. - And we put the gold. All right, it was good water. - Let's go.
- Yeah. - Is this true or no? Thank y'all so much.
- Of course. Where are we? - Garden Olives. - Hello.
- Hello. - How are you doing today?
- Doing good, how you doing? - I'm good.
- Can I have a water? - Yeah, you sure can. - Mm. Oh my goodness, Chris. - I'll be right back.
- This water. - Is it good?
- Mm. - Would you say it's the
best water you've ever had? - Mm hmm. Chris is gonna go pee. So this time, we're doing
it a little different. We're gonna tip a
PlayStation and a laptop. "Enjoy your new PS4 and laptop." Congratulations.
- Thank you so much. Y'all subscribe to MrBeast, thank you. - Can I have a water?
- Sure. - I'll have your finest water, please. It tastes like a TV. - That might be your mustache. - Ooh. - Ooh.
- I love this bread. - That bread is fire. - All right, the bread was good. Bring in the TV.
- No, don't. I don't want to leave the bread. - Put it right here. All right, that's the TV, go, go. All right Chris, we left the TV as a tip. - "Bread was good." - Smiley face. - We were never here.
- I'm taking this. - "The bread was good." I love it. - You did a good job with the waters and the bread and honestly-
- Thank you. - We can't get that kind
of service anywhere. Comment if you've ever
tipped a waitress at TV. - Let me know.
- Thanks, man. All right, you ready? - The water was spectacular. - All right, let's go, go, go, go, go. - Well thank you, I've
never had a PlayStation. Please come back any anytime. - Yeah. Pop the bad boy open. These are all $1 coins
and there's 300 of 'em. - Can I get you guys something to drink? - Can I get some water please?
- A water. we have 300 gold coins right here. - All right, let's go. - It's about $300.
- $300 worth. So congratulations.
- Appreciate it. - You were an awesome waitress and we enjoyed the water and the bread. - Subscribe to MrBeast. - Thank you. - Y'all still need a minute? - Yes ma'am, please.
- Yes? Okay. - Thank you, sirs, you have a great day. Here is your tip, here's your pen. So we're gonna be tipping a printer and you can't use a
printer without a laptop. - Of course. - And you can't use a laptop
without a PlayStation. - Makes sense to me. - And then we put that there. Congratulations. - I wasn't even supposed to work tonight. - All right, well thank you so much for your awesome
service, enjoy it. - Thank you.
- Yeah. - Thank you.
- You're welcome. - What's the item?
- Edible Arrangements. It was great water and it was
really hard to bring it out, so she should enjoy the
fruits of her labor. - Put it on the floor. - Whoops. Now we have to leave an actual tip. - That was an accident. To make up for spilling water, she's still gonna get her fruit basket but I think now we add $1000 because cleaning up water is worth $1000. - It's literally everywhere. - "Can we have a towel?" They're like "Here's a little hand rag." "Soz about spilling water." - Dude, people are gonna think we spilled this water on purpose. - $1000 and then enjoy the fruit. - All right, here, take
this, let's just leave. - Okay, and we're done. - They said "Take it."
- Are you serious? - "Enjoy the fruit." - So how do you feel about your tip? - I kinda wanna cry a little. - We feel really bad because
we spilled the water, so we gave you an extra thousand. - Thank you.
- Of course. - Subscribe to MrBeast. - Yeah, thank you.
- Thanks. - Hey, can I have a peanut
butter crunch smoothie? Guys, this smoothie is amazing. Give them everything we got. Enjoy it, thank you guys so much. - Subscribe.
- Subscribe to MrBeast. - Subscribe. - Ah, this is a refreshing water. You know it's fancier because
it came in a nice mason jar. - Yeah. "7 in gold, your tip." That was loud.
- It was. - Unnecessarily loud. - Gotta make a statement, boys. - All right. - Well, well, well. - That's a nice tip you got there. - That's quite a tip that I have, yeah. We bit it and everything,
I think it's real. - It's real.
- That is so amazing. I just wanted to say
thank you guys so much. - Can we have water?
- Yes and then I'll tell them to come out.
- All right. I guess we're sharing? - You know what, actually
because they gave us a water to share, that deserves some gold. They knew we love each other. - Our love is gold, just like this water. - "Sorry, no 10K just seven K in gold." - Would you like a sip?
- Was it good? - It was pretty good actually. - Mm. The aftertaste of your lips. Some goldy, a little nuggy. - Goldilocks. - A little nuggy goes right there. There you are, nuggy.
- Bye, nugget. I love you. - All right.
- Let's go. - Wait, what? It's not real. I have tables to serve, I can't cry. - How you feeling? - I don't really remember
how to do my job. - What are you getting? - I don't know yet. - Thank you, sir. Thank you for the PlayStation,
the laptop and the TV. You know, you want to play
PlayStation on your TV. - Yep.
- So there's the PlayStation. - All right, I think that covers it. - Thanks for the water, guys. - That's for just two things of water? - They really liked the
way you poured the water. - They didn't even see
me pour the water though. - For that, you get a
PS4, a laptop and a TV. - Wow, just for some water? Thank you guys, subscribe to MrBeast. - Yeah, no problem. - Hey dude, can you pull up a little bit? Can I give you something? Hey, this is worth $7,000, here you go. Thank you for giving people pizza. - $7,000, seriously.
- Don't throw that away. - Okay, thank you.
- It's real gold. - Okay, thank you.
- Yeah. What would you buy if you got seven grand? - Probably a better car. - That little thing in your
hand will buy you a car. - Thank you. - So that was our last gold bar. - It's okay, pizza boy is happy. We've been tipping waitresses all day but now I think it's time for
me to give my boys the tip. But they have to work for it. So I got the weirdest food I could find and I challenged them to eat it. So fermented soybeans. - It cooks itself by pretty much rotting. - Oh, cool. - For awhile.
- Is it healthy? Am I gonna get sick?
- It's edible. - Well, everything's edible but is- - Is everything edible? - I'm sitting this one
out, I'm not eating it. - This smells like armpits. - Don't eat my beans.
- He looks scared. - Oh. - If Chris don't like
it, I ain't eating it. - Oh, Chris is gone, guys.
- There's no chance. - $1,000, Chandler, if you eat it. - No.
- That's one grand. That's real bad.
- Yeah. - No, you wouldn't. - It tastes like if you opened someone's stomach and ate
what was in your stomach and the smell is even worse. Maybe I just had a bad piece, right? - Would you eat this for $1000? - Give it here.
- Two fork fulls? $1000 right here. - Oh. - Dude, I can smell Jake. - There you go.
- Oh my gosh. - All right, so this is
something we've had before. Chris, $1000? - What do I gotta do?
- Eat one. - The whole egg?
- Yeah. - Dude, you tagging out?
- I can't do that. - You tagging out?
- Come on, Zach. - Chandler's tapping out,
his brother's gonna do it. - Three, two, one. - Oh Garrett.
- No, no water. You have to swallow it. - You can have a little
bit of water, that's fine. - It won't go. - Garrett's about to throw up, stop. - Garrett, just throw up, dude. Garrett, just throw up.
- Just don't, dude. - Just don't.
- He's crying. He's crying.
- Let's go, Garrett! - Who's throwing up back there? You're not even eating. - Zach, Zach, Zach, Zach, Zach, Zach. He did it. - Ah, that was so bad. - See, this is all you have to do to make money is just eat weird food. Up next, we have octopus. - This guy right here?
- Yeah. - Right here, this guy right here? - This dude right here.
- Eat it. - This dude right here!
- Yeah. - The whole thing, put the whole thing in. - Wait, I didn't even have
to offer him money to eat it. - No, no, do the whole thing,
come on, the whole thing. You gotta put that whole
thing in there, come on. - I'm drooling.
- No, you're fine. Eat it.
- Here, do this. - Put more in. - You have to do the whole thing. Come on, come on.
- I need water. - Come on.
- No. - Come on.
- Just eat it. - Come on, you're good,
you're good, you're good. You're good, you're good. No, put it back in, put it back in. - Ew, it's on my shirt, it's on my shirt. We just want to give you money. - Then give it to me.
- Up next is fish eyes. Guys, I don't expect
you to actually eat this but if you did, you could get $1000. - Those eyes are gonna squirt
literally down your throat. Ooh, that one's got some green
stuff on it, you see that? - Lettuce, oh, I'm out. - Lettuce.
- Is this safe to eat? - Yeah.
- It's safe to eat? All right.
- Let's see. - Oh my gosh.
- Ugh. - Oh, you hear that?
- Ugh. - Is that the iris.
- All right. - Can I have the trash can ready? - A second.
- Oh! - It's looking at me. - I'm putting it in it next time and just. - Look at Chris. - Oh.
- Get him a trash can. Oh my god. - All right, I feel bad for Chris. Chris is not allowed to do this anymore. - Let's high five over him. - Yeah.
- Yeah, he threw up. - You get the money no
matter what, I feel bad. - It squirted in my throat. I swallowed it whole and my
throat contracted and popped it and all of the juice from the
eye just went into my throat. Oh man, that's probably the
worst thing I've ever done. - $5,000, Chandler. - Got our mascot, here we go.
- If you eat all of this. - All of it?
- $5,000. - You gotta do it.
- Pickles. - Chandler, come on.
- It's some pickles. - You can rely on me. - Five grand. - What could you buy with
five grand, Chandler? - A coffin.
- Hold on, hold on. - I need silence. - All right, here we go.
- All right, everybody shh. - Five grand.
- Cucumber, cucumber. - You could literally buy a car. - Is that how you go through it? - We can't make it too easy. - Who wants to be a millionaire? - Here we go, oh, oh, it's
in there, it's in there. - Come on, come on.
- It's in there. - You're good, you're good.
- Come on. - No, no, no, don't spit, don't spit. No Chandler, no. - Don't think about it.
- Oh no. - Swallow. Swallow. You're chewing too much, swallow. - And now you only have eight more to go. - You did one.
- That was hard. - But you did one and it was no problem. You got seven more.
- All right. - Oh, another one.
- Swallow. - Before this hits two minutes. - Swallow quick.
- Two minutes? - He has until this hits two minutes. - Just swallow quick.
- Two minutes, okay. There you go, next one. - Hey, that was 10 seconds. You got this.
- Fight it, fight it. - That was big.
- That was just 10 seconds though, you got it. - Hey Chandler, you got a message. "If Chandler eats these pickles, I'm gonna give him five grand." He only has a minute left
and he's refusing to eat 'em. - Chandler, come on man. - Chandler, do it.
- Like a pill, it's a pill. - Chandler, come on.
- Swallow it whole. - 40 seconds.
- Go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Keep going.
- Come on. - Keep going, keep going.
- Eat the next one. Oh, oh. - Come on, you got it.
- Whoa, whoa. - Get the trash can.
- Oh no, no, okay. It's happening. - These pills are too big. Go, go, go, go. - Come on, man.
- He, he has 20 seconds. Ope, he tapped out.
- No. - What do you think?
- Call me next time you want something nasty
to be eaten, I'll do it. - Okay. So yeah, we gave waitresses
a bunch of money. We ate a lot of weird food, that's that. Go install Honey because they're the ones who
gave me all this money. I have octopus juice on my
neck and I'll see you later. ♪ MrBeast6000 ♪ ♪ Oh, whoa ♪ ♪ MrBeast6000, yeah, you know his name ♪ ♪ He changed it once or twice
