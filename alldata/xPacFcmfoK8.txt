so hi and welcome to a sponsor interview for mini c plus and today as a guest i have alessandro from flowtraders hi who is going to give us an overview about what flow traders is and what they do with c plus plus today and with um last year's conference i just thought it'd be a nice option if some of the sponsors want to just come on and you know give a short interview or just a short introduction of who they are and today as the first sponsor we host um flow traders so hello and welcome alessandro thank you i'm very happy to be here and today i want to talk with you essentially why i like for traders why i work for protraders and what are my personal preference when is about choosing a company and what are my my reasons for which i work for flow traders let's start with a short introduction i'm alessandro a c plus plus software engineer i've been a c plus plus soft energy engineer now for something like seven years and in the last couple of years i focused my attention a bit more in training fresh graduates out of from out of the university let's try to understand who is float traders we are a proprietary trading firm this means that we trade with our own money and we do not have clients we are specialized in etp that are exchange threaded product technology is very important for us because we are a low latency trading firm and now i really would like to move in actually what we do and why personally i really like to be inflow traders there are three million three main reasons for that the first one is of course the technology and how we use our technology okay so that is what flow traders is and now we're going to focus on what flow traders is with c plus plus um can you tell a bit of us about how it is to work for flow traders yeah sure so if we want to focus on the c plus plus side i think that the most outstanding part is that you're going to work with a lot of very expert people that knows a lot about the technology that you're using and they actively like and enjoy the technology that they're using if i have to think about my personal experience when i moved in flow i was actually definitely much less skilled than now and they helped me in growing they helped me in they literally taught me how a modern c developer should think and should write his code and um if we go into 2020 and just get the whole pandemic how was experience to work for flow traders in in that phase for you yeah so 2020 i think that was a very interesting year for us because a lot of things changed as for everyone and flo understand how he's challenging working from home not having your colleagues around uh not having not having your uh your standard routine around you so one of the things that they actually put a lot of effort in was to make our our time a bit nicer and have done that with maybe small gifts or small events organized online and probably one of the thing that was the best in my opinion one of the small gift that was the nicest during this year was a small girl flower the descendants was not for this is not nice for the bouquet of flower itself but because in that very period that very moment uh on the news was possible to read how the local flower market flower farmer actually had some trouble uh and it's very nice how flow has done essentially as spend some money in helping them at the same time helping us in being a bit happier during this period yeah that's that's really nice yeah um so you talked about your personal goals and how you you know work with flow traders and how flow traders helps you to reach your goals um can you go a bit more into depth on this yeah so i think that one of um one probably the main reason for which i still working for flow and i see myself working for for a long time is that flow allows me to evolve myself so and evolve essentially every every person who works for flow when i joined i really knew very little compared to now it made me the software engineer that i am now and they helped me in in shape my my path and my my career around my wishes i think it is something very important and i think this is something that maybe does not happen very often and does not happen everywhere uh for example if i have to think about how what they've done for me i started as a software engineer then i started to be a mentor for our graduate program uh they really saw how much uh effort and energy i put in it and how much i enjoyed it and i was able starting from there to evolve as the coordinator of the of of the graduate program so they see your your potential they see what you like to do and they try to help you in matching these two things and i think it is just very nice to have an environment like that around sounds good yes um now we heard a bit about working at flow traders and now we're going to be talking about a bit about c plus plus with alessandro and i already asked you like you know how flow traders was as a employer during their pandemic and i see you're not in the office so you're all able to work on the home office mostly i think yeah this was actually not an option before because flow really believes in working together and working as a team and as soon everything started they actually put a lot of effort in creating a setup using vdis and vpns to allow us to work from home yeah uh this was in my opinion an impressive effort done in a very short time because so one day we know that we were able to work from home yeah okay um can you tell me a bit about what is the hiring process at flow traders the hiring process actually can be a bit different accordingly to your technical skill it can be slightly different if you are for example a graduate or if you are a senior software developer but overall it's roughly the same you start with an introduction to the company so the recruiter will actually call you and you can discuss with the recruiter about what we do and what kind of profile we're looking for after that we will send you a test usually it is an accurate test so he needs maybe a bit of preparation because it's not exactly what usually we do on a regular basis but is a good way to understand if the candidate knows how to program after that there is a first face-to-face interview where face to face in this moment means uh essentially on on camera and during this first interview there are some discussion that are a bit more focused on your background your technical skills what what is your experience and there are some challenges to solve usually some whiteboard problems after the whiteboard there is actually the last step of the interview process and usually we actually we fly you to the office in this moment is not an option because of covet and during this during this last interview this last technical interview uh the focus is on your c plus plus knowledge and on the knowledge of the technology that you use and we really try to understand if you know what you're talking about this is what we want to see we want to see a person that uh really understand what that what what he does or she does uh and he's really passionate about what is happening so you're you're not only focused on like if if you know the answer is correct but also like how it's being expressed and how people are reacting to certain environments and problems that's what you're interested in definitely another percent and one thing that maybe happened actually once for real in um in an interview there was a guy who was claiming how he liked the hardware a lot and being low level with the hardware so of course then the natural question for example would be okay then how this particular thing works in the cpu or i don't know what is the size of the cache or the cpu so every everything that you like then we try to understand uh how much you like it and try to feature as best as possible in our in our landscape essentially yeah that's that's kind of my next question um what what is the usage of c plus plus at flow traders what is the problems you solve yeah and the tools to use for this so mainly we do only low latency application in c plus plus because there is a simple there is there is essentially a simple a simple reason for that if you use other languages such as i don't know java or python you can be you can develop something in a much shorter time so build uh c plus plus software is expensive because of that we really try to focus our our c plus plus usage only when low latency is required for a developer point of view i think this is very interesting because this means that whatever you're going to do in c plus plus will be technically challenging because it's not just infrastructure it's not infrastructure code it's something that you have to build for latency you have to build for our traders of our specific requirements you have actually a lot of freedom in choosing your own environment uh you're free to choose if you want to work with an ide or if you want to work with bim actually we have both i personally prefer work with ideas but there are a lot of people who still who like to use bi uh you're free to use uh almost every tool that you like or that you want to use we are quite flexible from this point of view so flow traders is like you know accommodating you to choose how to work on their code yeah correct essentially you are the administrator of your own local machine you can install all the tools that you want the tools that are available in our repository of course you cannot grab something from internet and install it uh but there is a lot there are a lot of tools so you're really free to to shape your own environment accordingly to how you used to work or how you like to work what c plus plus standards are you using on your code base commonly yeah we are using c plus plus 17 we are already thinking on how to move to c plus plus 20. the transition will require quite a bit of work on our side for both the compilation side and production environment so i do not expect to happen immediately but i really hope that in a year from now we will be fully c plus plus 20. okay and can can you say about like what compilers do you use or is that specific uh okay we usually compile with two compilers we compile with gcc and with c-lang our production compiler is gcc and silang we use slang mainly because in some cases the wordings that the compiler can provide us and the errors are actually more meaningful that errors that gcc provide us yeah so yeah it's more a kind of diagnostic tool for us more than production tool at least at the moment i know that you know clang has some features like checking for arrows and sanitizers which yeah i would definitely use them we definitely use uh something from silence okay we use actually other sanitizer i think that actually made it automatic few a while ago together with it we can use um silent tidy but our official tool for checking bugs code style and so on is actually sonarqube that has been integrated in our continuous integration system okay about the tools i think that one thing that is very important we do we try to do a lot is actually to check our memory constantly using tools such as valgrind because it adds a lot of insight and can prevent a lot of problems in production so your code base is very modern uses a modern standard and sounds like really interesting as a workplace yeah and let me finish with the last question i know you have been at me c plus plus a few times and just you know how was your experience from being there as a sponsor okay was an experience let's start with that uh i would say that was very nice to be there to meet a lot of smart people and to see how the civil trust community is actually evolving and who are the people behind this class community uh because most of the time uh you have i don't know this concept of this concept of the community and it's kind of vague but then when you see the people when you see who they are when you talk with them when you experience with that when you share ideas with them uh i think that this is very engaging so yeah this is this is how i would define my experience in meeting c plus plus it was an engaging conference with a full of very smart people yeah that's kind of our goal to to make people really meet and meeting zippers plus and i'm looking forward to be back in berlin again very likely next year and i'm thinking about making this year's edition and fall again an online edition because it's just too difficult to plan ahead for this year how this pandemic evolves with that i just want to thank you for coming on and having the courage to to talk about flow traders your company and i know the trading sector is always very secretive about their secrets and so just thank you for coming on and thank you for supporting me c plus in the last years and the previous years and um does that any final words yeah honestly i want to thank you for all uh knowledge that your conference allowed us to acquire i think this is very nice
