stan lee is promoting nfts now which might surprise you because stan lee is dead but his official twitter account begs to differ quote from championing diversity to embracing new tech stan was always one step ahead of the curve to honor his innovative spirit stan's first indian hero chakra the invincible debuts in his own nft digital art collection and then we have a link here now listen to take a dead man and use him to prop up your garbage profile picture nft collection might seem bad but i promise you it gets way worse starting with the art which features stan lee smiling from beyond the grave an alien version of his superhero for no other reason than to prop up this 6000 profile picture collection i mean the crazy thing is they try to make this sound like by buying this you're honoring stan's legacy somehow check out this trash honoring what would have been stan's 99th birthday on december 28th we are inviting all of stan's fans to celebrate his amazing legacy with us by sharing ownership in a limited nft collectible around one of his first international superheroes wow they're saying hey if you want to celebrate this guy's um what would have been his birthday just reminding you that he's dead buy our stuff and if you're wondering how this is honoring stan lee's legacy in any way um you're not the only one the website who created this seems to have popped up after stan lee was dead like they weren't even around when he was alive the company so it seems like uh you know after the body was cold these guys had their little idea for an nft collection to put together and i say that because it's not like stan lee had been a collaborator on this nft project and like died while signing digitally the last nft that was not the case i want to make that really clear this is not like when a musician releases music after they die that they weren't able to finish i mean that's already a little bit weird but no this is like hey you died some dudes come around try to find a way to make money with your stuff and just drop nfts and use your twitter profile to promote it i mean this thing is so bad all around that pretty much everyone agreed this was pretty trash dull and dark can't believe stan lee came back from the dead just to promote an nft schlatt said that's the power of blockchain jacksepticeye this is so awful and then we have this meme but there's one other detail here that i think most people missed which is that the name of the nft platform they're selling these nfts on will blow your mind you can't make this up the name of the nft platform that is bringing back stan lee from beyond the grave to sell these crappy nfts is called beyond life dot club i kid you not watch this is their thing an exclusive uh you know nft collection from beyond i thought they're gonna say from beyond the grave from beyond human possibilities launching soon only at beyond life dot club guys stan lee has officially entered the beyond life dot club this is such a travesty such a gross desecration of this man's life you know i just think it's gross not only because he never promoted these nfts but also because this the whole thing could turn out to be a scam only a couple of weeks ago they were saying that people were having trouble withdrawing from this platform the platform that they're selling these things on so this could absolutely become an a total scam either way it's one of the grossest things i've seen in a while taking one of the most all-time beloved figures taking their twitter account from beyond the grave and using it to shill a quick cash grab on your website beyond life dot club all in the name of their 99th birthday completely gross one of the most disgusting things i've seen and i hope people don't buy this that's all i wanted to say bye
