you ever get a gift that's kind of a burden on my recent trip to Micron they allowed me to build my own Ram to put in my gaming PC unfortunately it's ddr5 which means I'm gonna have to upgrade but because I don't exactly play the same games that we use to review products the only way for me to know which way to go team blue or team red is to build the very best of Intel and the very best of AMD and drag race them against each other in popular games like Anno 1800 and Untitled Goose game what a jerk with AMD and Intel so close in performance these days it could go either way and With No Holds Barred there's only one rule that you have to hear this message from our sponsor simplemdm simple MDM is ridiculously simple Apple device management for it enrolling your company's Apple devices and keeping them up to date doesn't have to be frustrating try it for 30 days for free on unlimited devices at simplemdm.com LTT [Music] right out of the gate we got to figure out who's building AMD and who's building Intel which do you want to build I want to build Intel but I'm guessing you're going to flip it on me and make me build AMD okay well rock paper scissors you when you build Intel you lose you build AMD paper scissors I forgot I'm sorry well then I I win you default yeah okay fine one one okay rock paper scissors I forget which one of the building I don't know you should uh oh you lost I lost so you're building AMD why don't you want to build AMD what's wrong with AMD it's their first time going LGA and I'm sure that's perfectly fine yeah but I've never built an LGA AMD system I forgot you've never owned an AMD system I owned a Phenom like ages ago when I was in high school but I bought a pre-built to make this challenge as Fair as possible we've gone out of our way to completely isolate the CPU as our variable that means that a everything about these systems is as similar as possible GPU power supply even Cooling and second we've gone really high end like almost every one of these components is in a different performance class than what I would put in my own system super Overkill the one exception is the case we've actually chosen corsair's 5000d airflow which is a pretty reasonably priced 175 dollar mid Tower and the reason for that is that it's just really well designed we didn't want to have cooling be an issue because in the final deployment in my server rack it's not going to be there is one difference that you guys might call us on our Intel System is using a slightly lower tier motherboard than our AMD system but Labs assures us that the performance between the Maximus z790 hero and extreme is identical unless maybe you were putting it under liquid nitrogen for extreme overclocking and then another difference for our awesome AMD Crosshair extreme is we get a bunch of onboard Gen 5 drives with the Intel one I'm sorry you're gonna have to use an add-in card we've also got better land pleb I know we've got better land on this too it's got 10 gig and two and a half gig well that doesn't really matter because I can just put a 10 gig network card oh wait high-end motherboards don't have any pcie slots anymore we've got three what happened what is this trend you've got three you've got one for your graphics card you've got one for your pcie Gen 5 drive this is my graphics card one to be covered by my stupid graphics card and then one more well you're not going to use a 40 90 though right no I'm going to stick with my 30 90 and it's water cooled so it's actually not going to be you can probably do that and then you gotta room for a network card so you're okay uh I uh mine will be completely full yeah you'll live the dream that a lot of people want to experience of filling out their motherboard slots what kind of dreams do you have surgery and fill all the slots it feels great can you imagine Mommy I had a dream last night I put I filled all the pcie slots in my computer on the Intel side of things I'm going to be running the core I9 13900k a 24 core consumer platform motherboard if you told me about this thing like three four years ago I'd have said you were freaking nuts but it also isn't quite what it sounds eight of those cores are high performance P cores while 16 of them are high efficiency e-course what this means in practice though since almost no games are designed for more than a course is that it's a gaming Beast while also having a pretty good amount of grunt for Creative tasks like competitive cinebench running meanwhile in team red I've got a 7950x I may only have 16 cores but each one hey each of mine each of mine is stronger than yours I don't need efficiency cores I don't have to cheat to get the bigger number I'm just pumping straight power into this thing then why didn't you want to build the AMD one that's a good point I actually really like the way their cool new CPU looks with the weird uh IHS on top with the cutouts it looks cooler my CPU looks cooler than yours the best part of choosing your teams arbitrarily with rock paper scissors is like the trash talk that totally means nothing I know I'm not taking this nice poor people CPU I'm a Loser yeah actually you've got the poor people CPU mine's more expensive this thing's like 690 dollars yours is like 6 30. look that extra 60 bucks okay again in the spirit of completely removing bottlenecks this is a fifteen hundred dollar m.2 drive not the kind of thing I would recommend for the average gaming PC we're going to be using the sabrin rocket 4 plus in its eight terabyte configuration that's right ladies and gentlemen up to 7 000 megabytes a second read six thousand megabytes a second rights pcie Gen 4 and enough space to hold all but the most excessive of Humble Bundle enhanced Steam libraries how'd you get your cover off uh with a screwdriver oh my God it's all down here yeah yeah I know that's why it's a thousand dollar money board what is this thing oh um no wonder I don't understand it's for young people yeah gen Z for cooling we've gone with the h-150i elite capellix from Corsair this is a triple 120 millimeter AIO which means compared to my custom loop at home it's not quite on par but this is enough to handle either of these CPUs at full turbo indefinitely so this will give us a best case scenario for performance wait are you getting ahead of me over there no what are you doing I'm I have to put the stand ups on oh wow building on Intel is so fast and convenient my standoffs are already in okay don't to be clear that's actually not the case that's only because Nick from Logistics put this together better for me oh and I've got to change the you knew that one was going to be plus yeah we gotta change the bracket and everything we colluded all right do not modify not modified oh man it says old on it you got the old what is that I don't know you get the old garbage one say old box on you my why do you have that I don't have the old ones man these are heavy who's putting these stickers on our graphics card probably Gary what am I gonna need I'm gonna need three oh my God three slots this is ridiculous huge what is there to say about the RTX 4090 it's really expensive but it's fast so if we want to know what the fastest CPU is we've got to put the fastest GPU in even if I don't end up upgrading to it which I won't I have committed as of today even if Nvidia sends me one of these for free I will not put it in my computer so long that my USB cable gets in the way and I don't want to bend that like at all all right who needed any other pcie slots anyway boom I could technically put something in here but it would sit right in front of my intake fans which would be a big brain move with a 40 90. big brain now let's talk about powering this thing there's been a lot of discussion around whether it's the adapters or whether it's the spec of the connector or whatever else the case may be what we all agree on is that you want as Little Bend in this cable as possible so I think I can close the panel that looks pretty good oh right and I guess now's a good time to talk about our power supply we chose the prime TX 1300 from see Sonic why because it's the best 80 plus titanium 1300 Watts support for the latest 12-pin pcie connectors what more could you possibly want you get two of those connectors you get two of them in the box and you get it for SLI you get a Gantry no it's for when the 50 90 comes out and you need two of those to deliver 1200 watts floor time oh I found an old GPU uh Voodoo uh that you could plug into the wall God we're gonna go time's a flat circle I found some on eBay for like 300 bucks or something like that okay fine so cool buying 300 E-Waste now yeah this is my life now that we've reached system memory we're at a bit of a Crossroads we can either each go ahead with the most optimal kit for our respective platforms so I've got a 6800 Mega transfer per second kit from G skill while I've got a 6 000 Mega transfer per second kit but with lower latency right I've got 30 CL 30 you're at cl34 I think all right or because I'm going to be using this memory that I made myself at Micron we could both go ahead with this I think we should use this stuff it's really cool and that's what you're going to be using anyway right like that's what you're going to put in your personal rig so it doesn't matter what either of these expect for because that's what you're going to use but in the spirit of telling the people which one's the fastest in these weird games in one place Fair all right we go with this with the labs verified stuff okay hello buddy you in there yeah you're in there ddr5 likes to go in the slot like that no problem it's happy one concern we might actually blow the breaker trying to run these two machines here on the table like this no you might have to grab power from somewhere else the 4090s ploof it's only like 500 watts on the d450 yeah yeah it takes like a thousand of low breaker 1500. computers David says 1500 we're good now all we need is to close up the panel and through the miracle of movie Magic everything is set up we're done our bioses are updated we've got the latest drivers we've got XMP and Expo enabled for the best possible performance with our Ram kits and we even downloaded some of the games that I wanted to test thankfully uh CS go just finished you know I'm gonna take up professional CS go so I need to make sure I get up what you got something to say AMD boy I I can't be a professional CS go player and what and what and what just saying it's a lot of time you don't have time to go be a professional CS go player nice recovery yeah nice recovery yeah I was gonna say I'll say it everywhere of course the most important game yeah stop downloading rocket League the how big is your penis game okay it's off already sick oh wait you've she started already yeah it starts that doesn't even matter because I'm gonna have the highest number in temperatures maybe I'm already getting up there 89.90c basically well I'm at 78. yeah come on bring it on pulling 235 Watts wait are you serious my CPU is not going to get as hot as yours uncool Intel literally uncool uh 38 784 37 392. yes I send a bench faster now technically for a full 10 minute run AMD will do a little better it'll get like 300 more points in a multi-threaded workload but it's really close okay what do you want to start with well you want to play Counter-Strike Survival Let's play Counter-Strike fine let's play Counter-Strike CS go server D does too let's go okay all right there we go join game problem solved two thousand uh it says there's a requires a password what do you mean and my mouse is gone now what what are you talking about look can you see my mouse and it says requires passwords it must be because of AMD I can't even cancel you know what it's it's the connect commands you have the server browser up in front of it I call CT the worst part is my Mouse is gone now yeah well you should have thought of that I know you were trying to Red to the team red more like team dead and I can't talk to F4 because it's a steam game so they use the stupid like alt F10 or whatever it is so I'm just gonna force close oh what FPS you get 395 395 FPS at 4K 400. let's go let's go GPU 240 260 Watts it's like nothing surprisingly actually no my GPU oh my God my client needs to update online it's a waste of time literally any other day we should do this well no no this is not hard we just have to do it it's not but it's taking too much time we heard it in a game you're in the game wait we're going to need to be able to go into the same game later anyway so we might as well solve it why is Chrome not on these okay the next time I walk up to a computer and only edges on it I'm going to lose my all right how many kills you got uh 35. what What's your FPS though uh oh yeah I'm getting like 360 390 it fluctuates a lot but you know we're hitting 100. no don't wait I got this guy oh come on yeah yours is dipping down to like 338 oh 282 yeah you're a little ahead oh my God that was awful please editor do not show what just happened there so I'm like 360 three 350. you know what I'm a little ahead I think it fluctuates I'm a little ahead I don't know if oh someone I got a shotgun so I'm not a lot of use at this range um it fluctuates a lot it's so close I don't think it matters by the way you're dead wow that's how it gets me by cheating isn't that great the fact that we can be like into AMD oh yeah and don't be wrong and idiots yeah they're both really good I love it yeah I love it that's what real competition will do for you La Fortune no he's a pirate so that sounds awesome why don't you want to play his jeans no that's not the point the point is he's an NPC yo why can't he plays a pirate though why can't I start I don't know some additional content is enabled which not all players own yes the DLC for this game is really good okay so uh you're gonna want to go wait what why you go why you go move everything around like that hold it just okay just just chill for a second okay did you man did you change the you changed the angle I just scrolled out and then I started moving things Nicholas ploof how on Earth are we supposed to look at the same thing now so where do I go oh my God why can't I here what is w what did you just I just pressed W okay do your thing wow this is a dead heat yeah 78 77 literally within one FPS yeah and it's fluctuating like I I've seen mine stick at 79 but yours was up yeah 78. what's up and again 113 120 honestly yeah it might be AMD not by a ton I think it's AMD you're definitely winning in 90 in in minimums as well to be clear both of us are getting over 100 FPS average in an RTS game which is fine everything's cranked to ultra yeah 4K like this is overkill like look how busy these cities are when you turn up all the details it's kind of wild actually how much is going on Halo Halo Halo okay we happen to be looking at exactly the same things right now my God it's close it's like 5 FPS difference but you're winning in both average and 99 percent I would never be able to tell the difference between these I want to say uh Intel is doing ever so slightly better it's a narrow win but it's a win yeah very narrow slightly an Intel's favor how on Earth are we gonna make a decision here that's your decision it's your computer playing actual games like experiencing it there is functionally no difference no they both feel great um the only real difference is probably the price mine's cheaper yours is cheaper the motherboards can be about the same price but your your CPU is like fifty dollars cheaper I mean that's not much man it's not much it's honestly not and the the ram is pretty similar you're gonna put the Micron in for Black Friday my CPU is on promo for six hundred dollars mine's more than that 6.99 it's on sale for by Two Dollars Dollar 25 and you can get a combo with a motherboard buy one by default then for rental my CPU is cheaper okay fine yeah I mean it's and it's significantly cheaper it's like 100 yeah it's over 50 bucks that's uh that's enough and you get a second generation ddr5 memory controller what timeline is this maybe it's time to go back I'm going back to Intel let's go wait wait wait hold the phone AMD is coming in hot with the price Cuts over the weekend they dropped the 7950x from 700 all the way down to 575 making things even worse for Intel at least in this race they're probably pretty happy with the sales the 13900k is now out of stock at that lower price of 625 so even if you could get it for that much AMD is still 50 bucks lower AMD then yeah seems like a no-brainer to me just like this segue to our sponsor has no brain in it if I don't believe that a sponsor MSI the holidays are coming quickly but MSI has you covered for gifts this year msi's holiday deals are on now where you can save on their 12th gen
