ladies and gentlemen welcome back to the Women's World Chess Championship Match in 2023 this is contested by Juan Jun the incumbent champion from China and lei Ting jie the Challenger also from China in today's recap I'm going to show you Games 3 4 and 5. there's also a doggie in the background who began licking himself now that this recap has started he's extremely excited but that is very inappropriate let's jump into the games we had a very very very big result today which shakes up the match uh the first two games ended in draws that's what happens in top level competition uh very frequently including at the world's just Championship level now lateing GS started this match with the move E4 this is her second game with white so she played a game with white she played a game with black now she's playing with white again and we have the exact same thing we had in the very first game uh made a recap about that a few days ago but in that game uh latexia castled in this position this is the Berlin defense and it hits the pawn in the center and white can allow it to be captured but in this game she plays D3 this is very simple this is called the ante Berlin I actually called this in the first game uh in the first game of the match in this position I said I think that the Castle's move which was played in game one was a filler move I think that later did not want to spoil the rest of her preparation now that she knows it's like poker now that she knows some info about her opponent's repertoire she comes back in game two and she plays D3 black plays Bishop C5 now there are a handful of lines all of this is explored at top level constantly white can play Bishop C6 white can play castles white can play Knight D2 in this game white plays the move C3 uh also I didn't really cover the format so if you didn't watch the first recap it's a best of 12. that's that's very common the I think the other world just championship match was best of 14 but uh for reasons that we are not going to dive into in this recap and I probably will make a separate video on men's and women's format or rather open in women's format in chess they have differences all right don't shoot the messenger I will get into all that but not in today's video Bishop to G5 played uh by late teens yeah this is a very aggressive move uh it's a very aggressive move because after black plays the move D6 really the only way to get rid of this pin is to play H6 and G5 or just accept that the pin exists Knight bd2 black plays the move A6 and late things yet for a second game in a row has a very pleasant position uh from the opening with the white pieces and now she plays D4 which is the entire purpose of playing the move C3 she plays the move d4 uh in this position she she like the bishop is committed here so taking makes a lot of sense um now this and the bishop stands back and applies pressure to the center and now White Castle so White's got a very nice Center supported by the knights this is all very nice you may ask why white didn't play E5 because this move simply looks like it should win the night that's because Queen D3 and that's a problem because if you take the Knight you actually just get brutalized Bishop E3 Bishop takes it's yeah it's not good Bishop A5 Bishop A6 Bishop F5 Bishop D3 very very nasty stuff uh so White Castles before engaging in the battle and goes like this and plays Queen C2 visually White's position is uh is very very nice lady has a very pleasant position um black plays Knight takes E4 though and this is the beginning of an explosion Knight takes E4 shreds open the position and now white will recapture with the Knight excuse me after white takes with the Knight black is not going to recapture because that will result in the loss of material instead black plays the move Bishop to F5 pinning and Juan Jun is very close to solving all of her opening problems and in fact almost taking over control of the game uh because she's simply going to be better she's going to play this this is going to be open she's going to have the bishop pair the bishop looks like I can't draw arrows that's okay but white plays Knight E5 and white is going to lose the Knight but white is going to get C6 Bishop takes Queen C3 and it's very difficult in fact impossible to protect the pawn on C6 black goes here and white can just go back and try to win the pawn on C6 but uh instead of that uh she just does this and she's just not in a rush black plays rookie six she plays King H1 and kicks out the bishop and still hasn't taken the pawn on C6 and now plays A4 to control Black's position black starts firing with H5 likes like all right you don't want my Pawn no problem I'm gonna create some problems for you Bishop F2 rookie 8 but slowly this is unraveling I mean throughout this game white has had an opportunity to potentially take on C6 Knight E5 makes a lot of sense uh you could have tried to take on C6 a little bit later but it was it was a little challenging because if you do this D4 is hanging so that's why Lake Ting Jia did this then black went here so you can't actually take because your Bishop is hanging right now you can't take it all Rooks you could try to play Rook C1 it's gonna happen at some point maybe but it doesn't black plays C5 the thing is for the second game in a row latex with the white pieces is a pawn down but is controlling black she's just not letting Joo and June get a pleasant position tries to break out we have takes we have a queen trade and all the pieces fly off the board for a second time that we've seen since the first recap Rooks and Bishop endgame opposite colors uh and uh White is only creating Chances with an outside pass Pawn but it's just not fast enough and Rook A2 Rook D2 they dance okay four just no progress to be made if you try to infiltrate I always have side checks your king can't go forward if the King goes to F4 for example I just play Rook A4 I also can play Bishop E2 and that's mate so you have to protect yourself or try to escape into the territory three draws yes a little bit boring but that's what world championship matches are all about I told you there's going to be a big result in today's video in game number four June begins with D4 uh and for a second game in a row uh we have this and now D takes C4 that's a surprising move that is a surprising move from late India let me explain uh in game number one we had a semi-tarash right and we had a totally symmetrical position like this um DC is like not played a lot at Grand Master Level nowadays because of the move E4 uh White just tries to get the entire Center the Vienna this is yes there's another opening called the Vienna uh is uh very dangerous for black black uh frequently will be a pawn up but white gets very good attacking Chances with the Queen the bishop and I can't draw arrows but later plays B5 recently this move has surged in popularity and it's really hard for white to actually prove an advantage the point is you give up the pawn but you take this and then you develop with Bishop before Bishop B7 castles and life is good so the critical move against B5 is E5 then you take on B5 so you don't lose this pawn and frequently you will even lose this Pawn for now you won't but frequently you will Knight C6 Bishop E7 black castles and white comes back with the ninth so that it doesn't get hit with a rook a pawn or a bishop and essentially this is the opening that black is saying like I'm not any worse and top level analysis has somehow proven that black is in fact able to take on C4 and play B5 it's crazy but you know that's modern engine analysis black just completely leaves the pawn on C4 and in many cases white doesn't even want to win it because winning it is difficult you might hang this and there's other ways of course as well uh B3 though take take and now this is really the beginning of the game white has a nice wedge black has good control of D5 in the future light squares white has attacking possibilities because black doesn't actually have the traditional Knight so Queen B1 and opportunities to attack the king over here Lansing templates night before opening up the bishop seizing control of the D5 Square Knight E4 and now black plays H6 black has not spent a second she is playing a 90 minute game of chess and she has 95 minutes just in thought why does the one thinking she's been she spent some 20 minutes thus far you'll also notice that the move Knight before actually loses a pawn Rook A7 is just a free Pawn that's because black is completely fine Black's position is in fact so good that losing the A7 Pawn but counter-attacking B3 is stronger and the blockade in the center is stronger and black will play C5 in the future so the C Pawn will disappear from weakness and there's no way to create an attack Knight G5 gets taken H4 just I mean I'll play H6 or I'll take the pawn um so Knight E4 the pawn has been captured and black plays Knight E5 she's still not thinking white plays Bishop to D2 black plays Knight C6 she's still not thinking Rook A1 now the other night before she's not even a repeating moves she's dancing with the Knights Bishop E3 she goes back to D5 and white plays Bishop C1 Jew and June in this position could have repeated moo she could have called it a day she could have been like you know what I got nothing let's make a draw but a bing but a boom terrific no Bishop C1 black counter attacks on the a file the first time in the game that Lei Ting J thought was 20 moons of the game ridiculous Rook D1 Why by the way is white not any better one two three four five six versus one two three four five that's a one Pawn Advantage Black's position is so good it doesn't even matter that black is down a pawn that's saying a lot that is saying a lot Rook A1 takes and just the Knight goes back to B4 white just can't do anything white just can't do anything the only chance that white asses to pop is to probably put the Knight on C5 and after Rook A8 Rook D1 white black did not even have to take on A1 Black could have played Knight C before and just stood there and tried to fight on the a file with the rook and the Queen but the way this happens now Juan Jun gets a little something little something Bishop C6 Bishop D2 and now White's advantages off of like the defibrillator has been activated right Queen A5 but black just brings all the pieces it looks like white has made some progress because it's 0.2 Advantage but she's down 40 minutes on the clock she could not move a single pawn and frankly she can't even move these pieces that gets taken every one of these moves gets taken taken Bishop C4 just doesn't do anything like if you play Bishop C4 you haven't impressed anybody um and if you take you're a lunatic because you've just lost the bishop and you've made no improvements to the position so black gold Play Bishop C6 and bring a rook here so Rook C1 and black even in fact trades the Queens and invites the Knight into the position but just Bishop B7 but Jew and June is is is doing her best she's doing her best G5 later strikes Jew and June down to 17 minutes on the clock to make her 40th move she now has 10 moves to make um Benji hi what do you think of the recap are you enjoying communion [Music] intermission yes yes up come here come here oh he's he's not all right hey maybe he'll come up later in the recap Knight F4 Bishop takes Pawn takes and my friends I'm not gonna spoil too much but the rest of this game is essentially more of the same it's white being upon up but being unable to deal with the activity of Black's pieces look and black wins the pawn back and now black has the B Pawn as well to potentially March forward black is still a pawn down Black's been down upon the whole game but the advantage has never been much uh Jew and Judas is doing her best but it goes to another opposite colored Bishop end game pawns are gonna fly off the board Rooks are gonna fly off the board and uh it was tense for a while but and probably the biggest Advantage was like 0.3 but there's just no way if you play E7 I just play Bishop F4 check and then I bring my king I can also check and uh yeah there's um I gotta be a little careful checking actually Bishop H5 so probably it's more just like for instance King C2 Rook C3 King B2 Rook E3 this is the way I would do it if I bring my king I actually lose because I get checked you gotta be a little careful can't be like Gotham making the Recaps but game four ends in a draw which means somebody won game five all right that's what that means a big fifth game which actually just finished a couple of hours ago here on uh July 11th here we go this time later goes for an Italian she was unsatisfied with how the Rue Lopez was going so she plays an Italian to avoid the Berlin Auntie Berlin doesn't really matter blackplay's Knight F6 white plays D3 this is called the Joko uh pianissimo with C3 D3 uh nobody's playing the Traxler or the fried liver at that level unfortunate by the way they really are missing out um and the entire uh concept here is a slow and steady build up sometimes the pawns on the Kings and the queen Side Dance sometimes the night dances out this way sometimes white creates an attack other times white brings the bishop around black tries to play for D5 or this so we're gonna see rookie one Bishop A7 and as we see it's a it's a very slow maneuvering game and white plays D4 so white plays in a way where uh they do not do any slow maneuvering white attacks the center and black has to do something or D5 is coming so black takes uh and white plays with the Knight Pawn takes looks possible but Knight B4 is a problem and you don't have a convenient way like if you're for instance uh uh just a very arbitrarily like if this was the position Knight B4 wouldn't do much because you have Bishop B1 and then A3 and then mate in the future but in this case you have to take with the Knight the bishop goes back to D7 and this is kind of like the the tense moment in the middle game Knight to E5 trying to go to C4 white plays Knight D2 developing and preventing Knight C4 a very tense game C5 a big decision you are now putting three pawns on dark squares and potentially drastically weakening the light squares and blocking out your Bishop Knight F5 is the best move but there's nothing wrong with Knight F3 Bishop C6 and it's kind of obvious that maybe Zhu and June wants to open up with her Bishops here Knight E5 de5 though is going to be very hard to Unbreak this position and now white plays a very nice positional move A4 White's Pawn structure here is better because black has over committed three pawns to dark squares white fights for the light squares and this Pawn blocks the bishop so by doing this Jew and June makes a grave positional mistake and white is going to try maneuvering into this territory if white can trade this bishop and this Knight and get a knight to D5 or C4 versus a dark squared Bishop the game is over but that's easier said than done Queen to E2 Rook here the bishop tries to come back and white plays Queen C4 hits the pawn and now B6 black has six pawns out of seven on dark squares that means this bishop is terrible and it means that if white is successfully able to trade away the light squared Bishop white is going to be very happy B4 immediately taken advantage of the weaken structure maybe B5 may be taking on a C5 Pawn takes B4 C takes B4 and now white has secured what's called a queen side majority you'll notice that even here the El was kind of balanced that's because the best thing is for Black to just sit back and wait white shouldn't lock the structure because black can even do something like this but this transformation hoping to reactivate the bishop allows white to go B5 and this is an advantage do you know why it's a queen side majority you have a two on one which simplifies down to a one on zero or a two on zero if you can win this Pawn so bringing the queen back and getting the Knight there while also hitting the Rook this is a miserable position for black and it is just a matter of time Queen slides back to C3 now here you can play Bishop B3 to try to get this and then a knight to C4 but if you play Bishop B3 I'm not gonna take I'm gonna go here then after this you can't move your knight to C4 because I'll take well that's easy then you'll play F3 and then you'll play Knight C4 yes but then I will go Knight H5 and by the time you get to C4 I'm gonna chop chop and take on A4 so you're never gonna get a perfect situation so what does lighting Jay do she just puts the Knight on C4 I told you a long time ago if you trade off Black's light squared Bishop you win this game because Black's position is not equipped to play with a dark squared Bishop it's just not equipped all right essentially what you did is you bought a nice car and then you bought 700 cement blocks and put them in front of your car so you cannot get out of the driveway or the parking garage or your street parking area wherever you park that's what maybe not 700 maybe five cement breaks that's what you did you have a nice car surrounded by cement bricks what do you do first of all that's psycho Behavior go get therapy 98 Bishop B3 and late India has a fantastic opposite color Bishop Dynamic here she's going to try to knock on the door there knock on the door here knock on the door here my friends there are three sides of a chessboard a king side of Queen side and a center and if you are able to win the battle on two of those fronts life is going to be good if you win the battle on three probably you're going to win all black has is this that is the only maneuver that black has remaining in the position she goes Queen C2 Bishop D5 and just one move later she takes she gets rid of the bishop for the night she is not afraid why Rook D5 she just has an ever so slightly more pleasant position and black has nothing when I say black has nothing that is not an exaggeration black has to sit here and hope not to lose black has nothing black can play C4 black can try to trade the Rooks she does white takes on D5 but black is not going to be able to create counter play this is a matter of will later breakthrough correctly or will she break through incorrectly and lose of course she could do nothing but here's the thing it is White's decision to do nothing here it is not Black's decision to do nothing Rook A8 Bishop to D2 King to f8 Bishop C3 forcing black to play F6 black has now fulfilled the destiny of all dark squared pawns and a dark scored Bishop completely miserable position you will notice all of White's pawns are on light squares nearly in fact if white ever plays F3 that will be the case those pawns complement the bishop Queen B3 Queen C8 back Queen C4 Honda G3 improving the position white doesn't know what to do yet so white plays G3 and King G2 slowly sliding forward without taking any risk at all if black plays Rook A7 to try to play Queen A8 white will go here black will play Queen black will play Queen A8 and white will play A5 that is the major idea because after this B6 and then Bishop E3 you cannot take because of various tactics on your king and Rook C5 and Rook C8 so you're just losing Queen E8 H4 H5 Bishop back to D2 and now F4 she's just throwing everything forward the game is being dictated by the Challenger to the World Chess Championship he takes F4 Bishop takes F4 hitting the Rook making it move now Queenie two removing the blockade putting an eye on this pawn and once again forcing the opponent to make a pawn move if we go back throughout this game there have been so many of these instances all the way back here take for instance Queen C4 made black weaken her position with a pawn move that led to this a little bit while later in the shuffling in the trading lateing DIY played this making her opponent play F6 little while later she played H4 to Pro to potentially completely control the line squares her opponent played H5 so what did she do made her opponent make a pawn move made her opponent make another pawn move you see what happens you you make your opponent come to you that's what you do E5 E5 is all a result of a while ago playing F4 this is a master class in demo is in making your opponent tie their shoes together and run off a cliff either they fall flat on their face or they make it to the cliff it's a really bad Destiny Queen to F3 setting up rook to D7 which will just win the game on the spot ready to give up the pawn on A4 completely because if you take Bishop H6 let's say King G8 Pawn takes the king is safe you're getting through you're getting through Pawn to F5 making her opponent make yet another pawn move F5 now the dark squares have been secured Rook D7 Rook A7 seemingly defending everything and in this position Bishop H6 wins on the spot because you have King here and then you take and you win this if King F7 you can take take Queen D5 and there's probably mates later instead does this which actually according to the engine slightly ruins our chances she should have went for the absolute knockout punch but she does it like this and it's still a very difficult position to defend black apparently has to play C4 Bishop C5 but instead black takes the pawn and white plays rugby seven wins this pawn and just has two passers and you're just not going to you're just not gonna be able to stop two pawns Rook A2 Rook B2 Rook C8 and uh she wins the bishop and this is a winning Rook end game you just need to do it the right way but it's winning it's winning because the bishop end game is winning and it's winning because the Rook end game is winning Bishop G5 rookie seven check and in this position Jew and June resigned because this end game is winning for white the promotion Square even though it's a corner Pawn is the right color if it was there this would be a draw that's just one of the tricky rules of Chess so lighting J the Challenger to the Women's World Chess Championship wins game number five in an Italian a very complex back and forth Italian proving I think that there is something yet to be discovered in the Jew and June repertoire will Jew and Jun come back and play another E4 E5 will she go for a sicilian not sure but it's three to two after five games I will see you in the next video after a couple of rounds get out of here
