(tense music playing)
- Last person to leave this pit of money
(cash fluttering) wins $20,000.
(cash register dinging) These contestants are
different than our normal ones. And if you're wondering how
we found them, here's how. Hey, hey, hey, y'all wanna be in a video? Last to leave money wins it. It's 20K. - Yeah. Yeah, for sure. - All right. Hop in the car behind you. - Hop in the car? - Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah. - Did we just get three people? (all laughing)
- All right. - All right. Now we just need one more. - No joke. They legit got in
the car behind us. (laughs) - I hope this is her house.
- No! - Come on!
- I'm not doing it. - Why?
- Let's go. Let's do it. (air whooshing)
- Chris, tell us about your contestant. - His name is Quaid,
(Chris slapping shoulder) but you guys will know
him as "The Winner." - So Chandler, who's your contestant? - This is Mary Lisa. She is gonna win it. She told me she will not let me down. - I did say that.
- If she doesn't, then I'm gonna cry. - This is Thomas. He sold me my truck. - And Ty, who is this? - This is J Cole.
- J Cole? - J Cole.
- All right, J Cole. - You're gonna win, right?
- Yeah. For sure. For sure. - [Chris] Don't get out of
this, under any circumstances - No circumstances, nothing. Easy, dawg. Easy, dawg.
- We're gonna win. (fists impacting) - Oh, how you doing? - Average.
- What about when you win? How are you gonna feel?
- Super average. That's what I like to hear.
- Yeah. (gate slamming) What, y'all are roommates. - Yeah.
- And they were roommates. - [Chris] Quaid's the better roommate. I bet he picks up his
trash and everything. (all laughing) - Our room is squeaky clean right now. (all chatting)
- So y'all are housewives. (all exclaiming)
- Oh! - If I was you, I would
get up and leave right now. (all laughing) - [Chris] Our strategy,
Quaid, is to get that bread. (electronic music playing)
(cash fluttering) - In 15 minutes-
(cash gun clicking) (Mary Lisa laughing) - That's not how you do
it, Chandler. (laughing) - We gotta-
(Quaid patting cash) - I know. He keeps trying to hold my hand. - No, it's definitely
the other way around. - Someone call 911. Seriously, I don't trust this guy anymore. (cash gun clicking) - Aw, that's unfortunate. (gate slamming) - Quaid. Stay nourished, my friend. I'm the best coach. Remember. - Okay. Yeah. I'll keep it in mind. - [Jimmy] Chris, you gave
him my smoothie to Quaid. Well, good. (laughing) - [Chandler] All right. I got you this. It's kind of small, so. - Is that a- (laughs) - Y'all are just
belittling me, aren't you? - [Chris] Ha, belittle.
Get it? She's- (laughing) - You guys- - Y'all are really great to
stare at, but I mean. (laughs) I need a change in scenery. I'm supposed to go back
to school tomorrow. So... (gate slamming) - If you win 20 grand, what
are you gonna spend it on? - Probably gonna go out to
eat, buy some new clothes. - I'm very looking forward to you winning. - Yeah, me too. - Very looking forward-
- Love you. - All right. Whoa.
- Say it back. - I don't know if I'm there yet. - Okay. All right.
(Mary Lisa giggling) (all laughing)
- Meanwhile- - What are you gonna buy with this money? - I live at the beach. So I'm gonna buy a boat. - You're gonna buy a beach? - A- no, a boat. (upbeat music resuming) - 20 K is on the line. - I'm buying plane tickets. - Plane tickets? To where? - Australia, Boss. - Australia? Why Australia? - Hop around with kangaroos. - [Mary Lisa] Why not?
(Ty laughing) - [Jimmy] That's a great idea. Good, good. - If we win-
- Yeah? - We get all this bread. (clapping) So what do you need? - My phone.
- Oh. - Well, if you had your phone, you guys have be in here forever. - True. True.
- That's true. I could look at memes for days. - That's right.
- I like that. - Wow. She's gonna win.
(Mary Lisa laughing) - What memes do you look at? What's your favorite meme? - Area 51, probably. - So what do you need him to get you? Anything besides your phone? - I want Area 51 memes.
- Here's your water, sir. - And I want a lot of them. - [Jimmy] I'll be back. These are the memes he wants. We're just gonna start printing them. Ah, yes. Good set of
memes. Good set of memes. - What is that? What
font size is that? One? - Wait, what do you need? You need air? - Yeah.
(Chandler blowing) There you go. That's it.
(all laughing) This is great. 10 out
of 10 moment right now. So for future reference, if you're ever cold, just
cover yourself in money. (gate slamming) - As you guys remember from
the revolving door video, we have the dice. There's six different options. Three are good. Three are bad. Go ahead and roll it. - Okay.
- Yeah. - Oh, should I- - Pushups?
- Pushups! If you roll pushups, your
partner has to do 50 pushups. - Sorry, babe.
- Literally told you. I told you.
- I know! - Chandler goes, "She's
gonna roll pushups." Now it's Quideka's turn. (claps) I know that's not his
name, but I forgot it. - Quaid. - There you go, don't do pushups. I'm very weak.
- Okay. - I play a lot of video games.
- Easy pushups. - Basketball?
- Basketball. All right. (team chattering)
- Shoot the basketball. - There you go.
- Aw man. - If you make it, it's $300. (dramatic music playing)
(farting effect) (all groaning)
- Boo! Ha! [Jake] Oh it's your
turn. Don't do pushups. I don't wanna do pushups. (die thumping)
(all laughing) - Pushups.
- Why you bullin' me? - Go join Chandler.
(whimsical music playing) (team laughing)
- That's not a push up. That's good enough, dude. - Pushups hurt.
(participants laughing) - [Jimmy] All right. (Chandler vocalizing indistinctly) (ball thudding) - [Mary Lisa] Did you break it? - Let's do another round of the die. - [Quaid] Bag over head? - Yes!
- Yeah! - Who did this?
- This feels more like a- (bag crinkling)
- There we go. - Not- I'm giving him eyes.
- About to say- - I'll give him some cheeks.
(team chatting) (bag crinkling)
(Mary Lisa laughing) Where are your ears at? Do you not have ears? - [Quaid] Right here, bro! - What kind of human are you? - [Quaid] Right here! - There's no ears. - You're way- you're on my
forehead. Right there, bro. (all laughing)
- I'm looking- He looks like a sophisticated gentleman. - [Posh Voiceover] Hello there. (Jimmy laughing) All right. Chris, it's his turn to roll. - All right.
- Weight over head. - You gotta extend.
- Extend. There you go. - [Chris] Push ups, push ups. (all in unison)
- Sit ups. Sit ups, sit ups. - [Tariq] Ty's gonna be ripped after this. (Mary Lisa laughing)
Everybody's taking selfies. - That's on my story.
Go follow me. @mrbeast (die thudding) - Basketball.
- Basketball! - [Mary Lisa] Oh! (farting effect)
- Dang it! (Tariq laughing)
- Is that good? You want me to-
- Yeah, that's good. - [Chris] Don't help her. - It's mutual.
- It's called teamwork. - It's a mutual-
- Teamwork. - [Quaid] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. (gate slamming) - All right, look. (claps) I'm gonna go find a banana tree and cut some leaves off,
and then I'll be back. (clock ticking) It took me forever to find this. (contestants chatting) - [Mary Lisa] All right,
now just stay just like that for the next five hours. - All right. Is that good? (cash register dinging)
- Yeah. Here's your tip. - Thanks very much. - [Chris] All right.
Quaidratic. You wanted air? - That's cheating.
- My God. - [Chris] You've got air.
(pump whirring) (air hose hissing)
- Oh that's good. (torch snapping) - Let's see if we can speed this up a bit. Last to leave flaming money- - [Mary Lisa] Okay. Whoa. (gate slamming) - So now we're gonna take
you guys for a car ride. There's a reason there's wheels on this. - We got-
- Wait, where are we going? - Just don't worry. We've got a lot of stuff
planned for you guys. All right guys. It's time to go on a little trip. (team chatting)
(wall creaking) - [Tariq] The walls move? What? - [Jimmy] It is totally safe,
but none of you have to do it. You will be riding in the back with Chuck. - I can't wait.
- Can't wait? You're excited? - I'm nervous.
- Nervous? - Now I don't know where we're going. - Pumped.
- Pumped? - Ready to go. - My blood pressure is a rising. (Tariq laughing) - So we're gonna drive down the street with you guys in a bathtub. I'm glad they signed the waiver. - Yep. They can't sue us.
- Hell ya. - Yeah, dab. (tub scraping)
(team conversing) - The ramp's not going like it, boy. - Oh!
- Ow! (tub clattering) - Chandler. I resent you. (laughing) - And there we go. You guys are in the back of the truck. So guys, obviously we don't
want the money to fly out. So we're gonna have to put this net over top of you guys, or
over top of the money. - [Mary Lisa] More layers
to the heat stroke? Got it. Oh my God. This is as fast as we're ever going. - [Tariq] I can't believe
we're riding down a real street with them in a bathtub full of money. - Woo.
- Oh my God. - This is way better than
sitting inside the warehouse, guys.
- Oh my God. - [Tariq] There's a big
line at this Chick-Fil-A. Look at this drive through line. - (Jimmy) Dude, change of plans. We're going to Dairy Queen. - [Chandler] Dairy Queen? - [Jimmy] Yeah. Chick-fil-A's busy. No one ever goes to Dairy
Queen. See you there. (truck engine rumbling) - [Chris] What is this? Why is this a thing? - [Jimmy] How did we get this big? - We're doing it. We're
really out here doing it. - We are out here doing it. What other YouTubers are
pulling four random people in a bathtub full of
money around their town? - It's really specific.
I don't think anybody. (all laughing)
- I know, exactly. You wanna know how many
wolves do it in a week? - One.
- Oh, one. (car engine rumbling) - Hey Chand.
- What's up, darling? - What's up? How was the drive? - It was great. The breeze- - Yep. Oh, we're moving again.
- Chris? Oh Chris- - [Jimmy] Thought what we
were doing was illegal, but now I'm certain. This is illegal.
- Yeah. - [Quaid] Can I get a chicken
sandwich with a side of fries? (upbeat music playing) - I just heard someone yell
"MrBeast" in the faint distance. - [Girl Offscreen] MrBeast!
- How's it going? (girl screaming)
- We wanted to say hi. - I thought I heard
someone in the distance. - It was him.
- That's what I heard. (upbeat music playing) - I wonder what they're
talking about right now. - [Quaid] There's lots of
footsies going on right now. - [Mary Lisa] I know, I'm moving my legs to try to get more air.
(wind whipping) - [Quaid] Getting footsie
from two different directions. - What challenge are you doing? - We're in money. And then whoever gets
out last gets all of it. - [Jimmy] Sorry. We just
needed a little more money. Give me a second.
(clock ticking) Got a dollar. (all groaning)
- Oh! It's- - We had a dollar. - There we go. Okay. You guys can keep
going. That was all. - Your hand's on my leg
now. You've upgraded. (Mary Lisa laughing)
You're taking it further- - You're sitting way
too close to me. Okay? Can you just get out?
(all laughing) (truck engine rumbling) - Don't die! - I'll try not to! - Very smart idea for the fishing net. (wind whipping) - [Mary Lisa] I would've
never thought about that. (upbeat music playing) - [Jimmy] All right
guys. We are back home. You guys are getting push
out, back into the warehouse. - Take 3, 2, 1 go.
- Oh! (tub crunching) - What was that? - You just break the
window with your butt? - How did you do-
- Hold on! - [Ty] Look at them glutes, baby! - My butt-
(all laughing) - What? - How do we explain that to the insurance? - I'll offer a thousand dollars if someone gets out now
to make this easier. - Ooh.
- Wait, wait, wait. (Ty screaming)
(all clapping) - We had to lighten the load. So I offered him a thousand
dollars if he'd get out. There. We're good.
- We're good. They survived.
(team cheering) So our first contestant has gotten out. How does it feel? You still
made a thousand dollars. Not bad. - Not too shabby. - Yep. Well, Ty made nothing. - Oh, I'm sorry man.
- Zero. - All right. Well, you
can go home now, Ty. Are you jealous that he's
standing out there and you're not? - Not really.
- Not really? - Not really.
- Why not? - I'm good for another like five hours. - [Jake] He's about to win this ten grand! - How about you? - Oh, I'm good. - What was going through
your mind when I said a thousand dollars? - [Mary Lisa] He tried to get out first. - Really?
- Yeah. - Oh really? - What? Well, did you?
- No. What? No. - [Jimmy] How about you? - Nah, I'm- I'll stay put. - Yeah, going for the 20? - Yeah. Why not? Might as well. You know? - All you have to do is sit there. - That's what I like to hear. - That's what I do best. - That was crazy. It was pretty sweaty. I had a great experience. It was fantastic. - Would you do it again?
- Most definitely. - [Tariq] That's actually baby powder. An umbrella- now you give her an umbrella? - Watch.
- That's really nice. - That feels so good. - I'm really good at this. - When did you learn this?
(Chandler laughing) - Since the ripe age of 12. - Play with umbrellas all day. (gate slamming) - Hey guys, future Jimmy. I'm watching the video. And I just realized, we never mentioned that the contestant splits
the winnings with their coach if they win. I made it that way so the
coach would be incentivized to keep their contestant company, go buy them things, and
just take care of them. I don't know why I
thought we mentioned that, but we never did. Anyways. Back to the video. - How long do you think
you've been in here? - Six hours, maybe? Feels
like a trillion years. (Mary Lisa laughing) - I don't carry around a wallet anymore. Do you know what would be sick? Is if you said the amount, the
amount you want to shoot out- - 450. Yeah.
(all laughing) - So then when you pay,
it just shoots at them. - How you holding up on bathrooms? - It's getting there. I'm gonna try to, I'm trying- (bottle crunching)
I'm holding out. - [Chandler] I'm going
to get you something. I'll be right back. (vegetables scraping) - What is this?
- Oh my God. - Oh no, you did not. - Premium treatment. - That is great. (Mary Lisa gasping)
- Oh, no regret. - Really need to use the restroom. - Really? - Yeah. I think my girl's
kind of pissed at me. So we'll see. We'll see how longer I can play it out. - What's the biggest
struggle for you right now? - Had to pee for like a while.
- Really? - But I can hold it. - My dad has trained me for this moment. We always go on road trips, Pennsylvania, and he never wants to stop and pee. So... - Oh. - [Chandler] So you're
a trained professional. - I'm a trained
professional at not peeing. - Wow.
- Well that's funny, because I take baths
like these all the time. (all laughing) - So you wanna use the restroom? You wanna use the restroom-
- So bad. You do not understand. - Oh my God.
- I don't know, man. - He's struggling.
- Yeah. I think I might have to call it. - Okay. I mean, if you
wanted, but ten grand's a lot of money. - It is a lot of money. All right, all right,
we're doing it together. - I'm gonna grab your sweaty pits. - One, two, three-
(team clapping) (Quaid groaning)
(disappointed crowd effect) - He's done.
(Chandler clapping) That's it, man. Yo, he just got out.
(Chandler clapping) We're really gonna win now. Aren't we? - Yeah.
- Get out. Why are you gonna sit here and suffer for Jake to win 10 grand? - I'm gonna get 10 grand. - I'll give you two
grand if you get out now. - Yeah.
(Chandler clapping) - It was pretty crazy. Honestly. - You still couldn't win. - Yep. - You gave up 10K for that girl. She better realize that this
man, Quaid Station Four, is the best boyfriend in the world. - There we go.
- There's only two left, Jake. - I know. - Still in it?
- Yeah. - I got you a present. (air conditioner thumping) - Oh my God. (laughing)
- God. - He said he was hot, so. - How much was that?
- Don't worry about it. - How much was it? - Like 300, but it's fine. (gate slamming) - Have we ever had a female
win a challenge before? - No.
- Really? - You can make history.
- Oh my God. - You'll be-
- You're gonna be the- - [Chris] Bag over head. - No, you have to write on the bag. I need a girl's face.
(bag crinkling) - Think of the millions of women that watch all our videos. They're looking up to you right now. - They better be. - You could be the first female in history to ever win a MrBeast challenge. (gate slamming) - Wait, what are you guys doing? - Origami.
- Origami. - What's origami? - I don't know.
- Folding things. - You're so nosy, Tariq. Let us do our own thing. - What is, wait, what is that? - That's a shirt. (laughs) - That's a shirt?
- It's a shirt for a mouse. - It's a collared shirt. (gate slamming) - [Mary Lisa] So how are you feeling? You're looking a little tired. - Sweet. Oh, someone's
trying to FaceTime me. - Hey, I'm still doing
this challenge thing. It's me and this girl left. - This girl. Ouch. (laughs)
- And we're sitting- - So you're mad. All right, well, have fun. - See, this is why you
just shouldn't date. Because you have nobody waiting on you. - The girl I'm talking
to thinks I'm having fun with some other girl. - I mean-
- This isn't fun. (all laughing) - This is not fun.
- I'm having fun. - You're talking to a girl, and she's getting kinda, you know- - Well, she called earlier.
- So- He answered to say, "I can't talk." And she overheard her saying, "This is why I don't
get in relationships." (Jimmy clapping) And she's like, "Have fun with the girl
you're hanging out with." - Really?
- She probably thinks I'm lying about this whole thing, 'cause it does sound so far-fetched. (Mary Lisa laughing)
- Oh my God. - All right. I don't want her to hate me. - Literally. That's what happened? - What?
- I'm talking- - You should get out to go talk to her. - I can't. I've invested too much time. - You're gonna choose
money over your girl? - No. - Do you feel bad for what you've done to
this man's relationship? - Yeah, put her on- - I'm sorry I laughed. (gate slamming) - I'm getting tired. I thought I had this in the bag, but if she can hold her
pee longer in than me- - Give. It. Up. (laughs) - Thomas, give me the rundown. I'm tired. - Okay.
- I got pee. Again-
- Be honest. - I just hear a bunch of excuses. - Be honest. - What? I kind of want to go make sure my lady friend's all right.
(Mary Lisa laughing) - Oh, you're gonna turn
down 20 grand for her? Or 10 grand for her? All right. Well, you sound
like you want to get out. Go ahead. But you can still stop, all right, okay- (all chattering)
- He's done. (Chandler clapping) - That is out. - Oh my God. Get me out of here. - (Chandler) Okay.
(Chandler cheering) - You said you were gonna
say one minute longer. - No, no, no.
(Jimmy laughing) - Before you get out,
let's document. Chandler. You won the revolving door. You've won the rollercoaster. And now you've won this. You lost 15 challenges in a row. And now you've all of a
sudden won three in a row. - I went out of the country
and came back a new man. That's all you gotta say.
(Mary Lisa and Jimmy laughing) They started just slapping me. And I was like, okay, I'll win. (Jimmy and Tariq laughing) - Oh my gosh, I have to pee. - What are you gonna buy? Chandler, what are you gonna buy? - [Cameraman] What would
you get if you won 20 grand? - I'm getting an ostrich. - An ostrich?
- Yes. - Where is the ostrich? (clapping) - [Tariq] Where is the ostrich? - Yo, I can't really like have him, 'cause it's kind of like, illegal. - Guys, riot. Comment on every video until he gets an ostrich. - If I can get some legal documentation for an ostrich, I'll get one. - Mary Lisa.
- Yes. - Congratulations. You are the first female winner- - Yes I am. - [Tariq] of a MrBeast challenge. (party horns blowing) - We.
- We. - Team effort.
- Team. Team. - Couldn't have done it
without the ice packs. - That's all I really got her. I'm not gonna lie. - [Tariq] What are you
gonna do with the money? - Maybe go on a shopping spree. I don't know, experiment. Maybe a new phone-
- Experiment. (laughs) - And thank you MrBeast. It was great. Kind of, but the ending was great. (all laughing) - So how much have you
won recently, Chandler? - 50.
- 50,000. - Five.
- 8,000. - And eight.
- Wow. You're getting rich, man. What is that? - Makin' makin' rich. - It's a lot.
- It's a lot of money. - It's math.
- It's like 70. - Dude. That is pretty ridiculous. - So like-
- I spend my money terribly. - Imagine if the other 15 you had won. You'd be on like a million, but you don't have to think about that. Thank you for watching and subscribe. (explosion booming) ♪ MrBeast oh ♪ (explosion booming) ♪ MrBeast oh ♪ (explosion booming)
