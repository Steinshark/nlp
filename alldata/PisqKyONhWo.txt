there's something that no one has ever told you about learning the code everybody include include yourself should learn how to clean coding wanting to consume all the information there is in the world of our program the coding Community online is very different to a lot of the different communities I have been part of in my life people seem to be mostly very positive towards coding and especially to making coding your career but this risks masking some of the realities of learning the code that every single person eventually will have to go through yes even myself I am very guilty of often painting a very Rosy picture about coding and software engineering and everything related to it don't get me wrong I love coding learning the code is probably one of the best decisions I've ever made in my life for many reasons that I very often discuss on this channel but today I want to discuss why most self tour programmers actually fail to learn to code so if you think about the entire learning the code journey and I think there are sort of four key moments where most people usually fall off and it's actually these ones right at the end number three and four that are actually the most annoying ones because you might go through this entire Journey Only to realize these pitfalls right at the end but luckily for you if you watch this video right until the end you're gonna know these things in advance and you're gonna know how to anticipate them and by the way if you find Value in this video make sure to hit the like button down below in the description because it actually makes sure that YouTube will show this video to more people on YouTube we really recommend it more especially this video right here I think it's super super important for everyone who's trying to get into coding who wants to learn the code to understand and to see as early as possible so the process of learning code always starts off with what I call the early enthusiasm now this first stage of early enthusiasm your motivation is very very high right after you started learning the code or perhaps before you started you've seen all the inspiring video titles of some idiot learning to code in four months and getting a job other people will becoming Google Engineers after six months of teaching themselves to code you're excited about the idea of delving deeper into this unknown and exciting area of programming and of understanding technology you can't wait to get started and become an Unstoppable hacker who's just able to hack everyone's passwords and get into the network of your neighbors yeah that's not really reality and that is why the first place where self door programmers fail is after this early enthusiasm wears off and you fall into what is known as the dip that's what I love about the long tail is that what Christianity the dip is a concept popularized by a book by set coding of the same name it explains the stage of learning or building anything where you realize that the thing you're trying to achieve is actually a lot harder and a lot more complicated than you initially anticipated the things that kept you going in the beginning like the idealized version of the thing that you're learning suddenly no longer work anymore and instead all you see in experience is difficulty demotivation and hardship it's the part of the process where this initial honeymoon period of your Learning Journey is over but also before the point where you know enough where simply the act of being good that something makes the process enjoyable that is why this dip is the place where most people quit and wear countless dreams go to die [Music] but we any Pursuit the dip is actually the most important part of your journey in order to be able to get out of the dip you will have had to have defined a very strong reason for you to learn the code and so that is why in fact the first place where people fail isn't even the dip but it is before it up here before you throw into the dip you probably Define some reason why you're learning the code for yourself and because a lot of the reasons why people getting the coding aren't the right kinds of reasons at all like some glamor of being a programmer or the image that you might have of software Engineers all of that will wear off and none of that in my experience it's going to be strong enough to keep you going so what is actually the reason why you got into coding that is the first question that you need to ask yourself I remember when I have been in the dip myself when my motivation goes down whether it's with coding or learning a new language or learning to make these YouTube videos the sort of image I have in my head of the thing always changes along the way often quite drastically there's many skills that I have completely quit for example learning Chinese or learning graphic design I am a quitter I admit it but being a quitter is actually not a bad thing the main message of the book The Dip is not that you should just push through the dip by any means necessary it is that you should figure out at this point is learning The Thing Worth the potential reward you should strategically determine which Pursuits are worth the pain and which are not so the second question to ask yourself is is the pain of learning code worth the reward that I will get the end of it earning the code is hard it requires extreme patience and discipline to sit in front of a computer for hours and hours and hours every single day potentially for months another thing you'll realize is that coding can be very lonely so that's something to you that you maybe hadn't realized before but yeah now you realize that you actually don't enjoy learning something on your own with very little social aspect that might mean that coding is not for you you need to listen to yourself if you find yourself absolutely hating the process for in one of these or any other reason maybe sticking to it is not worth it for you and a lot of people do determine this for me it was and if you hadn't been you would not be watching me right now maybe you would be watching a Channel about learning Chinese instead that would be interesting so if you are able to decide that the pain of learning the code is worth the reward and or you're able to enjoy the process enough to get you through the dip and you keep doing that for a very long period of time eventually you are going to start climbing out of it for me this was when I finally started to be able to build the kinds of coding projects that I myself wanted to build I got the point where I was able to solve problems using code and I can tell you that that is an amazing feeling and at this point you will think that you have made it but there is still prob problem two problems in fact and these two last questions are probably the most important ones for you to be aware of considering that for most people the goal of your learning code is probably to make it to some kind of a career before we discuss this last two crucial details I want to talk to you about a class that I have created about specifically how to learn to code effectively and all the things that you need to consider before you start learning the code I've hosted the class on skillshare who are also the sponsor of today's video this course goes into more details into all the things that you need to consider before learning the code I get questions from you guys all the time about motivation and like what kind of projects to build like how to get started learning code what language to use so what I decided to do is collate my answers in a very detailed way into one class it's like an hour long or even less than that that you can access for completely free using my skillshare link Down Below in the description I'm confident that the class is going to help you and with that free trial you might as well check out all the other classes that are available on skillshare I've been using skillshare myself ever since I started learning skills online myself I think learning different skills online is the number one thing that has completely changed to my life I've used skillshare to learn about productivity about photography about editing videos pretty much every single skill that I wanted to learn online or in my life the first place where I always went to was skillshare in this Modern Age you need to have skills and ideally you need to have many different skills and skillshare is just an amazing place for you to learn pretty much whatever you want learning different skills is like the thing that gets me excited the most in this entire world so that is why I'm so excited to share about skillshare for the first thousand people to use this link will get a one month free trial of skillshare so go check it out down below in the description so the last two points I wanted to discuss are about the job of being a professional coder and if becoming one is even worth it for you because I can tell you that for a lot of people it's not this is a couple of myths that I usually go around myth number one about coding jobs coding jobs are easy and all you have to do is work like one hour a day Sip Coffee and go have lunch with awesome co-workers wrong in fact they can be really really boring yes sometimes the job can be very easy and especially compared to a lot of the different high paying Industries in the world like Finance Consulting the law but that is not always the case and it's not the case that you can get away with doing completely nothing either but the biggest truth is that especially if you're working for a big company the work that you're doing at a junior level can be extremely extremely tedious and very boring and the image that you have of coding and maybe doing your personal projects or whatever you're building it can be very exciting but the reality of working for a big company these are the things you're doing as a junior are very repetitive things like You're copying files from one folder to another you're changing one line in some configuration file and then doing that 50 times for 50 different repositories dude I wish there was AI that could do this for me care for what you wish for and I will say that some of these problems could probably be sold by working for a smaller company people have said that working for smaller companies can be more exciting and you're certainly learning more so here the question you need to really ask yourself is what is the specific path of coding that you want to pursue and here it's obviously fine before you even get into this point it's very useful to stop and think to yourself what are the things that you prioritize do you do you prioritize the stability of working make for a bigger company but you're willing to go through sort of more boring work and slower processes and all the corporate BS that you'll have to enjoy or do you prefer the freedom of perhaps freelancing with slightly more uncertainty about when you'll be working the way you'll find out is by just researching this a lot and this is something that I definitely failed to do myself the second myth about coding jobs which leads to our last question is that once you learn the code you've learned the code and you don't need to keep learning anymore when I made my video about learning the chord in four months the purpose of that was not to say that I learned the code in four months and got a job and then I just stopped learning because instead to say that I learned the code enough to get a job in four months but after that I have kept learning for like a full year after that and that is something that you need to keep doing if you want to succeed in this field the last question to ask yourself are you willing to keep learning throughout your life are you the type of person who's excited to keep learning about coding as long as you want to do it because that is something that you have to do many people realize once they already get to this point they might already get a job but then they realize that they still have to spend so much time learning and so much time figuring out all these new Frameworks and things they actually don't enjoy anymore so make sure you're the type of person who will enjoy this those are the four questions that you need to ask yourself to figure out whether you can actually get through this entire process it's not an easy process if you're struggling and if you're in the dip like I imagine that a lot of you are right now you might be thinking that you're just not good enough to learn the code or you were just not destined to be able to learn the code and you might be on the verge of giving up but I strongly believe that absolutely anyone can learn to go yes despite the fact that probably most people fail to learn the code almost anyone can so how can that be if you fail to learn the code the reason why you will fail to learn the code is not because you can't learn the code because you're not willing to it's because you're not willing to sacrifice the things that you need to sacrifice to do it successfully and I can't tell you whether giving those things up and whether going through the pain of the beginning stages of learning is worth it for you you have to Define it for yourself by answering these questions by doing proper research and really thinking about whether this is a journey that you want to get on I can tell you that on the other side for me it has been one million percent worth it it's not about whether you can learn to code it's about are you willing to voting at the end of the day is just about logical thinking and everyone can train their brain to do this but you might still not quite know exactly how to do that so that is why I made this video right here where I explained you exactly how I just forced my brain to be able to think programmatically and to learn to code specifically I think it's going to be highly valuable to you so I recommend you go watch it right now if you enjoyed this video again make sure to leave a like down below in the description with that I will see you in the next video [Music]
