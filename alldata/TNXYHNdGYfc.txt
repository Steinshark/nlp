I predicted the collapse of this billion dollar company that went bankrupt today and I'm going to show you how I shot an entire video about it predicting it yesterday and it was supposed to come out yesterday but it decided hey these are Big allegations I should give them a chance to respond for comments which was a huge mistake basically I emailed them I said hey I think you're lying I think you're insolvent I have a lot of reasons for thinking so and I'm gonna do a story about it in 24 hours and a few hours later Genesis did respond all right but not to me they responded to their clients they had a call with them at 7am basically saying hey uh oops we've been lying for the entire week we don't have the money after all now uh honestly from my perspective it's been difficult to not see this is like them front running the story although being objective about this it's probably pure coincidence because I wasn't the only one talking about this and this is a billion dollar company it's hard to believe they'd spend their time watching coffeezilla but I'm just gonna say I am biased on this one because I sent them an email and like and then right after that they admit they don't have the money so that's just my bias I wanted to let you guys know that ahead of time either way I guess I'm just upset that this video didn't come out before their collapsed like it was supposed to because that was supposed to be the point of all this I will say though if you're following me on Twitter I did warn you guys ahead of time five days ago to take your money out of Gemini earn today Jim and I earned did pause withdrawals because of this Genesis story we're about to talk about so I know I was able to warn some people I just wish I was able to warn more people and today I just want to show you the video of me predicting the collapse of Genesis obviously at this point it is too late but I think it's a super interesting time capsule because while in hindsight it's obvious beforehand there were serious red flags so I have not added anything to yesterday's video because I wanted to leave it exactly as is and here's that story here's me predicting it it was supposed to be called The Fallout of FTX [Music] all right the Fallout of FTX has been horrific they owe between 10 to 50 billion dollars according to bankruptcy filings and could owe up to a million people money that they do not have meanwhile their CEO is busy on Twitter trolling people saying what Believe It or Not these cryptic tweets are some of our only Communications from the world's most formerly generous billionaire well that in a New York Times interview where he told them quote you would have thought I'd be getting no sleep right now and instead I'm getting some it could be worse oh man where would we be without the hard-hitting questions of the New York Times millions are suffering but at least Sam is sleeping soundly but it's not even just Sam's direct victims that I want to talk about today nearly everything besides Sam's sleep schedule have been affected crypto as a whole faces existential risk as people lose trust in Magic internet money but there's also an indirect risk of all these companies that loaned SBF money now some of the lenders could be going bankrupt as well and this is what we call contagion it's like when you have a nuclear blast you have the immediate Direct Hit the explosion itself but then there's also radiation it's slower sometimes invisible at first but it hurts more people and we've already seen signs of contagion coming from companies like block fight earlier this week they paused withdrawals citing significant exposure to FTX there's also other companies like salt lending who also paused withdrawals for the same problems and this is what contagion looks like when other companies face troubles because of one company going under and I think it's important to report on companies that fall apart and explain like what happened but unfortunately it's already too late to save anyone on blockfi or salt Because by the time a company has paused withdrawals it's too late all you can do is is pray they come back so today I want to talk about a company that it's not too late for a company that hasn't gone bust yet and I want to warn people ahead of time but I want to emphas size that this is a theory and their Financial Health could be better or worse than I know I'm just sharing my opinion based on the facts that are available so let's talk about Genesis now many of you might not recognize the name but they're huge lenders in crypto who at one point had 4 -5 billion Target retail Traders like everyday people like you and me instead they worked with other institutions so if you're thinking well okay that just means I'm not affected right well don't be so sure even if you've never heard of these guys specifically you could have had money with them for example let's say you had your money in the gemiini earn program which advertises eight percent on your crypto if you leave it in the hands of the social network rowing team now you might think this is a great deal you see the Winkle Twins and decide finally someone you can trust right or at least someone you can backstab but the problem you might not see is that you're not just trusting Gemini you're also trusting the people they lend your money to for that return so who is that well it's in their terms of service there's only one approved borrower of the Gemini earned money Genesis Global Capital now Genesis Global capital is a subsidiary of digital currency group and an affiliate of Genesis trading which we'll come to in a moment but what does Genesis Global cap Capital do with your money alongside um Genesis trading well they lend it out again and here's where we get to a problem sometimes the people they lend it out to it doesn't work so well remember our video on three arrows Capital the huge hedge fund that blew up 10 years ago I mean I'm sorry uh blew up a few months ago well three arrows Capital took out billions in loans from none other than Genesis who actually was their largest lender with a 1.2 billion dollar claim now their loan was partly collateralized meaning they didn't lose the entire 1.2 billion that collateral was made up of a lot of grayscale Bitcoin trust grayscale ethereum trust and some other tokens which Genesis basically all kept but despite liquidating them they faced hundreds of millions of dollars of losses according to coindesk now around that time Michael Morrow the CEO announced that they had thoughtfully mitigated our losses with a large counterparty no client funds are impacted translation we just got screwed but we're trying to pretend nothing happened I think it's interesting to note actually that Michael Morrow is now the ex CEO of Genesis and is now on vacation according to his Twitter which I gotta admit now on vacation is what I would say if I were thoughtfully mitigating the loss of my job but it doesn't stop there because the parent company of Genesis is called digital currency group and they actually assumed This 1.2 billion dollar claim supposedly leaving Genesis with no outstanding liabilities but not having that 1.2 billion dollar claim doesn't mean suddenly they get their money back it just means they don't have a 1.2 billion dollar claim on their balance sheet anymore it's now on Daddy's balance sheet okay why does this matter well it's important to the Financial Health of Genesis because even the money they did get back from three arrows Capital the collateral may not have been immediately sellable for example the grayscale Bitcoin they liquidated as collateral those assets are actually part of another subsidiary of their parent company digital currency group called grayscale Bitcoin trust and I know if it sounds confusing I'm trying to make some graphics for this to make it a little more clear either way this is important because there are reasons why if your Genesis or dcg digital currency group you wouldn't want to sell a bunch of a sister company shares for cash because it would hurt your other business especially at a time when grayscale Bitcoin is already on life support trading at a 40 percent discount incidentally doing this trade is sort of what got three Euros Capital liquidated in the first place but that's another story so it would deepen your losses if you sell so what do you do well it looks like genesis or dcg decided to hold on to these grayscale Bitcoin trust shares I guess in the hopes that they would go up in the future and they may have even bought more of them because based on grayscale's 10q SEC filing it shows that their parent company digital currency group have been spending millions of dollars buying up shares in grayscale quote from March 10th 2021 through September 30th 2022 dcg has purchased a total of 771.8 million dollars worth of shares in the trust all right what does all of this mean well it means that Genesis a giant lender of crypto got a billion dollar hole they tried to push on to Daddy when three hours capital win under in return they got a few tokens and shares in a sister company they can't really sell and it looks like they probably didn't sell because it's going to make their other business do worse not only that their parent company also seems to have been dumping even more money into these grayscale shares 771 million dollars worth and these funds aren't exactly liquid because as I said they're trading very low so the last thing they're going to want to do is sell these at a deep loss and now finally we're going to get to the FTX Alameda part of this story because coming into fall season Genesis and dcg like aren't looking great so this is where we could be seeing the final straw to break this whole thing although again this is just my theory right because everyone's panicking right now Bank runs are happening everywhere and it might be that Genesis just doesn't have the money okay so here's the evidence on November 8th Genesis says of the FTX collapse that they managed our lending book and don't have any material net credit exposure now to me this sounds a bit like thoughtfully mitigating our law losses but whatever pretty soon a day later their story kind of changes they say quote we hedged and sold collateral resulting in a total loss of about seven million dollars across all counterparties including Alameda but once again they insist everything's fine right they say our exposure to FTX has no impact on our ability to serve our clients now the next day you might not be surprised their story changes yet again they say oops did we say we lost 7 million we meant that our derivatives business has 175 million dollars in locked funds in our FTX trading account oops I guess uh they missed that one guys you know sometimes I leave a quarter in the couch sometimes Genesis accidentally finds 175 million dollars stuck in a bankrupt company it happens guys it happens still though they claim once again that quote our operating capital and our net positions are not material to our business okay now that might be believable if the next day once again something didn't change because dcg announced that they were infusing Genesis with with 140 million dollars and naturally the question is is if your business is totally unaffected by 175 million dollars going missing why do you need to infuse that company with capital and if you're trying to make sure everyone thinks you're fine why not completely replace the loss because as some of you might have noticed you math whiz kids out there 175 million dollars is bigger than 140 million dollar infusions so my theory well I think it's because dear old dad the digital currency group might not be so liquid right now and I think Genesis is even more in the whole now once again this is speculation but it's based around facts around genesis's already large losses and dcg's nearly billion dollar purchase of their own grayscale shares that they can't easily sell I just don't believe that they're doing that well right now now of course could I be wrong could they be completely liquid and have tons of money extra yes absolutely would I bet my money or your money on it no I wouldn't hence the making of of this video I just want you guys to be aware of what's going on you can make your own decisions with what you want to do but if you're in the Gemini earned program me personally I wouldn't be so comfortable or if you're in a lending platform where you're not sure if it's related or they're lending out to Genesis um just be careful because you might be at risk of contagion even if you think you're fine now by the way I want to be clear this whole thing is being extremely charitable to dcg and Genesis I feel like I'm doing free charity work here because actually I'm taking them very much at their word which I don't believe is actually that reliable this is when I'm saying that their losses are truly as small as they say despite every evidence seeming to suggest that whenever possible they minimize their losses take for instance their statement about ftt this is of course the token of FTX and it's nearly worthless now Genesis said that they had no material exposure to FDT or any other tokens issued by centralized exchanges but we basically know this not to be true or at minimum is super disingenuous because using the platform Arkham intelligence I took a look at their books and found that Genesis had a lot of ftt and was actively receiving hundreds of millions of dollars of ftt from Alameda as recently as one month ago presumably in exchange for loans and as recently as one week ago they were sending huge chunks of FDT not to FTX or Alameda but to binance now why would they do that if they were not selling now what does this mean well Genesis obviously had exposure to ftt from Alameda maybe in the hundreds of millions of dollars so when they're saying they didn't they're either lying or trying to obfuscate the fact that they sold them like last week while the market was crashing with everyone else but there's also this whole dance in their language around genesis's relationship with FTX and Alameda in fact they say they have no ongoing relationship but this may be the greatest technical truth since I said I appeared on a Netflix show because what does no ongoing lending relationship mean would you cut it off 10 seconds ago like what is that obviously you lended to them at some point and I attempted to reach out to Genesis Global Genesis trading and dcg for comment and here's what they said about all this anyways that concludes my video about the Fallout of FTX and Genesis just remember there's lots of people pretending they're fine right now even when they're actually very close to bankruptcy so you need to stay safe out there don't just take people at their word when they say they have no exposure to FTX or Alameda make sure you verify okay thanks for watching bye
