[Music] [Applause] [Music] i've been taking some time lately to look back on my career as a documentary filmmaker and all the amazing things it's allowed me to experience this job has taken me so many places from the coastal mountains of canada to the tops of volcanoes in the south pacific to the heroin fields of mexico and so much more for someone like me who spent a good part of my life as a traveler and wanting to see as much of the world as possible making documentaries has given me opportunities that i never would have dreamed of and that's what i want to talk about today why of all the different parts of the film industry i chose to make documentaries how it's changed my life in some amazing ways and why it could be a great fit for you too for the right kind of person i truly believe that making documentaries is the best job in the world and in this video i'm going to tell you why hey guys welcome back and if you're new here my name is luke forsyth documentary cinematographer and filmmaker and on this channel i teach the skills i've learned over 10 years working in the documentary photography and film industries documentary is the weird unwanted stepchild of the filmmaking industry it isn't as high paying as the commercial world and if you're looking to make a huge name for yourself hollywood is probably a better choice but before you rush to click off this video to find out how to get into those sectors instead there's some great things that working and docs can bring to the table that even the most famous dps or richest commercial guys will probably be jealous of so let's get into it my path into video production wasn't straightforward at all i didn't go to film school and i wasn't born knowing that making documentaries was what i wanted to do with the rest of my life i spent most of my 20s just traveling to different countries as a backpacker trying a lot of different things and it wasn't until relatively late in my life that i picked up a camera seriously i mean i planted trees for six years i worked on farms i picked fruit i crewed on sailboats i taught english in south korea all things that are totally unrelated to video production for most of my life i wasn't interested in jobs i was interested in experiences i wanted to learn about the world and test myself in difficult situations i wanted to understand how other people lived and see ways of life that were totally different to the way i grew up in small town canada and i'm guessing that if you're watching a video about becoming a documentary filmmaker you're probably pretty interested in the world as well i traveled full-time for almost four years working odd jobs to keep me going and spending as little money as possible i learned a lot and i would never trade that for anything but as a backpacker i could never get as deep into other cultures as i wanted i idolized photo stories and national geographic and time magazine and places like that where the journalists would embed themselves with their subjects and spend days or weeks or even years getting as close to their stories as possible and traveling lets you scratch the surface of that itch of people and cultures but because you don't have a real reason to spend time there i always found that it was hard to get to that next level of connection and understanding with documentary photography and filmmaking though that problem disappeared when i started working for newspapers like the new york times it not only gave me a reason to be in those places but it gave me access odds are if you approach a random person in the street and ask them if you can just spend a day with them because you want to learn what their life is like they're going to look at you like you're a crazy person but if you have a camera in your hands and explain that you're making a documentary project suddenly there's a reason for you to be there and believe it or not it changes the relationship completely i'm not saying that everyone's going to say yes because a lot of people won't but i found it so much easier to be openly curious about people's lives with the camera even when i didn't have big name newspaper credits or streaming platforms behind me people innately understood that i was there to document them and it made the interaction so much simpler to understand let me give you an example my very first serious documentary project was about child labor in bangladesh i flew to dhaka on a one-way ticket and basically just wandered around industrial areas until i found small factories and then walked inside to see if there were children working amazingly once they saw the camera very few people asked me to leave some of that might be due to how polite bangladeshis are to strangers but i think that if i just walked in there on my own and started staring at people um awkwardly lurking around without any real reason to be there the interaction would have been much more awkward actually after about three days of doing this one factory owner came up to me and asked in english what i was doing in his place i tried to make up some vague description of trying to capture the reality of working life around the world but he saw through me right away he looked at me and said are you sure this isn't about child labor i figured i was done and was about to be thrown out but i was trapped and had to admit that he was right but instead of getting mad he just smiled and said very good you will find lots of this in bangladesh now i realize this is a pretty dark scene and in no way do i find child labor a funny subject it was a weird reaction but it does show how open people get to your presence when they know you're there for a reason this has happened to me again and again over the course of my life as a photojournalist and now as a documentary filmmaker when people see that you're interested in their lives and you're there for the purposes of documenting the doors often open wide and the real learning can start i call this privileged access and for me it's why making documentaries is the best job in the world when you work on a documentary assuming the director and producers are good at their jobs too you get special access to people places and situations that you never otherwise would let me give you another example for a long time i lived in mexico city where i worked on a lot of difficult subject matter particularly migration and the ongoing drug violence crisis if you followed the news at all over the last few years you've probably heard about the huge groups of migrants that used to cross mexico from central america running away from poverty and violence and hoping to make a new life for themselves and their families in the u.s before i got to mexico i was vaguely aware this was happening but it was so far removed from my reality that i didn't have any real idea of who these people were what they were feeling or what their experience was like i'm gonna guess that most of the people on the internet who seem to hate immigrants as well probably don't have any real idea either that's a sidebar and i don't want to get too political here then one day i was hired to follow one of these caravans from the guatemala border all the way across mexico to the border with the u.s for something like 46 days i walked hitchhiked and rode trains with a caravan of 1500 people i wouldn't say i fully understood what they were going through because of course i was in a different position i had a passport and could just fly away if things ever got too rough and don't get me wrong i know i wasn't really going through the same thing that they were but even so it made me so much more aware of what it means to have to flee your home to leave your family behind and cross an entire country so you can hopefully give your children a better life it really put my own privilege into perspective and just how lucky i got to be born into a middle-class life in a safe part of the world it's possible to get some of this knowledge from books or school but experiencing something like that firsthand is just so powerful and i don't think i'd ever have gotten to do something like that if i weren't there to document the camera was my reason for being there it was also the reason people accepted my presence so easily and why they were willing to answer all my questions that's the definition of privileged access i've enjoyed privileged access again and again over the course of my career i got to travel up the entirety of the mekong river for two years stopping all along the way and learning how the river impacted people's lives because of that i now understand how small changes to an ecosystem or environment like a dam or a power plant can impact the lives of millions of people far away i learned firsthand what drug cartels are really all about and how things like fentanyl and heroin are made spoiler alert it's much more complicated than just a bunch of bad guys making dangerous products it's about poverty lack of opportunity corruption and so much more and i never would have understood any of this if it weren't for the privileged access this job has given me i could go on but i think you get the point and i don't want this to come off as me bragging about all the cool stuff i've done what i'm really trying to get across here is that making documentaries has totally transformed the way i look at the world looking back at what i thought i understood as a young backpacker and how i see things now after over a decade of privileged access to some seriously amazing people and places i don't think there's a better job out there for me anyways it might not pay quite as well as commercials or make you super famous like hollywood can but if you're anything like me and you're more interested in experiences and learning about the world documentary filmmaking is an amazing thing to dedicate your life to hopefully this video has helped motivate you to get your own filmmaking or photography career going or for those of you who've already started i hope you're getting as much out of this job as i am let me know what kinds of privileged access you've gotten through your work in the comments below and if you liked this video check out this other one about how the coveted lockdowns made me a better
