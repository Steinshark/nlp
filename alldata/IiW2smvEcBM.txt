- I'm opening a real store that sells expensive
products for only one dollar. You have to spend money to make money. So I'm gonna give that theory a try. My store will be selling
PlayStation fours, TVs, and so much more for only one dollar. This might become one of the most profitable businesses ever. - I'm gonna get more people in the store than we ever had before. - I'm nervous, man.
There is so many people. - We will now begin setting up my store. This is the gaming section of our store. The top shelf will be for
PS4s which are a dollar. - How much is that one? - A dollar. The second shelf will be
for Nintendo switches, which are also a dollar. Fortnite, can't forget about that. This is so heavy. - This is a dancing pole,
not a stripper pole, a dancing pole. - You did a good job. Like, how did you know that the kayak section
needed a stripper pole? - Dancing pole! - Dude, you have a great eye. Meeting! Meeting! Meeting! So we've already spent tens
of thousands of dollars. We got a building, but we still have yet to name our company. That seems like a major flaw. I read a book one time! So what are we naming it? - We should name it dollar beast. - We should name it pewdiepie. Well, yeah, let's call it Shop Mr. Beast. Shop Mr. Beast. - Wait, isn't that taken? - By us.
- Yeah. Consider buying merch
from shopmrbeast.com. Go do it right now. - Do it. - So we're gonna give
you guys a quick tour of the store. For starters, these are
25 dollar gift cards, but they're all a dollar. We've got some high quality
foreign whips, here. So we've got some TVs. We got lava lamps, kitchen supplies. We got some beads, the gaming section. All right, low gangsters!
The store is finally ready! Chandler, you're in charge of the cashier. Chris, you're greeting customers. Garrett, your job is to shred pictures of T Series this entire time. Jake, I'm gonna need you to stand outside. You're security. All right, Jake Paulers.
We just opened our store. Let's see how long it takes
for our first customer. All systems go! - Come on in.
- Welcome! What were you guys doing?
Were you just walking? - I saw the sign on the
top of the building. - Hey, all right. This is a dollar store. Everything here's a dollar. - You can only get one item, though. - Oh, okay. - And you got one minute, and go. - Are the TVs up? - Anything. Yeah. This is our first sale, everybody. Hey! Whoa! - Here you go. - Yeah. I mean, heck yeah. - Thank you. - All right. Have a good day. - This is the best day of my life. - Employee meeting! Employees,
come here, come here. I just realized we should
give you guys name tags. So the customers know who you are. You'll be Cleveland. - Thank you. - You'll be Chris. - Hey, that's my name. - You're Garrett. - Hey. - Go back to your post! I'm
not paying you for nothing. Go, go, go, you're limited to one item. - The PS4? - They do work on PS4. - Think I'm gonna get this. Thank you. - Welcome to our store.
You have one minute. And go. - Oh, she had this dollar ready. Oh, okay. Give me one sec. - Thank you. - So this is everything we've sold. One, two, three, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. Guys, we've made about 17 dollars so far and I'm pretty sure we've only spent like, three or four grand. - Yeah. That's pretty good. - You wake up with a dry nose
or dry throat, humidifier. - Welcome to Shop Mr. Beast! You have 60 seconds, one
dollar, one item, go! - That'll be one dollar. - Thank you guys.
- See ya. - That'll be one dollar, sir. Oh, you love to see it.
Here's your receipt. - There's no sales tax? - Nope.
- Is this legal? - Mhm.
- Yeah, sure. - 100 percent. All right, good bye. - All right, quit asking
questions! Get out. Stay out. Cops are right there.
We might get shut down. It's fine, it's fine. It's not illegal, I don't
think. I don't know. - Are they questioning you? - They're asking me questions. I think they saw me run out with this TV and they might
have thought I stole it so I had to show 'em the receipt. - Yeah. Well, good. As long as you show the
receipt, you should be good. Go, go. Two Keurigs. Even easier
without looking it up. That TV is a spunky TV. - Are you taking that? - All right, she's taking the beats. - Tax?
- No tax. - Sweet. - The government shut down.
We don't charge tax right now. - We're doing pretty good.
We're outta Playstations. We have one TV left. We're doing good. We're selling well. Garrett, sell us something. Come on. - All right, so these Beats
right here actually cost around one dollar and they could be yours. Take it.
- Take it? - Just take it.
- Are you sure? - That's a sale. - Thank you so much. - Wait, Chris, have you verified? - Yes, it is a dollar. Here, let me, boop, okay one dollar. That'll be one dollar, sir. I have no concept of what that is. That is not one dollar. I don't know what a 20 is. - I heard 20. Did he try to offer you illegal money? - He did. - All right, we'll hold these for you. - We'll hold 'em for you. - What is he trying to get? I got him. - Oh, you got 'em? Oh, hold on. Oh!
- Hey! - It's one dollar. We don't know what that is. We only accept one dollar. - Just one dollar bills. - Seriously? - You know what I see? - I ain't seen nothing. - All right, what are you getting, sir? - This is not like, I'm
not gonna have to sign or. - Nope, one dollar. - How'd you get the TV? - We bought it. Have you never heard of us? - You wanna sell it for one dollar? - Yes, sir. - Sir, if you could hurry up and purchase it, that would be great. - All right, there we go. One dollar. - Thank you. - Thank you, sir. Lava lamps are on sale for just a dollar. - I'll take the pole. - Just take the pole. Hey guys. Hey guys. We
have a pole sale, guys. We have a pole sale. Follow us to Chandler here. Chandler's gonna take care of you, okay? - Yeah, why not take the pole? We're gonna have fun. Let's have fun. - I need you to check his
insurance. He's buying a car. - Hey, guys. Welcome to Shop Mr. Beast. Everything here is one dollar. - Pots and pans, shark! How much is this for? - We think 25.
- You think 25. - And we saw somebody
literally run out with a TV and we were like, he stole that. Bye! - Here, pay for that. - Thank you. - What time? - Oh, you guys can come in. - Yay. - It's her 21st birthday. - Should I do that or should I do that? - Wait, you have an Alexa so get that. - Anybody want a condom though? - It's a balloon! It's a balloon. - You want a receipt? - Sure. Thank you! - Bye! - All right, guys. We
are officially closed. Employee meeting right here. All right, guys. Let's
see how we did today. All right. Guys, we probably
made so much money today! We did 81 dollars in revenue.
Bring it up, boys! Ah! We need to add up, how
much money did we spend to make this 81 dollars? All right, guys. So according to the numbers,
we spent 25,000 dollars and we made 81 dollars. - Oooo. - Yes. So guys, I spoke with the
investors 30 minutes ago and they said they weren't happy. Apparently, we lost over 24,000 dollars. - That's outrageous.
- Okay. Guys, I don't care what you think! It's what our investors think! So I was able to secure another
10,000 dollars in funding but they said something has to change. - Change.
- Change. - That's the solution!
- What? - We have to change. - How much should we charge, a penny? - A penny. - Penny! - All right, guys. Tomorrow, we're reopening. Whole new stocked inventory, but everything's a penny
instead of a dollar. So it's super early in the morning and we're
restocking for day number two. - Wait. - What do you got here? - I've got a blender. - Next thing we're gonna sell is Pac Man. - Whoa. - Oh, this is a sloth. I love sloths. - Here, tweak. That was a bad catch. - Do you think the profit margins on a switch would be high enough? - Let me check my graph. Yeah, I think so. - All right, then let's spend
about two grand on switches. We'll make like, five dollars off of that. This store is gonna do so well. Next thing is PS4s, but don't
get it misconstrued, just because they're PS4s doesn't
mean I'm not gonna sell 'em for a dollar. These things right now are 400 dollars. Our store's gonna be 400 percent off. - Is that how math works? - Now, the only game sold
in our store is Fortnite. - Well, that's a free game. - No, it's not, you idiot. I know for a fact this
would sell for a dollar, this would sell for a dollar,
this would sell for a dollar. I definitely just don't want these myself. - This boy is funny. - Let's get some mini arcades. - Guys, we should totally put
this in the store, but like, I won't buy it or anything. - Can I have all four of these? - Sure. - How much are they? 800 dollars? Do you think I'd be able
to sell 'em for a dollar? - Easily. I'll buy one. - Awesome. I want 'em. All right, then. - Buddies. - All right, guys. We're preparing for day number two launch. Things are no longer a dollar. Everything is now a penny. - I got my trusty sign and my thingamajig. Get some people to come to my store. I'm gonna get more people in the store than we ever had before. Hey, you gotta come my way! Come back! All right, I got that job done. I think we'll get about 3,000 more people. - So we took the investors' money and we bought a lot of
stuff from the store. And on top of that, I even put some of my own products here. Guys, I'm gonna be honest. If we don't turn a profit today, I don't think the investors
are gonna go for a third round. - But we need this! - You could be out of a job if we don't pull a profit today. - Oh no. - All right. - But Chandler's just a 15 year old child. - Oh wait, is this child labor? You shaved. Now you look like a kid. - We're officially open! - I just wanna be a meme.
That's why I'm here. I'll pay you a dollar for that, though. - Just bring it to the register.
Is this how this works? - Yes. They only take pennies. - Thanks.
- Oh, thank you. - I found my penny, sir. - I have a penny. - You're done.
- Thank you. - Just one penny, please. - Oh, it's really a penny, not a dollar? - Yes. - It's a dollar? - It's a penny today. - Stop! Wow. I can afford this finally! - Welcome. Everything is one penny. - I thought it was a
dollar. That's even better. - Ma'am, what did you get? - Oh, a TV. But now I'm starting to
think, did I want the laptop? - She has a penny. - All my pennies are from the ground. - Meeting. - Meeting, meeting, meeting. - Obviously our penny promotion
didn't really get out there. I think we just revert
it back to a dollar. - A dollar? The investors will be happy. - Yeah. - Oh, nice. What did you get, sir? - A lot of pennies.
- A lot of pennies. - They're a little heavy. - Here's your receipt, sir. Have a great day. - All right, man. - We rocking the new merch! - Oh! Party with the new merch! - Hold on a second, hold on a second. Where'd you get this? - At shopmrbeast.com. - What is this? - That's fake money. Canada isn't real. - All right. Get him outta here. Kick him out.
- Out. - Whoa, whoa. - Kick him outta here with the item. - We need to sell some Fortnite if you could help drive some sales to this Fortnite section. - Look, I got a new deal for you. - Comes with a Canadian dollar. - A Canadian dollar that we have no clue how much it's worth. - Take the dollar. - And give him his receipt. - This is your receipt, sir. Please come again. Thank you! Oh. Please come again. Chandler, switch with
me. Your job's stressful. - It'll be one dollar. - Sir, what did you get? - Got me a slurp thing! - Yes! - I got about like, a
hundred thousand balloons and I get a free bin! - Oh, that's what I'm talkin' about! He got that for the lady! - Can I get a status report?
How much have we sold? Dude honestly, we're almost
on track to beat yesterday. What'd you get? Pac Man! Waka, waka, waka, waka. - How much did you get for it? - A dollar! One whole dollar. See look, receipt. Mr. Beast. - We're running low on items. Ran into the same issue yesterday. - Oh, I'm getting a bucket of Orbeez. I just watch Mr. Beast all the time. I decided I wanna fill my
own backyard with Orbeez. - Oh, wait. We have a merch buyer. - Actually, give the merch over for free. We don't charge for it. - Thank you, Mr. Beast. - Toaster for one dollar. - Hey, we finally sold the toaster! We sold a toaster,
guys! We sold a toaster. - Here's my dollar. Thank you so much. - You're gonna want this. Oh, wow. - Yeah. The rest of it's over there. We're gonna make this sale for you. You know you want this mannequin. - Hold it all. - I think you want a bunch of matches. - A bunch of matches.
- There you go. Thank you, guys! - Do you accept cards? - Dollars. - Oh, this is awkward. Oh, is this your dollar? - Did they fall from the ceiling. - Think it did. - I have been blessed. - Have a great day.
- You too. - So we're basically pretty much sold out of everything at this point because we don't really
have anything left. So, no more dollar, no
more penny. No more. That was terrible. I'm leaving. - We got a cone! - I got a cone from Mr. Beast! - And there you have it, guys. Our store is empty. All right. Pop the cash register open. All right. - Wow, look at all that bread! - Let's count it all up. 176 dollars and 20 cents. All right guys, the second day is over. Here's your financial reports. So as you guys know, the
first day we spent 25 grand and we only made like, 80 dollars. - Which is not bad. - The second day, we spent 10 grand and we invested a lot of our
own money with the leaf blowers and all our products, brought 'em in, and we made 176 dollars. - Look at that profit! - Bravo. - Lured them in with the flash sale then we hit 'em with the dollar when they were least expecting it. - Why doesn't everybody do this? - Even though we invested some of our own products, I
talked to the investors and 81 plus 170 something
is only like, 250 dollars. - That's a lot.
- Which is great. - They gave us 35,000 dollars in total. So, they're kinda mad
because they gave us 35,000 and now we're only giving
them back 250 dollars. Well guys, I'm sorry to tell you this but we're out of business. They're not giving us
another funding round. Chandler, buddy, you're out of a job. - What? - And it's time to put the store out of business forever. - What would you do if you walked in the store and this is what you saw? ♪ I can't stop this feeling ♪
