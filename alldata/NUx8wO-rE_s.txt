the Cyber resiliency act threatens the future of Open Source now I I tend to stay away from politics little worried that I might be stepping directly into it with this one but let's find out apparently the EU is setting their sights on open source the European Union is currently considering approval of the Cyber resiliency act crazy um that's actually that actually stands for create react app I don't know if you know this but cyber resiliency Act is all wrong that's create react app which has been the terror of many Theo's dreams for a long time now a proposed regulation that is a major threat to the future of the global open source industry while the intention of the ACT is to enhance cyber security which is extremely welcome its current form lacks clear liability exemptions for many open source developers and maintainers which could be a death uh now is that Nell uh let's see for open source in the uh in the EU and which could spark additional Global implications oh interesting oh interesting okay so obviously I haven't read the ACT I have no idea but it sounds like what they're trying to say what he's saying here is that there's a liability now being foisted upon who whomever with whomever is the one that is like uh is like the uh root cause of the liability yeah I know it makes sense but this is this is interesting it's interesting uh I I have no idea so I I'm not going to say whether this is true or not we're just going to take obviously the article at face value I'm not going to go into here and try to understand this thing because I'm sure this thing if we went and we opened it and tried to read it it would end up being like a huge amount of stuff oh okay it's actually really little okay let's just see what this says the proposed regulation for on cyber security requirements for products with digital elements known as cyber resiliency act uh bolster security rules to ensure more secure hardware and software products all right hardware and software products are increasingly subjected to successful cyber attacks leading to an estimated Global and annual cost of cyber crime of 5.5 trillion pounds wait eu's uh such products suffer from two major uh problems adding costs for users and Society one a low level of cyber security reflected by widespread vulnerabilities and insufficient and inconsistent provisions of security updates to address them and in an insufficient understanding and access to information by users preventing them from choosing products with adequate cyber security Properties or using them in a secure manner interesting interesting while existing I mean the second one seems really really difficult like how do you say that you're the best right you know like every year some some you know some zero Day Hack comes out which is just like completely destroying even the most secure software so this second one just seems really interesting to even try to like Define which is like the best software oh I'm choosing the one with the most secure thumbs up right like is it is it really the most secure or just have we not discovered the massive security that maybe even being abused currently you know what I mean uh all right while uh existing uh internal Market legislation applies to certain products with digital elements most of the hardware and software products are currently not covered by any EU legislation tackling their cyber security in particular the current EU legal framework does not address the cyber security of non-embedded software even if security attacks increasingly Target vulnerabilities in these products causing significant societal and economic costs the two main objectives were I identified aiming to ensure the proper function functioning of the internal Market one create conditions for development of secure products with digital Elements by ensuring that hardware and software products are placed on the market with fewer vulnerabilities and ensure that the man manufacturers take security seriously throughout the product's life cycle okay so this is very interesting because obviously what I what I read when I hear this is that there's a stick at the end of this you do it right or else that's how I read that uh obviously uh I don't want to look at the official language the official language is probably going to be just impossible to read uh let's see two create conditions allowing users to take cyber security into account When selecting and using products with digital elements this is again this is that really interesting thing because you know you can only you're only stating you don't have known issues you know what I mean it's just kind of like silly you can't like I I totally get that that you're like this you know like maybe there's some set of Standards like how fast you're supposed to fix it or something like that I don't really understand what they're gonna do with it but still it just seems kind of funny uh for a four specific objections were set up ensure that the manufacturers improve the security of projects with digital elements since the design and development phase and throughout the whole Project Life Cycle I mean really every company I've ever worked at has taken this top priority and got it wrong I like me personally me me the primagen have personally introduced a bug at Netflix that could have taken down and held down Netflix until a fix an only forward fix we could not roll back was possible uh and we literally gave it a name which is the repulsive uh grizzly attack like I me personally created this bug at Netflix okay and guess what there was a group of people who signed off on it okay I literally made this this is me I didn't make the logo or this nice Library okay I was the one who made the bug I made my own my own attack Vector right uh I'm just saying it's it's not that simple right you just don't know uh Insider confirmed 2023 all right uh is there a coherent cyber security framework facilitates compliance for hardware and software producers again I just think that this this is The Impossible right this is The Impossible ask enhance the transparity of security prop uh properties of products with digital elements again I think this is an impossible thing because people you know like remember when they said uh we have to be transparent about salaries in California so Netflix posts salaries that are ranging from 900 or 9 to 90 to 900 000 for every uh software engineering job right we're transparent about what we pay but it literally means nothing to you you know what I mean and that's the problem with these kind of things is that I understand the heart we want to know what products do what but the reality is what you get is just some ridiculous thing in the end right it's just like oh okay cool uh enable business and consumers to use products with digital elements securely again this is again that's the entire field of research right that's what everyone's trying to prevent I don't know any companies that are just like yeah right we're never gonna get hacked we're never gonna get hacked that's stupid right what it really is is it's more like dude hey our 17 year old co-founder has been programming for the last 14 days straight and we're gonna release this product into the public like that's that's where most security problems come from it's not like it's you know it's not like they're like oh hell yeah we're not thinking about that hell yeah we we think cyber security is a joke okay it's a joke no no most people are you know I've never worked at a place where they actually thought that anyways okay so now that we have a general idea of what it's gonna happen let's move on to this one all right the cray the create react app regulation for the EU was proposed on September 15 2022 by the European commission the intent is to prove cyber security and cyber resiliency in the EU through common cyber security standards for products with digital elements really uh honestly I've been working in this field for 15 years or 20 years or some like that and I honestly don't know what this means I'm just gonna throw it out there I literally have no idea what digital elements are okay do they just literally do they just just precisely means things with ones and zeros is that a digital element an nft is an nft is that what it is is it nft if it has a cable uh what if he is Tom and he is a genius okay this is a good point Tom probably could do that and nothing like politics solving engineering problems always the best it's always been the best in theory this is welcome yeah yeah I agree uh but there are some notable areas that many open source developers and Industry organizations are concerned about modern applications are comprised of 90 open source code I wonder if that's true I like where where do you define comprised of right so if you're using Docker is your application comprised of or just uses right what is that what what does that mean I don't know that's a good question right like Linux Linux is obviously the biggest code base you'll always have and dwarfs every single product you've ever used in in your lifetime uh npm install [Laughter] um all right penalizing let's see penalizing open source developers would lead to a fragmented community and hinder important projects across various sectors including critical infrastructure Healthcare and even military systems seemingly this this seemingly proposed uh purposeful omission of exemptions for open source oh okay so we must have missed this there's no clear so obviously again we're just giving the benefit of the doubt to Brian Fox that it must state that there is remember when we were looking at this thing and I said there's if there's likely a stick at the end of this statement meaning you better do X or else it sounds like this is what this sounds like the consequence of the stick right uh would be put undo onus on open source foundations and maintainers and pose a serious risk uh to not just EU Innovation and security but Global collaboration something we and many others in the industry have tried to raise awareness about over the past six months unfortunately the EU has largely ignored the industry's voice holding open source developers whose components end up in commercial products liable for security issues will stifle Innovation and our harm the EU economy without providing uh substantive Improvement in security so if this is actually true right again again we're taking things at face value so if this is actually true and you are holding an oh like the whoever you know creates the security problem uh like you hold them responsible for say the costs of it that does sound crazy like right you can't do that you can't you can't hold like if I make some stupid ass Library and then you use it and it's like hey by the way you like even the license is like use at your own risk then whose fault is it yeah the the license says it's your risk so now you have this whole like whose risk is it right that I mean it'd be very interesting to see a world in which exists where a government entity is pushing responsibility onto somebody who had a license agreement to somebody else who said that they're the ones with the risk right you're gonna have it it just sounds crazy in most open source I mean open source development already sucks okay everyone's already getting in just  on all the time last thing we need is the government shooting on you this legislation is slated for a vote on July 19th in the parliament's industry uh well that means it just got done passing uh research and energy uh Committee of the Italy uh where it will then be sent to the full Parliament if nothing is done it could be adopted without even a vote in the plenary session by the parliament Itself by the way plenty area only knew about that due to TJ uh I feel strongly that if open source industry doesn't uh take a stand now it will become law in the open source Community as we know it will be no more this is so there is some truth to this in the sense that uh there are countries that will um I know there was something with Australia not too long ago that they enacted some sort of thing and then due to its rules it became like a complete rule at Netflix right because it was too hard to try to like program I forget what it was and you know there's also all these like pii personal identifiable information right some countries allow like zero of it and so it just becomes the rule of the software overall even though it's like a single uh country dictating rules for the internet now I know this is like a real problem right uh there's like a real problem where single countries can actually create internet rules when the internet doesn't really have a governing body you know it's just kind of it's just kind of like Whoever has the tightest constraints wins the Battle of who gets the rules you know uh like EU and uh USBC for Apple yeah like I mean as much as I love this change which I think the fact that Apple hasn't used USBC as a crime against humanity it also is just kind of you know for me it's just a little strange right it's just a little strange it's kind of weird you know it's just a weird thing uh you know Apple products now come with USBC it's great for me and my wife because now we don't have to argue over what charger goes where instead we just have a singular charger that works for both my Android and Apple so I love the effect but EU just made something happen in America by making a rule about something right it's just kind of interesting right it's just an interesting thing that can happen and I don't think a lot of people have thought about how our highly connected world can cause places to make laws that affect how other people get you know get stuff um you know what I mean it's just interesting uh create react app discourages commercial support of Open Source the revised create react app offers new cyber security requirements for hardware and software products much like the USS National Security strategy does it calls for software vendors and producers to understand what components are in their software and to be able to recall software whoopsies and to be able to recall where oh man recall software that is affected by vulnerabilities but unlike the recent released details for the US strategy it seems to be trying to call out certain open source projects from foundations and large companies okay so you might be reaching here but okay by doing so it potentially impacts every open source project which creates a web of issues yeah I mean just imagine Linux right like Linux does its best job to do the right thing but still it's a foundation in which plenty of security problems have happened it's very very interesting it goes without saying that open source projects rely heavily on volunteers individual contributors and small teams who often work without significant resources or financial support I would say yeah I'd say this is largely true but there's also a lot of Open Source that is directly sponsored by corporations the support that foundations and contributors do often uh comes from commercial entities who have adequate resources to provide proper development time to give back to the community the current create react app text only excludes OSS software that has no commercial activity around it okay so the left pad incident would have no problem unfortunately it defines commercial activity in this way where the main contributors to free and open source projects are developers employed by commercial entities when such developers or employers can exercise control as to which modifications are accepted in the code base the project should generally be considered to be a commercial nature this is kind of an interesting statement right so how I read this statement is that there's two ways to read this is that if an employee control repo that the commercial can uh can the the commercial entity can assert control over then that's considered commercial but that's also not technically what it says in the text right the text also says uh we're the main contributors to free open source are developers employed by commercial entities so that's pretty much every open source project ever right we're all employed very few are people living for free off of the Goodwill of of issues filed in mean ways when such developers or notice the or or the employer can exercise so when such developers can exercise control as to which modifications are accepted in the code base isn't that literally every open source project ever drop remember ORS can be dropped drop that statement and that's literally every one of my projects right that's all of them that's every single one except for the person not working full-time or I'm not sure how they Define working right should have been an and it should have been an ant it should have been what it should have been is you should have dropped the word developer and said the employer can exercise control if the employer can exercise control one could argue that it's a commercial product okay I get that but since that wow okay that's kind of crazy uh this can be read to me that if the main contributor are not employed or not unemployed then the project is commercially tainted yes that's what I mean yeah exactly it does not clarify uh what was probably intended that the employer fully controls the project here so yeah I agree with that additionally it says accepting donations without the intention of making a profit should not count as commercial activity unless such donations are made by commercial entities and are reoccurring in nature see that's super interesting because here's something that's interesting front end Masters makes a lot of Open Source contribution I think they're at like a half million dollars in open source contributions they're a commercial entity do you see the problem right like they're just a teaching site but does that mean these things are now commercial like I think they gave like Neil Van like a hundred thousand dollars or something like that some just not so amount of money the first part is is acceptable by reoccurring donations from commercial entities are the upside of contributing back to open source I know you really just make it so that contributing back is a downside really it makes contributing back a downside for commercial products oh my goodness uh this may Force the projects to uh reject large contributions to avoid becoming tainted and will likely cause commercial entities to enact further bans on OSS contributions and pull their support entirely this is wild uh further if uh create react app has passed without proper exemptions these developers and maintainers may face legal risks and liabilities for vulnerabilities found in code used in commercial products the OSS developers have no visibility into how and in what instances their components are used only the final manufacturer of the product has the visibility now here's a following up question is this x post facto you know what I mean like if there's a company a that's used some product and it's on version one and then when this thing releases I release version two that says you can use this free of everything except in the EU due to loss right let's just say this actually starts happening but they're using version one version one has a security issue can they then hold me accountable I don't know it's just interesting right the potential legal risk without upside will uh would discourage OSS developers from contributing to and maintaining open source projects this situation not only undermines the spirit of Open Source but could bring about an open source crisis and isolate the EU from the rest of the world non-eu open source producers will avoid the EU Market meaning no access to Linux Apache kubernetes and many other projects this feels like fud right like that it's really in that intense but we also don't like until the first lawsuit drops from the government we don't know what's going to happen like real talk we don't know what's going to happen if if a lawsuit you know just like uh everyone got all up in arms about the rust Foundation dropping this um trademark policy and saying that we're overreacting and all that but in the same week a very similar trade policy from Oracle made somebody take down a website called Java rust for JavaScript developers Oracle made them take it down because it contained the word JavaScript now imagine a world where rust Foundation has the same powers to do so rust for JavaScript developers could get both taken down by Oracle for using JavaScript and rust foundation for using rust right like there is a real there is a real world where that happens and it literally happened and so you can see the dangers of these things right they it actually does there is real world implications for when something could get taken down now maybe it will never get taken down maybe this is all completely overreacting maybe there's absolutely no problems at all but you gotta remember the gun's still loaded it's still potential yeah if you don't know JavaScript owns Oracle you can always see this by just going to uh x.com JavaScript JavaScript conversations from Oracle debris how great is this like people have no idea that this this this product is just straight up straight up owned by Oracle anyways it's just something to think about right it's just something to think about and we should all think about these kind of things the potential legal risk without upside oh yeah we have already read this um or maybe prompted to ban EU consumption to avoid being censored uh uh considered a distributor EU project concerned about liability could put their source code off the internet what and the EU business may be forced to Halt contributions to open source projects uh cray Imperial uh Imperials vulnerable vulnerability disclosure well what uh oh oh oh oh interesting yeah the regulation would also require that vulnerabilities be disclosed to the European Union Agency for cyber security and cisia within hours of Discovery gosh that sounds awful uh whether or not a fix is available this would make it difficult to conduct coordinated disclosure where researchers give vendors time to develop security patches before vulnerabilities are disclosed publicly [Applause] my goodness this is actually the worst possible thing that could ever happen is that you have to disclose publicly vulnerabilities within hours this is actually the worst possible thing right I think anyone no matter how you feel about the law or everything we've read previously this is actually a dangerous to society this is actually the biggest danger to society which is that you make it public people abuse it dog just disclose it within the EU so that's all you can use it dude oh my goodness this would increase the chances that bad actors will develop exploits for further vulnerabilities before they are fixed putting every company that uses software at risk this would be an unfortunate outcome for Allah whose purpose is to improve software yeah I would agree with this I I don't know so that I guess that the question is this are vulnerabilities publicly available we don't know that but if that is the case that is that is hyper insane right uh we can what can we do and as I mentioned earlier this uh this is a time of of the S wait time is of the essence since the measure is moving quickly and faces a vote this week we need the community to take immediate action GitHub and other industry bodies need to publicly oppose the proposed measure EU developers and maintainers and others need to ask their European Parliament members to investigate further and bring the voices of Open Source Community to the discussion legislators need to understand the importance of collaboration the role of global developer community in driving open source Innovation open source projects underpin much of the software we use every day absolutely okay shut up sure I stream from Windows don't judge me you don't know me okay you don't know me and you don't get to just sit in here and say that to me okay you'll shut up you'll shut up chat let's just listen that deters contributor uh contributors would interfere uh with the open star Scooby-Doo's ability to maintain existing projects and deliver new software shut up I can see it moving right now shut up I can see it I can see it right there impacting the tech industry hurting the EU economy and comprising overall software security all right so let's render some judgment really quickly uh again we're taking this article at face value so I'm positive 100 since this is a even even as like agnostically to a political party as this is I am positive since this is a political item there are going to be people that are going to be very very upset please don't become a jerk okay don't do that uh if this article is true on its face value I would highly urge anybody and everybody to do exactly this right because this is really it is really important if this is truly a face value article that you wouldn't want this to be you would not want this if the outcomes are possible even if they're not enforced but just simply possible you don't want that gun laying around because the day it goes from possible to happening is a very bad day I know it's too late for one part but it's not too late for the second part so it's too late for the first part which is a July 19th right here it still has to go and be sent to the full Parliament highly recommend you actually do something useful with your life especially if you live in the EU this is your time to make a fuss about it because honestly if this is truly true and what we're seeing is really real then please take a moment do the right thing make a fuss about it um because that does sound like it's pretty shitty this would actually be pretty shitty in general for the internet um I ultimately don't want blockchain and if we somehow get the blockchain because of crappy ideas like this I'm gonna be sag okay I don't want blockchain okay I don't want everything we do to be in some slow ass Ledger that just destroys the world of gpus okay that's what I don't want that so please please please make something happen where's the Zelda where the hell is Zelda that is actually a really good joke where Zelda I really like that one hey the name is I'm not trying to be political I just simply want open source Community to be healthy and thriving and I don't want people to get liability for something they have no really liability for okay you produce software and you just want to share it with people and people use it and it ends up being bad well guess what that's how all software is it's just simply the difference between open source where I'm doing it for charity and versus commercial where I have to do it every single day where we have a whole team looking at security issues okay so you can't do that you can't just do these kind of things because that would be crazy again
