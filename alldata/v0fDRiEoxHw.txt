ladies and gentlemen welcome back to Tata steel 2023 this is the first calendar chess event of the year with prestigious players the elite players and we have been following a lot of different story lines throughout the event this is round number nine of 13. I'm going to show you five games in this recap which are nuts four which are nuts one which is played by Magnus Carlsen so obviously you would like to see it uh as always uh if you'd like to check out the full standings of the events there is a link in the description uh the event continues even if chess.com is crashing so we will begin with the Magnus Carlson game because it is our appetizer game however I'm going to tell you right now this is the most boring game of the entire recap which is crazy because we're getting it out of the way first and sometimes we don't always get a game uh let me turn on highlighted moves I was I had highlighted moves off because hello charles.com don't crash while I do my recap thank you there we go highlighted moves um so he's playing against just had a rough tournament the youngster from India uh Magnus is on a two-game winning streak after losing two games earlier in the event and we have a regosan defense and from the early opening it was actually uh the young man from India despite his not great tournament actually got a very pleasant position early castled life was good in fact started instigating with the world champion now around here I was like well you know the position has enough life in it that I'm just gonna do you know defer to Magnus Magnus is going to figure out a way so Magnus kind of ins you know pokes a little bit Bishop H4 gukesh comes back you know Knight kicks out the queen and then Magnus starts to move a random H Pawn and again when when I watch one of you guys play a move like H4 I just laugh because you guys are bozos but when Magnus plays a move like H4 I give him the benefit of the doubt I'm like wow it's Magnus H4 you know and then around here I was like oh Magnus is making progress he's he's finally starting to put some pressure on gukesha but you know what no he's not this queen it's The Rook The Rook it's the pawn like it's actually very difficult for anything to happen here the Magnus kind of looks like maybe he might be getting a little bit of something this is kind of like the only moment in the game the computer started saying no maybe White's got a little bit of an advantage here Queen B7 Queen A2 maybe Magnus gonna play H5 but kukesh stayed Rock Solid gukesh created this Pawn formation with The Rock Solid Bishop protecting the king and these are the only two pawns to fall off and one of two things is gonna happen those pawns get traded and it's a totally symmetrical position or they don't get traded and this happens Magnus trades the queens and gukesh is like all right well what about my a pawn I am now four squares away from making a queen and I was looking at this like wait seriously like what is Magnus gonna do I mean it's equal but what is Magnus gonna do Rook D5 oh and if you're wondering why I'm talking about one man left standing um you'll see you'll see that's the that's the beauty of it I'm gonna I'm gonna take you through the whole journey like I said throw me up on your living room TV and let the right you know let us go to work by the way here black is better good cash is making a draw against Magnus Carlson from a position of strength okay so Lucas could have played Rook to E7 in this position rookie 7 is what the computer wanted with the idea to trade obviously and try to just promote the pawn and play Bishop F6 um but of course white would not do that white would play the move Rook F7 we have takes we have takes but uh after A2 um that's probably gonna become a queen I mean I don't know Rook D1 if not then black is gonna get in instead gukesh I mean gukesh probably didn't even like for a second think like oh my God I gotta beat Magnus with black I'm having you know it's just life instead gukash goes here and now Magnus has to sacrifice The Rook for the bishop and force the drop now if King h8 then it's Maiden 2 which glucash did not blunder uh you might have he does not uh but uh they make a drawing I gotta tell you this was a really nice showing from gukesh uh impressive stuff he has not had a great tournament and to do this against Magnus well done absolutely well done but that's the appetizer game the next game that I have for you is from the Challenger section and we're kicking it up a notch here let the hot sauce pour all over the chessboard this game was insane the next game I will show you is guess the ELO between two grand Masters and then I'm going to show you two absolutely ridiculous games to conclude the video so don't go anywhere oh I only you know folks a lot of people complain that you know I got a lot of Magnus thumbnails in my and so on in the title but people are fascinated by Magnus and then when somebody else plays a beautiful game they're like what I don't care neither of the players just pretend this is Magnus against Magnus okay this is in reality Bhaskar and adibon very strong Indian Grandmaster and Elena rubers who's made it into like every recap Game gets wacky on move 4 as baskaran adiban plays G4 that is not a over the board Mouse slip there's a move in this position G3 to play and castle and positional game with strong beer shop no G4 the idea this and if this I want to play Rook G1 and I just I mean this is like a huge benefit for for a white because I'm gonna activate my my pieces down that side of the board so uh yeah she plays H6 which is a good move and he basically acts like nothing is wrong as if you know Rook G1 is all completely normal stuff now black generally has to play energetically uh if you're going to be playing like this black really should not take steps backwards now it's move six so she didn't make a mistake but sometimes the way the computer refutes this stuff is just to go forward like the computer does not slow down and it kind of wants to refute all of this with very active play but by going backwards you sort of give white the sense that you know you're not super sure and baskaran adiban is like the last guy you want to be defending against okay any of you ever watch uh Alvarez versus dosanos how he landed like 50 punches in a row yeah it's kind of like that all right so he trades and okay he's just opening up his Rook now throughout this game I would like you to pay attention to these two pieces okay you don't have to just stare at them that will be extremely boring but just pay attention to those two pieces okay and if you're not even watching the video you're just listening to me talk I still appreciate you because you're giving me watch time but who watches a chess video without watching the board I mean seriously what do you pretending you got a homework assignment you coding or something making something in the kitchen I mean come on guys long castles Knight bd7 H4 right A6 Bishop H3 look at White's position I mean goodness me Bishop is staring Bishop is staring Rook is staring This Is Anchored life is good you know D5 now she closes everything up and normally you would never play a move like this but Bishop takes D7 what that move looks so stupid why would you trade such a powerful piece for a night that's not moving what a dummy nope is a genius he realized that black is essentially one move away from being fine for example if you include E4 and long castles black is fine the problem is in chess one move can be the difference between winning and losing I'm sure you know that you've tried to cross 900 before and then you hung check made in one move and that was the seventh time that happened but baskaran adiba knows that he that uh his opponent wants to go here so C5 and that's a problem this right here is the uh you know the mafia coming to collect the point is that you cannot take because I take the bishop you also cannot take like this because I take this and once your Center collapses it's all over I'm getting into C6 it's really bad news I also have D6 and queen F7 mate which is a really nice way to perish um so Queen d8 back he takes takes and plays Knight E4 she has to take with the queen she decides to oh sorry sorry with the King she has to take with the King it's actually the best move which is sort of insane now she tries bringing back the bishop he doesn't stop Knight takes E5 oh my God he just sacrificed tonight because when this D6 check now the computer thought that that was actually not best it actually wanted him to play like something really weird like Knight G5 and only then try to play for D6 I got news for you this is almost an impossible to defend position with black I mean I'm I'm just saying Queen C7 this man plays Rook G5 and like what are we even looking at here it's a queen aruka rook and a knight swarming a king literally just a king just the king standing around hoping it you know his pieces wake up remember what I told you to pay attention to these two Rooks yeah rookie five it never stopped Knight G5 Bishop Rook F5 is a Full Sacrifice of a rook but that's because that's mate Knight F6 and he sacrifices The Rook because he's going to get to the F7 Square on the next move it's a miracle it's not mate I mean it's insane in this position C4 now watch as this queen performs a ritualistic Dance of Death Queen before Queen B5 Queen D5 Queen E6 Queen A5 it dances out of danger like this like this all right then like this like this like this it doesn't get it doesn't get traded it doesn't get taken that's made that's made into it's over the only thing that black can do is give a couple checks sacrifice material but after check check check check check it's mate this man bhaskaranadivan sacrificed both his Rooks this game and checkmated his young opponent with Queen Rook with Queen Knight and pawn and she never moved her Rooks I mean this was brilliant this was a spectacular game this man didn't let black move their Rook for 40 moves 40 moves you didn't even get to move your Rooks sensational unbelievable by the way you like my shirt it's new it's very soft it's a nice shirt um what a game I mean oh my God now the next game that I have for you uh is this one uh this is our guess the ELO coverage uh Vincent kaimer versus been destroying in this event now we're going to scroll through this game um it's uh We're not gonna talk too much about the opening this is like a reversed kind of like a taraj defense almost looks like a grunfeld um uh Vincent kymer is a very strong German player he recently had a medal in the speed championships uh in Kazakhstan and not the speed chess championships but rather the world rapid and Blitz very confusing aren't you ever confused about Chess titles anyway nojipek is the young guy from Uzbekistan who's been crushing uh are you bored yet I'm a little bit bored so this is essentially the game um chimer is pressuring knows your back all right nausea back has a very weak isolated Pawn kymer has this beautiful structure four pawns he will likely just try to win one of these over here and uh we're gonna get a rook and Knight end game okay so um we uh I've just received a an important message and I will have to take a look at it and um all right terrific that was very important uh we have some appliances being installed so they have just sent those to me uh terrific Rook at night end game Five Pawns uh versus uh six pawns right by uh by black that's important but the quality of these Pawns not very good just like the quality of those appliances right not very good that's why we got new ones so Knight C5 B6 and essentially kymer put a ton of pressure on nozebec he was better he was winning he was doing you know he was doing his thing but then around a move 47 he blundered he needed to play Rook A6 Force the king back and go here because after Knight F5 there is check there is King H7 there is Rook F6 and apparently he's winning after some Knight G4 jump and to attack the pawn he missed that and then his Advantage completely vanished as nodier back started coming back and trying to get a draw the problem for no direct his pawns are dumb they are not good and that was throughout the game kind of the model rookie seven is a brilliant idea King E7 Knight C6 but now we get into a rook end game of rook and 2 vs rookin 2 which not your back proceeds to blunder immediately rookie 8 rook f8 and Rook F5 and the point is that if white is able to win one of these pawns it's not necessarily winning but if white is able to win both of course it's winning two pawns versus nothing it's a win as long as they're not doubled pawns so we have D4 Rook D5 and not your back after King F3 is officially busted right he's probably just going to lose this game so now chimer plays Rook A3 we're back to B5 and apparently here the only winning idea was something like Rook H3 but even then it might be a draw I think kaimer had to do something totally different uh somewhere here Vincent had some sort of other winning idea like uh not rushing to take one of the like I think instead of Rook D5 he could have played something else like maybe Rook F4 I mean it was very very tricky um the uh commentators were showing all sorts of different stuff but even then even then after winning and drawing and winning and drawing it's it's a draw now like the end game is a draw um you might wonder why Rook F4 because King G5 and this is a fortress this is a defensive Fortress like there is no way for white to move these pawns F3 I give check and then I bring in my king it's nuts so F3 Rook A4 King H3 Rook B4 King H4 rule Cafe King G7 Rook F5 King G6 where is the winning idea where's the winning idea I don't see it King H7 Rook H5 now apparently G5 okay G5 Check Yes Rook F6 King E5 oh apparently the winning idea was something like Rook f8 spending a move doing nothing point is the king is now stuck darting this and after check here check here Rook G3 there are some winning ideas of bringing the king to G6 forcing the king away this way and playing King F5 pushing and bringing the king back and winning the king and pawn end game kaimer squeeze nods your back first like six hours not physically nobody could have complained and I think even a little bit later in this game no I think that was the last winning Chance The Players ended up agreeing to a draw because it's just Perpetual check I mean this game I don't know how noisy back survived like if noise your back once he should go drink like three beers okay uh I think he's of age even in Europe uh what a game I mean he defended so tenaciously got a feel for kymer I mean you really you just have to it was so close uh and if you had the patience to make it uh this far folks um so uh yeah here we go uh the first thing that we will look at is this game between dingly Wren and Anish giri so ding begins with a ready a very boring opening an opening that really a knee already like not even a neocadland type of thing all right D4 E3 oh but this game got crazy he dangly Wren played F4 and then a few moves later dingley Wren played the move G4 oh he going he going to battle dingly Wren has the hands of four ounce gloves Biting Down on the mouthpiece he's like I gotta put this man away G4 gives away the pawn G5 forces the Knight back position opens up now ding has Queen C2 and he's gonna bring his Knight back to B1 and play Knight C3 now in this position for the life of me I don't understand things next move like Dingus 2800 and we will get into why Magnus is the last one standing I promise it's it's part of what I said you just played Knight B1 A5 has played why would you not finish this journey the computer loves it too it thinks that the Knight should just go to but ding acknowledges the potential problem of a 5a4 and goes here but that gives a niche time one move as we've talked about in this recap boom boom boom and then boom and then boom oh my goodness and Anish has created a total barrier he's created a peace force field if you will and it's like impossible to do anything now in fact he's actually creating counter play this is nuts if ding had laid Knight to C3 right away there wouldn't have been any boom there wouldn't have been any Bishop trade you couldn't have played Knight F5 because if you play Knight F5 I just take the Knight so I'm actually I have no clue what ding didn't like about this move maybe there was Knight B6 ideas to try to play A4 but then Knight D5 and then maybe this Knight is just a god and that's like a that's like an understatement but ding played a little too slowly and suddenly a niche Anish is doing things to players in this event he has never done before not like that all right he's got a wife relax I'm talking on the chessboard Knight E3 Anish has never played chess like this violent counter-attacking like he has it in him but he's like a you know he likes to massage a position a lot of weird references today so very complicated game his pieces are on the background ding's still trying to like kick these pieces around Knight F4 and my man in each giri says you think you're the boss of me Bishop C4 and the idea is that obviously if B takes I take I get this you're gonna run out of pieces ding decides Rook ff2 I'm not taking the bishop what anisha's like all right I'm gonna back up I need she's like I'm up two pawns bro he said I got six you got four you gotta mate me right now Knight H5 Rook D5 didn't goes for it Anish meets him at the top all right B6 Rock Solid and now I've got Bishop B7 on the way danger decides to jump in Knight F6 and Anish says let me take that horse and now allow me ding Knight F3 his Rook is hanging but the Knight comes in with check the King is worth more than the Knight and the Rook combined everything can take but it doesn't matter because after this rookie one check and Bishop F1 King h8 now in this position black also could have taken but King h8 is a beautiful opening of the G file for the final attack and dingly ren resigns that's unbelievable stuff just wow wow oh my oh my Anish is in second place with another big win and the final game of today's recap was was violent if your kids are watching you may want to have them look away it was a nimso Indian defense between Arjun eragisi and Richard report Knight E2 oh my goodness there's like a fly in the room a lot of distractions today Knight E2 all right Bishop B7 we have a trade a little bit of a boring opening but not for long what what is the queen doing there well I'll tell you what the queen is doing there it's instigating the queen is just hanging out here like yeah anybody want to mess with me and uh ever guys is like no not really nope Queen D2 and I'm just gonna Castle along and reports like you are okay well I'm going to start an attack over here then and every guy sees like all right well H3 I'm not really worried of G4 I'll always be able to take and get my Rook out so yeah Richard what are you doing Richard like G8 and suddenly Eric icy looked at this position and went no but actually seriously what do I do like I'm struggling to move any of my pawns I cannot take because of this if I play Bishop B2 I hang this Pawn if I play Rook G1 he takes what do I do I can't move any pieces so he plays Queenie too I mean he's lucky black is really not threatening a whole lot yet right okay so black brings his Knight out and every guy says like no but too I can't move anything like this is what is happening how do I have no moves Queenie one report takes the pawn now you cannot go here because your Rook is hanging so before you go there your attack is Queen guy moves his Queen takes and castles and again what does white do report played one of the weirdest openings I have ever seen ever and he just froze the white pieces like none of these pawns are moving forward because every single one is a drastic weakening of the position Knight C5 potentially right and so on so upon realizing that he basically can't push any pawns or move any pieces instead of playing the Absurd computer move H4 which I could not be paid any sum of money to explain to you um Arjun plays Rook G4 because he tries to get rid of the bishop and he gets so swiftly and brutally punished for trying to stand up to the position observe F5 he he hasn't wanted to take this because black would get total control of the g-file but now he has no choice his only other alternative is to go back so he does this and now he plays H4 and his idea must have been well if report takes I will trade and I will be a pawn down but I have chances after H4 report played Rook G2 and then he played F4 then he took and you cannot go here because this and when this happened Rook C2 check and Eric geise resigned we very rarely see games like this at the high 2700 level um report played in such an obscure way with all of this stuff Queen H4 those what is that move like why not just develop your night and castle and then what is G5 report is a chess alien From Another Dimension and when everything goes right in his games they are so brutal but so beautiful he plays all of these moves that look like they don't make any sense at all and suddenly he's up a pawn and suddenly his pieces force all of the white pieces to the first Rank and Rook C2 the kiss of death and Report wins what a game I mean what the heck what was this this was nuts completely nuts oh wow that concludes round number nine and um I told you that at the end of the recap I would tell you why there's one man left standing after dingley wren's most recent loss these are the updated ratings of the 2800 Club Magnus Carlson is now the only chess player remaining on the planet with a classical rating over 2 800 dingly run has lost nearly 14 points in this event after the loss Magnus has lost some too but he's 28.50 still so there you go and look at how close it is between 18 and like nine nine spots separated by like 18 points and you see nudgerbeck is coming up and up so I'll see you in tomorrow's recap get out of here
