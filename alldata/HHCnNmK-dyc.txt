ladies and gentlemen I am currently participating in an event that is being organized on chess.com known as the team chess battles and the team chess battles are basically legalized chess cheating it's two on two chess you play a 10-minute rapid game against a set of opponents you get 10 seconds bonus per moove you play a two-game mini match and if it's tied 111 you break it with an Armageddon most teams are even matched and this is the semi-final matchup where my team which is composed of myself and Grandmaster hiar Nakamura took on the best power play of Chess commentators debatable but most people agree uh in the world which is Daniel nitzki and Robert hess uh they defeated Peter Sidler and Jan Gustafson and we defeated Eric Hansen and Jordan van forest and this legalized cheating type typ of protocol is actually quite fascinating it's very interesting to see how evenly matched teams uh evenly uh composed teams talk about their moves and uh how teams like myself and hikaro have a big rating disparity how we uh go through the moves as well and you uh have really enjoyed this format and uh have really enjoyed watching it live and in this video I'm going to take you through the recap uh of our semi-final match so we were playing uh with the black pieces for game number one and uh I was playing uh I was controlling the mouse and so was Robert and that's why he uh is uh his username is listed there and I had a feeling they were going to open with E4 uh and I mean they play a lot of stuff Robert plays E4 C4 uh I mean they could play whatever I actually thought that maybe they would play a Joe Bava London with Knight C3 Bishop F4 cuz da is quite good at this but they went for E4 I think they anticipated we would probably play the caroan and we did uh and uh then after D4 D5 they played Knight C3 now in the previous match um there was a two nights caroan and we played D5 and we ultimately held a very solid game and generally in this format you'd like to hold with black and play to win with white which is what you do at all the levels so uh Knight C3 takes takes and here hikaro and I had a conversation uh whether to play Bishop F5 uh or whether to play Knight to F6 Bishop F5 is a classical Mainline I have played hundreds and hundreds of games uh the theory here is very long white Retreats chases you away then puts a knight on F3 black can allow the Knight here or not allow the Knight there lot of theory but recently I've been playing Knight F6 and hikaro was okay going for Knight F6 uh in particular because he um he wanted to investigate this position a little bit the Tara raro Khan where black has doubled pawns very weird structure black goes here castles Etc there's another line here known as the brunin Larsson but uh as Hikaru confirmed in our game yesterday uh he this is basically terrible for long games like 90minut and top level chess but it's a perfectly good line for like 22200 and below and it's not the worst in in Blitz and Rapid but you damage your structure and black just gets a eh you know uh slightly worse position so Pawn takes F6 now white plays C3 we develop the bishop so do they and now they go for the main line which is Queen C2 uh attacking our Pawn on H7 historically in this position after giving this check and white blocking like this white blocks with the Knight because otherwise we would have put our Bishop on G4 targeting their Knight this is all the main line so at the highest level this has been played many times and now white has an attack on this Pawn now the most natural move here by far is either H6 or G6 and then White Castles you play Knight D7 and this this is a very solid setup for Black but generally you know white is microscopically better but recently one of the trendy and edgy ways to play this line is to play H5 this has become really popular in the last like 3 to 5 years it looks really idiotic to send the pawn forward like this I mean you you castled you really don't want to do that and not only that you actually send the pawn to H4 as well which is really bogus but the engine actually says it's not half bad and um white also has the option to Castle long so after Bishop E3 Knight D7 long castles is another way to play and then what you basically do is you get into a huge fight but this is if white is looking for a fight and this is if white is looking for a wrestling match which is also a fight but with no striking so you know slightly less blood and violence now here what was funny is I was talking to hikaro during the commentary during the match and I said you know there's a line here that's very annoying which is Knight F4 and then white uses a backwards Queen maneuver to get the queen to H5 very annoying line it's like the most annoying line uh that that can happen here and the boys thought for 40 seconds and they played Knight F4 I was very disappointed to see this move uh because the thing is if white waits to play Knight F4 you know you can even play Queen C7 and uh in many lines the Knight doesn't get to F4 and okay you get into like a very you know complex battle they went Knight F4 and then they went Queen D1 and you know this kind of shows that I'm not on the level of nitki and hes or obviously Hikaru but from an openings perspective I know my openings and I know you know I know what's trendy I know what's popular I know what does well and here they played a a a line where and Karo and I calculated here uh that going Queen C7 is probably wrong because we were very concerned with just a very simple g3 at which point we can't really take because then they're going to get the bishop here which is very good uh and also we kind of didn't want to take the pawn because then they open up their Rook so there's no reason to help them uh and now in this position Hikaru uh told me that there's a line that he vaguely remembers in his notes where black gives up a pawn and kills all of White's winning chances and I found that pretty funny um so basically I I would never play this and this kind of shows the level difference between me and a top three player in the world in this position I would play Queen C7 attacking the Knight white would play G3 and I would figure something out like I would play Bishop D7 and then you know white would play Bishop D2 and then and then I don't know we would play chess Hikaru here was like you can take the Knight and then you can give away a pawn you can play Knight to G6 and we just hold now I would never in a million years do this ever ever and yet the computer blesses it and white has no winning chances no winning chances is a strong statement but for an engine like perspective black wants to play H3 weakening White's light squares and then maybe even Queen D5 to create mating threats so and and and just so you're aware like this looks scary but it's not and we can always trade the queen we can always kick this queen out so there's nothing there and hikaro was like yeah we can just play like this and white is completely uh hopeless in terms of winning chances like I said I would have never in a million years played like this queen F5 takes takes A4 we bring the king we trade Rooks and now they're going to try to beat us in this end game so they they are up a pawn they are doing what's called fixing our structure with a flank Pawn they want to play Rook A4 and now the boys you know put the Rook on B4 and put it on B6 this is very instructive Rook A4 Rook B4 Rook B6 planting firmly here and basically it's a question of will white be able to knock down some of our uh bowling pins of Pawns right so Bishop C4 they play B3 we go back they play C4 hikaro here was looking for a defensive setup and this is sort of the the defensive setup that we landed on it's very difficult for them to move their pawns forward it's difficult for them to move their King but this was maybe the biggest advantage of of the game that they had apparently they needed to play here allowing our Rook to the open file repositioning the bishop and just allowing this which was tough for them to do instead they went for a pawn break and as it just so turns out they can't make any progress and the most important thing is that the opposite colored Bishop endgame is the draw so Bishop D2 Bishop E4 but this was anything but over da and hes got down to 25 seconds and allowed us to get some pretty active counterplay with our rook and here he Caro was like we're going to win this game like we're playing the win we're going to put our Rook on C2 we're going to take this pawn and take this pawn and start manifesting it and then apparently Robert hes with the Call of the batch Bishop E1 played with 4 seconds on the clock they played this move with four seconds because they gained 10 seconds and Bishop E1 is designed to get out of this check and attack our strong Pawn if we can take and then take this pawn and survive we're going to have good winning chances but Bishop E1 is a fantastic move getting out of the way to Target this pawn and now unfortunately the game is simply going to end in a draw but it's anything but over they they have two pass pawns right they have two pass pawns on on on on the open board we have a very powerful F Pawn but now we have to make sure their King doesn't get in to help if they start pushing both pawns at the same time and then their King gets in over here and takes this we're going to be in bad shape so all of a sudden we start shuffling and both sides are below 30 seconds Bishop F5 right King D5 we're we're protecting the king the pawn has made it very far so now our Bishop is stuck on this diagonal we cannot let the king in so their King starts going the other way they definitely are very very close to getting a winning Advantage here but we stop them just in time so we stop them so the king can't get in it's now past 60 moves and at some point they're going to have to give away one of their pawns to make any progress their Bishop is stuck Bishop H7 uh and uh right here they give up the pawn so we take take and this is instructive because what our Bishop can do is defend the pawn and our King can run to create a fortress uh there's another drawing technique here which is a little bit more dank but we do this and uh we put the King on H7 and now they cannot break through so a long hard fought first game we Shuffle Shuffle Shuffle but this is a defensive Fortress and this ends after 120 moves a draw in the first game a a closed game but the caracon prevails solid draw they they played in a in a in a very annoying way they played literally the most cuttingedge maneuver which is Knight F4 Queen D1 the computer doesn't say you know we have to go for this but it was practical and even though we were under slight pressure it's very funny like the way that Hikaru handles uh these types of positions so I was completely confident the match was over I did not have this level of confidence in the first match that we played against Jordan and and Eric but I was confident I even knew what they were going to play I predicted it I uh I figured nitki was going to push them toward a Kings Indian defense that's probably the opening that he knows best uh and that's exactly what happened I played C4 uh and and I told you know we we could play D4 C4 he you know C4 they went Knight F6 and G6 the only opening you kind of have to prevent is D5 uh so I played E4 and then we went for a Kings Indian now there are many many many lines in the Kings Indian defense uh and I Hikaru gave me the option to go for the four pawns attack which is very aggressive uh versus something a little bit more positional but with some Venom which is H3 Bishop E3 this is known as the ma makov makov uh one of those and the simple idea of this line is that you want to lock the center and then black wants to put a knight on C5 and what you do is you play G4 Knight A6 Knight E2 Knight C5 Knight G3 you play like this and then you develop this bishop and you attack black with your pawns very complicated uh they played they played C6 and this allows us to still go for G4 but hikaro made the point that G4 is less good if they never played E5 which is very instructive like this is the fascinating thing about just having knowledge as a 2800 level player he said if you go G4 they might change the plan and if you play like Bishop G2 they're going to go B5 cuz you actually destabilize the pawn here fascinating like AB absolutely fascinating because this is such a weird way to play the Kings Indian but it is there so we switched it back to a more traditional setup they went for E5 and then D5 this is this is the King's Indian right here black is going to move this Knight and play for F5 all right however normally this Knight is over there like in the traditional Kings Indian uh I'm just going to you know very I'm just going to say like Knight C6 D5 Knight E7 like that is where the Knight is and then this Knight gets out of the way or goes forward and then that Knight participates in the attack but the way it is in the game the Black Knight is on A6 so it's over here right so they start coming at us with Knight H5 and obviously trying to put the Knight on F4 and they want to play F5 we Castle Knight F4 and now we can get the bishop out of the way like this and then play A3 B4 but then this Knight is kind of strong you know what I mean and some of you may be wondering why not this well that helps their Bishop right we would never do that because we have a bunch of Pawns on light squares so our light squared Bishop is uh is the one that's supposed to be traded not the dark squared Bishop so we played A3 I thought listen you know I I asked tar A3 whatever you know are we going to move the bishop A3 seems fine because our Bishop is pretty bad and now we just activate Our Queen and basically if black doesn't play F5 they're going to lose so like if they don't play F5 if they wait we're going to maybe even open the position and just right away Target this pawn and their position falls apart like the Kings Indian hangs on a knife's Edge at all times so if they if they if they lock the position then we're going to play for B4 and try to knock down the queen side so basically they have to play at five at some point now if they play at5 right away they run the risk of Us opening that Center they didn't like that so they locked the center of the position right now this is completely locked F5 is coming and in the Kings Indian defense an experienced player with white knows how to defend them elves at all times if you give Black Card Blan right if black gets F5 let's say white just shuffles back and forth what black is looking for is F4 okay then they're looking for G5 okay then they're looking for H5 and then they're looking for this that is what black wants then they will come behind those pieces the bishop is the most important piece for the black attack the light squar Bishop in the Kings Indian if black tries to launch an attack without the light squ Bishop let's just very ID idiotic but let me just say something like this and then tries to play like like an attack you know with this oh this is this is hopeless you have two many problems in the position it's very instructive okay and so we got out of this by creating a defensive cocoon Knight to D2 and we meet F5 and it's very important in the Kings Indian you meet F5 with F3 there is another way I mean we we could blow up the position completely this is another way to play but it's wrong because for example black can play uh G5 you know black can you know against Bishop F4 black can play G5 right and then F4 and try to wall Us in so instead of getting involved in that we play F3 allow this but now we we slide back and if black just gets as many moves as they want in a row they're going to win they're going to completely March our King down with the help of this sniper from the corner but we have an idea and the idea if you've never seen this before looks so barbaric looks so dumb it looks so not classy the idea to get out of this attack is to play Rook to B1 what it's to attack on the other side of the board H but but they're arriving I mean we we are moments away from mate no the idea is to play B4 but it's to walk the king out of the king side and because the center is so locked the king is actually safe on E2 and the thing is Black's entire position is hinging on whether or not G4 will actually pose problems for white so they went Rook F6 we played King E2 we finished our journey we are waiting for them to play the move G4 right and then we have a decision they can't do it now because after take take we would play here and we would win the game right but that is the idea will G4 work they play Rook H6 and now they're ready to go G4 and we have to be careful because after G4 take take they are posing some problems like if we start doing this they're going to play G3 they're going to play Queen H4 Queen H1 and we're not going to be able to defend the base of our Pawn chain we're going to be in a lot of trouble so we do have to be a little careful now that we walked our King to the center we're ready to meet this move G4 and I thought we're up two minutes they're literally falling directly into our trap we have set them this trap of forcing them into a position but the game is going to be pretty easy and we're going to launch an attack on this side of the board so Play Bishop D7 all right and now we had a thought here okay we can play Rook B1 we can play for B4 okay but then they're going to meet us with B6 and Hikaru and I kind of aligned here on a wavelength he he suggested this idea but I but I was going to suggest it myself as well there is an idea in among all of this where you don't wait for G4 you play it yourself call an ambulence but not for me and the point is if the position locks like if black goes here here look what happens to the eval if after G4 let's go back a couple moves if black plays H4 the game is almost over because you just go back and that's it and for the rest of the game you are defending an onslaught on your queen side black officially cannot get through you put the King on G2 he takes a nap for the rest of the game and then the the other pieces go to the queen side so we played Rook G1 now again you might be confused like what the point is but we are setting up a Counterattack with the G Pawn that is what we're setting up and right here I was maximum confident I was like we are absolutely winning this game because black has nothing like Black's major plan is going G4 and now we're doing it back to them that's it and I thought easy p easy like we have officially refuted the entire Kings India like all of the set of the ideas everything G4 we're coming right back down and they have to do something they take on pant but they take on pant and now we have the G file so now the G Pawn That was supposed to come down is in our line of sight so we are going to play Rook G1 Bishop E3 we can play H4 in some positions right and now here they spent 3 minutes if my confidence wasn't high enough already up 2 and A2 minutes with an improv position right they went Rook G6 so that Rook that they brought over that they brought back they have 126 on the clock and we have 649 and they still remain with one idea and so remember everything that I've told you already Black's most important piece in this position is the light scored Bishop so we're looking at ideas like Knight B5 we're looking at ideas to get the bishop we're looking at ideas like Knight D1 Knight E3 Knight F5 put the Knight on F5 trade it put this KN on e4 the light squares once we get rid of that light squared Bishop for black because this night is so bad our light squares are going to be million dollars right Rook G1 we're going to put pressure here we're going to win that pawn we're going to get a knight to F5 we're going to open up the center so we played Knight D1 now we spent a lot of time on Knight D1 we were considering a lot of things we were looking at Rook G1 but we went with Knight D1 probably should have played it a little bit faster right but Knight D1 they went Rook f8 they have 115 on the clock and we go for Knight E3 and they go to Knight C7 they're now down under a minute so their idea is B5 that is basically the remaining idea of the black position try to create counterplay on the queen side and at this point Hikaru was saying just play Knight F5 like we can play Knight F5 right away it actually doesn't matter that we are going to lose a Pawn the idea is Knight F5 Bishop takes Pawn takes take take take and we can play like Rook G1 but the point is we play Knight E4 so black creates counterplay we play B3 and then we will get a knight to E4 and just in an Essence this is the position that we're going for okay and we have pressure on this Pawn this pawn and this pawn and we basically can't lose right like if we play Knight F5 and we we trade a bunch of pieces we're trading a lot of material but black is stuck black is playing very defensively there might be a G4 in here okay like G4 and and uh Etc like that that is the line that we are essentially going for take take take uh we can play like for Knight E4 we can play Rook G1 like these are you know these are our ideas uh that we are trying to accomplish in in the position and if they could play for G4 and you know we we we trade all the Rooks and this and you know we have Knight takes D6 Etc like that was the idea the idea was to play Knight to F5 and I said Knight F5 looks good is there Rook G1 as well like do we have you know can we play Rook G1 or Knight F5 does it really matter like can we keep more pieces on the board uh we talked about it and he Carl was like look it's your call you can play Knight F5 you can play Rook G1 and I thought Knight F5 was for me for my level I was like I don't want to trade that many pieces because they have a minute on the clock so why don't we stay up 2 minutes 2 to 3 minutes with more pieces on the board they create the counterplay and now we play Rook to G4 now we could play Rook 3 G2 as well but that loses a pawn but the idea is we're going to sacrifice The Rook because what why why why else do we exist on Planet Earth we sacrifice The Rook take like this put a knight on F5 go to the B file how does black ever make a move we play Rook B8 Knight F5 how is black ever going to deal with this Knight now the engine is always saying it's slightly worse but keep in mind black is up two points of material and it's minus5 so we have a lot of compensation and they have 30 seconds and we're going to play Rook B1 get in our Queen get in our Knight get in our Knight like this and we're going to terrorize the black position so they go back to play defense we put the Rook on the open file Bishop to E3 to point at the pawn while our King is always going to monitor the H Pawn knight8 Rook B5 trying to get a trade we could repeat moves we play Queen C3 we're slowly inching our way forward Queen uhoh uhoh look at that we're sniping the light squares they play King F7 we slide over to the pawn Rook goes back to G8 now we trade and we get in with the queen maybe The Rook trade was a little bit rushed but it has to happen at some point and now here comes our Knight Rook h8 King G1 Rook H7 they're coming up with a nice defensive idea the computer here finds Queen D7 fine Knight A5 Queen C8 we don't go for a queen trade now we're better this was the game plan the game plan was look at their position they can't move anything so we are going to sneak and SL and and slip in and Rook C7 and and King H right we're waiting Knight C6 King F6 This is Our Moment in this position apparently if we had retreated the bishop they are really struggling to make a move if they play something like Rook B7 trying to create counterplay we have Queen A5 and the idea is that if they take the pawn on C4 we come back with the queen and we go after the pawn on G5 because it's impossible to protect so it actually worked like our shuffling our lulling them into a kind of a snooze worked but instead of going on for the G5 pawn and playing Bishop C1 is very tough we went on the queen side and suddenly they Consolidated and they're creating counterplay of their own look at this defensive move Knight B8 we take take the queen they take the queen we take this pawn and in this position we gave them a check and the game ends with a repetition of moves King F7 Knight D6 King F6 Knight E8 King F7 but in this position they play this with one second on the clock Daniel and Robert played King f8 and gained 10 seconds with 1 second remaining on the clock we took the pawn and now only the Chaz Gods will know what's going to happen they have a rook a past H Pawn and a knight ready to attack our King we have two knights and two connected past pawns ready to attack their King and it's just a scramble they go Knight C2 we get the Knight over to F5 they play Knight D4 we could have ventured into F7 but that seemed kind of nuts like it seemed nuts to leave our our King like this but apparently if we go after the pawn on G5 it it actually covers a lot of squares so yeah I mean kind of tough to play like this King E7 looks really strong but we're getting our pawns there and yeah I mean it's just a tough position so Knight F5 they go Knight D4 and we push the pawn we're now two squares away from queening but after a series of checks and they they can repeat moves again they don't they played that move with two seconds on the clock this time D7 the thing is we're sort of at their Mercy like if they want to make a draw cuz they have the rug they can we're just going to play for a win so King F2 and again they don't play for the draw they play Rook D2 so now we start pushing some pawns King H1 Rook D1 check again they can make a draw but they play Knight F4 their Rook monitors the pawn and there is no easy way for us to kind of block the path here so Knight E3 we trade Knights Knight takes e takes the Rook has been disconnected from the pawn but the pawns are doubled and the king is monitoring them both so we threaten the pawn on C5 they go after our Pawn we defend we repeat again and now Rook to E2 is a draw they push the H Pawn they push the H Pawn again and now we're stuck now apparently in this position uh after they played H3 uh in here maybe we could have taken on C5 taken on C5 went for something like Knight E6 or Knight but the thing is it's it's very tough like it's very tough to understand what you are trying to accomplish here because you're going to lose pawns on both sides of the board so like Rook C5 Rook A5 and this Pawn might become a queen it's very tough and because our pawns are spread out so far you know it's very difficult for us to defend our position they force our King into a corner and now only our Knight can move so we start giving up a pawn G5 but here they find the killer Blow instead of Knight D3 uh after Knight D3 they find F3 and it looks like they can't make any progress how are they going to they can't move the pawn they can't give us a check but as it turns out they have F2 and that is uh that is unfortunate because the Rook is hanging but the king cannot stop both pawns this close to queening and so they Queen they Queen it's a fork they're picking up our Knight all of our pawns are for not and unfortunately in this position or fortunately depending on who you're cheering for uh we had to resign and uh Daniel nitki and Robert hes moved on to the team chess battle finals and they will face Fabiano Carana the world number two and and candidate uh and Christian Cilla now where did this go wrong um it's very tough to say I mean this end game was very unpredictable with 30 seconds on the clock or maybe here maybe here we just had to go immediately for these pawns uh rather than playing Knight F5 like Knight F5 might have been a little bit too defensive um maybe we should have went Knight F7 Knight G5 like maybe we should have just gone Pawn hunting and then yeah then this is very scary because now we have three pass pawns four pass pawns right like this is actually very very different situation we might have still lost this game but I think that was probably the final moment because we put a knight on F5 instead they just kind of were able to bully us with their uh combo of three pieces and this is kind of a nightmare position no pun intended with Knight pawn pawn and Rook uh maybe an engine holds this but as strong as hikaro is unfortunately he is a no computer but in reality where we let our foot off the gas was this moment right here uh and you know I take responsibility for this because as I've said throughout this event it's kind of weird being me because I could just sit there and let Hikaru tell me all the moves and throughout our five games that we played in this event I tried not to do that I mean if hikaro was like 100% certain of a move I would play it but here he did leave the door open for either Knight F5 or Rook G1 and hikaro was saying like he probably should have overruled the Rook G1 idea and said no no Knight F5 is better because it completely kills Black's counterplay and it's just a very practical decision we go up on down but we have lifetime pressure against Black's position and we're just in good shape and uh yeah that's that's my bad I mean I made the mistake but that's why it's team chess battles right like we're a team and uh I'm not as good as my teammate which is but he's really good so uh hikaro would have went KN F5 in a game and and probably put the pressure on with white and and and ended up winning but uh I didn't want to trade that many pieces I thought we had a major time Advantage so uh I actually was very happy with the Rook sacrifice and you know I got to tell you we got a pretty damn good position like this position looks really good for white but unfortunately we did not find this bishop C1 back idea and um yeah that's uh that's sort of how it goes but legalized uh cheating for me uh event is over it was a lot of fun I learned a lot and I hope you all enjoyed and um I look forward to the final match so all the best to all the competitors get out of here
