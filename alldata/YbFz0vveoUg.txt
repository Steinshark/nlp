not recommended however I was confident myself now the first thing that you can see here that looks suspicious is what it's the fact that my opponent's got a mittens profile photo mittens of course being the chess bot now I thought alright that looks a a little bit weird and my opponent's rated 2700 with no title so I clicked on my opponent's profile and I saw that it was made pretty recently something like one or two months ago and it had a really big win rate but that doesn't really tell me a whole lot of information so let's see how the game is gonna go now my opponent played a French defense and in this position any normal 2700 rated player plays this setup in some capacity my opponent took so I was like what that's not a move black just completely locks the center up has no pressure on the center and white is a bit better now when I get paired against an individual who I am suspicious about a couple of things happen sometimes they just don't cheat against me because they see that it's me sometimes they don't cheat in the opening they just get a terrible position and then they start defending it that's also another way right a lot of weird things happen with their move time so in the early stages my opponent was just immediately worse from the the get-go like playing very odd I played Queen G4 immediately taking advantage of this now my opponent played King f8 and what a lot of cheaters will do is they will throw the evaluation very early in the game because what that means is they have to play catch-up and their accuracy score is already affected so you know they think that they're gonna game the algorithm so I played Knight F3 my opponent played a move here that is just absolutely deranged like no 2700 on the planet would play this move and that move is Bishop takes C3 that is a crazy move why would you give up a bishop your only active piece and open up a full line of attack toward your own King well because this is not a human at all this is not a human whatsoever now my opponent goes here I develop my Bishop I mean just look at this position right this position is just absolutely incredible Queen C7 back now what what is this so what do I do here I can Castle I decide I'm gonna I'm gonna go for Glory right what does my opponent do plays a move on the other side of the board B6 now of course white is better but there's no clear plan for a win so I try to take as much space as possible my opponent does this and now I play Rook H3 with the intention of playing this but here's the thing even if I'm a very good Blitz player which at this point is 2700 and I have a very good position I'm still a human and when met with really good defensive resistance uh I will suffer right so my opponent goes Knight F5 and I rotate my queen now this is already the start of an inaccuracy apparently here I should just walk my king to G1 first I go Queen F4 setting up the idea of G4 now at this position my opponent lays Bishop to B7 still completely not acknowledging my threads I was like what what about G4 so I do everything right everything in this position seems to be going swimmingly I'm actually playing like an engine because my opponent has given me such an early lead but all of a sudden it all changed and this is what I'm saying cheaters sometimes will let you get out to an early lead and suddenly the defensive measures start kicking in now in this position I should play this or this I try to trade the Knight off my opponent drops back their Knight to F5 and kind of phase three of cheating activates which is not always playing the top engine move it's not always going to be the top computer move for example the top computer move in this position at my depth of stockfish is to play HG and then trade the Queens right but they might be using a different engine or they might be using a different depth so they play Knight E7 and I just keep trying to March forward with the move G6 all right now as it turned out in this game it looked like my opponent seemingly was trying to play the second line of the engine and the third line not the first line in this position my opponent completely ignored what I was trying to do and played A5 I was like A5 what on Earth is A5 all right and I thought well everything's everything's going quite well so I decided I'm gonna walk my king to F1 now to get out of the way of all this and I just had one inaccuracy all right just one inaccuracy which was walking my king out this way because now my opponent can trade the bishop off and I lose one of my kind of key attacking pieces and and things are sort of uh petering out instead of King F1 apparently I should have played Rook G3 to continue to apply pressure you cannot take Queen F7 like I said my opponent let me get out to a lead this is what they do sometimes all right and some sometimes they sometimes they lose games cheaters don't cheat necessarily every single game so I thought well I'm gonna play King F1 now Bishop A6 I'm like all right I'm gonna trade the Bishops and I'm gonna keep attacking and as you can see I made two inaccuracies in this game and all of my advantage disappeared which is sort of how it goes sometimes my advantage is gone uh because of Knight H4 by the way I just want to draw your attention to something my opponent just played Bishop A6 right I took on A6 the only move that my opponent has in the considering my opponent's last move was A5 followed by trading the bishop in this position my opponent spent eight seconds eight seconds on Rook takes A6 what what other move do you have bro Rook A6 gf7 my opponent trades and in this position if you gave this situation on the board right now to any 2700 after Knight H4 Rook H4 you said make a move they would play Knight F5 in five seconds three seconds nine to five replace the Knight hit the pawn light squared blockade blocking everything and my opponent spends 16 seconds on that move with 50 seconds on the clock what what so I moved my Rook out of the way here comes A4 all right trying to uh Advance on the queen side a little bit I play King G1 getting my king out of the way opponent infiltrates on the light squares gets their Rook out on f8 King walks out Queen infiltrates Queen takes H5 and uh G5 there a nice little move you know restricting me back uh and here my opponent lost on time in this position actually with 1.7 seconds on the clock I disrespected this individual and sacrificed my queen uh because I knew that I would be winning on time now I was look I was suspicious and I thought well maybe this person's not cheating uh maybe maybe I don't know right but I was a little suspect anyway I reported this person and they were banned all right you could see there it says account closed I don't determine who gets banned but then I went through their profile and I went through their profile and the first thing that I saw was the game before the game against me this dude played another guy and they both got banned for cheating this is incredible stuff this is groundbreaking stuff two cheaters going toe-to-toe and then cheater 2 played another cheater a few games before that this is incredible we get two games of all the opponents getting banned this is spectacular stuff now this game was wild so it started out with an Italian and white played castles which is an inaccurate move order but like I said cheaters have a variety of ways of cheating sometimes they don't cheat every game some games they don't they only play on their own sometimes they only cheat after move 10 alright sometimes right like they they don't they don't they don't cheat every game they don't cheat every move 94 played and this individual decides to go for a Gambit now keep in mind cheater one does not know they're playing cheater too they just know that they're cheater one so white gets this position and is now going to kind of use the open space on the board to get the pawn back and make black feel the pressure black plays the top engine move which is H6 not developing a piece nothing H6 Queen D5 threatens mate black plays top engine move Queen F6 white plays Rook to E1 black plays D6 but okay none of these moves are impressive right black is just playing defensively alright none of these moves are impressive that move was played in one second this was played in two seconds one second one second right black is playing very quickly now in this position white plays Knight D4 what so if you take like this I'm gonna weaken your king take this and that's weak right so Knight D4 so what is the only way for black to deal with all of this pressure oh to uh Blitz out the only move which is Knight d8 in two seconds volunteering your king to move but defending B7 white plays not Bishop takes D7 which is the top engine move but the second line of the engine F4 applying more pressure to the E5 Pawn but wait a minute black black now has C6 played in two seconds the top engine move in two seconds wait that's it white is losing because Queen and Bishop are forked no fe5 top engine move counter-attacking the queen black seeing all this doesn't take the queen or the pawn bolts the queen out of the way in two seconds two seconds spent on that move Now The Rook is hit the queen is hanging and the bishop is hanging surely the game is over G3 by white now only move Queen back to what why did the why didn't the queen just also in three seconds what is happening how is black finding all of these absurd defensive resources folks it gets even crazier white plays E6 top engine move that loses a pawn four different ways I know but now you have check black plays Queen F7 best move white plays top engine move Bishop back to E2 to defend the queen and black plays top engine move G6 the queen bolts across the board what what the robotic nonsense black ass shrink now black starts lashing out E5 attacking the Knight the Knight moves back black activates the bishop on F5 and attacks the pawn it's very awkward to defend this so white pins the bishop to the queen black rotates the queen out of the way in three seconds the best move once again Bishop develops now black has a couple of things that they can do here right uh black can kick the queen out once again somehow uh black and centralized denied black and develop the bishop and castle one way or another no black in two seconds plays the top engine move which is just launch an attack from the current position H5 Rook D1 oh yeah tremendous Bishop C2 wait wait wait wait wait why didn't the computer Play Bishop C2 in this position ah because it's not the top computer move and if you play it now I'll go rookie one so I waited for you to go here and now I'm gonna take and now I'm just gonna go back and remember how I played H5 which was clearly to play H4 yeah I'm not gonna play H4 I'm playing this because now that's the top engine move okay white plays C4 yeah black shots that down real quick in three seconds with C5 nope uh White plays H4 black activates tonight and between these two things where should black Castle right where's the black castle of course you don't want to Castle this way because you've already pushed the pawns and it's clear you want to attack your opponent and you've got some space here and while the queen is close to you here it obviously makes more sense to go this way because you've got all the support so black Castle short because that's the top engine move and black does that in one second Bishop F3 Bishop infiltrates on D3 that's also the top engine move and white starts panicking sacrificing material by the way King to H2 was the third line of the engine that's why white played it take take King G7 is the king G7 right so you have a queen Knight Bishop Rook rook in seven pawns but you move your king in two seconds because top engine move Queen back to A4 A6 Knight infiltrates on D4 takes takes and uh Rook F5 brings The Rook and in this position black delivers the kiss of death as the white position completely falls apart G5 pushing the Pawns in front of the king that you castle that way because he was gonna be safe Bishop comes in and black just cross forward with Queen E6 and white resigns or loses on time black played this game uh with an accuracy score up I think 98.6 the last time I checked see black is not what we call an intelligent cheater black cheated every move and uh played the top line of the engine every move that's how you know that's like not yeah so black play blackout is a game zero zero zero zero no inaccuracies no mistakes no misses no blunders 18 best moves a bunch of great moves bunch of bunch of excellent moves black did not make a single mistake black took a pawn and uh played every single defensive measure pro uh correctly slingshot of the queen around the board put Five Pawns on the six Rank and uh and won the game terrific excellent stuff so clearly cheater too is better than cheater number one all right and that guy got my got revenge for me because I got pancake by cheater one and cheater one is a slow cheater clearly really trying to be sophisticated all right as you can see here uh the guy playing with the black pieces literally every move two seconds two two three five oh one two five three three two three two three three two one like no move ever got more than five seconds spent on it not a single one just a super balanced like bot-like approach seriously I think the longest this person ever spent on a move was five seconds and that happened three times yeah hilarious so cheater number two versus cheater number three can cheater number three be the one to finish the rodeo well this time we have uh this opening and remember how last game it's actually kind of hilarious last game uh cheater number two played against cheater number three and this was the position you remember this it's actually kind of hilarious because this happens in this game and black goes here Knight D6 all right still a move don't have to cheat every single move and sometimes you know maybe you play your own opening moves so Bishop D5 so the person playing with white clearly not as sophisticated of a cheater right couple hundred points uh lower and uh we have Luxembourg versus Colombia and uh White plays Bishop D5 right so slight inaccuracy according to the uh to the feedback over here um we have Bishop B7 played in one second white span plays rookie one rookie one is the best move uh D3 best move Bishop F6 best move what even is Bishop F6 just defending the center I guess now white plays Bishop D2 now Bishop D2 is considered a a an inaccuracy on a low depth the computer shows this move on a higher depth the computer wants white to take the Knight all right so White's computer that they're using whether it's on their toaster or smartphone is not as good as Black's computer uh black after Bishop D2 plays Knight D4 which is actually granted according to this stockfish and an accuracy label but it's actually a pretty good move like if you let the engine run it actually thinks Knight D4 is not bad so clearly whatever engine black is using to play in one second is still pretty good uh White NOW plays the top engine move which is Knight E5 so what was Black's idea what was the bot's idea to lose this Pawn well the idea was to play C6 all right Bishop goes to B3 and now black secures the bishop and now is going to play Knight F5 so it's an equal game so who's gonna win bot one or bot 2 they are both making moves at identical speeds so what happens when you've got two Bots playing at the same speed it's who's ever got the better but right white plays Knight G4 one of the top moves black plays Bishop E7 in one second one of the top moves all right Knight E2 undeveloping top move D5 top move night what Knight E5 all right that's not one of the top moves Bishop D6 is the top move though and now Knight G3 takes takes all right so black is a touch better point two F6 best move Knight back to F3 black pins as you can see Black's Advantage is building Rook A4 whoa Queen D7 defending the bishop and now white makes a slight in accuracy which is Knight E5 all right White Spot decided I'm gonna play Knight E5 and I'm gonna force a big exchange both queens were hanging so you couldn't take Bishop takes D1 which obviously Black's bot saw and now we have the following position and clearly uh White Spot thought this move was gonna trap the bishop that's what White Spot thought it thought I'm gonna trap the bishop uh it was wrong because even though this happens Black's bot saw a little bit further and now Bishop C1 will escape and Bishop H6 and now blacks uh bot is up seven pawns to six and it will show us how to convert by the way they are dead even on time I think black just play it black just paid for the premium version of the box like I think White Spot is 2300 2400 and I think black spot is like 2800 or something F4 mistake why because of that move I don't know why Bishop has a king F2 Bishop D2 now black look at this if you have a dark squared Bishop black puts all the pawns on the light squares to complement the bishop now rotates around and black completely clamps down Rook d8 Rook D7 King F7 every important piece in the black position is on a light square and as you can see white spot is trying to trade into an end game black spot has already seen the entire future Pawn takes Pawn takes every move that black is playing his top Engine line the king now walks to the other side of the board the bishop has been removed and now A5 and that's it we're coming in we're coming in notice how this blob completely shut down White's play but we are still dead even on time actually in fact black spot has played a little bit look at this you think any human on the planet here doesn't take this Pawn you know what the top engine move here is after G4 taking on G4 is -23 but King C2 is -25. and now the second line of the engine is to just give up the bishop and that's it black spot hunts down the white pawns White's not you think any human here doesn't take on D4 he's just not even taking on D4 Bishop here King D4 FG and now the pawn walks down GG the person playing with the black pieces was 38 and 5 in Blitz 38 and five some of those Blitz Games could be disconnects or losing on purpose but all these individuals were banned and this this Loop started from me losing this funny game and I went to this person's profile just to watch them get their soul taken the game prior uh and then yeah this person was clearly the villain of the day I love watching when people who are cheating run into other cheaters these games that they come up with I mean nothing compares to this position after something like 10 moves like look at this it's so bogus like it's just so funny these people don't realize how absurd they look when they cheat uh and this all started yesterday with my game so I hope you enjoyed the video and uh cheater content is abound there's cheaters every day in every place so uh you know the drill folks get out of here
