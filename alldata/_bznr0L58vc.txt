ladies and gentlemen arguably the single greatest existential threat to many Industries around the world is AI but in chess that is absolutely not the case in fact in chess the single greatest existential threat is a child we've see now more than ever young kids from all over the world are becoming unfathomably good at the game of chess and so much so that a world record was just broken a world record so astounding that I've got to share it with all of you now what I'm talking about is this this young man from Turkey whose name is yagis Khan erdogmus just became the strongest ever 12-year-old surpassing a 35-year-old world record held by the greatest women of all time udit Polgar he is going to be rated 2570 and he's 12 and one more thing of note Magnus Carlson is not on this list he clearly was a late bloomer only really understanding how to play Chess at that level at the age of 13 so this young man from Turkey is absolutely unbelievable and I'm going to show you three recent games where he absolutely brutalized his opponents on route to getting this world record before I do that I'd like to thank the sponsor of today's video displayed folks have you ever looked at

space beautiful let's get back to the video now I do just want to say I always try to put people's names into Google Translate for how they're supposed to be pronounced and if I were to speak Turkish I think this young man's name would be pronounced y erus kind of like that I listen to about 20 times and I was trying to do my best it's a tough name to pronounce especially cuz a lot of the letters are silent so um I'm going call him yasan or I'm going to call him ER dogmas cuz he's got that dog in Him Anyway this is a game that he played in uh December of 2023 and then I'm going to show you two games he won in the caroan this dude loves the caroan and he is crushing people in the caroan which is amazing because I play the caroan and I I I'm literally going to learn something from this 12-year-old and so are you all right you got to learn three things from today's video so he played this game in December uh of 2023 against his countryman vahap sonal Olympic level player for uh the country of Turkey this one was a Spanish which is fitting because they played this game in Spain A6 Bishop A4 all of this has been seen before and now in this position white does not play the classical move C3 uh well Rook e one rather for C3 just loses a Pawn on e4 but Rook e one followed by C3 instead he plays D3 defending the pawn right away you may be wondering by the way why is he an international master that is because chess is really weird um yasan is already a Grandmaster like he fulfilled all the requirements but to get it approved they approve them once a quarter for some reason like I don't know why you can't just go on a website and show that you did it and then they I don't know it's actually really stupid it's actually really stupid I don't know why they anyway B5 Bishop B3 D6 C3 so he has to wait a few months to become an official grandmas Bishop D7 very normal game but again remember kids 12 so let's see how he plays a slow maneuvering positional game he plays Bishop to C2 okay getting the bishop out of the way of the Knight maybe advancing with B4 supporting the center and looking to play D4 as well black plays Rook E8 very flexible move white has many options you could play H3 Rook e one develop a piece he plays Rook e one to support the center black plays H6 now he develops the Knight and a very common idea in these types of E4 E5 positions this move Knight to F1 okay trying to put a knight out over there in the future black plays G6 he's trying to finish the Journey of the bishop which he does and now you know clearly after Knight E3 actually really what I should say is the computer really doesn't like G6 it doesn't like this approach by black uh it prefers to kind of keep the bishop on f8 for the future once you put the bishop on G7 you kind of are stuck like it's it's a little bit difficult for the bishop to participate and white has some pretty nice control of the squares in the center and now white plays this move B4 just trying to take a little bit of space black plays Bishop E6 and yasan says you know what I think a light squared Bishop trade is good another common idea for black in many of these positions is to succeed with the move D5 now D5 right now leads to some crazy stuff instead of that black goes here so he just defends the center and white develops as well very slow game and now finally yasan decides to write Knight to D5 we're going to put an end to this kind of staring contest let's try to trade some pieces uh instead of trading V hop plays Knight to E7 and actually immediately Yan just kind of advances forward with this Pawn so he controls the a file right controls the a file and uh we're going to see what happens with the pawn play in this position it's it it's it's maybe an idea for black to take but you really don't want to give white all of this you really don't want to Rook A7 B5 like there's a lot of unpleasant things here so black goes here here and tries to fight back and now you kind of have this moment actually as it turns out that was the best way to play Bishop D5 and and and now C6 all white has here is the light squ Bishop he's got the two Bishops his Pawn is hanging on B4 he plays Bishop to B4 D5 and now it's a very very tense moment vop has everything going for him he's going to open up the center of the board but white just Waits and now this move Rook C8 Queen B2 D4 arrives and this is not what you wanted so this now leaves white with a permanent monster of a bishop the bishop on B3 is extremely good instead of that in a in this position after let's say queen C2 black should have just waited by doing something trying to make something happen you know Bishop f8 King G7 suddenly white just has an easy game black plays Rook C7 look at that he's just coming in now black tries to explode the game we have this dynamite strike Bishop takes F7 he grabs the KN back and everything is fine we have the exact same position but black doesn't have an F Pawn Black's F Pawn is a B Pawn and so once he wins that pawn which he does literally in a moment he's just completely winning he just plays King E2 Knight D2 and he's just up a pawn and the worst part is the pawn that he's up makes Black's position completely split and black will very quickly lose a second pawn queen B2 Rook B7 he doesn't even need to lose the second pawn queen C7 he's completely out of moves Queen H3 Queen H6 and here black resigned because he's going to move his King back and lose both of these pawns th this Pawn this pawn and probably that pawn as well this was an absolute positional domination this was a master class of a game he was just patient I mean I could learn from this game I I'm being honest I looked at this game I was like this is incredible he just beat a 2600 like it was nothing you know black played this kind of approach with the King that was a little bit slow and then you know black equalized probably right here was this moment of like black kind of got everything he wanted and now the engine literally says you know Queen E7 King H7 and just wait but black trying to play for more and immediately got nothing like immediately got absolutely swarmed into a worse position all white had to do is defend himself and the kid is winning incredible and he forces his countryman to resign 2600 level grandmas like that excellent positional game and like I said he plays the Carlon these are two games that he played in the charia Masters uh which was a really really strong tournament held in the UAE and uh he he got 50% he scored four and a half out of nine he had two wins he had two losses and he had five draws which in that field was ridiculous considering all his opponents were like better than he was by rating and he gave an interview and he said I'm not happy with my result so like kids got a Michael Jordan mentality and he's 12 it's ridiculous so how does he beat people in the car well his opponent aditia malal is ridiculously well prepared very strong player very ve very good theoretician obviously to get to 2607 very impressive by the way some of you the Indians who are watching this probably absolutely know who Aditi and matal is but I got to tell you for most chess fans like there are so many strong talents in India well say hello to another one Adia is like 17 18 years old he's like 26 something plus couple of years is going to be 2700 probably C5 all right this is what I recommend for you to play in the Carl generally I play Bishop F5 but I was very shocked to see eras playing this which is supposed to be like not very good because of this line Knight F3 and queen D4 it's completely ridiculous but this has been played and white is able to get some form of an advantage like this so Knight to C6 all right the queen goes to F4 and now this has all been played before generally black TR tries to develop in the center and now our Doos plays F6 which in some ways F6 makes makes a lot of sense because that pawn is really annoying and if white takes it white is an idiot and is just in a much worse position cuz the queen is like what's the queen doing right but the point after F6 is that if white develops aggressively with moves like Knight C3 with moves like Bishop B uh not there Bishop my my mouse is like broken I'm going to replace it uh Bishop to B5 uh Etc like white is getting some Advantage there's a game in the database between Andrew Hong if you don't know who Andrew Hong is he's a Grandmaster I've actually covered a game that I played against two games actually I played against him on my YouTube channel but uh he's also the friend of uh Brandon Jacobson named in this entire crazy voo drama this deep lore for the chess fans if you watch this you have no idea what I'm talking about don't worry about it uh but Andrew Hong played a game against the international Master Josiah steerman that was at the United States Junior Chess Championship 2023 if you uh if you're wondering like how do I know that do I know that by memory no I saw it in the database this is a very rare idea and in the game matal as you can watch his time 6 minutes he doesn't know what he's doing doesn't know what he's doing he plays Queen G3 because he thinks you know what I'm going to safeguard my Pawn a little bit and now Eros plays G5 bro what and you know the craziest thing about G5 he's been 23 minutes that's the best move what the how is that even possible what even is G5 well G5 is that the queen is offside I mean the queen is like it's about to be trapped and if you put a knight on F5 it's really bad news so this kind of weird opening stuff like eras is so good it last game we saw a positional game this game we're seeing whatever the heck this is so these young players they have patience they have Poise they have great opening preparation but they have a universal style which is a nightmare which is why I said in the introduction of this video ladies and gentlemen the biggest existential threat to chess is the children all right that's what it is Knight to D4 from matal Queen B6 and from the opening I mean it is eramus who's just got a massive lead in development Bishop C6 bc6 oh excuse me Queen C6 Queen C6 bc6 is playable Queen C6 is fancy that is a queen sacrifice to get one back and the and the funny thing is white doesn't have to take the queen if you take the queen and I take you and you take me and I take you what happens is I emerge up uh up the bishop pair with a very powerful light squir Bishop on the way I I'm tell this mouse is just bro is broke Mouse broke slammed it after doing too many puzzles what can I say uh Knight F5 is played Instead This and my man he doesn't stop look at look at this move H5 look at this move look at this move H5 what what is this he could have castled queenside he said no thank you I don't want to Castle Queen side because if I Castle Queen side that gives white time to play Knight D2 Knight F3 Knight D4 maybe start his own attack so how about I attack first I'm going to play H5 now white opens up the position and Strikes Back on the king side but that is a very brave move from Matel to play H4 um the best move for white is to just allow the attack to to arrive and try to defend because if you start fighting back H4 isn't is basically saying look dude you can take right and I'm happy taking back and you can't attack me anymore no but you can I mean and this is what happens when you get people out of a comfort zone this is what happens when you get people to a situation they've never been in they're a little bit uncomfortable ADI is a very good player you cannot possibly tell me he's going to survive this attack he's not equipped not that I'm not saying he's not good enough he doesn't have the pieces he doesn't have a light squ bishop and the threat right now is D4 and white resigns because Queen G2 is made so white needs to stop that right yeah and now I'm going to bring a bishop and I'm I mean I'm I'm literally just going to do this this and that how do you defend against that Knight D2 Rook G6 well he tries to play F4 which makes sense he's blocking out the bishop Rook G8 out dogos has not done anything complicated nothing literally I mean the opening was weird but if I asked you from this position play a few moves for black guess what all right some of you would go you know here or something but the rest of you would like you know think oh I Castle along cuz I Advance my pawns here and then I attack yeah yeah the position is actually so easy to play even a caveman can do it shout out to Geico sponsor the Channel please Rook G6 F4 Rook he hasn't done anything too impressive right everything makes sense now how is he going to take the next step in this game and win got to bring the queen Queen's the heavy hitter by this point aditia is like moments away from holding play A6 Bishop G5 there's almost no attack anymore because you blocked the file so what does our dogas do runs to G4 Queen H5 now at this point see how Adia took both pawns takes F6 takes takes H5 what Adia is doing right now is like a poker play all right what he's doing right now is he's bluffing he's taking as many pawns as possible and just sort of saying I don't see how I lose right now and since I don't see how I lose right now if I don't lose I'm going to have more Pawns in the end game right for example Queen H7 like look at the end game evaluation white is better so he's playing for the end game Rook G4 Queen H5 Bishop F4 but ermos is a is a moment away a moment away from getting in Rook G5 where's the queen going to go Queen E2 now we've arrived and uh you cannot stop me taking on H2 uh G2 G2 not H2 Knight F1 there it is our dogos did not do anything flashy in this game anything particularly insane he played a very straightforward attack on white there was absolutely nothing white could do and he ends this game you think oh that bang bang here here Queen G4 black goes on to win you're right you're right yeah Queen E2 probably eat some pawns you know it's Queen for rook and Knight and black will be up some pawns and there's maid on the way if the knight ever moves yeah yeah but part of being a really good player is finding moves like Queen H3 doesn't Rush he attacks the rook and says hey aditia can you take my Rook please he doesn't have a choice and now we have all of the makings of the attack and we have a force Checkmate Queen to H4 and that is the end of the game why is it a force mate if King F3 Rook G3 Knight G3 Queen G3 is Checkmate so Knight G3 Bishop G3 Bish F4 look at that look at that absolutely butchered on the diagonals and aditia never even moved his Rook 32 moves by white not a single one of them was with the Rook that is because he was caught he was just sort of caught out like in a position where you know the biggest mistake he made by far was a was was H4 if if ad Dida hadn't played H4 if he had given a check and then maybe played like Queen E3 or whatever like he would have probably went on to lose but honestly maybe not like this is a better position for black but you're not opening any of the position ad Didia just went H4 and was like well he can't he's not going to but he I mean he literally got mated because he opened the G file so obviously a misevaluation there from matal and an absolutely surgically precise game from erogos and he did it again he played the caroan later I you know like I'm going to tell you guys there are critics of the caroon I love the Caron I've played the carocon for 13 years uh but there are critics right there's like you get to a level in chess you get to like 2,200 you you have this moment of Awakening and I don't mean rapid I mean 2,000 over theboard and there's this class of players in the top one 2% every video game has this amount of players like they have the players who think they're good but they're garbage they don't actually realize they don't know anything and people are like well I'm not going to play the Carl con because the grand Masters don't play the caran and yeah you know it's true The Meta at the top 20 level of Chess is like hold with black don't take any risk that's not the meta for a 12-year-old who is now the best 12-year-old of all time he's the highest rated 12-year-old to ever exist in chess right he just plays openings he likes and enjoys and he's winning games he's still finding ways to surprise people and take them out of a comfort zone take some risk in this game sethuraman also very strong Indian grandmas a little bit older not like one of these guys who's going to you know be 2750 but very very very good he plays exchange caran The Exchange caran is what you play with white because it's easy to play you don't have to be a rocket scientist and you excuse me get a very pleasant position Queen C7 just move H3 and generally you play like this because you want to play E5 he plays C6 I've never seen this approach and guess what I'm going to do after I analyze this game for you guys I'm going to go I'm going to go add this to my database Queen C7 E6 you know and the approach this is a modern approach to The Exchange where black puts the Knight on E7 okay okay cool Bishop D6 knight7 instead of the traditional Knight to F6 I don't know there's some different reasons for this and I'm going to show you the reason in a moment the reason is that after this by the way some of you may be wondering is there a Greek gift sacrifice uh it looks like it works by the way it looks like there is a Greek gift but King G6 and if you can bring the king forward and survive you will survive because you will play F5 Queen G4 doesn't work there is F5 and after this uh there is no Checkmate so you can play like uh I mean got to tell you it is a little bit scary but you can even play Bishop D7 and there is just no mate like there is a check but there's no check mate and then if something like Queen H4 Rook h8 uh not Rook G8 that's some mouse slip as I've been doing the entire video so this is all to say white doesn't do that black plays Knight G6 and black plays Bishop D7 and black is going to play F6 C5 for a second caran in a row in the previous game he played F6 on move six in this game you know this is the idea like black wants to get a little bit more of an active kind of caran so we have take take Rook C8 Knight F1 he puts his Knight on F4 and there it is he's right like this is the way he plays he plays this caroan he plays very provocatively but it's based in good foundational positional chess and he's going to try to play for E5 white plays Knight E3 black plays Bishop to E8 the idea of Bishop E8 is that if you had rushed with this move E5 this is a little bit too dangerous you're flying a little bit close to the Sun so he plays Bishop E8 the idea of Bishop E8 is let's say I don't know Rook C1 I think he just wants to go here and put pressure on white like this which kind of takes away from Central pressure which is why he gets his opponent to play H4 and then G4 this is bananas this is bananas like he provokes such an overreaction from his opponent this move Bishop E8 must have really made sauran uncomfortable because didn't know how to deal with the incoming pin he just didn't he already thought it was a bad position which is why he spent 14 minutes on a pawn push the best thing for white to do was either to get both pieces out of the way or to even play G3 and after Knight H3 the Knight has to go back Knight takes F takes and the computer thinks this is enough counterplay for white the opening of the position has occurred Black's main idea is now gone and if you play G6 white gets plenty of counterplay and this position is quite nice Sean didn't go for that he played H4 he played G4 and now erdogmus has this position to work with let's see how he converts it the problem when you push pawns like this in front of your king they can't go backwards so now Knight H3 check the King has to go to F1 and there yeah this he is the one who knocks yeah I I told you yasan eras and this man has the word dog in his name all right he is a dog that's what he is all right Knight G1 take take we seal the center shut look at the difference in where the e- pawn is I'm touching my screen you you can't see but like look at the difference yeah look at the difference like this is a problem and there's a bunch more space and you know what's going to happen by the way in a few moves yeah what's going to happen in a few moves is I'm going to play f52 and then I'm going to put my knight here and good luck all these pawns are standing around ready to be taken I mean I used to have carocon games like this back in the day but they were not against 2600 level players all right and he is making it look easy and for the second game in a row he is mercilessly ending the game by by attacking his opponents Rook E3 Knight Queen G4 and watch as this game ends I mean this is this is awesome look at this F4 right Rook e eight white has to give away the two the the queen for the two Rooks but the reason this is winning is because of this pawn it goes to F3 now Queen and Knight like white can black can absolutely go here he could do that and win queen of Knight but he's he plays Queen G he plays Queen G3 he waits he plays Knight F2 check that Rook now has to sacrifice and the pawn is still there and he ends this game by going check F2 and promoting to a knight bro he did this on purpose like he did the craziest part is if he made a queen he loses Knight G5 Rook h8 y'all it's never too late to lose a game you would know and me when I play GMS all right you when you play 400s but you know we're not we're not the same F1 Knight look at that that is ridiculous and that that's the end of the game because now the queen is able to come help or The Rook has to sacrifice now he wins the Knight he's going to win all the pawns and that's uh that's that's the end every single Pawn gets taken siamon plays like one or two more moves and he resigns 2570 I will remind you I'm going to go full screen again just so you understand this young man is 2570 he's going to be 2600 before he's 13 years old I mean he's making it look effortless he's beating people who are 2600 ft and he's making it completely effort he's making it look so easy absurd just what can I even say and and I'm going to keep bringing you the these stories do let me know in the comments if you if you enjoy these kind of like updates about the Chess World about the young young stars and uh yeah we'll see what his career uh what his career has to offer very exciting and uh that's all I have for you today friendly reminder if you're watching
