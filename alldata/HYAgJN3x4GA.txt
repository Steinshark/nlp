in this video we'll be deriving an efficient way of determining whether or not at some point P lies within the triangle ABC pay attention to this diagram as I move point P around as you can see the blue line represents a facts are pointing from A to B while the red line is a vector pointing from A to C together they describe the position of point P relative to point a perhaps this is a little clearer if I show the red vector starting from the end of the blue vector vector is controlled by a weight variable called w1 and the length of the red vector is controlled by w2 when both of these values are zero that means that point P is at a if I move point P over to B then you'll see that w1 is equal to 1 and W 2 is equal to 0 if I move P over to Point C this would of course be the other way around okay so this is an interesting way of describing the position of point P but how does it help us with our task well notice that if I move the point out past the edge AC then w1 becomes negative if I move the point out the other side then w2 becomes negative and if I move the point out past edge BC then w1 plus w2 will add up to be greater than 1 so if we can figure out the values for w1 and w2 we have a very easy way of determining whether or not P is inside the triangle let's write an equation for the coordinates of point P so we can say P is equal to a plus w1 multiplied by B minus a but W 2 multiplied by C minus a so this is just a mathematical representation of what we saw in the diagram I'm now going to write this equation after again twice once for the x axis and once the y axis I'll then rearrange the second equation to get w2 isolated on the Left we can then easily take this expression for W 2 and substitute it into the first equation to get a new equation with only one unknown W 1 our task now is to isolate W 1 on the left side of this equation this would be fairly straightforward algebra although of course having this many variables it is quite easy to make a mistake so let's work through this methodically I'll first get rid of this fraction by multiplying everything by C Y minus a why I've also multiplied these terms inside the brackets by CX minus ax as you can see over here a Len transfer B terms involving w1 over onto the left hand side and take this P X term and put that on the right hand side we can then reduce these two w 1 variables to just a single w one variable by enclosing all of this here in brackets to complete our task of isolating W 1 we can now just divide through by this bit highlighted in red we can now of course substitute this expression for W 1 into our equation for W 2 to be able to find the value of W 2 as well with these two equations we can now see that point P is inside the triangle if W 1 is greater than or equal to 0 and W 2 is also greater than or equal to 0 and W 1 plus W 2 is less than or equal to 1 alright that is everything for this video Cheers
