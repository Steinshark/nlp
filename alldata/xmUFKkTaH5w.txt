ladies and gentlemen sometimes what ends up being a scam may have started with good intentions and it's hard to pull a part of the threads of where malice meets incompetence but today that's what we're gonna try to do and i want to know your opinion what do you think was space odyssey the video game which we're talking about today to talk about the five signs five stages of uh crowdfunding scams do you think this was intended as a scam did it become a scam somewhere down the road it's hard to know but the interesting thing now that we're doing gofundme garbage this series by the way welcome back um the interesting thing is that you are i do find that sometimes i see a project and i think oh this might not seem like a scam to the founder but they're just so incompetent that it is a scam for the people who back it like they will never get the thing it will have to become something else they're backing a project that cannot exist but the hubris of the founder or maybe the incompetence causes that then there's a whole other category which is like no this person intended from the start for this to be a scam so i'm telling you guys from the outset i don't know which of these space odyssey started as it seems to start have started as may like some people thought it was legit because they got neil degrasse tyson on board uh but this brings us to the first step because now we're going back in time noodle grass tyson is heavily associated with this project it raised three hundred thousand dollars to date has delivered absolutely zero but the first step of any great you know gofundme garbage is the first stage which is optimism ladies and gentlemen what could be better than a gofundme but with nothing but promises but but it inevitably crashes but let's get into the hope of this project here's neil backing space odyssey the video game a physics-based bass sim we're thinking of releasing a game a video game provisional name for it is space odyssey is that clever space odyssey barrier i was trying to explore i'm teaming up with the video game producers can we think about a journey you might take where you control the formation of solar systems or planets of comets you you control the formation of life i mean honestly sounds great right like that does sound wonderful apparently three hundred thousand dollars which was the goal 314 000 is enough to bring together a fully real physics engine that can create galaxies and give you a beta tester and full game download guys complete with a hype trailer the goal was easily met how did we get here how did it all start where's han zimmer these are questions that restless thinkers have tackled over the millennia kepler and galileo copernicus isaac newton allow me to introduce to you all the next generation of exploration that we call the space odyssey wow i'm hyped what if the games you play could teach you the science of the universe i can't make any sense wait stop absolutely not okay i'm sorry this was an unintended rip on this stop trying to make video games education and stop trying to make education video games spatial geometry will never be space invaders i'm sorry i'm so sick of this thing where it's like hey guys this is done by all the pop science guys they go hey we can make science just as fun as video games no out of that what if education could be as exciting as online gaming this is like i hate by the way not because i don't admire the ambition but because i what i the problem i think is that it teaches kids that like you should expect education to be entertaining and my point is that it's not so why do we keep loading kids with that expectation stop pushing this like thing of like it's gonna be just as great as your you know call of duty as fortnite fortnite building or advanced calculus it's gonna be the same explore and to create their own worlds and turn it into a game suppose i gave you the power to make solar systems and to make planets this is a key thing with stage one it's about a lot of supposes suppose this suppose that but unfortunately they're taking real people's money for the supposes right part of the fund of space odyssey are the missions these don't exist these are challenges they'll allow you to learn but also to really explore this is one of the things i also hate about these gofundme pitches you can sell something that doesn't exist thinking you're like oh what are the things about our missions it's like wait do you have a mission system no okay then what are you doing space odyssey in a single sentence the universe simulated for three hundred thousand dollars oh and then tack on neil degrasse tyson's name on it so you ensure that people believe it's like an actual thing this is what you call you know using famous people's names to launder your scam to people it's a really common thing and unfortunately the person it hurts the most is the popular person who gets used this way so stage two what is that we have optimism stage two is delays and frustration now after the initial hype it's funded the money is gone it vanishes into the black box of the founders wallets now is the time where they actually have to execute and here's where the rubber meets the road and usually things spin wildly out of control initially there's always a lot of updates though as you can see we're still in 2017 we've seen a lot of updates here fully funded fully funded yes exciting but over time well you start getting posts like this we realize we haven't been giving regular updates on the game oh really and then the updates which first maybe seem like oh it's just the founders hard at work get well they just get uh well these breaks just get longer and longer between each update a hallmark of each of these new posts is apologies for not updating and then doubling down and saying we're gonna constantly update you from now on but it never happens and this is where we move quickly into stage three hatred this is when backers first show signs of turning on the project comments about refunds start cropping up comments about two full months no updates this is beyond ridiculous at this point three months since last update now beyond ridiculous hope at least i will get refund good luck it's been what now four months after this car kickstarter i'm gonna have to make a rule for myself not to back video games on kickstarter people start complaining blaming themselves blaming the project and it starts to get really desperate people start also driving home the original estimated delivery date of august 2018 and meanwhile nothing's been done a year later now here the project has two options they do one of two things they either go to stage four or they skip directly to stage five but stage four for most projects they go to stage four which is goal post shifting we saw this with the unibrush where they went from like a super advanced swedish danish design toothbrush to like the thing from hell uh yeah that's what they did here as well goal post shifting is where you basically say yeah the things we promised we didn't actually promise those from the get-go and actually we're going to try to deliver something but not what we said we were going to deliver in this case they start complaining that uh the initial funds they raised well those were only initial fees see it was just a starting point it was all a goof guys really when they said they were going to get you a beta test for your money they didn't mean that because actually once all expenses agency expenses marketing art creation and production and fulfillment of the books posters etc were sent out as uh and re rewards were deducted there was not a lot remaining on the development guys they didn't have money for development because they spent too much money on other dumb stuff apparently and this is the goal post shifting part the intention of the crowdfunding campaign was not to create a game no it was actually to introduce the vision of the game to the community and seed early development did you expect to get a game for this no clearly they didn't mean that we will need to continue to secure additional funding beyond the campaign a game of this magnitude needless to say requires significant capital to build so guys it was a goof when they said 314 000 will build this for you really it was to judge initial interest and it turns out you guys were pretty interested this is so beyond shameless now one hilarious thing here is that they say don't worry guys they apparently created a special for their supporters with the nasa store now remember everyone's excited about neil degrasse tyson mr spaceman so they partner with nasastore.com we can offer you 30 in credit on the site while they're going to give you free money well only if you order 75 or more aka like 30 off what complete garbage what is this that's not giving i hate when they say hey we give you 30 credit if you first spend 200 you go ahead and give me money you send me 100 i'll send you 20 bucks back that's the kind of credit i want to give you how stupid is that anyway you get very cool nasa and space stuff so you go so i went to this website you know wanting to look into this because i was like really it's called nasa space store and the domain is dead so you know me i gotta look into it well it turns out when you do some way back machines of this store it seems to be like some knockoff nasa merchandise and apparently they were like using um the logo or something possibly without permission because it changed from nasa store to now it's called mission control store see mission control store was formerly called nasastore.com so let's get this straight neil degrasse tyson partnered with a video game company which promised immersive realistic physics engines for three hundred thousand dollars they didn't do that so they said hey go spend a lot of money on a fake nasa store what who why how is this like hey i got you a great deal a bomber jacket for 97 at this point it looks like another cash grab from these people we don't know if they're a partner with them or what but of course this brings us into stage five of the crowdfunding life cycle of a scam stage five is abandoned minimize and move on this is where the crowdfunding project basically gives their last or what will probably be their last update so here we're seeing that their last post which was april 11 2020 so they've totally abandoned this project but they go like we understand the frustration we share it blah blah blah like a complex video game with real physics is costly and though we've not secured all of the funding to complete the game we are coordinating with a number of strong prospective financial and strategic partners that's probably a complete lie uh there's absolutely no evidence of that and it's probably just more minimization to keep people strung along while they basically run away with the money but that's basically it guys those are the five stages and if you want to run your own scam that's how you do it courtesy a la coffeezilla that's the way to go i hope you've enjoyed this episode this trip down memory lane to neil degrasse tyson's failed kickstarter but also an inside look at how these kickstarters fall apart so quickly thanks for watching hope you had a good one and i'll see you guys tomorrow up and smell the coffee
