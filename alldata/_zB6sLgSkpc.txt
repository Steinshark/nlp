ladies and gentlemen welcome back to the Chess World Cup 2023 a knockout tournament with some of the best players in the world including Magnus Hikaru Fabiano caruana yanyupomnishi you name it they are all playing there this is the only tournament that Magnus Carlson has never won and in today's video we are covering the end of the round of 64. a spectacular sacrifice of The Rook by Magnus we had a record broken which we will also cover in today's video massive massive upsets and Hikaru struggling in the early rounds of the event by the way I got in my front door 10 minutes ago it's 10 o'clock at night in New York I had a nine hour flight and I'm right here making the recap so you know how you should show your appreciation there are now a limited number of signed copies of my book signed copies there is a limited amount of them you can pre-order one they ship from Strand Bookstore here in New York City if you live abroad and the shipping is too much money that's okay you don't have to buy it don't feel any pressure but if you're American and the shipping doesn't cost a lot you can get a signed copy of the book and uh my friends we are why am I so pale oh my God is that really what I look like oh my God it's just awful okay uh my friends we are going to kick things off with the game of Magnus Carl so Magnus has a one to nothing lead friendly reminder the World Cup is two games that they play in classical chess against each other I haven't slept in 23 hours by the way I don't really sleep well on planes so if I say anything delusional in this video for legal reasons you are not allowed to do anything about it so anyway Magnus won the first game of two they play two classical chess games at the scores tied one to one then they play rapid playoff Magnus begins with Pawn to C4 this is known as the English opening we have a Norwegian playing a Georgian in Azerbaijan and it's in English C5 Levon pan solaya plays a symmetrical Knight of three G6 Magnus plays a very very quick D4 this is one of the ways to play of course in the symmetrical English you could play Knight F6 Knight C3 Knight C6 G3 G6 but one of the fastest ways to break the Symmetry is to just play the move d4 as fast as possible because black can't really play D5 now here Levon plays something really weird uh he plays Bishop G7 which is a which is a weird move because I mean you just don't do anything about this pawn and you allow your opponent to play the move D5 basically uh it is far more natural and common to go here at which point Magnus would have gone here and then Knight F6 Knight C3 Knight C6 E4 would have been played and probably something we would have went to a an accelerated dragon and Magnus would have went for some maroxy bind or something like that but the way this is played Magnus just goes D5 and then uh he just takes the entire center now Black's setup is relying on white to play Knight C3 at which point he can play what is called the beef eater or the pterodactyl defense with something like F5 I don't know if that's what Levon wanted and I don't have levon's Instagram or his phone number so I cannot ask him but Magnus didn't do that and he waited for his opponent to develop this Knight and you'll notice his opponent plays E6 and then Knight E7 and then Magnus plays Knight C3 and the difference is that if you do it this way you don't actually get F5 and this is just swiss cheese you don't want to trade off a dark squared Bishop when you put so many pawns on light squares in the other version you were okay doing it because you still got your knight to an active score you still fought for the center but this is just all bad so Levon now plays H6 Magnus takes on E6 and attacks the pawn in D6 and his opponent doesn't actually have a way of Defending it his opponent just gives it away and that's normal in fact you will notice that Magnus is down quite a bit on you know like he he doesn't know the best way forward here he he's debating to just developing and doing this but I'm sure Magnus didn't really want to get to a position where it was kind of like a king's Indian style attack Brewing uh so he took on E6 he went Bishop F4 and he won a pawn and then he just came back and his opponent seemed to be doing very well his opponent had a very very confident position trying to make a comeback you know everything you got to do to to try to beat Magnus throw him off his game and uh night before night before is a wild move um I I can think of more natural moves here like Rook to d8 the reason he did not play Rook d8 is because of Knight D5 which would have invited a queen trade and the pawn on B2 is not hanging because Rook B1 Rook B7 so why would have just traded queens and created a very powerful Square here and I think Levon got a little bit spooked which is why he spent 14 minutes to play this move uh there is a saying by uh by a strong Grand Master of Vladimir kramnik that basically said if you got to spend 15 minutes on a move it's probably not going to be good and the computer was not very happy with this move because just after the very simple A3 if black wastes any time going backwards this is still going to happen so he starts to fire with G5 right this is hanging but he counter-attacks the bishop Bishop H wow I feel drunk I am so tired like I want to fall asleep can I fall asleep in the middle of a recording uh anyway as you can see Levon is just Galloping into magnus's position with Knight to D3 check Magnus very quickly takes and actually instead of trying to hang on to his Pawn he just plays castles now c4 is hanging also C3 is kind of hanging it's not really hanging because if you try to win the pawn you get hit with this and you lose a full Rook but black would have this move so he would give up uh The Rook for the nut for the night but in the game black did this and and so after the opening stage actually Levon had a totally reasonable position he was doing very well Magnus played Knight D5 uh crisscross applesauce it's a it's a fiery position the bishop can take the Knight can take all of this can take the Bishop's got this over now Bishop takes Pawn takes and Rook takes D5 and for a brief moment Magnus is just straight up down a pawn the World Champ well not anymore but you know in our hearts uh how do you prevent black from castling here what do you do because if you do nothing Black's gonna Castle well you gotta you gotta Target the Knight right and then you have to Target a piece which is defended by the Knight and the queen so if black were the castle here uh black would still lose material now Lavon here really doesn't like this so he steps out of the attack with the King Magnus brings his Knight forward and then brings his Rook forward and Lavon now plays Knight D4 the position is actually still balanced Magnus goes King H1 so neither of these moves is ever a check Levon plays B5 hitting his Queen Magnus goes here now H5 once again is the best move from Levon uh and uh he's untangling he's just a moment away like he's going to move his Queen he might bring his Rook into the party he's got G4 to create an attack he's actually fighting Magnus Toe to Toe Queen B6 is once again the best move now Magnus plays Knight E7 attacking The Rook getting close to the king once again the best move is played 26 moves of perfect chess but that's not enough in this position the best move was Bishop F6 or pushing one of these pawns instead Levon goes here pinning the Knight to the queen Magnus plays Bishop C7 and The Rook is actually lost because if you try to keep the Rook on the back rank I play Bishop D6 check and Knight to E7 but here's the problem the only other way to protect Bishop D6 check is to go here and as you can see from what from from the m in the evaluation in this position Magnus Carlson sacrificed even on 23 hours of No Sleep Rook to EA check his opponent resigned he resigned because magnus's next move this is called an attraction sacrifice you attract the king like a magnet Queenie for check threatening the king if the king simply retreats to the square that it was on Queen A8 Rook d8 Queen d8 mate a ridiculous geometric Checkmate however rookiee check King Y8 Queen here what happens if somebody blocks namely what happens if the Knight blocks I have news for you it doesn't matter because it looks like the attack has been stopped but I sacrificed the queen and it's mate anyway Rook E8 check is a ridiculous move to attract the king zig zag and get to the king as well and Magnus Carlsen is into the round of 32 and if he is playing like this in this tournament these bozos better watch out cause they all gonna get it they all go and get it it's gonna be a fatality with the M Train good Train by the way runs between uh Middle Village Metropolitan Avenue and Forest Hill 71st Street yep bet you didn't know that New York meanwhile Hikaru has had a very different start to the event uh he's the second seed and he's currently the second highest rated player in the world it's very close with Fabiano uh first game that Hikaru played against Karthik venkataraman by the way can I give some props to chess.com I yelled at the staff in the first video recap and they they gave him they gave him a profile photo there we go uh he is the Indian Champion despite being something like the 15th or 20th highest rated player like he won the national championship of India and he's a rapidly Rising player um Hikaru plays a queen's Indian defense and they trade Bishops early Hikaru attacks the center but white gets a very pleasant position white brings the Rooks and has an absolutely solid setup Hikaru plays D5 couple of nights come off take take a couple of bishops come off a couple of Rooks come off it's Queen and night end game and uh magnus's recap lasted nine minutes the recap of hikaru's game is going to be much shorter in this game his opponent did not really make any indication of trying to create significant chances I think he was more than happy to make a second draw and Hikaru goes for a queen's Indian his opponent isn't able to create anything meaningful and Hikaru has drawn two games against the 2565 rated Indian Grandmaster now they have to play a rapid and Blitz playoff which they will do tomorrow and Hikaru is a massive favorite because he is probably the first or second best rabbit and Blitz player in the world but we'll see we'll see if karthik's ability to uh to to stimi uh to stifle uh Hikaru will will continue and if not well it was a good effort regardless but this was kind of a nothing Burger of a game it was sort of just me you know throwing you a little airplane snack if you will but this oh this is special this game is special this game is special this

chakraf azeri chess Legend and we have A6 now what's funny is that I have a course on this opening uh and it's called the Queen's game decline course it's on Chesley uh and obviously Ting Jingo has that course uh Bishop G5 is one of the ways to play and the idea of A6 by the way is to take and play B5 and normally what white will do is they will take and basically say this move is stupid the major river goes here trades Bishops and plays a little bit more solidly like this totally fine Knight C6 now he takes develops like this and in this position Knight E7 is played by tinging now he wants to play C6 B5 Bishop 5 wants to trade Bishops and in this position for basically no reason whatsoever shakriar plays G4 like again shock is the kind of player that does not like if you're going out on a Friday you don't even need to ask you don't even need to ask and if you do ask him it will take one invitation okay he's there okay he does not need a second invitation to party he's not one of these friends that plays hard to get or pretends to be an introvert and you know secretly just wants people to beg for them to come I'm introverted but yeah it might not seem like it because I talk a lot but um yeah I mean G4 he just doesn't even care uh Knight E5 F4 look at this position I mean right this is Ting Jing Yao is now dealing with the onslaught okay he's covering up right we got shocks standing up you know by throwing up coming over the top you know what I'm saying and and and and now he's got a this is what happens when I don't sleep for a day all right I just I just shadow box in the middle of a recap and and then you know we got we got teams again he's just backing up he's rolling with the punches he's looking for an opportunity to counter and here it is F6 there there's the opportunity to counter it has arrived uh and and now and now my man said you're not bullying me look at dirt that's big boy chess G5 if you take hello now the best part is taking is the best move best part is taking is actually the best move and then in this position white just has to play Rook F1 lose the pawn on H3 for some reason and play and you know what the idea of Queen to C3 is a lot of you are probably analyzing this move like oh I know the idea Queen City a very obvious queen of 5.7 duh and then like get in here like that's yeah obviously Queen C3 no that makes a lot of sense you know what the idea of Queen to C3 is the idea of Queen to C3 is to play King to sheet what King to C2 to try to attack on the H file that is the point you take you go here and then you do this to walk your king and attack on the H5 this is some stupid stuff and neither player sees that instead mamidyarv is like I'm gonna lose a pawn and I'm just going to attack like this and teaching I was like I'm up upon and Mommy jar is like I'm gonna attack like this and teaching I was like I'm of a pawn I'm sure I was like yeah but oh he he he's up a pawn oh wow yo but yeah but I got the pawn back yeah but now tinging out hits him with the Haymaker Pawn to D4 oh my goodness The Rook is hanging The Rook is infiltrating something is going to hit the king the Knight could get in whenever it wants H3 is going to hang then G4 is going to hang black is not getting mated Rook to C8 hits the bishop the bishop has to move the bishop blocks The Rook the Knight takes the pawn the pawn Falls that means the G4 is going to fall that means that Knight F2 is on the way that means that the king is still under attack the bishop takes A6 Bishop C6 check the Knight blocks the king Rook takes G4 the pawns have fallen oh my God changing out might be winning and he's also sacrificing this Rook because he's gonna take here King H2 Queen goes back to C8 and in all of the Tactical complications Knight F4 check King G1 Queen C1 Knight F4 check and chakra are mamidyarov resigns the game and Ting Jing Yao the Superstar player of Singapore has just knocked out a 27-42 rated player now let me tell you something about the career of Ting Jing Yao that I bet you didn't know a couple of weeks ago I played against Ting jinging out in Blitz on chess.com and he beat me two games out of three that is really impressive but this this is even more impressive than that oh officially now on the career accomplishments of tinging out is defeating shakri Army of in the world cup and then beating me two out of three and Blitz not a lot of people can do that he should be very very proud of himself shout out to Singapore shout out to Singapore chess on the map or as they say Singapore sort of that was my single attempt at a Singaporean accent Singapore Singapore you got a real one this dude is for Real we're going to be tracking how he goes another game this was a banger game semi-slav defense and history is made in the next game so if your attention span's like I've launched the chess video for 17 minutes oh my God no one's ever gonna love me that might be a separate issue um no no you trust me be it being a nerd is cool uh this game is great the next game is history Knight bd7 A3 Pawn trade in the center and noise gives up his dark Square Bishop to create a very powerful uh wall and also play Knight E5 just like my midiarif did in his game okay Knight back to D7 and now the players repeated moves and made a draw no that didn't actually happen castles take take Queen B6 and not your back has given up a pawn and Gotham is going to sip his spin drift because this was the only drink remaining in his house when he got home at 10 o'clock at night but after I upload this video I'm going to take a walk because New York City is one of the only cities in the world I think where you can walk at midnight and get like anything you want maybe like Tokyo I don't you can get like food drink laundry McDonald's that's food and drink I like Delirious Recaps F4 so not your back is a pawn down but he's looking to create an attack he's gonna have to play King H1 at some point you can't really attack with this many Pawns in front of your king and not licking each one because you're gonna get hit with checks right he takes on passong because he can and he wanted to demonstrate to his opponent that he can he also has opportunities to attack the king now Black's King is stuck in the center he cannot Castle F5 F5 is opening the door for the night Queen D3 and a couple moves later I told you King to H1 is played now black plays King C7 and wants to start firing back in the center don't plays Knight F4 with the intention of Galloping into the black position Queen A4 attacks the pawn in the center Rook D1 defends the pawn in the center and now the Knight goes to H5 the idea of Knight H5 and no longer 96 as this is no longer a check and furthermore if I take this or this and sacrifice my knight I will get my queen in over here so uh black now has to react very quickly take take rookie one H3 just making sure I think H3 is a little bit slow I think Niger but could have been a bit more forceful here but this is completely fine and his position is still looking very very nice but the problem as we have seen in this video is if you if you if you give a man if you give a man a fish he will eat if you teach a man how to fish he's gonna you know he's gonna eat it for the rest of his life I have no idea what that has to do with what I'm about to say but basically what we've seen in this recap is that if you give your opponents a pawn and then you don't take their soul they're still up a pawn and they're going to use it in fact the last game that we looked at literally changed the round when the move C5 happened yeah and look at the structure by the way it was almost identical so Queen E7 black defends himself and plays C4 and suddenly he's just got a pass Pawn and as long as he survives the apocalypse he is going to still have the pass pawn and that's what he does rookie six he takes not your back has gone all in and black just has a past pawn and in case I haven't made it clear black has a past pawn queen D6 Rook says she puts the Rook behind the pawn now Rook C3 and queen h8 that's very nice but that's it now black emerges up a queen in a rook for a queen and a bishop with various checkmating possibilities as well as all the winning end games Queen G5 Rook A3 and it was on move 44 that nojib resigned because if he plays something like H5 rookie 3 rookie one is game over as white has to lose the queen and norgerberg is knocked out of the Chess World Cup 2023. that is absolutely nuts wow that is crazy he is knocked out by vahap sanal of Turkey shout out to turkey turkey on the map of hopsinol is a beast in this game I save for last we also have a photo now of misreadian iskandarov my friends this is a massive moment in history something may happen that has not happened in nearly 40 years let's watch who cash with the black pieces plays the Knight C6 Sicilian and he plays the sashnikov Sicilian which is a very very complicated sharp line in this fashion called black has some weaknesses on these squares but tries to fight them with Dynamic play Knight to D5 this was the main weapon of Fabiano caruana versus Magnus Carlson in their world championship match they pioneered a ton of uh theoretical lines the Knight undevelops and black castles very quickly white often times will rotate here black is going to try to attack it's a very imbalanced and complicated position like at some point the move F5 is going to happen just wait for it I promise first black is going to develop some pieces there they are Bishop to B4 all right Knight C5 and there it is F5 all right Mr idean is also playing extremely quickly so clearly skandarov is very very well prepared uh plays Knight to B6 which is all been played before now Bishop takes Rook takes Pawn to B4 and basically white is just going to rely on this Pawn majority so white is mobilizing that structure he clearly has more space he's clearly dominant so the way black is going to try to fight back he's going to play E4 and white is going to try to lock the position now uh very tough for black to do anything if black doesn't take onpasson so if white just gets to play like Queen D2 and do whatever he wants black's Bishops are never going to participate in the game which is why after F4 he takes like this to maintain some opening in the position now his Bishop is a beast right the bishop on E5 standing in an absolutely fantastic manner rookie one Bishop F4 and uh already things have gone astray um Rook E3 was just not a good move instead white could have considered something like Bishop H5 or even bishop or even this move although even here apparently you can sacrifice and try to create some sort of attack with Queen H4 uh but this is a problem because now you cannot really move because of Queen H4 and there's like checkmates I mean it's a very unpleasant attack so his candara actually just gives up The Rook completely and puts his Queen on E6 but kukash just activates all his pieces and now there are two ways to win a winning position end game or Checkmate he trades Rooks he doesn't worry about this he trades Queens and he is just simply in a winning end game now this looks like it might not win be winning because you know if I don't know somehow black finds himself in a position like this with two pawns like white but that's not gonna happen because of this now Bishop tv4 if you take e2e1 because the Rook is cutting off the king Bishop to G4 Bishop D3 and we repeat one time now the king comes King F6 can't even take the pawn is King E5 and then he's he's just gonna be losing oops he's going to lose both Pawns he plays Knight C4 I should back to C6 and rather than even continuing this game white just resigned and the reason why this is so important uh is because with this win gukesh has now surpassed vishwanathan Anand as the highest rated Indian chess player on the planet uh and he is now locked in in the top 10 in the world now I'm gonna sign off this recap by just saying was the number was the first Grand Master of India since then they have had something like 70 of them if not more and that happened in around 1985 1986. this xianand has been the highest ranked and basically number one representative of Chess from India for nearly 40 years he has been the five-time world champion he has won countless tournaments he is a living legend of the game and even in his 50s he can clap all of these young bozos he was surpassed for like a day unofficially so at the beginning of every month there is an official rating list based on all the tournaments you played in the previous month somewhere in the middle of a month in 2016 pintala Hare Krishna in a massive effort overtook him but it was for a day and then he fell back to number two gukesh is here to stay gukesh is 16 17 years of age and he is the future of Indian chess so is pragnananda so is Arjun aragaisi so is raunak sadwani so is nihal sarin so is uh venkataraman who drew a Hikaru and and there are there's even more than that the future of Chess resides in India they are printing Grandmasters the way the United States was printing money a couple of years ago I mean it is really something congratulations to gukesh hopefully he has a great Olympiad the future looks bright Magnus Carlson is a buzz saw multiple upsets including the pride of Singapore Ting Jing Yao with a massive display will Hikaru bounce back from the two draws will he have a strong showing that's what we're about to find out World Cup 2023 coverage will resume and I am going to go get a juice and then go to sleep get the signed copy of the book seriously don't miss out there's a limited amount so if you wait someone's gonna get one trust me uh good night get out of here
