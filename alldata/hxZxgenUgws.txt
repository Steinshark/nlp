if you're anything like me the search for the perfect documentary zoom lens could feel like an impossible mission I mean don't get me wrong primes are fantastic but only when you have the time and freedom to use them well when you're working with this small team and you can't afford to miss a moment of important action or dialogue though then for me zooms are almost always the way to go the problem is that there are so many of them to choose from and a lot of them are really hard to manual focus or maybe they don't work well in low light or they just straight up don't look good for years now I thought I'd found the perfect solution in these Fuji non MK Cinema zooms but for the last month or so I've been testing out a new set of lenses that might change everything these laa Ranger lights made by Venus Optics so in this video we're going to dive into what makes these lenses such a joy to work with what their shortcomings are who I think should think about investing in lenses like these and whether or not they'll be replacing my Fuji non as my main documentary Workhorse lenses in [Music] 20124 so before we get going here I should say that I was really close to not making this video at all there's two lenses in this kit the 28 to 75 and this 75 to 180 and when laa sent me them almost 2 months ago the deal was that if I made a video about them I could keep one of them tell you which one I kept at the end but for now I just want to say that there's no sponsorship here there is no money involved and laa isn't reviewing this video before it goes up but if you've been watching this channel for a while you'll already know that I don't make Gear videos about things that aren't part of my full-time kit and while I'm sure some people out there won't believe me I already have all the gear I need to do my job at a professional level that means I'm not really interested in just collecting more stuff because I can and since I've been so happy with these Fuji for so long I was having a really hard time finding a project where I don't know I felt comfortable testing something new all that's to say that I was really close to just sending them back to laa without taking them out of the case but eventually I did find the right shoot for these as I'm sure you can guess from the fact that this video exists and let me just say I'm really glad I did even after 3 days of shooting I you can already tell that one of these lenses is going to see a lot of use in my full-time kit but what changed my mind and who do I think that these lenses are perfect for because I definitely don't think they're for everyone and does this mean that I'm going to sell off my Fuji well we're going to get these out into the field in just a second but first let me just break down quickly what these lenses are and how they're different from the MKS the Fuji non have been my go-to doc lenses since the day I bought them about 6 or seven years ago and they've never let me down the build quality and image are both amazing they're incredibly light and overall they're just such a joy to use the issue is that their super 35 or apsc coverage only meaning that if I try to use them on my fullframe cameras there's heavy vignetting on my fx9 I can just switch into Super 35 mode but on my fx3 or an fx6 or the equivalent from other brands you have to do a digital crop in and I just don't really like that now the laas on the other hand are full frame and there's no vignetting at all even when I shoot my fx9 at its full 6K resolution which is exactly what I did on this last shoot now you'll never hear me saying that shooting full frame is necessary for a great image and some of the best films ever made even today are shot at Super 35 this has nothing to do with super 35 being bad but with so many modern cameras coming out as fullframe only I'm running into the need for fullframe lenses more and more but I'm also not willing to give up the benefits of Cinema bodied zooms like I don't know having a smooth Focus pull and manual apperture control and without spending tens of thousands on a Cabrio or anenu Zoom there haven't been that many options out there so when I was finally able to get these guys out on set for a pilot I just dpd I was paying extra close attention to the build and mechanics of these things because after using the Fuji for so long I have pretty high standards for what makes a good doc Zoom the first test I ran them through was covering a fast-paced sports scene so let's get out there and see how they held [Music] up that's the key up this [Music] so we just finished the first official shoot with these lawa Ranger zooms and I got to say I'm incredibly impressed they look amazing the build quality is great they're a joy to use compared to Stills lenses but they are heavy and these are the light version so they're the lightest ones they make on this camera it's pretty much perfectly balanced and I was shooting off an easy rig all day so it wasn't a big deal but I would probably think twice about putting this on a mirrorless set up for all day verit shooting but for what we did today I really really like this thing and I'm definitely going to use it [Music] again so yeah I really like the construction of these things and they're definitely on par with the Fuji lenses and compared to Still's lenses like the 24 to 70gm I'm shooting on right now operating these things was so so nice don't get me wrong I've shot hundreds of hours on my 2470 and there's nothing all wrong with it but those lenses were designed with autofocus in mind and when you're shooting long scenes and you really need to flow with the action nothing can beat the focus pull of a cine lens and these laas got that part very right which I'll talk more about in a second but all this goodness comes at the cost of weight like I mentioned and that's really the biggest negative thing I found to say about these Rangers because even though this is the light version it is heavy clocking in at 2.8 lb or 1.3 kilos the non-light version is 3.1 lb and by comparison the Fuji are just 2.2 lb so there's a pretty serious difference between them even that half PB or 220 G between the light version and the MK zooms is really noticeable when you're shooting all day you just have to use more glass to make a lens cover a full-frame sensor and that adds weight but compared to highend cinema zooms like an anine new 15 to 40 which is 4 and 1 half or almost 5 lb and that's only super 35 as well this is actually really light or compare it to another classic doc Zoom the Cabrio 1990 which weighs a massive 6. 7 lb and suddenly this weight doesn't seem like such a big deal but those other lenses even if they're heavy they're incredibly nice to work with and the focus pulling is incredible and that's why people are willing to deal with the heaviness so how do these Rangers stack up against them in that department well later in the day of that shoot I was able to try it out while shooting some b-roll around the East End of Toronto between scenes so I've been shooting with these laa lenses for the best part of a day now we're on our first day of a 3-day shoot and we're out here on a bit of a b-roll mission and one thing I'm noticing like I'm really enjoying about these is just how nice the focus turn is when you get used to shooting on like 2470 or or Stills lenses for that matter it's really hard to precisely dial in your focus you know it's like tiny little turns of that ring and you can completely overshoot what you're trying to focus on but with this it's so smooth and so easy to control the speed and the focal point at the same time like I can pull as slow as I want and still be pretty confident that I'm going to be able to hit my final Mark and that's just really not possible with photob based lenses and I know it's theoretically possible with autofocus like I know you could go into the menu and change the sensitivity and the the the time and all those settings but honestly in a documentary or any fast-paced shooting environment just can't be fiddling with the menus like that it's so much easier just to have it all um manual and at your fingertips so it's just something I'm noticing they really did a good job with the gearing here and the focus ring in particular I know it's really trendy to put lenses in cinema bodies and they don't always work well for practical shooting but these ones are really great so yeah these lenses were a joy to shoot with and the focus throw was just perfect for a solo operator it was great shooting action and it was just as nice doing long Focus pulls on the b-roll shoot so top marks there but at this point you're probably wondering how they look and how they handle challenging lighting [Music] conditions well in the second part of that shoot I was able to test these in a bunch of situations from a fast-paced street scene and also in a really dingy hallway at night to see how they stacked up image- wise sometimes modern lenses can be a little too clinical looking and over sharp but I didn't really feel that with these I mean they're clearly not Russian vintage lenses or something like that but when I look at the depth of field in this hallway scene for example to me it's looking solid even at 28 mm the fact that we're using the full sensor here and shooting at t2.9 is a pretty noticeable difference from the last big shoot I did where we shot super 35 fs7 with F4 zoom lenses and I really like it the other thing that surprised me was how they handled light and flaring mostly in a good way like when we were shooting a scene in the basement basketball court and I was working with some pretty strong backlight there was a kind of soft hazing feel that I was really into the lens also flared nicely under the right conditions and even though there was a certain angle where the flar sort of turned into like a hard dot that I didn't love in general the way it handled itself was really pretty in my opinion again lenses like this probably aren't for you if you want to go for a highly stylized look like the Batman or something but that's not really what I want in a Workhorse doc Zoom I normally want a mostly clean image with a little bit of character because that's what most clients want on those projects where I'm totally in charge or when the client is down for a bit more of a stylized look that's all rent something different but I'm not going to use them every day so obviously I'm not a focus chart guy but in my opinion after shooting a bunch of different conditions with these I'm more than happy with how they look but as I say that for docs raw image quality is not usually the main marker of good cinematography in my opinion I mean yeah we want our stuff to look beautiful and if a lens helps with that then that's amazing obviously but what's really going to make your cinematography shine is learning how to cover scenes well with good shot variety while using imagery to emphasize the emotion of your story great DPS should be able to do that with pretty much any lens and that's why I spend so much time in scene coverage in my documentary cinematography course rather than lens tests the course just closed but you can check out the link in the description if you want to know a bit more and get your name on the weit list and I'll send you a discount before I open the doors again so who do I think these are for and who do I think should buy them well honestly I think they're perfect for documentary DPS like me shooting on medium to larger camera builds they're well built they have solid image quality they're great for manual focusing and the zoom zo range is very usable as the only lens you need to cover a seam if you add the 75 to 180 as the second lens in your bag for b-roll and maybe a second angle on your interviews you can pretty much cover everything you need between the two of these that is as long as you have a full-frame camera because on a super 35 sensor I just don't think that the 28 mil on the wide end of this is wide enough on my fx9 at fullframe 6K it was just about perfect but much tighter than that and I think I'd probably struggle to get wide enough in some indoor settings and in Doc lenses wide is Ty typically more useful than tight the extra weight is a bit of an issue but like we said compared to other popular doc zooms they're actually fairly light and if you have a rig with the right center of balance like a builtup fx9 or an fx6 with the vmount system on the back it's very manageable if I was shooting mirrorless only though and especially if I didn't have the rig built up these could feel pretty front heavy and get really tiring to hold all day so if that's the kind of setup you have I'd probably suggest renting them for a day to see how they feel because when I did try them out quickly on my fx3 which wasn't rigged up it wasn't all all that comfortable but what about the price because at $3,500 they're hardly cheap well actually when you compare them to some of the other popular zooms out there like the Cabrio I mentioned they're actually really cheap as crazy as that sounds like the Cabrio are $29,000 and the Anu Optima 19 to 94 is $56,000 so it's really all relative the better question is do I think that the price is fair for what you're getting and the short answer is yes yeah if you're shooting all the time and you can afford it then I do think they're worth it the Sony GM 24 $7 is $2,300 for reference and there's no comparison to how much better this Cinema housing and all these Focus rings are for documentary scene coverage so then who shouldn't buy these well if you're the kind of shooter who needs autofocus for everything like if you do a ton of gimbal work or something like that then clearly these won't work as well as their full manual only for me full manual is a good thing but I know everyone's needs are different here I also don't think I'd get these if you were only shooting handheld mirrorless setups because the weight distribution is just a little bit too front heavy and especially if you need it in e-mount which requires this extension tube thing which pushes the weight balance even further out on an EF or a PL Mount camera it might be a bit better but I can't think of any PL Mount mirrorless cameras anyways this doesn't really matter if you build out your mirrorless a bit and maybe counterbalance it with a large battery then it's a different story but unless you're working with a tripod or an easy rig or even a CLE to help with the weight it might get rough okay so obviously these aren't for everyone if you're just building out your kit and you don't have a ton of shooting experience then I probably wouldn't suggest these as your very first lens unless you have Deep Pockets but if you've been shooting for a while and use fullframe cameras and you're looking to step up from Stills lenses to something that allows for more precise overall control and just a more pleasing image then in my opinion these lenses are an investment that should set you up for many many years now the final question to answer here is whether or not the ranger lights will be replacing my fujian MKS as my main dock lenses and let me just be straight up here if I I already own the Fuji like I do and I wasn't able to get this for free I kind of doubt I would have bought them on a whim it's true that it started to get inconvenient at times when I have to shoot a job on a full-frame camera like an fx6 and I can't use these Fuji non but I've been more than happy with these lenses for about a half decade now and for a lot of jobs especially the remote ones where every ounce counts I think I'll stick with the MK zooms because they're really noticeably lighter on top of that for a lot of projects I really don't need to shoot fullframe 6K because the super 354 K crop still looks amazing on my fx9 but with that said sometimes projects come up where I'm either locked into certain full-frame camera systems for logistical reasons or when I'm not running around in the jungle or the Arctic and a slightly heavier setup isn't a big deal in these situations it's a bit more complicated and it's where the Rangers really open up the full power of my camera while still giving me the versatility of a zoom in a way that I just haven't been able to do before this is the first time I've used them properly like I said but I could easily imagine a future where I split my shoots between these and the Fuji depending on the job now if I didn't own the Fuji and I had a medium to large size full-frame camera and I wanted a great qualityto price ratio that would cover me in pretty much any documentary scenario and I think these would be right at the top of my buy list and I think you'd be extremely happy with them too I'd even go so far to say that if I didn't have the MKS when I got my fx9 I might have just bought the Rangers instead but who knows I love both of these lenses at the end of the day it's really just going to come down to what you're shooting with and what your needs are this set works really well together as the 28 to 75 is a great all-purpose ver lens and the 75 to 180 covers your b-roll needs but since I'm only allowed to keep one of these it's a no-brainer witch the 28 to 75 all day as a doc shooter telephoto lenses are more of a specialty tool and I'll sometimes go multiple shoots in a row without ever using them a great mid-range Zoom with Cinema gears and good build quality though is something I can use every single day so if you're curious about these but don't want to Shell out for both of them the choice is pretty easy in my opin ion 28 to 75 so that's it for this one check out the link in the description if you want to learn more about the ranger lights or my cinematography course and don't forget never ever buy gear on credit see you [Music]
