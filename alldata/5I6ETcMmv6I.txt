ladies and gentlemen karma is defined as the sum of a person's actions in this and previous states of existence viewed as deciding their fate in future existences many of you believe in karma many of you don't believe in karma but karma and chess exists in the way that I will be presenting to you today I will now stop speaking in riddles you see I have a playlist on my YouTube channel that many of you enjoy it's called how to lose at chess an ironic title where essentially I analyze games that you send in to me I show you the most common mistakes I laugh I cry I scream I nearly vomit but in today's video I did all of those things myself in a game that I played and today I am extremely embarrassed to show you the following game that I played a couple of days ago that's it that's the introduction now before we get into the game today I'd like you know I usually thank a sponsor here and then a thing plays today's video doesn't have a sponsor uh it's uh it's actually an announcement of an upcoming event which will happen in Charlotte North Carolina and it's uh it's the chess kid national festival so if you are kindergarten through 8th grade or you are a parent or you know somebody who's a parent and you live around Charlotte North Carolina consider coming to the ches kid national festival it's a 3-day event there's going to be tournaments games biggest in-person chess Festival uh in a I don't know in a meaningful period of time February 16th through 19th uh in 2024 I'm going to be there there's a VIP package with a limited number of offerings uh and I'll I'll be the I'll be there for all the days so check it out link is in the description um and and this is my game little bit of information about this game this was a title Tuesday game my opponent is a teenager from India strong player anytime you get an opponent from India you kind of brace yourself cuz you're like oh boy this person's quite strong and uh my opponent that I in this game did something I have to respond to a message uh did something completely ridiculous ah here we go the game began with a sicilian I played E4 my opponent played C5 every time we make a move we get a bonus second of time many lines that you can play against the Sicilian Defense but I played Knight C3 my opponent played Knight C6 and as we can see I have Sid step playing D4 there are many lines in the Sicilian Defense for white challenges for the center in this particular setup with Knight C3 E4 uh White can play F4 some of you might think this is a Vienna it's not it's called a Grand Prix attack but I did not choose to do that in this game and instead played Bishop B5 I've been playing this quite a lot recently with a good amount of success the idea is quite simply if black develops like this to take the Knight to put a Pawn on a light square and then yes play it in the style like that of a Vienna uh if you play the Vienna you know what I'm talking about in the style of a Grand Prix but if black drives their Knight into the center of the board trying to get your Bishop you actually don't touch your Bishop you develop another piece and basic basically what you're trying to do is say I'm developing while you're trying to get my bishop and believe it or not the best move is not to take the bishop history here has shown that black likes to leave the Knight and just like do play Waiting moves E6 A6 you know and and and sometimes even get out of the center and say well now your Bishop is kind of stupid right because you missed your chance to take me cuz I zipped out of the way um all of this to say that here my opponent played G6 would which is actually an inaccuracy it's already an inaccuracy it's very subtle but black wants to go here without moving these two pawns and it's an inaccuracy because I can play this move and the idea is to Target F7 quickly okay and so he played Bishop G7 and already I have a trap the computer doesn't even realize on a low depth how strong this trap is I take on D4 he takes on D4 and now rather than moving my knight I show the justification of this idea which is this move Queen F3 I'm threatening mate I'm just straight up threatening like a Scholar's mate but the the the hard thing about this move for black it's actually very difficult to defend against you might say no it's not what are you talking about I see like four ways to defend against it well the best way is Knight H6 and then I would try to Target the Knight and black equalizes after a very long set of moves but my opponent fell into my opening trap which is E6 this is a big trap this move defends mate but what it does is it opens up dark squared weaknesses and I pounce with Knight B5 and this is the value of learning openings at a master level is your openings have very solid foundations but they also have these trappy lines that your opponent can easily fall into now at this point many people prevent this move by playing the move D6 which only further falls into the Trap because you have Queen A3 nobody sees Queen A3 coming from a distance Queen A3 simultaneously puts pressure on this pawn and also pins the pawn to The Rook so in the future a move like A6 doesn't actually threaten the Knight because you're pinning and then you can like grab this Pawn they go here discovered attack you play Bishop B5 check etc etc okay that was the idea of Knight to B5 here my opponent played this move and already I knew this looks really bad and I got to be much better and I was and I found the best move which is Pawn to C3 BAS basically I you know my opponent's going to act quickly they want to kick my KN out so I need to Target my opponent's best asset which is this really annoying Center pawn and I'm trying to just take with the Knight and if they take you know I can bring my knight back to safety I can also take and build a big Center and that was the point I played C3 and already I have a like a like a 30se second time Advantage much better position from the opening this should be a 20 move game for white white should just win this game because they are more familiar with the opening they caught their opponent where they weren't ready opponent made a series of bad moves and now we're going to win but if I did all of that the video would not be called wow so my opponent took my Pawn okay the first thought I had was take back play D4 reason I wouldn't do that is because they would go A6 and so I would need to move my knight I can't play D4 because after take take take I lose two pieces they lose one that's really bad so I didn't do that so then I thought what should bring then then I but if I bring the Knight back I don't have D4 I lose control of the center I need a pawn there so then I put it all together I put it all together Pawn takes C3 I won't take back I will put the pawn on D4 now see the difference between putting the pawn on D4 a move later is they get the pawn there but I will play D4 now and when I saw this which you see it took me a few seconds just four seconds 5 Seconds cuz I got a Bonus I I was like oh I'm winning I'm already winning winning and I am winning I mean I have a near plus one advantage and the point is that the bishop has to choose which way it goes backwards and both ways are terrible if you go back this way I play Knight D6 King f8 E5 and you resign because if you can't move the bishop you just resign you resign the game I mean you resign in a few moves if you play Bishop B8 then I will come back you you have a really idiotic setup you have horrible swiss cheese position and I will continue my attack so I thought well I'm winning and I thought he's going to take and I'm going to take back and then he still got to move the bishop as you can see it's a massive Advantage for white I'm down upon but the bishop is getting hit around like a Piata but then unfortunately here a devil appeared on my shoulder and I started getting too creative and when you're when you don't know how to make toast you don't know how to fry an egg on a on a pan but you want to make a a beautiful beautiful sule where you put alcohol on the pan and then it Flames up the house is going to burn down okay so in this position I saw the following sequence of moves Pawn takes Bishop Pawn takes Rook Knight D6 check Queen F7 is mate that's how you calculate in chess the way you're supposed to calculate in chess is Pawn takes Bishop Pawn takes Rook Knight D6 check King moves Queen f s is mate does that mean you play that no in chess you must find ways to prove yourself wrong not prove yourself right so I tried to prove myself wrong Pawn takes Bishop Pawn takes Bishop check o that stops my idea I can't go here but after Pawn takes Pawn takes Bishop check here I still threaten Knight D6 I'm I'm crushing Queen A5 check does not scare me I just move my king out of the way and Knight D6 is next so I thought this is easy this is very easy D4 I thought I'd just take the bishop I calculated this calculated this but I forgot to look for checks and so I played this and I lose I lose in 10 moves completely lost why because it's not about Pawn takes Rook or Pawn takes Bishop my opponent plays Queen a five check now I have a very brutal decision to make I can move my king I can undevelop but then I don't threaten this and then if I undevelop I am just down a full Queen there's a new Queen that's really really bad so I can't do that I also can't go here because then I'm down a queen and it's check if Bishop D2 my opponent queens and then can do anything I mean they can sack the queen for the bishop and then they can do this and then I'm just busted so I was like oh my God I have to move the king but it's it's really bad it's not that they're going to take the bishop or The Rook the Knight is threatening mate right it's threatening this massive attack so he took my knight and this is where I was like oh my God why did I why did I not just kiss kiss something that I hope all of you get to experience one day true love but in ch kiss is keep it simple stupid keep it simple stupid no need there was no need to be like I'm going to S this and this bada bing bada boom now he now now now he finds this gorgeous tactic and I lose CU he sacks his Queen to win a rook and a queen back he's going to get the whole Queen back and he's going to get a knight and a rook and that's it h i could have resigned I could have resigned I I you know but I I couldn't I didn't have the ego I I did not have the ego to resign this position I am down six points of material um I have a little bit of activity like in chess there are things that matter material King safety peace activity Pawn structure right you know my king is not that safe but I'm going to that's why I wanted to tuck him over here material I'm dead lost uh piece activity you know Black's pieces kind of suck and I I would be willing to bet actually if you put like a400 to play with black they would struggle to get out cuz you got a lot of weaknesses you got to understand like this position is completely losable for uh if you're playing this with black so I brought my Rook cuz I have to use what I have even at the cost of a pawn even at the cost of a pawn with a check cuz I needed to get my king away the only chance you have of coming back in a game like this is if you're King is safe so I I had to Castle by hand my opponent grabbed the pawn they are now up seven points of material I didn't hang my Bishop I defended my Bishop gave another Pawn away the idea there was that if I give another Pawn away he will help me move my king to cor I'm now down eight points of material I'm down three pawns and a rook he went 97 so again the reason I say this is a position that's quite losable is um for example like let's say he goes A6 I attack his Queen he plays Queen D4 all of a sudden white can win a rook like it there's enough tactics in the position that you could accidentally blunder something with all these diagonal my opponent didn't he's a good player played 97 I thought all right I'm going to go to the diagonal he's going to Castle the one and only way to make a comeback in a game where you're down eight points is to Checkmate like no other sport has this Harry Potter has this like quiditch you could be up a lot of points you catch the golden snitch you win right unless well you win but you could be down like a bunch of points you don't I I don't actually know how that works quidditch math somebody could tell me in the comments I like when you guys educate me based on my nonsense that I Babble like I thought the Golden Stitch was like 500 points or whatever 150 points 200 points I don't know but if you're down a lot does it even count anyway in any sport if you're down eight goals you got to score eight goals there's no like it's it's like in football all right let's say say like you know Real Madrid's playing Bayern and they're up 3-1 the only way that Bayern is going to make a comeback in that game is if they if they score goal you can't like punch the other team in the face that doesn't but in chess you can and you know you can try to go for mate now the only reason I didn't go for mate now is cuz my opponent hasn't been kicked in the head by a horse so he would have you know he would have saw that so I tried to be subtle I tried to sneak in right and the other thing you play for in games like this is time now the unfortunate thing for me is he gets it's a bonus second every move now he offers a queen trade I say no he goes here I bring the bishop in now if I could just teleport my queen there I would win the game no now I if now the only option I have is teleporting my queen to h8 so that doesn't work I officially defend my king completely and now the rest of the game for him should be spent getting his Bishop out clogging up the center and he wins he wins it's not even close I would even play like B5 just give up a pawn with a tempo make me make a move sometimes in Chess By the way you can lose material you can trade a bishop for a rook but what's going to happen at the end of this sequence is black is still up a knight and two pawns so in chess you can simplify you could be up a rook in three pawns or a night and two you're probably still going to win and I have less pieces that way I didn't like how he played this he played very passively and not only that he didn't just play passively look at his time spend he's down to 29 seconds now that could be cuz he's playing me and he's terrified cuz he's going to end up in a YouTube video and by the way he's not wrong he's in a YouTube video right now we're both guilty of what you're about to see we are both guilty of crimes against the chz gods that is what you're about to witness D6 now I realized what was happening with this move he was trying to trap my Bishop like my original intention was Bishop takes Knight and if he takes it's literally Mateen one right like I just win that's the only way I have a chance of winning right or his internet could give out he took like this though and that was my last chance because the truth is if if I tried to sneak in he would go E5 and then I would try to sneak in to H6 and he would play literally any move but once he gets rid of my Bishop like even like this once he kicks me out it's over it's hopeless I this is not going to work so I'm still trying to be subtle I play Queen E3 now th this wins that's game over just just so we're clear it's game over he's got a couple of defensive moves here couple all right but he finds the best one Rook e eight doesn't work I take that's another way to get M it but you know I'm still creating threats dark squares around the king he finds a nice idea there is a move here that looks smart which is this nice idea Queen to E4 the idea of Queen to E4 is uh is to trade right like that's he wants to trade I can't play Queen H6 as a back rank M but what I could do here I could actually slide out of the way it's kind of a nice idea nice little Nifty idea can play Queen to D2 right so so here he can't stop that now kind of hilarious his Queen is hanging he can't stop this so what he would have to do he have to sa sack the queen so the best defense he actually finds it is attacking my bishop and when I saw this I I again I wanted to resign but I went here cuz I'm stubborn as a donkey and I was like I'm not resigning I'm going to move my bishop and then I'm going to offer this and then I'm going to go there there's no point of resigning I mean I'm going to lose the game any anyway right so you might as well he plays a nice idea plays H6 H6 is really smart because now I can't take cuz he takes my Bishop I have to guard my Bishop so I have to play this ugly move huge mistake here would be G5 because then that hangs and then he's mated then he has to sack his Queen and he's going to lose a lot of ways to lose this position a lot of you are taking this for granted if you're still watching this you're going this is so easy keep this is easy if you're like 2,000 if you're like, 1600 you still might find a way to lose this with black he goes Bishop D7 and now the idea is to trade the rook and uh I played H3 I played H3 for a very important reason no back rank mate no back rank mate it's not just blacks King we're hunting no back rank mate Rook e eight no Rook trade Rook e six I brought the bishop to the corner I brought the bishop as far away as possible in this position because of the bishop meme that that Meme that's been going around social media it's like you play Checkmate no the Bishop from from from v97 takes like a a one-way ticket right and I thought if I move my Bishop really far away he's going to forget that it's there which is which is extremely rude that's very insulting and here he played Queen C2 and I brought my Rook to safety I'm completely lost queen D4 does not threaten a mate he should play King H7 and he should forget about everything but then he weakened his King a little bit but then he defended it and now I have 17 seconds in he s 10 and let me just preface what you're about to witness as probably the most absurd sequence of events between two players over 2400 in history what proceeded to unfold here was a crime we should both be brought in front of a tribunal okay I took his Pawn I took his Pawn I'm hitting his Bishop I'm threatening this Pawn he could go back and defend himself but he went Rook F7 and I did what any person I grabbed another Pawn because why not right I'm playing without a rook this Pawn is useless the bishop in the corner is completely blocked I can give him a couple of checks it's hopeless he plays Bishop C6 Bishop C6 is a good move I have to give him a check he plays Rook E8 which is important and now I take another Pawn I'm just I'm taking I mean he's giving me pawns right so I got to take the pawns um I couldn't take the pawn a muo because he probably would have played like there and gotten this and discovered attack and again I would have just Pro none of that matters right Queen E4 so he threatens mate with eight seconds on the clock he's gaining a second every time he makes a move I play the move F3 I stop mate he gives me a check I block he defends his Bishop right so what do I do I give him a check he runs away I got no more checks so I played this move which is mysterious and here I did something very deliberate because there's bonus time I brought my clock really low I actually did that deliberately because I thought it would make him more nervous cuz I'm ready to lose this game BR I've been ready to lose this I've been ready to lose this game for 25 moves I literally lost this game on move 11 so at this point I'm playing on borrow time it's move 35 you know I grab a pawn I defend my king I'm like all right Queen B8 you know maybe maybe blun or something the way that you win this with black is you get a rook to the back rank that that's all you got to do Rook D7 Rook D1 Rook B7 Rook B1 I'm going to lose all my pieces you just have to not blunder Perpetual check that's it as black you got to make sure you don't blunder a Perpetual check which would end the game now he he gives me a couple checks I decide to move my king I don't give him any more satisfaction now he finds Rook B7 position's horrible you know I I go here just so my queen keeps an eye on all these pieces he could get the rook in but not exactly so he plays Rook B5 which I don't know what that does so I give him another check and I keep trying to hang around his King okay he goes Rook E5 Rook E5 actually blunders a rook but I think he did that on purpose or he was nervous if I take the Rook I lose my sniper so but I got to take the Rook right I mean that's what I got to do I gave him a check and he he now has to escape what he should have done obviously is he should have blocked that he should have not let me do that but there's actually a really nice way to blunder Queen F6 which is kind of scary that's kind of a scary thing so he runs his King out to the side of the board but there's nothing I can do if I play G4 I do more harm than good because of this and now I'm getting mated so there's no point for me to play G4 it's actually not the world's stupidest idea right I play here he takes King comes forward but there there's no possible way for me to deal any form of damage I am completely lost so I threaten a Checkmate except this not even a Checkmate it's not even a Checkmate this is not a mate cuz he has this in fact his position is so good he could just go here and if I take I got no checks he just plays Queen B2 and he and the King mates me with his bare hands Rook G1 bro has rookie1 like it's over I mean his King is completely safe Rook e one if I take Queen G2 is made if I don't take Queen G2 is made doesn't matter so I played that he went here same deal right same deal he's completely winning Okay so at this point I Got 5 seconds on the clock I can't make a single move I can't move any pieces so I start mindlessly shuffling my queen around the board and here here some Gotham fan must have sent my opponent money because I don't get what happens next the game is over he could go here and here and save his King and it's mate he could probably sack the bishop too he could probably play Bishop takes F3 right now and still win the game not the best move but it still works he went here attacking my Rook I told him he couldn't have it he went here which I don't know what that does I went here because I don't have any time and I thought that I was threatening Checkmate which I'm not threatening he could still go King G3 by the way he plays Queen G3 that move blunders a draw because I have this which threatens this and this if he goes back I can actually play Pawn to G3 check and that's actually very dangerous for him I don't do that though some garbage he grabs a pawn he just really hated that pawn it's off the board now now he's up a bishop and a pawn we both have like three and five four seconds I give him a check I lose the game F4 I'm helping his King get defended he's going to go Rook E1 he's going to go G4 the position's Hopeless I play Queen D2 it's now minus 12 it's it's worse than minus 12 there there's a there's a mate in there somewhere I attack his Bishop from the side so he gives it away for free he he moves the Bishop from one spot to another cuz he forgets that my queen can actually Target both of those squares the queen on her own has now officially captured enough material to save the day all right that Queen went on a spiritual journey I couldn't move any of my pieces and it just bothered his king that's all I did it's kind of instructive I just bothered his King I bothered his King bothered his King defended my king and then he hung his Bishop now it's a draw it's a draw because when we simplify to an end game it's three pawns versus four Pawns it's a draw okay so in this position he actually expedites that process he plays Rook e one he shouldn't have done that he he probably should have played Rook E5 or maybe Rook E2 by the way and so if I played a move like Queen F5 you know he could have kept bothering me a little bit but he decided just you know he panicked a little bit and he just lost his Bishop he's like I want to I want to play rookie one I knew he was going to play rookie one and rookie one actually is a is a kind of a draw by force if I take uh he can't mate me it's not possible like it looks like he can mate me but I'll take and then I'll take he's just he doesn't have enough time doesn't have enough time or pawns so I was like oh I saved the draw I'm so clever and so in this position I play this move Queen D2 Queen D2 protects the queen from invading the back rank I thought he would leave but he took and now he just plays G4 plays G4 we trade all the pawns we make a draw there is one thing I should avoid with white it's a queen trade too quickly for example if I take take maybe Queen F2 but like I shouldn't trade Queens because after something like Queen takes takes and even F5 I mean just mathematically speaking you do not want to trade into a pawn end game where you're down a pawn like it just doesn't make any sense so a queen end game down upon Pawn is fine a rook and game down upon Pawn probably fine King and pawn and game down upon Pawn not fine and so in this position my opponent can play G4 and my opponent can play F5 and he's going to March all the pawns down and he's going to win and he's going to at least save the game right he's going to at least draw the game but he goes here what what's the difference the difference is I know his next move now I know this but so what I knew his next move here what's the difference the difference is my opponent despite having a king a queen and four pawns put himself in Aang Aang in chess is a situation where any move makes your situation worse he has no legal king move he has no queen move every queen move loses a queen so his only move is G4 and that blunders the diagonal that is why the pawn had to remain on F6 because now his diagonal is open and any Queen placement is made and so in this position from being down eight points of material and having Checkmate on the board for about 10 moves in a row I slid my queen over one square and he could either lose his Queen to me or lose his King and I won this game from this position
