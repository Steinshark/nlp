ladies and gentlemen welcome to a very special video this video is 100% legitimate and is not any sort of clickbait whatsoever in this video I'm going to make a major announcement I'm going to tell you why I am making that announcement and I'm also going to show you two recent chess games that I've played against extremely strong Grand Masters and in one of them I actually defeated this grandm marking one of the best wins of my life also I'm currently in K or Cologne Germany uh and I will be making a couple of other stops in Europe before heading back home traveling a little bit mostly for uh pleasure but also going to a conference starting tomorrow so you will need to deal with my travel setup and I do apologize but the travel setup will be getting an upgrade on the next trip so no more of these hostage situations we will have good camera good audio Etc folks let's get into the announcement I am coming back to competitive over theboard play if you thought the candidates was a massive event in 2024 and the world championship is going to be an even bigger one in later 2024 I'm making a comeback to classical chess over the board that's a big deal because for me that means the next step will be The Grandmaster title we've got several steps in the way uh before we get there now I made this little list it's really ugly but like I said I'm traveling I want to quick LLY run through this with you for some of you that may be new to this whole journey of Grandmaster versus not Grandmaster uh some of you might remember some of my content in 2021 2022 and now I'd like to just elaborate further on that and I want to talk about what's going to be different this time so let's get into number one my road to International Master International Master is the second highest title in chess grandm is the highest I became an international master in 2018 at the age of 22 which is already pretty old and decrepit I was very close in 2016 when I was 19 years old and at that time I was teaching chess full-time so I made a decision in college to be a chess teacher to not pursue a corporate career this was 2016 17 18 around that time then I stopped and I was mostly teaching chess uh and uh I slowly lost some rating because I wasn't taking chess so seriously anymore now this whole road to GM thing that I did The Pursuit Of The Grandmaster title happened because I played a chess tournament in 2021 in Las Vegas and I didn't do badly and I like that you guys enjoyed the recap videos that I made you really liked me showing you my insights and my preparation so I thought you know what this would be good content like let me play some tournaments and uh let me uh make content for all of you and maybe maybe I'll achieve my goals no what I learned very quickly is that chess uh in this day and age is much more of a full-time job if you want to be a professional player and I was not able to fulfill those requirements and also what I realized is I was handling losses very horribly and I was letting you all know that in my recaps of these events but it was really really bad it was very bad for my mental in my preparation when I was training and I would make mistakes I would also get very angry and frustrated at myself it was very unhealthy environment to train and practice in and that's why I quit I quit because when I went to these events nothing felt good and everything felt bad the winds just felt routine there was no I and I was getting way too emotional but all kind of toward the negative side and having way too high expectations of myself and to be honest way too high expectations from you the audience like in some ways the the the hundreds of thousands of you that tuned into my recaps um it it it it you would think that you know for me I would feel the support and the love but I I felt pressure and I put that pressure on self to perform to to make everybody happy and fulfilled and I never felt pressure like that before and I decided you know this isn't making me feel any better it's just all making me feel worse so let me come back to it when I think I'm ready and that's why I'm coming back I'm coming back because I'm going to make an effort and I have been making an effort I've been training I've been studying I've been learning I've been trying to handle losses better I've been trying to to handle mistakes and training better to understand that this is a very long journey and I am inspired by guys like Hikaru who is playing in a you know just finished his second candidates backto back playing for first place or second place in the final round guys like gesh just ice cold you know in his veins and uh winning the candidates at 17 despite a massive setback in the middle and I feel like I can do it too and massive amount of Chess at the high level even at my level which is not the candidates level is ego and I have so much ego and I watch people who have higher ratings than me and I go they're not better than me now what makes it harder in my case is my opponents frequently play one person which is me I frequently play two people my opponent and myself and personally just on a on a selfish note I feel like if I am able to fulfill the goal of grandmas it will really be one of the truly special stories and I would love to share it with all of you uh I don't think I would allow myself to live to to to finish my journey in chess in content or anything without getting this title and for now I'm just going to take it step by step I'm not going to let bad results slow me down I'm going to improve my game and I'm coming at this with a fresh new mindset not always is going to be perfect but that is the update now when am I playing June in June I'm organizing helping organize this event in Spain with Jose Martinez and Vladimir kramnick The Clash of claims if you don't know about the Clash of claims I have a YouTube video about The Clash of claims uh and I'm going to play a chess tournament in Spain in June so the countdown to this tournament is something like 40 to 50 days and then we'll see what happens next in the future very exciting stuff and now please allow me to share with you two games that I recently played against 3,000 rated opponents on ch.com I have been playing at a very high level I have not been winning or drawing as many games against strong Grand Masters at as I would like to share with all of you but I'm back to serious competition most things that I'm going to do now regarding training and learning are going to be with a long-term goal of getting my rating out of the absolute trash can that it currently is improving my chess improving my rating and motivating all of you you can do it too let's do this together The Grandmaster title for me has been the biggest failure and the biggest shortcoming and the biggest point of frustration for my entire life and I'm nearly 30 years old and I'm still going to fight and I'm not going to give it up that easily and I'm coming at this with a brand new fresh feeling now in this game first game my my opponent is Grandmaster sonon Shugo and he started the game with Pawn to D4 um I responded with Pawn to D5 and C4 I took on C4 the Queen's Gambit accepted we actually saw gesh just play this against Hikaru uh in the candidates tournament when he played this move Bishop to E7 uh but rather than Bishop to E7 which I suppose is a legitimate weapon of some sort um I just play C5 castles and again here you can play Bishop E7 which is kind of what gukesh did against hikaro although hikaro played Knight C3 A3 what I did here is I is I took on D4 right away and I've had this approach recently especially against really strong players you know against things like the Queen's Pawn what I do against them is I'll play like the modern you know and and Hikaru plays like this a lot and I'll give them the center and I'll try to fight but the truth is I'm giving very good players a little bit too much Central Advantage early on in the game and then I'm fighting back the entire time so I sort of thought you know what why don't I play like this this is a bit more traditional this is Queen's Pawn this is an isolated Pawn so white is going to try to use the open lines and in these isolated Queen Pawn positions or IQs uh the the queen usually slides out of the way gets reinforced by the rook and white puts a knight here and goes on some sort of attack what do I want I want to blockade that square with some of my pieces like my knight or my Bishop I want to trade a couple of pieces as well uh and I want to do that so I don't get checkmated and also that pawn is a liability in the long run so Bishop 2 E7 Queen E2 and now what I like to do here is I like to play this move A6 and the idea is that I want to go B5 but the funny thing is B5 is actually not scary whatsoever white can play Knight C3 B5 Bishop D3 or Bishop B3 and just continue to try to go here like I'll play Bishop B7 but it's nothing special but what sonan did uh is sonan played this move A4 and this does prevent the move B5 but it grants me immediate access to the dark squares which normally he would have a Pawn on A3 and he would prevent me from getting there so I danced right away to the B4 Square controlling the knight uh controlling the square on D5 with both of my Knights and like I said if I'm able to control that square just you know worst case scenario for white something like Knight D5 and if we trade a bunch of pieces here black is just much better so I'm going to play B6 Bishop D7 or uh Bish Bishop B7 or Bishop D7 Bishop C6 Bishop F6 and I will have pressure forever I'll put my Rooks here and we're going to be in very good shape now sonan here plays this move A5 trying to still disallow me for moving over here but I was like okay Bishop to D7 fighting for this diagonal ready to bring my rook and from the opening I would say only black is happy I mean I basically achieved everything that I wanted and even though he is standing quite actively now immediately I jump to the center of the board I'm targeting his Bishop I'm targeting this Knight I've got the the strong Rook I'm looking to put my Bishop here and this these are the kind of games I want to bring to these guys sonan is one of the you know strongest Grand Masters I think he transferred out of Russia I think now he represents Hungary as I would say there from his CHL atcom flag but he was 2700 Fay and he's like 3,000 on ch.com and I don't think it's ridiculous of me to say things like look I want to be a Grandmaster but even if I become a Grandmaster tomorrow he's going to be a better player than me and in this game he's got nothing on me absolutely nothing and now I play Bishop to F5 I activate the bishop on the diagonal and um from this point forward I'm playing for an advantage you know and this is what I have to mentally do against these these Grand Masters is I have to stop being so afraid I have to stop being so nervous that at any point they can call the shots now one of the things I definitely do very poorly is time manage now look at my clock right this move in 20 seconds not necessary to spend that level of time right this move in another 12 seconds you know he plays Rook C1 which luckily for me uh gets the time back to equal in fact I can take and right away I realized he actually blundered because he can't Lo he's going to lose this Pawn so now I go Bishop to D6 which again 13 seconds to move a square not really good but I was a little bit concerned here Queen C7 rookie 8 F6 all different possibilities he brings the bishop to D2 now in the game I considered going to C2 and making the trade chess is all about decisions I decided to pin him instead another 10 seconds Queen to F3 and now I come back to E6 we're very even on time right he plays this move H3 just kind of a Passback move now he's down on the clock I put some pressure on his night but I spent nearly 20 seconds on that move time management very very bad all right something that we need to improve over the next months now at this point I couldn't handle the pressure anymore and what I really should have done is just played a move like H6 just pass the move back to my opponent like you everything is defended in the position like if I play H6 he's going to go Rook C1 but the incredible thing about this move is not only doesn't not do anything it just straight up blunders a pawn so he can't move like as long as I keep my queen on C7 everything is fine but I felt the pressure and I thought I need to make a trade right now and when he took my night I started having second thoughts and was like well if I take you know this Pawn is weak and you know he's going to win it and then he's going to like leave my position and then he's going to promote and and you know all these thoughts and I said ah why did I do that let me trade with the and I blundered Bishop pay for I blundered a skewer now it's Blitz stupid stuff happens all the time right this was very dejecting because this is the exact way I lose to guys like sonan 20 moves into the game absolutely no problems completely playing on his level or you could argue he's playing on mine but let's just make me feel better and then I just you know I don't know what to do and instead of just playing a a normal move I I I want to get rid of one of his pieces cuz I'm I'm scared you know and then and and and then and then I blunder I blunder at this and I'm gutted right like this is this is so frustrating to me and [Music] um all right well I guess it's time to quit right it's time to quit on this game no no no no I don't quit on this game at all actually I activate my queen make sure he can't Checkmate me and say you have to beat me like it's Rook for Bishop but how are you getting into my position all of my pawns are protected you can't move any of these pawns sonan I'm not going to trade Queens with you and if you try to push these pawns you're going to weaken your king and suddenly I got a second wind of energy here and was like I don't see how he's going to win this game he went G3 I went Queen back to D7 and I was like wait I'm actually really confused how is he going to win not only how how is he going to win look at all these weaknesses weaknesses that he's created and suddenly after takes takes and just Bishop B4 I was like wait a minute uh I I I'm sorry like isn't isn't white in serious trouble and I have 4 seconds on the clock which is not what I should have done right I should have played fast I should have just put the pressure on him but I was very frustrated and I got over here and the position's back to equal and we both have 5 seconds on the clock so I completely fight back from a losing position and this guy has 3,000 I mean it's literally the best that I can do right and at this point he has to sacrifice his Rook now this is a bit scary the fact that the pawn is three squares away from queening right and I only have three seconds to make a decision well what the computer wants is the computer wants me to take a Pawn on the way out and against this it wants me to find the counter punch E3 which is not you can't find that with 3 seconds point being that if he goes here I have a fork and I win uh the pawn and if this I play Queen H3 he gets a square away from queening and apparently this is a draw because I I just catch him in this Loop but that's really tough to find so instead I go back and now I'm in trouble again and I got close but unfortunately now I'm just suffocating behind this pawn and I can't really get out of the way he just keeps putting pressure and I panic a little bit and ultimately I run out of checks he's going to make a queen it takes him 51 moves and he gets the pawn through but I was very happy to have made it back to this position like this was uh this was this was a very nice feeling that you know it's really never over and this game was kind of was a typical Gotham game where I play a 3,000 I play a perfectly reasonable opening but then I sort of hesitate and I spend my time worse and um if I can just get a a few less of these like one in four of these types of games I start flipping and I make draws or I get wins oh it's going to be really really nice and speaking of this is one of the strongest Grandmasters that I've ever beaten this is this this is Andrew Hong in fact Andrew Hong beat me in a classical game on his quest to Grandmaster Andrew Hong also beat me like in 2018 I was paired against him and I had no idea who he was and he very quickly let me know who he was by menacingly Whispering I'm Andrew Hong I'm Andrew Hong amandre hung to me throughout the game no that would be extremely antisocial um by just beating me so I'm actually 0 and2 against him uh and I don't think we've ever played a Blitz game against each other yeah this was our first ever game and he's very good he always plays against Taro um he played a very weird opening uh and it got tactical very early with Knight to E4 uh I played this move Knight to E2 which is trying to play Pawn to D3 the opening was very obscure he played E6 I kicked his Knight out and then I went here trying to go after his Bishop now something really strange happened in the opening right here I went Bishop to E2 and he spent a lot of time and he went here and he's uh sorry in this position he spent uh quite a bit of time I don't know why it's not being reflected here he spent a lot of time yes okay perfect Bishop E2 H5 and I went H3 attacking his bishop and he spent a minute here which I can only imagine had to do with Bishop takes F3 he didn't like the fact that my Bishop was going to be so strong with ideas like Rook to B1 or A3 B4 I guess he really just got worried about the activity of my Bishop not to mention the fact that like at the end of the day there's a hanging Pawn on H5 so he just didn't like that it was going to be a fork and he thought for a while uh after H5 and he actually played this move H4 which to me was really strange um because he's just straight up sacrificing material so he got way too aggressive way too early I mean what he should have done is you know probably in this position just gone Bishop F5 like that's what I thought he was going to do and then maybe he was worried about Knight to H4 but I thought okay I mean worse comes to worst he can even play G6 it's not you know and and then if I take he's going to take with the E Pawn and Bishop F3 play Queen D7 and Knight E6 and like he's going to be fine but he didn't like something he played H4 and I was like wait what aren't I just winning his Rook yes that was part but he gets my bishop and he gets it with a check and you know now I and now he goes F6 trying to create some counterplay so again I have made a career losing games like this to players like Andrew I mean he's like 350 points higher rated than me and Blitz he's going to be very creative he's going to be very fast uh I think his Peak Blitz rating is like 31 150 or 3200 he plays hiar all the time like I said maybe I didn't say that so I need to figure out a way I'm going to kill his counterplay right so first I take on F6 right I spent 23 seconds on Pawn takes Pawn that's crazy but I took he took and now I thought you know what let's make this very easy let's play Queen to H1 and trade the queens and with no Queen he can't beat me right so Queen H1 now the reason I didn't go Queen H1 is cuz I didn't really like Knight B4 not now but just in the future right now it doesn't work because I take on it here but I was like he's going to Castle and then he's going to play Knight B4 so before I went Queen H1 I decided I would play A3 all right now he cannot put the Knight on B4 and not only can he not now I'm going to play B4 myself so he castled and I indeed went Queen H1 so now the Rook is always protected and queen H5 is a massive threat like just so you understand it's plus 1.9 or whatever and in this position it's plus three and a half cuz he has no counterplay all right I'm not better than Andrew at chz but I'm better than him enough that I would beat him here 10 out of 10 times it's a very winning position um maybe one time I would like disconnect or have a heart attack uh Queen H1 he goes back to D6 and you know I got to tell you right now is when I started to get quite nervous because if you look at Andrew's time management I mean he was down a minute and he's not anymore and he's going to start going e54 and he's going to open the position so I really got to focus I got to buckle down and I'm like okay okay I know he wants to go E5 and I know he wants to go Knight D5 Knight E3 so now I need to evaluate what am I stopping what do I care about so I went Queen H5 right now I expected Knight D5 and there it was but at this point I was like okay so he's going to put the Knight on E3 and then what and what's he going to do when the Knight arrives on E3 because let me tell you something if he takes this Pawn I get the Rook to the open file not only do I get the Rook to the open file I could also go there and get the Rook with the other rook and the queen like I actually don't think the C2 Pawn is important this Pawn is a check and it is important which is why I'm going to move it up and I'm close on time Knight G4 check not a concern I'm going to play King to G1 now Andrew blows open the center of the board it's a very tense moment it says plus 3.2 but let me tell you when you're playing a game like this and your opponent is rated 3,35 this a very dangerous move and I was very happy to come up with a very practical solution I can take I can take I can do all this different stuff but at the end of the day when a pawn makes it to the other side of the board it becomes a queen I don't know if you knew that G6 he could take on F4 I'm not going to take I'm not going to take because then he's going to get his Queen and his Knight in I'm just going to go G7 he could take both my Pawns in fact he's taking this one with h check but I play King to G1 none of his pieces can get to my king and his pieces are collapsing he goes Bishop takes G7 we're going to turn this back on immediately I take because now this is also a guaranteed Rook trade he plays G2 to Anchor in his uh Pawn with his Knight and I trade this off and if we just pause here I'm upper Rook but like I told you in the beginning of this video when I play people they don't just play me rather I don't just play them I also play myself at this point all that's in my head is don't mess this up whereas if I was playing somebody lower rated than me it would be why is this idiot not resigning and that's something I'm going to have to work to change and I am actively trying to change that in my games so I played Pawn C3 13 seconds don't love that time spend but I had to get rid of his Pawn in the center he play plays Knight to E6 I bring the queen back to G3 he plays C5 now I don't even think I got to open the center all right I got no choice I have to open up the center of the board he plays Pawn takes D4 I don't think for a second I need to activate my Rook he goes King D7 now I'm thinking here I'm looking at Queen H3 Queen H7 I can't quite get in and you know when I'm low on time I'm thinking simple tactics Knight takes Pawn that removes the defender of the Knight on E3 so if he takes right I'm gonna go here now he has Queen here and this is a bit scary because he is threatening stuff against my king like Knight takes E2 but I thought here for a second and was like hold up I could just take his Pawn so now all he has is Queen B2 defending his Knight pressuring my Bishop pressuring my Rook which is what he does and this was the most important moment of the game cuz right around here as you can see from my time spend I've got 20 seconds and I'm already entering panic mode and I play rookie one and I just kind of exhale because I realize there is a fork but I think what I was going to do here is I was just going to counter by going directly for his King so my queen and my Rook are both hanging but he's got to go like here for example and then I was going to go Queen E6 and that's not the Checkmate but King C5 and then here and then bring my rook and luckily I Checkmate him he goes back to C6 and now I'm like okay let's protect our King we have 20 seconds he can get this he's up a couple pawns but now I'm out here with my Bishop now I'm going first king C7 no checks okay fine I'm going to give him one more check and he didn't like Knight to E5 because I guess he thought I was going to take on F6 like I can take here and then give him this check and then win this and I'm going to win Queen and Rook versus queen so he goes Queen D6 I'm like oh easy that's a WP we don't even think we give a check we win the pawn now the only thing I need to worry about is accidentally allowing two runaway pass pawns to Queen which you might accidentally do in time trouble if you blunder what he would really love to do here if given the chance like let's just say I waste some time because I'm stupid uh very quickly his Advantage will get really high and uh now it's back to equal so he will then also put his Knight on E5 so I was like okay Rook F6 equ goes B5 now I'm thinking okay how do I stop his pawns first of all let's start bringing our King we know that it's the end game we know we get a couple of easy moves right now he plays A5 so I'm very very nervous here right so I played this move I just bring my king two squares closer I'm definitely in the Square he plays Knight to D4 now I need to make sure my king rook and Bishop are very far apart from each other right so I I do this and the point is that now there's no way to blunder a fork and The Rook is most powerful when it's attacking from the other side and and I made a goal here I want to stay up at least above 10 seconds on the clock de4 check I found a nice tactic if he takes I play Rook to C8 removing the king from the defense of the Knight very slowly he goes King D6 back now Rook F6 check King here Bishop F3 I'm still above 10 seconds and I'm still putting my pressure now I play D5 because now actually my Pawn is very powerful King is going to D4 I played that move a little bit slowly all right A4 now suddenly I'm panicking I'm officially panicking because how am I going to stop the pawn so I play Bishop to E4 with 4 seconds remaining Bishop to E4 with the idea Rook to F2 A3 Rook F1 so I don't ever blunder this and now my king is going to go to D4 he brings his King I bring my king and he's kind of stopped but I have 4 seconds on the clock every move he's making is super fast here I completely miss that I have Rook F6 because I just wanted to play defense I just wanted to stop both of these pawns and I do this is very scary but he gets here Rook C1 check King D4 and I'm like wait a minute Rook C4 here Rook C6 and there we go my king is stopping both pawns at the same time he plays Knight D7 the last moment don't blunder anything stupid King B4 is a very nice way to lose everything lose everything but I stay calm I play rookie seven and I don't care if he can give me this check because I just step back if he takes I take and I promote he can't do anything he goes King C3 I play D7 there's nothing there is absolutely nothing everything is covered B3 I win the pawn I win this and uh I win everything and now I just have to not lose the game on time it was much easier to just pre-move a little bit I cut him off and I walk him down and you know he could have resigned of course but it's the end of a Blitz game and I won and this was probably like my fifth highest rated win on CHL come um and I was very very proud of it and it shows that granted my opponent played a little bit of a goofy opening and got himself into trouble I held my nerves I panicked only very mildly but I still held my nerves I won the game and I'm more than capable and there are going to be games where you know I have these moments and I fail and there's going to be moments where I have these uh these games where I have these moments and I don't fail and I just need to slowly but surely start making slow changes and that is what's going to be different can go back to full screen for a second that is the announcement that is kind of the road map and um I'm going to play tournaments I'm going to play tournaments because I want to prove it to myself I'm going to play tournaments because it's unfinished business I'm going to play tournaments because it's good content I think a lot of you enjoyed me uh talking about my preparation and uh my thoughts and feelings and my own analysis and that's uh that's what I'm going to share with you and I'm not going to think solely and so much uh about the result and that's going to be uh what's going to be different this time around so that's the announcement in case the candidat wasn't exciting enough get out of here
