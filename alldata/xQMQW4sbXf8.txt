we've told you this so many times buying used hard drives is not worth risking your data but sometimes offer you just cannot refuse we took that risk and bought eight used hard drives from eBay totaling 136 terabytes for two thousand dollars that's almost half the price compared to new really impressive savings but just like buying a used GPU on eBay there's a real chance that new to you high capacity hard drives were used for crypto mining so is even this great deal worth it if there's a chance your parts arrive with one foot already in the grave I'll tell you where and why these drives are popping up for sale what red flags to look out for and when you should consider making an exception to the don't buy used hard drives rule right after I tell you how to make an exceptional segue to our sponsor ridge ridge wallet has redefined the traditional wallet with its compact frame and RFID blocking plates the Bulge in your pants shouldn't be from your wallet dang it use offer code Linus to save 10 and get free worldwide shipping all right the shameful truth is this isn't even the first time we've bought you storage my personal hard drives are from a dead Nas and are currently Dying Years Ago Linus splurged on 24 used ssds for a server at home but the only reason he was comfortable taking that risk was that he had been reassured by another buyer the ssds were in good health so he bought them this time though we don't have that luxury but what we do have are some very attractive prices two hundred dollars for 16 terabytes when the cheapest new drive with the same capacity would be in the neighborhood of 300 so why are they so cheap supply and demand wow a huge volume of drives are being dumped on eBay Marketplace and the like some from Everyday People some that were refurbished and some from unscrupulous users that use the hard drive to mine cryptocurrencies but how much does that hurt them well there are many coins you can mine on a hard drive today we tried it in the past the most popular by far is chia mining it was so popular at launch in May 2021 that Seagate was even considering making an entire line of cryptocurrency specific hard drives sure anyway Chia mind hard drives should be pretty safe to buy since Chia runs on a proof of space algorithm so once the drives are filled with the plot data from Chia to prove the space or capacity very little read or write activity is required while mining that space on the drive that means that drives used in Chia mining are barely used which is enough justification for us to roll the dice on eBay we settled on two 16 terabyte WD UltraStar HC 5500s two 16 terabyte Seagate XO 16x's that one yeah this one right here and four 18 terabyte and now they're here let's compare what was advertised with what we actually got our two WDS were listed with up to 2100 hours of power on yeah not so much we got drives with 2300 and 2600 hours a bit above the stated value but in the grand scheme of things those extra 10 or 20 days of power on time aren't really a big deal on the flip side the seagates were expected to arrive with up to 11 000 power on hours and instead they just had like 234 213 hours damn score but still is that a lot or a little in the Enterprise world the expected lifetime is around 45 000 hours but anecdotally some of our staff have drives with 50 to 60 000 hours ultimately it's hard to say when a drive is too old to use higher hour drives are typically cheaper but they also might not last as long only you can decide if it's worth it for your needs but we'd recommend 20 maybe 25 000 hours as a safe ceiling lastly our four Toshiba drives the packaging just speaks for itself this is what our other drives came in uh you can see here ESD bags this foam hold your hard drives in and this is how the Toshiba has arrived not great for mechanical devices with moving Parts like just look at the SATA connectors on this one I noticed that the corner is just completely passionate on this one oh it's just actually broken fantastic a quick sound check on the Toshibas tells us the other drives were damaged as well huge bummer unfortunately this buyer didn't accept our returns but no matter the buyer protection on eBay is excellent and we're able to use the money back guarantee to get our cash back but physical condition and Power on hours aren't the only way to diagnose our drives it's time to pull the rest of the smart data thanks to the cloud backup and storage systems experts at backblaze we know that some parameters are better indicator of failures than others the combination of attributes 5187 188 and 197 and 198 can accurately predict an impending drive failure 76.7 percent of the time and how did our other drives fare flying colors it's golf rules and we have zeros across the board or at least as far as we could tell see every Drive manufacturer has different ideas about which of the many specific smart attributes they should monitor Seagate gave us all five while neither WD or Toshiba include 187 and 188 one blemish though was that despite its low power cycle and on hours count attribute 199 on one of our Seagate exos drives was flagged as concerning this rather nebulous error count increases when there are infinitesimally short drops in communication between the controller on the hard drive and the SATA controller on the motherboard during a data transfer operation these drops are almost exclusively caused by things like a bad or lucida connection or a faulty SATA controller on the host system so ultimately they're safe to ignore so long as they aren't reoccurring and if you confirmed the cabling and the controller are both good the final thing we can glean from our smart data is the evidence of crypto mining farming whatever we're looking at threes specific signs high power on hours are relatively low number of total reads compared to those power on hours and a total right amount that is roughly equal to the size of the drive although that's no guarantee with a quick conversion and a little math we can see our Seagate drives have a total reads and writes that are staggeringly high given their 250 ish power on hours it's also roughly twice their capacity which according to our friend Wendell from level one text could be due to one of the Integrity checks that might run while refurbishing a truck and lo and behold they've been etched to say they are recertified weird since there was nothing about that in the listing oh well we can only speculate on their history but it's possible these are gray Market drives from a batch of drives that had their tilt indicators tripped during shipping or were sent back as an open box return drive failure is mostly common when a drive is new they may be DOA or fail within a couple days of use so these drives could have been through all of that before being recertified and then sold to us checking the Seagate website for warranties has both drives report back not warranted by Seagate which in theory means that the recertifying company offers an alternative warranty and this 30-day seller warranty is exactly that 30 days isn't quite the five years that Seagate offers from authorized sellers but it's a heck of a lot more than zero days plus they are WD drives continued their trend of ignoring useful features and chose not to log total reads and writes thanks WD this makes it difficult for us to even speculate on their history but at only a hundred or so days of power on time it seems unlikely they are part of a farm because having their patience to allow those rewards to slowly accumulate is essential for returning a profit especially when Factory in upfront costs and power consumption and you should factor in the power you feel with a screwdriver from lttstore.com they're actually very good now it's time to do something with these drives seeing as we have this much storage on hand let's do it to make just a janky DIY Nas and compare its price to an off-the-shelf pre-built Mass the key night among you may have already knows though that we paid more for our 16 terabyte drives than our eight teams so it seems like a good time to note that we had some time constraints that prevented us from getting the absolute best bang for a buck on the hard drive namely we wanted to get a variety of different drives from different Sellers and they had to be able to ship it to us up in Canada further limiting our choices our best deal was easily the recertified Seagate drives that came with an 80 gigabyte per dollar compared to 50 to 55 gigabytes per dollar brand new that's two used drives for the price of one and a half brand new and if you happen to need a drive we'll have the links for both new and used down in the description oh here we go oh wow that's heavy good old steel chassis assuming we converted our trustial 69 gaming PC into an ass and assuming we loaded it with these 16 terabyte seagates which ideally within the toshiba's if they worked and then you factor in some money for cables and a hard drive cage we are sitting right around 71 gigabytes per dollar meanwhile a pre-configured Nas with that much storage space comes in at 1622 meaning 39.5 gigabytes per dollar what could you do with that extra 720 how about buying another three full hard drives or building a whole other PC not to mention that the 69 PC can still do all the normal things you expect a PC to do while a dedicated Nas has a singular purpose but it's not just about spending Less on your Nas project you can also afford to buy more drives that you can dedicate to parity for example choosing to go with raid 5 instead of raid 1. those used drives may be less reliable overall but at some point the extra redundancy makes it the safer move but there's a few things we haven't touched on so far with this price discussion sales on new hard drives and shocking shocking hard drives involves buying a drive generally intended to be used externally and removing all the unnecessary bits to just get to the 3.5 inch hard drive inside as an example you could pick up one of these 18 terabyte external WD My Books brand new for 280 per Drive meaning 64 gigabytes per dollar substantially closer to the cost of a used Drive than to the cost of one that was intended to be used internal all along as for sales on new drives this is essentially a matter of patience we've seen the price of a brand new 18 terabyte drive fall as low as 300 a new 16 terabyte drives have gone on sale for 245. again not as cheap as used but it's got a lot of benefits like a full warranty known history and zero power on hours with all that said though can I ultimately recommend using used hard drives it's all going to come down to just your personal Comfort level with risk if you are storing something easily replaceable like Steam games or media files you might be pretty excited to get a bunch of capacity or redundancy for the same amount of money but if you're storing family photos or important documents well those are worth a heck of a lot more than a game save to most people and also just use steam Cloud saves and knowing they're on a new Drive might help you feel more at ease regardless of what drives you end up with you should have a good one two three backup strategy in place things three copies of your data on two separate mediums with one stored off site I personally prefer the one one one one drive already failing one location s about risk aren't something we can answer for you it's up to each individual to decide on their own but for our part yeah it's kind of worth the risk we've definitely had a bunch of change of opinion on used drives and we'll be considering them in future want to
