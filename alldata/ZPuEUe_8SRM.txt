- We hit 10 million subscribers and to celebrate, I brought down my third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, and 10th million subscriber and had them compete against
each other for $100,000 and 10 million underscore,
underscore, underscore. Filling in for my 10th
million subscriber is Chris. I thought it would make more sense to let Chris compete in this tournament because he's been here since day one. So Chris is our technical
10th million subscriber. The rules are simple, 10 games. You get points placed on how you rank. - Yes.
- Come in first, you get 30 grand, last place gets nine. You already know the rules. You gonna win? - I'm probably gonna be last place. - At least you're realistic. - Yeah. - Are you gonna win?
- Yeah. - Are you gonna come in first? - I'm absolutely coming in first place. - Are you gonna come in first? - Of course. - You gonna win? - Yeah, oh yeah. - That's what the other
three guys said, so. The first of the 10 games they
competed in was "Skribbl". It was a little hectic and hard to follow, but Roger won was seven points. Chris got second and got
six points, et cetera. And remember, the person
with the most points after all 10 games gets $30,000 and 10 million underscore,
underscore, underscore. Roger. - Yeah.
- Got that dough, man. - Let's go, yep. - Dude, you're on track today. - I had to, you know, I had to. - The second game they played was "GMod". - No! - No!
- No! - Big shouts!
- Are you kidding? - The full game was extremely long, so I'm not gonna show it all, but it came down to a tie
between Chris and Tyler. So the only logical thing
to do was to have them duke it out in "Rock Paper Scissors" to see who would get the most points. - Boom! First place! - And Tyler got second. So Chris, Tyler, Roger. - All right.
- Top three. The third game was the
"Chicken Capture" game, and it was pretty boring. Here's who won? Great job, everyone, great job! You're currently in the lead. 3 of the 10 games are down. - Hey. - Do not win. They're gonna think this is rigged. - I was the first subscriber. I earned my rank here. I'm going to try my utmost hardest. - This is true, you did earn your rank. Now, here's where the real fun begins. The fourth game they
competed in was "Brawlhalla". - All right, let's do this, boys. - Three, two, one, brawl! - Son of a . - Sick, are you? - Chink me, you piece of . - All right. - This is the key right now. - That's funny. - Dude. - All that fighting and there you are. - Yeah, God, I expect one. Let's go back into it. - Who is this other guy? - Leave me alone, leave me alone! - Okay, cheap shit. - Yeah!
- Someone please. - You got a kill. You got a kill, man, let's go. - Wow, that hurts, what the hell!
- No, no. - That's ridiculous,
that's actually ridiculous. - Oh no, no! - Oh no. - Oh, why he keeps coming back over here? - No! - Oh no. - You still in? - Yeah, absolutely, I'm
taking this other guy. - You're not taking , BradHeat. - That's him? - One of them. - What was that? - All right, all right, all right, let's see what we can do. Oh, we're done. - Yeah! - Dang it, how did he have full health? - Am I or am I just smart rat? What was that? - You just get the dough. - Oh, oh. - What was that? - No! - Get out of here. - Dang it. - GG, man. - I did not mean to do that, but I didn't mean to take the
dough from BradHeat over here. Get wrecked! - Next is everyone's
favorite game, "Minecraft". Rules are simple, last man standing wins. Five, four.
- Are we playing now? - Three.
- Okay, this is it. This is it right here.
- Two. One, go. - Am I beating him with my meat or not? What is this? - Whoever's sitting in this corner. - You're going down. No!
- No. - I mean it, no! - I can't, I couldn't leave. - Oh, you. Dang it! - Let's go! - Who won? Nice. - Get outta here. - Did you win? - Yeah.
- Yeah. - Die! - Yay! - Game number six is "Golf with Friends". - Here we go, baby. I need that first, I need that dough. - I'm gonna reel your dough. - Are you kidding me? - Oh, hole in one. Hole in one, baby, let's go! - It's all about intelligence! - You're kidding. Are you kidding me?
- Oh. - No! - What are these targets? What? - Yo, Chris just hit
this target and bounced. Are you kidding me? - Boom, baby. - No. - All right, watch it, Roger. Oh, Roger's gonna get through, oh. - Oh!
- You're blowing it, Roger. Blowing it! - Dude, I've been blowing this so hard. Oh, oh, okay. Oh, what? How is he already there? - I'm screwed, there's
no way I'm getting this. - I just threw, I just threw it, no! - Game number seven is literally the best game ever created, "MageQuit". - What the ! They're going after me. - Oh, oh God, no, no, no, no, no, no, don't touch me, don't
touch me, don't touch me. Oh God, why me? - Dude, there's so much going on. - Oh, you guys suck. Why is everyone going? No, are you kidding me? Everyone, oh my God. God, I can't. I wasn't even in view. - No!
- Boom. - Get Chris. - God, I can hit him.
- What? - Oh, oh.
- Got me, it's Chris. - Chris, oh you beat. - It's all good, okay.
- No! - What, what?
- Oh, you walked into a trap. - What, what? Oh, wait. That's a win, right? I mean, I survived the longest there. - What the . How do I, what? How do I get up? - Oh no, no, no, no! - Let's come down here and just chill. - Chris. - No, no, no, no, no. That's not what I wanted to do. - No, oh my God. Why is everybody targeting me?
- What? - Let's go. I'm setting down the log. You can't get through the log. Spells of weirdness.
- God. - No, are you kidding me? - Oh, look at Roger back
there, just camping. - Oh, leave me alone. No, oh no, he figured me out. Okay, I was third though. Wait, that's Dorian. - 6 1/2 hours later. - Come on, do something! - I'm sorry, this is for 30 rakorunis. - Oh no, he's dead, he's dead. - Oh no. - Good game! Let's go! - Game number eight is "GTA Racing". - Whoa! - Come on, let's go!
- Let's go! - Yeah. - This is for the marbles! - I got the boost! - Yeah, give me that boost. Let's go, no bump, no bump, no bump. Truce at the front. Hey, truce at the start,
truce at the start. - Yeah, okay, truce at the start. - Who says truce at the start? - Oh no, get outta here, every man for himself, come on. - Ooh, take a look. - Yeah, wow ! This is getting serious. - Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, easy with bumping. Easy with bumping. - I don't like being second. - Oh . - Chris is in first. We can't let it end that way. - No, no, no, no, I'm in fourth. If I get first, it's not- - He's not, he's at first. Don't listen to him. - He's not, here he is. - Don't do this, can't do this. - I don't know who that is. - No! Yeah, give me that boost, boys. I have LIGMA, don't
touch me, I have LIGMA. - I don't think that's
how it works, chief. - All right, truce. Me and Chris have a truce right now. - Will you chill out? Hey, hey, what are you doing? - I lied! - Dude, what the . We got seven laps, it's fine, it's fine. You can't get me!
- Yeah. - Truce, truce, truce, truce! Why? Why are you going after me? We're in seventh and last, bro. - Get away from me, stop, no. - Oh no, dang it. - No, no, why does that happen? My car is made of butter. - Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no! Oh no, no, no, no, no, no! - Yes! Yes! - No!
- Oh no, no, no, no, no, no! - What? Come on! - Did I get first? - Are you kidding me? - Oh. - Did I get first? Did I get first? - Yeah, it's one of those. I got fourth. - Game number nine is "Black Ops 4". - I am ready, I am really sweaty. Sorry, Ethan, you probably
won't hear much from me. - I just need to stay outta Chris's way. Ah, God, was that Chris? Oh, he's everywhere! - I've already conceded to the fact that I'm not gonna get first in this game. It's basically just like a countdown until Chris gets 30 kills. - Ah, my game's hanging. - All right, I'm gonna stay
away from that and that. That's for sure. Oh my God, that is definitely Chris. Oh God, how does he find me every time? - Yo, I cannot get this accuracy, dude. How do you people play on Xbox? - I mean, now just hold on a second. - Oh, I get, oh my God, dude. Of course! Oh my God, come on! - Like the accuracy is so . God, who plays on Xbox? - All right, we're not
last, we're not, oh. - Who's getting it last? - I'll take a second, I'll take a second. I'm not complaining. - So close, I was one kill off. That one hurts. - Get outta here, boys. 30 in three, boy. - And finally the last game is "Fortnite". They each play two games. The person with the most kills wins. - Yep, that guy. - Oh my gosh. Get him, get him. - Oh, oh. Too slow.
- Yeah. I think not. I think the keyboard and the mouse is better.
- All right. Oh, is that how we're doing?
- Yeah, we're doing two games. - Oh, two games, that's right, two games. - Oh my goodness. - Help him out, guys, come on. - Yeah, help him out. - Does anybody know how to play? - Play, that's it, that's it. - Die! - Die!
- Die! - Ah, come on. - Where is that? - Leave me alone, I have a strategy. - Oh yeah, oh yeah. - Hey, let's go. - Raven, oh, I saw a little bit of that. Oh God. He heard the shots, he
just built the mansion. - He's in blue, he's in blue. - I don't know how to use those balloons. - Right, you need to give him- - You wanna talk about it, bud? - Oh my God. - Whoa. - What? Oh God. - Oh, shoot, zombie. - Oh my God. - Oh, oh. - Oh! Dead. - That's one kill. - We got one. - Just like a million dollar action. - Oh, right, left, right there. Took down the office shield. - Oh!
- Oh! - Oh, that sucks. - Oh , I was about to
say, please come down. - Oh, extra, barely got your minimum. Oh, oh. - Oh!
- Oh! - Oh, not dead. - Go, go, go, go, go, go. - Oh. - So how many kills?
- Three, three kills? - Green screen. - Hey, put something dumb
on that green screen. - Oh, he got him down. - I think just hold it, hold
it, hold it, hold it, hold it. - Hey!
- Hey! - That guy was butt cheeks. - What's up to you? You heard someone busting? - Oh.
- Oh, oh! - Okay, I'm out, goodbye. - God, he's good. - Oh, oh. - Oh, it's not in those kits. - Oh my goodness. - Two kills. - Oh, there are two people right there with no weapons, come on! - Those are zombies. - Ah, man. - Ah, man. - Oh, oh, oh, oh. - Oh! They just can't be all that good, and I like that. - Oh, oh, oh, oh! - Oh! - Oh, he had a trap! Oh.
- Whoa! - Did you thank the bus driver? - Yeah.
- Yeah, okay. - Probably just spend
it on something else. - Oh, oh, oh, oh! - Thank you, guys. - He's gonna get killed, come on! - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! - Behind you, behind you. - Yeah!
- Oh, he got one. - He's doing okay. - Oh. - Okay, well, we're outta here, fam. - Well, I mean... - Jesus.
- Oh my God. - Dude, he wanted you so bad. I like playing as girls 'cause people are nicer to
you when you play as girls. - No, come on, turn around, idiot. - What the ? Hey!

go, I gotta go, I gotta." - Oh, oh! - Oh! - Oh God, you gotta get out of that. Oh no, you're not out of
it, you still have 41. - No! - He comes around the rock. - 30 grand on the line
for "Rock Paper Scissors". - Oh my God.
- So you both have 46 points. You have to "Rock Paper
Scissors", winner gets 30 grand, loser gets 20.
- All right, good luck. - 10 grand on the line for this game, "Rock Paper Scissors".
- Three best set of five. - I'll break his neck-
- All right, best set of five, yeah, best set of five. So this is essentially a $10,000 game. - Rock, paper, scissors, shoot. - Do the next one back to back. - Rock, paper, scissors, shoot. - Oh!
- Yeah! - Oh, yes! - Is that the anti-thought
reading devices? - All right, now that they can't read each other's thoughts, this should be a fair game. - Rock, paper, scissors, shoot. - Oh! - Yes, yes!
- Let's go! - Rock, paper, scissors, shoot. - Oh! Tyler got first place, 30 grand. Brad got second. Everyone else got 10. - Subscribe to Tyler Oliveira. YouTube channel will be in
the link and description. New bangers coming out daily, yes. - I like your face. - Thank you, God bless. Thank you for the 30 rakorunis. - Tyler, you got placed in first. - Indeed, I did. - Do you know where the money came from? It came from that sexy
hoodie you're wearing. - Wow!
- Ooh, ShopMrBeast? - And they should all
go to shopmrbeast.com so we can do something like this again. Brad, you know where your money came from? - Probably this sexy hoodie. - I know right, dude. People are buying them left and right. I can't keep 'em, you know, stocked. What about you, Rodge? - Dude, shopmrbeast.com. - Oh, you guys look so good in the hoodie. - Right, yeah.
- Yeah. - Yeah, Chris, would you say he looks really good in that hoodie? - Dashing. - Would you say these viewers will look in the hoodie? - They look good, but they look bad if they're not in it. - That's all I needed to hear. - All right guys, we're gonna call him to give him his 10 million underscore, underscore, underscore. Oh wow, you picked up quick. Hey, what's up, man? So as you know, you got first place, you killed the competition,
you won 30 grand, but while you were here, I completely forgot to give you your 10 million underscore,
underscore, underscore. I'm gonna share my screen real quick, and I'm gonna show you what we got you. And here you go. Here's your prize, your prize, right, get this, is 10 million Ws, 'cause you got the W. - There we go, okay. - Yep, see, well, look at all these Ws. Isn't it, here, like just to prove it, they are real Ws. As you see, there's 10 million. How does that make you feel? - I'm really excited
to copy and paste these and send them to BradHeat
if I get the opportunity. - No, no, no, see, so for
you guys that don't know, BradHeat got second place, so Brad actually gets 10 million Ls. You get the Ws 'cause you got the dough. I don't think I ever asked you, what are you gonna spend that 30 grand on? - I don't think I'll
spend the 30 rakorunis on anything too quickly. I think I'll invest the majority of it. And obviously, some of it will go to LIGMA research for my mom but in fact- - Thank you, you're a good
example for the youth. ♪ MrBeast ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ MrBeast ♪ ♪ Oh, MrBeast ♪ ♪ Oh ♪
