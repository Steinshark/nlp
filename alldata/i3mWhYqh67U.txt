when i started as a photographer i could travel for like three weeks at a time with carry-on bags only and that was including all my gearing clothes now i'm down here in the bowels of my building getting a folding cart out of storage just so that i can get through the airport on my own with all the checked bags how did this happen [Music] so i'm getting ready to head to mexico on a documentary expedition style shoot and i thought it'd be a perfect opportunity to make one of those packing videos and show you what i take with me on an average international job if you didn't already know i actually lived in mexico for four years so this is really exciting it's kind of like going back to my second home that i've been kept away from because of covid so i'm really looking forward to this one i'm a huge nerd for these sorts of packing videos and i know it's not super trendy to like gear but i can't help it it's just who i am i'm also gonna have to be a little bit vague on what i'm actually shooting because i don't know what i can and can't say from a legal point of view but i can say it's about rock climbing and it'll be in northern mexico and i'll be camping and not staying in a hotel for most of this shoot so the gear i'm bringing with me kind of reflects that situation i'm bringing a little bit less than i might to a shoot where you're staying in a hotel all the time and have constant access to electricity and vans at your disposal all day every day but for this we're going to be carrying a lot of stuff on our backs and we will be mostly living in tents it's a bit of a pair down version of what i might normally bring also i should mention that i'm definitely not the guy filming on the wall itself i'm a mediocre rock climber at the best of times so there's a specialist coming in to do that part of the job mainly i'll be focusing on the verite style documentary shooting before and after the climb sort of as they prep for the climb and you know the travel sequences and all that and after that once they actually start climbing i'll be doing a ton of drone flying and shooting with a super telephoto zoom from uh really far away i haven't actually done a lot of shooting like this so this is gonna be a new experience for me and i'm really looking forward to it again every shoot is different and i'm gonna take different stuff for different jobs depending on what the situation needs but i'd say this is a pretty good representation of what i might take on an average shoot also a lot of the specialty items are coming with other crew from the u.s it's a lot harder and quite a bit more expensive to get stuff here in canada so things like the drones and the super telephoto lenses are gonna come from american crew members and i'll get them from them there all right so before my girlfriend totally loses patience with me for destroying our living room to get this shot let's get into it so for this shoot i have four checked bags plus a rolling cart and then two carry-ons which is actually pretty good for me so let's start with the carry-ons first okay so this is like an old manfrotto bag i bought it years ago and it's not amazing but it definitely works i normally use this uh just to get the gear in and out of the airport like i'll pack everything into it and then once i land i'll build the camera and then this will kind of get left in the hotel room for the rest of the shoot so inside here normally the cameras would be right here i put the main camera here and then my b camera which right now is the fx3 right here but obviously they're shooting this video so it's empty beyond that i've got six seven v-mount batteries two of these fs7 batteries that also have dtap super important that my batteries have dtap ports on them because they allow that allows you to run a monitor and any other accessories that you might have if you just get the normal sony batteries you can't power an external monitor and you're kind of stuck with that little tiny viewfinder that comes with the camera and that's just no good especially at 4k focus is so critical so you need to have some sort of monitor also i have xqd cards for the fs7 here i've got sd cards fast ones for the fx3 smaller ones for the drone always useful here i've got a rode video micro i use this on the fx3 for sort of vlog style content i wouldn't really use this to actually film with but for what it is it's a great little mic and i love it also i have if you can't tell i'm a huge nerd for pouches and here i've got just general cables and power stuff so on this side i've got a bunch of different cables micro usb usb c to usba usbc usbc iphone cables charger for my macbook and card readers for both cameras [Music] that's everything in here so when you're flying the rule of thumb is always make sure that you carry on the bare minimum that you need to actually make the camera work it's okay to like check the follow focus and the you know the novelty lenses and the accessories that aren't crucial for filming but you want to make sure that in a worst case scenario like the airline loses all your bags you still have everything you need to set up the camera and get them running it won't be ideal but at least you can work it's okay to check things like your follow focus and your you know your extra grip kit and the novelty lenses but you want to make sure that at a bare minimum you can get the camera up and running so you can start filming in a worst case scenario so like if the airline loses all your bags you can still film it might not be as good you might be upset to not have everything that you want with you but at least you can shoot until you're able to find a solution next is my second carry-on this is an f-stop icu they're called this actually will go into a much bigger backpack but the backpack's so big it doesn't really fit into an overhead bin or at least the flight attendants can tend to give you a lot of a lot of pushback on it so i just take it out and carry it with me and then when i get there i'll unpack it put it inside the backpack and i'll be good to go so this is mostly lenses um i've got the second half of my fuji mk cinema lens set this is the 50 to 135 and then filming on my a cam right now is the 18 to uh 18 to 55. they're great lenses they're super lightweight they're just a joy to use they're expensive but for what they are not that expensive you know to get big cinema zooms can be five or six times more so it's actually a pretty good deal these things i've absolutely loved them and i filmed almost everything that i've shot for the last two years on these things uh most of the time so can't recommend these enough [Music] uh here is a shotgun mic it's not road it's a road tube these are great for transport this is a sennheiser mk416 pretty decent shotgun here i've got a basic 70-200 f4 i just like this because it's super lightweight doesn't take up a lot of room and it's reasonably sharp i know the 2 8 version is you know a little bit nicer but it's way heavier and way bigger and i actually don't use zoom lenses that much for me it's kind of a specialty thing so this works more than more than well enough for what i needed to do the other cameraman is also bringing a 200 to 600 mil lens so that's going to be what i'm on most of the time when i'm shooting the climbers from far away i also have a 1.4 times extender um for the 70-200 gives a little bit of extra reach there's also a doubler but in my experience the doubler kind of degrades the image a fair bit so the 1.4 for me is a good balance of extra reach but also keeping the image quality here i've got the extra monitor for the fs7 i really never use it but it's an emergency thing sometimes the sdi or hdmi out settings get changed and suddenly your external monitors don't work anymore so this is a good backup just in case also here i have a sigma art 35 prime and another sigma art 85 prime this is one of the new ones that's a little bit lighter and has the built-in aperture ring i hope that sigma's in the process of re-releasing all their art lenses with this aperture ring because it is awesome these lenses are optically fantastic but they're kind of heavy and they're mainly stills lenses so to have them re-housed with manual click-less aperture rings and a lighter weight i love them i'd get the whole set i've also got some of these double-a rechargeable batteries no i usually use these for my uh wireless lav mics i know a lot of sound guys will say don't use rechargeable batteries because they don't accurately show you how much power is left but i can easily get through a day on a set of these batteries it's never really been a problem so i prefer not to generate a bunch of extra waste and garbage so for me it's worth the trade off to use rechargeables otherwise you just end up throwing out dozens and dozens of you know disposable batteries at the end of every shoot and it just doesn't make me feel very good [Music] lastly i have the canon 100 millimeter macro this is a bit of a specialty lens but i actually use it quite a lot when you can get macro shots it's kind of an unusual perspective and can really up your production value so i try to bring it with me it's not super big not really heavy and doesn't take up a lot of room so that's everything for the carry-on bags uh between that and the backpack it's everything i need to make the camera actually run and so in a worst case scenario if i lose everything else at least i have a working camera okay next i have this guy this is a think tank airport security i think it's called it's not the smallest one and it's not the biggest one either um i use this thing for all the camera peripherals the things that aren't 100 essential to making the camera run but uh make it much much easier so in here i have tons of pouches you can definitely see that i love pouches i am a giant pouch nerd and whenever i come across one i always keep it and i will usually find a home for it to start with these are monitor accessories so i use a small hd 502 which is on the camera right now that usually goes in here uh there's hdmi extra sdi cables um and here i have my monitor arms um these ones are made by wooden camera but i think they ripped off the design from a company called ultralight compact systems or something like that it's just basically a modular arm based around these ball and socket pieces you can get all sorts of attachments like quarter 20 threads clamps you get extenders to make it longer you can get hot shoe cold shoe mounts um i've got ones with nato rails on the camera itself right now there's a whole bunch of different attachments you can get and these are really really useful they're not super cheap but you can use them in a ton of ways not just for mounting monitors but also for clamping things to light stands holding up small lights you can do a ton of stuff with these i use them all the time and even though they're a little bit overpriced i would probably buy them again if they were available in canada i'd probably get the ultralight compact systems the original company i forget exactly what they're called but i'll link below in the in the description the wooden camera ones are decent but they're not quite as good i think they probably have to change the design to get around the copyright owned by the other company so they work but the original ones are better also i've got a couple of tools allen keys small screws things that help get the monitor on the mount if i need them more sdi cables you can never have too many if those things fail it's a giant mess [Music] then i have just a hardware pouch inside here i've got tons of stuff screwdriver lots of different shapes of 15 millimeter rails all different sizes a kong clip for my easy rig more allen keys tiny little screwdrivers nato rail more little screwdrivers clip for a shotgun mic to attach it to rails so in here are all the things i use to kind of build up the rig itself i've got different sized rails depending on how i'm rigging the camera and then the tools to connect it all this is the power cables and charging accessories for my ice light which is a super versatile sort of two foot long tube light made by westcott so all that stuff stays together and here is where i keep my lav mics clip to the outside i've got a set of headphones which are super important especially if you're doing documentary verite you always want to be able to hear what the characters are saying so that you know what to film if you don't listen to their audio you can miss little nuances like for example i was filming in the cave in kenya and the scientists i was with got lost and started to panic he was whispering to himself don't panic don't panic don't panic over and over if i hadn't been able to listen to what he was saying into his lav mic i would have never known what was happening and i wouldn't have known how to film the situation properly in terms of lav mics i just use these very basic sennheiser g3s i've had these things for almost 10 years now they just are bulletproof they never break um they're fantastic i asked a professional audio guy buddy of mine if i could switch to something like i wanted to have an amazing audio system and so i was asking about electrosonics and all these more expensive brands and he basically told me just to keep using these so maybe if they break i'll upgrade to something else but they've done me really well for most of my career the only thing i would say is to change the microphone um i use this guy this is a sanken cos11 um this thing is much smaller than what comes with the sennheisers it's not that much cheaper than the lav pack itself so it's a decent investment but a good lav mic will really improve your audio and it'll make it much easier to hide the mic under a t-shirt so highly recommended also in here are these rye coat undercovers these stickies basically like little felt pieces that you connect to these stickered backs you remove the one side stick it on the mic and then on the other side you stick it to the inside of their t-shirt so it's a great way to hide mics then there's these thicker dead cat windjammer versions that you can use if you're going to be working outside in really high winds these things are so much better than just a piece of gaff tape under someone's t-shirt they're way easier to hide and they're just a really simple solution for how to get a good lav mic on someone when you don't have a professional sound guy with you to do it for you back here our xlr cable little shotgun mount so i can screw it on to a light stand or a gorillapod or something like that extra batteries just in case [Music] here i have a hood sun hood for my small hd monitor in here this is my bright tangerine [Music] follow focus this thing is definitely over engineered it's super solid [Music] yeah um just feels like it's bomb proof it's solid metal which is great for durability but it's actually one thing that i um don't like that much about it it's really heavy for what it is um i used a cheaper follow focus in the past and it just kind of didn't work very well it drove me crazy it kept skipping the gears this thing is much better but it's probably unnecessarily heavy for a shoulder mounted camera i'm definitely going to keep using it because it's so well designed but it does add a lot of extra weight it'd be no problem if you were mostly on a tripod or something like that but when it's on your shoulder all day this thing is heavy so i just take it apart for travel and keep it inside this this little different pouch here i've got the pieces of the shoulder rig itself so the camera mounts to here it's got a vct wedge for locking onto my tripod uh this texturized rubber part that fits to your shoulder nicely um points for 15 inch 15 mil rails come out the front and the back um i use v-mount batteries and not the stock ones so here's my battery plate that'll sit on rails and from the front here i'll attach the follow focus and like a monitor uh lens support arm if i need it if it's super heavy we've got this shape arm these things are great um they're a little expensive but for what they do they're fantastic so i attach this to this and then the whole thing sits on my shoulder like this the nice thing about them is when they're attached you can adjust them super easily so when you've got this thing on your shoulder it's really easy to move into different configurations you don't have to unscrew anything or you know untighten um a nut or or something it makes it really easy to do quick changes on the fly so a little overpriced but really well engineered and once you have it you'll use it all the time and be glad you've got it then this is a wooden camera top handle i attach this to a natal nato rail on the top of my fs7 and just going to be a nice solid way to carry it plus i can put my gratical eye and my monitor arm in here just like that [Music] here i have a aputure mc light these things are really useful tiny little led light i use this thing mostly for effects purposes it's not like necessarily the best light on its own but the pre-programmed effects like the fire and the lightning and the paparazzi and stuff are really useful to augment a scene so like if we're doing a fireside conversation i'll often stick these on a gorillapod turn it on to the fire effects and just use it to add a bit of fill light that looks really natural another mic this is a mk sennheiser mk600 it's a lot smaller not quite as good as the 416 but it's tiny and lightweight so i'll use this one weights an issue a couple of filters here i've got a variable nd quarter pro mist this step up ring so a nice tip is to buy your filters in the largest size lens that you have so my bigger lenses are 82 mil and instead of buying different filters for all your lenses just use a step up ring on the smaller lenses and that way you only need one of each kind of filter then i've got here this topo designs pouch one of my favorite pouches this has this aladdin a light this thing is fantastic it's a bi-color really powerful battery-powered led i like it because you can change the batteries so many so many products are going to built-in internal batteries and they just kind of wear out and when they're done you can't use it anymore so to have interchangeable batteries is really helpful plus it's super well made it's solid metal it's really bright and the colors look amazing so i use this all the time also i have the little brother this is the aladdin highlight this thing is really cool i don't use it for everything but it's so small that you can hide in places so like on a car dashboard you can tape it to a wall next to someone when you're doing an interview um you can use and it's really bright for what it is i mean you can use this out of battery of course it's really bright for what it is you can use this in a lot of different places when a normal light would be hard to fit in so aladdin is a cool south korean company their stuff is pretty expensive i mean this is like four times or five times more than than the aputure mc but the build quality and the brightness and stuff for me make it worthwhile um it's one of those things that you don't want to pay for but once you have it'll last a really long time and you'll be glad you have it in here i have the dual charger for my v-mount batteries nothing fancy there just a quick charger i like this one because it has this slow charge uh mode so when time isn't super critical you can charge the batteries more slowly and it extends their life so that's kind of cool and that's it i think oh in the lid here i have just a couple little accessories like uh this is the power supply to go from the d-tap of my v-mount to the 12-volt on on the back of the camera what else xlr extra xlr cables for uh connecting the shotgun mic an extra card reader for the iphone 7 and some extra sdi cables oh i also have this little two terabyte uh ssd drive by samsung these things are great because they're tiny um we're gonna have a lot of big heavy-duty hard drives to back up the main footage of the show but i'm also shooting youtube content as we go and if i get any really great shots i want to keep them for my reel so i always keep this with me on every shoot in case i want to dump some of the footage onto my own hard drive before i leave my bag fetish might seem out of control and to be honest it kind of is like i love camera bags i don't know if anybody else is the same way as me but a really well made camera bag to me is totally worth the money i mean this thing is made by think tank um it is crazy expensive i think it was like a 500 suitcase which is insane but it works so well it just takes every bit of abuse that i throw at it and it just keeps working perfectly you know it's small touches that make it worthwhile for me like the fact that i've got a built-in lock built-in lock here um you know the quality of the wheels the quality of the handle it just feels like it can do anything i ask of it um so for me investing in really good bags especially when you travel all the time like i do is totally worth it [Music] now we get into the pelican cases everyone's favorite uh film production box these things are great they're awesome for keeping your gear safe in transit but once you get on the ground they're a little annoying to move around especially if you're doing docks where you're constantly changing environments so i tend to pack stuff in them that can stay in the vehicle for the most part so on this one i have on this one i have a bunch of more pouches um obviously i love pouches so i have this belt and then all of these pouches attach onto this belt so so it can be a really great way if you need to mix and match things that you got to carry like here i can take a big telephoto lens and a short zoom and wrap it around my waist on this belt also if you just wanted to throw a lens inside a backpack and keep it safe yeah these things are really really useful then i've got my ac sort of tool kit this thing um i think every dp should have a basic tool kit i've had this since i used to be an ac myself before i was actually a dp um i'll make a separate video sometime on how to build out one of these things for yourself but in here i keep things like a rocket blower cleaning solution sharpies really good set of allen keys in here i've got a leatherman wave this thing is a fantastic multi-tool and here i've got a bunch of uh screwdriver attachments for it so i can do a lot with just this one multi-tool what else do i have some mole skin for um putting padding on lav mics and also doubles uh for your feet if they get destroyed on a shoot helps prevent blisters uh paintbrush super useful for brushing dust off your camera lens cloth these things lens tissues these are really useful for cleaning off your lens they're sort of lint free paper if you can find it cheaper it's the same as the paper that women use for their face i think it's called like facial makeup tissue or grease paper or something like that so if you can find it cheaper you might be able to find it cheaper in the cosmetics section of a pharmacy rather than a video supply store and in here just a bunch of bongo ties if you don't know what bongo ties are these little elastics with this bongo shaped piece of wood on them so they're really handy for attaching things and get a really tight grip on things i'll make maybe a separate video just on the various uses of bongo ties seriously do yourself a favor buy a couple packs of these you will use them all the time and i've got this bag this is a waste bag made by mountain smith um this is where i'll keep all my personal stuff on a shoot so i'll put a little raincoat in here i'll carry my water in here any snacks i might need sunglasses sunscreen stuff like that this is so this is what i carry around with all the stuff that's not for shooting but for me some people use a backpack but i have this and it works really well [Music] a bunch of different kinds of tape gaff tape [Music] daft tape which everybody loves but gaff tape will destroy walls and leave residue on things sometimes you need paper tape as well paper tape is a lot less strong but it won't leave any residue on things so for example when i finish shooting off a memory card i want to make sure that it's not going to get used again by mistake so i'll put a piece of tape over it to let myself know that it's full but if you use gaff tape and it gets really hot the tape can actually melt onto the memory card and possibly damage it so paper tape is really useful there also for taping onto people's walls you can destroy someone's paint um if you put too much gaff tape on so paper tape is useful good to have both a bunch of paracord stuff's always useful just picked it up so this thing is great this is a portable stool uh it's a little funny and you know you can make fun of me if you want but when you're in the middle of nowhere and you're trying to do a sit-down interview it can be really hard to find something for someone to sit on so busting this out at the right time can win you huge brownie points with a director and also when you're in the camping situation like i am it gives you something to sit on so it's not super big doesn't weigh very much um really useful we've got just a basic extension cord this bag this is where i keep grip equipment um i've got a pretty paired down grip set up here uh normally i'd have some bigger more heavy duty stuff but we're really trying to save weight so i'm bringing these matthews mini uh mini grip kit i think it's called it's basically smaller lighter plastic versions of normal c-stand or grip heads [Music] they're really strong they're surprisingly strong and they work pretty much the same way as a normal grip head but just a fraction of the weight so i've got i think i don't know three or four of these plus clamps and with this stuff you can do a lot of mounting i also have these really lightweight rods that you can feed into them which give them just a little bit more reach and functionality so not a lot of grip equipment but we shouldn't need much of it on this shoe [Music] also a couple of heavy-duty clamps always useful in the lid here we've got mini clamps [Music] i've got shower curtain uh super cheap just bought off amazon but you know can really help um tape this thing over a window while you're doing an interview to soften things up or uh just use it for general diffusion and you don't care what happens to it so uh for like five ten bucks or something it's worth bringing this is the mystery pablo pablo is uh the dp who kind of taught me how to shoot documentaries um one of my main mentors definitely my main mentor on video so i named this this pouch after him this ducey means pouch in spanish this just has some random stuff like these tie downs velcro straps um more bungee straps power converters uh to toupee tape for mounting like for taping microphones to people's chest more bongo ties just a bunch of little fun things that you can use in an emergency to kind of hold things together i think that's it use the forms that say someone dug through this before in customs okay now we're getting into my two least favorite bags this huge duffel uh basically is only for the airport it's where i carry all the long items so in here i have my tripod bag obviously the tripod is here filming that's where it would normally go inside i also have one of these uh small peak design travel tripods this thing's really great it's expensive but uh it's super handy if you need two cameras for an interview or time lapses or something like that i'll stick my mirrorless camera my fx3 on here um and it's great doesn't take up a lot of space i think totally worth it i also have uh an ice light westcott ice light it's basically just a long light tube uh there's like lots of much cheaper chinese knockoff versions of these things which i'm sure work great as well but this thing's incredibly strong can take a beating has interchangeable batteries and it's just always worked really well for me so definitely recommend it also in here i have this is my main shooting backpack this is a f-stop tilopa i always want to call it tilopia or tilapia like the fish i think it's tilopa i guess i should give a disclaimer f-stop gave me this bag i didn't pay for it but i would have bought it anyways it's a great piece of gear it's bomb proof and i'll just drop that whole icu unit that i use as a carry-on that just drops in the top and all your gear is accessible from the back so this is just like a really heavy-duty hiking bag you can carry an incredible amount of gear on you and it'll keep it pretty safe love this better a couple of light stands i use these matthews folding stands um i think they're just a really good mix of strength and space so they hold like 12 pounds you can put like a proper light on them but they also pack up pretty small and then also in here i have matthews road rags these things are basically a traveling flag set so you have these sort of tentpole like things that fold out into a big u and then you have a couple different things you've got diffusion flags scrims so half and full stop scrim and and a flag so like a duvetyne solid piece of black that you can use to cut light so they don't take up a lot of space and you can get i think they're three foot by two foot so pretty big um when you're traveling you need to keep space down and you can't bring like big pieces diffusion and frames with you uh this is a nice option and then lastly we have this big old boy this is not a camera bag at all this is uh just a random rolling suitcase that i bought on sale [Music] um this is like i said an expedition style job so here i've got my tent a bunch of camping gear so sleeping bag therm-a-rest stuff like that [Music] flip-flops for camp gorillapod super useful for time lapses and maybe even some vlogging maybe i'll have time for that basic first aid cooking camping stove with some instant coffee inside a tarp for camp athletic greens these things are great when you're traveling and you don't really know if you're gonna be getting all your nutrients and stuff in these are kind of like a basic stop gap to keep you from getting sick headlamp thermos super important nalgene uh and then in the bottom here i have a [Music] f-stop guru it's like a small 25 liter version of their bigger hiking packs and i usually keep that for giving to an ac or something full of lenses it's just a nice small bag that can hold a lot of stuff don't know if i'll use it but i've got the space i might as well bring it okay so that's pretty much everything i'm bringing on the shoot i do have one more bag but that's full of clothes so um nothing exciting in there uh the next step in the process is to get all of this stuff onto the folding cart but first just give me a minute to tear down all this gear and then i'll show you how that works hey guys once i laid this video out on a timeline i realized that it ballooned to this like crazy ridiculous length if anyone made it to the end of this you're a legend and you must love packing videos as much as i do but i'm guessing that for normal people this is just way too long thanks for bearing with me while i figure out this youtube thing and i promise that the next time i try one of these i'll keep it to a more reasonable time limit [Music] so all right so there it is that's how you get to an airport by yourself with six checked bags and two carry-ons probably the least sexy piece of gear you'll ever buy i mean who wants to buy a cart when you could be saving up for a lens or a camera body or something but when you need to move 500 pounds worth of gear on your own through an airport you're gonna be really happy you have this thing it's super nerdy i know but i love it so much and i use it all the time might seem like a crazy amount of gear but it's actually a pretty light pack for me the other dp who's meeting me down there is bringing at least double the amount of stuff and i'm leaving about four bags at home that i would bring on most other shoots we're not using any lights for this shoot and i'm leaving all the luxury items like an easy rig behind but these things can easily spiral out of control and be much much bigger than this i've been on shoots before where there were like 50 pelican cases to check uh so this isn't really that bad now that the cart's all loaded and ready to go the only thing left is to get up at 4am tomorrow and go to the airport which is probably one of my least favorite parts about this job i'm hoping to shoot a bunch of behind the scenes content from mexico but this is going to be the first time that i'm trying to shoot for youtube at the same time as i'm doing a paid professional job so i'm just going to have to wait and see what i can come up with hopefully something good as always if there's anything you want to know more about or if you have any ideas on how i can make these videos better let me know in the comments down below see ya you
