Today is about Europe's long-lost medieval number system. [Renaissance Music] So, for the first thousand years, the first millennium, there was one game in town and that was Roman numerals. Everyone knows what roman numerals are: one, two, three, four, five etc. Then from the 13th century, thereabouts, there was a new guy in town and that was Arabic numerals. Which as we know: zero, one, two, three, four, five; and for the next hundred years, there was a couple of centuries actually, there's a kind of battle between who's gonna win. Which is gonna be the dominant number system and, as we know, the one that won; the notation that we use all over the world is the Arabic number system. It's like much much better, it's kind of place value, it's got the zero - et cetera. What almost no one knows is that in the late middle ages, so between the 13th and the 15th century, there was a third guy in town. This was the notation that was devised and developed and used by the Cistercian order. So this is a group of monks, it's actually the most influential religious order of the late middle ages. They're actually an offshoot, you know if you wanted a bit of ecclesiastical history; they're an offshoot of the Benedictines who didn't think the Benedictines were ascetic enough. It has a kind of minimalist lifestyle where it's just you and like the Earth. So what the Cistercians did is that they were really into sort of manual labour, and as a result of that they actually developed lots of techniques and agriculture and architecture. And they built up from, beginning in the 11th century, two three centuries later they had about more than 500 monasteries all across Europe; from the north of the British isles down to the Mediterranean. From Poland 
on one side to Portugal the other. And they used, amongst themselves, a secret number notation. And I want to show it to you. It is like magical looking; it's kind of
mysterious also. Here it is. So I'm going to write down four numbers in Cistercian notation. [Music] (Brady: It's like you're playing hangman)
- It is! [Music] So these are four numbers; what can you make out of that? And in fact this is a puzzle, I call it- it's a monkey puzzle. I love that pun, I hope you did as much. It's a monkey puzzle, um, in my new puzzle book about languages; and- because this is a kind of scientific language-
- (Brady: what you mean that-) (you mean that book there?)
- That one there. Very good, especially for Christmas gifts and during lockdown for spending all your evening doing all these wonderful language and number puzzles. (Brady: But you didn't make this up,
this is like) This is totally true, this is totally true. Umm, there- in fact no one really knows about it until about 20 years ago, a historian of science called David A King wrote a book about it; because he had realised and discovered; he did his sort of kind of life's research on this number system. And the book is accepted as true and you can see these in some of the ancient texts. And this kind of secret number system, obviously it didn't catch on, but it was used by various different groups for kind of medieval ciphers and secret number systems. So it was used even once the Cistercians stopped using it. Anyway can I tell you something more about the Cistercians? The 
Cistercians were brilliant. So they wanted a very ascetic type of life and so they banned speaking, okay? So about a thousand years ago they- a vow of silence, you weren't allowed to speak; so they developed their own sign language. So one of the first people to develop their own sign language and they used this sign language for a thousand years. And I called up the British Cistercian abbey, there's only one left in in England, and says 'do you still use this
vow of silence sign language?' and they said [Silence] '...no we don't but some of our elder monks still understand it'. And it's so great because what they do is that they get these words and they have to piece the meaning of the words into smaller bits. So, for example - and also each bit is a kind of mime of what the word represents. So what do you think this might mean? And don't be rude
- (Brady: Hole?)
- Milk! This is milk, it's milking the udder! Okay, this is brown so- it's chocolate milk. Okay another one. this-
- (Brady: Hang on, why was that brown?) I don't know why that is brown. 
- (Okay) There's a great book there's written in the 70s where um a researcher went into one of these abbeys where they were still speaking it and took loads of pictures and wrote it all down; in fact there's a great puzzle about this in my language book. Anyway so I know all about the Cistercians, they're absolutely fascinating. Another one just very quickly; this means land, or country - what country is this? (Brady: Drink-tea-land - England!)
- Yes! Isn't that brilliant? Okay another one, are you liking this so much? What is this? (Finger, ring?) (Knuckle?)
- E!
- (Oh E) E-tall-E-land. (Tall land...)
- Italy!
- (That's harder!) Okay let's get back to here. So it is true, it does look a bit like hangman; or it looks a little bit like stick men, could put a little sort of head there. I'm going to give you more of a clue now, I'm going to say what the numbers are. This is actually 1410, this one is 4173, this one is 5750, and this one is 1368. Now do you have any more of a clue about how this might work? (Brady: Uh, I mean obviously 
where things come) (off the main) (stem is important-)
- Yeah very good, very good. You might want to freeze it now and people can have a think, because I'm about to give the game away. (Okay, little bit of elevator music!) [Renaissance Music] Here - this is 1410, I'm going to tell you already that it's expressed as a decimal, 
so the system is decimal. We've got two 1s here, and these two bits look quite the same. And we've got two 5s here and these two bits look the same. So actually that's something - like that is gonna be like a 5, that's gonna be a 1; and also if that's like a 1 we've got 1 going out there. So but you're beginning to piece together this idea that these elements that are coming off, rather than the sides, the ends are the digits expressed in some way. It is a system that can only write every number from zero to 9999. It can't do any other numbers. So this, in fact, is how you count. Zero is just the stem. So every number has a stem. That is 1, this is 2, this is 3, this is 4. Now we get fun - so that's a 4,
so I can say 0, 1, 2, 3 4. This is 4. 5 is 4 and 1 so put the 4 and 1 together, that's 5; this is 6. To get to 7, which is 6 and 1, is that. 8, which is 6 and 2, and 9 which is 6 and 3, is that. That is 0 to 9, but what you see is that if you divide it into four quarters: the units go here, this is tens, this is hundreds, and this is thousands. So that is a one thousand, that's a 400. Then we get this one here and 0. So, Brady: choose any four digit number and let's write the number. Day you were born or-
- (Brady: 6666.) 6666? Well that's gonna be easy. So you go to 6, 666 - it's going gonna be 6, 6, 6, 6. It looks quite good, It looks like a um, a quad bike seen from above.
- (Brady: Nice, okay I'll give you that.) Or how about 2020? 2020 would be 2, so it's that, then 0 and then 2, and then there's that. But how about say 1969? That's the 
year I was born. (Brady: Best year of your life!)
- Best years. Okay so 19, so it would be a 1 here, then there'll be a 9 and then there'll be a 6, and then a 9.
- (Nice!) It's quite fun isn't it? (It wouldn't be very useful for things) (like mathematics. Like if I said add) (3472 to whatever, like, wouldn't be a
good way.) No, but what would be really cool, and really easy; and where it was used by the Cistercians is for dates; because dates have four digits. So it's like brilliant - in fact for my puzzle book, where I put this in, I wanted the publisher to actually put the date in the opening page written in Cistercian notation but I was told they weren't allowed to. But another thing where it is good 
and it is often used - or was used by
the Cistercians; was for page numbers of books. Roman numerals are still used, widely in modern culture, but they're only used at times when you use numbers not for mathematics. So dates, page numbers, chapter numbers; super bowls - things like that. So you could quite easily do the super bowl in um Cistercian numbers. Maybe you could do some - I don't know is there 
any kind of the Catholic olympic games or something? They could use that. (Brady: Yeah, that's a cool system.)
- Isn't it really cool? [Laughter] This is house or room and... ...is toilet because it's the shame house. A barn is cow-house. (Brady: Shame-house?)
- Shame-house, yeah. (Imagine going, excuse me can I ask 
where the shame-house is?)
