all right are you ready two regrets of a 55 year old retired software engineer he worked for a Fortune 500 company and wish somebody had told him this earlier uh this is pretty much most my life as always this which is just I wish I would have known something earlier is this is this photo chat Jeopardy oh no it's it's apparently it's real I just assume everything I see is chat Jeopardy I have started thinking about my long-term plan and what I want to do in my life soon I will share those with you but as part of the plan I decided to make a plan to talk with different kinds of programmers my main goal is to learn as much as possible from then I also decided to write fundamentally and unique content for my followers and readers on medium so that they can also get benefited from my initiative all right the build up for play over let's go this week I talked with a 55 year old retired software developer who started his career when he was 35 oh unusually late start right is that a late start or is that is that normal these days I guess 20 years ago that would be if they're 55 today that means they started 20 years ago that would be kind of unusual right today I don't think it's very unusual I think there's a lot of I think there's a lot of people coming in uh much later in life than you know the norm was 20 years ago you started at 29 yeah I guess my professionally I started when I was 25. all right I started uh professionally at 36 yeah I think today it I think in the last 10 years this number has greatly changed yeah I think you start wow a lot of people started in their 30s that's awesome to see by the way I started at 14 professionally damn you're one of other one other person I know a friend of mine named Brent also started in his teens crazy crazy all right anyways uh the plan was he would give me 30 minutes but when we finished our conversation it was more like an hour and a half I enjoyed our session he said he might feel uncomfortable if anyone he knows reads this article yeah that's how it always goes so I am not disclosing his name but for the sake of this article let's call him Mr Berry who buried these nuts uh one of my questions was if he had any regrets about his light or his long job Life as a software developer he gave an excellent long answer I am summarizing it to the two main points and here are those okay so I'm actually pretty excited about this you should always try to listen to people that have been where you're walking do you know what I mean if you're going somewhere and someone has already walked it listen because even if their advice is bad there's probably a couple good tips in there right I always say the phrase eat the fish spit the bones you know what I mean eat the fish spit the bones how do you know it wasn't just AI we're about to find pressure this is the most important lesson for me he told me he had two friends John and Romeo of course fake names working in the same company the company was making a SAS software the product was new and all the employees had to take extra pressure because they wanted to launch it before Christmas and the time was insufficient so they had to do overtime but my first honestly my first real job as I like to refer to it I did a lot of overtime uh now the main part let's see now the main part Romy used to take more pressure than John Romy used to do overtime if necessary but Jon never did extra work interesting I wonder where this is going to go now when the management needed to do extra work they asked Romy to do it uh to do so because they knew John would never respond to this type of request and they could uh couldn't rely on Sean these incidents happened to him too he couldn't say no to them so he so he told me the more pressure you take the more pressure you will get by that I can I can most certainly buy this uh uh this is true from everything I've seen too right uh I also experienced the same thing but then I asked if developers don't take pressure wouldn't they get fired he replied that's true but in his experience those who can say no to extra pressure win in the long run I asked how he replied he saw around 10 to 20 percent of these people get fired they managed to land another job within two to three months sometimes with a better salary and most of these developers don't get fired because they leave the toxic environment before the toxic environment fires them hmm interesting perspective so I I guess I kind of I guess I kind of land somewhere in the middle right like if if there's a big thing that's happening at my job so Netflix has been typically by the way I work on Netflix by the way uh you know by the way uh it's typically been a really great job thus far uh I really have had very few uh pressure points I've had very few times in which I have to like do stuff and so when it comes time to it and your job doesn't do this all the time there's very rare crunch I feel like I will do crunch you know I mean like if I have to if it's time to kick some ass and take some names if I needed to do that if my boss said hey I need you to just like work as hard as you can and get this thing done as fast as possible I would do that right uh just because they've invested so long and they haven't demanded it regularly of me so I think there's definitely there's definitely some wisdom in here that is kind of missing which is it depends on the situation I will go out of my way to keep my employer happy because they've gone out of their way to keep me happy as well now if that relationship isn't you know if it if it's not going back and forth then yeah it's a bad environment yeah there's layers to pressure there's always layers to pressure and so I would definitely not go one way or the other but that one job that I had that I had it all the time I look back on that and also think hey that was the time that I became the developer of who I am today is because of the pressure so I I just never know how to take this one which I think you gotta learn how to set boundaries but at the same time it can make you into a great developer going through some seasons of pressure so I just don't know I honestly I never know which way to fall on this one I never know because I don't think there's a cut and dry answer I think some people will tell you always go for it I think some people will tell you don't ever do it and then there's just some middle ground that exists where it's like sometimes you should do it sometimes you shouldn't do it and if it's a toxic environment the problem is the word toxic gets just so overused in our society or at least in the west that I don't even know what when someone uses the term toxic I don't know what it even means do you know what I mean like it doesn't mean something concrete anymore in my head and so it's very difficult for me to like know what it means when they say toxic does that mean there's seasons of crunch does it mean that the managers pressure you in a pretty poor way to do things it doesn't mean that the management doesn't do anything but tells you to do everything like what does it mean like well what are you trying to say uh boss asks you to do work uh see that's the problem is it depends on who you ask what toxic means so I like I like to use more crisp definitions of things but I like this point overall if you are working in a place that is just just crunch consider somewhere different right learn to say no uh and even if you're working in a place that isn't crunch learn to say no it's very important not taking enough risks have you ever seen Let's See How I Met Your Mother no I haven't this is one of my favorite TV shows of all time I have probably seen it more than 10 times yeah I'm a freak of this show and season one episode episode 21 Lily quoted an emotional dialogue when she was leaving her fiance for her lifelong dream to become an artist there are certain things in life you where you know it's a mistake but you don't really know it's a mistake because the only way to know that it really is a mistake is to make that mistake and go yep that was my mistake so really the bigger mistake would be to not make the mistake because then you'll go about your whole life not knowing whether it was a mistake or not I don't necessarily think this was this is great advice right here uh just so you know how I met your mother is not necessarily great advice um I love this probably not that um why am I let's talk about the scene when Mr Berry was talking about his career in his life I could only think and feel this scene after 10 to 12 years of working as a developer he got an offer to work at a startup with the same salary he was getting in his job but he was a senior developer and the company had stock options he thought working in a startup was risky because it could all fail he was right working the startup is always risky but after three years the startup was valued at over 100 million he regrets uh it's till this date because it was a 50 50 decision and at the last minute he rejected the offer he wished that he had more courage and took the risk yeah I mean Heinz you know hindsight's always 20 20. you know if the situation was reversed he would have been like wow so glad I did that uh you should always take risk uh and what I mean by that is that it's calculated risk right and so when I was younger I was about a year and a half into my career and a guy named Jeff gave me a call and said hey I saw you've been using rxjs and I'd like to talk to you about using rxjs at the startup and I said okay well since it's a personalized message I I will be glad to talk to you so we got on the phone we talked for a long time and then he offered me a job and I said yes and that's how I started working at Netflix now the thing about this job was that my wife was 36 weeks pregnant we knew nobody in the Silicon Valley I've never left Montana and it was a huge risk because I knew nobody like we were going to get there and we are not even going to know where to have a baby at and it was a it was a giant risk and it was more risky than I even even knew about uh because I had no idea about kids like I knew nothing but if I wouldn't have done that if I wouldn't have taken that risk I think I would have looked back in life and been and been a little bit sad about that so I can I can totally understand why you should risk you know when people say this it's because you don't have any clue what it's like to have a kid or to leave your comfort zone you actually have you just you have no clue you don't know anything you don't it is very very difficult taking a job at a company in which their entire culture deck says that they will fire you fast while you're moving to a state you've never been while you're also in a place in which is completely like super expensive your wife's not going to be working you have two Labradors you have you have just absolutely no no clue and you're about to just completely lose it all potentially you have no clue at all like of course that is difficult it isn't a very stressful decision having your first kid away from family in a brand new job in which says they fire fast that's a lot uh it was extremely hard to find an apartment due to the two Labradors extremely hard to find an apartment it was the the smallest I could find a place was it took it took so long to figure that out but every place we went was like 200 per dog per month if you wish to have a dog and so now I'm sitting there thinking about do I get rid of my dogs I love my dogs I don't want to get rid of my dogs what do I do right like it was it it took a long time and we're sitting there thinking should we do this I had a great job it was tough it was real tough it was honestly one of the hardest times of my life um and I know that you think that uh oh you're working on Netflix it's easy I'm pretty sure that if anybody said they're gonna move away from everyone they know into a job that openly claims they fire fast and you have absolutely no measurement if you're a good or bad software and you're about to have a baby you wouldn't say oh that's a simple that's a simple decision of course that's an easy decision no it's it's a hard it's a hard ass decision and it was it was it was it was it was emotional but we made it because we said there's only one time in life we can make this decision that's before we have a kid because after we have our kid we're not going anywhere and it was true I stayed in the valley for six years until covid and then I moved to South Dakota afterwards and now I'm in Coven I I did that minus the baby it was tough yeah it's still tough no matter what if you go to a new area you should always take some level of risk yeah uh done uh that but as he did to China mainland from UK really that that is that is challenging that's a much different world yeah wife hates the new place and uh yeah no this is honestly our marriage went under a lot of pressure so our marriage wouldn't be what it is today without that move so I look back at that and the biggest takeaway that I got from it besides for saying I work at Netflix by the way was the fact that I that my wife and I's marriage is significantly better I'm very happy that I was able to do that um so I was happy about the pressure do I uh do you have any regrets for that no I don't have any regrets I don't try to live with regrets uh probably like the only regrets I have are people who I've hurt right I personally relate to a lot of this yeah no no I know you do too because you've you've also moved around the country and have done this I know I I know your story like there's people that I've hurt and there's two people I can think of extremely specifically there's a kid named Max in my high school who clearly had autism super smart skipped grades uh and I was very I was not nice to him uh the second person her name was Destiny uh mistreated her as a woman treated her more like an object than I did a uh than a person and I found both of them later in life sought them out found him and said sorry to both of them personally because like they deserved it they're people you know they're they're humans they feel things and they deserve to sorry and Max was most surprised Max was probably more surprised than Destiny to this day like Destiny was just like oh that was very nice of you thanks for like letting me know that I'm you know I'm actually worth something but Max was just like you're saying sorry to me I was like yeah I owe you right so it's hard you know so now yeah the thing is is you you can only say a sorry if someone doesn't accept your apology it's on them at that point honestly you know what's worse than living with you've hurt somebody is living with not forgiving somebody Real Talk lack of forgiveness will eat your heart I didn't do the 12 Steps uh and so I always I will always I will always strive for forgiveness no matter how much somebody hurts me I will I will strive for forgiveness uh when I was younger I know I know sorry I I know this is odd stuff but when I was younger I also wrote a list of everybody that I have hard I had a really rough High School experience with I can still think of a couple people that I just that just like they irked me beyond belief uh one person if I still think about I can still break out and sweat um just like I I get such an adrenal reaction but I went through that list and I kept it for a long time and anytime I got really upset I'd remind myself that here is a list of people that I have forgiven despite them not saying sorry I've forgiven them no matter what uh and because you have to you have to live life that way I don't know yeah I'm sorry for a vs code every day and not following through with them it's okay uh anyways uh why is school such a tragic it will pick a school is is is is pooling Collective ignorance you have to forgive you will find you will find forgiveness is equally as powerful for the person you forgive as it is for you you will taint your soul for the rest of your life without forgiveness um all right let's keep on going uh here we go now he believes uh taking calculated risks is necessary yep then he quoted uh Zuckerberg's most uh one of his most popular quotes the biggest risk is not taking any risk yes in a world that is changing really quickly the only strategy that is guaranteed to fail is not taking risks I agree with this playing defense loses I've always thought about that which is anytime I try to anytime I just know all I need to do is just keep doing what I'm doing and I'm gonna win like especially in like video games or anything like that I always lose because I go from playing offense to playing defense and this is true in basketball it's true in everything that I've ever played my life anytime I go from offense to defense to just keep winning I lose every single time you always have to keep going you ha you cannot just try to wait it out he gave me this advice uh so strongly as I am his daughter and he wanted me to take risk risky opportunities he is a nice man but we talk about we talked about many more topics about life work life balance and many more but these two regrets Hit me hard which is why I've shared these two points I love this this is a great story honestly these These are really good points which is learning to say no and taking risks that are calculated very very good ones very very good I actually really appreciate this article got a w key on fortnite yeah you got W key and I IRL absolutely would you forgive people who write curly braces on new lines even them even people who write curly braces and else statements all on new lines I'm willing to forgive what advice do I have well I always will I know there was a hesitation uh my you know I I don't know about my advice you know I don't know how you know I don't know if I'm old enough to give great advice wait what no that is unforgivable yeah I don't know I don't know how well my advice would be honestly um I think I kind of gave most of it which is I think pursuing forgiveness no matter the crime is good on an individual basis um I think it works good for work I think it works good in your personal life my only other really great piece of advice is there is no such thing as 50 50. if you like if me and my beautiful wife were to go 50 50 we'd both be disappointed and so I never go 50 50. when you get home ask her what she needs you know I don't do it enough and I need to do it more 50 50 doesn't work always being a Hondo hundo yeah you always be a hundred hundred right you know what I mean that's my that's my other piece of advice I I guess I have my last piece of advice would be it doesn't matter really what you do your accomplishments at your job all those things those will fade right you can be six years of amazing work and one [ __ ] up and everybody hates you right um that's why I really truly pursue curiosity because at some point I'll mess up at Netflix and they'll fire me or whatever's gonna happen but I have genuinely loved what I work on and what I do because I try to drive myself with curiosity instead of driving myself with Worth right some people program because they want their worth in it right they want to put themselves as someone who makes a Mark I don't try to make a mark in that category I do it because I am curious and I'm going to keep on fueling and making curiosity a real thing you know what I mean Tom's a genius I get that I'm not I'm not that person so guess what the name is the primogen
