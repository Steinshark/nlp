what is Occam's razor so Occam's razor says that you should not multiply entities beyond necessity which sort of if you translate it to proper English means and you know in a scientific context means that if you have two series or hypotheses or models which equally well describe the phenomenon your study or the data you should choose the more simple one so that's just the principle you're sort of that's not like a provable law perhaps perhaps we'll kind of discuss it and think about it but what's the intuition of why this simpler answer is the one that is likely to be more correct descriptor of whatever we're talking about I believe that Occam's razor is probably the most important principle in science I mean of course we need logical deduction and we do experimental design yeah but science is about finding understanding the world finding models of the world and we can come up with crazy complex models which you know explain everything but predict nothing but the simple model seem to have predictive power and it's a reliquary why and the two answers to that you can just accept it that is the principle of science and we use this principle and it seems to be successful we don't know why but it just happens to be or you can try you know find another principle which explains or comes racer and if we start with the assumption that the world is governed by simple rules then there's a bias toward simplicity and planning Occam's razor is the mechanism to finding these rules and actually in a more quantitative sense and we come back to that later and tears of Solomon reduction you can rigorously prove that usually assume that the world is simple then Occam's razor is the best you can do in a certain sense so I apologize for the romanticized question but why do you think outside of its effectiveness why do we do you think we find simplicity so appealing as human beings why does it just why does e equals MC school word seems so beautiful to us humans I guess mostly in general many things can be explained by an evolutionary argument and you know there's some artifacts and humans which you know are just artifacts and not an evolutionary necessary but with this beauty and simplicity its I believe at least the core is about like science finding regularities in the world understanding the world which is necessary for survival right you know if I look at a bush right and I just seen Norris and there is a tiger right and eats me then I'm dead but if I try to find a pattern and we know that humans are prone to find more patterns in data than they are you know like the you know Mars face and all these things but these buyers towards finding patterns even if they are not but I mean it's best of course if they are yeah helps us for survival yeah that's fascinating I haven't thought really about it I thought I just loved science but they're indeed from in terms of just survival purposes there is an evolutionary argument for why why we find the work of Einstein is so beautiful maybe a quick small tangent could you describe what Solomonov induction is yeah so that's a theory which I claim and recent long enough sort of claimed you know a long time ago that this solves the big loss of the problem of induction and I believe the claim is essentially true and what it does is the following so okay for the picky listener induction can be interpreted narrowly and wildly narrow means inferring models from data and widely means also then using these models for doing predictions or prediction is also part of of the induction so I'm little sloppy sort of as a terminology and maybe that comes from ray solomonoff you know being sloppy maybe I should say that we can't complain anymore so let me explain a little bit this theory yeah in simple terms so assume we have a data sequence make it very simple the simplest one say 1 1 1 1 1 and you see if 100 ones yeah what do you think comes next the natural order IRA speed up a little bit the natural answer is of course you know 1 ok and question is why okay well we see a pattern there yeah okay there's a 1 and we repeat it and why should it suddenly after hundred ones be different so what we're looking for is simple explanations or models for the data we have and now the question is a model has to be presented in a certain language in which language to be used in science we want formal languages and we can use mathematics or we can use programs on a computer so abstract me on a Turing machine for instance or can be a general-purpose computer so and they of course lots of models of you can say maybe it's 100 ones and 100 zeros and hundred ones that's a model right but there are simpler models there's a model print one loop and it also explains the data and if you pushed it to the extreme you are looking for the shortest program which if you run this program reproduces the data you have it will not stop it will continue naturally and this you take for your prediction and on the sequence of ones it's very plausible right at print one loop it's the shortest program we can give some more complex examples like 1 2 3 4 5 what comes next the short program is again you know counter and so that is roughly speaking how salamat of induction works the extra twist is that it can also deal with more easy data so if you have for instance a coin flip say a biased coin which comes up head with 60% probability then it will predict if you learn and figure this out and after a while it predict or the next point Li will be head with probability 60% so it's the stochastic version of that but the goal is the dream is always the search for the short program yes yeah well in Salamone of induction precisely what you do is so you combine so looking for the shortest program is like applying a purse raiser like looking for the simple theory there's also a Pecos principle which says if you have multiple hypotheses which equally well describe your data don't discard any of them keep all of them around you never know and you can put it together and say ok have a buyer's - her simplicity but I don't rule out the larger models and technically what we do is we weigh the shorter models higher and the longer models lower and you use a Bayesian techniques you have a prior and which is precisely 2 to the minus the complexity of the program and you weigh all this hypotheses and take this mixture and then you get also based elasticity in yeah like many of your ideas that's just a beautiful idea of weighing based on the simplicity of the program I love that that that seems to me may be very human centric concept seems to be a very appealing way of discovering good programs in this world you've used the term compression quite a bit I think it's a beautiful idea sort of we just talked about simplicity and maybe science or just all of our intellectual pursuits is basically the attempt to compress the complexity all around us into something simple so what does this word mean to you compression I essentially have already explained it so it compression means for me finding short programs for the data or the phenomena at hand you could interpret it more widely as you know finding simple theories which can be mathematical theory so maybe even informal you know like you know just inverts compression means finding short descriptions explanations programs raw data do you see science as a kind of our human attempt at compression so we're speaking more generally because when you say programs kind of zooming in a particular sort of almost like computer science artificial intelligence focus would you see all of human endeavor as a kind of compression well at least all of science I see as a endeavor of compression at all of humanity maybe and well there are also some other aspects of like experimental design right I mean we we create experiments specifically to get extra knowledge and this is there isn't part of the decision-making process but once we have the data to understand the data is essentially compression so I don't see any difference between contrast compression understanding and prediction so we're jumping around topics a little bit but returning back to simplicity a fascinating concept of coma girl of complexity so in your sense the most objects in our mathematical universe have high coma girl of complexity and maybe what is first of all what is coma graph complexity ok Kolmogorov complexity is the notion of simplicity or complexity and it takes the compression view to the extreme so I explained before that if you have some data sequence just think about a file in a computer and best sort of you know it's just a string of bits and if you and we have data compresses likely compress big files into sip files with certain compressors and you can also pre you self-extracting are curves that means as an executable if you run it it reproduces the original file without needing an extra decompressor it's just a decompressor plus the archive together in one and now they are better and worse compressors and you can ask what is the ultimate compressor so what is the shortest possible self-extracting archives you could produce for a certain data set yeah which reproduces the data set and the length of this is called the Kolmogorov complexity and arguably that is the information content in the data set I mean if the data set is very redundant or very boring you can compress it very well so the information content should be low and you know it is low according to this difference this is the length of the shortest program that summarizes the data yes yeah and what's your sense of our sort of universe when we think about the different the different objects in our universe that we each are concepts or whatever the at every level do they have higher or local girl complexity so what's the hope do we have a lot of hope and be able to summarize much of our world that's a tricky and difficult question so as I said before I believe that the whole universe based on the evidence we have is very simple so it has a very short description the whole sorry did you would you linger on that the whole universe what does I mean do you mean at the very basic fundamental level in order to create the universe yes yeah so you need a very short program when you run it to get the thing going you get the thing going and then it will reproduce our universe there's a problem with noise we can come back to the later possibly no is a problem or a fee is it a bug or a feature I would say it makes our life as a scientist really really much harder I didn't think about without noise we wouldn't need all of the statistics but that maybe we wouldn't feel like there's a free will maybe we need that for the odd physics this is an illusion that noise can give you free reason that way it's a feature but also if you don't have noise you have chaotic phenomena which are effectively like noise so we can't you know get away with statistics even then I mean think about rolling a dice and you know forget about quantum mechanics and you know exactly how you you throw it but I mean it's still so hard to compute a trajectory that effectively it is best to model it you know as you know coming out with a number of this probability one over six but from from this set of philosophical como go of complexity perspective if we didn't have noise then arguably you could describe the whole universe as well as standard model plus general relativity I mean we don't have a theory of everything yet but sort of assuming we are close to it or have it here plus the initial conditions which may hopefully be simple and then you just run it and then you would reproduce the universe but that's followed by noise or by chaotic systems or by initial conditions which you know may be complex so now if we don't take whole universe but just a subset you know just take planet Earth planet Earth cannot be compressed you know into a couple of equations this is a hugely complex just so interesting so when you look at the window like the whole thing might be simple when you just take a small window then it may become complex and that may be counterintuitive but there's a very nice analogy the the book the library of all books so imagine you have a normal library with interesting books and you go there great lots of information and you quite complex yeah so now I create a library which contains all possible books say of 500 pages so the first book just has a aaaa over all the pages the next book aaaa and ends with B and so on I create this library of all books I can write a super short program which creates this library so this library has all books has zero information content and you take a subset of this library and suddenly have a lot of information in there so that's fascinating I think one of the most beautiful object as magical objects that at least today seems to be under study or under talked about is cellular automata what lessons do you draw from sort of the game of life for cellular automata where you start with the simple rules just like you're describing with the universe and somehow complexity emerges do you feel like you have an intuitive grasp on the behavior the fascinating behavior of such systems where some like you said some chaotic behavior could happen some complexity could emerge some it could die out and some very rigid structures do you have a sense about cellular automata that somehow transfers maybe to the bigger questions of our universe there's a cellular automata especially economist game of life is really great because this rule are so simple you can explain it to every child and reading by hand you can simulate a little bit and you see this beautiful patterns emerge and people have proven you know that is even Turing complete you cannot just use a computer to simulate game of life but you can also use game of life to simulate any computer that is truly amazing and it's it's the prime example probably to demonstrate that various the rules can lead to very rich phenomena and people you know sometimes you know how can how is chemistry and biology is so rich I mean this can't be based on simple rules yeah but no we know quantum electrodynamics describes all of chemistry and and become later back to that I claim intelligence can be explained or described in one single equation this very rich phenomenon you asked also about whether you know I understand this phenomenon and it's probably not and this is saying you never understand really things you just get used to them and pretty using used to settle out your mother so you believe that you understand now why this phenomenon happens but I give you a different example I didn't play too much with this converse game of life but a little bit more with fractals and with the Mandelbrot set and it's beautiful you know patterns just just look Mandelbrot set and well when the computers were really slow and I just a black and white monitor and programmed my own programs on are in assembler - Wow Wow  to get these vectors on the screen and it was mesmerised and much later so I returned to this you know every couple of years and then I try to understand what is going on and you can understand a little bit so I try to derive the locations you know there are these circles and the Apple shape and then you have smaller Mandelbrot sets recursively in this set and there's a way to mathematically by solving high order polynomials to figure out where these centers are and what size there are approximately and by sort of ant mathematically approaching this problem you slowly get a feeling of why things are like they are and that sort of isn't you know first step to understanding why this rich phenomena do you think as possible what's your intuition you think it's possible to reverse engineer and find this short program that generated the these fractals sort of by what looking at the fractals well in principle yes yeah so I mean in principle what you can do is you take you know any data set you know you take these fractals or you take whatever your data set whatever you have say a picture of conveys game of life and you run through all programs you take your programs 1 2 3 4 and all these programs run them all in parallel in so called dovetailing fashion give them computational resources first one 50% second 1/2 resources and so on and let them run wait until they halt give an output compare it to your data and if some of these programs produce the correct data then you stop and then you have already some program it may be a long program because it's faster and then you continue and you get shorter and shorter programs until you eventually find the shortest program the interesting thing you can never know whether it's a short this program because there could be an even shorter program which is just even slower and you just have to wait yeah but asymptotically and actually after finite time you have this shortest program so this is a theoretical but completely impractical way of finding the underlying structure in every data set and that of a solo mode of interaction dollars and Kolmogorov complexity in practice of course we have to approach the problem more intelligently and then if you take resource limitations into account there's friends the field of pseudo-random numbers yeah and these are random that must so these are deterministic sequences but no algorithm which is fast fast means runs in polynomial time can detect that it's actually deterministic so we can produce interesting I mean random numbers may be not that interesting but just an example we can produce complex looking data and we can then prove that no fast algorithm can detect the underlying pattern which is unfortunately is it that's a big challenge for our search for simple programs in the space of artificial intelligence perhaps yes it definitely is wanted vision intelligence and it's quite surprising that it's I can't say easy army I worked really hard to find theories but apparently it was possible for human minds to find these simple rules in the universe it could have been different right it could have been different it's it's a it's inspiring you
