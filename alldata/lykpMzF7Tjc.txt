at the start of my learning the code journey I was not a productive person at all tick tock Instagram teen I'm just as familiar with these distractions as you are from school to University to teaching myself to code nowadays how many timetables or schedules I set for myself no matter how many plans I made eventually almost all of them always ended up being scrapped so last year when I got to the point where at the same time I was teaching myself the code I also took a part-time job as a teacher and I was making my first YouTube videos at the same time I figured that it was finally time to learn to manage my time today I'm gonna be giving you the four strategies that I implemented myself to manage my time as effectively as possible throughout my entire journey and I think all of these are going to be relevant to anyone especially if you are someone who feels like they're kind of stuck or if you can't really figure out how you can a manage to put in the time that you need to learn the code every day and B you can't really figure out how to use your time as effectively as possible maybe you're busy with school or maybe you still have another job or maybe if you're just wanting to find out how much effort and how much time is he actually gonna take for you to get to the point where you can learn the code effectively and get a job so at the end I'm also going to tell you exactly how many hours I usually put in every day and how many hours I was putting in in the beginning while I was still essentially learning the basics so I hope this video is going to be helpful to you but before we get into it I need to tell you that I can't pretend that I have all the answers I can't pretend that I am the perfect productivity master who knows exactly what would be applicable to you but what I can tell you are the things that I learned myself through literally studying some of the most productive and successful people in the world and the learning and productivity strategies that they use and the things that personally worked for me I remember when I started teaching myself to code exactly 537 days ago from when I'm recording this I saw all those videos of How I Learned the code in six months and I was like wow that guy must be so smart or he must have spent literally 16 hours a day working and that really wasn't the case so throughout 2021 and 2032 I was living at home and I decided to spend the whole year teaching myself to code I just said I would spend as much time as possible every single day so I could become as good as I could possibly become in a single year but the longer I went the more I realized that trying to just cramming all these hours just wasn't sustainable at all maybe sometimes when I go into a project I could really focus on it like all the time but most of the time if I just try to crack my course in a day or something I would find that none of it would even stick and it was just kind of useless but throughout this year I did learn many things about time management that I'm still implementing to this day so if that is interesting you do subscribe to the channel because I make videos like this all the time and try to post twice a week at the moment but without list getting into the strategies but first we need to thank this video sponsor sign now you remember when we used to sign documents by hand yeah me neither being able to sign documents electronically makes the whole process of document workloads so much easier so if you have a business where you need to do this then I highly recommend you check out the sign Now API which is one of the best Solutions online to get your documents signed hassle-free and easily the site Now API is easy to use and completely free to test and deploying documents with it is super fast developers particularly love their really easy to use and very understandable and detailed documentation station with clear coding examples as well as great video tutorials on how to get

out the sign Now API from the link Down Below in the description like if you sign up for sponsoring this video and now let's move on first we need to talk about schedules and this is something that might sound controversial but just bear with me here but just tell me if this has ever happened to you you make yourself a schedule you tell yourself oh I'm gonna stick to this schedule from now on every single day and you manage to do it for like two days but after that you simply fall off and you're no longer able to stick to it and then you just get demotivated then you go back to your ways of just scrolling on Instagram or whatever I would do this so many times I would watch a video from YouTube from like Matt diabella or something on like time management I would be like yes I'm gonna give myself a set schedule yeah the reality was that I stuck to it for like a couple of weeks and then after that I just couldn't do it anymore because it was so sort of restricting I tried to fit every single day and this is one rigid schedule so I think what you want to do instead and what I've been doing and it's working really well is that when you wake up in the morning you figure out what are the most important things that you want to get done today so essentially instead of scheduling everything in advance you just figure out the tasks that you need to do and then based on what responsibilities and what things you need to do that day you figure out in order of importance in what order you want to do these tasks you try to estimate how long they're gonna take and sort of you go day by day or maybe a couple of days in advance because things are always going to happen and doing that every single morning I find that I still keep most of the benefits of having a schedule but I retain the flexibility to allow for things to just happen during the day and I know now you're gonna say oh but how can I actually motivate myself to actually do this tasks and I'll talk about that in a second but first what is actually the way to get these tasks done every day like as efficiently as possible without wasting time and especially without burning out the mistake people do people think that they just need to like cram out as many hours as possible and that's just not the way to go at all like it's been shown so many times that as humans we have a very limited energy that we can use in a day to like do very effective work so if you're trying to do too much it's just gonna be counterproductive because Beyond a certain point the extra time that you spend at a task is just going to take away from your recovery and from your ability to perform the next day and so the solution that I have for this and this is especially important for people like me who have a lot of different things like all these different things that they want to do it's fine to have a couple of like sort of projects that you're working on at a given moment but you don't want to spread yourself too thin by like just working on seven different things at the same time because really you're not going to be able to put in enough effort to any single one of these to actually get somewhere and I realized that actually knowing what is most important can it be challenging and this is something you'll learn about practice but in general when it comes to coding in the beginning if you're learning something new your focus should be on like doing a basic course or a basic program on this new skill and then after that your main focus should just be doing so building projects using this new technology rather than trying to learn like every single Advanced feature in advance and before you go on to learn something new it's probably usually more valuable for you to just get really good at one technology or maybe one language or one type of programming than trying to learn like five of them at the same time okay so in summary so far you have implemented the strategy of figuring out the tasks that you need to do every single day and all of these tasks are ideally related to the most important projects or the most important things that you're working on and getting a moment so then how do we actually make sure that we get these things done efficiently without spending a lot of time necessarily and without spending like two years actually getting good at the language or something and the solution for this is a very popular sort of time management strategy which is called time boxing or time blocking some people call it and this is literally the strategy that Elon Musk so Elon Musk is like he's building like five companies at the same time he's trying to get Humanity to Mars he's doing like a million things at the same time now this is literally the strategy that he has talked about that he uses for his diet so you know that this works the idea is that when you come up with a thing that you need to do like let's say there's a bug in your project that you want to fix in step one you've estimated how much time doing that task is going to take you and then what you're going to do is you're gonna block out from your calendar literally at like a two hour window for example if it's gonna take you two hours to do it and then doing that two hours you're only allowed to focus on that particular task you throw out your phone you don't let anyone this attract you and during that two hours you're only doing deep work to focus on that specific task and this is super super important you'll find that within like four to six hours in a day or even less you're gonna be able to get done more than you would do in like 12 hours before because that is the power of deep work so then lastly now let's talk about motivation and again this is a topic that I sort of love and hate at the same time I think okay the motivation is the kind of thing that most people will wait for before they even do anything people will always ask me how do I stay motivated how do I get motivated to go to the gym how do I get motivated to learn the code and really in the beginning you're probably not going to be motivated right because you're probably not going to be very good at coding and if you haven't ever gone to the gym you're probably not going to be very good at you know training at the gym so you're gonna feel afraid you're gonna feel like sluggish you're not gonna feel like starting I've talked about this concept of the dip before in one of my videos when I couple of my videos but essentially the way it works in the very very beginning when you sort of hear about the idea and the potential results of learning the code or of going to the gym you're going to be super motivated because you're just going to think about the end result you're going to think about oh I'm gonna get so henched or I'm gonna get a super high paying job but once you sort of start when you get started you realize just how hard getting to this end goal actually so you ended this like dip and this is the place where 99 of people will quit they will stop because they will not have the motivation to get going so at this point that you should just completely ignore motivation instead just focus on having discipline build the self-discipline to be able to do the hard work and to push past this dip even when you don't want to even when you don't feel like it you wanna live your life based on just doing all the things that you really want to do in the Moment Like that's why like you can do whatever you want but if you live like that I can tell you that you're never gonna get anywhere with anything because anything worth achieving is always going to be hard with all of these strategies in mind how many hours does it actually take you to get really good at coding how many hours did I spend every single day learning the code for like more than a year now and I hate to give this answer but it depends and I know this is the most annoying answer in the world so I'm actually going to try to analyze this a bit in the beginning I think because doing this Gap year that I had I was pretty much focused on learning the code almost full time at all I did have as I said my part-time jobs are in the days I was working it was maybe like a part-time thing of learning the code so if you want an answer maybe it was like four to six hours a day on average but not all of that would be like deep work some of it will be like shallow work of like watching videos or something like not super important stuff but like in terms of you I would say two hours a day is a good Target for every single person like it doesn't matter if you have a job it doesn't matter if you're already at school like you should be able to put in two hours like whether it's in the morning before you go to school or it's in the evening before you go to school or work or whatever you should be able to put in at least one deep work Block in a day to achieve like at least one important task in a day so if you want like practical advice from this video for every single day figure out one thing that you want to achieve in terms of coding maybe it's completing a section of a course maybe it's completing a part of a project whatever it is one important goal that's like at the top of the hierarchical thing that's going to be most important to you to get towards your goals and you block out time from your day wherever you feel like you can fit it in for like two to three hours and you just focus on the thing doing those two to three hours and I promise you you are going to start achieving things so if you want practical advice then there you go that's my recommendation I hope that helps you if you want to hear more you can watch this video right now and one last thing is that I'm doing another free live stream this time will be coding a react application that's coming up on the 15th of December that's going to be linked Down Below in the description I highly recommend you go sign up for it hope to see you there and I hope you
