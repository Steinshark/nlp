ladies and gentlemen have any of you gotten into chess chess is a fascinating game full of complexity and wonder but it's not really Progressive and what I mean by that is we don't allow our Kings to touch the kings are in a class of their own they're a noble breed they don't interact with other pieces very well they can only move one step at a time and there is a barrier natural or materialized created between the White and the black king they are not allowed to interact first of all I think you should be able to capture the king in Chess I think if you miss a check you should just lose because they take your king I think that should be added as a rule but that's a separate note chess is not a very Progressive game but in today's video I will be sharing with you a game played between two elite players not three hundreds not six hundreds where the Kings touched it was a Monumental moment in chess history it created one of the funniest bloopers in chess history that's all I have to say uh let's jump over here it's 2019 and we are in India actually it's 2023 and I'm currently sitting in New York where are you watching from by the way let me know in uh let me know in those comments uh this is the rapid and Blitz championship being played uh in India and it's virid Gujarati and hikarana kamorna you might be asking yourself Levy how did two kings touch in a 2700 game well that's the purpose of the video now obviously it's not gonna happen early we got to get through some degree of a game but no worries you're going to learn a few things it's going to be a fun back and forth clash and at the end you will see how a couple of super Grand Masters touch their kings in the center of the board and know that is not a euphemism began the game with D4 uh that it is the second highest rated player in India number one tough tough fact to follow of course being vishwanathan who is five-time world champion Hikaru plays E6 but it plays Knight F3 D5 and now we have a transposition to the Queen's Gambit declined the only reason that the Queen's Gambit declined is not played via this move order more often uh is because white can play Knight C3 so black does it this way uh and uh now we have a slightly different move order and vidit doesn't play the Catalan with G3 Vida chooses to play the classical Queen's Gambit with the two knights now black has no less than like seven decent options here one is to play the semi-slav one is to play the semitaresh one is to play the Vienna one is to play the rogoza and one is to play the Queen's Gambit declined one is to play this version of the Queen's Gambit declined one is to play A6 which is actually what Hikaru did in the game and I guess black can also maybe play H6 uh which is some recent sideline with Bishop D6 and Knight C6 uh Hikaru plays A6 now the idea of A6 is that you are not committing the development of this bishop yet you don't know if you want to go to E7 or to B4 and the other idea is that you would like to take on C4 and then defend the pawn with B5 okay and if white plays something like E3 in this position then you're gonna wait for this bishop to move and then you're going to take so now white spun two Tempi and now black will go here and here so normally what white does in order to take advantage of the person playing with black that you spent the tempo playing this move is white will capture on D5 this is kind of considered the meta strategy of the opening and now basically white is arguing that the move A6 is obsolete uh black plays he takes D5 Bishop to G5 pins the Knight to the queen uh Bishop E7 from Hikaru which is a normal move uh actually I uh I I am creating an opening repertoire based around the A6 Queen's Gambit declined and I really like a setup here by black to play C6 first and then after white plays E3 which is a natural developing move uh black plays Bishop F5 trying to trade the bishop off on that square I I personally I find these structures to be really really easy to play for black uh and uh relatively straightforward I'm not saying I'm improving hikaru's play by any means I'm just simply saying that you know for 99 of the chess audience currently watching this I think the A6 Queen's Gambit declined is a really really good repertoire for black and there are some nice ways to play it so we have E3 Hikaru attacks the bishop Bishop H4 now kikaru plays C6 right so we I just talked about C6 the idea is that black wants to put a bishop out and then black wants to play Knight bd7 this is Rock Solid white is probably going to play things like Rook B1 B4 A4 B5 this is called minority attack because white has uh three pawns on this side of the board and uh black has uh four pawns on that side of the board but saying the words minority attack in 2023 is very quickly turned into some meme uh because uh such as such as the internet so it's really uh it's it's it's tough to use that phrase because uh the uh the average teenager's uh viewer uh viewers start turning it into some nonsense so Queen C2 played by white the idea is to take away the natural developing square of the bishop and also now Bishop G4 is just a silly move because there's no pin so white just goes here uh so Queen C2 and Hikaru just keeps his position solid and then offers an exchange to visit so he's not playing in the principled way he's not castling he's making multiple moves with the same p with pieces multiple times and he gets this and then he doesn't even Castle here he comes back right but it's Blitz all right keep in mind that this is a th this is a a Speed game ultimately and uh they started the game with uh just five minutes on the clock so you can play like this because you can play a lot of quick moves and you're not taking a huge amount of risk and uh if you still wonder why the Kings haven't touched is because they're they're not going to just it's it's not like a meeting of two world leaders okay they don't just roll out a red carpet and a hundred people stand there saluting and no no no absolutely massive uh battles have to take place uh in order for uh for the Kings to clear a path out for one another now um Vivid here should probably play something like rookie one Rook C1 and slowly prepare E4 but I think he just kind of was like look Hikaru was wasting a lot of time his Bishop is stuck behind a bunch of pieces uh I don't think Hikaru has played this the right way his King is still in the center so I'm gonna go E4 but now you see all of his Advantage go away right uh it would have been better for white to keep a little bit of tension because it's very common in these positions for black to actually uh only look like they are in a bit of a weak spot and the point is that after Pawn takes Knight takes first of all black had to take here why why did Black have to take because otherwise I would have done E5 and that would have been really bad space wise and then black would have had a really good uh really big problems but um you take once and you relieve the pressure but it's not Checkers this might come as a shock to you but this is not a Gotham Checkers Channel although I I do like myself some Checkers and some droughts I I uh I do enjoy it very much for one simple reason all the pieces move the same uh and when you can capture you have to capture and in chess none of those things exist so black doesn't have to take just because he can and even then like he could have been fine but he just castles and it actually doesn't make any difference that vidit lines up The Rook to the queen because the queen just moves out of the way and like okay you can walk into the black position but I got news for you are you really going to take the bishop like if I go here are you really gonna go here you're going to trade a knight which moved one two three four times and took a bishop dead in the corner that not only hasn't moved it not only hasn't moved it hasn't seen the light of day it never even had a chance all right it perished off the face of the planet before it could make something out of itself all right no that's not any good so vidit goes to C5 instead why does he go to C5 because if Hikaru would have taken on C5 I think this was vivid's idea improving the situation of his isolated Pawn going here and restricting Black's pieces of course the position is equal all right but so Hikaru plays Knight D5 but it plays A3 taking away Knight B form and Hikaru plays A5 all right A5 has a couple of ideas first of all it prevents B4 second of all you might go A4 third of all you might go B6 and Bishop A6 uh vidit takes puts this Knight on E5 and now we have the following position uh after 20 moves it's a tense position for sure now again to to most of you watching most of you are probably like uh I don't know 1500 and below I would say probably 98 of you maybe you're a little bit higher than that and you still watch my videos and you haven't turned into one of those folks like Gotham is just chess entertainment you can't actually load anything on his channel the only thing you gotta watch the door explorers have a chance to learn anything that's generally what happens when you get too much ELO and you know you you let it get to your head you become an elitist you can't watch guess the ELO anymore you get offended it's 20 23. all right if you haven't filled your daily offended at something quota you really you're not living like the right way in 2023. um so I know that this position might not look that interesting all right to most of the audience because you're like no one's hung like three queens yet all right that's typical low ELO jazz so white has what's called an isolated Pawn it's a pawn that has no neighbors all right CNE uh and uh a good way to play against an isolated upon is to create a blockade which is very much what Hikaru has done and then the more pieces that get traded the weaker the pawn becomes because the pawn cannot move forward also it loses its supporters now the person who plays around the isolated Pawn also has advantages because with no neighbors it means the lines and the diagonals are open so it means that you can actually Zig and zag around your pawn and create threats oh my God create threads like this right so check here Bishop to E4 vidit does that so he weakens this and now the king is in the corner uh rook d8 and like I said so you see videos playing around the isolated Pawn which is exactly what you want to do now a couple of Dynamics exist between these pieces like which of these pieces would you like to trade I mean in a perfect world if black was to land the trade of the light squared Bishops maybe black would be happy but really this Knight is the problem I mean it's it's not the bishop so Hikaru just stubbornly goes back to G8 vidit plays G3 both guarding the F4 square and preparing potentially expanding here and now we have Bishop F5 it's a very tense position all right Rook to D2 Hikaru now offers an exchange of Queens because like I said when you're playing against an isolated Pawn you kind of want to trade some pieces now this video want a queen trade uh probably not and like look how quickly things can go from bad to worse if you trade a couple of times now black is better because black traded and now this Pawn is weak that a pawn restricts the movement of the queen side I talked about that earlier and the more pieces that get traded the less valuable the Knight is and on top of that the Knight can just be booted like at some point you can just play F6 okay now you won't be playing moves like F6 with Queens on the board so we have Knight to C4 and Vivid says all right I will trade Queens I will but only if my Pawn goes here and now I have Knight D6 and Knight B6 all right and I got open Rooks and now actually taking on D5 is not so bad for me because I'm gonna get a pawn there and I can create a target for my pieces so everything in Chess at the highest level comes down to just one square one exchange Hikaru is like nope no trade now if it says time to remove that blockade all right we're removing the blockade of the isolated Pawn Knight takes C3 Rook E3 and fe3 are both good I actually like this more because the pawn now has a friend all right vidit doesn't want the pawn to have friends though Rook takes C3 only only thing the pawn can do is sit at home and study for tests uh no friends so it still looks pretty good right I mean the pressure still looks like it's on black but somehow black is just Rock Solid all right and uh he's got the three and three cluster everything is looking good Bishop B3 the kings are still far apart I know I know the kings are still far apart I know but it's worth watching listen if I just skip to the moment where the king's touched like what it's like you buy a movie ticket to watch Avengers you show up the climax of the movie happens you you leave really you'd be happy first of all movie tickets in America are now like twenty dollars I don't know what movie tickets cost in LA in Europe like going to the cinema but here in in the States you pay 18 to see a movie then you pay 17 for a hot dog that's been sitting out for two weeks and popcorn that tastes like someone's been spitting in it for a month all right then the Butter's rotten you spend 40 in the movie theater all right then you gotta go to the you gotta go to the hospital because the popcorn made you sick and then the ambulance costs 20 grand and then in the hospital they charge you another six thousand dollars all right yeah I mean it's crazy you just spend thirty thousand dollars going to the movie theater you're welcome welcome to the US Queen C3 back Rook A5 H4 seriously Healthcare Systems is single-handedly the biggest scam if if not student loans Rook B5 Queen B6 we are now entering the phase of every Hikaru game where he slowly and methodically outplays his opponent both on the clock and on the board from a position that seemingly has nothing there Hikaru and Magnus are very similar like that they're very cunning in their ways like rugby three and just just asking questions he's not interested in in Checkmate he's just like I'm just I got some questions for you all right now according to the computer white can sacrifice The Rook here and play Bishop C4 and Bishop E6 but that's ridiculous like there's no obvious answer to why you would do that so if it goes here Queen B3 and Bishop D5 and again Hikaru is slightly better why is kikaru slightly better because throughout this game vidit has had an isolated pawn and he didn't do his Pawn any favors and notice how look like look at vidit's position all right now Look at video position about 15 moves ago he just never really made any progress he kind of shuffled and shuffled and made a trade of knights but you see how kikaru now starts taking over this is like this is the stage of the game he's going to take over the game over an opponent that's very very very good all right Bishop D5 keeping the tension everything kikaru is doing here is making small improvements Bishop B3 all right now we are down to a spot and here come the Kings baby here come the Kings oh we getting there yes sir oh yes there we go they were both on G1 and G8 But Here Come the Kings all right embracing their roles in this game um remember I told you a long time ago that if you trade a lot of pieces in an isolated Pawn position what's gonna happen is that that pawn is going to become weak and and maybe this Pawn will be a Target throughout this game all right so Rook D3 now you'll notice that Hikaru is he might trade Bishop skills so might not trade Bishops King F6 Rook C3 I write King back Bishop C4 all right and now hikaru's messed up a little bit because we're in a rook end game and he has to defend but he can't defend like this so he has to play Rook A8 let me tell you something right now ain't nobody winning this game with a rook on A8 right rook in six versus rook and six this is not going to happen so if it plays Rook before Hikaru plays Rook A7 and brings his King here come the Kings there we go they're getting closer all right they're still getting closer now hey caru's still a little bit better a little bit better but here Hikaru gives up his a pawn for a b-pawn now vidit doesn't like that apparently that was the way to play but it doesn't like that so he plays King C2 hikaru's still asking questions using this Pawn as an anchor into the white position now Rook C3 so Rook C3 is a is a fascinating move because in every single Rook end game frankly in any end game period there is this moment where if you trade everything and you go to a King and pawn end game is it winning is it a draw or is it losing and according to the computer it thinks that black is winning if he trades the the Rooks it just thinks that this end game is a win for for black all right it thinks that white does not have enough Pawn Mobility the engine also might not fully understand it at a low enough depth so Rook B5 Hikaru doesn't do it because it's a massive commitment he's not sure yet and he doesn't want to kill off his winning chances all right so Hikaru plays G5 all right but he loses the A4 Pawn but he's gonna go here now we have take take F4 take take take all right we are down to three pawns each surely this has to be a draw but where are the Kings gonna touch I am ready for some Kings touching each other ah oh no oh but the king's coming forward car plays F5 video plays Rook C4 Hikaru drives the Rook down hits the pawn on B2 King defense King moves forward Rook C5 King E6 the foreplay is just ridiculous B4 Rook F3 check now if you play King C4 B5 is borderline mate white has to sacrifice The Rook so the King goes back rookie three vid it plays B5 we have takes take down to two pawns each down to two pawns each I want to see some oiled up King wrestling let's go F4 by black king C2 F3 black is trying to promote But Here Comes the king oh but now F2 wait a minute this is really tricky you can't take the Rook because I'm gonna promote Rook B1 and Hikaru finds just as you need Hikaru on the 66th move of the game with 10 seconds on the clock finds the only winning idea in the position which is the move Rook to be three and the idea is that this is a deflection and if the Rook moves something to H1 I'm gonna win your Pawn go here and bring my king and win the game so vidit in this position needs to play Rook to F1 but now folks is the moment you have all been waiting for I will now show you the clip shout out to chess base Indio by the way live the footage from the venue as the Kings touched in this game and not only that I will narrate it for you you see the position on the board Hikaru just played Rook B3 vidit just played Rook B1 Rook F1 sorry here we go Hikaru shaking his head slides his King but it takes the pawn but now there's a rook trade King E3 with it three seconds trade trade we've entered a king and pawn end game and here is the move heard around the world as Vivid Gujarati plays King E3 what a moment vidit instant replay VAR confirms it King to E3 on the board can we just commend vidit Gujarati for breaking the boundaries of the game this is some this is some seriously important stuff I think not just for society uh but also just uh in general I mean big picture not just for uh for the human race for all potential Intergalactic uh species that are out there and races that are out there that do I think we can co-exist in harmony you know I think that we should break down uh the artificial barriers that we have created not just not just for chess Kings but uh all humans in general so vidded in this position plays King to E3 realizes immediately that he can't do it and he carves like what and so so it's an illegal move hikaru's time is ticking by the way he almost loses on time I don't know if you see look at that look he's got two seconds and then he paused the clock uh and um essentially what happens when you make an illegal move is they take the clock and they actually bash you over the head with it that wasn't caught on camera no they just give the the the party that was wronged an extra minute of time generally in the Blitz game uh now I for okay I'm a Believer in the fact that black should just take White's King here like I think taking the king should just be legal uh this is a hilarious moment now clearly this is a blooper that it had no time on the clock uh it happens well no it actually like it actually very much does not happen this is so um in this position uh Hikaru played King D5 and and white is losing and vid it with no time on the clock just goes to a King and pawn end game he doesn't have to he could have tried to win this Pawn with his King like King E2 King D4 King F2 uh but this is probably still losing he would have maybe had to to give a check and then try to you know draw this position but this is very very tricky but instead of that he did this and this is losing but here vidit tried to do that that's what he tried to do now the funny thing is that I I actually think this is probably still losing after King C3 but I'm not sure uh now we will of course finish the game uh what vidit really wanted to play with something like this uh he plays King F3 which is sort of the same thing but this is actually losing because black plays B5 and the king is shouldering White's King away so the king tries to come here but the black king is shouldering the king and this is a losing King and pawn end game it's a losing King and pawn end game because there's a red carpet for the pawn so side defense always wins the the the aggressive King has to be standing in front of the pawn and on the side of it ideally and it doesn't matter had video gun King E2 would have been the same thing King C3 uh let's say you know A4 uh black would go king before King C4 and again the king is on the side and the pawn has a red carpet for it uh you know even B5 is winning because you have to know opposition and this is completely winning but uh yeah pretty hilarious moment in this game and it was a good back and forth game that nice instructive game as well um King's touched for the first time ever I think in in Elite competition I've never seen something like this uh but I hope I see more of it in the future you know what I mean because this the this really humanizes the top players I feel like I feel like this is uh this is the good stuff this is the good stuff and um yeah once again um if you'd like a really funny clip I can't show it to you uh in this video because it's got a copyrighted a song in it it's called King sacrifice it's got 36 million views it's a clip and um I can't show it to you because I don't want to get my video demonetized but um it's got a very funny animated sequence for when this moment happens it's a very very funny moment uh and I just wanted to uh I wanted to share this fun game with you because we don't get a lot of moments like this and when you play online you can't even make these moves all right now personally I believe that King should be able to be captured you leave the king hanging they should be able to take it all right uh that's all for today shout out to chess base India once again for this clip and um I'll see you in the next one there will be no Kings touching but there will be something epic get out of here
