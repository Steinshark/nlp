hello everyone and welcome 1 000 horsepower in a naturally aspirated street legal emissions compliant engine that is going in the aston martin valkyrie so that is going to be the main topic of this video and we're also going to look at another engine used in the gordon murray t-50 which in many ways is the successor to the mclaren f1 which also has a very impressive naturally aspirated very high revving over 12 000 rpm uh engine going in it now both of these engines are naturally aspirated both of these engines are v12s they're both at a 65 degree angle they both rev well past 10 000 rpm and they're both made by cosworth so it's very easy to be like oh those are similar hence i put the two together in a video but in reality they're completely separate projects and you should not think of them as being related so let's start off with the aston martin valkyrie again this is a 65 degree naturally aspirated v12 engine it is 6.5 liters so it is certainly a healthy size here we have a simplified diagram of what this engine looks like it's producing a thousand horsepower at 10 500 rpm and 546 pound-feet of torque at 7000 rpm and revs all the way to 11 100 rpm now air is going to come from the front of the car which will be up here it will then come back then be routed into each side of this intake plenum so i've kind of split how this is drawn we're kind of looking above the engine here and then somewhat inside the engine on this side here so that air will come back from the front of the car from a hood scoop and then be routed through the two throttle bodies into the intake plenum and then sent down through each of those six individual runners on each side going to each cylinder bank and so then those exhausts are split they don't all go into one and so when they were actually developing this engine they made a inline three cylinder engine to see if they could get it to rev at these high rpm make the power that they wanted and still be emissions compliant using a single catalytic converter with that three cylinder and it worked out so then they scaled up and you now have a v12 so four sets of these three cylinder engines and then each has its own catalytic converter so four of them total before everything ends up going to the back now one of the unique challenges with this engine of course the aston martin valkyrie is designed to be as light as possible and so as a result the engine is used as a structural member of the vehicle so it's actually what holds together the front and the rear of the car in doing so you kind of simplify things you allow the engine to serve multiple purposes not only is it powering the vehicle but it's also structural so you can help reduce weight but the challenge then of course is the stresses put on that engine and so as you can imagine this is also a very high downforce vehicle so aston martin's saying about 4 000 pounds of down force being pressed down on this vehicle so on top of its own weight your vehicle suspension is holding that car and then it's also carrying the load of that down force and so you have that pressure uh with both of these wheels pushing up and basically what they're doing is they're forcing the top of this engine to be compressed and the bottom of that engine is in tension basically it's just trying to take the engine and throw it out the bottom so there's a lot of stresses being placed on this engine and so that's kind of some of the unique challenges there of keeping it light but also making sure it can handle all of that stress and they were able to keep the weight at about 450 pounds a little over 200 kilograms which is quite impressive now as far as how this engine actually creates a thousand horsepower there's three things i want to focus on first being displacement size of course does matter for engines second i'm going to talk about brake mean effective pressure and then third we're going to talk about rpm the higher you can get that engine to rev the more power you can make so starting off with displacement this is a 6.5 liter engine a thousand horsepower means it's making 153.8 horsepower per liter which beats everything else naturally aspirated before it by a long shot now they haven't released what the actual dimensions of these cylinders are which i was very curious about to see how fast these piston speeds were actually in there however in an interview with corfection cosworth revealed that their piston speeds are somewhere between 25 and 26 meters per second those are the average piston speeds so we can use the simple formula for average piston speed equals two times stroke times rpm divided by 60 and that allows us to calculate what the stroke would be so it's going to be somewhere between 67.6 millimeters and 70.3 millimeters so a fairly short stroke which is fairly obvious it would have a short stroke and that way it can rev up really high the bore using volume equals pi r squared times stroke you can calculate to be somewhere between 101 and 99 millimeters so your pistons uh the stroke path that they actually travel and they're bore somewhere in between this range right here next let's get into break mean effective pressure now if you haven't yet watched my video on break mean effective pressure i'd highly recommend doing so but ultimately we're looking at this vehicle here has a peak b map of 14.3 bar at 7000 rpm and that comes down to about 13.1 at its peak power which is at 10 500 rpm and 14.3 is very good but it's nothing unheard of so you know it's not like this engine is breaking any laws out there it's well within normal regions for a good naturally aspirated engine and the key to all of this is really optimizing that airflow for the engine so as you have that intake air coming in and then passing into this intake manifold you're going to have all these different pistons of course with your intake valves opening and closing what you want to make sure happens is as you have that air rushing to go in an engine cylinder and then you close that intake valve that of course creates a high pressure area as all that air is being thrown this direction and then a valve says nope you're not getting in so you create that high pressure region and that high pressure region starts bouncing around in this intake manifold and you want to time that so that high pressure region then passes over and works perfectly with a cylinder that is just opening its intake valve so you have that high pressure occur right when the intake valve opens you force in a little bit extra air within that cylinder and you're able to make more torque per liter moving on to our third element here rpm so power is a function of rpm if you hold everything else constant and you're able to rev higher you will make more power and so for this vehicle we are making 546 pound-feet of torque at 7000 rpm we can calculate how much power that is 546 times 7000 rpm divided by 5252 and that gives us 728 horsepower at 7000 rpm and kind of really cool what happens with this engine as each 1000 rpm that you add if you rev up to uh 8 000 rpm you're a little bit above 800 horsepower and if you rev up to 9000 rpm well you're just below 900 horsepower so basically with this engine if they're able to contain and keep that brake mean effective pressure high then they're able to add 100 horsepower for every thousand rpm they can add so by the time it gets to 10 500 rpm it is capable of producing a thousand horsepower and you know this sounds crazy because the number is higher than other vehicles that we see but if you were to think about a two-liter engine revving to 5500 rpm making 160 horsepower it wouldn't sound all that crazy and this is actually representative of what this is all we're doing is nearly tripling the size of the engine and then doubling the rpm thus doubling the airflow and then because it's three times the size this is over you know six times the airflow another interesting feature of this engine is that the camshafts are actually gear driven rather than using a timing belt or timing chain and this simply has to do with how high the thing is revving so it's revving to 11 100 rpm using a chain at those speeds can be a bit risky uh so it uses a gear driven system so ultimately you have your crankshaft which will eventually work its way to the camshaft the camshafts will be rotating at half the speed of that crankshaft so this is actually fairly common for race engines it's just less common with road engines and one of the interesting things about how they implemented it is that it's actually at the back of the engine usually you will find these timing gears you would it would make more sense for them to go out the other end of the engine for packaging reasons it would keep things a little bit shorter but because that would be right behind the driver you'd have these gears all right behind the driver sitting in that cockpit the nvh the noise and vibration this wouldn't be ideal to have right behind that driver when you'd rather probably hear that streaming engine than some gear backlash so they have moved that to behind the engine so it's further away from the driver isolating that noise a bit more and allowing you to hear the things that you really want to hear now something absolutely fascinating about this engine is that it only uses port fuel injection it does not have direct injection and so the reason they said they did this is because when they used direct injection they had to have a particulate filter in the emissions equipment in order to compensate for it however they found that with port injection they could meet their power targets and not have that particulate filter so they went with port injection what's interesting is that you just very rarely see this with really high performance engines and there's a reason for that so you may see engines use both that are you know real high performance engines using both port and direct but often what happens is once you get up into the high rpm region once you get into that high load region they're only using this direct injector and reason being is there's a cooling effect and so when you choose between port and direct you're choosing where you want that cooling effect to happen as that fuel changes from a liquid to a vapor and so if you have it happen within the cylinder like with direct injection you cool the temperatures within that cylinder and as a result you're able to reduce overall temperatures and which means you're allowed to use more ignition advance which allows for you to make more power you don't run into engine knocks so it's a really safe way to make lots of power using port injection you also have that cooling effect obviously but it happens before the air gets into the engine so what you're doing is you're creating denser cooler air that you're then putting in the engine so you can put a little bit more of it you can put a little more air and fuel in however that cooling effect happened outside so your overall temperatures because you've packed in a little more air and fuel are still going to increase and so because of that you have a slight tendency to have run into knock a bit more meaning you can't use quite as much timing so there are performance benefits to going just direct injection however in this case they have gone with just port injection in order to make this thing meet emissions targets so i am curious what the compression ratio is of the engine they have not released this so it will be interesting to see what it is but i imagine it might be slightly lower than some of the top end engines out there simply uh because we know it's running port injection and because these brake mean effective pressures are within you know a reasonable range so cool nonetheless and many of you may wonder well what's the reliability of something like this going to be and their target is a hundred thousand kilometers an actual target of this is how long we want it to last and then after that it's probably you know not the best it's not going to be broken but they would assume you might replace it at 60 000 miles and that may not sound like much but if you consider what this engine is doing how high it's revving the kind of power it's making that's a very impressive number because race engines aren't going around for 60 000 miles and this is very close to what this is you know pretty impressive that you can go that long and maintain this kind of performance and then after that shore uh you've got to replace it but if you're you're paying for a car in this category uh you're probably not too worried about having a engine only last 60 000 miles which is quite a long time it's it's a couple road trips so finally let's discuss this gordon murray t-50 the successor to the mclaren f1 and they claim this is a 3.9 liter 65 degree naturally aspirated v12 engine revving to 12 100 rpm so another thousand rpm over what this one was doing though in a smaller package now i put quotes around 3.9 liters because it's really a four liter engine if you look at uh the cubic centimeters this is a 3.98 liter engine so i think they didn't want to call it a 4 liter engine so it isn't quite 4 liters but if you were to round you would never round 3.98 to 3.9 so either way it's basically a 4 liter v12 smaller of course than this one here but revving higher and because it revs higher that actually does give them a power per liter advantage so 650 horsepower divided by 3.98 about 163 horsepower per liter rather than that 153.8 so this shattered everything before it and then this comes along not too long after and blows it out of the water now in an interview with top gear gordon murray said one of the really cool things about the mclaren f1 was how quickly it revved while in neutral so he said it could jump 10 000 rpm per second which was kind of a target that he wanted to say you know for this engine i also want to make sure it has that really high revving happy revving nature there is no flywheel on this engine i just go straight to the clutch and so the interesting thing here is that instead of 10 000 rpm jumps per second it is capable of 28 000 rpm per second now of course it doesn't rev that high it just revs to 12. but it just means it takes a fraction of a second if it's in neutral to rev up so it behaves like a really tiny engine as far as how quickly it revs but you know it's a it's a four liter v12 it's nothing to be ashamed of so both of these very cool engines hope you all have enjoyed watching if you have any questions or comments of course feel free to leave them below thanks for watching
