ladies and gentlemen Sometimes the best things in life come at you completely unexpected and I'm hoping that is the way you feel after watching today's video you see I'm 28 years old and I've been playing chess for nearly my entire life and chess has never been more popular than it is right now incredibly talented individuals from all sorts of walks of life are giving the game a try and I had an opportunity to play with two very talented individuals who actually play in the National Basketball Association for the Philadelphia 76ers I'm talking about DeAnthony melt and Paul Reed you see I had the honor and the privilege to be invited to the Philadelphia 76ers training facility in Camden New Jersey and we played basketball and we play chess this was recorded before my New York Knicks played the 76ers in the playoffs now I would have loved to film some content with the Knicks but I don't think they have a chess player on their team but Josh Hart hit me up so this video split into two parts in part one I played DeAnthony and Paul two on1 in a chess game and after that we had a basketball shootout we each took 25 three-point shots and then we subtracted the difference and they took that amount of Pieces away from for me in a chess game and then we played game number two now I went into this thinking that if I took 25 three-point shots I would hit zero of them but as fate would have it I would have the most clutch basketball performance of my entire life all right enjoy game number one we got to shake hands oh right what's up guys how's it going let's get it 211 versus chance Master you'll get revenge later so I think I think for us our first move after talking it over I think think we're going to go we're going to move here yeah we want to we want to be able to open up our pieces I think get to the middle get to the middle the paint is that what that is control the paint like yeah I I guess I'll I'll strike back right away I feel like we go here the force on to play right here but I'm I'm not forced to go here I guess I could do a lot of stuff I'll capture oh yeah go crazy go crazy we got to take him make sure we straight though [Laughter] you never know guys I have a question answer answer are you the uh two best players chess on the team low key I probably say yeah all right lowkey or high key can't you prove it can't you just play one-on-one uh don't nobody said we do be playing but we be playing we the only we the only ones that really be like running the you feel me anybody else hop on they game whoop yeah they Str conditioning though Kyon they like that he's up there believe in Ste I think we should go right here bro hold on we can't you just go that's it's a good plan cuz if you just go here I'm going to take I'm protecting I think we got yeah I like to call that like a building block like Legos and then you go here you get a little Pawn chain yeah for sure not if he try to go any of them two places all what what if I play this I feel like it starts to develop him and let him be more aggressive out there I get him engaged I would say that but oh you want look at his we go look at his Queen right here though yeah if you put the bishop there I would have taken but now I can't take man I we were going to play Bishop there I was like I was getting hyped this why two on1 is good yeah I somebody could talk you out of a potentially bad idea all right I'm going to prepare what you think Knight to C5 this one right there I don't think that's a bad move at all him that's a good move I don't think that's a move at all this now let's see what he going to do you feel me it's going deter a lot right yeah this going this might change the game no it's not going to change much I just got to play defense see see now you can't now you can't Castle how you you could he had to back up a little bit now now we now he giving us an advantage what what's the basketball analogy right here you just made me uh back up and guard the uh the threat we just pressured with little Corral little crow you know what mean back him up he not going straight to the rim he not going straight to the rim can do is yeah get him out of there yeah I'm just I like I like that move I was hoping this would be a little easier before the basketball part I'm sweating already all right I'm going to get my pieces out too see guys I I I have a question I'm like a what they call a basketball casual right so to me basketball seems like like very vocal sport I mean besides the trash talk you got to communicate with your teammates and everything so why is chess so popular in the NBA it's a very quiet cerebral right activity like especially when you play on your phone like you play online so I'm curious what uh I mean for basketball it's kind of like one-on-one matchups too you know what I mean cuz when you got a defender in front of you I mean it's one-on-one determine like if I'mma go around you I'mma shoot it um get my teammate involved so same thing with chess it's like it's one-on-one and it's it's based upon your decisions off my decision you know what I mean so if I go right um and you cut me off now I got to think of a next move to give back to my left then M do like an in- and out with this it's like if I attack this way and you stop it I got to figure out a way to to Pivot to go this way and may I got to Pivot back and go you know what I mean so it's just kind of deception pretty much and Dan is like it's a competitive sport as well like nobody want to lose in chess like I hate losing so I feel like it's just the competitive aspect is it's kind of I feel like it's pretty unique too because I mean I played some basketball in the park growing up like you leave you're like man my teammates like miss the shots and play no defense but here it's like it's all you you got nobody else to blame you can't uh maybe not in this case but it's two on one I blame no I ain't going to let that happen hit hit me out hit me out you got to go like go to the hdle know like Queen to B3 I don't feel like that's a bad move you can do that but at the same time you can also move this to um any B4 for put him right here all right I'm going to make the same move but I'm going to take your knight okay Knight is too strong wait it don't mean NE we got to take it right away you know we got take him right away right we got to take him right away you you can talk him out of it I'll just move I'll just go back all right now now at least now now I can Castle now I can get to safety you can Castle two I say we might as well Castle though but we ain't got two yet unless you want to you feel like that's the move just cuz he did [Laughter] it oh man I feel like he kind of messed this up up L key put in the corner that we can exploit I don't know we might go um night to yeah five G I think we go here though so we both got the same idea for real put some pressure yeah if you take if you take my knight I can take then my King's a little yeah you feel me yeah all right all right all right here yeah we got to go back we got we got to play some defense two two on1 hold up wa I LIF in my hand all right now we good we good that's good defense that's good defense I like that and the words of Mark Jackson good defense better offense who move the back right here I say move him up now it's a double both of them is protecting him you feel me now he can still attack there oh but he got his Knight over there too though but we got double protection so even if he we do though you're not wrong all right let's see where this go in chess like the best players in the world they know that they're going to be really Elite by the time they're nine 10 like kids are becoming chess Grand Masters now which is even higher title than I have at like 12 13 which is crazy like they don't even go to school anymore they just like focus on chess so I guess in basketball when do you know I probably ain't really feel it till like my like sophomore my junior year of high school that's when I was kind of like I I feel like I really got a chance you know what I mean pertaining to like where everybody else was at in my class um my skill set compared to other people and just my mindset probably like my junior year going into yeah my junior year for sure I say my um I was like N I was like no I thought I was going to the league but not NBA thought I was going to the NFL yeah I was going to the like NFL but then like I was a football player too yeah when I Middle School I was down Middle School I was like no basketball lit so I say like when I got my first offer I was like 10th grade when you start growing like when were you like six started High School like like 6 to my my favorite thing is when chess players are really tall I always like to say they're tall for no reason like you're like 6'4 as a chess player I don't you should yeah straight up all right cuz you went here this was a good move cuz you stopped that threat but you stopped protecting this Pawn so yeah I'm gonna I'm going to have to take otherwise we going to be here all day and I start I know some I don't like when they just take when my piece get took and I ain't taking nothing back yeah we can get a we we could no no cuz I'm thinking about taking his his horse just cuz I'm mad yeah but if you take then I take I know does that happen in basketball too if you like mess up on one play you get you get mad you try to do something on the next play or you have to if you reach and you think you going to you feel me say today and next you know you can get a foul in one we ain't got to have him in a threat like that we can move him we ain't doing that we going to move him the little kids would call Touch move yeah in the tournaments oh you can't do that no no you could do whatever you want here but in the tournaments when you touch a piece you you have to move it a little kid yell at you I thought you was supposed to I thought you had to let it go you feel me that's okay you said right here right yeah all right I'll give um jump in there and give a check I had a feeling something like that was going to happen got to just take it right back oh yeah he probably didn't even see that he going he going to come in there he come I'm trading now we got to go here yeah we Castle right but now you you can't castle that way oh yeah you're right Bishop but I mean he's just going to run so yeah you might as well go right here yeah that's that was a deep breath huh I was thinking about something else n you good you good what are you thinking about you know sometimes in chess uh like you can't go to sleep if you made a really bad move cuz chess is the only sport you could go from completely winning to completely lost in one turn like in basketball it takes a quarter you know it takes like yeah turn of advance so sometimes I can't sleep at a chess tournament because I'm just thinking about a move you ever have a a day in basketball where one play or one bad decision you couldn't sleep because of it n 100% but Bas like kind of like you said this there multiple things I want to get him off white I ain't going to lie to you cuz he just going to keep you know what I mean yeah I feel that oh you good right there let's see if he going to change the little defense back there you want him to move one of these up just so he can [ __ ] your up type [ __ ] I'm going to I'm going to attack your knight he for short moved up we going to be right there I got a few moves but like it's going to take a minute I feel like I ain't going to lie hold on let me try something let want to see something real quick okay I like that move you feel me I we we ain't just yeah we playing offense we here here too we here too I like that I'm going I'm going to play What's called an in between move so in between taking your knight I'm going to take the Rook first how to feeling but now but now but now you're in check oh you're right so yeah that's why otherwise I I trying I got to get rid of the Knight yeah the crazy we got to take this though yeah we got to take this yeah that's a free that's a free uh that's food yeah you know what's funny it's like completely equal if you just look at the material Queen Rook Bishop six pawns it's totally equal so what he's saying is we Masters pretty much yeah we on his level but there was a butt cuz my king is a little safer than yours I can still start attacking stuff if you move right here he just going to take it no you're not he can't he got he going to take this one for sure but I mean we ain't got no other we a check we do we don't got no other options yeah I'm going to come down the best we can do is that's the best thing we can do unless yeah I don't see I don't see no counter moves no that's a good move for sure guys unfortunately no I don't say it I see it too I see it he about to go right here mm- you going to go I can take this for free and I can take that for free but because it's funny because our Bishops are on different colors yeah so you can't control a lot of these light squares what's funny is that if you went here to attack my queen this is not Checkmate cuz at least you can run away but I'm going to still try I'm going to eat like every Pawn cuz my queen has managed to get in but yeah if you go here then this is this is Checkmate cuz my Bishop is protecting and your your king is stuck that was a good game I know we're going to was close I want to I want to play again oh God I do but now we're I do too okay so game number one is over now it's time for basketball chess here are the rules DeAnthony and Paul and I will take 25 three-point shots five from five spots around the court we are going to take their average score out of 25 and then we are going to subtract my score and whatever that number is they are then going to take that amount of points away from me to start a chess game friendly reminder pawns are one night and Bishops are three Rooks are five Queen is nine so let's say they average 19 points out of 25 and I average zero cuz I miss every single shot that's 19 points they can take a queen and both my Rooks to start a chess game well let's see how I do in basketball chess someone keep track of how many he a hit around not one time yet oh yo chill man chill I told you I'm a shooter I told you let me where you at I'm going four four out of five right CH I don't four out of five right all right here we go you ready guys my leg kind of hurts you got your excuses broke my ankle the excuses are ready all right I didn't hear any excuses when they were playing chess hold on hold on what bro I'm I'm glad I got one cuz now I'm going to miss 24 y nobody saw that no saw there you go Daryl that was Daryl oh my God I'm just nervous oh man no no no I don't for oh all right Paul you're up yeah it was it was okay shorty I got more than Paul though shorty oh that's supposed to drop for sure you got it all right two's good shooter oh five again oh three five all right it's not going to help it's not going to help man I'm telling you it's not going to help R oh that wasn't bad that was close all right let's go oh good pass Daryl good pass trying to help you oh that's in though all right okay all right I'll take one all right Paul I just need one on every spot that's all I need oh no is that a spot oh noash let me tight up let me tight up layups Splash all right two oh Splash oh that's way off he trying to trick us man he I I always start well ohoo no no no no oh my bad my bad my bad sorry I don't want to that's not good I got I got more two two splash I thought he was going to go five for five again oh oh my god get up oh he's locked in damn great thanks that is a great pass oh my God that's four that's four right there one more oh do I have to call bank if if uh well the air balls are minus one I didn't tell you what oh nice Scot oh [ __ ] it 10 10day contract 10 day contct one more all right two two d man I'm 5'9 all I can do is three and D that's all I can do play good defense I'm like delova that's that's true oh all right lost none hey hey oh roll out I'm going to try ah damn Dam not that time oh that's way off oh no I ran out it ran ball another two-piece oh my God come on spash all right so four that's supposed to be five for five man he lose two so eight eight all right eight pieces I I got to keep my queen at eight points you can keep the take off so they averaged 16 I averaged eight and by average I mean I scored eight that was ridiculous I have never had a performance like that in my life 32% put me in for you know the like the Timberwolves or something I I don't know anyway point being they only got to take eight points from me so let's see what happens so this was eight points was the difference so now we have general manager of the Philadelphia 76ers who's going to okay eight points okay I think for sure you want to weaken his King remember last game you lost cuz your king was weak so you want this this is the most important to protect his position so you definitely want to take that that's one of your eight we at seven do you guys have a preference for what you might want to get rid of I think the Rook get rid of The Rook you think all right same side Rook or other side how many points is The Rook five five so that's five six yeah yeah so you got two pawns left the other thing think you could maybe do you could do two more pawns or yeah two more pawns trade a pawn night what would I do all right I'd probably I probably wouldn't do yeah I think I like taking one Rook I actually think that's good so just take out his defense here one more there just wipe out all his that's probably what I would do something like that Prett smart so now now you guys have now what I would suggest you guys are smart you'll get it it's a little quicker try and get your pieces out quick especially your your Knights and Bishops yeah and try to get at him quick before he can defend so all right good luck guys and that's the the darl myy 101 hand Lu guys it's like required come on all right go ahead got five minutes so this game maybe you can just alternate moves that's the oh man this is a terrible position I shot pretty well though you did you actually made more than I thought I thought I made more than I thought man I've uh I guess I got that you know clutch genan didn't want to lose all my come on man I got where's my pieces man got no pieces on the boardz I you still gotta be locked in I okay don't lose the queen though don't lose I was I was really worried he was going to make that move no no no we good we good we good just getting my hopes up okay uh um it's not bad like I really don't want to trade pieces but I can't move anything unless I trade pieces and that's completely fine with us yeah you guys are up eight okay I like that move I like that I don't like that all right I'm going to take this just go here yeah ah I managed to save save my king but I still got no pieces left uh oh yeah we going to do that oh okay okay okay we learned our lesson ah I don't know which one was better that one that one was for sure better now this game okay okay damn you know I uh I had a student who went to a chess tournament and his opponent didn't press the clock for 30 minutes so my student sat there pretending to think n yeah I was like I don't know if I like you winning like that but that's what I would have did that's the best win possible I mean straight up right like I you know I was like you know what if your opponent didn't know how to press the clock then it is what it is I'm mad that he like kind of still competing I'm using with what I have you know you going to do that you could take some it's getting there or you could take that n that's right there oh [ __ ] yeah yeah all right can't take my Bishop because of my Rook I got to go for your king we got to start developing pieces still don't have to what if there was a shot clock in chess you got to make a move in 20 seconds be crazy I'm going to bring all my pieces over just got to go got to attack the king man I'm going get him up out of here oh you you you you never pressed the clock so you can okay okay okay okay it's not tournament rules I like that I like that playing uh Street chess rules you can you didn't just press the clock and oh I was going to go here but then you would take so now I'm going to that's a good defense I'm slow I'm slowly making my way over but wait wait we got a remember he coming down here yeah and then they all attacking this piece right here so I I'm be honest and no but it also open up this one yeah we can't let him you want to save the king or The Rook though that is true they both going to get saved you're saving everybody how we going to save how we going to save everybody I'm catching up on the clock too that's man oh [ __ ] nice and relaxed now I can take no though see you hey you you could do your plan you wanted to save the I know that's s like at this point might we we kind of got to yeah yeah yeah I like that got to move up got to it's like more intense than the finals man at least we got we got them running now I feel like we can move huh yeah I'm just trying to make my way in somehow then we can move was going to do that though you can move this out but guys you got you have 30 seconds I know he P he pushing this though move this one bro all right with that one we got to run out of time he going to take it I'm about to lose it you know you don't have to take with a queen but it's a lot harder to make moves on a physical board than on the phone ah you got three seconds a [ __ ] I went on time but I was going to go here next and then it's I'm getting in against the king let me see I was going to play night there and then see that's what we should have we should have I should our started you should have been different it's the time a Time game so you could have just been you know playing hell of defense and make he would have ran out of time he's smart enough to like keep moving around no I I I was like yeah if you guys found a way to trade some of my pieces maybe but I was uh I was just being really annoying trying to attack over here that's what we should have did she just kept trading pieces but uh I would have I I I would have probably found a way in just because I he's smarter than he's smarter than people we probably play online and stuff like that you feel me so he going he going to still dance around I've also played chess 23 years so that was the collab I hope you enjoyed I had a great time shout out to the 76ers Organization for their amazing Hospitality shout out to DeAnthony uh shout out to Paul Reed really really had a special time and uh I've never made that many threes in my life I do not play basketball I play racket Sports and lift weights and try not to hurt my lower back also let me know if you enjoyed this kind of concept I I want to do more stuff like this with athletes with musicians with chefs with whoever I want to do more collabs where I exchange chess and they try to teach me something in return I think we can challenge one another I think we could do more stuff like this where uh somehow something I do in their world translates to you know to chess somehow anyway as always leave your feedback in the comments oh and if somehow YouTube recommended you this video and you're like a firsttime chess viewer uh shout out to you welcome to the Chess World I've got a lot of videos for beginners
