ladies and gentlemen how many of you have lost the chess game in seven moves don't answer that this is not supposed to be a therapy session how many of you have won a chess game in seven moves don't answer that either because it's probably the former is much more common than the latter well you might be 700 ELO 300 ELO a thousand fourteen hundred two thousand and so on but what if a grand master lost the chess game in seven moves ma must have been a bullet game Gotham one of your stupid clickbait titles must have been a rapid game I don't know somebody punched him he was drunk nope none of those things we are currently in the European Championship a very prestigious tournament that is held every year in Europe shocking right and a lot of the best players in Europe compete in it uh and uh it produces some incredible Champions and this was a game played in the early rounds between Ninjago from Azerbaijan and Sabino Brunello from Italy and what you are about to witness will shock you as this was a 90-minute game of chess between two very very good players began the game with the English opening the move C4 black responded with C6 oftentimes players with the black pieces that are intending to play uh various slav openings will play C6 and also you have to be prepared for white to suddenly play akaro Khan so you have to be ready for what's called A pseudopana variation with C4 because the regular pan out variation in the Karo Khan uh looks like this D4 and C4 with a capture so C4 C6 is already quite committal because black is basically saying I have no interest in putting my knight to C6 now you're probably salivating because if you think about the natural development of the game how did Black lose the game from this position in four moves black just played three of the seven moves what percent is that approximately 42-43 right um I think let's see three out of seven fourteen yeah around that right how did Black lose the game from here so black developed Bishop G4 and the idea could be to at times capture this Knight for instance if white plays I don't know it's actually kind of hard to come up with a move but let's just say on a very very simple level something like this okay damage structure isolated upon and black Black's actually very happy here because black is going to go here develop the knights Rock Solid so after Bishop to G4 white usually goes Bishop G2 or some form of Knight to E5 and in this game a boss of played Knight to E5 immediately targeting the bishop on G4 now there's a couple of places to put this bishop very natural Retreat is to do this and now it's kind of a London but this Knight is a little bit offside another very decent move according to chess theory is to play Bishop E6 it looks incredibly dumb but the idea of the move Bishop E6 is you're adding a level of pressure to this pawn and you always can play something like Knight D7 where white really doesn't want to make three night moves and just trade that just doesn't make any sense not to mention that then black can always do this too so sometimes the bishop will go to E6 but in this game it went to F5 now if I asked you to look around here by the way we're four out of seven moves on the way there how on Earth is black gonna lose this game is what right how now this just doesn't make any sense what well uh in this position white plays the move Queen B3 okay Queen B3 makes sense and I just want to point something out black spends six minutes on this move that is not a good sign it's not a good sign because if you're gonna commit to this you've got to have an answer to the move Knight E5 right I mean you you have to know the theory so Bishop F5 I'm not coaching Brunello he's a much better player than I am but I'm just saying like six minutes on move four when you play Bishop G4 you have to be ready for 95 right so Bishop of five and now Queen B3 and and now now we have another situation here where black is under some pressure when black made this whole plan to move the light squared Bishop the pawn on B7 is weak it's not losing black can defend it like this black can defend it like this and black can also do this and the move Queen B6 is a very very legitimate move the idea is that if white trades black is very happy with the opening of the a file and is actually already threatening to win material with Bishop Bishop B1 Rook B1 and actually Rook A2 which is kind of hilarious so the Queens see each other however when the queen goes to B6 it completely removes its eye off of D5 uh and in this position white intends to make you know to take advantage of that there also is this very fascinating idea Queen to F3 uh which attacks the bishop and if the bishop goes here obviously Queen F7 but if this then there's Bishop H3 so just like a completely completely wild line where uh black can very quickly get a completely lost position and that's not what happened but I'm just telling you those are the possibilities it's very tricky when this queen comes out with that Knight that's under Fire this is an idea that's under Fire black plays Queen B6 and now white takes on D5 okay so far so good right so very simple and right off the bat if black does this white does this and is a pawn up black does not want that so before black takes the pawn black has to take the queen folks we have now made six moves for black how is black gonna lose the game this is the move this is move seven black to play and loose wow that's very easy uh Bishop here lose the bishop okay black to play and not make a move that's stupid uh uh f 6 okay not a bad guess not bad but how's black gonna lose I don't understand well in the game black played Bishop E4 Bishop E4 how does that lose the game it loses the game because Black's entire idea was obviously The Rook is under attack so was the pawn and he probably thought white will go here and I will take and Life Will Go On but after Bishop to E4 ninja boss have played the following move Pawn takes C6 what oh I get it if Bishop takes I take in the Ruckus trap nope because if this this huh then what's the winning move oh it's obvious C7 no because the Knight just moves and you can't queen wait a minute so why is Bishop E4 Pawn takes C6 Bishop takes H1 losing it's losing because in this position white can sacrifice The Rock Rook takes oh my God and the idea is that the Rook now is tray it has no choice it has to take on A7 and then the pawn is guaranteed a promotion and you win the game you make a queen and it's oh my God oh my God oh my God Rook takes A7 oh my God what a trap Bishop E4 Pawn takes and if black does this Rook a seven is incredible now of course black can you know just lose other pieces in the following way and just be dead lost but D takes C6 now you will notice according to stockfish it's only losing if black takes the Rook it's only plus nine if black takes the Rook but black lost the game in seven moves that's crazy Rook takes A7 is one of the most unbelievable traps I have ever seen Pawn takes Rook A7 C7 and you can't stop promotion so instead of going down that way black decided to do this here's the problem uh it's now move eight and black is down one Pawn not only is black down one Pawn he has to live with a 20 minute time disadvantage and the psychological damage of blundering so early that that is a very real thing making a mistake that early in the game he's now got to defend this position where uh he is clearly clearly clearly in trouble and white plays this move F3 now and if you take the Knight I'm just gonna go here and then I will do this do this do this do this and you're dead lost so instead of that black tries to play Knight D4 to try to get into C2 now you may ask yourself oh wait none of that happened well no because a grand master saw that right so look at the time spent right he spent 10 minutes because he realized Rook A7 is he he had he had 71 minutes to figure out that Rook A7 was the Trap which he did and then he didn't fall for it that that is of course commendable but he's already losing and now white plays Rook A4 which is even more spectacular uh and uh Bishop takes B1 Rook takes D4 what even is this position I mean this is one of the most ridiculous games I've ever seen and uh black plays F6 the the what what is what is the bishop on B1 doing the thing is according to the computer black can actually still hold this point two is a very uh bold recommendation I mean it's like 0.6.7 probably but um once you blunder what he blundered in the opening I'm not sure you can bounce back Bishop E4 D takes C6 is a crazy idea absolutely I mean oh my God oh my God what an idea and when we got down finally to this position E5 Rook C4 um black was still under severe pressure uh this Rook is uh this bishop is trapped if you take to try to get out I'm not worried about having damage pawns because I'm just gonna go D4 next I'm gonna crack that open get my Bishop out legally get my Bishop out legally get my king and Rook out and uh at the Grand Master Level this is a completely lost position uh but this game ended uh in emphatic fashion black played the move Bishop to D6 and white did not touch the king did not touch you know can't even really move the bishop play the move Knight C5 so targeting this Pawn on B7 um and it goes from bad to worse here like if you play Rook B8 I'm gonna go here get my Bishop out get my Bishop out so black decides to play B5 and uh White slides back Knight develops now E4 controls the development of the Knight on E7 and uh look how much time black has spent on the game we go from 40 minutes down to six because the position is so dreary he lashes out with B4 The Rook slides up and now here comes Pawn to D4 this bishop is just completely stuck I mean it made it down there and there was no way home we have Pawn takes and now Bishop F4 takes takes and black resigned down 43 minutes on the clock and with a bishop in prison have you ever seen a chess piece in prison the bishop made it to the opposite side of the board and cannot Escape anywhere it goes here someone can take it and if it goes to A2 it can't take the pawn ever because then I don't see five protects it White's next move is literally Rook to C1 and if it's not Rook to C1 it's going to be sliding the king and Bishop out of the way and then taking the Rook using the Rook to take the bishop like that black just resigned he has nothing if he tries to fight back with Knight G6 white takes if you try to take on F4 I will move my Bishop out I will move my kid your Bishop is still completely stuck what even was this game the average rating of this game is like 2570. this is crazy right this all came from a very off-beat uh 95 kind of system which is like very you know very very tricky system Queen B3 coming out early and black could have been solid you know could have could have played a little bit more close to home but then this is one of the nastiest traps I mean oh my God Bishop takes H1 not taking because then this not pushing because then the Knight moves Rook takes a seven good God Take a Bow I mean what really what can you do and black just could not fight back I mean it was like flatlined he tried his best but the position was tough and a very nice win over a boss of and uh tough one tough one uh tough one for Brunello but I mean obviously he's uh he's a very very good player and these things happen these things happen in sport these things happen in chess so that's how you can beat a grand master in seven moves or losing seven moves depending on if you're a pessimist or an optimist uh who knows maybe maybe some of you can go try this in your own games you know do this if they play Bishop G4 hit him with a little 95 Queen B3 uh but uh yeah what a game indeed I'll see you in the next video get out of here
