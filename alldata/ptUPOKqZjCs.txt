ladies and gentlemen welcome to episode 4 of Elo swap you stole my intro welcome back to episode 4 of Elo swap which is a series where if you know you know which is where a low rated player uh plays a chess game against the higher rated player uh for a little bit and it gets themselves into a little bit of trouble and then the higher rated player in this case me will take over and show how to defend the position fight back and so on um my guest for this series is now exclusively Lucy AKA Gotham wife AKA around 1100 rapid strength 800 Blitz strength in episode 3 which we incorrectly called episode 2 because we forgot I recorded an episode with Northern lion sorry Northern lion it's been a long time he's in the same league as your wife now yes yes I don't yes you know not I don't love him as much but um yeah anyway we'll we'll address all of that later um in today's episode uh Lucy is going to play a 14 1500 rated rapid player she's rated around a Thousand Eleven Hundred rapid and she's gonna do her best she's gonna commentate her thought process and at some point if she gets a bad position I will take over and I will show how to defend or convert or whatever it might be um all of the players in these videos know that they're going through this process uh don't account share with people who are 1500 points higher rated than you that is not allowed all these games are unrated we have permission and this is for instructional purposes um yeah account sharing is frowned upon don't do it unless you're a YouTuber because rules don't apply to us so any thoughts before we send you off to your game no I'm excited to win another game all right terrific I'll play your first move for you how did you know because that's what you play and you know what if I'm in a bad position it's because you played that move okay assistant relax relax it's good everything is good you're not Northern lion but you know what opening you're playing against haricon yes yes it's your favorite opening it's my favorite opening uh I push wow do we've ever hit hit the like button I just want to make sure that everything looks good everything looks great everything looks great because you're on camera that's very cute playing C5 C5 very powerful move I'm not scared Pawn chain now keep in mind yes oh the audience oh you're like at your absolute Peak around 1100 rapid right um I don't want to distract you yeah um at least you're making me lose you have nine minutes so take your time explain your thought process my absolute Peak in Rapid was a thousand oh I crossed a thousand and promptly went down to 700. okay talk about the position uh you know it's muscle memory really I've just played this so many times I just know what's going on um this is still very much in my prep um how about you um okay okay I'm gonna kick the bishop out okay oh I couldn't tell if that was serious I felt like all these battles you had at a thousand went exactly like this you know it it goes something like this okay um I would like to activate my night or my bishop and I'm leaning towards my night seems reasonable seems very logical I also don't like that his Queen is here okay so does it have any threats not at the moment so this is what I'm gonna do I want to set up this this and this in order to kick his night I mean not not night Queen how um there might be other more pressing things to do but I'm gonna do this okay okay okay I don't see I don't see a better alternative okay what do you think about that move by him I think I can just take back yeah he took my knight okay okay all right you think it was a good trade by him I think it was a pretty good trade okay because it allowed me to bring my queen out and and I like not Bishops more than nice anyway it was a good trade for you or him me right that was a good trip for him no I don't care about him something about myself okay okay uh um oh very tricky very tricky this now is free [Music] spend with my rock okay yes yes I thought about defending with my Bishop but he could just take my Bishop okay and it'll be another trade okay um I don't know I don't think much when playing with white because I just assume I'm better but he now cannot Castle this way because that would be very silly to expose your king like that okay so he's probably gonna Castle short side probably gonna Castle the other way okay so it's probably in my best interest to like break this up a little bit maybe next move I will be moving my Bishop out baiting him into attacking it yes he almost poke me in the eye I know I'm sorry now he's spooked wait but why am I so low on time you have seven minutes that's very low comparatively speaking okay what does that move do if anything absolutely nothing all right but I think he was anticipating me uh attacking his Queen this way okay so I will not be doing that okay me oh this is very annoying I don't want to move my pawns out to kick his night out it's incredibly annoying let me do this that also doesn't serve a purpose piano just for fun just for fun because I don't know what else to play and I'm my I'm now down two minutes yeah what'd you think of that move I can't tell you until I swap in I'm just a spectator okay tell me telepathically yes um yeah well you know I what oh no it's very sad okay now I did not see that coming correct that's how chess normally goes okay I can attack his Queen because equal or exceeding Danger and then I don't know if he take I take no I can't because I'll be in check so I just have to take the L and take the pawn and then let go of my Pawn okay okay okay okay okay okay now's a matter of where should I move my queen I'll just I'll do it right here yeah which which was Square because I was like oh if I go here I'm pinning him what whatever I'll go here safest all right took a minute to find that move you had an idea it didn't work and that was good you found why it doesn't work it's how chess works that was that was well done you missed that his queen move attacked your Center Pawn 1500 you know he's pretty good literally rapid is really not bad he's fine okay he's fine oh keep in mind this is rapid so if I'm gonna swap in for you um I'm gonna need a bit more time like okay there's no bonus time all right all right no problem I hear you what does this do this card go here I could go here is he trying to reroute [Music] it's not that bad what's this trying to do then [Music] well you could spend five minutes staring at it yeah yeah yeah yeah what does your move do just trying to protect my Pawn okay just in case the Knight eats it yeah yeah I thought it was lonely um I see I functioned a little bit after he took your Center Pawn I did it was so surprising that it just threw me off completely it's just the fun okay does that move have an idea that move has an idea because this Pawn is now being doubly attacked and what I would like to do okay is defend it yes with my queen or my no I'm gonna go here oh foreign s yeah you're in focus focus focus okay that means there's a bad move yeah what's going on right now uh I am down material like I was last game this is a this is an um you're in chat I know oh where should you move your king here here so it's safer here so it's safer but he can track me again oh that was correct he said he could check you again so that means you're not safe yeah so here of course what happened this game you feel like you just lost all your confidence I feel like you were like a beast because we recorded back-to-back games I feel like he took one of your pawns and you were just like malfunctioned yeah that's okay it's two point who cares it's too bad I'm gonna swap in right now yes no play one more move play one yeah okay all right Play One More move trust yourself but you gotta play fast because three minutes is not okay my turn yes okay please have fun in this game what happened that's just how chess works you know you play one game you feel good about it and then you just you the bed oops that's okay the the eight-year-old watching was with his dad is gonna what does that mean you're gonna poop your diaper and um um and if anybody's just watching this video and is confused we recorded two ELO swap episodes in one sitting you know and last game you played a really nice game and I feel like this game you got a bit stressed yes you have this this is what you wanted to play yes yeah I'm gonna play it this is your idea for a while what's the only way he can play a queen move and defend the bishop safely uh right there yeah now I wanna trade I also want to go I'm sorry I don't want to trade because I'm down material I'd like to go here but he can take so I'm gonna go here which defends my knight and attacks the bishop again okay and I can take the pawn so the only way I'm going to be able to make a comeback in this game is to protect my king who's feeling a bit Airy right because of the dark squares but still it was safer than putting the king there which you found you're so unconfident but you were finding completely normal moves it's just what happens like you get like bummed and then you um and I know you as a chess player I also know myself as a chess player same problems yes same problem different ELO it's you know it's the same thing so I guard this I pressure this I might take this Pawn I also you know what else I might do I might take this moment to just go attack the king like I'm losing right so one of the only ways to fight back in chess is to like start an attack on the king um I I don't know I mean taking this it's really hard to not take a free Pawn but is my queen trapped look at this like my queen might get trapped sometimes I think you'll find it though you can't play Shots like that okay you can't play chess like he's not gonna find it like you always assume that it was fine the best yes yes yes you have to so I think I'm just gonna the way I'm gonna play this is I'm gonna bring my Rooks over here and start an attack on the king I don't think I have anything else the locked center benefits me because it prevents him from putting out pieces but yeah I mean two pawns down is two pawns down ultimately and I'm down two minutes I'm gonna try my best though if he beats us maybe he also has a 2700 Blitz player or something yeah he did the he swapped the ELO in Elo swab all right so I don't like this move why what would you not like about this move what's wrong with it it's a concept it's not a concrete reason I don't have like a fork he moved away from his King and see this is cheese like he's trying to win by like oh maybe he won't see it right but now I now I have this now he probably has to go back which is really yeah which is oh he can't push that pawn he could but he might open his position which I don't know if he's comfortable doing right there you go um now I don't have a quick response unfortunately like I don't have an immediate so I'm just gonna take a little space I'm gonna prevent his pieces from moving forward and we have to catch up on time very important um there is also a trap that we can set here oh no I blundered my Pawn now my Rook is not defending this anymore but if he takes that I go here and suddenly The Rook is attacking his Queen right and I'm hitting this which is a it's a tactical mistake he might fall for it this is probably the best move hopefully he doesn't play that what might happen is this this and then he's like oh idiot takes the pawn and falls for this anyway right because his Queen's hanging and he goes oh Free Pawn but what I'm really trying to do here is go here you're catching up on time yes which is important it's part of the game like time is absolutely part of the game if you're defending this position and you're down three minutes you're gonna lose you have to force yourself to play faster we also have to remember this constantly has an eye on our Rook didn't I just say that was gonna happen wait a minute he might be a genius because if Knight takes then this that's attacking my queen did he see that see a genius I think I have to test it out I think he'll get a spooked and move his Queen we're gonna have a little bonus question if he takes should I take his Queen first or should I take his Rook first should I take his Rook or his queen queen I mean Rook Rook why because because um I'm gonna get his Queen anyway right this is called a Desperado okay so I was gonna lose my queen anyway so I sacrificed it because now I win this and The Rook I want a rook now I win a queen for free now we're back in the game yes now we're threatening this Pawn from two different angles he might have to go here again we've been really really abusing this uh this Rook to go back and forth like this he's probably still doing completely fine by the way oh he wants this Pawn okay oh man this is a very stressful position I'm gonna take I didn't want to expose my back rank now I go here he might plunder mate Rook guards Pawn Rook hangs mate that would be very funny that'd be very funny I don't know if it's gonna happen the only way I can win this now is in the end game meaning I take a pawn and then wow Rook behind Pawn is a great move oh man that's annoying all right I have to stop this like this you have to get on an opposite color square of the piece because if you get on the same color Square he's going to be able to kick you out he can't kick me out right now okay let's bring the king I want to do my best I don't know if I can win this this is very very difficult to win but I'm trying to bring my king because you have to win the end game um he's doing a really good job though all right Rook here we're gonna try to give side checks I'm gonna try to give some side checks here if he goes here I can't guard my king because he with my king because he'll check me so I I don't know what I have to do here I might need to just go here but now he's getting he's getting his King in and his Pawn doing my best and he's gonna yeah wow he might just be better in this end game he's playing really well okay that I that move I welcome because now his King is cut off he might struggle to get closer right okay but this is still a very stressful position okay now I'm closer to the pawn I'm closer to the pawn he defends it that way uh maybe we can deflect the we're going to deflect the bishop away to try to win this Pawn that's one of our only hopes of winning this game he should have okay and he he does it oh that's that's huge for us that's huge for us so it looks pretty bad it's bad but it was worse before I see um now the only chance we have of like oh can I sack The Rook take take King F5 King C6 King F6 King D7 King G6 or King D5 King G6 oh I think we might be winning oh I was gonna say the exact same thing I'm glad you found it I think and we're gonna win the race and this is a winning King and pod end game this is winning this is so crazy wow that was pretty cool wow wow that was pretty cool wow just in time and we're gonna make the queen this is why ELO swap is great he was so close he played really well now let's just cut him off night opposition when he goes to the yeah let's just copycat copycat is the easiest and then you bring your keys yes we'll bring our King we're just gonna copy one and the second we have a chance to get him on the last row roller rank or does it not matter like as long as he gets to the outskirts of the board like there just cut him off and just easy we can pre-move the rest because this King can't go anywhere now and this is actually mate that's also made that was wow there's a lot to analyze there okay okay so first of all your opening was fine yes you didn't like again the difference between a thousand and 1500 is he knows the opening really well he's undermining your Center and you played here and he probably has my course like literally no joke so he played Queen A5 which is the best move into this yeah here already he can like start preventing you from castling um but this was fine you did completely fine in the opening and Bishop takes F3 was a was not a good move like okay it was a fine move okay according to the computer but I don't think you you really you know this is all okay um this is actually probably completely fine maybe I wouldn't have rushed it but now here he started in my opinion doing a little bit of of weird stuff like I don't think he should have retreated the queen I think he probably should have played here in castled you just didn't see this which is the difference between 1500 and a thousand and I got completely spooked after this yes but it's just Queen here and then your plan can continue and so you lost this Pawn you correctly calculated all of this right um and then you were very disturbed by this move you were like what is it doing but it's not doing anything you just look around and you go can the Knight go to any of these squares but you can't go here that's what you have to realize like the Knight covers that after you played it yes yes but I it was an immediate response played it and I was like no yes that's that's what always happens like you you go here again like around here you kind of lost the thread I mean you you have to just be like okay I'm down a pawn what have I not moved yet Rook C1 you were sort of like a like a little bit all over the place you're like I don't know what to do like do I you know do I attack in general it's like checks captures attacks none of that works here you I mean you have to evaluate if Knight A4 is worth doing or not very hard to decide because it's a safe move but um let's just say you don't even see that like just move a piece you haven't moved yet yeah Rook C1 or B4 takes some space um and then here you were like I want to defend this with my Rook or my queen which is absolutely right right and then all of a sudden the intrusive thoughts won and then you were like wait why did I do that now he does this and uh you know and King H1 and uh and he castled and rookie won and and he went back and and here yeah we were kind of on our own like there was uh you know uh we were kind of on our own I I did my best uh I defended but he he played a really high quality game of chess uh uh like Rook F3 and Rook have fade and all of these moves I keep saying I keep saying he could be anybody it's uh flaw of chess players that we just assume our opponents are male Knight takes D5 here Queen takes A3 was not necessary the best move was to open up like this I basically just kept as much tension in the position as possible looking for opportunities over here if opponent had played something like this I probably would have like it's it's completely lost okay but I would have tried to you know go over here and then and then just just try something desperately try to attack and and maybe it would work like maybe I'd play Rook G3 and we would you know but that would hang a rook so I was just trying to catch up on time and play as tens of a position as possible I had to find this move which was instructive Queen takes and then to this but even then black was completely fine yeah um this was a good move and then Bishop F6 was fine and yeah opponent did a really nice job keeping the tension one last instructive thing that they did here which was wrong here they should have used the bishop as a shield they should have tried to get as close to the pawn as possible so they should have gone here and I think if they played that move we were on the verge of loss because their king would safely arrive there and this just looks pretty miserable for white like it just looks like he's going here but he went the wrong way say I keep doing it he but uh bladesy went that way and I was like all right let's deflect and even here it's probably still equal-ish but the reason why this is probably winning for white is that yeah you see the eval it's because the king is cut off he King can go anywhere and in this position we can sack the rook and we win which was tough like you have to be good at converting into end games like this we did it this was fun did you enjoy I feel like you I feel like you did not you enjoyed the comeback I feel like you did not enjoy the level difference of the opening I enjoyed the last episode because I think I was I didn't know the opening so I was just doing whatever and it felt fine but this this person knew what they were doing in the opening and it spooked me a little bit it's okay ELO swap success once again once again do you have a 100 win rate in Elo swab yes no maybe oh wow you were nervous your hands are a little clammy maybe I'm just sweaty because it's hot in here yeah maybe I'm sitting next to a very cute girl no I'm very nervous okay on that note on that note uh we will uh you stole my intro so you can steal my outro too we'll see you in episode five now what do I say at the end of my videos do you forget get out of here there you go
