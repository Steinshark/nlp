so hello everybody i am with richard rowland who at this point doesn't need any introduction and we're really excited to go into our second part of the the grail symbolism we did the last video with a really great reaction and so uh richard take it away let's start us off this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world [Music] [Applause] so yeah a lot of people really liked the last video we also got a little bit of just a small amount of controversy that was sparked by the last video as well which is always exciting to see um and i want to reiterate that one of the reasons actually i recorded an a podcast episode about this uh with somebody recently and then we got to the end we realized that neither of us had hit the record button oh no so now there's just a lost conversation out there and it was when i was over the guy that i was recording with he's a priest he was really uh really upbeat about it and really you know it's just like listen if this conversation isn't good enough for us to enjoy then there's no point in doing it so don't feel bad about it now we have a cool lost episode but anyway um more about that maybe in the future but uh one of the things we were talking about is is one of the reasons that i'm so interested in the arthurian stories in the grail particularly but in really all the arthurian stuff i mean i've got entire bookshelf over here just mostly arthurian stuff uh two or three shelves um is because i think that the arthurian uh i don't know you want to call it a mythos or a cycle or because you know it's like it's like it's like a group of legends there's no canonical you know definitive this is the authoritative arthur but it it kind of contains within itself everything that's good and noble but also everything that's a problem about being a western person right and i really want to say that both the good and the bad are in there um i hope that you know as we're doing these great videos um i'm i'm i mean i'm a western person you know i'm not anti-western i'm just trying to sort of deal with where i am in in the world and in history and i i found the grey of legends to be really helpful to do what was the controversy i don't even know i there were some people some people were like oh well you're just you're just saying you know all these you know things the west is terrible blah blah blah you know because we got into the end you know there's there's there's this whole school of thought this whole school of thought of uh um which i tend to agree with that that traces the origins of the grail legend to um the fourth crusade and the holy mackerel and the shroud of turin and all this stuff right um so obviously that stuff is uh it's a little still a little historically painful if it wasn't historically painful uh the pope wouldn't have apologized for it you know this last week i think he's making a tour of like crete and other places um so it's still very historically painful for a lot of people and uh my point in bringing that stuff up is not to like make a thing out of it it's just to say historically if that stuff didn't happen we wouldn't get the grail story right like the one thing all the stuff flows out of this sense of ruptured communion and of course also these debates about communion itself which kind of manifest in the west right around the time that the grail legends kind of become a thing okay yeah yeah so i just you know just want to kind of put that out there um um when i'm talking about the stuff it's it's because i really do deeply love it um especially especially the story we're going to talk about today which is a christian's um story of the grail um and there's got a french title which i'm not going to try to embarrass myself to a native french speaker uh by saying but um but anyway so it's it's the story of the grail and um it is the first grail romance so before this there are no holy grail stories as such and i would just want to point out that this grail story is not exactly the version that people remember because the version that people remember has like these indiana jones and monty python layers on it but ultimately it goes back to for english speaking people usually goes back the to sir thomas mallory's lemore d'arthur which has basically the the the the final form of the french version of the story which is like the like the french the lancelot grail vulgate cycle that that that's what mallory is working from so that's what most of us actually know this comes a long time before that it's the first ever grail romance and i think it's also in many ways the most symbolically insightful but i just want to point out that this story is a really beautiful story it's weird it's rich it's wonderful so don't just like sit down and read this to like strip mine it for symbolic content or something like that um because there's always a danger for people like us to do that but this is i mean the story just the beginning of the story just the first three or four pages i'm going to be reading today out of this edition by the way this is the complete romances of kreti and it's translated by david stains i think is how you say his name you can find this on amazon it's a pretty good translation one of the things i like about it is the fact that it's a prose translation which i'm not generally a big fan of doing although i have done some of these myself i'm not generally a big fan of doing verse to verse translations from other languages um because it's just very difficult to pull off the effect of the normal verse and so in that case i what i would rather have is like a really good prose translation that would then support my attempts to go back and and kind of wrestle with the poetry in the original language so anyway this is a good this is a good translation and um i just want to say that the uh my interest in the grail legends and the grail stories actually begins with uh sort of an encounter in the liturgy that i had um and it was this beautiful uh 6 a.m divine liturgy um there's a greek church near my house and one one year during the nativity fest in fact we're just a couple of days as we're recording this the day after like the two or three year anniversary of when this happened okay um the day after the uh uh it was it was a 6am liturgy for saint nicholas so that was yesterday you know for us and um we i was i was in the church and it was this you know it's this beautiful sort of basilica basilica-style church it's one of the best churches in in the north texas area it's totally dark um just lit by candles and there was like one chanter it's just really really good uh byzantine chanter and um it was just him and maybe one or two other people with him and they were doing the whole service and it was during the terubikim and uh you see the you see the um you know they're coming up the center of the church with the with the gifts and as they're doing this you know i see here's the altar server bearing the taper and the deacon with a patent and the priest with the chalice and everything is dark and there's light and there's lights and incidents and everything and i just sort of had this flashback to reading this romance and just this realization it's like this is i'm in the grail chapel right now like what what is happening and some other things that some other pretty incredible things happened later that morning but uh for me that was the moment that kind of tied it all together a moment of intuition during the liturgy and then that's kind of that's kind of what all of this came out of so um there was a english occultist named a.e waite who wrote a uh wrote a book called i think it's called the high history of the holy grail and it's pretty interesting um actually i think it's called the holy grail history legend and symbolism but maybe maybe you also wrote a book called the high history of the holy grail anyway um uh wait is an occultist he's a you know theosophist i don't really recommend anybody go and read his stuff i think he's sketchy as heck but um uh but he was part of this group of people in england um and most of them were like sort of you could say disaffected anglicans yeah sort of felt like the uh the mystical aspects of christianity were missing from their church and this is all tied up with the whole movement of celtic romanticism yeah right which is to say you know it's this is it's tied up with nationalism chelsea romanticism basically celtic romanticism is the idea that celtic people as a race okay and i put that in scare quotes as a race are uh they're like more naturally intuitive and spiritual and wild and free and yeah all this stuff it's like you know like enya's first album basically and and um oh it's hilarious man yeah um um i actually it was also like it was a nationalist moment in revenge of the whole like of the the anglo-saxon yeah it was like it was like a thousand years too late but it was like this sort of like revenge for the the anglo-saxon invasion where he had all of these anglo-saxons you know suddenly saying well we got to get back to our celtic roots right yeah um and so that's that's what a lot of this was tied up with and so one of the things that people started trying to search for and there's still people who are hung up on this today is this idea of like reconstructing or finding like this this lost celtic liturgy yeah this idea that there would be a celtic expression of christianity that would be authentic to the british isles in a way that latin right roman catholicism and then also anglican aglicanism as something that developed out of that yeah um that it would be authentic in a way that those weren't yeah um and so these guys looked back to the grails story and they looked at it and they said oh look it's so liturgical it's there's chalices and you know it's the body and blood of christ all this stuff it's which is so liturgical this must this legend must actually be about the true celtic lost celtic liturgy and all of these stupid continental romances turn it into this adventure story and they got it totally wrong so a lot of you guys hated the romances because and what i would like to say is these guys are but that's interesting that it's interesting that they would see they would see the grail legend as a nostalgia for the lost celtic christianity in general like that that when the the anglo-saxons brought in the latin mass and kind of imposed rome uh on the the let's say on the british isles then that would have been like they would have lost something and that would be a memory of that in the in the king arthur because king arthur is from before that time like obviously right and yeah that's that whole thing is a is a complicated question and i'm actually working on putting a new podcast together for ancient faith which will hopefully be all about the history of the english conversion um but i haven't had another podcast are you sorry i haven't had time to work on it this fall but i'm hoping that maybe january february that'll drop so keep an eye out for that um and if you if you like because because that whole question of conversion uh the conversion of the anglo-saxon peoples is really interesting to me but basically i think these guys are in they have the right intuition but they totally misread the mystery the romances because in some senses they're blinded a little bit by this sort of you know this celtic romanticism right so what i want to basically uh try to demonstrate in by by doing a close reading of christian's romance is two things one is that this structure of the story itself or at least those parts the story is really has two parts that are uh they're connected by a medieval technique called interlace which is basically where you have threads of two stories that move in and out of each other at multiple points this is very common in arthurian stories which is why if you've ever sat down and you've just tried to read an arthurian story and you're like oh it's christmas and we're at the court and then a little white dog runs in and he's followed by like three stags and a princess who's weeping and then some guy goes to deal with that problem and on the way he gets challenged and then we learn about this night that and it's like it's like why can't we just stick with one plot thread right but it's it's because these these plot threads are are interlaced so they kind of weave in and out of each other and you just have to sort of like set aside your modern three-act narrative expectations and kind of just hang on so this story has basically two threads like that one is about percival and the other is about uh gawain um but at least the percival part of the story is fundamentally structured according to the pattern of the divine liturgy and i think this is absolutely indisputable the second thing that i want to try to prove is that everyone has been reading this story in completely the wrong way or at least everyone has been everyone everyone i'm the first one to get it right jonathan you guys heard it here now let me let me let me i'll nuance that a little bit i like to say that provocatively because it gets people's attention but um everyone believes that the story is unfinished and that percival never finds the grail and everyone in the middle ages believe that which is why i have a book right here if i can if i can if i can pick it up without knocking down all of the other books stacked on top of it i have a book right here that has all of the medieval continuations of the personal romance so everybody was unsatisfied with the way that the story doesn't end and uh and they try to write their own continuations of it right but what i want to argue is that if you read the text closely you'll see that percival actually does succeed he actually does achieve the grail so so let's talk a little bit about the story so percival we don't actually learn his name until about halfway through the poem um in fact he doesn't learn his name until about halfway through the poem first of all begins totally without identity he only knows himself in relation to his mother and so when he's first asked what's your name somebody asked him what's your name he says well my name is dear son because that's what his mother calls him and or in relation to his to the to his servants who call him dear masters he was like it's like well what's your other name well my other name is dear master right uh he doesn't know himself though in relation to his father so this is a very important detail in personal story his father is a knight who died in battle due to a grave injury to the loins okay um and the reason that his mother will not tell him who he is won't tell him his name or who his father was is because she doesn't want him to become a knight she doesn't want him to grow up and die the same way that her fa that his father did so so the other hint that we get about percival's uh identity is his clothing so clothing that putting on and taking off of garments and often we're told that they're garments of coarse hair regardless of skins in this story like very literally explicitly um that's very important to pay attention to as you read this this romance not just with percival i'm going to give some examples of that but also with the other the like the side characters as well um we're told when he's his clothing is first described we are told that he dresses like a welshman which is not a compliment as far as christian is concerned um the idea is he's sort of like dressed in like butt uh you know like buskins like you know um you know he looks looks like a rustic right yeah he's rustic um and by his activities so his his his hobby um the thing that he likes to do is he has this javelin and then he and it talks and spends a whole lot of time about talking about him like he's walking along he's throwing the javelin north south east and west towards every point of the compass and the idea i think here is that his identity is scattered and it's focused right now i i said and i gave reasons for this in our previous video but i said that essentially this uh this this poem follows the structure of the divine liturgy and you could say wouldn't that also make sense if you're saying that his identity is scattered or that it's yeah that that's would also the idea of his father dying from an injury in the loins would definitely go with that yes right yeah those two things are really really closely connected yeah so and i think that the you could say the liturgical structure of this poem you could chalk it up to two things one is there does seem to be lots and lots and lots of evidence that the grail legends uh developed at least partially out of byzantine liturgic liturgical commentaries like that of saint germain so i mean that's so there's an explicit connection there but also i believe and i think that you believe that the liturgy is the shape of everything right so whether or not you can demonstrate that christiane ever spoke to somebody who's seen a byzantine divine liturgy although he almost certainly had because obvious patrons were these crusader families um but whether or not he'd actually seen like an eastern right divine liturgy or or read that kind of kind of a commentary i think because this the structure of the story is so fundamentally symbolic and cosmic that it's it's uh it's unavoidable so if we wanted to sort of look at this through the lens of liturgy we can see this um different liturgical commentators talk about the way that we are before we come together for the synopsis before we come together for the gathering right which is not just a gathering of us as as a people as a like a congregation but it's also a gathering of our scattered identity we've been out in the world we've been pulled this way by this thing and that way by that thing and we're just all we're all scattered and dissolute and all of these things being pulled together when we decide we're going to enter into the church and so what we see is that at each part of the story percival has these changes that come up uh come with a movement up the you could say like a movement up the ontological hierarchy right so everything's a mountain right or a tree right so as he moves up to each level he has to change clothing he has to be given a set of instructions for how to behave himself on the next level and then what we see happening in the story is him doing or not doing that well depending on the case so in this case he begins with a totally scattered loss of identity and then he's off in the forest he's playing with his javelin he's doing all this stuff and suddenly he hears some knights riding through the bushes like in the forest right and he's in the forest sauvage so the the savage forest the wasteland the wild forest the wild forest and um as he hears the knights coming he actually thinks that they're demons because of the sound they're making it's it's a big scary sound he's never heard anything like this and this is actually where we find out how much chretien or how much percival knows about god which is really important because he doesn't know much he's been taught the creed he's been taught the our father and he's been taught that he's supposed to make the sign of the cross when he hears something coming or when something scares him to frighten the demons away but he says i'm not going to make the sign of the cross instead i'm going to wait here and when the demons appear i'm going to strike them with my javelin and kill them so that's his his attitude and when he sees the knights come through he sees them and he immediately changes his mind he says i have sinned grievously uh to call them devils because my mother told me no idol tell when she said to me that angels were the most beautiful creatures there are except god who is the most beautiful of all here i behold the lord god i believe for one of them is so beautiful that the others so help me god have not attempted this beauty so he thinks he sees the most beautiful night and the other night's with me thinks i must be seeing god and his angels so he's very confused he doesn't know what he's dealing with and basically the knights set him straight and they explain well we're not gods we're not angels we're knights and first of all is like what is a night i've never heard of this before so they start having this conversation and this is when things get really interesting because he walks up to the night on the horse and he looks at the knights lance and he says what is that you're holding and what's it for now it starts with a lance this is really important because that is the first thing in the grail procession that we're going to talk about in a minute yeah yeah and so the knight explains to him what the lance is and what it's for and then he said looks the shield which is shaped like a dish and he says what is that and what is it for and he starts going through all of their stuff until he gets to their armor their haubergs and when he gets their hobbics the question he asks is not what is that and what is this for but he says how does that serve right that's his question about the knights gear is how does it serve um and this is so this is the question that he's asking when he's faced with you could say the next thing on the ladder of ontological hierarchy uh so he goes back to his mother and he questions her he learns the first time about his father he look who is this crippled knight who was pierced through the thighs who could not defend his lands or his fortune so when king arthur pendragon uh they lost everything uh he had to be carried on a litter because he couldn't ride his horse all this stuff she sees that she cannot dissuade him from his intent to leave home now and become a knight and so percival's mother gives him a series of instructions and she limits the fact that he'll probably be killed because he doesn't know how to fight but she gives him a series of instructions and the instructions that he gets at each level of the ontological hierarchy are very important the first instruction he get he's given is to give aid to any lady he meets okay this is important part of chivalry and this comes with a provisio that he's allowed to accept any token that he's given from a lady up to a kiss but if the lady tries to give you anything more than a kiss percival you gotta say no yeah it's very delicately put in the bone second thing he's supposed to do is to ask the name of any man who shows him hospitality because she says and i quote this is from the poem it is by the name that we know the man. now percival still hasn't been told his name we don't even know his name he's just called a young man at this point in the poem yeah so we don't know him and he doesn't know himself the third thing he's told is that he's to stop and pray at a church or at any church or chapel that he comes across and percival doesn't know what a church or chapel is because he's never seen one before and so he's told that this is a place quote filled with relics treasures holy wherein they offer up the body of jesus christ so already there's this foreshadowing of what the grail is all right so uh keeping all of these things in mind percival doesn't yet have an identity he doesn't have a name he doesn't know how to act in the new world that he's entered into and this introduces a theme that we see repeat itself over and over again in the poem which is that as percival climbs the ontological hierarchy he always lacks the information we can say he lacks the manners that he needs to move in that particular rung of the ladder so can you just say something that's interesting i just want to mention something that the structure that you're you're presenting it's very it's it's very powerful because even the idea that he's in the wild is part of it like he's definitely all everything there is there to show that he doesn't have an identity and so we there are several stories where angels like even in the gospel when the apostles come to encounter the pagans and then they're like oh they they they bow down before them it's because you can understand that whatever level you are if you receive something from above it can appear to you at first as being the highest thing right that's the problem of idolatry itself is that something comes from above and so you're like okay this that's the thing that appears to me it's the highest thing and so luckily for him the the knights were those that would render glory up right and say no it doesn't it's not us like maybe we like in a way they were vehicles for him to go up the the ladder but they're able to to place themselves properly in a way as true angels and say no it's like we're just messengers for something higher that you need to access later let's say and that can help you understand why the flattened cosmology that most of us are working with most of the time today why a it's very difficult for somebody in that mindset to understand traditional christian veneration right because you you you see something like an icon of the mother of god and and you see us kissing it or or hear the things that we're saying about her and you're like oh you must think she's the highest thing but we don't think she's the highest name there's it's there's something infinitely above her right uh but um uh but but because when you have this flattened cosmology you're always liable to look at any bright thing that presents itself to your attention as this is the highest thing now which is why it's also simul while simultaneously it makes you you know maybe a little paranoid about idolatry in that form yeah okay it also makes you very liable to idolatry when like a a really great athlete uh or a a pastor you really love who's a really good preacher or something like that when that person presents themself right um because because there's just there's not room in your field of attention for a normal high escalating levels a normal hierarchy yeah so um so so he has to rely on the advice that he gets from the guardian of each threshold uh which is advice which he only ever sort of imperfectly puts into place and you could say this sort of for us corresponds to the entrance into the church both our entrance you know for the first time when catechesis begins we take our first step up the mountain right and so we're told that percival is clothed by his mother in these garments of skin they're specifically said to be garments of skin uh he's dressed like a welshman um and he and and he crosses a river to leave his home nice and by the way every time that he comes to a new you could say like a new tier a new rung in the ontological hierarchy he crosses a river so that's a just a very easy sort of symbolic key that you can look for in the story okay it's a very again it's a very beautifully structured story um and so uh garments are very important in the story and they signal the way that old and new things identities are adopted or cast off their coverings they're things that are used to both can protect from danger but also to confer identity so in mystical terms we could say we're in the narthex now so percival's first few encounters in the world of chivalry do not go smoothly i'm not going to like summarize the entire poem because it's pretty long but essentially he meets a maiden and instead of simply receiving her ring as a free gift he misunderstands his mother's instructions and he takes the ring also a kiss which actually causes a rift between her and her very jealous lover who he who believes that she has now been unfaithful to him and it's a whole thing uh she'll she comes up later she actually turns out to be principal's cousin which is super awkward um percival also meets a particularly troublesome night known as the red knight the red knight has stolen guess what he's stolen john i don't remember what he said stolen a cup okay from arthur's court um guinevere's favorite cup and as a result the king the the court of arthur has been thrown into silence okay everyone is sad there's no more laughter but it's science and again silence and laughter and speaking too much or being silent too much those are like to the main uh contrast in this poem okay so he's stolen arthur's cup um and uh so you know watch for some of these themes as they come up up come up again there's a heavy silence laying on everyone except for sir k who is the king's seneschal his sort of foster brother and who in this particular poem is a pretty awful person and so he uh he laughs and disparages uh uh percival because of principle's bad manners which include riding his horse right into the king's hall because he doesn't know any better and this sets up a rivalry between percival and k which is one of the subplots of the story so when the red knight stole the king's cup he actually spilled or splashed the wine all over queen guinevere so her honor has been insulted and none of arthur's knights are courageous enough to go out and challenge the red knight and so percival goes out and he sort of accidentally kills the red knight with his javelin um but he's unable to remove his armor because he doesn't understand how any of it works so again he has to ask somebody how does this work what is this for how do we put this on so somebody else comes along and helps him remove the armor and put it on himself and this is the beginning of his chivalric career so the beginning of percival's career as a night actually begins with a rupture of communion around a stolen cup right and to get the cup back he has to go out and become a knight and so all of this is uh not without some regret he is actually sad about he doesn't want to get rid of the garments of skin that his mother gave him who actually puts his armor on over them rather than discarding them this is another move up the ontological ladder and this is accompanied by once again the crossing of a river and the meeting of a new mentor so you could say at this point he's gone as far as his mother's knowledge can can take him right he's followed her instructions very imperfectly but he somehow kind of stumbled himself a little higher up the mountain it crosses this next river and in this case it's the the new mentor is a guy by the name of sir gornamont who is also sometimes in the poem he's just called the worthy man the worthy man teaches percival the ways of chivalry he teaches him how to write how to fight how to use his weapons once again with every weapon the question of how does this serve or who does this serve comes up for each of the weapons he also gives him a new set of instructions by which he is to live and once again he's given new clothes uh which finally uh and he finally gives up the garments of skin that his mother gave him which he'd still been wearing under the armor and he's clothed in new uh in new garments so he's also given a set of instructions some of these are overlaps of the instructions his mother gave him before but there's some new ones so he's told now he has to always show mercy to opponents who surrender he's told how to behave to maidens which is just a repeat of the instructions his mother gave him he's told to go to church and pray also a repeat but the fourth thing that he's told and this is really critical for the story is that he's supposed to be taciturn if he finds himself because this whole time he's just been asking what's this what's this what's this it's like my my four-year-old son you know who just like we're out driving around doing errands yesterday and he wants to know why is that car different from this car what are the speed bumps in the road for like he just has all these questions about all these different things right which is really fun for me uh because you know i get to be all knowing for just like a brief moment you know um but he's told if you keep asking all these questions people will think you're a peasant people will think you're a child you need to keep your mouth closed and just ask a servant later don't don't keep asking all these questions you're embarrassing yourself etc so at this point we see percival beginning to mature he makes uh fewer silly mistakes and seems to know how to behave himself um he's been initiated into the chivalric world he's not just a pretender or an aspirant to it he has in other words undergone a baptism of sorts passing out of the north x into the nave as he's clothed in new garments and now ready and willing to face the challenges of this new level of reality and kind of an adult mature way and it's interesting or he's asked to stop asking questions because you could understand it like his position in the wild his position at the at the bottom is basically a question like who am i what is this you know what what's the per what are all these things he's he's almost like inhabiting a kind of feminine space where he's asking questions and so he gets initiated up and then at some point they're saying okay so now you have to stop being that lower part you kind of have to engage at a higher level but i can already see how that it's interesting that he would the fact that he would not be able to recover that at the end is what would do him in or something you're getting you're getting ahead but yes you're you're exactly right that's that's exactly the right intuition right so first of all has some adventures most importantly he meets uh uh blanche flewer who is sir gorman's daughter the worthy man's daughter he saves her he falls in love with her and in the middle of all this he's saving the town that she's in from siege and in the middle of all of this there's one of what to me is actually one of the most interesting and kind of evocative episodes in the poem and i just want to put this out there to artists i've actually written a poem about this particular scene because uh and and its importance to the rest of the story because i just find it incredibly evocative if you are an artist a painter maybe an icon carver and and you'd you'd like to to like help me with an illustration of this maybe let's talk about that because this is i've never seen an illustration of the scene but it's so well let me just let me unpack you've been inspiring me to make a lot of i know i know i know but you gotta do this well maybe another one you gotta do this one so what happens is that he comes to this this city which is under siege and he delivers it but while he's there he sees a um a minster right like a monastery church and he says oh i've been is the first time he's come across a church but he says i've been told i should always go into one and pray right and so he goes in because the town is under siege there are no monks who are um there are no monks in the sanctuary and he goes in and nothing is in good repair we're told that the walls are cracked and bare that the towers are ruthless that the buildings are naked to the elements day and night so you have this image of percival walking into he's never been to a church before he's told he's supposed to come here and worship god and he walks in and there's no one there to meet him and the church is desolate the walls are cracked everything's crumbling around him and uh so he's just sort of sad and confused and he leaves um this is going to be important later on in the story but to me it's just one of the most i mean if you wanted to sort of explain uh i know i know there's a famous classicist who once said something like modern people are barbarians living in the ruins of an advanced civilization you know um and to a certain extent like you know that that image of of like showing up to a church and saying you know i'm supposed to be here to worship god and to do a certain thing and and here i am i mean you and bishop aaron were getting into this in a lot of your recent conversation right about trying to recover cosmic christianity and there i i just i have to tell you this is nothing against bishop baron who is doing great work and god bless him there were many times i wanted to jump in and say something like um i do you ever feel that way like when you listen to other people's yes that way all the time like man can i could i just can i just push on that a little bit or say something here but um but that was a great conversation and the uh the what is it that you wanted to say richard oh man i'm trying to remember now i'd have to go i'd have to go back and listen to there's just a couple of little there were a couple of little things where i was like i was like um it wasn't so much like disagreeing with him but i i just wanted to i just wanted to like like add a little something i mean that's how you know it was a good conversation like i felt it was engaging i felt like i was there and i wanted to be like oh but but but um all right so you're saying but you're saying that this experience of going into the church and finding it in disrespect finding something different yeah and there's no one there to show you the way there's no one there because all those people are honestly it's not their fault right in in the case of this you know all the mugs and the nuns there's actually two churches he goes into because there's a monastery and a nunnery in the same city so it goes into the minister for each of them and finds them both in the state right and so all the monks and the nuns they're they're gone because they are we're told that they are frightened and wary so these people are basically just trying to like survive the city's under siege and so they've they've totally left the maintenance of the house of god to kind of look after themselves and and you know try to hold whatever semblance of life they can together right and i don't know i just makes you think of a certain moment uh yeah in in our like uh say this moment right now and i think i mean it's funny because you're right even sometimes you know you even people who go in who who are interested in in orthodoxy you know sometimes that's that's even their experience right yeah they feel like okay this is not what i was told it was going to be like 100 well and i i want to say like for those of us who have had this experience at some point in our lives right of of like entering the house of god and finding it kind of vacant and empty and crumbling and being like what's the big deal why is this really important right it's not totally the fault of the people who are there like maybe maybe you could you could you could say well i wish every one of these people had had the martyrs courage to kind of push on through but even even the stuff that you and bishop were talking about this is part of what i wanted to say is that like the the the kind of the the denuding of a lot of the beauty of the catholic tradition right a lot of those people were were uh who were pushing that stuff i mean there definitely was probably some malice on the part of some people but i think a lot of people who who went along with it like the rank and file the just the normal prisoners the people on the ground they really thought this was going to save them yeah right they really thought this is going to help them right and so they were they were already in kind of a like modernity was was already so ugly and so strong and so imposing and and it's really easy to feel like we're just under siege all the time and when you're in that mode when you're thinking in that way you can let the really beautiful things go and and that's that anyway so i i just i define this particular moment which i've never heard anybody really talk about or illustrate uh but i find this particular moment in the story really really vivid so all right so uh to push on a little bit this is also the first time that he goes into a church yeah first time he doesn't go to church yeah i mean it makes sense too that as he's coming from below he would kind of encounter the brokenness and the the fragmented part of what he moving into right yeah um you could you could imagine somebody who like as as you're coming up from below and you get into the orthodox church and you're like oh i'm here now or the roman catholic church or something you're like oh i'm here now and things are so beautiful and then you realize that actually there's also brokenness and scandal and there are there are bad bishops and there are there are you know acrimonious parish council meetings right all you know and and just like lots of people on the internet who all have an opinion about how you should be you know living your life even though they're not your spiritual father like you know like you have all these different things and uh and the danger is to do what percival did which is he gets there and he's like and he walks out yeah what is this yeah like what is this what's happening right so at the end of all of this um before he marries blanche fleur uh he decides he needs to return to his mother and we get a little detail here uh when he had when he'd been leaving and crossing over the river he looked back over the bridge and he saw his mother pass out but he just kept going anyway and so suddenly that recollection kind of stings him a little bit he's like i should go see if mom is okay you know um and so he he goes back to so he leaves the town that he had saved and by the way we're told that he leaves in a procession like unto the day of ascension which um and in intends to bring his mother back so that she can take the veil he wants to bring her back to this town he's in so she can become a nun and he can be here with his girl and they can all kind of live together um and and that i people watching your channel probably know this but that's not a bad thing in the middle ages when you're like i would like my mom to become a nun he's he's not saying he's not saying i want to like put her away so she's not in my way anymore like this is this is a good thing like it's a you know especially if you're like a noble lady and then you become a nun you you're usually in charge of the monastery so it's like in other words he wants his mom to be looked after and comfortable and to live this life of beauty and rest now that he's delivered the city from from siege but we're told that uh this is like the feast of ascension uh which i think just brings back to mind that that icon that the the fresco of the virgin of the pyrenees right with the the mother at the center right in this in this image of ascension that we talked about last time and there seems to be echoes of that here and of course there are a lot of scholars who think that um that's one of the main origins uh for kretion when he's writing his romance so you know just a nice nice image there but percival can't go home again or at least he can't go home again easily not the same way that he he left so he comes to a third river and of course the thing is that his house is on the his home is on the other side of the third river so it's not totally clear is the third river a different river or is it the first one again right this is the third river the third liminal moment in the story but this time percival can't see a way to cross so he meets a man fishing in the river there's no bridge but he meets a man fishing the river who tells him go up the road where he's going to find lodging and a way across the river this turns out to be the castle of the fisher king and this is where the real adventure of the grail begins so the fisher king sits on a bed in the middle of his castle he has some kind of a wound in his loins as a result of which he cannot get up from his bed which is exactly the case for percival's father and in fact we find out at the end of percival's story that the fisher king is his mother's brother so he's percival's uncle and the middle ages to be your to be a maternal uncle is as close or in some cases actually closer than being a father because because if somebody is your sister's son he can't legally inherit anything that you have so he's got no reason to kill you to take your stuff and he's got no reason to and so what what it means is like there's the there's usually a very strong bond of love because it's like a strong bond of loyalty without threat of usurpation you could say yes so that's who the fisher king is but principal doesn't know that yet um and of course the fisher king is the same wound as percival's father so it's like a deliberate kind of recapitulation so while he's in the fisher king's castle he sees a strange procession they're sitting at the table they're eating and the door opens and then comes first a squire bearing a lance the tip of which is not merely bloody but actually bleeding right because of course when you stab jesus jesus wounds the lance right and so so the the the tip of the spear is not merely bloodied but it's bleeding and percival wants to ask what's the purpose of the lamps um he wants to ask the question that he had asked the knights when he first met them which is how does it serve what's it serving who's it serving and this is what percival does when he encounters something new beyond the knowledge that he has from his previous identity something beyond the tier of the ontological ladder which he's used to inhabiting he wants to ask what's it for how does it work and then just as he's about to ask he thinks back to the advice that the worthy man gave him which is don't ask too many questions people will think you're a peasant people will think you're a child so he doesn't ask and the procession continues and there are two more young men come out bearing tapers and candelabra a total of 10 candles and they're followed by a virgin a young maiden who bears in her hands a grail which is a wide shallow covered dish we're told large enough to serve a pike or a lamprey in other words it's a very large dish intended for serving fish which is an obvious eucharistic symbol as anyone in the middle ages would have known yeah percival is unaware of its contents though because it's covered but the most striking thing about the grail is that it shines brightly with its own light just like the grail that the virgin holds in the image of the pyrenees shines brightly with its own light so brightly that it far out shines the large candelabra which preceded it and once again percival is just dying to know what is all of this about the grail is clearly special it's holy it's valuable but there's no clear indication as to why the procession is happening or why it's happening now so the question he wants to ask is how does this serve who is it serving principal wants to know but again he thinks back to the worthy man's advice and he doesn't ask and once again as the table before him being filled with these unimaginable delicacies the grail passes before him again the lance the whole procession and once again he wants to ask the question who's it served once again he keeps his mouth shut and by the way he's also not observed any of the other pieces of advice he was given he doesn't ask the name of the man who shows him hospitality if he did he'd find out it was his uncle um he uh if he'd asked that a great deal of trouble would have been saved uh he so he decides to wait until the next morning and ask at the servants but when he awakens the next morning the castle is totally empty and the chance to ask the question has been lost yeah so the very next person that he meets is the maiden whose ring he stole back at the beginning of the story and uh whose life he unintentionally ruined she tells him the story of the fisher king that he was a king a noble wounded by battle in battle biolance which pierced him through both of his sighs thighs which is same story he was told about his father she excitedly questions percival because she assumes that he is asked the question uh who how searched the grail whom does it serve and when she finds out that he is not asked she becomes distraught she mocks percival and it is this moment is when percival's true name is revealed which he has not known up to this point of course his mother once told him by a name you will know a man and now for the first time percival comes to real self knowledge but it's a deeply painful self-knowledge so if we want to follow our liturgical reading of the story we see this third river which may or may not be the first river kind of symbolizes the third and the final barrier to principles ascent up the mountain it's the veil drawn over the holy of holies it's the rude cree root screen the iconistas which seems to bar the way to the mysteries and given the dependency of grail legends uh like i said on on the the divine liturgy the rituals of the christian east i don't think it's surprising here that the grail procession as many many scholars have noted is basically identical to the great entrance which is when the patents and the chalice are brought out accompanied by tapers and incense and if there are enough clergy serving one of them will also carry a knife yeah which we call the spear or the lance which is used to divide the body of christ um yeah which is something i think a lot of people don't necessarily know that right yeah yeah yeah actual utensil that is used to cut the it's actually used in the liturgy to pierce the right the bread is is definitely related to the land itself it's related to lance it's it's the spear right so you have silence and speech and laughter all playing a crucial role in this tale in a lot of ways i i didn't have time to get into um as they do in most arthurian stories actually um you you need a you know to link back to your merlin story that you had like two years ago because i think it's time that people got that back in their consciousness now now that we've seen a lot of things happen over the last two years it would be good to remind people of that story um so here's the thing there's a time to keep silent before a mystery but this is not the kind of silence which percival has been enjoying to practice by the worthy man his silence might be characterized by the old adage often repeated to me by my father because i'm a talkative person right that light is faster than sound that's why everybody looks smart until they open their mouth um uh so this is the silence of somebody who's been embarrassed before somebody who's looked foolish looked childish before and has spent the rest of their life from that moment on trying to prove that they should be taken seriously uh for some you know there's lots of examples of this happening in the poem uh that people people can go and read for themselves but the source of percival's child niches his childhood childishness and his naivete is his lack of a father right somebody who could have taught him the use of arms and most importantly would have given him his true name conferring identity upon him and in the castle of the fisher king percival is really close to healing this wound um all he has to do is to ask the right question yeah but the question is basically what is it and what's its reason it's like it's basically the ontological question yeah right right which is the fundamental question that percival asked when he was down here yeah that's what makes you go up the ontological hierarchy in the first place like right you're you're about you're amongst a bunch of stuff and then you ask you kind of see this stuff coming together and then you ask oh what is it what is it for and once you do that then you can jump up you know a level right that's how you that's actually you know even in the most immediate way that's how we move from levels from levels of reality you know to use the the basic example that everybody mocks you for using all the time now it's like this it's the same question with like you have a bunch of parts of something like parts of a chair and then you have to ask like what is this when you see them coming together what is it for and once you know that it's for sitting on then you've you've jumped up a level like you've actually actually gone up a level in in an ontological hierarchy of course it's not the same as all the way up to the grail but you can understand this as an image of how reality works and how things how things come together and how they kind of move up you know into into into reality and that in a way you can see that when you go up you have to you kind of have to assume the level that you are and you have to stop asking the question at first only when you reach the next level that you have to start asking questions again but if you ask questions when you're or think about it like if you master something you have to master it and you have to live it if you if you keep asking questions you're not you're not you're not mastering it but once you read when you reach the next level then you have to be willing or capable of asking questions again but in this story it seems like it's like a cycle where he seems to like it as if he comes back home but now his home is like a higher version of his home you could say but he's just not totally able to to get there me like you said maybe because he lacks a father he doesn't have that identity confirmed upon him he's not capable of asking the right question to kind of connect with his because it's it's clear that his uncle his father that's it's related it's trying to get you to see that there's something pretty much the same thing is going on right and the mystery that he saw at the beginning with the different objects that he asked about is the same mystery now he's seeing but at a higher level and now he can't he can't pierce it so why do you say that it's a it's a success so if he'd ask this question he's told the fisher king would have been healed instead ruined comes upon his family his mother has died the young man in whose life he's ruined turns out to be his cousin the land suffers as a result so in divine liturgy um the very last thing that we say before communion begins to the to the to the laity right is the holy things are for the holy yeah it's a challenge it's a warning it's a statement about who these mysteries are for they are for those who put on christ we say one is holy one is lord jesus christ right um who are these four these are four little children they're for people who put on christ they're for those who come to be fed and not just to be fed but we don't in our church we don't pick up we don't pick up the elements and feed ourselves we are fed with a spoon right i have i have uh four children i've got another kid on the way in january right like i fed lots and lots of kids with spoons right it's it's messy sometimes it's um but it's necessary right and so to receive communion is is self-knowledge it's the it's the ultimate it's like the only real self-knowledge right it's a it's to find yourself in christ it heals the wound of our father adam and it bestows upon us a name that no man knows that's what saint john says excommunication though is also a kind of self-knowledge right it's anyone who has experienced the pain of ever being denied communion or or either as a catechumen you know catechumens depart right chase you out of the church or or or a penitent knows this really well so at this first time and here's the thing people always miss is that he gets a second chance okay but at this first time percival fails to achieve the grail he fails to enter into the healing of communion because he can't come to it as that child yeah he can't yeah he can't make himself small again yeah at the level where he is so that he can perceive and so there's a lot that happens at this point in the story he has some more adventures uh which sort of culminate in him writing the wrong to his cousin right so he sort of solves all of that problem and the narrative passes on to some of arthur's knights in particular gawain i'm not even going to talk about that stuff in the story today when we meet percival again when we meet first of all again we find him a lost and broken man he spent the last five years wandering in the waist looking for the lance and for the grail he's looking for healing and communion and he can't find his way he has forgotten everything including god he's forgotten god he's forgotten the laws of chivalry he's even forgotten his own name and when next we meet him percival has spent these last five years pursuing one adventure after another never stopping at a chapel to pray we're told never paying attention to the favor or the needs of ladies we're told uh in in short pursuing d's of arms but never attending to the things that either his mother or the worthy man had instructed him to do and this culminates one day he's riding along and he sees three unarmed knights along with some ladies walking through the woods and they stop him and they say sir don't you know it's unlawful to wear arms on this day and he says what's today what's special about today and they said this is good friday this is the day on which our lord jesus died you're not supposed to go armed today he said well i don't know who jesus is and i don't know what good friday is and so they tell him they tell him well go back through the woods that direction we've tied knots on the ends of branches to show you the way and you'll find a hermitage and go to that hermitage and ask the hermit and he will tell you what to do so percival follows these instructions he follows the knots on the branches until he comes to the hermitage and he meets the hermit and he starts telling the hermit his whole story and asking what's this all about and what the hermit does is he begins by catechizing percival he catechizes him by telling him and we get the whole thing he explains the entire creed to percival which had been taught to first of all but he'd never been taught what it meant so he categorized his percival and then he tells first of all who he is he tells him his name he tells him who his father was and he reveals the fact that he is also percival's uncle with the hermit the hermit is a fisher king he's i'll i'll i'll i'll be a little apathetic here and say what the poem says which is the fisher king is percival's uncle and the hermit is percival's uncle are they the same person all right yeah so hold on i was trying to pull up i was trying to pull up this passage because uh it's really really beautiful the worthy man uh which by the way the the permit is also called the worthy man so he's like every mentor right yeah all right join together yeah um misfortune has followed you of a sin for which you are ignorant and he finds out the reason that he failed to ask the question was because he left his mother when she died um and so he talks about all this and he says here's what he says here's what he says okay foolish were you not to learn who was served from the bowl the man who is served from it was my brother so he's not the fisher king but he's kind of the fisher king my sister who was and his was your mother as for that rich fisher king he is i believe um the son of the king who is himself served from the bowl so talking about the bowl what's in the bowl he asked what's in the bowl and he's told what is in the bowl is not a salmon or a pike or a lamprey but rather a single sacred wafer carried to him in the bowl we know he sustains and nourishes his life such a holy object is in the bowl and so pure in spirit is he himself that this life requires no in this life he requires no further nourishment than the host that comes from the bowl so there's uh all kinds of stuff going on here but at the end of it all he catechizes first of all and at the end of catechism he says now that he's told him who he is and he's told him why bad things happened to him and he's told him what the grail was and what his purpose was gets the end of the poem and here's what we're told he says stay with me for the next three days and eat what i eat well you have to read between the lines here it's good friday yeah three days from now is easter eat what the hermit eats in other words fast with me mm-hmm so percival basically saying you will get what you will get come from the grave yeah so first of all isaac is catechized he fasts and we're told that on easter day thus percival came to know that god was crucified and died on for on the friday and on easter percival received communion with a pure heart and then we're told here the tale says no more of percival okay you've totally convinced me that person that's the end of his story so he finds the grail but how does he find the grail he has to come to it broken he has to come to it like just totally emptied of who he is and to come again as a little child and to sort of say who am i why am i here what is this thing right and then he's catechized and then he fasts and we're actually told he puts on the hair shirt that the hermit is wearing you know again it's a change of garment a change of identity well he puts back the hair shirt from the beginning but now it's a penitential exactly accent it's the opposite of the hair shirt received from adam and eve in a way so isn't that interesting that the garment of skin become like at the at the beginning it just sort of becomes this identity of death but then later when you put it you can you can take that death on yourself and so by remembering your death it becomes transformed into life that's amazing i mean it's amazing also it's like he discovers that the grail is not the one in a way is not the one cup it's not the cup that he saw in the in the castle basically yeah in this poem it's not um in in this poem the grail is not the the idea of the cup of the last supper that comes from bravo deborah which is which is later um and that's definitely the most successful version but in this it's it's a it's a dish that holds the eucharistic host and so when we're told that and then literally a page later we're told on easter personal receive communion with a pure heart and here the tale says no more percival like you have to look at that and say right he discovered his identity he's discovered who he is and this this idea i mean one of the things you have to always keep in mind when you're reading medieval literature is that man is a microcosm so by healing percival all these other people and things that he's interacted with which in the story are basically sort of externalizations of of his his lack of identity right and and his his attempt to sort of climb the ontological ladder all that stuff is actually fulfilled and healed right and that's why that's why the mentor is is like she feeds it dementor feeds and clothes him so it's the mentor you know that hurt the hermit feeds him clothes and becomes his mother he comes he's referred to as the worthy man right so he becomes he becomes you know sir uh the worthy man he uh but he's also the brother of the fisher king so he becomes you know so he's like every every sort of culmination of all the thresholds right are sort of gathered up in him so what's super interesting like what really fascinates me about what you're saying is also if if what you're saying is is is real like if you're framing it properly it also shows the manner in which the the the like the esoteris like the kind of uh theosophist and the occultist they were always looking for another mystery like they they had the sense in which the the christian mystery was not enough and they were looking for these other mysteries and a lot of the esoteric stuff that went around the grail was this idea that there is this other initiation there's this other mystery that we can can access that is that is hard and that it's hidden but you can see that in at least in percival at least in this version it leads up to communion as being the highest mystery as being that which culminates his whole life into this moment where because it also there is a sense in which while he's going around he doesn't know who christ is but his mom says his mother says to go into a church but he he hasn't been properly catechized he doesn't understand the mystery of christ and so he can it kind of all culminates into this to this last moment and uh we're told i mean lots of beautiful little details here at the end right um when percival first comes to the starts walking down the path and i would love to know if you have a take on the the knotted tree branches that line the path yes it's mentioned multiple times and i still don't totally understand like what's the significance of that well you can understand it you can understand it the way you understand a prayer role right so you you have to understand like uh that's so obvious once you say it i'm like oh gosh it's a well a prayer rope a rosary like it's uh yeah so prayer ropes and rosies are like little worlds that connect that are connected together right so it's like you but also like a progression right you you progress up a hierarchy and then you have higher steps and you keep moving uh yeah and so what what happens as he moves along we're told that as he walks past the knots he felt his very heart sighing because he knew that he'd sinned against god and he was sorry and in tears he made his way towards the forest and when he reached the hermitage he dismounted and disarmed so uh disarmed means he took all of his armor off yeah right ties his horse to a tree and he enters the herm's dwelling and it says in that small chapel he found the hermit and a priest and a young cleric this is the truth who were beginning the service the sweetest and most beautiful that may be said in holy church so he shows up at the beginning of mass right yeah it shows up thinking the beginning of mass which is what that's the grail procession right so he shows up at the chapel and it's happening again and this time he falls to his knees and the hermit sees him weeping and comes over to him and he he he says and principle wants to receive communion and and and the the hermit tells him you have to make your confession first before you receive communion right and so that's what that's what initiates the conversation between them the exchange principles reclaiming of identity it's through this act of confession which becomes a repetition of his catechesis and his repentance culminates in you know fasting praying receiving communion so it's i mean there's all these just really beautiful details in here and there's a bunch of stuff in the story that i haven't even talked about there's a lot of things i still haven't really understood though they seem to be symbolically significant like there's an intuition that there's something there but yeah yeah but also some of it is just um some of it is just like every detail in this poem is significant and to try and summarize it and explain like my overarching thesis about it is very difficult if you keep getting hung up on all the granular levels like one of the things that comes up over and over again in this in this uh poem is the symbolism of the cloak people have cloaks that they put on that they take off that they give to other people at certain times right um which is really interesting so um but it certainly had to do with the the garmented skin and then the different clothing that he has at different levels and the armor also it probably is all related you'd have to look at what in what condition in what moment do they remove the cloak and and what is it what does it imply yeah yeah so there's there's just a lot of stuff a lot of stuff in this story um and of course there's a whole gawain portion of this so what's interesting is that gawain in this poem and that's the part of the poem that's not finished gawain in this poem isn't looking for the grail he's specifically looking for the lamps so if i had to sort of like fanfic this up a little bit and i feel like i'm i'm justified in doing so because everyone in the middle ages did i would not have great uh i would not have gawain continue searching for the grail i would have him find the lance so you'd have like sort of the person who finds the grail going finds the lance and that's how i would end the that's how i would end the romance that makes sense like you're ready but it makes sense especially if the idea that personal does indeed find the grayer right so the gawain would find something equivalent to the lands but let's say in terms of maybe something about the crucifixion or something in that right yeah so that might be a fun that might be a fun project to take up one of these days is to try to do my up do my own they're called the continuations i could do definitive continuation right so uh yeah all that to say whether or not you think percival found the grail he found the grail he didn't even because he received communion there's no doubt exactly so all right so richard roland revolutionizing but not just revolutionizing but just proving to all the modern scholars that you know cassandra what he was doing and uh yeah you know that for sure percival found the grail um and so so yeah so thanks we will continue on we there's no there's no stopping this conversation so is there something you wanted to tell us tell everybody before we uh we we let them go um i don't know when this will drop but we're currently in uh the advent season or the nativity fast if you're uh orthodox christian i would just tell everyone um keep your eyes open and your ears open right now um there's the there's a this is i like to say crazy things on other people's podcasts because then like if they choose not to edit it out that's their fault um so there's this there's this there's this tradition like a sort of like a folk superstition that on christmas eve you know and this is also true this whole idea of like halloween and other like the night before like good friday as well like the night before a really holy day right is a day when like the barriers between worlds are like really thin and stuff can slip through and um bad things can happen but also good things could happen and um what i would just say is be uh be really attentive during the season and pay attention because things are going to um and i think especially if you're a western person i think christmas i mean i think we all know christmas is bigger than easter in the west it just is right whether or not that should be the case um but and in a certain way i think like there's a particular western genius to the way that we celebrate christmas like some of those old christmas carols and i've been posting a bunch of them on facebook like those things are a symbolic gold mine yeah and mine and i don't think you can really beat them yeah christmas tree is so awesome you can't yeah yeah not a lot of stuff yeah yeah no we have a there's a particular western genius for celebrating christmas and what i would say is just be just be really attentive to the things that are happening the patterns that are manifesting this season um and of course at the end of it all look for christ so all right thanks richard and so uh yeah i think that's true we probably will drop this just before christmas so i wish you i wish all of you merry christmas as well and we'll see you in the new year this episode is part of a series of discussions i've had with richard roland on universal history you can find a list of all these episodes on my youtube channel where you can find them also in my podcast stream from the symbolic world on your different podcast platforms make sure to check out richard's second podcast which he hosts in collaboration with father andrew damick called amman sewell which looks at the relationship between tolkien and orthodoxy this podcast has also inspired me some ideas for creating some images whether it be the king under the mountain whether it be the grail or beautiful ethiopian traditions i've created some products which you can find on my store the symbolicworld.store and there will probably be more of those to come very soon so stay tuned this conversation is ongoing and there is still very much to explore in the universal history
