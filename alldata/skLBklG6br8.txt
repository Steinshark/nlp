unless you've been living under a rock you've probably been overwhelmed to say the least with some of the big Tech announcements that have come out I mean today alone open AI just announced a new GPT model that is faster than ever before well can you take a guess at what I might be doing based on what I'm showing you here from what I can see it looks like you're in some kind of recording or production setup with those lights tripods and possibly a mic it seems like you might gearing up to shoot over now going into this week we have a lot of updates that are going to be coming from Google's conference yet to be determined as to what those are but the point is we are in a week going to have Tech move and change at such a quick Pace it just feels like you can never keep up a lot of us are continuously learning and improving our skills to whether it's for the promotion whether it's you're running your own business whatever the case may be we all have one common goal which is we want to keep up to date with tech and lat it's kind of felt well impossible and here's a news flash for you it's because it kind of is that doesn't mean that we shouldn't try what it does mean is we need to identify areas to put our focus into where we should be learning now it brings up the other question where do we know how do we know where to put our learnings it seems like there's so much to learn nowadays is it AI is AI going to fail not fail but is it going to become less in demand should I do blockchain should I do a different technology I mean how how do you know if this sounds like you I really want to reassure you you aren't alone I just basically shared what my brain goes to all the time on a daily basis as I see all these updates I mean especially as someone who is a tech content creator as well I'm always trying to stay up to date with what is coming up in Tech and lately it feels really difficult in this video I am going to share with you two different key aspects one being how do I identify Tech trends that are worth keeping up to date with how do you identify what you should be putting your learnings to whether it be learning a new technology uh reading more or doing research more on one specific thing or do you just kind of let the trend past there are certain signs that you will be able to identify after watching this video as to what to look for whether Tech is a technology that's really trending is going to stay or if it's just going to be a fat all right let's dive into [Music] it now before we dive into exactly what tips to use to learn these technology or identify what will remain we also need to look back at what went wrong previous times now for this I want to use the example of cryptocurrency and with the little sub caption though that cryptocurrency is very much still a very prominent technology with blockchain of course blockchain itself is used in so many different Industries but I want to use this as an example because that had so many signs from when it peaked and we were all learning blockchain we were all building smart contracts to now even though it's still very in Dem demand there's way less demand than there used to be I think there's some funny memes about this uh on the internet I'll try and find them and insert them here but it was really those things when cryptocurrency started really trending in the tech World everyone wanted to learn about blockchain I remember I wanted to become a blockchain developer at the time and thought Oh I'm going to switch my whole career this is the way to go we need to stay ahead get hired while it's hot make that money you know please tell me I'm not alone on this then fast forward now although it's in demand it's not nearly like that now we have ai and AI has been trending for the past what is it 2 years now really really since the launch of chat when did chat GPT launch okay just figured it out 2022 so yeah two years ago wow a good tip two years ago 2 and a half years ago at this point at that time then we saw this next big bubble happen where it was everyone wanted to get into AI everyone wanted to become an AI or machine learning engineer and rightfully so when you see those salaries of these high paying jobs it's easy to be like okay I'm pivoting my whole career into this area there's so much demand for it the market right now in general isn't that great so when you see this Tech being so in demand you naturally want to jump on and be part of the bandwagon the first thing you really need to keep in mind before you start diving into learning and new technology is how long has this been around for now this doesn't always work per se but when you start and think about say something like AI that's been around for so so many decades so many years you realize that this isn't something knew that's trending in the sense of this Tech isn't going to work it's more so you know it's stable you know it's going to be around for a very long time that is a really good sign just like with AI you saw it was kind of you know steady and then all of a sudden with chat gbt everything really changed overnight but the technology itself has been around for a long time it's evolved very quickly as of recent but it doesn't it's not going to go anywhere and we're very certain of that looking at its past the best way to really make predictions about prediction predictions can't speak today about the future is to look actually at our past and what has happened in the past now with something like say cryptocurrency to varying degrees this was around for a while but not nearly as long as Ai and in turn that might have been something that was a sign as to okay let's just see how this plays out longer versus jumping right into becoming the next blockchain developer which is still great by the way now when you look ahead though at these trending Technologies does it mean they're going to stay as in demand as they are today no that we can't fully predict what we can predict though is based on the number of job openings that are opening up for these roles where the technology is headed I mean with something like I know I keep on referring to AI but I think it's a really good example with AI it's threaded throughout our entire ecosystem and all businesses in our daily lives so you know it's a safe bet if you are interested in that and that brings me to my second point which is if you are interested in that why I really emphasize that is because Tech as we've seen will come and go with different trends no one Trend will remain AI is really hot today there will be something else that is hot tomorrow it is not going to remain Ai and if you are jumping into Tech Trends and learning about tech Trends whether it's say uh becoming a machine learning engineer or on the business side of AI you actually need to enjoy learning about this because it's very very complex and it's very nich and specific and if you are not actually invested in your career going down that path you are setting yourself up for failure because you're quickly learning about it to get ahead but then when something else comes you're shifting your career that way now this brings me to my third tip which is evaluate your current skill set and I think this is so important because if you are more junior or just starting out your career it is a bigger risk or bigger jump the more new technologies that you are diving into if you it is taking you away from learning and really mastering the fundamentals of whether it be programming or if you're on the business side the theoretical side of these Technologies and this is because when you have been developing for a long time or working in the tech industry for a long time it's easier to quickly gain a sense of these trending Technologies maybe even pivot your career but if you are just starting out and you're putting all of your eggs into that basket it does feel more permanent more of a bigger impact than if you have this long resume to go off of uh prior to jumping into the trending technology so my biggest takeaway or biggest piece of advice for someone who's just starting out their career is actually to not do any do not focus on learning any trending technology unless you have really mastered the fundamentals of uh Tech as a whole and it's kind of vague but if you are on the developer side understanding all the basics of the development that you are learning if you are on the design side same kind of thing and the next one I really need to bring up is you need to network and ask people and what I mean by this is for me when I really started asking people as to their thoughts on these Technologies you know I'll give you the example I Curr studying uh Ai and machine learning in postgrad and I before just taking that course jumping into it I had many calls with the school actually I had calls with people who took that course I've seen where they're at now like I did my research and that really helped me as to knowing is this worth my time to be learning these new things in this case Ai and ml or is it going to be you know am I getting sucked into what's trending at this moment once you have uncovered you know if it's worth you learning these new technologies that are trending next topic or next big bucket is this which is well how do you learn them very efficiently one of the biggest things for me when I am learning something new and I have to do so at a very quick or rapid pace is the following I will always start by going back to the documentation which is the worst it's most boring I know but if it's a new thing either technical or soft skill reading about it understanding how this really works from there I love taking a tutorial and I think tutorials get a bad rap especially as of late you know we always talk about tutorial hell getting stuck in that continuous cycle of leaning on tutorials to learn one thing after another but in reality tutorial tutorials can actually be a really good thing and you just need to know or identify once you hit that point where it's maybe you know you've done enough tutorials for me I like to set that at two if it's a longer one on say you to me then maybe it's one even but having that bandwidth of you know having a tutorial is great it's almost like you're taking a class you need to digest this information and to do so a tutorial that really breaks things out is a great way to go from there I honestly still like to join online communities if I'm learning something new in my case about Ai and ml for me that was a community Through slack that was uh taken in that course but if it's or not slack sorry but that the portal in that course but if you are someone who's taking kind of an independent tutorial honestly Googling or searching up different kind of uh slack channels to be part of or groups to be part of as you're learning makes such a difference and more often than not you will meet either other people to network with or have these great conversations with and you never know where they're working it might lead to a thing or two okay this one might be kind of strange to some of you but if you do it I promise you it makes a big difference which is I will actually when I am ramping up learning something new especially a technology that is trending but I'm like this is worth me investing my time and resource's energy all of that into I will also ramp up on my time on spending time on social social media and also to newsletters now here's the the butt with the social media for social media I'm already very particular as to who not only who I follow but who is not muted so you know you have to sometimes follow people who for you know your your mom or your friend or something like that where you're like yeah I don't really want to see your content just mute them and really curate your feed to be specific as to what you are focused on learning I love to follow people who are educating others putting uh you know real world examples out there helping other people because for me I can either learn something quickly or there's some value in me spent on my time in social media in that moment so what I will do as I'm learning new technology ramp up time on social media actually when because I've curated it so good to be more educational content and then on the newsletter side I love new newsletters my favorite one right now still is tldr too long didn't read they have one specifically for AI and and then they also have one for web development and both are really great they keep you up to date as to trending topics what's coming up really quickly and also to kind of summarizes everything now the last way when learning something quickly is through the use of AI one of my favorite ways to learn new things is actually having conversations with chat GPT and this is interesting because today as I am making this they just announced as I mentioned earlier their new mod was it a new model I think it was a new model let me see yeah new model and one of the things it's going to be able to do is have these really humanlike conversations with you where they are able to uh you know study with you at a different level and just make you feel as though it's your own personal tutor I think this will really help ramp up learning and take it to the next level now until we can start playing around with that one though even using the existing chat GPT models to or sorry open AI models for chat GPT to have conversations with I find so helpful it's almost like this throughout the day if I have an idea I need to bounce off with someone or if I'm wanting to explain something cuz I think that's how it works technically but I'm not sure I'll just talk to chat jpt it's honestly a GameChanger and I think it really helps me stay ahead because the more you're able to communicate out these technical topics that you are focused on learning the more it reinforces your learning so it's a win-win all right those are my tips when I'm looking to understand is this trending Tech worth learning is it worth diving into or is it something that will just pass the other thing is then once you identify this trending Tech that you are interested in I wanted to share as I did some tips to help you learn faster I mean we are all so busy the older we get the more busy we get the less time we have it's kind of stressful but we got this and then the number one thing is through this community leave
