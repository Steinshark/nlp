have you ever taken your shiny new graphics card home only to be disappointed at how you can't turn the settings up as far as you want in some hyped up AAA game it turns out that in many cases this isn't because the GPU is underpowered instead you might not have enough video memory or the amount you do have might just be too slow but the next generation of vram gddr7 promises to help alleviate some of these issues with never before seen bandwidth this is a big deal because of the rapidly increasing demands being put on gaming PCs where the high resolution textures and complex visual effects of big name titles can overload all but the highest End Hardware meaning you need enough high-speed vram to hold all that data that the GPU is being asked to process in fact one of the more common gripes from folks who bought the RTX 3070 on upper tier GPU was that it only came with eight gigabytes of vram resulting in performance issues and graphical glitches and games the GPU itself could probably have handled enter gddr7 which is expected to bring us a huge bump in memory bandwidth without sucking down more power which is great news for those who just want to turn up the settings but are already fighting the rising power draws of neurogen graphics cards we're talking 36 gigabits per second per pin once you translate this into a card with a 256-bit wide memory bus that is a full 1.15 terabytes per second of throughput to put that into perspective the RTX 4080 only has around 700 gigabytes per second of every bandwidth so all that extra space in the pipe could help demanding titles even without adding more actual vram but what exactly is the secret sauce that allows gddr7 to reach these new heights we'll tell you right after we think of videocom struggling to make your presentations engaging video com can help with that with a bunch of features to spruce up your projects such as per slide webcam embedding automatic Cloud saving and team collaboration tools making a presentation has never been more easy and intuitive turn that drab PowerPoint presentation into an experience that will be sure to leave an impression with your audience check out Videocon at the link below for free and use code Linus for 50 off any paid subscription gdr7 uses a little trick called Pam three and that's not the stuff you spray on your pan so the tater tots don't stick it's pulse amplitude modulation in Pam 3 each clock cycle can have three voltage States positive one negative one or zero each sequence of two cycles encodes three bits of data for example of negative one followed by a positive one corresponds to the bits 0 1 0. in this way each clock cycle encodes 1.5 bits of data instead of just a single bit but you're a Savvy viewer and maybe you already know that the current top end video memory gddr6x actually supports pam4 I mean isn't that better four is a bigger number than three I think maybe well it's only better to a point Pam 4's encoding scheme actually delivers two bits per cycle making it faster than Pam 3 on paper but there are some drawbacks four possible States per cycle means that there's a greater chance for errors in data transmission and to compensate for this you need more error correction functionality as well as a new physics physical design and different memory controllers all of these things increase both the cost and the power consumption not to mention that the gddr6x can only operate in pan4 mode when data is being sent in eight byte bursts instead of the more standard 16 bytes meaning gdpr6x can actually have less bandwidth overall in real world scenarios put all this together and gddr7 is supposed to give us more bandwidth while being more energy efficient than gdr6x not to mention it can switch off Pam 3 when it's not needed and instead use the one bit per cycle nrz scheme but what are we actually going to see in our graphics cards the answer is probably late 2024 as that's when we're due for another major GPU refresh from both AMD and Nvidia and reports are already out that Nvidia may be planning to use gddr7 for its upcoming RTX 5000 GPU series which I will definitely be buying as long as I can sell a couple of my organs first thanks for watching guys like dislike check out some of our other videos account with video suggestions down below and don't forget to subscribe and follow
