there are ideas that are a twinkle in somebody's eye that are about 5 years out I don't really believe too much further out than that because actually with the best will in the world you will have something that you don't know about will change your mind for you so yes with what you know now you've got an idea what you would do in 5 years time truth be told that what you think will happen in 5 years time won't so events will change you where do you start often it all starts before we ever get into play so somebody will design a consumer device and they'll design it out of you know a beautiful animum case with some holes drilled in it and they'll Analyze That and they'll say right for this not to get too warm to the you to the hand cuz people don't like warm hands we can dissipate X Watts so that's the number you start with then you subtract and then you say oh well I want this beautiful new screen and and it's got to have 16k resolution or whatever it is and it's got to have these colors and that's going to use this much power um and they say oh well of course these days people download lots and lots and lots of stuff so we need this much memory that's going to use so much power then we've got to connect that up to some staff that's going to use some power so somewhere down the line I get the dregs that's left and they say right this much power um what can you do what can you do so the CPU group get given a bit and uh you know the interconnect boys will get given their bit and we get given our bit for say Graphics or video or whatever it is um and so yeah I get a budget and of course like all budget discussions you argue you know and you negotiate and you say I can't do it for that I need this and they say that's all you're getting and bit of horse trading takes place is that space as well as power is that so it depends who you are if you're building a super phone silicon space is almost No Object it it's money so it used to be there was a constant in the industry 10 cents per square millimeter of silicon tested functioning packaged out the door in millions quantity 10 cents per square mil nobody knew why it just always was it's actually gone up as the modern processes in the last two processes that's gone up quite a bit um but essentially it's money silicon area is money um but if you're building a a real hero phone then I won't say money is No Object but it it it's it's one set of criteria if you're building a mid-tier phone um money is everything and so they care much more about uh how much we can do in x square mil and actually that ends up with two products so you get one product road map that goes uh how much performance per watt and uh how much per the other product road map is how much performance per square millimeter and and of course those two overlap a bit but essentially uh the hero phones are all thermally limited so the different companies different manufacturers that will have a different Power number but essentially they'll say what can you do at a wat or what can you do in 700 Ms or what can you do in 1.5 it's because they're making sufficient margin on it that the amount you spend on the Silicon is easier whereas when you're shipping a you know a a a a serious shipper of mid-range phones could be shipping some hundreds of millions of these chips you know you can imagine take a 100 million and multiply it by 12 cents a square mil and you know sooner or later it adds up to real money so they very very much care so every single sort of scrap of silicon they can save is really absolutely absolutely um the margins being worked on these days in that in that area of Market very very tight we've had stand up RS about fractions of a square millimeter um this is grownup it's a real grownup game you know there are people as I say making 200 million chips uh you multiply that by3 of a square mil that's their margin G uh so yeah it's a very very tight game so that's where it starts then that gets handed down to us internally and say well what can you do and it's right okay so efficiency measured two ways but efficiency is absolutely key to everything we do because if if you weren't doing it efficiency you wouldn't need a GPU at all so the only reason you're doing something on a graphics processor is because it's more efficient you know try not to forget that and try to make it as efficient as possible and then you say well that's all well and good but what actually did you mean by do it and of course it changes year on year um so graphical content gets more complicated um so the 3D games get more complicated uh user interfaces uh change as well the way people want to do those and actually those two are almost completely separate tasks now a a GPU that's good at UI and a GPU that's good at 3D gaming are almost different devices so you have to shmear between the two to make sure they're both being done right um and so you have people crystal ball gazing and say right but if you start designing a GPU now it's going to be in a consumer device then I think the content that it's going to intercept with is going to do this so we better have a GPU that's good at doing that okay so right we're going to have to change the way we do X so this unit's got to be ripped up and start again oh that unit good news that unit's okay so we won't do the whole GPU but this bit's got to be ripped up um and so there's a whole bunch of whatti go on there and then clever people go away and say well if that's the case if you give me this set of assumptions rather than that set of assumptions then I would design it in this way and then they go away and uh design it they um they sit around scratching their heads and working on whiteboards and you'll see all of these offices have more more whiteboards than you could possibly imagine I've clean mine especially for this interview then they'll model it they'll actually write a computer program um uh to model how this would work start getting an idea of what's efficient what's not efficient then they would probably prototype it as hardware and then the whole process of simulation starts to try and measure its efficiency so um you know how much power would it use how big would it be how fast would It Go um and usually as because this is engineering not physics um go around that Loop you know repeat repeat until finished and of course it's never finished eventually the engineering manager says uh boys we're supposed to ship this next Thursday you know come on stop messing about finish finish it that's good enough let's get it out the door I'm you know smoothing over some of the cracks you know it's never we're shipping it next Thursday it's you know we're shipping it in six months time you've got to stop tinkering because we need to spend that six months validating it so you're obviously are adding in features as much as capabilities do you ever have to take old ones out yes but it's very difficult cuz people say oh well I just want it to be better I only ever want it to be better at everything than the the last one and you say well I can make it better at this but if I could throw out this feature or make it worse at that feature then um you know I could do a much better job on this thing you really care about and of course manufacturers are usually very very reluctant to do that because they said well I don't know I think I might have customers who are relying on that and I genuinely don't know so deprecating old features is hard we get there in the end it's really hard if you just have this plan here and want to execute it without the automation it's really really hard it takes a lot of experience and even then and then there's the hash that you found at the end it's also worth saying that miners tend to work in pool
