I want to talk about data validation which is about presenting data visually to help people find patterns in data or better understand data we're actually using data validation a lot already so I think if you use the Microsoft Excel you create some bar charts or line charts before and you are doing databization so that's a kind of most common form when people have been doing this for a long time so I want to show you this map probably it was not called visualization or data valuation before them so this has happened in a cholera epidemic I think was in London they plotted every case on the map each bar is one case and that's where the address that was detected by looking at the map you can see that certainly is kind of center of the disease happening and they eventually located as well with the water was contaminated that would become the source of the cholera and all these are kind of very easy to see retrospectfully but at the very beginning when they look just at the patient and record they just couldn't figure out what was the problem for a very long time one of the biggest changes now lots of these visualizations are created automatically using computers obviously in the 1844 sorry 1854 it has to be done manually but and sometimes I think the 1854 one actually looks better the other very common type of and validation we see a lot now is the dashboard which essentially just a collection of smaller or simpler validations as we're getting more data and becomes more complex or also depends on maybe the task we want to address becomes more complex we need these more the cholera map is a good example in terms of you showing one picture of the data set and and you get a very important Insight after it and but in many cases in the actual kind of real life and it's maybe just a part of a bigger process and which I would call sense making so I think usually you people would focusing on the analyzing Parts which what the data analysis or data science is but all other parts are very important and also sometimes you might have to get additional information to help you the process I'm probably very biased but I think we do sense making all the time but I think at least two saying we just do this more often than you think so the examples is like a planning holiday and find a place to live or maybe apply for University degree so in terms of difference from data analysis so usually the goal is not well defined and the process is very open incense is explosive and iterative so the kind of a not very good analogy I use is kind of the maze you have a clear goal you want to get into the center of the maze or you want to find the crime in the tweets you want to find the degree that you want to study and but you don't know the maze so you have to explore feel your way through hopefully eventually you would get to the middle and it's kind of explore process you might have to repeat the same past a few times before you find sent the right way to the center okay and so I have a second example which is more kind of daily sense making tasks and here is a find the best cameras for 500 pounds so the context will be we just had a newborn baby so I think we should get a new camera so my wife gave me 500 pound budget so I need to say okay what the best we can get and then you started doing some online research you might try to see what experts things and in that process we might came across some technical terms you never heard before then you might do more research just to understand what those things are for example what are the micro forces or mirrorless or DSLR what does that mean it's you probably not going to finish that in one session you might say you spend now on it you didn't quite you make some progress but didn't find the perfect camera yet and you wait a few days until the weekend you want to continue but then that's often okay how do you continue the process you did two two days ago and the typical thing is so if you have a browser with open 20 30 Windows that's kind of indication you are doing some sense making yeah so this is kind of maybe the kind of more dry part and I try to kind of unpack this diagram a little bit okay the shoot boxer means the things you find interesting you might want to go back to it and look at later or in the process say doing the camera research you might find an article recommending good cameras okay you think that something you would say bookmark in your browser otherwise and you put into your shoe boxes and then the yellow one is evidence file so this is more initially was kind of created more like an intelligence analysis context so that's why the word is but to me it's kind of this text you highlighted in the browser that's kind of Nakita information that's important this is usually after you look at the things you've collected in the shoebox and the schema ties you're kind of starting to understanding the problem better and what is relevant to you see and there's a megapixel used for or maybe the aperture is actually more relevant in the case you take baby photos because you need a five I say faster shutter speeds and that's when the aperture comes into play and these are things you kind of learn in the process as a result of your exploration and learning and then the hypothesis part is where you can have come up with a few models since within your budget it all looks promising you just need to do a more kind of detailed comparison between them and finally the presentation is explaining not just the answers but actually the process to someone else rather than say have the person to do the same goes through the same process as you did mostly have to done manually by the person so that's something like hoping to support develop something so so this is kind of a step towards that goal which is a Chrome extension and you can actually download it from the Chrome web store and play but of the usual academic software quality so what it does is it try to visualize the way you have been exploring so far as the graph and rather than say just a list of it's usually seeing a history but also allow you to do other things for example you can highlight images or pictures which you find important and hopefully this will be better than say looking at the 20 tabs in your Chrome window I call this a tree or a graph saying on the right hand side and it can also be a way help you to navigate back to any previous opened tabs yeah sometimes even just being able to tell you that's something you look at the before reminded you some ways quite useful obviously this is kind of a simple example when you get more tabs it becomes more and more useful for the particular an extension I just showed so the currently kind of cover these first straight boxes but I haven't quite go beyond say how people understanding a very complex topics that's still very much done manually by the user so the goal will be eventually cover the entire process so certainly lost Works quite a bit work needed so if anyone how happy to do some research or collaborate on this will be very useful I'm very much interested to make more this one available to more people and as I mentioned this is kind of typical academic software quality at the moment so definitely needs a bit more software engineering or maintenance red stairs with red and football is green right it's a terrible example because you wanted memory you had to ask for it and release it yourself so um there are two Primitives here one's called malloc and malloc says give me some quantity
