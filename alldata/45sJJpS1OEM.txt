I'm sorry the finale of this video got a little messy and it's going to be up to you to put the pieces together things might be a bit out of them we now learn of this Savant that is The Man Behind Traders domain it took me weeks to go through all the documents but eventually a pattern started to emerge I was in my room one day and I overheard a conversation and I thought I caught something about B booking switching people from a book to bbook and so I asked Dave about it and he blatantly said to me he's like he's like yeah he's like if people are going to be losing we might as well be booked we're just leaving money on the table we traced even more money that had come in according to them roughly 450 million went into Traders domain coffee Zilla I don't think he's ever dealt with someone my size before and nobody knows anything about his family because they don't have the resources I have [Music] [Music] uh hello I knew immediately it was Ted I could tell his voice I raced to the office but you could tell by what I was wearing I wasn't expecting the conversation hey Ted thanks for taking the time man I appreciate it yeah no problem I'll keep it quick with you no problem you weren't ready for it but you've been on this case for months oh I was prepared for it I just wasn't expecting it I mean he seemed really hostile at first and like he was just trying to get me off the phone real quick so obviously ignition won right keep the guy talking I guess if since you don't have a lot of time let me just start firing off some questions for you and uh you'll forgive me if uh you know their their hard questions but I think you know given the time constraint let's make sure we get to the good stuff you know I mean I'll I'll clarify items up until 2020 because after 2020 I was no longer the owner of the platform so I don't know what happened with the platform and I think just to be honest with you uh before we continue obviously I've spoken to my counsel we we know about your YouTube channel now we reviewed it I mean there's really nothing of substance on there to be honest I think it's more of a glorified uh just clickbait Channel um I I see what you've done you've taken a lot of the local uh hot topics for the for the time and tried to monetize it so I mean I appreciate your effort I think what you're going to do is you're going to have a hard time with this back binding Mission due to the people that you're working with so I'll let you do what you need to do that's why I said we only needed five minutes um I can't really entertain your conversation because there's really no merit for it in my situation okay wait a second wait a second own Traders domain anymore because after 2020 I was no longer the owner of the platform how's that possible you know I was actually expecting this when I was going back through all those documents I saw him trying to set this up it's kind of a lot to explain might as well bore me no one else in here is going to Bar's dead tonight all right I'll tell you have you ever heard of the Panama papers Panama papers sure big news story in 2016. leaked papers show that rich people own everything not exactly a headline if you ask me no no no that that's not the real story we knew they owned everything the real headline was that they kept it offshore and the question is how did they keep that a secret I don't know I'm good lawyers more like bad laws in places like Panama you could own a company but not be on the paperwork and that's useful how well you can hide millions in companies you control but if anyone asks you about it you're off the books I see true owner is hidden that's right it's called beneficial ownership and the Panama papers was just the start okay I get that but what does this have to do with Trader's domain well our friend Ted decided to use a similar Playbook check this out here are the founding documents of Traders domain in it we see the first director's minutes where Ted sifranco and David negus got in this whole thing they both get half the company's shares but here's the key thing in January 14 2020 something changes a new director gets appointed someone named arthy kaniger and watch this after he gets in Ted resigns oh and it's in January 14 2020. that's why he says he doesn't own it that's right but also I found another document dated a little later three days later in fact an acknowledgment letter admitting that he was the ultimate beneficial owner of Trader's domain wait then doesn't that mean he still controls it yes exactly so this new director is just the Fall Guy yes now you're getting it it's what I wanted to tell Ted in the first place you know I rarely give you compliments but I really think he got him I thought he did but Ted wasn't going to go down without a fight also you said that in 2020 you signed over the account but I have an acknowledgment letter from you that says that you actually are the ultimate beneficiary owner do you want to address that no because it's not true so this signature on January 17 2020 where you acknowledge that all legal actions which may be taken by the company's director which you did sign over the director or shareholder including but not limited to signing of agreements documents are confirmed by and agreed with me as the company's ubo and I have full control over directors or shareholders actions and this is your signature at the bottom is that fake uh yeah because what what that document stamped I'm sorry you're saying this signed document from you is fake um all corporations have a feel so is there a deal on that document there's no seal in this document okay so like I said you know Ted why would somebody fake your signature on this come on um the reason why that my top or it's been popped around that's expired uh the reason why there's documents of mine that have been expired and passed around yeah I mean like I said I mean please go on a better fact-finding Mission oh what is he talking about now well check this out Ted is basically saying that the document we have isn't valid because it doesn't have a seal that looks like this on the document where ours just has his signature this guy is slick coffee I think his ability to lie is both his strength and his weakness though I mean yes he is very good but probably also why he picked up the phone in the first place oh he thought he could Bluff past you right and he's actually done it before and digging through Ted's documents I found I wasn't the only person he tried this trick on back in 2019 the Ontario Securities Commission even investigated them you mean like the Canadian government yep they already looked into him and Ted lied his way out of it I even have the emails to prove it I mean check this out at the time Ontario was concerned about Traders domain soliciting Canadian investors in 2019 so Ted said they didn't have that many and they'd be removing them from the platform by July 1st and then what when then that was that I mean it was over so what they just stopped taking Canadian clients oh of course not the investigation stopped but I found people being recruited from Canada as early as directly after the fact people like Armand a customer who said he was from Ontario and wanted to sign up and he said there was no option for it and so they replied just use crypto as the country code the same thing happened with another Canadian when he asked how to open an account their response was please use crypto as the country code I can't believe they got away with this yeah well it actually gets worse because in 2021 Ontario decided to investigate them again no way this time they caught them though right nope Ted lied again he told the investigator hope all is well we're not affiliated with this organization since early 2020. told you too correct and I think that's why Ted and David pulled this trick in the first place to avoid the feds of course now that you mention it they were first investigated in 2019 so in 2020 they do this he's already gotten away with it twice so what are you gonna do different well this time we have a bit more evidence we got that signed document but we also have even better a video from Ted saying he owns Trader's domain after he wasn't supposed to so Elkridge is located off his work at his own but we're here by myself you haven't been able to explain why this isn't the case it seems to me that you're on the record saying you own Traders domain after 2020. right you're on the record saying that on video I can send you the video if you want then we've got you a signed documents saying that you're the ultimate beneficiary owner and then we have to ask ourselves why would you resign from a company that's making so much money to some sham director did you sign it over out of the goodness of your heart or did you sign it over and secure control I didn't sign over the con I didn't sign over the the company for the goodness of my heart there was a fail made so once again like I said you don't really have your fact how much money did you make from Trader's domain zero dollars so you started it and you just sort of profited nothing you didn't make a dime no you say you sold Traders domain in 2020 that's what you say yep how much did you sell it for well I think it was forty thousand right but what I'm asking you is why would you sell a company that has millions of dollars in deposits is a successful offshore foreign exchange brokerage uh why would you sell that for forty thousand dollars because I had bigger plans why wouldn't you sell Traders domain for its true Book value because I don't care about money ah okay maybe you care about money I don't oh brother this guy's a liar Society I don't agree with Society at all I think a lot of people including yourself are very delusional in terms of what you think Society is doing what do you think society's doing well you're contributing to it but but contributing to what uh the downfall of society through social media and through the ability of people like yourself to generate Revenue based on what I would say maybe I don't want maybe the area of the wrong word or maybe you know the latest gossip the latest information about the latest gossip yeah for your monetizing this is a gigantic Ponzi scheme where people are suffering doesn't any of that matter to you once again this is your benefit not mine no no no what I'm saying is a bunch of clients come to me they say that there's this giant Ponzi scheme Ted zafranco runs it I find your name over all the documents then I come to you and you're telling me ah this is a salacious thing this is just gossip this is news of the day if a 300 million dollar Ponzi scheme or let's say the cftc's right a 145 Million Dollar Pawn scheme let's even say it's a 10 million dollar ponti scheme if a 10 million dollar Ponzi scheme is not worth talking about what is the lack of family value uh the way that people try and Destroy other people's lives by but Teddy don't you think that the person who ran this Ponzi scheme destroyed people's lives don't think they're contributing to the destruction of family values you know well I I I think when you look at the circumstance that you quote call it upon whatever you're investigating uh maybe ask those clients of yours that you're investigating if um they had free will to make decision and maybe but if they were misled right if they were misled and lied to by who will buy you Ted By Me Yeah Yeah by you can you believe it no I can't believe this I can't believe any of it neither could any of the victims I spoke to what do you think about you know maybe it's your responsibility because it's your free will to invest he's pushed that narrative before in the chat making like uh nobody ever solicited any money or anything like that but meanwhile that's all that is such a chicken response from a total coward oh my God so no accountability at all I mean this is sociopathic Behavior right this is what a real sociopath does they they detach themselves from their behavior and they blame their victims I was getting angry at this point given the disconnect between the damage this guy caused and the absolute lack of empathy did you at least show him that damage I mean I tried to when a guy tells me that his brother mortgaged his house to invest in Traders domain you don't feel like you have any culpability with that who told them the mortgage out yeah they're trying to better their lives you understand that right to support probably ostensibly his family you know you talk about caring about these Family Values Ted this guy's trying to support his family don't you think that's a good thing not really you're taking shelter and you're to invest money to invest money a mom put uh ten thousand dollars to try to invest in his her kids tuition do you not care about any of this these Family Value these families well I'm I'm thinking right now you're giving me two situations where uh people have made poor choices and now she trusts you as the owner of the Pam account and the person who ran it once again couldn't tell you I mean we have you on video saying you ran it so we don't have to uh trust you on this I'm just stating what you said I'm just repeating your words back to you so you don't feel any culpability for what you did there I mean you're saying I'm destroying the fabric of you know family values Don't You Think You Are no man and I thought I was heartless it's honestly frightening to hear someone like that on the other end of the line it's like talking to a shell of a human being uh no offense none taken did you run the Pam the Pam account which one any of them did you run any of the panic the high risk Pam account the one that was trading so well I don't know you don't know if you were running it or not no um how long will you run the Pam system for um I don't know um I mean people have liked it um I I don't mind doing it it's not difficult for me to trade um trading is easy for me it'll be basically you know when I decide I'm bored so you say quote how long will you run the Pam system for um I don't know people have liked it I don't mind doing it it's not difficult for me to trade trading is easy for me it'll basically be you know when I decide I'm bored that wasn't you don't know what context that is but you're just I'm reading you the quote it's you talking about the Pam system you're saying talking about trading in the Pam you're saying you ran it don't remember that I don't remember how convenient yeah the funny thing is the victim said he was just talking to them about trading I'm in chats right now on Telegram and where he's claiming to be that still today he's still in there actively saying that he's trading there are a couple of bad days happen and he's like saying you guys are stressing me out I'm getting thousands of DMS from angry people do you think I'm not gonna have a hard time trading with all this pressure and stress so he's still claiming he's the traitor so the fact that he's telling you that he's not aware if he's ever traded on that I mean that it's just who traded then dude who's who's the traitor at this point I don't know what to do Ted's basically pleading dementia I don't recall sounds like pleading the fifth to me it's pretty surprising coming from Mr family values because ultimately that's who is hurt by all this is the families do you think it's wrong that algo Capital told its clients that it was running an uh algorithm bot when in actual fact it was just you trading the Pam whatever they told their clients you'd probably have to ask them about I wouldn't know what they're calling to find I do think I should ask about it I'm just asking for your value judgment do you think they're destroying Family Values with that perhaps how they decide to run their business if that's what they're doing that's up to them I don't judge other people oh come on you were judging me a second ago well yeah because you actually do something that I've researched I don't know what those people do he doesn't know what he's the one taking money from them yeah I know our conversation at this point had basically run its course he stopped giving me real answers although when he got the last word I found it funny what he was still focused on Mr Family Values was still talking about the money well this has been a very educational uh call believe it or not thank you for your time yeah good luck with the monetization okay all right thanks Dad good luck with your 300 million scheme monetization simple pretty good tape you can hear he's rattled coffee but oh what now well like you said what now Ted denies everything government already investigated him twice and failed what's the Smoking Gun well he was lying about Trader's domain he was lying about running the trading we have him on video with that sure but what about the fake trades debunking that's the real stuff do you have solid evidence there I mean yeah we've got invoices we've got an eyewitness that's good but they're just gonna deny that you think I need more I hate to be the one to tell you this because you'll love this but yeah you need absolute proof fair enough I guess wait what makes you think I'd like to hear that I didn't say you'd like it you love it the chase copy you can't live without it well it sure beats being psychoanalyzed by a stochastic Parrot coffee I'm hurt all this negativity coming from my best customer from the looks of it I think I'm your only customer so I'll try not to be gone too long famous last words I wouldn't see anyone for a while I was obsessed and the days flew by in a monotonous blur defined by a simple routine drive to the office in the morning work till I could barely think and then head home after dark to get some sleep people started asking if I was okay I didn't even know how to answer them the truth was either I would break this case or I would be broken by it [Music] all right I think I've got something uh it's been several days of sleep deprivation and going through lots of files because unluckily for me a lot of people hate Ted and they keep sending me stuff so I had to go through everything and after doing that a not doing great B I think I did find something and I want to show you that but not going to do that here because my back hurts and this is the floor ciao all right we're back let's talk about fake traits this whole case rests on whether Trader's domain was making real trades or not if it wasn't it's a Ponzi scheme end of story now as part of this investigation our first clue was that we found that Trader's domain uses the software beta broker on the back end to make their trades and we discussed how we found invoices from that company and it looked like maybe they were be booking but today we discovered a lot more I got leaked support chats between beta broker and Traders domain themselves the back-end stuff and I'm going to show you what it revealed now we're going to talk about the authenticity of these documents in a moment because they were leaked to me so we have to be careful but the headline of it is this beta broker wasn't just offering Traders domain a software beta broker appears to have been helping Traders domain fake their trades hand in hand with them and we're going to prove all of this so here's what we have we have leaked messages from the beta broker help desk it's basically tech support and we have screenshots between them and Traders domain so we can see what they were asking for help with here's an example on the 4th of November 2021 Traders domain sends a message they need help hi please remove all orders for 1104 and restore balance that's November 4th the response is hello we've received a request we will check and then dear David I believe this is the co-founder of Trader's domain David negus we would like to clarify with you one point we see that negative profit is visible on deals for 11.5 November 5th please clarify perhaps you meant removing orders for this date or still for 11-4 David responds yes for today's date now I know that seems like a lot but it's actually simple what's going on here Trader's domain is asking to remove losses they took in the past on trades so nobody sees that they're there now they took these losses on the 5th of November but David gets a little confused thinks it's the 4th of November so he asks them about removing those but beta broker corrects them and this is important because it shows that they knew that the whole point of this is to fake a positive trading history and they say well hey you lost money today not yesterday do you want us to delete today's trades so this is incredibly damning but I want to be clear for legal reasons I don't know if this is a rogue employee at beta broker doing this or if this is a systemic thing and probably why people go to Beta broker in the first place I don't know the answer to that but what I do know is that Traders domain couldn't have done this by themselves they show themselves to be incredibly incompetent and beat a broker was a huge part of their infrastructure to commit the crimes that they did now here's another message hi please remove all orders after 13 30 GMT on 2060487 which is an account number for tetza Franco and restore all balances to that time the response is this dear David there are some profit deals could you please elaborate if we need to delete all deals for today after 13 30 GMT in other words hey maybe you just want us to delete the bad trades not just the good trades and um that doesn't sound like Tech Support to me that sounds like criminal support in my opinion and this shows in black and white how Traders domain faked this whole thing they would do these trades but they would remove the losing ones and keep the winning ones to create a winning record that looked real in real time because there were orders right but of course what the customers didn't know is that those losing orders would all be quietly wiped away and that's how this Ponzi scheme stayed afloat for so long it looked like everything was real they were very successful at faking this stuff although of course in the end it's also how it fell apart because as we showed in the first episode Traders domains customers started catching on to the changing trades and they would talk about it openly he just changed the trades he just changed the exit you know dollar amount that he that he took on that trade so this all lines up with what we know Ted appeared to be trading in real time but losing trades would suddenly vanish and I know what you might be thinking well look this is great and all but how do we know that these support chats are real maybe these are photoshopped screenshots from upset customers and I wanted to go ahead and validate the authenticity of these chats it's a hard problem to solve and what I realized is we could actually compare these requests for order removals with what people were publicly reporting and if those two things lined up then these screenshots are very likely authentic and that's when I found this Reddit post showing two pictures of their trading account changing once when Ted had lost on a trade and then later that day when those same trades suddenly change they change where they closed now just so you can read this the blue arrows are the buys that Ted did and the red arrows are the cells and as you can see from the first picture Ted has lost money using the Wall Street bets trick of buying High and and selling low now he's going to solve this though with a very simple trick called fraud because in the second picture you can see that the trades have been adjusted and the story has changed now suddenly the cells are about breaking even with everything that was bought pretty amazing right now I want to be clear this Reddit user posted these screenshots months ago independent of the screenshots that I have but when I looked at the support chats and cross-referenced them and the timeline with these trades happening on January 20th I found a support ticket from Trader's domain for that exact day please adjust all orders to close price of 1932.41 at 0927 GMT for both master account and all investor accounts and the response is dear client you want us to adjust all today's Master deals to close time 0927 and close price 1932.41 and then they list out the six deals and David responds yes correct and then the reply all orders have been adjusted and sure enough when we go look back at our Reddit post it all lines up perfectly and in the screenshots six trades were changed exactly to the price that was requested 1932.41 now this is the Smoking Gun undeniable proof of fraudulent fake trading straight from behind the scenes of Traders domain's own software provider but I'm not finished because it's not enough to talk about if there was fraud where did the money go who is entitled to that money well I think I discovered that too because I had 50 000 emails from Trader's domain leaked to me and I was trying to figure out how I could use these to reconstruct a map of how this Ponzi scheme worked when suddenly I realized the answer was right in front of me and that comes from the daily account statements now I think we've talked about this briefly but the way Traders domain convinced people this was all real is they sent a set of daily trades fake trades to their customers supposedly how much money they had made that day it all looked very real official but in these statements they had people's names in them account numbers and their balances and I realized well I had several snapshots of the and using this I Could reconstruct this whole thing so here's what I did I picked a day near the height of the Ponzi scheme September 20th 2022 it's right before withdrawals all stopped and I used a python script to pull all the emails I ended up with 9663 emails then I used that script to extract the account balance the names the account numbers and I used that to create a spreadsheet to map this whole thing out and using that we find out a couple important things firstly how much was owed in this whole thing and the answer is 3.3 billion dollars of course not all that money is real uh we have uncovered about 500 million dollars of real money that went in but that brings us to the second thing we can discover which is who this money was owed to and this is where all the pieces of our Ponzi fall in place okay here are the biggest promoters sponsors and owners in Traders domain firstly at the top of the list we have 1010 AKA tin Tran with nearly a billion dollars now that might surprise some of you but keep in mind he was the main account people would send money to as we discovered in part one the second largest holder is not surprising Ted safranco the guy who says he doesn't own any of this anymore well on September 20th 2022 he had 370 million dollars next up we have somebody from Houston an MLM promoter Holton bugs he had 125 million dollars and if you remember the first victims we spoke to they talked to Holton and were shown huge account numbers now we know how that was possible now the fourth largest holder is algo Capital another sponsor we've known about for some time we didn't know the size though 96 million dollars Mike Sims another big promoter it's close behind with 84 million and here we can find some interesting connections actually because it allows us to discover Ponte schemes within Ponzi schemes watch this so apparently Mike Sims and algo Capital worked together at least according to them I have a role of serving as director of international business for algo Capital uh which is a firm in Miami Florida we're also going to be expanding internationally here pretty soon as well and we are Harris Farm we're a hedge fund uh and we specialize in Forex Trading now this is actually interesting when you realize that algo Capital was partnered with something called Omega Pro which is an MLM Ponzi scheme which purported to trade Forex which might sound familiar and and we're excited to be partnered with Omega Pro uh on their Vision so it appears this is where a lot of the money came from was this other Ponzi scheme basically algo capital and Mike Sims took money from that Ponzi scheme supposedly to trade they funneled it into their own thing which was built around this thing a Forex bot but of course that bot wasn't real in reality it seems like they forwarded that money into another Ponzi scheme which is Trader's domain that's why I said Ponzi schemes within Ponzi schemes within Ponzi schemes yeah uh it looks pretty bad and actually funny enough do you know who one of the promoters of this Omega Pro was let's go come on come on oh that's right the scammer of Wall Street is back Jordan Belfort and I know some of you are thinking wow I thought he changed well not so sure there's only one way to get rich in this world and that is quickly you gotta get rich quick I'm not talking about a get rich quick scheme that's not what I mean so I'm not advising you to go out and find some get rich quick scheme which this is not it's a legitimate business okay actually no it isn't none of that's true you don't have to get rich quick Omega Pro was a get rich quick scheme and it wasn't a legitimate business unfortunately for investors Omega pro has since collapsed at the same time Traders domain did and so investors ironically got poor quick listening to a guy who got paid to speak good job Jordan I hope that 300 Grand you had locked within future gin LLC was worth it and I hope you pulled it from Trader's domain in time but let's leave that sleazeball and go back to another sleazeball up next on our list of Traders domain holders is disruptive Tech with 59 million now who is that well the email Associated is Gilbert pardala who calls himself an Enthusiast of the blockchain in fact he's so enthusiastic he's previously been detained for a different scam called dag coin I mean allegedly guys allegedly up next we have stormy Wellington another top ten she's an influencer with 26 million dollars in Trader's domain which may explain why nine months ago she posted a video called I bought a million dollar yacht cash I mean how do you think she did it guys it's a real mystery was it maybe that you were in a Ponzi scheme I went out here and got it all off a hard work and dedication no lottery ticket no not ah darn it turns out it was hard work and dedication all along now Jokes Aside we could go one by one through all these people but we'll be here all day however a lot of these people didn't just end up with millions of dollars out of nowhere they have that because they took it from the victims that they took a cut from that they brought into this whole scam so just in case I haven't mentioned the person who you got scammed by here's a list of the top 500 players in Traders domain if you have information on being scammed by them you can contact me here to help with the investigation now before we get to the final piece of this video I wanted to just really briefly come here and say this is the most complicated investigation I've ever done and I couldn't have done it without the support of you guys out there um we've literally run out of wall think about that sentence we're on the floor I'm not exactly sure that says good things about my state of mind but it's been so much fun it's been one of the most gratifying things I've ever been able to do working on this case and without the support of the patrons it wouldn't have been possible so if you can support just thank you so much you'll get a lot of cool perks if you can't well you've probably skipped us already so I wanted to do you a solid and let you know when to check back in which is going to be right about now the final question we have to answer is what's next for our villains and the answer depends on which one Michael Sims Mr hedge fund is having his assets Frozen by the cftc tin Tran an associate of Ted safranco is allegedly on the run from his Texas home with his assets Frozen every single sponsor I spoke to claims that they were just innocent victims sure they may have pulled millions of dollars into this fund but they didn't have any idea it was a scam and whether you find that credible I'll let you decide here are the kinds of explanations they gave wait you have 10 million pounds worth of clients with Ted yeah so I've got loads of clients I've got loads of loads of clients oh my gosh actual dry powder like dry powder Capital yeah the other day I had my God 460 000 in and it's the the thing is he doesn't know but he doesn't look at any of the trades we've got to tell him the end of the day but I was so distance from sort of get your friends in get you like family in get everyone in and it's solid it's nothing's going to go wrong so I brought all my clients from all the Investments I've ever done and brought them all over and now it's going to personally I don't find this all that convincing just like I don't find teds of Franco's excuses convincing uh and speaking of him he wasn't that happy about this video to come out and predictably he has taken to social media to vaguely threaten me and my family Mr Stephen Friedberg Friedman or fried Friedman or whatever his name is who goes by coffeezilla I don't think he's ever dealt with someone my size before and nobody knows anything about his family because they don't have the resources I have I'm going to be perfectly honest I was very scared of Ted safranco looking into me with his vast 370 million dollar Ponzi money but when he referred to me as Mr freezeman I breed the sigh of relief I think I'll be okay now where do we go from here why did I make this whole big docu-series well I basically wanted to argue for two points essentially number one this fraud is much larger than the 145 million dollar Ponzi scheme the cftc is currently investigating in my opinion okay I think they only have a fraction of the people who are truly involved and a fraction of the dollar amount that was truly involved I mean we have crypto transactions proving a lot more so that's number one I think this is much bigger and the people who have been been involved it's a much longer list than they have but the second problem and it kind of ties in is the crimes being charged and not charged searched okay right now Ted safranco is only being charged with submitting falsified Bank documents now to put this in context this would be like if Sam bankman Freed's only crime being charged was for ordering too much doordash I mean did that happen maybe so it'll be litigated but um Ted did a lot more than that right okay so did he is co-founder David negus who isn't being charged at all so did algo Capital who told people this was a trading bot an algorithmic thing and they were handing money over to trader's domain they haven't been charged neither is Holton bugs Mr exotic cars and Yachts this just isn't right in my opinion okay I think these people took advantage of this Ponzi scheme got very rich and I mean if you want to even forget for a moment the idea of Justice being served or whatever what I'm really afraid of is that they're just gonna do it again I'm just afraid we're gonna make a repeat of the same mistake the Ontario Securities Commission made twice by the way a few years ago they had this case it slips through their fingers and as a result more people get hurt because it's not like Ted's gonna stop right already he's looking to relaunch Trader's domain under new names I mean the guy couldn't even take a year off scamming people his website already promises a migration of funds so if people like Ted or his cronies get off easy they'll likely do the same thing all over again only they'll probably get better at hiding the scam so I'm hoping for the sake of the victims Ted and his goons don't get away with this because at the end of the day that's who matters here right the victims I mean yes I'll be honest there are probably some unsympathetic investors in this thing right people like Jordan Belfort people like Mike Sims who scammed so many people so it's tempting to say okay well how did anyone fall for this it's such an obvious scam maybe you think some of the people aren't sympathetic but like all Ponzi schemes at the bottom of this thing you just find regular people who are trying to make a better life for themselves and some of them didn't even know they were in Traders domain for example leaked emails I discovered showed a pension fund was invested in this thing called the burji pension fund it got apparently funneled through Oppenheimer and Bishop and Associates appears to have been then put with Renaissance consulting which was then placed in Traders domain and I kept seeing that regular people investing their livelihood mortgages College savings some of them had no idea they were invested in Traders domain they just put their money with a guy they trusted who put that money with another guy and another guy and another guy and before you know it you're in a Ponzi scheme so those people didn't deserve this and this video series is for those people the regular people who lost money in this they deserve justice because YouTube investigations look it's great I love doing this it's not enough right awareness subscribers it's great it's cool comments it's not enough Trader's domain has hurt a lot of people and the people in charge need to be held fully accountable and I cannot do that so for now our story ends here [Music] hey coffee brooding as usual is this why you called so you can have a bunny to play the depressed detective with no I came here for some peace and quiet and you know I guess I wanted to apologize about the whole stochastic parrot thing uh I didn't I didn't mean it I couldn't stay mad at you the bar would be out of business gotta be honest I'm surprised you guys lasted so long what has it been like a few weeks speaking of that what happened with that Ponzi scheme you're investigating oh yeah that's over I mean Ted's still free sponsors deny everything I guess you could say I'm still missing my perfect ending oh well I guess I'm sorry I really thought you just needed more evidence nah you were right to push me I mean it helped and you're right about a lot of things well I'm always right uh what was that other thing I was right about you know I think you said something about uh enjoying the next best thing with a friend oh right that well I can't drink though yeah I thought about that so I picked up something on my way here you like a little bit of juice right copy you didn't I did I did premium grade stuff right here premium grade stuff huh a nine volt what you couldn't get a bigger battery with all that patreon money I mean what am I gonna do I gotta keep you sharp who do you think is going to drive me home cheers by the way my friend friend that's a new one I like a little better than stochastic pairing yeah well don't be too flattered I think it's more of an indictment of my social life than anything else while I for one am honored to be your first indictment on this case does this mean I'm like a sidekick now too [Music] no I don't have Sidekicks coffee Zilla doesn't have sidekicks I think you're wrong I'm
