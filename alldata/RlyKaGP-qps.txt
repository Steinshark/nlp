jQuery 4.0 is officially upon us as of what is today today's the seventh as of yesterday thank you Timmy by the way appreciate it Timmy um I'm going to tell a couple stories about my jQuery days okay I do love that when I zoom in that this image becomes a little bit blurry okay I'm not going to lie to you there's something about jQuery and the fact that I did that just makes my heart just warm anyways jQuery 4.0 uh has been in the works for a long time but it is now ready for Beta release there's a lot to cover and the team is excited to see it released we've got bug fixes performance improvements and some breaking changes we removed support for less than ie1 right is that what that means for IE less than 11 yeah uh after all is that but I I wonder if there's like an equal to here do they still support ie11 after all we still expect disruption to be minimal uh many of the breaking changes are ones the team has wanted to make for years but couldn't in a patch or minor release we've trimmed Legacy code removed some previously deprecated apis removed some internal only parameters to public functions that were never documented Ed and dropped support for some magic behaviors that were overly complicated how amazing is this by the way like honestly what people don't know so I I'm sure there's a bunch of people that are just piling in right now going why are we looking at jQuery why are we even talking about jQuery can I tell you something that might hurt your feelings a little bit most of the web runs jQuery you know and so by making jQuery better there's a huge amount of people that have to live in Legacy forever that are absolutely happy about this if you can make a just a huge portion of people very happy there's more jQuery sites than react just think about that for a second it's hard to think about in from modern tech perspective on Twitter but it's like literally is the truth 75% my bad it's 75% yeah who will update though that's a great question jQuery 4.0 dropped support for IE 10 and older uh some may be asking why we didn't remove support for ie1 we plan to remove by the way HDMX htx 2 remove support for i11 I just want you guys to do that flip cut that part out flip cut that previous part out as an ie user I'm crying right now if you're using IE10 you're you're you you have some Mor morally questionable Behavior I want you to know that I'm just I'm just letting you know that if you use IE10 I think you're a bad person you're you're being an uh sub be asking why we didn't remove support for i1 we plan to remove support in stages uh and the next step will happen in jQuery 5 they're already planning jQuery 5 damn I am shook right now I'm shook ie1 will be removed in 2034 when they actually have a time a Time issue it'll be it'll be 2036 it'll be 2036 when they have a Time problem uh for now we will start removing code specifically supporting IE versions older than 11 giving us a large reduction of a uh 8 let's see 867 gzipped bytes in one PR sh that's a lot damn I dude I know this is not okay hold on you know hold on hold on there's a tweet here people we got a tweet we got a tweet here we got a tweet here everyone everyone just sit down modern web uh development cannot uh mind cannot compreh comprehend why this is amazing like you can't you like can't why is this amazing well in the in the bygone day in the bygone days of your um let's go like this uh jQuery uh let's see uh what's it called uh gzip size let's see if we have that so gzipped so when someone does this they're reducing the overall size of the library by what 2% two and a half percent and this is old jQuery so let's see it go down because I'm sure as as time goes on hopefully jQuery went down in size Gip it's actually gone up in size which is a bit shocking minified with oh this is minified oh we didn't even have that what do you mean who doesn't Minify and then gzip what is this okay so it's it's look at that uh 29 29475 29475 which means that it literally that is like 4% reduction in size I want to see I wish I could see some jQuery like larger ones anyways look at this minified and gzipped 20 29.7 that puts it into like 20 28 that's crazy that's crazy it's getting better it is getting better that's a huge proportional size you got remember that when you're doing this kind of stuff you're going for as little as possible every single time you have to send another packet you have another opportunity for a packet drop things just slow down if the smaller and smaller you can create a library the better and the better and so these are big wins when you're at this size right this is a big win when you're at at that size all right so I want to do like a quick quick little chitty chat about this um it is it's really it's really really important uh no changes should be required in your end if you uh if you need to support any of these browsers simply stick with J cury 3 awesome right awesome yeah dash9 yeah I'm going to kill that going to kill it all right anyways these functions have been deprecated let's see flip start here these functions have been deprecated for several versions it's time to remove them nice look at all that parse Json how crazy is that how is function is window damn son damn look at all these look at all those man so dude look focusing dude you focusing today you focusing today it's actually kind of it's kind of wild that there's there's so much the browser has taken from the usage of jQuery that made it better you know what I mean back in the day we needed those oh yeah they were very very important but now it's just like natively supported which is just awesome there's a whole bunch of stuff I just wanted to say some things about jQuery I know there's like a bunch of stuff that they're doing right and they have all this cool stuff that they're doing that's that's absolutely you know amazing and all that and and there's a huge things uh the Mastadon part wish you you wish you were on Twitter you know you you'd actually be able to tweet about it but uh something that I think is really really misunderstood about jQuery especially in today's modern world is just like how hard web development was back in the day back in the day web development there was no unified way on being able to do almost anything okay so if you wanted to fade something in and out you may have to do that via JavaScript you may be able to do that via CSS you may be able to do it this way or that way it was actually really hard to do anything ever there you had to like to do any of these Fades you had to you had to paste in like the webkit version the mosa version you had to paste in the Safari version you had to paste in like every last one of them if you want the fade things in and out it was just super difficult if you wanted rounded edges it was super difficult if you wanted anything it was super difficult to be able to like even just have three uh three floating elements all centered within a viewport was hard you had to learn all about floats and clear fixes and how to actually do floats properly that would work across the board and jQuery do jQuery revolutionized a huge portion of this and made it incredibly simple if you don't have appreciation that they're still making the web better I feel like you are just missing out on a lot of stuff right and this is a good it's a good thing to remember that you should maybe consider taking a little trip out somewhere else you know what I mean taking a trip out and going and checking out some of the older ways to do things I think you'll be a lot happier and and things will be a lot better honestly I'm going to pause that song that song sucked and just just go try it out go build something with without react or anything and see see what you get and be like oh wow okay yeah that's that's that was neat then imagine having a bunch of if statements separating out every possible type of browser trying to figure out which type of browser it was think about having if statements to determine what type of XML HTTP request you're going to make and then all of a sudden you get dollar signed get like imagine how crazy that was when you had to have like so many different ways to handle a request and then all the sudden you get like you get dollar signed get or dollar sign post and it's like you're just like oh my goodness dude HX options were so good being able to actually do patch and delete dude it was out of this world and so I just wanted to at least just celebrate and say hey good job jQuery you know like real talk I'm not going to use you I like I you know I I it's not it's not my wheelhouse anymore but I wanted to say amazing job and I I'm I love to see you're still making the world a better place and you know I don't like the fact that you are making the world a better place more than I am like I don't like that but I'm happy that you're doing it and so good job just little like hey celebratory thing you can go check out all the things they're doing they're just I mean Pro probably most of these things you don't even understand because you just you use a library that takes out most of the stuff that you're seeing right here right it just takes it all out so you just you're you're hidden behind layers of abstraction this is giving you the raw dog and elements here okay the name is I loved jQuery I absolutely loved it I still look back on it with such fond fond it was perfect it was perfect a Jen
