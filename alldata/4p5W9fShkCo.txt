hi everyone in this video we're going to be setting up some simple animations for the sword and shield so the first thing we need to do is just attach these to the hands and we could do this by just parenting them directly to the hand bones but I have for a little bit more control I'm going to be creating an additional bone coming out of each of these hand bones just so that we can sort of move and rotate the items that the character is holding without having to affect the hand itself so I'm going to go into edit mode on the rig and grip resti and just make sure the x-axis mirror is on here in the armature options so that when I select this little joint here of the hand bone and extrude that out you can see it gets married on the other side as well I'll select that bone press alt P and just disconnect it so it's still Parenthood just we can move it out of it if we want and I need to go into the bone properties here and I'll call this one hand hold dot left and this one hand hold dot right okay now I want to grab the sword and just position that so that the origin of this object is at the head of the hand hold bone here so I mean to go into pose mode with ctrl tab and select the bone shift s cursor to selected and then I'll select the sword object shift s and say selection takasi to parent it on our shift right click to select that hand hold bone ctrl P and set parent to bone so now you can see we can rotate and move this bone around to manipulate the sword and since that's parented to the hand bone oops that's the finger that works as well okay let's do the same thing for the shield so select hand hold left this is again in pose mode shift s cursor is selected and then select the shield object shift s and selection to cursor I very quickly want to turn the shield into a single object somebody's going to select this little cross and in the modifiers I'll just apply all of these and then shift select the shield ctrl J to merge that into a single object and then to parent this to the hand hold burn so just shift select that bone control P set parent okay so with that done I will drag out another window for my animation view here set that to dopesheet and change the mode to action editor and I want to create a single frame grip animation for each of these hands so create a new action call this grip right and press the F key there to just make sure that gets saved and I'm going to come into front orthographic view and just grab this hand hold bone and just sort of Nestle the sword into the palm of the hand there and now I'll rotate the fingers to close around it and press control three to go into the left side view and just rotate this so that it's not clipping at all there and then I'll grab the lower fingers and just rotate those as well and from the side share may be good you need to bring the hand hold bone a little bit forward on the y-axis to make some room for the thumb I'll just position that something like so okay so once we're happy with that we can just select these hand bones here and with the active keying set set to location and rotation I'll press I to insert the keyframes now it doesn't matter if you insert keyframes for any of these other bones how this is going to work is whenever the character is holding something in his right hand will play this grip animation on top of all other animations but with a mask applied so that only these hand bones that we care about are affected okay let's do a similar thing for the shield hand so I'm just gonna close this action create a new one called and grip left save that and I'll just select his hand bones press ctrl C to copy the pose and then shift ctrl V to paste that over to this other hand and I'm gonna select the handhold burn Miska rotate this around the z-axis like so and just orient the shield roughly like this it's not actually modeled in but you can imagine some sort of straps holding the shield in place all right and I'll select those bones and I to insert the keyframe okay the next thing I'd like to do is create some sort of Idol combat stance so I need to enable the armor and I'll create a new action called maybe combat under school idol I'll save that and okay let's maybe put this one foot forward bring the body down can maybe be facing a little bit sideways and I bring this foot back so it's ready to lunge forwards I have this sword at the ready the head should still be looking straight forward say yes and the shields can be up so just something roughly like that I think is okay maybe just rotate the hand a bit so the sword isn't quite so wonky and I just rotate the body slightly forwards okay I'm gonna insert a keyframe for that and then I just like to add some slight up-down motion to the body so we'll come forward 20 or so frames and just bring the hips down a little bit and maybe add some subtle rotation to the arms as well just like this perhaps and then select everything in such a keyframe and now I want to go back to how it was at the start so I'll try to click on this first column of keyframes shift D to duplicate that and I want to shift this over to frame 39 all right I'll end set the end frame here to thirty-eight press all today to play and obviously this is a very crude animation but he does look like he's ready for battle okay let's now move on to our first attack animation so I'll close this action create a new one called something like I get a sword attack one and save that and on the first frame I'll add a keyframe for this idle pose and then go forward say nine or ten frames and I basically just want the sword arm to swing back over the shoulder the shield will come up a bit and then as the sword slashes down it's going to take a step forwards and the shield will swing back so let me start by raising this arm up a bit I'll DoubleTap R so I can freely rotate this lower arm back rotate the hand as well something like this okay maybe the shoulder needs to come back slightly and can also just rotate the whole body more sideways to get a get some more force behind the swing alright rotate the head back so that remains roughly forwards and at this point it's probably a good idea to actually turn on the blender a p' so that we can get an idea of whether or not we're clipping through the mesh so I'll quickly set all these values to one here okay so a little bit of an intersection there and bit of an intersection with the elbow so you could try and trick this somehow but I don't think I'm going to be able to get the exact pose that I want without any clipping here so I mean it's not a big deal even at this late stage to modify the mesh slightly I'll quickly go into edit mode and it will add in two loop cuts just along there and to that quickly press T and enable my X mirror so I just want to grab these two loops although tap cheat edge slide these more to the center and then alt s just puff them out a bit now if we go back into object mode that is doing a better job of concealing it's still showing a little bit I'll just puffer out slightly more yeah it's still there but I mean okay we could also modify the shape key but for now I'm just gonna leave that it's not very noticeable I touch it up later all right so I'm also going to make the character leaned back a bit something like that and want to raise up the shield I think that's looking pretty good so I'll insert a keyframe for that first pose this sword is maybe at a bit of a funny angle I'll just rotate the hand of it and update the keyframe coming forward a another couple of frames I'm now going to create the next pose so what the character to have stepped forward z' like so he'll now be rotated more in the other direction it's a very funky pose maybe this foot can be straight forwards like so and I guess what's going on is you need to actually move both of these knee targets all right can maybe roll up onto the ball of the foot yeah okay lean forwards and I'll rotate this some more rotate the head back and it'll just reset the rotation on the arm here so I can bring that down into the final striking pose bring that across the body slightly since it is going to be a sort of slash like this and have a look at that from the side I'll reset the rotation on these two armbands yeah that looks okay so yes this is roughly what I want I'll select all of those and set a keyframe and let's just have a look at how that's going so I would definitely like this foot to lift off the ground instead of just sliding forwards so I guess roughly halfway through just rotate it forwards a little bit lift it off the ground and maybe the body can raise up slightly for that step so I'll set a keyframe on those two bones and then on this second last frame I can prepare for the foot to come down like so okay now one thing I want to pay attention to is the path of the sword or if you want this to be a nice smooth arc so to help visualize this I'm going to go into edit mode on the armature and I want to add a temporary bone that comes to the tip of the soldier so I'm going to select this handhold bone and from side view I'll just extrude this out you know you go into wireframe mode so I can just position that a bit more precisely and then I don't want this one that's been narrative onto the shield side so I'll just press T turn off the x-axis mirror and then delete that all right since I extruded this from the head of the handhold bone it's not actually Parenthood so I may actually select this shift select the handle bone ctrl P and parent keeping the offset then going into pose mode in the armature panel here we have this motion path section and I'm interested in seeing motion paths from frame 9 onwards so with just this sword bone selected I'm going to set the display range to 9 and say calculate okay so now we can see the path that the sword is following and so if we look at this from the side and think well actually we want this to be a little bit higher well we could maybe come forward a few frames and lift up the arm like so insert keyframes on that and then the path doesn't update automatically unfortunately we have to select the sorbonne and manually ask it to update the paths so I'm just going to continue tweaking this for a bit at the start of the swing here I'd like to round this out of it so I'll lift the arm up a tiny bit over here and maybe on this frame as well and let me update that that looks better then I don't really like the abrupt change in direction here I'll try smooth that out slightly so on this frame maybe the arm can be a little bit wider out and I'll tweak that on the last frame as well let's update that that looks more like it there's a bit of a funny change in direction here so maybe this can come in a bit like that let me update that look at this from the top maybe get a better idea of what's going on all right no I want to grab the hand bone so that we can adjust the the angle that the sword is being held and of course we want this to be sort of in the same direction that the sword is moving so between these two frames we can see the sword is moving in this direction so we want the sword sort of aligned with that the frustrating thing of course is that as you change the angle of the hand the path itself changes so it can feel a bit like you're chasing your own tail but if we keep tweaking this we'll get there eventually let me update that and I think this is time to look fine we can of course press this Alexia to get rid of the path just see how it looks without that and okay it's still looking a little bit rough but in the interest of time gonna call that acceptable and move on so last thing I wanna do for this animation is just getting the character returning back to his initial pose so I'll alt right click on this first column of keyframes shift D and move that out to about frame 30 see now it jacks and slides back don't have to slide back immediately though so gonna grab this leg I K you can see it highlighted here in the dope sheet summary just grab this keyframe shift D to duplicate it I'll just move that out a couple more frames to hold it in place you can see it weights a little bit before returning to its original position and I'll come to sort of the middle of these two keyframes here and I'm gonna lift this foot up a bit so it's not just sliding along the ground like so and I'll position the hips just like above the leg and a little bit higher up and set keyframes on both of those bones so I was taking a step back let's also then look at this from the front and here I don't really like how the angle of the sword changes at the end of the strike here so I'm going to find the hand bone and just duplicate that last keyframe move it out same as we did with the foot and now that keeps its orientation for a little bit one last very quick adjustment I wanna make is just to this foot here if I go into the first frame and position the 3d cursor just at the tip of the toes you can see that this is actually sliding back quite a lot so I'll just quickly adjust this so that the tip of the toe is remaining inside the 3d cursor though just something like that should be a lot better okay I'm going to call this animation done for now and move on to creating a lunge attack now I can reuse a lot of this animation for that so instead of creating a new action from scratch I'll just press this too to duplicate this I'll save it and call this attack too and I want to delete these key frames here for the right arm and hand bones so can now come here I'll reset the rotation and from front view quickly hide the shield that's blocking my view and just get this arm pointing forwards like so and from side view I'll get the swinging back a bit and I don't think the body is going to lean back so much for this one all right so I'll insert a keyframe for that and then here the arms doing very strange things or reset the rotation and just position this how I want so the hand can just rotate dance that the sword is pointing forwards okay on such a frame for that now currently the arm is sort of swinging around in this weird arc and it should just come straight forward so we're gonna have to add in some key frames in between to just keep this rotating down by the side of the body and keep the sword straight okay as the sword comes back I don't want him to slice through his own leg if possible okay so just got to tweak these things that the arm doesn't sort of wave back and forth in a weird way having should counteract some of the rotation of the body here which is making it a bit awkward but if we go through this frame by frame we can get it how we want and all right let me go to object mode so I can bring the shield back and just make sure that this looks okay together and I think that's looking fine okay last animation on tikrit is just a little punch animation for when the character doesn't have a weapon equipped so quickly hide the sword and the shield and you can also delete or hide this sword burn recreated and I'm also gonna go to work from the first attack animation as a base so I'll duplicate that call this punch and save it and then go to pose mode and on this first punch pose can maybe just lean back a little bit less and can adjust this arm want the palm of the hand to be facing sort of more towards the ground so can rotate that like so I think that's looking ok so I will insert a frame that quickly delete these intermediate arm and hand key frames and then go forward to this next major frame and here lift up the shoulder and we do want the palm of the hand facing downwards so I'm going to rotate this along the y-axis something like that and then rotate this one a little bit more okay so it's not facing down and I just bring this across the body slightly bring the shoulder forward and maybe this arm can come back even further here all right I might actually rotate the arm a bit less but then instead rotate the upper body a bit more not transferring a keyframe for that and I think that's looking ok so that is going to be everything for this episode until next time Cheers
