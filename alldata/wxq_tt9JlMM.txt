hi everyone in this episode we'll be creating a simple run cycle so just like the walk cycle last episode we're going to start and end with the contact pose where the front foot is striking the ground in between these two will come the passing position where the one leg is just swung past the leg on the ground directly after the first contact pose comes the down pose the lowest point in the run and then there's an in-between frame before the passing position after the passing position comes the up position the highest point in the run where the character uses their back leg to essentially launch themselves off the ground following this is one frame where the character has both legs off the ground before we reach the next contact pose this completes a single step in the run so obviously this needs to be mirrored for the second step to complete the run cycle so we can start by getting the same window set up from last episode we'll just drag out from the top right here go to the dopesheet and choose action editor and here we've got one action at the moment the walk cycle that we created so we're going to close that by pressing a little X button here and create a new action and we'll call this run and as before we'll just press this little F key over here to make sure that that gets saved and we can also zoom in a bit on our timeline here it's going to be a six frame cycle so we only need to see the first 13 or so frames to see the whole thing let's start by creating our first contact pose so I'm going to stretch the blue leg out a little bit more and then bring the whole body down so that the foot can actually reach the ground you can then just press alt R to clear the rotation on the green tosya and just stretch the whole green leg back can maybe grab the hips and just make the character lean into the run a little bit and then the blue leg is forward so of course the blue arm is going to be here back and the green arm will be forwards so from front view can maybe double tap our to enter the strap or rotation mode and just rotate the arms across the chest slightly do the same with the hands and we can really rotate the chest bone itself just a little bit across like so and then the head is going to want to try and remain as stable as possible so we can rotate that back to its upright position alright we're going to want to grab the foot here and just move it across the x-axis so that it's a little bit more in line with the center so that the character is sort of maintaining his balance a little bit better can then select all of those bones and press I to insert our first keyframe remember this is set to location and rotation as our default from the last episode then going ahead six frames to frame seven we're going to want to paste the mirror of this pose so just press control C shift control V or use these buttons at the bottom here and then press I to insert that keyframe so we can press alt a to preview this so far it doesn't look like much at the moment so let's go to the middle frame frame four and create our passing position so here the blue leg should still be on the ground so let's grab that move it down there is zoom in and zoom in here a little bit let's rotate the toes maybe enter wireframe mode see this a bit better just want these to be flat on the ground alright and then the green leg is passing the blue leg at this point can maybe bring the whole body up a little bit alright let's insert a keyframe for that and let's go back to frame two for our down position so here we want the foot to be flat on the ground remove this back of it and the whole body is going to come down sort of absorbing the impact of the landing alright insert a keyframe for that we've then got our in-between position just want to make sure that the leg the foot rather is flat on the ground here and set the keyframe that's looking good so then our up position the toes should be touching the ground as the character sort of launches himself into the air we want the whole body to come as high up as possible while maintaining this sort of slight bend in the in the blue leg alright let's insert a keyframe for that and then finally our airborne position where the where both legs off the ground right bring the green leg a little bit higher up and insert a keyframe alright one thing that can be very helpful to visualize the arcs that the legs and the arms move through is to come here to the armature settings and just enable ghosting somebody will go into the in range panel and enable ghosting from frame 1 to frame 6 so we can now see the positions of all of the bones across our animation it's a little bit overwhelming seeing all of them at once so I'm going to toggle selected only over here and let's just select the bones of the green leg so right away in my case at least we can see that in these first three frames the leg is moving in a very straight line and we'd rather it moved in an arc so in the second frame here I'm going to move it lower down so that should help that a bit this should be closer to the ground and this should be a little bit further back and also lower to the ground and right away that's looking a lot better I think all right let's see what the blue leg looks like so this looks mostly okay but the spacing is a little bit uneven here that's not quite on the ground just maybe move that a little bit further back so this can come back a little bit more and this would come slightly further back and in that way they eat the spacing between the positions is a little bit more even okay let's disable ghosting by just selling again frame back to frame 1 and let's have a look at this from front view the one thing that's a bit weird is how the foot is sort of sliding across the x-axis here so let's select the I cable and you can see that that has highlighted it in the dope sheet summary over here so we can press the drop down to see the keyframes for each of the individual axes we've got keyframes for X location Y location Z location as well as all of the rotation axes so we wanted to maintain its X location so I'm going to box select all of the keyframes except for the first one and delete those so now it keeps its initial X location here and at the end I'm just gonna press I to insert a keyframe there now we've changed the X location for this on the last frame so we're going to have to change it for the green leg as well on the first frame so let's just press control C here and then shift control V and that has updated it so we'll select the green legs I cable and just press I to insert a keyframe there and let's drop that down here as well so we can see its X location keyframes I'm going to delete all of these except for the first and the last one all right and then at the passing position is going to move it out a little bit and insert a keyframe so that it sort of swings around the blue leg and doesn't collide with it the other thing I noticed there was a little bit weird is the heads rotation so let me close these and let's select the head burn and I'm just going to delete all of its rotational keyframes so just delete those and it's going to frame one here and just not rotate it quite so much so press either and then can press control-c go to the end shift control V and insert the keyframe all right it's not swaying from side to side quite so much anymore can close that and we now want to mirror all of the keyframes the second step so let's select all the keyframes here with a and then select all of the bones in the scene view as well and then with the cursor over the dope sheet view and with our little scrubber on the last frame let's press ctrl C to copy the keyframes and then shift ctrl V to paste the mirrors of them all right and like I showed last episode you can also use the little buttons over here all right so we're ending on frame 13 which is the same as frame 1 so when we're playing this back we want to actually end on frame 12 before looping back to frame 1 so let's set our end keyframe to frame 12 and I'm just gonna hide the bones and press alt a to play okay so this is looking fairly decent I think so we're going to leave the run animation there I would quickly like to take a minute to create a very simple idle animation just so that we're ready to import this into unity in the next episode so you need to press alt H to unhide the bones and I'm going to close this run animation here create a new animation called idle just press the F key to save that and going to frame 1 let's press alt Arnold G to clear this and let's just set up a very neutral pose I rotate that a bit bring this down maybe the legs can be a little bit further apart I'll just move those out on the x-axis rotate the feet slightly and let's copy this over onto the other side do something like that for our first frame and then go to zoom out shift D with this R to say frame 100 or something and then at frame 50 and just move down a little bit as if he's sort of breathing slightly so set the end frame to frame 99 and we can preview left with alt a so nothing terribly exciting of course but it's just something to work with once we import this into unity in the next episode the other thing I'd like to do is to create one more action called simply tipos which has just got one keyframe of our character in his default tipos position and as always just press the F key to save that alright so we've now got four actions and idle run T pose and a walk and we are ready to import this character into the Unity game engine in the next episode so until then Cheers
