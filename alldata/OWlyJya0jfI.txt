so ladies and gentlemen today I'm going to be telling you in detail what it is that I actually do as a professional software engineer working for a big company I will tell you the Good the Bad and the Ugly I'll tell you what I've learned on the job what has surprised me why I've liked what I've disliked about it and most importantly what I actually do on a day-to-day basis in as much detail as possible the video that took this channel off is this one where I describe my journey of learning code at the time I was convinced that this was finally my dream career after trying like four different jobs before and if you watch till the end I might indeed have some thoughts about that purpose of this channel is to spread to the world my passion for coding because ladies and gentlemen in this day and age coding is one of the most valuable and monetizable skills that you can learn but if you choose to monetize your coding skills by working for a large company there are certain things that you absolutely need to understand before you go down this path so if you are considering becoming a professional software engineer you may want to listen this video very very carefully by the way if you haven't already seen it I already made another day in the life as a software engineer video so I'll leave that video down below if we do watch next okay so let's talk about what I actually do as a software engineer so I currently work for a consulting company as a junior developer this is slightly different to what you might think from companies like Google or Facebook that are product companies where essentially the product they're working on is their own product like Google search or YouTube on the Facebook platform whereas what we do at our company is essentially build software for clients the project I'm currently based on is a Java based Suite of micro Services okay so what does this actually mean in terms of my day-to-day then well my days as a software engineer look broadly like this I will wake up around six or seven a.m or whenever I want to wake up for the first hours of my morning I like to focus on my other stuff so for example this YouTube video I'll be planning videos and around 9 15 a.m is when my work day actually starts and that's when we have what we call a stand-up meeting the purpose of this meeting is essentially our entire team will gather where each of us update the team on what we are currently working on if there are any blockers how much I actually do during the day depends on how busy the project is at the moment we work in these Sprints where every day I'm essentially I'm picking up one ticket from the ticket backlog so like one toss and I will work on it until it's finished and then I will send it to my pH to be reviewed and if they approve it it gets merged into our main code base and at this point I've already picked up another ticket that I am now working on and essentially that is how my days look like so that is what I do now what do I actually think about it and the way I will approach my thoughts with this job is in terms of this perfect career framework that I sort of came up for myself number one we have money number two we have freedom number three Challenge and number four stability so now I want to go over all four of these in detail and tell you whether this actually ended up meeting my expectations so certainly software engineering and more broadly any it slash Tech related career is one of the best career choices that you can make if you're maximizing for money and the fundamental reason for this is that if you want to make money in this world you need to be offering the value of the world and how do you offer value of the world is by having high value skills in this technology driven world and despite what everyone's saying about uh recession coding is one of the if not the most high value skills in the world because everything runs on technology most things that you use on a daily basis is software based in some way and that's why the people who actually know how to build these things are extremely well compensated whether it means building software for bigger companies like Googles or Facebooks or building your own which obviously the even better way to make money I have more thoughts coming up on that when I go into my conclusion next is freedom and what do I mean about Freedom specifically I mean location freedom in the sense that you can work from wherever you want like you don't have to be sitting in an office number two is time Freedom so you can essentially choose whatever you want so the ideal career the ideal job for me where I can work from anywhere in the world at any time that I want as long as the job gets done and in terms of working at software engineering job out of any job in the world this is probably the job that gives you the most freedom and the most flexibility I have the freedom to work from home any day that I want and I have the freedom to do my work at almost any hour that I want as long as the work done obviously that depends on the specific company that you work for my company is really great in the sense that they do give you that freedom but what I cannot do is go work from I don't know Malaysia or Switzerland or some other country are still required to be in the UK which is the country where my company is and I don't have total time freedom because we do have the daily Standard meetings and all that but the real way to achieve true freedom is to work for yourself and you have your own business maybe your freelancing so if you want to achieve total freedom you may want to think about in the long term maybe freelancing or billionaires of their company which obviously is very very difficult and again more thoughts coming on that in a moment so third is challenge the reason why I really got into coding well one of the reasons is that out of anything I've done coding is very like intellectually stimulating and I can just get lost in building something but I didn't quite mean my expectations in the sense that when you're working for a big company and when you're a junior the type of work you're doing is not necessarily very challenging it's like a very small things because obviously when you're at the bottom you get given all the things that no one else wants to do right yeah so basically Okay so basically I'm just changing like one line how many of these repos are there again there's let's see what so you're doing like very menial things like changing configuration files so actually for me still building my own projects and doing my own things with coding is way more exciting than actually doing it working for a company that is something that you should absolutely consider and the system is that you should absolutely realize when you get into this job the excitement that you might have had for coding probably isn't going to be as high when you are doing it through this large organization so very small part of this some very big thing that you're building and I'm not saying that it should be any other way but that's just something that you should absolutely be aware of so then in terms of stability and if we get back to the fact that coding in this DNA is probably the most in-demand skill that that is once you have a couple of years of experience and you can demonstrate that you know what you're doing when it comes to programming and software engineering you are in very very high demand now maybe at this very current moment it's like slightly smaller than it would have been in the past but in general the stability that you can have is incredible like and this is the only part where working at job as a software engineer actually beats being an entrepreneur and like maybe working for yourself as a programmer because obviously working for yourself trying to build a company is extremely difficult you're probably gonna fail for a very long time when you're working for a job you can just get your foot in the door if you can just get your first job which I know is the most difficult part and that is why on this channel I try to help you do that in as many ways as I possibly can so the most critical part is getting your food indoor if you can do that if you can do that if you can stay in a job for a couple of years have some experience you're gonna have incredible stability unless your company happens to be bought by Elon Musk so with that we are almost ready to move into my conclusions and why despite all of these very positive features of this job my long-term plans for my coding career are a bit different than you might think before I explain that in more detail if you are watching this and you are someone who would like to become a software engineer to learn the code and build a career in this amazing field I do want to give you some tips on how to do that first if you succeed in this field you need to be the type of person who enjoys learning no matter which kind of programming career you pursue be freelancing working for a company or entrepreneurship you need to be relentlessly willing to upskill yourself if you want to get to the top and after you upskill yourself it is absolutely critical that you manage to find a way to Showcase your skills as a programmer to companies potential clients Etc but today there is a website called showcase which combines all the different aspects of showcasing your skills as a developer into one platform they are the sponsor of this video but I generally believe that the platform that they've built can be the future of how we as developers can put our skills and our ability out there to be noticed what you can do in showcase is simply fill out your profile which is essentially a combination of like LinkedIn GitHub medium Twitter and much more in one place then showcase will give you a custom domain that will build you your own showcase page that you can then link when applying for jobs and on top of that by clicking on generate resume on your profile you can also Auto generate a CV for yourself that's automatically optimized in its layout to pass the auto screening software that companies use to Auto reject candidates on showcase you can also do much more like actually apply for jobs directly by the website build connections with people that you worked in the past and showcase your knowledge as well by joining and contributing to various programming communities there's no point in being a great coder if no one who would be willing to pay you for those skills even knows about it I'll leave a link to Showcase down below for you to check out now let's talk about what I actually think about my job and what my plans are for my future coding career going forward I fully believe that as far as Jobs go this is the best job in the world because this job is the best combination of Freedom money challenge and stability compared to almost every other career out there as far as I'm aware and the fundamental reason for this is again that coding is simply an extremely high value skill but despite this if you think even bigger the ultimate way to monetize coding is obviously through entrepreneurship by building your own tech company which is extremely extremely difficult and definitely not for most people but because I see myself as being like very entrepreneurially minded I know that eventually this is something like this is the path that I will eventually want to go down so then why have I decided to work as a software engineer anyway if I know that eventually I will end up moving all the way amount of things but it's because in the beginning of your career the thing that you should be optimizing for is learning as much as possible as quick as possible and once you get past the basic stage or even the intermediate stage the best way and really the only way to keep progressing and to keep learning more is to actually do the job with other people and to work professionally so that is why for as long as I am still learning skills every day I will keep working as a software engineer so I can build the skills to then apply them to hopefully build something of my own by the way we're not talking about like building the next Facebook or anything like that there's this whole community of like Indie hackers literally you can go to the website I'll put it down below because people who build these like smaller software as a service products where they sort of like simple software maybe for like people who are building Shopify stores or something like that or some software that small companies can use as long as it solves a business problem that is actually useful for some businesses they are probably willing to pay for it and because all you need to do is build it once and then just maintain it the margins again can be extremely extremely high and there's people making like a hundred thousand dollars a month just from these projects that they build but again doing something like this successfully is like ridiculously hard so probably as soon as possible I'm just gonna start trying like all sorts of different things and if I try for like five years surely one of them is eventually gonna succeed right but even if this is your goal then I would say that getting a job as a software engineer first at least for some time is extremely extremely useful because it allows you to actually build an understanding of not only how coding applies to like small personal projects but actually how it is used in very large applications how to work with a team how agile working works the most exciting thing is that whether I end up failing with my lofty goals or becoming the next tech entrepreneur or not I will keep documenting my entire Journey with code on this channel like I have been doing so far I was pretty much ever since I started learning and ladies and gentlemen the only way for you to find out where this all ends up is by subscribing to the channel thanks for watching if you are still in the beginning of the journey and you want to learn to code I actually made the perfect thing for you I made this free skillshare class which I'm gonna link Down Below in the description which literally has step by step in way more detail than I can ever go to in these YouTube videos exact steps that I would take to go from completely zero to learning code I include a section firstly about the mindset of the learning principles that you need to be applying throughout your learning to go Journey then we go into what kinds of projects to be build what language you should learn and then how to pass interviews and how to do a job essentially a full step-by-step plan from the beginning and even if you already started especially the first section where I talk about how to learn that's something that most people don't even consider at all I think it's going to be highly valuable to you as well but I'll leave it down below in the description you can watch it for completely free by getting a free trial of skillshare which you can do by just going to the link Down Below in the description if you instead like to see a full day in my life as a software engineer in London I recommend you watch this video right now with that I will see you in the next video
