hello everyone and welcome in this video we're going to be trying to figure out why the konig segregate doesn't have a transmission and in order to do this we're going to try and figure out you know what speed can this thing still spin the tires and so you know to to spin the tires first of all we need to know the weight distribution of the vehicle and basically to find the maximum force that the vehicle can apply without those tires spinning use that simple equation f equals mu coefficient of friction times the normal force and so we're going to use a conservative estimate of a weight distribution of 40 60 split it's probably a little bit closer to 50 50 i would imagine uh the aguero r is 4456 but they don't release this number so we're just going to guess 60 of the weight is sitting on the back and to calculate our force at the tires for the rear tires 1.1 times 0.6 60 times the weight of the car 3589 pounds or 1628 kilograms so this gives us a force to spin the tires of 2368.7 pounds or 10.536 kilonewtons now the next thing we want to do we're just going to choose an arbitrary number 160 miles per hour and see if it can spin the tires at this speed using just this single gear this is equivalent to 260 kilometers per hour so we're going to calculate the force of air resistance and we're going to calculate the force of rolling resistance here's the equation for force of air resistance that comes out to be 2434.8 newtons we're going to be using a coefficient drag coefficient of 0.37 the koenigsegg ccx is actually 0.32 this is from the aguero r they don't release the regera numbers but so conservative 0.37 and for the frontal area we're going to be doing width times height minus ground clearance and so that's also going to be a conservative estimate 2.1 meters squared the ccx has a frontal area of 1.87 i would imagine the regera is actually a bit less than 2.1 it's not just a block driving down you know it has a shape to it so conservative 2.1 meter squared that gives us this force of 2400 newtons we want to add to that the force of rolling resistance so these are things pushing the vehicle back uh while it's driving at 160 miles an hour the rolling resistance comes out to be a coefficient of rolling resistance times the normal force i used 0.015 this is a conservative high number assuming sticky tires that gives us 239.56 newtons so really the two important things we've learned so far we need this much of a force in order to break the tires free and here's how much resistance we have at 160 miles per hour just from arrow and rolling resistance 2674.3 newtons or 600 pounds so in order to spin the tires at 160 miles per hour in other words do a burnout at 160 miles an hour we add these two numbers together 10 000 536 newtons plus 2 674 newtons and that gives us 13 thousand uh 210 newtons or 2970 pounds of force needed in order to break those tires free okay so does the engine have that much power as the next question so we're going to look at wheel torque at 160 miles per hour now koenigsegg does reveal that at 8 250 rpm you will be at 249 miles per hour so 160 miles per hour you can just do a simple ratio 160 times 8 250 divided by 249 so 160 miles per hour you're spinning at 5 300 rpm so how much torque are we making at 5 300 rpm well they do provide a torque curve and so you can see that's about 12 000 or 1250 newton meters okay great so we take that 1250 newton meters that's from the engine that's going to be multiplied by the final drive ratio before getting to the wheels final drive ratio is 2.73 there have been other statements with koenigsegg of it being 2.85 but the latest on their website says 2.73 so that's what we're going with 1250 times 2.73 3412.5 newton meters and in order to find the force at the tire we take the torque at the axle that 3412 newton meters and divide it by the radius of the tire 0.357 meters this gives us 9545.32 newtons or 2145 pounds now you can see that that number is less than this in fact it's about 72 percent of this number so with the engine alone you will not be able to spin the tires up however the engine provides 1250 newton meters the electric motors which there are three of on this vehicle provide an additional newton meters of torque so if you look at the combined torque curve it's going to look something like this where you have significantly more wheel torque than just what the engine is provided obviously because you've got those electric motors adding in that additional 900 newton meters so if the engine is only providing 58 of the torque but able to provide 72 percent of the torque needed to spin the tires at 160 miles an hour what did we learn well with that additional electric torque you could indeed spin the tires at 160 miles per hour now this is also taking into consideration using a conservative weight distribution a conservative drag coefficient a conservative frontal area and a conservative rolling resistant coefficient so it's probably actually a bit easier to spin the tires than i predicted here mathematically uh and so what's really cool about this if this vehicle has enough torque in a single gear to spin the tires up to 160 miles per hour that means if you were to use a more aggressive gear below that say first gear and then shift into this gear there's no point because below 160 miles per hour you're still able to spin the tires you're able to apply the maximum force to the ground so gearing gives you no advantage and this allows you to go all the way up to 250 miles per hour which is the vehicle's top speed it may be able to get slightly higher with a different gear ratio maybe not point is there's no need for additional gears because it can spin the tires up until such an enormously high speed so you don't need those additional gears very cool and there's actually a statement of christian von koenigsegg saying this vehicle can spin the tires up to 160 170 miles per hour and that's why it doesn't need gears i just wanted to mathematically prove it this wasn't indeed a arbitrary number i did choose that because he said it and i wanted to see if the math checked out so thank you guys for watching and if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below you shouldn't doubt uh mr koenigsegg i wasn't doubting him it's just kind of cool to see the math behind it i was sure he was accurate in his statement he's a pretty smart dude
