ladies and gentlemen in this video I am super excited to share with you a rising Prodigy and a potential future superstar in the world of Chess this person has made International headlines over the last couple of weeks here in late 2023 with Incredible results breaking records left and right and in this video I'm going to tell you about some of those recent tournaments and also look at a couple of games including a draw against a two-time national champion and a grand master of course if you don't know already I am speaking about 8-year-old Boron sandan from England she is 8 years old her International rating is over 2,000 roughly approximately her true strength is yet to be determined and she just completed an astounding accomplishment bod and I do apologize if I'm mispronouncing her name I saw it was pronounced bord uh sandan in a in a video uh I hope that is accurate uh bord recently played in a tournament called the European Blitz Chess Championship and I do apologize for this ridiculous website but this is chess results.com and this is this is what we have um this is a tournament of like hundreds of players and if you look at this list they are literally all Grand Masters there are obviously players in this event that are weaker than Grandmaster but you got to scroll all the way down you still find Grand Masters in 140th Place here uh at the bottom well after 13 Rounds bord at the age of eight scored 8 and a half points she's right here and she was she's under my name she's right here and she was the highest ranked woman at the end of the tournament with eight and a half points out of 13 if you look at her results they are astounding she defeated a 1500 then she beat a 1700 a 21 50 a 2180 lost to a grand master beat a 2180 2240 then she beat a 2200 and 2300 and at the end she drew a Grandmaster from Romania she defeated the women's coach of the international team the international women's chest team coach I believe that's what I saw in an article I saw that article and she is making headlines the BBC is covering her CNN is covering her the te the independent the telegraph they're all covering her absolutely incredible result and that was not her only incredible result in recent months several months ago she played the world Cadet Championship the the International Championship of kids who are under eight under 10 Under 12 and she literally won every game she went 11 out of 11 the craziest thing about her is that at some point she played 32 games in international competition and she went 32 and 0 32 games games 32 wins this is crazy International Master Lawrence Trent from England he's uh he's obviously a very strong player he's a commentator as well he's commentated in our world chess championships he participated in chess boxing so you know he's definitely Macho and very brave uh Lawrence said that he's never seen anything like it Lawrence himself put out a tweet that said she really might be the best player that England will ever see we will see we will see when we get there and if you didn't know she is also featured in this video which was on chess.com YouTube channel and various socials where she played against the 79-year-old British chess champion Peter Lee this was an incredible video it was just beautiful to see how 70 years can separate chess prowess and the two of them had conversation it was it was awesome I'm not going to watch the whole video and react to it uh cuz that's not really what I do on this channel but I I highly recommend you watch it after this video though uh and for now let me show you some of her games because she is 8 years old and she plays chess like she has been playing for decades at the age of seven seven not eight seven she played simos bordo would play simos she would play like seven games at the same time against adults who have lived like 30 years it's unbelievable stuff I want to show you a couple of games uh from the uh Cadet that she went 11-0 against some of the uh other best talented uh girls in the world and then that game against The Grandmaster um which uh which uh which she played in the last round of the European Blitz Championship so Bor starts with E4 she's an E4 player and also with black she plays the Caro Khan so like I mean yeah please become a Grandmas so bana played E4 her opponent in this game was a uh was a young lady from from Mongolia uh we had a uh we had a Pi's defense Knight C3 and now white has many options here white can play Bishop E3 Queen D2 and long castle that's generally called the 150 attack uh it's called the 150 attack actually because of uh English chess uh 150 is an ELO it's like a rating that you can have in the English Chess Federation and um basically they say that anybody with that 150 can you know can can can play this but bord in this game actually shows up and plays really really aggressively she doesn't play Queen D2 she doesn't prepare anything she immediately attacks her opponent with E5 clearly some sort of preparation right trying to catch her opponent off guard keep in mind these are literally seven-year-old children like eight seven and eight-year-old kids they travel to the opposite side of the planet and they participate in a world championship for kids it's unbelievable stuff I might I got to turn my heat off it's already it's already hot enough I just ate some uh some some lunch here Pawn takes E5 Pawn takes E5 and you can see that normally white would be losing the right to Castle but actually in this case that trade is bad for black because white would get a very powerful Rook it was actually better here for black to play Knight D7 which is a very difficult move to play there's also lines where white can play H4 and H5 and just try to get as aggressive as possible but um her opponent clearly thrown off guard a little bit tries to simplify us some pieces and plays Knight G4 and this is all borda needed because um this very very slight inaccuracy from the opening just giving you know seemingly just swarming a pawn here is already basically busted for black so Bona shows up attacks her opponent and here comes Knight D5 and she's crashing through now Knight D5 is actually really interesting because Bishop can take the pawn but the pawn is protected so I don't what exactly are we trying to do here well Bishop takes E5 by black black spent seven minutes on that move because alternatively you play Knight to A6 but then I just take the Knight and then I play Knight C7 and it it's actually a lot worse than you losing The Rook you you actually just get mated so if you are going to play a Kings Indian defense you do know you you do have to know how to deal with that Central Pawn strike and if you don't know how to deal with that Central Pawn strike it's going to get really bad Bor strikes this is a very instructive move you want to remove the defender of that pawn you actually don't want to move the pawn you don't want to move the pawn it is is better for you to get a full piece a full capable piece into the game to try to take and then take very very bad position for black for example black can play C6 but then I'm going to take the pawn so I'm still threatening to take the pawn I'm hitting the bishop I'm preventing you from castling I'm threatening your Bishop here that's probably still the best move to survive because in the game we get this and now Boda just Bishop takes E7 absolutely bulldozing her opponent you cannot take I mean you can in fact it's the top computer move and then you know black obviously didn't want to lose material and it looks like there's actually a way to trap the Knight there's no way to trap the Knight King G7 the Knight can just Gallop straight out of the position Bishop takes a E7 is a is a very very very tricky move Black Goes King D7 trying to defend herself bordon just just simple cool common collected trades off and now just has an advantage Bishop to B5 check white is not even up any material borda has just gotten out of the opening with an Advantage her Advantage is a better Pawn structure black has an isolated Pawn that's a Target also black has a king in the center preventing her own development so black is lacking in Pawn structure piece safety peace play bordon very quick development look at this developing all the pieces Black Blocks and now just H3 first we kick out the Knight or we can Castle Knight H6 and now White Castles beautiful play developed every single piece kicked the Knight back and now black has to make like perfect moves here to consolidate black probably has to go King d8 black wants to play A6 and disallow a fork so she goes Rook B8 B just activates the Rook so now both Rooks staring down the line you can't play Rook e eight here you'd love if you can get a rook trade like black wants trades look at how much Advantage goes away if white just trades some pieces but there's Knight F6 the problem is Knight F6 is devastating so borda is just relying on this positional pressure A6 Bishop back to A4 black kicks her out but still black has not really solved any problems it's really difficult for black to make a move black goes here now B jumps in with her Knight and now she applies more pressure with the bishop she's looking to potentially remove the bishop and get the Rook to E7 and The Rook can't go to E8 because of the Knight Black Goes Rook d8 borda plays Knight D4 now if you take on D4 which is what happens in the game the idea was not to take back we go zishan zuk in between move we removed the defender of the square we're going to get the bishop we're going to come back for the Knight Black's King is swarmed and it's real bad because in this position white just just unloads a beautiful merciless attack on the king beginning with B4 B4 is a very nice and simple move it deflects the king away from the Knight so white just ends up up a piece A3 would have led to force checkm in 10 moves now I don't exactly you know anticipate borda spotting this from a from from a far away distance but there is a way to swarm the king but she she does it with B4 she just plays the immediate B4 and uh goes up a piece Black's King walks in Bor picks up a couple of Pawns and then and here Rook D2 Knight E4 Bishop D1 boom traps the King on the outskirts of the board it's like Sudoku this covers everything this covers everything those are covered by the Knight and the bishop a true group effort completely freezing the king and a beautiful game starting with an attack from the opening fizzling out into a long-term positional advantage against the peace play of the opponent and just an excellent excellent game she also wins with black though in this game she played against uh ruu Yi YuYu from China actually YuYu got the silver medal so the tournament that I just told you about where Bor got a gold medal uh ruu Yi got a silver so she was she was the second best so let's see what happens when the second place uh second best plays the first best we have a semi slav we have Bishop G5 but on a rock solid Knight bd7 and uh clearly her openings are Cambridge Springs so this is the Cambridge Springs defense where you pin the Knight like this then you play Bishop B4 you rely on on various things coming to the E4 Square as well let's see how well prepared the players are white is well prepared Knight D2 is the top computer move undevelop the Knight blocking the pin defending here trying to play Knight B3 and attacking the queen so it's ridiculous that these seven and eight-year-old children have bulletproof openings like it's it's unbelievable there is a trap here as well uh let's just say something like this bishop D3 there is Pawn takes pawn and then you try to hit there of course if there then white will take but that is sort of the idea black plays Bishop B4 which is the recommendation White playing the top computer move just playing rock solidly with the queen it's just unbelievable like I'm I'm blown away at the level of preparation these kids have Knight C4 bordon drops back and then plays this move C5 so both both players still in prep I mean they've both played 11 moves of Cutting Edge Theory uh trying to attack the center white plays A3 after spending 8 minutes clearly no longer in her preparation gets a rock solid position and now both sides should Castle White plays Knight E5 which is fine Bor Castle she's a principal player White Castles as well and this is the position after 15 moves so the two best girls under eight on the entire planet have the following position how is Bor going to play this well I'm thinking the Rooks want to come here right because that's the way they can actually maximize their pressure when there's e and B pawns you kind of want to put the Rooks there we need to figure out if we need to deal with this Knight or if we don't we should probably play H6 so that it's no longer targeted or G6 so what are we going to do okay there's H6 right white plays A4 taking space potentially breaking apart our structure we go here Queen A2 and in this position the top engine move is to take this Pawn everything else is equal it's minus 27 because black can go here and white can't take with the c Pawn because then you actually sack your queen for two Rooks sometimes in chess you can sack a queen for two Rooks it's not always the best but when you can paralyze your opponent's pieces like this and even pick them up up it's going to be the best so in this position after Rook C8 let's say white had played like H3 CD4 doesn't actually do anything because you make a big trade and then it's just probably a draw but Bor strikes on D4 the second the opportunity presents itself because now she clarifies her opponent's structure she doesn't allow the position to get opened and these are called hanging pawns not hanging in the traditional sense where you could just take them in one move but when you have a queen Pawn structure of D and C that was awful D and C versus e and B that's called hanging Pawn structure and black tries to apply pressure and win them Knight D5 you can't go C4 because you soften that up and if you play C4 I'll Fork you I'll grab your bishop and then I'm going to smash at the center okay but that's actually I believe that's what happens C4 Knight B4 all right white making some positional mistakes Bona just immediately goes for the bishop brings the second Rook perfect play like sophistic she's seven or eight when she played this game the threat now is to take the Knight there is a pin white needs to spot that she plays Rook C3 now the only way black is going to make any progress is by removing the Knight it's very counterintuitive to move a pawn in front of your king like that okay some people even dare to say never play F6 that is accurate for the most part but you've got to play F six in this position look at this she applying pressure but there's no way to make progress in this position if you're going to dilly dally you have to play F6 and she does she convinces herself now is the right moment she's going to Target White's pawns white still thinks she's on the offensive the Knight goes there now H5 another very well timed and sophisticated Pawn push to force the Knight back to F2 and now she re re re uh organizes her pieces look at this and it actually turns out that white should have never been overextending in the first place because now all of these threats are on the board white goes Queen E2 back trying to create a little bit of counterplay NOW Boron just has to keep her nerves and which one does she go for she doesn't go for anything doesn't doesn't go for anything she threatens mate which is surprisingly difficult to stop white plays Rook G3 but now the H Pawn which was going to get captured a move Ago by the queen is utilized as an attacking mechanism The Rook will now be stuck on the outskirts of the board trying to win that pawn back and the second the second that The Rook went over here Bor realizes The Rook is going to waste time on the edge of the board which means I can go straight down the middle and The Rook actually can't take the pawn because that's M that's made on G2 a cra crazy game like a a very very very high class game Rook takes Rook takes you can't take my Pawn I'm going for this I'm going for this I'm going for something on the first rank as well H3 she goes for Oh What A Move what a move she could have went there and there but she sacrifices The Rook it's a sacrifice in quotes because Queen G2 is just she's two pawns up and now she just has to convert she picks up a third Pawn King F7 well-timed king move kicking out the Rook she trades and she takes the punch she takes the pawn because there's no way to get in against her king that's the most important thing here it's not about grabbing as many pawns as possible and running out of the casino I hope she's not in a casino because she's eight it's mostly about the fact that your king is safe and the queen and the Knight can't touch the king queen C6 threatens the queen trade threatens mate Queen D2 and she just plays A5 she has absolutely nothing to concern herself with A4 white is completely stuck Bishop takes G2 and her opponent resigns what a game if we ran that through a game review I I would dare to say she played at 99% she played basically a perfect classical chess game she played a great Cambridge Springs opening played all of the right ideas at the right moment and broke her opponent down maybe she'll get like 96% cuz you know she didn't play F6 fast enough and the computer's going to complain yeah she gets 94 one inaccuracy was just wasting a little time with the queen and what else why else is it 94.4 she made a Miss she had a Miss look the computer deducts 5.6 percentage points for not playing F6 that's it her only mistake in the game was not playing F6 fast enough that is nuts her estimated ELO this game was 2500 2,500 and if you think that's impressive remember she won every single game in the world Cadet she won every single game at the European youth Championship she's 32 and0 in international competition at that level but she just played this tournament the European Blitz championship and before I show you this game against Nichi I do just want to say um keep in mind what this tournament is this is a 13 round we're going to go back to that ugly screen this is a 13 round 3 minute 2 second bonus tournament look how many Grand Masters are playing it was won by David Navara Ivano Kadri SAR San marosan brro mov jooba look how many look how many Grand Masters played the damn event it is incredible if I scroll down to the last person on this list 150 it's Irina bumaga who's a who's an international master and a and a legend she's a beast look how many players there are it's it's insane 73rd Place is is unreal I will remind you all could be boy girl doesn't matter like for borda to get this spot is is if you look at the rankings there isn't a single another Junior player here we have Yi bushka right Under 12 he got eight points and and that's it I mean you go down this list there's not a single other Under 12 player there's under 14 very strong uh s uh this is a prodigy from Ukraine uh sov he's very strong but like this is a sensational result completely unheard of and she broke a record in this game she I think she she tied the record for youngest player to not lose to a grand master in a tournament game not lose I think she because she Drew right I think there's also you have to beat one now which is a separate record that she has chance to to to beat this is nuts I mean this is so here we go D4 D5 vladislav n is 50 years old two-time national champion of Romania Romania has great chess players E5 Bishop F5 and he plays H4 one of the most aggressive variations of the caroan where you try to go here and trap the bishop now you don't want to play E6 here with black you want to play H5 H6 or another sideline there's A6 and so on B plays the main line which is H4 H5 and now the main line is Bishop G5 or Bishop D3 nin plays C4 because again you're playing a kid when you're playing a kid you kind of want to take them out of their comfort zone she captures okay and then she plays E6 which is exactly what you're supposed to do and then black is going to try to occupy that square with pieces maybe put the bishop on B4 let's C Knight to E2 Knight to D7 normal stuff Knight C3 she goes Knight B6 so she's just going for that D5 Square he goes back to D3 and clearly from the opening despite her speed the computer is preferring white ever so slightly but the plan is still very easy for Black Knight H6 or Knight E7 put the Knight on F5 put something on D5 maybe break in the center Knight E7 Bishop G5 I love how quickly she plays she unpins herself she's ready to Castle queenside he goes long Castle she goes D5 I don't love that move I wish she would have put that Knight there and that Knight there but it doesn't matter she plays here and this is probably the best position that he could have hoped for from the opening because now black struggles to Castle right also black is constantly monitoring the dark squares and black and and white does it move away from being Rock Solid if Bishop to E7 you take and plop the knight in very unpleasant so what does she do now she goes for counterplay she spends 20 seconds her biggest think of the opening which means that she's clearly on uncomfortable here Queen to B3 loses all the advantage because of the well-timed queen to D5 apparently white should have went Queen B1 which is virtually unfindable the idea of Queen B1 is that Queen D5 obviously doesn't really attack much and I kick you out then I go here then you know or here and then it's bad but Queen B3 allows Queen D5 and now she just gets the Queens off and she puts the Knight right back on D5 and she says how are you going to beat me Mr Grandmaster how are you going to beat me with no queens how you going to beat me with no queens and four pawns that can't move forward Five Pawns that can't move forward dare I say six pawns so if white has no Pawn Mobility how is white going to win the game well he plays Rook age three now remember when you're playing a kid you still got to pretend that you're confident cuz they're a kid you never know they might get scared she takes with the King she loses the right to Castle The Rook goes to G3 she plays G6 she has no weaknesses you can argue this as a weakness but it's very easy to protect you can argue B7 is a weakness but you know we can argue Forever Knight D6 she defends herself and I got news for you she's going here she's going to trade the Knight and if she is successful in trading that Knight she going to trade that one too and then she's going to play Knight C7 Knight E8 or Knight B5 nad's got to do something now he plays Knight E4 it's a great position she plays Knight C8 patient she's not trying to attack she's not getting too low on the clock this is the biggest time deficit of the entire game Knight goes back to C4 he's trying to keep as many pieces on the board as possible Right the more pieces he keeps on she gets into time pressure she's going to lose be 5 now it's time for her to create counterplay but she is creating a weakness for herself how is B how is bodna going to deal with that Rook B6 she's got a minute left on the clock she's down 37 seconds this is the most unpleasant the position has been thus far Rook A6 trying to kick out the Knight but the Knight can now go to B7 and C5 or D6 and he does the experienc grandmas has tricked her with 40 second time Advantage very very bad situation he's going to get those dark squares very bad Rook B6 the Knight lands on C5 definitely not what the doctor ordered A5 now down to 40 seconds nearly a one minute time deficit but remember every time you make a move you gain two seconds on the clock he could go King C2 and maybe Rook A1 he could play Rook F3 he could try to build up with the pawns she still hasn't moved the whole Rook Rook F3 now she's forced to move the Rook now Rook G1 clearly he's looking for G4 maybe he should wait bodna plays A4 A4 now it's plus one and a half nearly two if white plays G4 if white plays G4 for now he's in good shape because this doesn't scare you what scares you is the arrival of The Rook that is how this position will crumple but A4 makes The Grandmaster think she's doing her best she plays A4 and had G4 happened she would have taken she would have kept the G file closed but the problem is H5 and Rook G7 is very powerful as an idea but he takes he took on A4 and he opened up the position but wait a minute she lost the pawn how did we miss that oh cuz she's four for King and now she's in she's in White's position and White's position is fully relying on that Central blockade white now doesn't have any time to play G4 because after take take black is going to get counterplay on the B file oh my goodness so Rook C1 Knight B6 Rook A3 Rook A8 she's down to 27 seconds on the clock but she is well timing her defense and now he trades that's a big sigh of relief because the Rooks were going to team up to terrorize the black position position F3 Knight C7 Knight B3 and one thing that really strong players frequently do is they over press when they think they have to win but right now that's not really a risk she's going to lose this Pawn though oh my goodness King D7 she's lost the pawn she's now down Five Pawns to four Rook B6 and she has 20 seconds on the clock 17 seconds on the clock she goes to an end game she tries to trade into a rook and night end game where she's just going to play against that pawn now traditional wisdom tells you it's an outside pass Pawn it's a Pawn on on the outskirts of the board and probably white should be able to coordinate and win King E7 oh this is very unpleasant this is very scary she has 11 seconds on the clock Knight to E3 Knight to F5 uhoh uhoh Knight E4 is is recommended here but he goes for it G4 she takes he takes she's creating counterplay oh my goodness he's sneaking a pawn yeah this is terrifying the pawns three squares away from queening She's creating counterplay though on this pawn and this Pawn he runs away Rook takes B2 What's Happening Here The Rook goes to H2 to patrol the pawn the pawn is one square away from queening and it's defended but she grabs the pawn just in time and now she's got checks she can come back and stop promotion white can't do anything Rook A8 to make a queen Knight G6 just in time just in time with 7 seconds on the clock and that is exactly what happens and in this position knight4 Knight G5 and they Shuffle and they repeat moves they make a draw by repetition because there's nothing else there is absolutely nothing else if let's say white tries to play on I don't even know how like if how does white play on White's going to lose the pawn there's nothing that can be done if anybody can play on here it's bord who can apparently walk to E5 and I don't know man I really feel like if she did that her opponent might have I mean he would have just went back to G5 but uh if for some reason he went this way two pawns up what a game what a game where she held her nerves she was just down a clean pawn and nearly 50 seconds in a Blitz game against the grandmas 50 years old he is 46 years older than her think about that number that's four and a half decades so much experience and with 20 seconds on the clock she held her nerves and she made a draw eight and a half out of 13 I don't know how many women participated in the European Blitz Championship but out of all of them she ranked first we saw bulaga there right we saw the uh uh Costa she's the uh National trainer of the women's team just unbelievable just what a performance and this is a player to watch this is a player to watch shout out to uh B and um I mean she's being covered by all of British media so we really might be we really might be looking at um who knows the next uh top five player in the world it's too early to tell and we don't want to put any pressure on kids shoulders but spectacular stuff very very exciting and um we're always on the hunt for the next Magnus Carlson or the next uded pgar so why not Bor I hope you all enjoyed the video 40% off holiday sale on courses ending at the end of the Year enjoy your Christmas enjoy your holidays uh get out of here
