we are going back to school and yes you heard that right when I say we I mean you and me I'm ready I'm ready we're going back to school backpack ready to go a few weeks ago I shared that I am going back to school for practical Hands-On Ai and machine learning now this is done through a school here in Toronto that I'm going to be going to or attending actually it's virtual oh it's remote we're we're doing this remote okay guess I'll just uh Park myself down but you get the point attending these classes this is a year-long program so I am committed this feels like a commitment I'm sharing this with you because throughout my journey uh learning about different areas around artificial intelligence machine learning having the exposure and experience from both the technical side of things but then also to the business side of things I want to share it with you I want you I mean this kind of sounds like a win-win you get to take this course essentially but for free I mean you're not taking this course but I'm going to be sharing with with you my learnings and my highs my lows along the way I'm sharing this with you or this recap with you because it got me thinking as I was starting to prepare for class which is coming up in 12 days which is Wild by the way I thought Jeff what is your plan what is your road map for learning AI are you just going to go in and wing it or what what's the plan other than of course having a proper syllabus that I'm going to follow and whatnot now I've been studying AI for I would say about the past year on my own I've been sharing a lot of my learnings with you so that's not going to change it's just in a more formal setting I I just felt like I wanted to take that next step I'm sharing all this because I want to share with you the road map that I came up with for how to learn AI in 2024 now this is a really it was really challenging for me to come up with this road map for a few reasons one because I felt like it really depends on what role or what area in AI you are interested in that will depict what you are learning about AI but I thought you know what's a good place to start let's start with the basics let's start with some key Concepts from there let's go more into some courses you can take some communities you can join and what next steps look like I think that sounds like a good plan what do you think school Tiff yeah that sounds good I guess I guess I going take my backpack off still all right she said so let's get into [Music] it so regardless of what path you are interested in when it comes to AI there's a few things that you should know or terms you should know no matter what let's break down the three kind of ways AI is really looked at at a very high level and I don't want to say three types of AI or anything like that because there's so many but let's focus on the main three one being artificial narrow intelligence Ori so this is essentially how we interact often with AI today so you can think of it as AI performs a single task so something like voice recognition or something like recommendations on streaming services this is using a an then we have AGI or or artificial general intelligence and this is something you've probably seen in the news a lot or this is one of the more common ones mainly because of speculations of what it could look like this is something we do not have today uh but what it essentially is is the ability for AI to understand learn adapt and Implement knowledge across a wide range of tasks at a human level so it can solve its own problems build out different solutions to things it doesn't necessarily need us to guide it as much then we have the third which is more kind of like from Back to the Future well I don't even think Back to the Future was this far in the future but that is a SI and that is artificial super intelligence which honestly is kind of what it sounds like it is well they call it the final level of AI I don't know but it refers to a futuristic scenario where AI surpasses human intelligence so it is taking one step further you could say as far as its ability to think on its own act on its own and really be able to do many if not yeah I would say many jobs that we do today now this is not a video to scare you about what the future of AI could look like but more so just to make you aware of the different types of AI or how it's kind of categorized and before we get to ASI super intelligence we are very far from that so let's just keep that in mind and I think as we always do as humans we figure it out as we go along and that's the beauty of it anyways let's keep on diving into it I also wanted to cover what is the difference between something like data science artificial intellig machine learning or deep learning I'll put up on screen here this graph or chart which I think does a good job of explaining it and I wanted to break down these topics for you because they're often used interchangeably or tied so close together which in some scenarios makes sense but in others we almost generalize these big topics just because they're buzzwords so as you can see from this diagram AI is programs with the ability to learn and reason like humans machine learning is the algorithms with the ability to learn without any explicitly programmed so they are learning from models and data and just really understanding as far as um they're they're based on algorith they are algorithms at the end of the day then we have deep learning which is essentially a subset of machine learning in which a artificial neural networks adapt and learn from larger databases so as you can see even with in AI there is so many layers to it and it can get intense pretty quickly I know what you're thinking well maybe you're not what you're thinking but I'll tell you what I was thinking when I was learning all this well if there is so much to AI what is the point of even learning it seems like every time I take a course or have a discussion about it I feel like I'm falling behind and I hear you on that I feel that way often times too one thing I've learned though throughout uh learning AI or any other technology is you just need to take it step by step the worst thing you can do is just not try to learn at all because of that feeling of H it's just moving too quickly for me it's okay you will feel caught up at some point it's just that initial learning curve that can feel a little bit overwhelming so I just wanted to say that as a side side note don't get too caught up on how vast the subject is especially which brings me to my next point is having an understanding of what area in AI you want to focus on let's use the example of say you are interested in ethics around Ai and regulations around that maybe you come from a law degree or a psychology background and you're really interested in that side especially around the regulations with AI now this is something where I wouldn't suggest okay you need to go start with python learning programming in order to become an expert in that area it's more so around the psychology of it the regulations the the law that's required with these regulations th those are areas you need to be an expert in now you do need to be extremely educated on artificial intelligence and its capabilities as well to make those decisions but you don't need to become a programmer and I really wanted to highlight that because before you even dive into your journey with AI take time to understand how you want to use this how you want to use this in your career how you want to grow with AI what what's the purpose of your learnings and even if it's just because you want to learn something interesting that will look different as well all right let's move on to some courses now these are courses that are both Technical and some are non-technical for the reason being I know we have an audience of both and I think even if you are a technical person maybe you don't want to dive into the technical side of AI and that's fine too I talk about these courses a lot the first ones I'm going to mention which is course Sarah courses mainly because they are taught by some of the world's best lead ERS when it comes to AI I mean deep learning specialization this is a course that covers deep learning structured machine learning projects and neural networks and this of course is by one of cor s's co-founders Andrew so it's a really great course now I haven't taken this course specifically but I've taken a ton of other courses by him around Ai and they are so brilliant the way he can break down topics and such a simplistic form is really incredible the other one I want to share with is Udacity so if you are interested in really garnering or gaining that degree or certification Udacity is definitely a place to check out one that stands out to me is the machine learning engineer Nano degree so this is a program that focuses on Advanced machine learning techniques and algorithms so if you are more on the technical side I would definitely recommend checking this out I mean it always is good too to get that certification or in this case a nano degree that you can put on your LinkedIn I don't know I need sound effect can you tell it's been end of day I've had too much coffee it's it's I'm in Canada it's get it's dark at like 5: now it's it's happening all right let's keep on moving one more I want to share with you is about MIT open courseware I love MIT I love their newsletter I love every they're just so Innovative I think they're great one course though that they offer is called introduction to deep learning so this is a course that really starts from the foundations working the way up into deep learning methods and application so this is more so kind of a mix of Technical and non-technical but i' recommend it to both um individuals all right let's talk a little bit about community and I think this is funny because I don't hear when I read online you know when I research for these videos I read online what other people are saying and other guides around the road map for 2024 Ai and sometimes they can be so specific that I think who is this for because it sounds like you're making it seem like the only people that can get into learning about AI or these super hackers or the other side is it's very non-technical it feels like well what like who is your audience and that's why for this video I wanted to keep it very realistic as though that everyone every single person watching this video has their own Journey no one's alike and your goals with your learnings are all unique as well and that's really important to keep in mind because there's no prescription overall that I can be like next you need to Learn Python next you need to learn that because that's not accurate it really depends on what you want to do the purpose of this video is more so for you to uncover that take away what some of the key topics are and that's that's why I really wanted to bring up Community because Community is one of those things that if you don't have it you're going to struggle often times we will struggle I'll speak for myself often times I will struggle with learning something new I need that sense of community to bring me up support me I'll share right on screen here some of my favorite communities uh especially in the artificial intelligence World also okay this is a really cool thing that I do see look at this is this like what was that movie the um Godfather or I don't know what's old movie they're like welcome sorry I'm going on tangent now one thing I do though often times is on LinkedIn just as a little tip I will follow different thought leaders in Technologies I'm interested in so in artificial intelligence in future Tech that's a really great way to stay up to date easily on different topics that they are sharing about I mean I try and be one of those individuals too um I I love using LinkedIn for that as well so just following people there that really bring education and insight into your dayto day I don't know why I've kind of gravitated towards LinkedIn lately for that all right I hope you found this video helpful between sharing some courses giving you some communities to join some different tips as well as kind of giving starting the video off with covering some really big topics that are often spoken about almost too casually when it comes to Tech where people don't really have the context or understanding what these topics are about with machine learning or deep learning so I really want to cover those as well I hope you found this video helpful and valuable leave in the comments you know I got to say this leave in the comments any other videos you want me to make and I will see you all soon it's time for dinner and no more coffee for [Music] me
