keep calm and just say no the follow-up that's right the follow-up I have been grilled by the primogen the name is the primagen on YouTube look at that it's even a follow-up it's a follow-up to hiring is broken and look at this that's me look at that that's me I made that I made that box art I've received way lots of cool feedback for my article keep calm and just say no to coding challenges but none was as fun as being live grilled by the prime engine on his YouTube channel yeah hey subscribe baby let's keep on going uh I was alerted about this video by three different friends one presenting me the primage in this way primogen is an engineer doing impressive stuff at Netflix he is very active in the rust Community which jokes on them uh as you see in this video he has a style that some peeps love and some people hate primagen grills better than Bear Grylls absolutely absolutely yeah I I would say that this is probably true I do get I do get the hate messages not none worst of all the hate messages than when uh the rust core Community calls you a racist that was the worst one but then after that it's less bad you know what I mean it's just the rust core people uh those are the ones that really I feel like are not very nice uh but they don't like me but the rest seem to be very delightful so fair enough but for my part I found this video absolutely delightful interesting okay some people told me uh to try to let's see okay hold on some people told me to try out making videos but I declined I think it'd be pretty lame YouTuber I'm just a dude who writes words about stuff I'm pretty much the same guy I just say words about stuff um all right so let's see what what's gonna go on here so this is the part where I think he's gonna try to correct the record and try to tell me this is where you goofed up okay this is where you goofed up and I do think this I do think this is important okay after such an uh Artful build up I was hoping he would just not only agree with me and indeed all right so this looks like Okay so this looks like a quote generated by the subtitle so this might be a little bit goofy okay just so you know hey guess what everybody this person just gave you the best way to get rejected from many job interviews this is true you will get rejected from many job interviews and I believe he agreed with that in previous if you just say no to an interviewing process it's extremely hard you know what I mean it's just extremely hard you can't just undo you can't just say hey no coding interview and then boom it just works out you know what I mean uh perhaps this person doesn't need a job that much true uh and therefore can go like this what do you do oh you're like 93 of tech companies and you have a coding challenges LOL sorry uh I don't accept them it leaves uh it leaves a hash tray in my mind I wonder what I said there it leaves a hash tray in my mind I don't even know what that means so no thank you uh both to your job and your interview process yeah I mean when you say no to part of someone's interview process you are saying that uh that started well uh alas that's mostly a misunderstanding okay good here we go we're getting into the disagreement let's go let's go all right so it looks like he's gonna do uh looks like he's going to do another quote from me from YouTube so maybe a bit broken English here so far without reading anything else my current take is that it's some kind of let's see this is some kind of worse advice I've ever heard real talk you literally have been told by companies that there's a secret handshake it involves knowing basic data structures how to apply them so you can go and study for eight hours uh get good at that walk in do the secret handshake and go right inside the door yeah I still agree with that literally the company companies are telling you right now exactly what their secret handshake is know your data structures know how to use them tell me the running time understand how for loops work boom right it's like that simple you know those things you can get into the door of most companies just facts so I must have I must have been wrong here I must have misinterpreted his stuff my answer will be boring I agree with all that we have a basic misunderstanding of what a coding challenge is meant uh in the context of my article I didn't mean an algorithmic interview and the confusion is my fault I assumed that it was obvious when I meant coding challenge yeah see when I hear coding challenge I think algorithmic interview type one in the chat if you think algorithmic interview when you hear the term coding challenge hello ping you are the Pink Guy pink pink Okay so all right press 69 in the chat when you hear coding challenge you don't think algorithmic interview 69 in the chat interesting what do you think can someone just type what you think when you hear the term coding challenge what do you think I'm super curious foreign it's about a two-thirds one-third okay 60 uh take home take home people think take home really Capture the Flag okay that seems fun to take home four to eight hours Lee code well lead code would be coding challenge people are voting for both uh yeah I know people always vote algorithms take home okay so a lot of people think uh take home pack the Mainframe classic overdose okay that seems a little strange but clearly uh it happened let's see it often happens what was obvious to the writer is not in fact obvious to the readers this is like the greatest piece of advice I've ever heard in my lifetime if there's anything we can take from any of these articles This truly is the best thing you can take if you can Master this one skill you're going to just go farther so much further if you can figure out how to deliver the minimal amount of context to get the most people on the same track it is this like it's a magic skill in which I have no idea how it works uh what happened uh is that I wrote the article after seeing a friend waste uh way too many times and uh and morale with a coding challenge that sort of let's see that's sort of that sort okay we are a music player app company so we challenge you to do a simplified music app player uh with a lying time estimate of four hours and then we'll evaluate evaluate the code quality according to unknown criteria hmm interesting I think they put in I think he I think he embellished this part a lying time estimate okay this is this is interesting so so what he's talking about is actually these large take-homes let me think about this so I have done two take-homes in my life one I was rejected for the other one I got the job the other one I got the job for of course was Netflix right the one I didn't get the job for was coinbase I didn't pass the coding interview I did you know they gave me a really nebulous requirement so I just kind of made up stuff and uh apparently they judge you on how well you can suss out people's imaginations you know what I mean I I always hate that this obviously is really this is a lot this is a lot of work maybe if you do it on the web I don't know how long it would take but I mean there's pretty simplified controls on the web do you know what I mean like there's only a few things you have to know how to do the hard part is what I don't know is if it does the audio class give you time estimates so the hardest part would be like the slider you know what I mean slider would probably be very hard hey fellow technologists well hey uh besides for that I think everything else would be pretty straightforward you know what I mean time to present yeah I mean well there's that you know you gotta make sure you jump I'm not sure what controls are but I mean if you can do that I mean I don't think this is a terribly hard problem I think I could whip out a pretty basic one in four hours maybe even sooner maybe two hours I'd probably spend an hour and a half trying to get typescript to work properly and then after getting typescript to work properly uh with a nice build system and everything I would then probably have to code that up in probably like 20 minutes with Tailwind you know I mean that would take about 20 minutes and then I'd go and deployed on something wild like Google app engine just to like throw it somewhere weird you know what I mean and then they'll be like what and then I'll be like yeah Google app engine baby and I'll toss them a wink you know super strange uh how about the trying feasibility I don't know anyways let's keep on going so what's good hiring criteria in the comments of the previous article I have lazily described all kinds of challenges as good and bad wait uh what does that mean there is actually a real definition of good hiring criteria in the literature which I would assume uh summarize this way a good hiring criteria must be relevant stable and realistic and okay there's there's missing comma somewhere in here a good hiring criteria must be relevant stable realistic and very clear okay I do like that I do like reproducible hiring I think that that's really good for example algebraic challenge at Netflix is relevant because Netflix does a lot of coding stuff so we do very little of it uh stable because if you ask different people whether a candidate succeeded at an algorithm challenge they uh they would mostly agree yeah that's fine uh realistic because it takes time let's see it takes a limited amount of time and the same for the company and the candidate learning a data structured algorithms is a doable task okay I agree with all these ones very clear yeah because it's almost like a math problem uh sort of but yeah I see what you're saying a simple whiteboard encoding challenge that is not dependent on some really stupid algorithm that a PhD person got that you're expected to know in an instance right like I I always hate those kind of coding challenges right the ones that are you know find a cycle in a singly linked list if you've never done that and they just want you to discover that for the first time and you've never read that it's like it there is definitely like there's definitely an aha moment that has to happen in your life that's really hard do you know what I mean like it is most certainly not a very emotionally easy first time going over that problem I hate those kind of things I think those ones are such boring take-homes well or not take homes but coding challenges whiteboarding challenges let's see why a coding challenge is the ones I had in mind coding challenges are relevant in the sense that they uh that the simplified music app has clear link to a real music yeah okay coding challenges are not stable meaning that if you present the same coding challenge to different companies or even different people inside the companies you'll get a looks good to me not our level of quality trademark and okay so that's actually a reasonable takeaway which is when someone reviews code versus you review pseudocode in a whiteboarding idea these are very different do you know what I mean I can buy this this makes a lot of sense to me at least is that you can't perfectly gauge it right because everyone has a different feel some people knit hard like code reviews you get the right person on and it's just knit after knit and they're so annoying and then if you go the inverse hey lithium you go in the inverse some people just don't care and so it's totally like a you know uh coding challenges are not realistic for someone outside the team uh that's uh what the term means people inside the team who know everything about building a music player who designed the challenge can create uh can criticize your work in 42 different ways now see I see I don't I don't agree with this I don't agree with this at all like if you're just doing a web music player and you use the audio interface and you put up a couple things pause right you have a very simplified acceptance criteria you know pause and play and make a video thing and then how would you extend this like keep in mind how to extend this to other controls I think that that's actually a pretty reasonable coding Challenge and that even if you don't like their coding style as long as you have good interviewers you will go okay this is good this is bad this is why it's good this is why it's bad I don't know I kind of just disagree with this in general uh coding challenges are not very clear now that on the other hand that's just like a pure mistake some coding challenges on whiteboards aren't very clear had coding challenges where they they expect you to suss out what you're supposed to do anyone's ever had one of those those are the worst do you know what I mean those are just the worst coding challenges I've never done a tech interview oh really okay I I hate those things I like clear concise ideas in in an interview but you got the best candidate you don't have the best candidate you truly don't have the best candidate a best candidate is not chosen by how well they can take your really shitty instructions and make them clear if that's how your job Works you're working with horrible people okay I like I get that when you're working in a group the goal is to get what is inside your head out there so everyone can try to build the same you know stuff but if you have a designer that's like yeah I need some boxes and then you're like okay well what's the boxes why don't you ask some questions to let me to to get me to tell you you're like dude [ __ ] you go just give me a design stop this this is stupid don't do no don't do that that's the worst form of communication I'm not gonna ask you to get it out of me show me okay that's your job my job is to build what you think is best and then we can have dialogue okay there's always ambiguity but you work that out there's not planned ambiguity ask zoltar like right a real talk that's I hate those interviews those are just the worst uh so this I feel like is just BS this is a BS thing because this is not a problem of coding challenges this is a problem of any kind of engineering uh people that intentionally make things vague I don't like I think that if you're gauging someone on being able to solve a problem you need to give them the most precise definition of said problem uh in my humble opinion is it humble or is it horny I don't know what the H stands for uh companies can do better than cargo called someone else's bad idea wasting your uh wasting both your time and Company's time uh when you say no to something important uh to you always say yes to something else you protect your time you protect your morale you protect your self-respect one thing I didn't mention because I was writing from a candidate point of view is that they also waste the time of the company that's true uh that's here not relevant for Netflix because I guess that's shitloads of talent candidates apply there so this is not true I do think that again I think me and this guy have like a fundamental impasse on what we both think uh I think coding Channel Good take homes are great good take homes give a chance for a candidate to show a different side of them that's not present in a uh present in a 50-minute interview right because some people they really shine when they're under pressure so that's just how some people are I'm I'm I definitely feel like I shine under pressure when someone says hey go make this right now I feel like I can do that really well but when someone says hey go make this over you know the next three days I know I can do a great job on that but that's a different set of skills whereas some people they don't feel like they can do good in front of people but they do really well you know sitting back making the right stuff and that's that and so it's like yeah some people prefer one way over the other uh I one thing I think that could be taken away from this I what I think is really good is that companies maybe should devise an interview that can allow for many candidates you know uh spending the day with the team just to get to know the culture so the question is this what's your take on a take home versus spending the day with the uh with the team to get both the culture the team interactions and all that well it's fake it's always fake uh the reason why First Dates you it's the reason why first States sometimes are really really great in a month and it's awful you know what I mean it's because who you are on a first date versus who you are is very very different okay they're just different and so it's like I don't think you can really get to know like that whole culture get to know people the team processes I just don't think it's quite the same and you do waste a lot of time I would much rather have a person I'd much rather have someone say hey here's a simplified coding challenge go do this don't spend any more than four hours on it that's it uh I don't know to me that I like that better I personally rather have that personal opinion though again you indeed have the right to say no absolutely I've talked about companies perspective but I would warn you against doing that in the interview the reason why I didn't propose uh you to say your company's hiring practices leaves a hash tray in my mind okay I didn't say that uh so no thank you to both your job and your interview process instead I recommend I have to be transparent with you I have bad experiences in the past with coding challenges and I've decided to stop accepting them I mean the problem is is that when you say this you only get how the person accepts it okay so when you're interviewing for a company and you say sorry I've had bad I've had bad I've had bad things with this I no longer accept them if the person takes that as your company sucks that's what they're going to take it as right you only leave it up to the person's interpretation that's that you know what I mean uh the difference here is that you're not judging them for putting them yet well that's the problem again you have no say over how they take it the companies here uh let's see the companies that will be mad at you for stating uh your needs are the minority bullet dodged I agree it is bullet dodged sort of uh again I don't know again this is the hard part is you're expecting a company to change their interview process for you sorry I just don't think that this is a uh I don't think this is a viable strategy so I let's see so I completely stand by my original thesis you have the right to choose when to say no absolutely you always have this right finally I told you that uh see you have the right to say no I didn't advise you to say no all the time so if I here's here's my take on this if you get the take home and it's intentionally vague and it clearly is very very open-ended I would communicate back and say hey my time is minimal and this this exercise is extremely open-ended I I don't want to proceed with this because I'm going to waste a bunch of time and I may or may not even hit the mark of what you want to me that is a fine thing to do you're giving them real feedback and just saying hey this isn't worth it and you're saying really you're telling them this interview is due to and that is okay to say I really do think it's okay to say your interview process is due to and I'm not going to do it but you have to be willing to say no to working at a company you know and that's only works if you are in a place of power already you already have a job or you're financially secure do you know what I mean like that's a very that's not something that anyone can just do it is definitely like I understand that is a very strong position of privilege to be able to say that uh if you only have two to three companies a month that uh interview you your next step is to generate more leads you can procrastinate by saying no on the other hand if you never use your right to say no then that right is pretty useless I don't know I think I think me and this guy will always fundamentally disagree here I think that you're right to say no is dependent on your personal situation problem you can secure these nuts absolutely so that's how I take it uh I don't say no to take home uh let's see let's see I say no to take homes all the time if I already have another job lined up and I just don't care at that point yeah that's reasonable again that's like super reasonable again that's that's that's an entitled take and that's okay to have that in title take I'm not gonna do a take home if someone says hey do this 10 hour take home I'm gonna say no right now why because I already have a great job like your job as an institution is to pull me away from my job to make something even better to somehow make the grass greener so if you're going to say hey I want you to spend 10 hours to see if you even like will pass our bar and then we'll talk if you can leave your job or not no thank you right no thank you I also think you should ask for uh uh pay upfront too you should say what what is the cost and if you really are concerned about your time and you want to make it worth it for you say I'll do this but I cost 100 an hour to program these I'll give you a bill long as you're okay with that then I'll definitely do this right like put some definitions on it if you really think that there's a problem right if you don't want it to be a waste of your time get them to pay it for you right I don't think that that's bad either if I I don't know what Netflix would do if you went to Netflix and said hey I'll do your take home but you need to pay me for my time I don't know they might pay you I have no idea I have no idea but it'd be great now the prime didn't if you read me I genuinely laughed at your video uh and you gave me uh the hope to make a second episode hiring is broken oh man look at this there are so many good ones yeah yeah there was some good ones I did say that I like I like I like the looks of these things I think there's some good stuff I really like what's your current salary is a red flag I think this is actually a pretty cool take I would actually like to read this one anyways so I think me and this guy are both on the same page we understand each other but ultimately at the end I think rejecting an interview for your for a hard line stance is silly rejecting an interview based on your position is less silly uh and realizing that getting your first job so if you're like a first job person getting your first job is one of the most important jobs again do what it takes to get it honestly I I will you know I don't see how how else you're supposed to do that wait Nuance we have to do Nuance yeah real talk if there's a company that I really wanted to work for and they wanted me to do a take home even if it is vague and stuff I would email them and say hey it's super vague this is how I take it this is what I'm gonna take it as I would even clarify why I'm programming it the way I am right like if I really wanted something I would do what it takes to get there you know what I mean you know what I mean the name is the prime engine okay
