hello everyone and welcome recently I attended Northwest Automotive press association's Mudfest which is an event where you test out a bunch of different SUVs and trucks which all have all-wheel drive or four-wheel drive and so at this instead of doing a review on a select few of these vehicles I thought what I would do is one performance test amongst all 27 Vehicles there and so that's what I did and so what I tested was the breaking distance uh on the road from 60 mph to 0 mph I also did a little bit off-road testing uh but we'll get into that later um but one of the more shocking things that I found out through this testing uh was the Nissan Titan which break from 60 mph to zero and 132.5 ft versus a Mini Cooper Countryman which uh breaked from 60 mph to 0 and 134.4 ft so Nissan Titan weighing 5,811 lb outbreak a Mini Cooper weighing 3,629 lb heavy for a Mini Cooper yes but still you know 2,000 some pounds lighter than the Nissan Titan so we've got a lot of questions here and I'm sure you've got a lot of questions here can we trust this information and if we can trust this information how did that Nissan achieve such an incredible stopping distance in comparison so what was the test well the test was very simple they have a little go-kart track which has this long straightaway on it which we were driving uh and I would accelerate past 60 MPH slam the brakes uh and use a full abs stop now I use this device right here to record the 60 to zero time so the second it hits 60 M hour this starts recording and then once hit Zer miles per hour this stops recording and gives you that information uh and so there's a reason why I do that I'll get into why I go past 60 MPH uh in the Titan I accelerated up to 64.7 in the mini I was at 63.5 um now you know part of the thing is can we trust this and what's cool about this even though it's a consumer product and not the professional ones that cost like 5 or 10 grand this still uses about 10 satellites and you can go in online and you know plug in your data and see how many satellites you had locked in on your vehicle so it uses about 10 satellites to exactly locate where your vehicle is and it has a 20 HZ GPS engine so it's accurate to the 20th of a second uh it's updating every 20 times per second and so they say that they can give you speed uh with an accuracy within .1 km per hour which is incredibly impressive this is race logic's Claim about the product and that they can give you g-forces within half a percent uh of you know accuracy so super accurate device even though it is a consumer product um but it's got some pretty impressive Hardware inside of it uh you know the fact that you're using 10 satellites you can get a really good idea of your location so that's how the test was done it's on this uh Road surface which is well-maintained it's an even surface and it was dry for both of these tests now in the video I'll show you of you know what this looks like the morning was a little wet it wasn't raining uh but the track was a little wet there wasn't any standing water or anything like that um but just to ease uh your confidence in this information I did take a Nissan Armada at the beginning of the day and the end of the day once it had gotten completely dry and there was only a twft difference in its stopping distance uh between those two um and so you know not a huge change on the track it looks kind of wet but it really wasn't not really much water on it and when these two were tested it was both later in the day both of them on a dry track okay a lot of variables out of the way let's talk about ABS stopping and so what I've got here is a graph um of G's on the vertical axis and distance on the horizontal axis and so what happens when I slam that brake pedal the G forces of deceleration are going to start to increase and you have this line right here this line right here is the tire's ultimate level of grip that's the maximum grip that that tire can provide um and this line right here of G's is a bit exaggerated but it's to help illustrate the point so when you slam on the brakes you're going to get eventually to that tire grip level it'll go slightly past it and you'll have a certain amount of slip that allows for just slightly higher uh grip and then once you lock that wheel up your grip is going to rapidly decrease and so once that wheel is locked up your abs kicks in and it says whoa hold on let off the brake pressure it Rec catches that tire uh and then lets it continue to rotate and then you go back over back under back over until you finally find you know the perfect area the ABS is trying to hunt down that tire grip limit and just float right there at that limit and so when you slam the brakes uh is extremely important for knowing you know how fast the vehicle stop for that stopping distance for example if you were to hit 60 Mi right here 60 MPH right here and start recording with this little hump right here where you've got you know High higher uh your highest peak grip possible and then you dip down versus if you hit 60 MPH right here where you're still dipping under that because the tire just locked up then you're going to have a longer stopping distance uh if 60 is hit here then if 60 is hit here where you've got that you know Arc where you're stopping a little bit quicker a higher Peak GeForce and you know at 60 MPH every tenth of a second you're going 8.8 ft so super important why uh how that is done now the reason why I accelerated past 60 to 64.7 and 63.5 uh that was just basically the highest speeds I could get to before needing to slam on the brakes uh is I wanted to make sure that we had kind of started to level off in that uh before you know we got to 60 I didn't want to stop just at 60 uh because then who knows what the ABS is doing I want it to be as even as possible um now the professionals at Motor Trend Car and Driver Road and track they're going to use a brake switch a pressure switch on the brake uh it's a a different more expensive way of doing it um it's not a $400 test uh but you can actually get pretty decently accurate results uh in my opinion by doing it this way so break well before 60 have abs kick in uh but there still we will be some variability so if the Titan is able to more accurately find this tire grip limit it may be able to stop faster than if the mini is able to find this tire grip limit of course that tire grip limit can differ depending on the tire both of these have different tires so one of them may be higher than the other and we'll get into that a little bit later on so now we have to discuss can we trust the data of the two stopping distances the 134 for the mini and the 132.0 for the Nissan Titan and so if you look at a graph of the speed versus time data for both of these vehicles what you want to see is a nice linear progression uh from 60 mph down to zero and it can get a little wacky at the very end uh around like 2 mph when your abs sensors when your wheels sensors can't accurately track speed as well uh but at that point you're not really moving much at all you're basically just kind of coming to that final stop uh so it doesn't really add any distance basically what you want to see is from about 60 down to like 5 mph or less a perfect linear curve there and that lets you know that there really wasn't much slipping going on if you did have a little kink in that line uh that would be indicative of the fact that you probably hit a little patch there or just locked up completely started sliding so your G Force wasn't quite as high and then you started dropping back down once ABS figured out hey we're sliding we need to fix this uh so you can look at both graphs for both vehicles and both of them have a nice linear curve so that tells us that we can really trust that data because there was no sliding in either case both of them had a nice linear deceleration okay so here's the part where we continue to talk about tires uh I know I talk about tires all the time but they're fascinating they're super cool and you know there's a tremendous amount of difference out there so the Nissan Titan is on General Grabber AP allterrain tires these are not uh you know basically made for just the road they're made for off-road as well the mini is on pelli chinato that's my best Italian impression p7 tires uh allseason tires so they are really made for the road not made for off-road and actually I did some off-road testing uh the Nissan Titan absolutely destroyed the mini off-road something like uh 10 ft quicker from 20 mph not 60 MPH so it was a hug difference off-road but regardless this is an allterrain Tire used on the road and this is a pelli uh allseason Tire used on the road now Tire Rack coincidentally had some testing on this plli tire and they did it in a bmw328i and they had a 92.3 ft stopping distance from 50 mph so I looked at my data my 50 to Z in the Mini Cooper on the same tires from 50 mph was 92.2 ft so incredibly close and that gave me a lot of confidence in the data uh because Tire Rack basically had the same results so super neat to see um and basically what that tells you is that this plli tire honestly isn't that great looking at the rest of Ty rx's data uh they were comparing this versus three other tires uh breaking both wet and dry this was the worst of the four cornering uh in the this was the worst and in the dry this was coincidentally the best of all those four tires they were testing uh so the one thing that it had going for it was dry cornering uh but it still wasn't all that high 084 GS I mean it's good but it for an all season but it's not you know incredible uh so honestly this tire this pelli p7 tire isn't all that impressive um and these General Grabber tires the fact that they're allterrain tires do really well off-road but also really well onroad is pretty impressive now one final data point Point Motor Trend truck of the year uh for 2017 or I believe it's 2017 is the Nissan Titan and so one of their tests that they do is a 60 to Zer with full payload so whatever the rated payload for this Nissan Titan is something like 1500 lb or so uh they do a a 60 to zero test and they did that in 13383 Ft so a super impressive stopping distance for this Nissan Titan it was the best of the trucks they tested uh and it you know I was speaking with Nissan about this they said the truck has best-in-class braking uh which I believe it has tremendous braking so it's a combination of several things uh it's got great tires it's got great brakes obviously that can handle the stopping uh even with all the weight that's in it and it has a very well-tuned uh vehicle Dynamic control system for the ABS so that you know it hunts down that tire grip limit and it sticks it right there uh keeps it at that grip grip limit so you can get the best possible breaking so super impressive uh work out of the Nissan Titan what they've been able to do with so much weight in a vehicle kind of contradicting what you might intuitively think uh using great tires great brakes and great tuning so thank you guys for watching and if you have any questions or comments feel
