- I rented a $1 million a night hotel room and I also rented this
$1,000 a night cave, this $10,000 a night underwater palace, this $50,000 a night island, and so much more. And we're gonna spend
the night in all of them starting with the world's cheapest hotel all the way in India. Basically, you can rent
these mats for $1 a night. So, I'm gonna give you guys a room tour. See this mat right here? This is my entire room for the night. Oh! It's just like my mattress at home, minus the comfort. So what's the room service like? - Bro, it's a dollar. While we were trying to sleep, people kept stepping over us
in the middle of the night. - Hey
- Hey. - If you didn't believe
we're in a hallway, there you go. These are the price points of
all the hotels we're visiting, and it gets really crazy
towards the end of the video. That was the $1 hotel. Now let's head over to
the $1,000 a night hotel. It comes with two beds, a living room, one bathroom. You could see me while I pee. And it's 200 feet below ground. We literally have this
entire cave to ourselves. - Are there bats here? - No, but the bed does have stains on it. - Hey, I'm gonna be honest with you, at least it's better
than a pad in a hallway. - Apparently, caves don't have Wi-Fi. - We're gonna have to
enjoy each other's company? - So, Chris just got up and left. Where'd Chris go? - It's getting a little creaky. That actually kinda
looks like the entrance to a horror movie. Yeah, I think this is
where we call it a day. - As the night went on, the boys discovered a
keyboard right beside my bed. Oh, no way. Turn the volume up. Oh, I can perform for you guys! - They won't let me sleep. Go away, shut up. - Have you seen my funny bone? - Someone help me. Turns out there's not
much else to do in a cave. Now we really start ramping up. And now we're at the
$10,000 a night villa. - Whoo!
- This place is huge. Boys, let me do the honors. - Allow him. - Oh!
- Oh, my gosh. This place is nice. For $10,000 a night, you get three bedrooms. - Could've done without the
entire forest on my bed. - What's wrong with a little shrubbery? - Bathtubs by the ocean. - Oh, my God. It looks like Chipotle bowl. - It does look like Chipotle bowl. - Access to a private dock. - Look at that. Is this an infinity pool? - Yes, look. It's infinite. - Unlimited food prepared
by a private chef. Let's see if the pizza tastes expensive. - Oh my god. This takes hotels to the next level. - And this isn't even the best part. Behind this door is why
this costs 10 grand. - Oh my God! - The underwater villa. - I feel like I'm in a fishbowl. - We are in a room at
the bottom of the ocean. - Wow, look at those fish! This was worth $10,000. The fish sell it. - Which do you like better? The cave or this? - It's gonna be this. - Look, look at that one! - Oh my god! Hello, sir. - Guys, there's an underwater bathroom. - What?
- I can shower underwater. - Chris, what are you doing? - I feel like an evil villain
contemplating world domination in my underwater base. Guys, I have an idea. Stay right here. I'll be back. - This isn't gonna be good. Oh, there he is! - No way.
- Chris! - Oh my gosh.
- It's a Chris fish. Chris! This is epic! That's a cool looking fish. - As a part of this $10,000 package- - Yeah, this is is so cool. He like floating in the air. - We got jet skis and water jet packs for the whole afternoon. - This is the greatest hotel in the world! - We're now eating in an
underwater restaurant. Shark! - Shark!
- Oh my gosh. - Now we eat fish surrounded by fish. - That doesn't feel right. - Honestly, fish tastes better underwater. - I just wanna make you guys aware that this is just the beginning. We have a $50,000, $150,000, and a million dollar night stay coming up. - How can you afford this? - I'm just gonna lose a
million dollars in this video. It's finally time to go to bed. I laid claim to the fish room, and not gonna lie, it's kinda trippy just
being surrounded by fish. - We still have so many hotels to go to. - Exactly why we need to get some sleep. - All right, good night. - And that was the $10,000 a night hotel. Up next, we have a beautiful
$50,000 private island, and a $50 bus. And I had the boys randomly
pick which they're staying at. - Ah! Enjoy your bus! - While we were on our way to
the $50,000 a night island, I caught something insane on my drone. It's a whale.
- No. - Oh my God. Whoa, I got a really good shot of it. Whoa! - mom! - Dude. - I thought the 50 grand
was getting me a island. How many is included? - 14. - All 14 we can explore? - All 14 you can explore. - This is crazy. - Are they just here
waiting until we show up? - How are you? - How long have you been standing here? - Two years. - No, how long have
you been standing here? - Since eight o'clock in the morning. - I feel bad. - Oh look, this isn't a bus, it's a home. Chandler, you're not gonna
be able to stand, by the way. I don't believe that
this was actually $50. $50. - In addition to 14 islands, we have 12 houses, five swimming pools, and 110 staff on the island waiting on us. Wait, what did you just say? There's 110 people that take care of the three of us? - Yup. - I feel so special. - Apparently up the side
of this little mountain is our little casitas. - Here we are, welcome home. - Holy crap. This is crazy. - Is this Nolan's room?
- Yeah. - Nolan! - I'm not next to this goofball am I? - Nolan! - And you indoor/outdoor shower. - Wait, so I can shower with
this door to outside open? - Yeah. - So what are we supposed to do? - I don't know. - Usually, we would do
like a tour of the place but you can literally see it
all from where we're sitting. Let's see if we can drive this baby. I don't think it works. - Back on the island, we had lunch. Wow, that takes dessert to the next level. Relaxed on a private beach. I haven't felt this peaceful
in a very long time. Took a ride on a private plane. And we ate even more food. Bro, they just keep giving us great food. I decided to give Chris
and Chandler a call to check in on them. What up, Chris? - Hey, what's up? - I'm just gonna say it, this $50,000 a night island is insane. - The bus is hot, it doesn't even start, and there's only one bed! - Sounds like they're
having an amazing time. We'll check in on you
guys in a couple hours. - Hey, check- - I guarantee you he was gonna say, "Hey, check in on these nuts." Play what he just said. - Hey, check in on these nuts. - Dang. - All right, we gotta eat something. - Yeah, we do. - I got an idea. - Somehow, the boys convinced the owner of the Airbnb to tow their bus. - I'm surprised this is going really well. - And we settled down for
an eight course dinner on the beach. What is this? - This is octopus carpaccio. - Octopus carpaccio? - Oh! - Oh.
- Oh! Oh my god! - This place is amazing! - Oh my gosh, we're here. - This crab is fancy. - This crab is eating better than Chris. - All right, we got our McDonald's. Time to get in the bus and
go back to the campsite. - Go back home. - What an incredible day. Probably one of the most fun
I've ever had in my life. As you can see by our list, we're starting to get to the big stuff. These next few is where
the video gets interesting. Up next, I've rented
this entire cruise ship. This behemoth usually
holds thousands of people. But for only $75,000, you can have it all to yourself. But I only have it for one hour, 'cause it's a $500 million cruise ship. And to make this one hour fun, I hid a hundred thousand dollars randomly throughout the cruise ship. Whatever you guys find, you can keep. That's your signal to run. - Let's go! - And while he's looking for money, I wanna tell you about Experian. - I go from here. You go from there? - Experian is a free app that helps you take
control of your credit. Whether you have $1 or $1 million. - Nothing? Nothing. Every corner. - I don't think Jimmy
put money in the trash. - Let's see. - Let's go, let's go! - I find one!
- Woo! $10,000, let's go. - All right, that's a good start. - Experian is a free and easy way to check your credit report, your FICO score, and so much more. - Okay, let me find this $10,000 check. I got one! Okay. - He's got more? - I found two already. - Hey, come over here. Did you know with the Experian boost, you can leverage things
like your utility bill, your cell phone bill, even your Netflix bill to
boost your credit score? - Yep. - Did you actually? - Yeah! - Oh wow. Okay, he knows everything. And by the way, I was holding one of the checks. Here you go. - I'm so nervous, sorry. - Well, go find more! And it gets even better because now, you can even be
rewarded for paying your rent. - Did you see any white board big check? Nothing? - He's a professional
at finding big checks. - Oh wait.
- Woo! - Somehow, after helping
us pay for these hotels, it is still free to
download and sign up for. Just click the link in the description and download Experian right now. How much did you guys find? - 30? 40,000. - I love how they don't even
know how much money they found. With only two hotels left to go, I met up with the boys in Vegas. Now we're at the 150 K
a night hotel package at the Palms Hotel Resort in Las Vegas. There are three rooms. A bowling themed room, a basketball themed room, and an art themed room with
stuff from this famous artist, Damien Hirst. We're gonna let Chandler and our special guest pick the first room. Which one do you want? - Basketball. - Here you go. Have fun boys. In my opinion, Gravy and Chandler had the best room. - This is beautiful. - They had a secret gaming room. - There's a hidden room. - I was just gonna say, like, I can just feel it. It's a door! - They literally had their own butler. - I'm a lucky butler. - And to top it all off, they had their own basketball court. - We made it. - Which room do you two want? - Bowling!
- Yeah! - You sure?
- Yes. - Which means me and you, Chris, are stuck with the medicine room. I Googled the medicine room and it doesn't look fun. - I wanted to bowl. - Kingpin suite! Yo wait, this is actually ridiculous. Strike. Strike, baby! You can't do that! It's against the rules. That is not how this game works. - I won by seven points!
- No! - Where are the beds? Whoa, there's more! - Bunk beds!
- Bunk beds, yes! Nolan, we picked the perfect room. - Let's check out the medicine room. This room has over $16 million
worth of art inside of it. And Chris has no idea. This is a million dollar piece of art. - It looks like my
grandma's medicine cabinet. - When I rented this room, they said, "Whatever you do, "do not touch this." If you try to open it, a security guard will come up. Don't touch it! How much do you think this
collection of pills costs? - $37. - 3.5 million. It's a piece of art. - It's a piece of something. - It says this pool table was 2.3 million. - Are you serious? - No, it's a normal pool table. - Oh, okay. - I love how they're having fun bowling and playing basketball, and we're just like
scared to touch anything. Included in the 150 K package
is the $10,000 dinner. - Wow. - By the way, Chris, how was that bus? You never told me. - I got bit in the face by mosquitoes. - While that was happening, I was getting a massage. How does this compare to the other hotels? - 10 out out of 10 - Oh! - It's been a beautiful
little meal, you know. - Hey, cheers. - I think we can all
agree this meal was great. But the night's not over. After an amazing dinner, me and the boys hung
out in the bowling room. This is called, The Quad Bowl. Hey!
- Oh! - Whoa, we still didn't get a strike. - Yeah! - I think every hotel room
should have a bowling alley. This $150,000 hotel package was insane. I don't know how this
million dollar a night hotel can get any better. And now the moment you've
all been waiting for, the $1 million a night castle. - Dibs on that one. - Let's knock and see what happens. - How's it going?
- Hi. - Hello, everybody! - As soon as we walked in, they gave us each our very own butler. - Nice to meet you.
- There's a lot of people. - Yo, what's up man? I'm digging the hair. This is sick. - Come on up, enjoy the castle. - Whoa, you gotta split the staircase? What the heck? - We're off to a good start. They make foosball tables this long? - They do when you're in
a million dollar castle. - Hey, Nolan. See that ball there? Ah! - Our goal is to give you all
a million dollar experience for the next 24 hours. - This place has six Diamond stars. I didn't think it went above five. - Way more important than that? - Yeah. - Come with me right now.
- It gets better. - It's a dude with milkshakes. - Oh my gosh! - This is worth the
million dollars for me now. - What the heck is this? Is that a robot? - There's literally just dudes
breakdancing here all day? This is sick. - After we saw as much as we could- - No! - They're gonna teach you
how to do this, Jimmy. - Wow. They showed us to our rooms. Show me to my quarters. Thank you.
- Here you are. - Thank you. - Yeah! - I guarantee you, if you cut to Karl, he's gonna say something about
sitting in a bathtub tonight. - Oh my god,. I'm a bath guy. This is ridiculous. - The boys wanted to explore the castle, but I had something else planned. And before we go crazy, I have a surprise for you guys. Bring it in! - Bring what in? - Welcome! Thanks for subscribing. Come on out. What up, man? How's it going? Since you guys are the reason we're able to afford this
castle for the night, we invited four random
subscribers to hang out with us. Everyone pair up and go have fun! Enjoy the million dollar a night hotel. - We're trying to pick out a car, Jimmy. Shut up. - Okay. - I'm gonna die. I do not do heights. - Let's see it! - Wow, Jesus!
- Come back, come back! - Oh my gosh! I did it! Oh my god, that was awesome! - That was pretty cool. - That was the most epic
thing I've ever done! - Look at all these horsies. - Have you ever ridden a horse before? - No, I've never seen a horse. - I'm sorry. How is this happening? - How ridiculous is it that we have these gigantic horses next to this gigantic castle, right? - You wanna go in? - Yeah. - Karl, you're literally riding a horse in a castle right now. - So unreal. - Oh my gosh. Wait, why? - It was an option so I figured, why not? - Hey, we're driving here! Oh, you feel that power? - I'm in a McLaren! - Chris and his subscriber decided to drive a $300,000 car to McDonald's. - Hello. Guys it's me, Chandler, from Mr. Beast. - I wanna be in a Mr. Beast video. - Oh my God, you just were. - Chandler! A membership to this course
costs $57,000 a year. - And I'm playing for free right now. - 'Cause I spent a million dollars. - I'm playing for free. - Why a long face? Ted, please. I just wanna go one foot forward. - Okay, Santa Fe, go! - I like cars more. - I wonder, what does a $1
million a night dinner look like? I love how because we're all here, all our butlers are just
standing over there. You guys can chill. You don't have to be so uptight. Just sit down, get comfortable. How does this castle compare
to all the other places? - Best food? Vegas.
- Agreed. - Okay, best hotel? The private island wins for me. - Didn't see it. Saw a bus. And the lamp doesn't work. And the AC. - My favorite was the
$50,000 private island. Oh my gosh! Whoa! This place is amazing. And you know when you're
paying this much for dinner, it's gonna come with a show. - This is crazy. Wow. - I'm starting to get why
this is a million dollars. - I don't even know what to think. Rich people are crazy. And after that was done, they gave us a grand finale. See all those green dots out there? Those are drones. All right. They're going up.
- This is incredible. - Oh my god, they are dabbing! - Oh!
- No! - Oh my gosh! - What's he doing to that guy? It's a briefcase full of money! - This is insane. Yo, fireworks better
count their days, bro. Wow. - Oh no. Why? - Oh my gosh, bro. I know this doesn't look real, but that is real. - That was great. We spent weeks traveling
all over the world. I hope you guys enjoyed
