hello everyone and welcome in this video we're going to be talking about disconnecting sway bars and more specifically electronic disconnecting sway bars now if you don't know how anti-roll bars work or anti-sway bars work i have a separate video explaining that in this video we're simply going to be talking about the mechanism which allows it to disconnect and then why you may want to do this so here we're looking at a electronic disconnecting sway bar you've got the sway bar itself you've got the disconnect portion and then you've got the electric motor there which is going to actuate that disconnecting and so looking inside of this here kind of an exploded view of what's going on we've got these uh two portions of the sway bar each of these have essentially what is a gear on the end of them and then you have this collar in the center which has an internal spline so this works a lot like a manual transmission actually which is kind of cool how they relate you've got this shift fork here and your electronic motor right here and so that motor is going to be your actuator which pushes this shift fork back and forth you've got a return spring here so normally the sway bar is going to be fully connected and then when you push the button to disconnect what's going to happen is this electric motor here is going to push this shift fork against this return spring that's going to force this collar which is generally going to be over both of these two gears holding them together so they both rotate together as you can see it's wide enough this is just an exploded view so they'll actually be touching nearly in this and so then this is going to push back over this collar right here the collar will push back over this gear and then it will no longer be connected to this portion of the anti-roll bar and so those two portions of the roll bar are free to move about they won't move together now an interesting thing to note is how this goes back together once you want to reconnect the sway bar so if you disconnect and then they move all about you obviously want to make sure that when they reconnect they're at the same plane and back to where you started you don't want to have this like natural torque that's always occurring on that roll bar you want to make sure that they're positioned accordingly and so you will have a position sensor in here that will you know it won't allow you to reconnect to re-engage that sway bar unless the position is correct and also you can rely on a mechanical setup this collar if you look at the internal spline you'll have a unique spline so that can only go in one way so it'll only reconnect if you have these perfectly parallel with each other so you're not creating that offset with the anti-roll bar so when would you want to have that roll bar engaged well basically you want the roll bar engaged for stability especially for high speed stability and this is going to prevent body roll where this comes in handy is when you're off-road and you need more articulation of your axle so when you disengage it you won't you will have you know essentially a softer suspension and so that's going to allow you to have more articulation from the front to the left side from your left wheel to your right wheel and so you'll have you know you'll be able to go over larger obstacles things like that the technical way that this is described is that it increases its ramp travel index and so the rti is a ratio of the distance which you travel up a ramp traditionally 20 degree ramp uh before that rear wheel lifts up in the air before any wheel lifts up in the air and typically it's going to be the wheel behind the wheel which is going up the ramp so as it's going up the ramp you're taking the ratio the distance that it travels up that ramp divided by the vehicle's wheelbase multiplied by a thousand this is just a way of measuring articulation and so on the vehicle which we're showing here this has a disconnecting sway bar and by disconnecting that sway bar you can increase its ramp travel index from 423 with it fully engaged to 510 with the sway bar disconnected so a significant change in how much articulation is going to allow by disconnecting that sway bar so thank you guys for watching and if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below you
