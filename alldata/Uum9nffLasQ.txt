hello everyone and welcome in this video we are talking about what is faster the porsche tycoon turbo s or the tesla model s performance now porsche says the tycon turbo s is good for 0 to 60 in 2.6 seconds and has a top speed of 161 miles per hour tesla says the model s performance is good for 0 to 60 in 2.4 seconds and has a top speed of 163 miles an hour we're done right tesla's faster not so fast my ti-83 plus disagrees cheap me nope sprung for the plus so here's what i think i think take the porsche take the tesla put them both at a stop light which one's going to be quicker off the line i think it's going to be the porsche and in this video i'm going to explain why so the first thing we're going to look at is wheel torque which one of these two vehicles has more torque at the wheels and so both of these vehicles have two electric motors one in the rear one in the front for the porsche there is a combined torque porsche claims of 1050 newton meters now thanks to david tracy of jalopnik we know that the torque split is 610 newton meters in the rear and 440 newton meters in the front tesla in their owner's manual states that the model s performance has 720 newton meters in the rear and 420 newton meters up front now wheel torque isn't just about how much torque the motor makes you also have to pass that through a gearbox in the case of the porsche turbo s they actually have two gears so first gear in the rear has a gear ratio of 15.563 super aggressive and then the front gear ratio is 8.05 now for the tesla model s it's about 9.734 in the rear and 9.325 in the front so if we want to look at wheel torque total wheel torque for the vehicle we take our torque we multiply it by the gear ratio and then we add the torque from the front multiply that by the gear ratio so we can compare the two here so looking at the turbo s we do the math and that comes out to 1335 newton meters now porsche states that the wheel torque of this porsche ticon is almost 12 000 newton meters so i'm assuming that's as a result of some losses that it will have through the drivetrain so the theoretical being at 13 000 and then the actual being almost at 12 000 newton meters now for the tesla here the theoretical limit multiplying this and then adding this multiplied right here gives us 10 925 newton meters and then you'll of course have some losses for the purpose of this video we're going to pair these exact numbers rather than looking at the numbers with losses and something to keep in mind here remember when the tesla roadster came out elon hyped up quite a bit that it had 10 000 newton meters of wheel torque well porsche is stating at the wheels they're going to have 12 000 newton meters almost so already more than what elon claimed about the tesla roadster which is not yet out i suspect the tesla roadster will actually have more than 10 000 newton meters if it's going to be as quick as tesla claims it is going to be so from here we can see that the porsche tycon has a torque advantage the thing that we don't know is is it actually quicker because we have to take into consideration the size of the tires we have to take into consideration the vehicle weight and we have to take into consideration the torque curve how long does this peak torque actually last in the tesla versus the ticon and so that's what we're going to compare for the rest of this video moving on to wheels and tires now what we're trying to figure out is what is the actual force that is pushing the vehicle we know the wheel torque but that doesn't tell us the force pushing the vehicle because we have yet another gearing mechanism which is the size of our tires so if we look at the torque being applied to the wheels you can see that torque is a function of force multiplied by radius so if we're trying to find the force at the wheels then we have to take torque and divide it by our radius now what does that mean well that means if your radius is smaller the force you'll be applying to the ground will be larger and so we can look at the different sizes for the front and rear tires of both the turbo s and the tesla you can see the turbo s has wide 265's up front 305s in the rear the tesla has 245s up front 265s in the rear so the ticon does have noticeably wider tires and the radiuses are going to be somewhat similar so in the front the tesla is going to have a slight gearing advantage 0.3524 meters versus the porsche tycoon in the rear the rear has a slightly smaller radius on the ticon meaning it will have a slight gearing advantage so what do we do to calculate the actual force at the wheels well we take the wheel torque at the front this multiplied by this divide it by the radius at the front this number right here add that to the rear and then that will give us our combined rating of the force that the porsche tychon turbos can actually push along with theoretically which is 36.4 kilonewtons do that same math for the tesla based on its specs and it's 10925 newton meters of torque and you get 30.6 kilonewton force so this is actually the porsche here a 19 greater peak force that it is capable of pushing this tycon along with which is quite a significant difference okay so now let's determine the peak acceleration that's theoretically possible for each of these two vehicles and here's where we run into a big problem with the porsche 2323 kilograms it's super heavy wait don't worry it doesn't actually matter that all much because guess what the tesla at 2241 kilograms is also super heavy so if we want to calculate acceleration we start off with our level equation force equals mass times acceleration from that we derive acceleration equals force divided by mass you take that mass multiply it by gravity you can get your acceleration in g's and so using the porsche as our example here we calculated 36 400 newtons for the force we divide that by its mass multiplied by gravity and we get 1.60 g's doing this same thing for the tesla here we calculated 30 600 newtons right over here we divide that by 2241 multiplied by 9.81 and we get 1.39 g's uh-oh so even though the porsche is heavier still a significant difference in acceleration that it is capable of now that doesn't mean it will actually put this down we've got some assumptions here so first of all we're ignoring load transfer uh for this now i did a little bit of math it's not all that complicated to add this in the thing is both of these vehicles have very similar weight distributions they're both about 50 50. so using load transfer doesn't change things all that much so we're just going to ignore it for this video we're also assuming there's no grip limit we're looking at having infinite traction essentially in this video which there does not exist in the real world so can a tire out there a street tire put down 1.6 gs from zero miles per hour uh unlikely with today's technology so that is something that we will need to touch on and then the other thing that we need to touch on here is that we have no rpm limit to our torque meaning we have essentially infinite power so that's the next thing we're going to get into here but one of the things is going to be okay well what about tires here and so from a tire comparison yes the porsche is heavier which is worse but it's only 3.6 percent heavier and it has 15 percent wider tires in the rear and eight percent wider tires up front so i think from a grip standpoint the porsche will actually have the advantage which is why i'm okay ignoring this grip limit here now let's move on to the torque curves so porsche actually provided jalopnik with their torque curve which is fascinating to look at and it's actually really cool the shift strategy that porsche uses so essentially they allow that rear axle to remain in first gear all the way to 100 kilometers per hour and then after that it switches giving them the best possible 0 to 60 times so what we're looking at here on the left is torque up to 12 000 newton meters so here's total combined torque of the vehicle you can see it starts to taper off at about 50 kilometers per hour or about 30 miles per hour here in purple we have first gear torque for the rear axle we have second gear torque for the rear axle and then we have first gear torque the only gear for the front axle so that blue is just a combination of whatever you're in and as you can see it's beneficial to remain in first gear up until you get to about 100 kilometers per hour and then you switch over to that second gear for the rear which if you are to be in because of its ratio of 8.05 peak wheel torque acceleration gs in second gear assuming you have all the torque available is 1.03 g so significantly lower once you switch over to second gear now what we have here is an estimation of what's going on with tesla so we don't know i haven't seen an accurate torque curve of what the tesla model s performance looks like but one thing that is commonly true with electric motors is that you have peak torque exist all the way until you hit peak power and then you start to have torque drop off so if we assume that peak torque and peak uh horsepower occur at the same rpm then we can calculate using that knowledge and the equation horsepower equals torque times rpm divided by 5252 to figure out what speed would this actually occur at and yes it's a guesstimate we don't know for sure but that speed is about 70 kilometers per hour or about 43 miles per hour for the purpose of this video we're going to be very kind to tesla we're just going to assume that it can maintain that peak torque for both motors all the way up to 100 kilometers per hour why because the porsche is still going to be all right so if we want to calculate how long does it take to get from 0 to 30 miles per hour or 0 to 60 miles per hour in other words 50 kilometers per hour or 100 kilometers per hour we take the change in time is equal to the change in velocity divided by acceleration so that's the equation we're using to calculate these times velocity is equal to acceleration multiplied by time so the porsche ticon because it's able to maintain that peak torque basically get all the way until 30 miles per hour it's getting those peak g's that entire duration so it's 0 to 30 time is 0.86 seconds versus the tesla which is going to be at 0.98 seconds and so here's why you start to see that yes i do believe at a stoplight the porsche tycoon is going to win the race now unfortunately that porsche tycoon's torque starts to drop off at about 50 kilometers per hour it's quite a steep drop off but and so we can still calculate what is its zero to 60 going to be assuming that it reaches its final torque of about 1.03 gs at the end so it's starting at about 1.6 when it's at 50 kilometers per hour once it gets to 100 kilometers per hour then we're down to about 1.03 g so we're going to take the average of that and doing the math using that average we get a 0 to 60 time of 1.90 now remember this is theoretical it doesn't include aerodynamic losses powertrain losses that kind of thing but we're doing this comparing theoretical to theoretical to see which one could actually be quicker doing that same math for the tesla again assuming it has its peak torque the whole way up to 60 miles per hour we get 1.96 seconds so in either scenario here off the line it's going to be a bit quicker to 60 i i believe it will actually still be quicker and then beyond that it is very difficult to predict because we don't know what's going to be happening with each of the motors with the aerodynamics with the efficiency of the motors there's all kinds of variables that are going to start to come into play after you get past 60 miles per hour or about 100 kilometers per hour so what have we learned well if there's going to be a stoplight race between a tesla model s performance and a porsche tycoon turbo s then you know assuming there's not all that much grip outside it's going to be a dead even race assuming there is plenty of grip for both of these to be able to do their thing the ticon is going to get the edge at a stoplight race up to 30 miles per hour for sure and then past that it starts to get questionable we don't really know what's going to go on and so now this is the moment where all of you tesla fanatics can happily bring up tri-motor and plaid mode and all that other stuff but regardless i think very cool to look at you know using a transmission you know if you add these two numbers together it is less than these two numbers right here and yet it's able to put down more wheel torque through gearing through using a transmission so by using that two-speed transmission there are performance advantages of doing so and i think that's super cool and super cool to analyze regardless of who actually is the quicker car out there so thank you all so much for watching and if you have any
