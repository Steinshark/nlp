whoa okay I did this video many years ago hello everyone welcome back to my videos I'm really excited to talk to you guys today about coding boot camps it feels like forever ago and at the time this was when coding boot camps were honestly in their Prime I remember telling people I was going to a coding Boot Camp or had just finished one and so much interest was around coding boot camps and I thought I would do an updated version fast forward to years later as you know I've continued my career in Tech and you know software development and many different roles well not really that many different roles but we'll get to that in a sec here the purpose of this video though is I wanted to have a very candid conversation with you is are coding boot camps worth it in 2024 are coding boot camps still worth it this year I mean nowadays with tech we see it moving so fast and the tech industry what what is that can you see that back there oh now it's yeah what is that I think it's just a light anyways okay back to reality as I was saying though so the reality is I I feel like the industry has shifted so much and the demand for different roles has shifted some up some down and I thought as I was scrolling thinking what do I want to talk to you all about what do I want to you know do I want to do an in-depth video like what what's the concept for this next video and this one I stumbled across and I thought you know what it's time to do an updated version I'm very candid and sometimes the candid ones are what you appreciate the most I mean they're all candid but but just sit down and have a conversation so you know if you watched my video a few days ago you would recognize this room I'm here in Las Vegas actually for service now's conference we just finished the last day it was so much fun one of my favorite things I got to do is actually see the COO and president of service now speak with the CEO and co-founder of Nvidia I mean that to me it was like I'm not a celebrity person but that was really cool moment just hearing their thoughts on the future of tech but anyways that's a side note I just want to share it looks very different than my typical setup all right let's dive into the topic though first up before I share with you exactly my thoughts around is it worth going to a coding Boot Camp or even getting into software development in 2024 different things like that I mean I think I would hope you know the answer is yes it's it's a booming industry still but there's so much more intricacies to it and the fact that we are asking these questions or that I'm getting asked it a lot in my messages and my DMs means that there's something going on here and we really need to talk about that taking a step back though when I first went to coding boot camp the purpose was as many as it's for many of you who want to go or are considering going today which is essentially at the time I wanted a career change I wanted to get into Tech I was coming from Fashion as many of you know I wanted to get into to coding I just finished going to school for four years at University for graphic Communications management which is more on the graphic design thing design side of things and I thought to myself you know what this coding thing is so cool you can build whatever you want it's it was just so empowering I just remember those feelings of and I'm sure many of you have felt that way who are coders so fast forward to now you know I went to a coding boot camp it was almost 8 years ago which is wild and insane to think about and you know I've worked at small companies I've worked at big companies like IBM now I'm Consulting for a lot of very big tech companies many of you are familiar with and it's just wild how interesting this journey has been and then I got today this message where someone asked you know is it worth getting into Tech still Tiff should I go to a coding boot camp like what how do I break into the industry so I wanted to share my thoughts around that the first thing is it really depends what your goals are coding boot camps have become so popular the last few years there are so many things you need to look out for with things like coding boot camps you know if you really think about the quality of the boot camp where are these grads going to school that's the number one thing like looking at What what schools are these graduates going to or sorry not what schools are going to what jobs are they going to after they graduate are they related to what they're studying the other thing too I would say is who is teaching these classes look at their credentials before just randomly picking and coding boot camp the other thing to I I think is more important than ever is going into a coding boot camp with a very specific intention when I went into my C and that's not something I did when I went into mine when I went into my coding boot camp I was just like I want to learn to code simple as that and then I want to get a job simple as was that I didn't know if I wanted to do front end I didn't know if I wanted to do back end and at the time that was okay because there was it was a booming industry there was so much demand and it was much honestly at that point it was much easier to get hired for a junior role fast forward to today although the industry is booming and there are so many open roles I mean it's continuing to increase the reality is it's harder than ever or the last few years anyways to get a job for a junior individual and I think there's many reasons for that which we can cover in other videos but it's just something that I think we need to be transparent about and this video would not be accurate if I said otherwise so how do you navigate that then one of the biggest things though if you are someone who is thinking of going to a coding Boot Camp or boot camp in general is nowadays I would really recommend that you need to have a very specific Niche going into it so this might be cyber security data analyst data uh scientist anything like that but I think gone are the days at least for now where you can just go to a coding boot camp and kind of figure out what you want to do afterwards that is still possible but because it is such a competitive market right now I think it's more important than ever to go in with a very specific Niche now this is even relative to if you went to school for computer science or are looking for a job in general now what I've been seeing more and more of is the shift towards very specialized areas so rather than just being a full generalist when you are a junior starting in with a very specific Niche will really help you land a job at a quicker Pace because you're were able to build this very specific role that companies are looking for and having this background in those situations going to a coding boot camp I think is totally still worth it as long as you do what I said where it's you're actually making sure that it's a good coding boot camp by seeing where the grads work who is teaching these courses where do they work or where have they worked answering all these questions doing your due diligence because now there are so many that can kind of feel like you know you don't want to choose the wrong boot camp okay I hope that answers your questions a little bit around is it still worth getting into going to a coding Boot Camp or even the matter of fact getting into Tech and you know although the job market right now isn't great the news likes to highlight that social media likes to highlight that there are still so many opportunities high paying opportunities within the industry now I'm not sitting here saying if you're a job Hunter you're probably being like Tiff it's taking me forever to find a job I mean I was speaking with students a while back and they were saying how they've been searching for months but that isn't honestly that new even when I was job hunting I remember it took months to find a job the right job especially when you were fresh out of school whether it be computer science or coding boot camp I mean I think we live in a society now where we expect everything to be instant you know we want food We call we text text oh my goodness we order on Uber we want a movie we go on Netflix like these anything we want is so instantaneous that having to work for something like your first job feels almost like well it's never going to happen and listen I'm not sitting here being naive getting your J first job is much harder than it was when I was getting my first job many years ago in Tech but the reality is every time I speak to someone it takes a few months but you will land a good job once you get your first job it's much easier to continue on now one of the best ways though think something that a coding boot camp still really offers that maybe if you are just self- teing doesn't offer as much is the networking aspect the fact that when you were going to a coding boot camp you are able to build that community that support system for me that was huge it was something I really needed because I was self-teaching and I could have gone that way for a little bit but a I wasn't disciplined enough I wouldn't have really immersed myself in the tech to the point where um I was skilled enough to get a job and then the second thing is I kept on hitting roadblocks especially when you're learning to code you will you you need that Community or those teachers there to really help you and and bring you up as well so I think that alone the network and Community aspect of coding boot camps is still worth it now if you are someone who is able to get that outside of going to a coding boot camp and I'm generalizing when I say coding boot camps I'm saying when I say coding boot camp it's referring to um all the different Niche boot camps you know cyber security um I I keep on bringing that up because I think it's such a Hot Topic right now but if you're able to self- te and then on the side build your network through reaching out to people going for cof coffee that is so valuable as well and you can still do it that way I just feel like it's much harder especially as we get older and we have more responsibilities it's almost as though we need that to be forced into something like a coding boot camp where you can simply you know have this intense period of time in your life where you're learning a lot versus just kind of trucking along okay I know that was a little bit of a ramble but I really wanted to just have a very authentic and candid conversation with you as to how I'm seeing coding boot s and them evolve over time to sum it up yes it is still worth it focus in on an area though before you go to one I because I think that will really help you land your first job more seamless second thing is finding a job right now is hard no one's saying otherwise but if you can get more specialized skills it will be much easier Tech is still booming despite what we like to think sometimes it's you know if you look at the data it is still increasing yes there are a ton of layoffs happening at some of the big Tech companies but more mid to smaller sized companies they are hiring so much right now still so don't give up I mean Tech is the future it's threaded throughout every single industry so it's very safe bet that it's not going anywhere by the time it does go somewhere I think all jobs will be gone and we'll just be on the beach I'm just joking anyways thank you all for watching and make sure to hit that subscribe button for more Tech coding AI future Tech all the good stuff leave in the comments what you're studying what topics you want to see next who you want me to bring on next maybe a specialized cyber security person anything like that let me know all right see you all soon bye everyone [Music]
