ladies and gentlemen I regret to inform you that once again Magnus Carlson has done something that warrants a YouTube video now I know what you're thinking Gotham you would make a video of Magnus Carlson breathing you would make a video of this man walking from his house to the local Metro station do they have metros in Norway I don't know I think they all fly on spaceships my friends that's not the point even though you are correct yesterday Magnus Carlson decided to log into chess.com and defeat a very strong grandmas from Croatia by the name of Leon levich hopefully I'm pronouncing that correctly and he defeated him nearly 20 times in a row Magnus won 18 to1 and the reason that Magnus decided to do this is because he is chasing the number one rank on chess.com in Blitz which is right now hikaro 3,334 and Magnus is trying to get that and yesterday he did by getting to 3,300 he he didn't break it he got very close and so in today's video I'm going to show you what it's like to beat a 3,000 rated Grandmaster 18 to1 because you know what you enjoy this and I enjoy this and I don't know what we're all complaining about you know how many of you enjoy watching a sport wouldn't you be sad the day that your favorite athletes retire right whether it's jokovic or it's Tyson Fury or it's somebody in baseball or it's somebody in football or the other football the real football the one you play with your feet not the one that you throw you know any of those we got to respect the Legends while they're here and U listen I am sorry to Le uh to to Leon uh Lich he's a really good dude has courses out there uh but but he but he's getting featured in this video cuz like I don't even I I mean this is like ridiculous and not only Magnus was not even playing real openings bro he was playing this what even is this this this doesn't even have a name this doesn't even have a name if you open a chess.com analysis board and you play D4 C6 the Queen's Gambit in B5 he straight up plays an opening that doesn't have a name I mean maybe I don't know maybe in some of you will find this this is like a a drunk caroan this is like a Caro a Caro Kant K all right that was very dangerous to being a bad word you know I was talking about Emanuel K the uh philosopher uh Economist I don't know what is he what even is this come on man what is he doing and his opponent takes and and and Magnus just you know develops like it's normal and why is he able to play this garbage and look at this now he gets the bishop and this Pawn can't even be taken because of the Counterattack on the center and then he just gets the bishop he just has the two Bishops the pawn is still hanging for God's sake and lon's not taking it because if you take the pawn on B5 yes for a moment you attack the bishop but then look at this now your Bishop is hanging you said Ley what's the big deal I just play Knight C3 now you can't Castle you're never going to Castle now and black is going to go Bishop you know like C5 Castle it's I I I I mean he invents openings it's like unbelievable how how how he makes these play and now the Pawn's an asset I mean I mean it was a weakness now it's an asset now it goes to B4 and um he he gets an imbalanced structure his King moves it doesn't even matter look at it he gets checked his King slides over as if the whole thing was planned cuz it was now he's a pawn up now he plays E5 and just has incredibly coordinated pieces looks for the queen trade to get into the end game loses a pawn but his opponent is just taking too much time he's got 39 seconds it doesn't matter if his opponent is going to end up in a decent position his opponent's got no time Magnus just a minute up in a Blitz game and slowly but surely he does manage to win it even though the first game was actually Leon did a great job he just has 7 seconds and you know ended up losing on time and in the game now Magnus uh then uh Magnus won 11 games in a row to start this thing okay he won 11 which means um which means he did what we call adopt he adopted uh his opponent uh and uh that that that's just that's just the term I think it was really I think it was invented by the ogs of Chess streaming the chess bras so when you beat somebody 10 times you you basically become their adopted uh parent so that's uh I I feel like in two years you're going to like people will get canceled for saying this I I I don't know I just feel like because they're going to be like what what what is the Foster system a joke to you like are orphans a joke to like no it's just a friendly I don't know anyway that's what it's called it's called adopting like adopting a pet now I'm not saying people are pets okay oh my God speech Just impossible now Magnus plays my opening I I didn't invent this opening uh but uh this is the papa tulot gamb this is actually a recommendation of mine in the E4 course uh which I have my OG course it's a Gambit by white you play into the French defense you lose this pawn pawn takes E4 and then instead of playing Queen E2 which just tries to win but Magnus plays G4 G4 is not the best move but it doesn't matter because he's Magnus Carls and he decides what's the best move and what's not the best move he gets the pawn back and look at this roaring attack and now Magnus is going to go here and here and he's he's just going to mate his opponent like Leon uh Leon doesn't have a choice like is very very very important but in chess you just go for checkmate like you don't you you don't that's not what you do in in in chess in IRL absolutely 100% uh unequivocally is that the right word important life lesson for everybody but in chess it's a competition you are trying to win and Checkmate is a very good thing and uh yeah this is not looking healthy this is not this is not he's going for Queen G7 and uh yeah I mean KN Knight F3 this he's just I mean it it is it's bad it's he's got all the pieces pointed at at at Leon's position and to his credit lon's actually defending pretty well he's kicking out the queen and Knight F4 but I mean it really just is a matter of time and now D4 I mean everybody in magnus's position is ready to go he also could have played Knight F6 check right away uh takes takes and then you know just slowly gotten there he can't rush cuz Queen F6 but uh he would have slowly made his way there and uh he plays Knight F6 and the game is Just over uh he just avoids you know that and uh Knight G5 and yeah I mean a trifecta of threats which cannot be parried Magnus plays Bishop takes F7 Bishop takes and checkmates his young opponent in 22 moves and that is the danger of when you Castle into this absolute monstrosity of an attack look at this I mean Leon was just like all right I'm going to Castle because those are the good principles of the game uh but Bishop D3 and I just a monster Monster game now at some point Magnus started getting bored so against the E4 he started playing this I mean come oh my God you think that's bad he played Knight C7 he's playing the de Brer defense he's playing a Carl Khan but he's not even playing D5 he's not even playing D5 and if you think that this is wait wait wait till you see what's next I mean normally it's Knight C7 and then you play D5 but now if you play D5 white actually has a very nice support there so instead of that Magnus just plays G6 he just he just basically says you know what my my knight my knight is good here now Leon's doing the principal thing he's developing all of his pieces no oh no no way Magnus plays Knight H6 and if Queen D2 to Target the Knight you know you're going to go Knight G4 so you don't want to do that so to stop this leyon plays this which makes a lot of sense and now this man Magnus plays F6 no oh my God bro he did he did the same thing on both sides he moved his Knight out to the edge moved the flank pawn and put the Knight behind the pawn he has made eight moves and now he just castles he just castles he has three pawns on the sixth round and basically what Magnus is doing is this he's just fighting without fighting like he's just standing like this and like you got to hit him you got to punch him right so Leon plays Here and Now Magnus plays D6 I mean he he's just waiting for his opponent to do something and while the opponent doesn't do something now Magnus plays F5 so from this position suddenly he just jabbed you like right in the face you're like oh my God what he wasn't even doing anything and all of a sudden you know black is opening up on the file and this is a terrifying sight like most people see this coming and they just Panic they like they don't know what to do me I would he takes on F5 Bishop takes F5 Magnus activates some pieces but he's got some weaknesses duh cuz he played like this of course he has weaknesses because he played like this now Bishop takes a five Bishop H6 he takes the diagonal Lyon comes back but now white also has a weakness now Magnus plays E5 a very very big move trying to gain space he gets pushed back now look at Leon Leon's playing this game very very decently but now Magnus plays A5 so immediately everything that white is doing black is trying to take advantage and out of nowhere Magnus doesn't even have a disadvantage anymore it's point2 how did that happen now the only way to prove anything here for white is to keep moving forward you got to keep moving forward you got to take you got to play D6 you got to weaken this right Magnus takes and immediately activates his Queen he immediately activates his Queen the pawn on C5 is weak white UND develops white tries to bring these Knights back as well Magnus defense def his Knights the knights dance out that way now it looks like Lon is making some good progress here he is doing a lot of good but here comes Magnus Queen C4 very close game this is the best position that Lyon's had so far Queen d8 the Queen B uhoh uhoh Rook A1 yeah this is a really wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute apparently there's Knight takes H3 there's a sacrifice in this position and if you take black has Knight H5 and queen G5 and The Rook is coming in oh my goodness but Magnus goes the other way Magnus misses it and he's losing the pawn on B7 but he's going for counterplay against the king Lyon's up on time this is his best opportunity the entire game look at Magnus say Knights go Rook A7 hitting but black defends and as quickly as his position was bad his position suddenly Comes Alive Lyon has ran into a brick wall in the form of the light squared Bishop the pawn is two squares away from queening but it's blocked this is blocked the knights can't actually do anything and you know what is about to do everything all these pieces Here Comes Knight takes H3 Here Comes Queen E3 check black ravages the white position and delivers a Checkmate and that Rook relinquished the defense of the bishop if this was taken it would be made on the next move for black it would either be backwards and latter mated here H there you might survive because your king would run out to G5 and King F6 would also lead to check man on E7 so oh he wins again oh it was so close Leon was so close but magnus's defense is too good and uh he had him shook he had him shook you you know how shook he had him he won four games then Magnus again played a B3 this was a sicilian and here you know he played Bishop B5 he developed everything was good Magnus played D4 he hadam shook you know how I know he hadam shook he had Leon Mouse slipping Bishop D6 Magnus played Knight D4 trying to create an attack Rook C1 C4 maybe A3 B4 B5 ideas taking with the queen getting to A7 all this good stuff and in this possession he played Knight F5 Magnus took on C6 obviously black is playing Queen C6 Leon played Queen C7 and uh yeah that that's unfortunate that is unfortunate he he loses game number five like that I mean listen sometimes you're shook sometimes you play in Magnus you losing half the games probably having a good time though I would imagine you are having a good time when you play Magnus now Magnus would not stop I mean dude just kept firing away and the thing is I'm going to show you a few games where he actually played seriously and it was wild like watching Magnus goes from this goofy stuff to like the level difference is spectacular and this is not a knock on Leon because he's he's a very very very good player I actually Wonder have I played Leon have I played Le I've never I've never played Leon so this is I guess uh some sort of new account uh maybe I I played him on an old account but I've I've never played Leon on Elsa uh why is his name Elsa by the way he likes uh Frozen why is 167 it's not like like his rating anyway Magnus once again goes for the exact same setup this time defending over here protecting the queen side and then when white tries to instant he just plays the pawn forward and so okay so you you're not going to develop your knight to that square very normal game right very solid game Knight goes out to A5 putting some pressure right here white trades the Knight because it's very annoying Knight E4 and now we we we got a Horseless game right nobody likes horses Bishop D6 the position locks completely and Leon must have just been thinking look I mean if I get Magnus in a position like this there's no way he can beat me right look just queens and Bishops and a completely locked structure and I control the only diagonal and I will control the only open file I can't lose watch how brutal it is to play against Magnus even in the most dead position Bishop C5 and queen D6 so he's just keeping the tension he wants you to take so he could activate his Queen you're not going to take right see okay F3 oh Magnus making you take no you defend yourself D6 takes takes and now Magnus has no Queen trade okay it's a completely equal position I mean there is literally nothing to be done white plays H4 Magnus plays King f8 Magnus doesn't like overc committing his pawns and o h look at that he doesn't like overcommit his pawns but he's asking a few questions here and he plays F4 check now there is one thing brewing in this position that is hidden I don't think you realize it do you realize what is the hidden element of this position yes that is a question pay attention what is the hidden element of this position it is the fact that at the end white has six pawns on light squares black has six pawns on dark squares maybe even seven he'll maybe even put that one there as well in the future why is this important if at any point this bishop manages to get in at at at any moment you know might go might go off take a it's going to it's going to the game ends instantly instantly because all of White's pawns are on the wrong color Magnus knows that Magnus is playing for the end game like 20 moves down the line when these guys get into a Scramble now he offers a queen trade why does he offer a queen trade now because he has a better endgame chance and because now his King can run right white goes Bishop B5 but Magnus comes this way first and then he comes all the way to H5 forcing G3 and now takes and now G5 uhoh if take take black has a pass H Pawn out of nowhere black has created a full Pawn that will run down the board and this is winning do you know why this is winning because after H5 Bishop B5 black will play H4 now this pawn it doesn't even have to go any further because I will just play King F4 but the real winning idea is in the future H3 H2 and I deflect look I play H3 let's say you come here I'll play H2 you defend me I promote I told you the pawns are on the wrong color so G5 Bishop B8 check and Leon falls asleep at the wheel Bishop A6 Magnus plans ahead and that is game over and Leon just resigns he just resigns his Bishop is now offside confirmed by V and it's over how Magnus finds a way to win this position with black is is is stupidity at the highest level it's it's absurd it's absurd it's the smallest details it's this like little F pawn move you know and and white doesn't feel comfortable splitting and ruining that defense so he allows the pawn to come to F4 now Magna says let's trade the Queens let's trade the Queens because my Bishop despite looking like it's doing nothing he controlling very important squares and then when I split these pawns up like this G5 gives me winning chances and that's the now Magnus and by the way I will show you the one game at the end that Leon won okay so don't go anywhere this is what happens when Magnus plays seriously okay um let me show you I'm I'm going to show you this game th th this game I'm I'm going to actually analyze fully because it's a fascinating game Magnus did not play stupid openings the entire time in this game he played the Catalan he decided to play a real opening while mixing in goofy stuff because if any of you have ever trained with like a like one-on-one with a coach and the coach is kind of messing around playing at your level and then they start they start playing at their level oh there's nothing spookier all right so Bishop B4 and this line where black takes and Magnus just gives away the pawn this is very normal for the Catalan for white to just give away the pawn here try to win it back but more so than winning it back you just make black play very passively like notice how Leon he knows what he's doing but he's got all these pawns here he's got the bishop and Magnus just focuses on the center right Knight E4 the knight's Galloping into the position Knight bd7 Magnus plays Bishop E3 look at this congestion but there's there's almost no congestion at all I mean you're about to open up the center and completely destroy the black position Knight takes C4 Magnus plays Knight takes D7 zuk a zuk because you know this Knight is not going anywhere so an in between move capture hits this forces the king to move Queen E4 and now watch as Magnus slowly methodically works the position to Perfection Queen A6 Rook D1 surely he's not going to go D5 he can't go D5 because this is very well protected but the king is here what are you going to go if you play Rook d8 with the intention of going this way I'll cut you off I'll cut you off before you get there but let's not even you know like I can play a queen B5 and now this is really softened up and I'm I'm going to just point my Rooks at it I also have Queen G4 whenever I want who's going to guard the pawns right who's going to guard the pawns so Leon plays this he goes here now Queen E5 who's going to guard that who's going to guard that the king yeah but guess what when this arrived here now I play AB now you can't take with the queen because after takes you would lose your Bishop so he does this Magnus trades you know why this game over game over computer doesn't even realize it game over Bishop is open pawns are loose Magnus is either going to win the entire Queen side or Checkmate his opponent Rook E8 he takes doesn't matter if you take Rook E6 that move looks nice but after here here here F6 white plays Queen G7 King d8 and takes or takes both win but taking the queen obviously wins faster so F6 and now Rook D4 wow Rook lift double up double up because Rook D7 is a threat too Queen F4 check Queen G4 and the King mercilessly hunted apparently here was more winning to play Bishop H6 which is kind of a scumbag cutting off the G file uh but uh Magnus is a human and he's not an engine and you know he's allowed to win the way he wants and he wins by taking a rook and getting his Rook to the seventh Rank and just going for those pawns so he completely cuts off the the pieces he's going to win all of this and black just resigns black could have played a few more moves for example Bishop C5 Queen A5 is a nice way for uh for black to create counterplay but Magnus wouldn't have blundered that I mean it's just it's it's just fascinating like the way he is able to win these games um with real openings and Goofy openings just stacking the knights and the bishop in the center before black has an opportunity to get settled Knight E4 he forces the king out and now it's just like slow methodical hitting the weaknesses hitting the weaknesses utilizing the diagonal knowing that after this trade black is going to surrender control of this D5 move because he's going to have to take away from the center like this and now D5 is very very important if ed5 you never trade the Queens here never never never never all right you never ever ever trade the Queens here but despite winning 11 games in a row at some point Leon won as well and watch as the young man from Croatia did get a win over Magnus car rson something that none of you ever have but having said that none of you have ever lost 18 games to Magnus so you're actually maybe even stronger than Leon that's a joke Magnus played the hillbilly attack this is a real this is a real yeah it's called the hillbilly attack some of you have probably been playing Bishop C4 against the caroan it's only the hillbilly attack if you play here uh if you take on D5 it's technically the hill attack but it's just stupid it's just it's it's just an exchange card so the hillbilly attack against the caroan gambits the E4 Pawn completely gambits it just like Magnus has been doing the entire time Queen H5 friends mate and black plays here Magnus plays Queen H4 and gets the following position now white is uh at very very very best case scenario white is equal and what white wants to do here is play Knight C3 and take on e4 and then he wants to play F3 take take Gambit style Gambit style excellent opening for beginners and intermediates slightly less good for advanced players but again Advanced chess players are like 1,800 2,000 they like spend a lot of money on opening courses they use chessable they use opening books and they think they're Above the Law like 2000s think they're really good 2000s don't know anything about Chess all right I'm an international master and compared to guys like this I know nothing about Chess okay so there are levels to this thing and even if you're 2,000 I guarantee if you study the hillbilly attack you're going to go beat people so actually a pretty venomous opening white just does this and I mean Black's Advantage is minus 3 point4 but good luck playing this position this is not an easy position to play White is going to go here long Castle put the Rooks on these files and just go for an attack Leon plays Knight bd7 and Magnus plays Bishop H6 I mean he he's already like does it feel like white is down a pawn not really I mean you're really going to tell me that black C and G pawns are making any sort of impression I would disagree right so Leon plays Queen A5 and now is you know Magnus uh can already begin attacking you know I I really like long Castle here but I guess for whatever reason Magnus didn't like Queen H5 I think Magnus didn't want a queen trade so instead of allowing that he plays Knight to G5 which is a very natural move and then Queen E5 check his idea was to block like this gambiing the pawn on B2 Bishop H6 Queen H6 black plays E6 blocking out White's light squared bishop and actually Magnus already has a good chance here with D4 but instead he gambits another Pawn so he's two pawns down but if he had played King D2 in this position apparently he's winning wi he has two pawns down but he's winning because he has one two three four attacking pieces maybe five and maybe six he's about to get the Rook I mean not right away but you know because he'd lose it but so he plays Rook D1 which is also fine and then his opponent accidentally allows the queen not accidentally maybe to to be blocked out and he tries to bring the queen back now Magnus plays Knight takes F7 which is apparently the move that was even winning in this position Knight F7 because after King F7 Queen H7 white can just play like G4 G5 and there's a line here G4 Queen A3 G5 allowing your Pawn to be captured and then here and then you double and play 94 and White's just completely winning which is which is wild uh so you may wonder how Magnus actually uh uh lost this game right because he sacrific look at this it's a draw he's a draw a draw by repetition now he's not going to make a draw because he's playing for Content so he takes on G6 still has good attacking chances the best thing for black to do here is to run his King away he brings the queen back which is also very natural but now Knight F4 Queen to G7 offering a queen trade white should just Retreat reinforce and come back with a big attack but Magnus Carlson is human and sometimes even the best human in the world makes a blunder and in this position Magnus thought he's going to take on E6 Rook E6 he's going to take check and then take the rook and then he would be potentially winning the end game so he did that but he forgot that after Rook E6 it's check so he hung his Queen his Queen just dies and he played a few more moves you know just in case cuz he is Magnus Carlson at the end of the day but uh it doesn't matter if you're Magnus Carlson or Carlos Magnuson he lost so he hung his Queen from an equal position cuz he thought he was winning an exchange hilarious now the position that he wanted was supposed to look like this at which point you know he he is playing this end game potentially for a win because he has more pawns instead of that he hung his queen that was the only game that Leon managed to win Magnus went on to win like seven more games and then he logged off ridiculous I uh I just just just very very very funny stuff and uh well Magnus defeats uh Leon uh lak from uh Croatia by the score of 181 and one they made one draw and Magnus is trying to be uh 3335 the highest ever Blitz rating achieved on ch.com is 3334 which was achieved like two days ago by Hikaru uh and Magnus is now chasing that as well it's the most incredible passive aggressive battle because they won't play each other it's like like it's like in tennis they score tour points but they will never play head-to-head they're just beating everybody else to get to the very top it's me it's hilarious uh hope you enjoyed just yet another piece of Magnus content of him just absolutely demolishing players from all over the world shout out to Leon for being a good sport playing on uh and not minding the result uh because I cannot lose this many games to a better player and like not try to break my computer so I'm a bad loser uh so that yeah you know anyway uh that's all I have for you today get out of here
