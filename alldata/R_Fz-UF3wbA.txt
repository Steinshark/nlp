hi I'm coffeezilla and I alongside some other researchers investigated safeman and we just published a 40-minute breakdown about why we think this billion dollar market cap company or coin was fraudulent and the story basically came down to the core promise of safe mode basically the money was supposed to be locked up Untouchable and it wasn't and I was finally ready to be done with this story when suddenly Thomas Smith who goes by the name Papa stepped forward to talk papa is the former CTO of safe mode and probably the second most important person in their history and he told me he was ready to take some questions now to be honest I respect the move it takes guts to take on hard questions and what follows is the highlights of our call together I think we should start with the moment that I confront Papa about the team basically committing fraud yeah and frankly I mean to be honest I I I'll just be I'll just be honest because we've been because I I feel like you know that I'm just trying to get to the truth here how is this not fraud uh which part the part where you know it starts and the everything's locked up guys don't worry the money's locked up don't worry we'll never touch it if we did we'd go to jail and get a loss and then subsequently everybody who owns the contract touches the lp and takes money how is that not fraud I think at first people like we were trying to do the auto locking and then when the organization started John leveraged to have it unlocked so there were a lot of there was a lot of Shifting at first but no the lp was taken from before John ever got on board it was taken from March 5th from the beginning money was being taken out of the lp I'm just I mean you definitely asked those questions but I don't have answers for you I'm not here I I I'll send you the transaction because I I don't I don't want to make a I never like to make statements where people no it's it's all right it's on the blockchain it's on the blockchain yeah I'll send uh I'll send you the transaction though just so you can check for yourself I don't want you to think that this is some kind of uh a thing there he is taking 36 trillion safe Moon out of the LP on March 5th how is this not fraught at this time they're saying it's Auto magically locking up for four years you never have to worry and then you guys end up with millions of dollars and the investors end up with negative 90 I mean you can understand the problem there well yeah I see a good problem for sure okay so papa says he sees the problem but what does that mean and how much did Papa get paid for this whole disaster that's a huge question that I've had from the beginning and so I asked him about it how much money did you profit from safeman the amount that I got was right around that like the 2 million Mark okay Papa made two million dollars according to him now I personally think it might be more than that but throughout our call that's the number he really stuck to he said he never had any secret wallets and any other wallets were just paying lawyers PR firms and other groups he only made two million dollars according to him and he said Kyle paid him a lot of that oh you got it from like Kyle yeah actually um he gave me a million dollars in safe moon at one point but the question is where did Kyle get that money from because if you listen to pop-up or anyone else in safe mode most of safe Moon's expenses come from Kyle's participation in the pre-sale and not the liquidity pool didn't you do you pay from the deployer wallet one trillion tokens to John uh the Gabe wallet um so the deployer wallet uh we we actually talked about this a lot in the in the early days kind of like buried beneath everything else today now but if you search for it I'm sure you'll find it uh the deployer wallet the balance that was in it was one of the early pre-sale um like so he he threw in like 300. into the launch of it who did I don't even think that he was the first buyer sleeping Dev ah yeah yeah so that was that was out of pocket for him whatever came out of that was out of pocket this has always been safe Moon's Story the money papa made Kyle made Ben Phillips made the tokens coroni got it all comes from the magical pre-sale tokens but this cannot be true because when you crunch the numbers most of Kyle's safe mode tokens didn't come from the pre-sale at all it didn't even come from the tokens that Kyle was constantly buying or selling to illustrate this I created a pie chart to show you the proportion of Kyle's safeman Holdings in red is the amount he took from the liquidity pool and blue is the pre-cell and in yellow is the net safe mode he purchased and then sold so as you can see a huge amount of Kyle's tokens came from the liquidity pool meaning that Thomas has some explaining to do Kyle specifically because I know you got paid and you paid coroni a bunch of money so when you actually look at Kyle's LP or his safe Moon amounts he couldn't have provided that had he not been taking money from the lp so you guys your payment was coming from liquidity that was supposed to be for the investors I mean I I really don't know anything about what was happening with the owner before I had it you didn't know he was taking money out no hmm it seems like the former CTO of a blockchain project is saying he didn't know what Kyle had done on the blockchain that he had basically been pulling money out of the project from the beginning now I'll be honest this seems hard to believe later pop admits it makes him uncomfortable the idea that maybe some of his funds came from a stolen liquidity pool that's what I was told at the time anyway you know you got it from the the pre-sale so I'm uncomfortable with that if it didn't come from the pre-sale right I mean that that's the whole that's the whole problem I agree with you I so I so I actually agree with you if safe Moon Dev had bought it in the pre-sell and he had decided to give you guys a payout and that's how you guys made your Millions we wouldn't be talking right the problem is that there was an Express thing that was the whole purpose of safe Moon the whole idea of safe moon was we're gonna go safely to the moon it's in the name how are we gonna go safely to the moon will these other D5 projects rug We're Not Gonna rug what's not gonna make us rug we're Auto magically locking the lp except no we aren't we're taking from the lp and that's actually how we're making our millions of dollars it's definitely obvious that that stance changed now here's where our conversation takes a big turn we've already discussed the whole I didn't realize this was from the liquidity pool argument and here comes their next argument basically safe Moon had pivoted and changed their story and they had told people that they were going to be taking money out of the liquidity pool but is that true it's definitely obvious that that stance changed I was locking you know myself but that but that stance changed April 21st first was your all-time high you guys were still it's like the day of store that I lost the 250. right right but what I'm saying is you guys are still changing the story at the time of your all-time high so even if it changed it's sort of like too little too late so many people are on this ride you know what I mean see that's the whole problem with this story even though safe Moon eventually told people that they would be taking money out of the liquidity pool this argument doesn't stand up because they've been taking the money out before they told anyone that's the critical issue March 5th is the first time they took money out and their official stance was still changing in April Papa didn't seem to see this as too big of a problem though we were pivoting often in those days so we started out on a WordPress page I definitely couldn't handle this stuff there was a lot of  on there that shouldn't have been there to begin with but even even your page up in up in April was LP There's Something About Auto locking LP or pink LP locked on pancake swap for four years blah blah blah you're talking about Auto locking LP people think you're out of locking it up I mean I was I was not making any like I never made any claims as to automatic or manually I was showing people I was telling people when I was doing it so we did it all together in this book right no I understand that maybe maybe you were like saying to people who asked but but the organization as a whole had made a certain representation right so the organization said okay I don't even think there was an organization fully made yet find a web a website somebody was saying that this thing's Auto locking this is the whole thing behind safe Moon I mean it's in the name right and y'all had it in your white paper about the Locking right the auto locking you did so that's the this is the whole problem that I'm struggling with is I just keep coming back to this feels like fraud this is fraud I mean how how could it not be you guys are millionaires your investors are down 90 and you guys are million millionaires directly from a representation that was false I mean we did tell people when we used it I didn't make any thoughts that we did change things a lot now honestly this is where things started to kind of go in circles and so I'll just leave it to you to decide how you want to feel about this we changed it over time idea now I want to move our conversation to talk about John caroni did you ever suspect coronia fraud yes holy wait what you did win I left right like when he started threatening to ruin the lives of the people that have been with me for 10 years uh when he the all that the fake articles about Jack the way that he treated everybody on the way out I mean now safe mooners are gonna say oh you got kicked out that's what they try to say about everyone they didn't say it about me but I I know firsthand that they were trying to prepare a um a statement and then their um PR firm talk him down wow papa says he suspected coronia fraud based on how he treated his fellow employees and said he routinely threatened his co-workers I continued to dig about this and I also tried to understand more about safe Moon's true Origins specifically coroni's Origins so is it true that coroni lived in a van or like trailer before uh safeman yes where did that come from but it wasn't really it it was um for him it was it was a bougie trailer we did it purposefully well I'm just saying it's not like he wasn't Rich before safeman no okay I'm just wondering all right now I want to show you something what I'm about to show Papa next are the multiple million dollar payments to John caroni from bitmart because the idea is after establishing coroni was living in a trailer around the time that he stumbled into safe Moon suddenly he's being paid millions of dollars like how Thomas seemed equally perplexed Jesus Christ what is that that's uh that's just that's just a couple of several million dollar payments to coroni that's six million dollars right there when was that was that was in June last year yep yeah see I knew a bunch of this was happening but I didn't know it was going to him so you knew somebody was profiting from like well my understanding was that it was our safe right this was just weird how could Papa not have known caroni's wallet was doing all of this because to be to begin with he was one of the people who told me that it was coroni's wallet before our call he told me he knew it was caroni's wallet immediately based on the last four digits of the wallet 6 Abe he said in a DM hey yo that 6abe is John and then later told me this how'd you also know that oh no as soon as I someone else pasted it to me and as soon as I saw a 6abe I knew exactly what wallet it wasn't instantly yeah so if you hear I think forever ago there were a few hints to it back at the amas and other you know like Discord discussions where he'd talk about Gabe and people thought it was a person but it's really just an address oh and it's so like kind of like you know the lead speak Gabe yeah uh smart um yeah I know not very smart actually uh now after telling me this wallet was under John's control Papa would later tell me he remembered this as a corporate account it's supposed to be a safe moon or a tanno account he then later clarified in DMS quote that wallet is a Tano Wallet not a safe Moon wallet confirmed now as a reminder Tano is a company John owned and controlled here's the Articles of Incorporation he's the number one member and most importantly he's not putting the money back in the lp like he's supposed to to be honest Papa's surprised about all this stuff in coroni's wallet is just hard to believe and maybe he was just playing thumb I don't know his explanation for a lot was the fact that basically John ran the show and he was basically just an employee it's not like any of those decisions where even remotely run so if misrepresentations dude I get marching orders you know is that your basketball your boss that's asking you every five minutes if they're tracking what you're saying or with your tracking with this you know what I mean like that so you felt like you were just like an employee well yeah I was at Tano employee the whole time even though you were the sea turtles they were this weren't you the CTO I was never a safe and despite having a title or whatever it's through the management contractor Hannah which was a joke yeah that's another mess that I need to deal with probably the job and this idea was a recurring theme Papa told me that basically everything he did with the safe Moon contract wasn't his idea it was John's this includes their bitmart deal and how they use the liquidity pool Papa told me that part of the way they were making money with bitmart was a money market account he told me they sold safe moon to bitmart in exchange for money I asked them where they got that safer what does that mean they bought it OTC for over the counter from safer but yeah how did how did safe moon have that safe moon to sell where did they get that from right so the the migration the wet so when Pancakes there were a ton of migrations um the V1 to V2 pancake swap so it's it's V1 safe Moon V1 PCS and the migration to V2 PCS so when that happened we had to move the liquidity over and we had to find kind of weird ways we had to pull liquidity in order to move it over to V2 and in doing so that there was a lot of Satan that came out that wasn't put in V2 yeah why wasn't it put in V2 it just um it was it was it was given to or well not given but John John sold it to the uh World Tech I guess you could I don't even know how to classify what you would say this transaction is but so because the exchanges need to obtain the safe Moon they got it from that that pool and the safe moon was intended to be sent to the holders anyway so we figured you know the liquidity is still the liquidity now I'll be honest the liquidity is still the liquidity is a pretty weird answer basically they're saying those millions of dollars we made oh it's all just part of the liquidity it's all legit and I had to ask Thomas about this where he thought this money that was being generated came from so I'm like not satisfied by this like like the exchange deal makes no sense to me I don't understand why like why millions of dollars or 55 million needs to go to bitmart for exchange deals this makes no sense to me and what John was saying apparently is he told someone with the bitmart deal they were about to be put into a new tax bracket right he said what he said we're about to be put into a new tax bracket why would he say that if he wasn't going to personally profit from it right so here's my so here's my question like okay explain this to me because obviously we both know money can't come from nowhere so let's say if you're just migrating the funds from V2 V1 to V2 no money is generated for safe men if you migrate V1 to V2 but you do it in that weird way where you put a buy order and you end up with millions of dollars of safe mode and then you sell that safe moon to an exchange all of a sudden money has been created for safemen and you're telling me that has no price impact for the bot for the for the people of safeman how's that possible the price I guess the the value impact will come from volatility but only on the V1 V2 PCS the money has come from somewhere it didn't come from nowhere right right yeah how can that be how can how could safe moon be generating free money right and the same argument could be made about an unlocked LP in John's hands so the reason why he wants it unlocked is so that he can use it right so he doesn't have to go through this process likely so that's a lot easier than just you know so these other exchanges were so willing to do this deal because saving comes with a lot of Orwell they've come with a lot of volume yeah they're going to get a ton in fees right so I'm still I'm so so again you can use it for something other than what he should have been using it for and that should be called out so like so here's what I'm seeing like safe moon is making millions the exchanges are making millions yeah who's losing Millions right the people who take the fees the investors that's where all the money came from yeah there it is folks money doesn't come from nowhere if you can take anything from this video If safe Moon suddenly is making millions it has to come from somewhere and if it's from the lp that's a problem because again that was supposed to be locked up now I also talked to Papa about the fees bitmarch stated they were taking to give back to the development team to be placed in the lp and I wanted to know were they doing that so the second part of this is that I got this from their website so they say that and I understand maybe they weren't perfect about this but they say they charge trading fees and that five percent will be directly redistributed okay we know that that's Reflections and then it says five percent will be returned to the developers to be added back to the liquidity pool for safe Moon totals yeah that's something that happened after I was that's the V2 thing that I left before V1 was discontinued um no guys this is this is from April 2nd 2021. so this is this should be um this should be last year okay so that's I mean that's not really how we did it though up until V2 when Swap and liquify was turned off so we we only ever manually transferred LP for when that like that if the lp contracts needed to be upgraded but still there's like there's a ton of locked liquidity on V1 still right that's gonna be there for like four years there's we've discovered a few ways that can be withdrawn still um they're obviously people have found bugs in the if you want mp2 contracts V2 contracts can be updated it's it's a proxy so you can change whatever's behind the proxy um the trick is maintaining the balance our balances so you said you guys really didn't do it that way you meet do you mean by that you weren't paid by bitmart or you didn't put the whatever you were paid by bitmart back into the lp oh no I mean like bitmark didn't pay safe moon to list with bitmark no no I understand that but they say they are going to give you guys tokens so they're saying basically look every every time you trade on bitmart we're taking 10 of it five percent we're giving back to the bitmart holders and five percent were giving back to Safe moon to put into the lp um yeah so all of the on each of the centralized exchanges the way that it's supposed to work if tokenomics are you know quote unquote enabled each it simulates the the V1 process where 10 fee uh and then uh half of it goes to the market making and then half the other half goes to the um the holders um and obviously there were problems with that along the way because it wasn't automated but because of that process rather than them just collecting it and doing it themselves they opted all of them opted to purchase it from sequin because it was easier for them they didn't have to upgrade their systems and deal with devs and all this other stuff but where did that other five percent go is what I'm saying so you're saying like my theory I've honestly I have no idea what happened inside the market making accounts well that's not a very good answer okay so papa says he doesn't know what happened inside the market making accounts but he says he doesn't think they were putting it into the lp again a massive problem as I said I believe this is a fraud no matter how you slice it because of the simple premise that they said the funds were locked up they weren't and they used a bunch of it now they did pivot The Stance later but again we've addressed this they had been taking money well before that and the company had reached values of like billions of dollars by the time they had disclosed it as for the specifics of what happened with things like bit payments to Kyle a lot of those questions remain unanswered I think the only person who can truly tell us is John caroni and like I've said I've reached out for over a month and he has yet to respond meanwhile the person who is talking I'm grateful to him but I find his answers less than satisfied what do you think should be done about this well I think the first thing that happens is we go to court but here's but here's what I'm saying here's what I'm saying do you think it's right for you to have two million dollars for Kyle to have however much he has for John to have millions of dollars all you guys to walk away Millionaires and all your investors a lot of them are down 90 percent do you think that's fair well I know I know you're frustrated and you've got a lot of really good points from my perspective Patricia probably be only answering on for that part is I perform a service for money I'm a Dev I've always been a Dev this is what I do I've been doing it for a long time um so if I work out a deal with the org that's controlling me to get paid for something I'm providing real value on my end well I guess that's their last defense I deserve the money because I worked for it I personally don't find that too credible but I want to know what you think in the comments below and that's basically it pump the stock thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next one
