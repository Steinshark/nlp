[Music] the center of [Music] helenismo is a vibrant helenic Cultural Center for not only us here in the community but for all over the world [Music] to preserve the past but also to perpetuate the future [Music] good evening as our lovely director of this wonderful institution uh said previously I am Father Patrick oror the dean of students here at helenic College Holy Cross um but about 12 years ago almost 13 now I was Scott Patrick oror a wayward college graduate who had just completed a postgraduate Fellowship in in Philadelphia and who had just moved for a summer to Charleston South Carolina to live and work with Master Craftsman and Artisan Andrew Gould um Andrew if you're unaware Andrew designs Orthodox Churches he designs everything that goes inside of a church from iconostasis to vestments to Windows um but I didn't go there to work on architecture natural things alone one of the things that Andrew asked me to help with was my most recent uh professional Endeavor which was journalism he asked me to come and help establish the Orthodox Arts journal and he told me that it would be a threers team that would start this uh Andrew myself and some guy up in Canada named Jonathan um Jonathan pjo is how I used to say it before I learned better and so 12 almost 13 years ago I met Jonathan through the phone we've had many conversations we've worked on a few different projects and I've even helped him with some of the things that he's done recently um for those of you who are unaware of Jonathan's full trajectory he was very much what you would call a starving artist um as a an icon Carver and the Orthodox Arts Journal was his first foray into expressing uh his thoughts and his interpretations of symbolism within the confines of ecclesiastical art primarily in iconography and for about 5 years Jonathan did that and was well received um he went from being Jonathan pjo a guy in Canada that I talked to on the phone to somebody whose thoughts and insights I deeply valued and took into to myself and started to look at the world through the lenses that he was giving myself and others he took that as a springboard to create what now everyone knows as the symbolic World um a series that started off um primarily online which has now grown into an IRL presence in real life um with a a recent and very successful uh symbolic World Conference Jonathan has a wonderful way of expressing these truths that symbolism helps us digest and understand from within the church but now outward into the world and in that way I think he is a wonderful Paradigm for all of us uh to learn to internalize and then to share outside of the confines of our own ecclesiastical environment so I hope and I pray that tonight through his wisdom and his words each of us may take in some of these insights and start to form our vision of the icons of Holy Week so that we can encounter them through their symbolism being transformed by them then we can share those truths in symbols with the rest of the world with no further Ado it is my joy and my honor to introduce to you a friend that I have now made after 12 years in real life Mr Jonathan [Applause] Pou so it is uh it's a great joy to be here for several years now I've wanted to come and visit Holy Cross at helenic college and so um this was a great opportunity to come I want to thank uh especially Dr Timothy ptiza who I've become friends with over the past few years whose thought is I feel very very close to mine uh expressing the Deep truth that we find in the in our tradition uh in a manner that can also help to to heal the world you know through Beauty and through these these patterns of being and so you know I on my YouTube channel I talk about all kinds of things but obviously what I really love to talk about is icons and the the powerful symbolism that we find in them that's where my root is and so you know if I'm going to speak at a at an orthodox College obviously I'm going to talk about icons and so as we have Holy Week coming towards us very soon I thought it would be wonderful to go through the icons that we that we see during Holy Week as they follow the story of The Passion of course but also that I believe that the the succession of the icons and we find in those particular icons they reveal to us uh a mystery about about the the the passion about the Incarnation itself one that we also find in the hnology as well and it's something of the deep Paradox of the Incarnation the Deep Paradox of Christ you know how he is both the the God man but also is the one who ends up horribly crucified on the cross and so in the icons we kind of see that we see these extremes being put up against each other and so we're going to go through some of the icons and look at the symbolism that is shown there um and so we're going to turn it on there you go all right and so we're going to start with Palm Sunday the entry into Jerusalem you know and here we really see there are different aspects of the way we represent Christ you know you know the iconography of Christ is to represent him as an emperor really to represent him as this glorious character the way that Christ is dressed in our icons he's dressed as a like a Roman Senator or or you know a Roman nobleman Jesus was probably not dressed that way in first century Galilee you know with the the the clav the sign of nobility on his cloth but it was in some ways as Christian art started to develop it was a way to signify that he was the king he was the the King of Kings and the Lord of lords and so in icons like the entry into Jerusalem this is what we're seeing the image of the of the entry into Jerusalem is based on the images of the sorry let me get this water the images of the uh triumphal entry of Emperors so if when you look at the images of the of the triumphal entry of different Emperors into to Rome after their Conquest this is the pattern that they would have you would see him on a horse coming in and the people greeting him uh as he entered into the city of course it's not a stretch because that is how also how it's described in the gospels because that is what was happening the people were even if in a very kind of tenuous way it seems that they were welcoming their King and they were treating him as a king and as an Emperor as he was is entering into the city this image of the of the entry into Jerusalem is really one of the oldest images as soon as Christian art starts to flourish we already have the type appear right away so this is a 4th Century image of the entry to Jerusalem on the sarcophagus of Junius bassis and we see that almost all the elements that we still have today in our icon of the entry Jerusalem is there you have Christ coming in sitting on a donkey you have someone climbing up in a tree that is going to cut out cut down the branches then you also have a child putting his vestment under the the feet of the of the donkey so this is what we're seeing here Christ is coming to the city he is the Glorious Emperor and what what's interesting about this as well is that Christ is sitting on a donkey now why is he on a donkey and not on a horse um there are different interpretations but the one that I find the most interesting is actually the one that is parallel to the interpretation that is still current among Jews today uh it's the one that origin you know kind of teases out as he was in contact with rabbis of his time which is that the Messiah sitting on a donkey is he's sitting on an impure animal and what that means is that he's actually sitting on the nation of the Gentiles like he's ruling the Gentiles he's ruling the the impure folks the people that aren't us and that ruling them he is now coming having conquered them you know into Jerusalem and this is the interpretation that uh origin takes and it's one of the interpretation that is kept in the church fathers after him what's fascinating about it is already in this image and already in the way that Christ is writing the foreign Nations into Jerusalem there's already the Paradox of what it is that Christ is going to do and what it is that Christ is going to be because you know you often hear you know the more cynical uh more cynical Bible scholars who say everybody was expecting a king that would deliver that would deliver the Jews and what ended up happening was that he was killed and therefore the promise wasn't fulfilled right that's what they were expecting but the truth is that Jesus did conquer Rome I mean it took 300 years but he did conquer Rome and he did it in a manner that was very different from how people usually conquer cities he did it from the inside through a type of transformation which was not a military conquest but was a deep inner transformation that was related to what it is that Christ is going to show all during passion week but what we do see in the image of course is this powerful image of the king that is coming to into the City and is being received by the people uh celebrating him as the [Music] king now in my opinion one of the best ways to interpret icons is to interpret them together is not to isolate the icons and interpret them separately but to interpret them as they relate to each other and in the lurgical cycle what comes after the entry into Jerusalem is the bridegroom matens and for the the service of the bridegroom matens we bring out this icon which is the icon of the we call the icon of the bridegroom but it's it's based on a on several other other icons we'll go through them a little but now all of a sudden with you see is this humiliated beaten tortured man and so the the contrast is very strong between the emperor that comes into the City and then suddenly right away you know and in some traditions this icon will be brought out on the Sunday on Palm Sunday and will be put into the church right after the the the services that celebrate the that celebrate Palm Sunday and so you have this contrast which is here's the emperor and then here is this beaten tortured man now again in this icon although it's like the opposite you could say of the entry to Jerusalem just like in the entry in the entry of Jerusalem there's this strange Paradox about how it is that this king is going to end up ruling now again you see the same he's obviously not just a tortured man but he is a king right he is wearing a crown he is holding a scepter he is dressed in the purple and so he is this King that has come into Jerusalem to rule and so we see in this image the Deep irony that that is going to happen to P in passion week the con these clashes of meaning that are are going to be brought together that we discover in our hypography you know the the the Opposites coming together is what we're seeing um and this this image it's interesting because this image is a is a rather late image and there are even iconographers today that refuse to Painted because they say that it's a western image it's based on the on the E homo uh image that was developed in the west you know where you see you know Christ is taken out and say here is the man uh but it is nonetheless even though it's a late image it is based on uh on very early types uh which we call the king of glory which are similar but so show Christ going down into the tomb and having the elements of the crucifixion with him and so they wouldn't have been related at the outset with bridegroom matens but the elements of the of the bridegroom icon are there and so what's fascinating about the about the bridegroom icon as well is that you know when you look at bridegroom matens there's an eschatological Motif right it's this it's the the the parable of the the 10 virgins that you know that have to have their the oil in their lamps and they have to be ready for the coming of the king and there's this idea right of this this final moment there's this eschatological reality about it but the icon that we use to celebrated is this image here is your bridegroom right here is your king um and the Deep irony is present and we'll see that go through all the icons of Holy Week and that's the way that I want you to start to think about what happens during the passion and what we see in the images of the of the icons of Holy Week the next icon that we usually encounter in Holy Week is the washing of the feet um again in this image we have this strange moment where the king right the same King that came into Jerusalem is now humiliating himself and making him the servant of his disciples and we see this Paradox again represented in the image I love and oh by the way some of these are my carvings I'm I'm not point I'm not good at pointing them out every time you see a carving it's one of mine just I thought you could see some of the things that I that I that I do um and so here you in the in the story of course of the washing of the feet and in the image of the washing of the feet you really have you're playing with this tension and it's a tension that's hard to even in the decisions of the iconographer it's difficult to know sometimes even how to do it so Christ removes His Garment and then washes the feet of the disciple but in most of the traditions of this image we also try to find some physical way to show that Christ is standing and so in most of the images he's standing and they they they stack the disciples up or they do they find some way to do it so that you know we don't we don't know how to deal with this problem of you know which one is it you know is he the king is he the humiliated one how do we do this because you know he is the Lord of Lord he's the king of kings he's the son of God he's all these things but now he's washing the feet how do we signify that in the image without betraying something without you know without going too far in one in one way or the other and so you see in most of the images of the of the washing of the feet Christ is standing disciples are sitting and he is washing their feet though he's not completely prostrating himself before the disciples um and then you see of course in in St Peter's face that a wonderful expression of dismay where he is completely dismayed at what is happening you know he cannot understand what is going on and again this is this is ultimately is the mystery of of Holy Week I think that in this image we have the entire mystery of Christian hierarchy like how does Christian Authority function because we have this problem and we're going to we're going to see it all through the icons like we we have this problem when we think of Christ when we think of authority how do we deal deal with it we have on the one hand the image of Christ as the one who is the king of kings and is this this Regal figure but also Christ who you know goes to the marginalized who who who helps the the who who helps the poor who heals the sick who does who's constantly going to the lost sheep so how do we how do we reconcile this in the image and I think in this particular image we have a powerful vision of Christian hierarchy which is that Christ tells his disciples that he is going to wash their feet and then the disciples don't say well it's about time right it's like you know it's like we were waiting for this you know finally he comes down from his from his high horse no the disciples are dismayed and are saying no no no like you can't wash our feet you know we we should be washing your feet that's that's how it's supposed to be and then Christ then does the most wonderful thing ever which is that he uses his authority to then serve them he says no I'm the boss I decide now shut up and let me wash your feet right and so I think that that is one of the most powerful images of what it what Authority in the Christian vision is which is on the one hand the the those that are our leaders you know there they in love want to serve us but we as those who see our leaders we also you know want to serve them as well and if we have that if we can keep that deal going then things go well if they move too far in One Direction or the other then things start to to go off track and you see that in in a family it's like my children have to submit to me but you know I'm supposed to love my children if I if I if my if I don't love my children at some point it's difficult to blame them from not wanting to listen to me you know so that balance is a very power and it's an image I think of everything that happens in in the icons of of Holy Week and in Holy Week in general and so I want to give you just take a little detour and tell you about you know my own so I when I made this image I because I was thinking about this problem and so I did decide to make Christ kneeling and there are some precedents for it you know you can you know when you're you're making icons if you're going to do something a little different you really have to shake you have to be a little I in my for me at least you have to be uh tentative and and nervous about it but I I really felt like I wanted to show Christ's kneeling as he washed his feet we have examples in early early renaissance images of this so this is an image by duio where you see Christ kneeling as he's Wasing the feet um and then one of the things for example that I that I wanted to do which I hadn't which I've seen in other images was of course to have Judas walking away as Christ is washing everybody's feet and to kind of show them inside profile which is a which is one of the tropes that we see in uh in in icons um and so then we the next image we have is an image of the last supper now again we move in these extremes which is on the one hand you have Christ who humbles himself who who who who comes down and serves his disciple and becomes the servant of all and then again he becomes now again the head of the table he becomes the high priest he becomes the one who's running the show and he's offering the meal to his disciples and he's telling them what's going to happen you know he's he's telling even St Peter to take a sword he's he is acting as the leader again and so you see right in the even in the same event right in the same evening when they're in the upper room that this this deep these deep this deep Paradox about of Holy Week is playing itself out in the story and is then also playing playing itself out in the images this image uh that I carved it's one of my very first commissions I think it's like in 2012 that I carved this this icon and so I I was it was very very early so I made it a strict copy of a famous icon from vet toed that I loved that I've Loved for you know I Lov for a decade before that I finally was able to carve it and I and I was very very grateful this year to have the chance to see the the Fresco at vatopedi you know just kind of stood there in front of it for way too long yeah the monks they not used to people just looking at the icon some point it it become a little nervous like what is he he just standing there looking at the icon um but yeah but uh but for me it was a great joy to see it and in this in in this particular Fresco and in some ways it was is one of those images that was the inspiration for my uh washing of the feet icon because you can see that the way that I represented Judas in this icon is almost the same as the way that I represented him in the icon of the Wasing of the feet with a with a a certain look with curly hair and then also um from on the side profile all right and of course from the holy supper then we come to the icon of the crucifixion now the the image of the crucifixion uh the entire mystery of this contradiction or this Clash of extremes is in its fullest fullest representation you know and we have to understand that it took quite a while for Christians to be willing to represent the crucifixion openly you know we do have early images of Christ on the cross from the fifth century usually on there's an image on on the door of Santa Sabina very schematic and there's also an ivory we have an ivory box from the fifth century but it's it's not very and they're struggling again with the problem how do we do this the first image is so here's a here's a six Century image of the crucifixion from the rebula gospel um you know how do we represent this and people are struggling with reason to know how to represent this deep mystery that is happening so the early earliest representations of Christ what they will do is they will show him on the cross with his eyes open and wearing a Regal vestment wearing a kind of Royal vestment to cover his nakedness um and you can you can kind of understand why they're doing that because how do we so what do we just represent him naked is that what we're supposed to do what how do we deal with this with this problem of the of the Cross because it is you know we're so used to seeing crosses we're so used to seeing crucifixes that we forget how scandalous this image is it is so scandalous ultimately what would happen there are stories of Western Christians coming to Constantinople in I think like 10th or 11th century and witnessing some of the first images where Christ is shown with his eyes closed on the cross and slumped on the cross and being scandalized right freaking out how is it that they're doing this ultimately that image would end up being the image that we represent but we never show people's eyes closed in icons we don't do that because it means they're dead like we're showing someone who's dead on the cross and that has that's a very deep thing like anyways that the but on the cross and in the image of the Cross we really have all of this coming together which is that Christ on in this image brings together all the stories of the Old Testament you know all of these extremes into one he is the king it says so on his on the on the board above his head that he is the king he is lifted up you know he's lifted up for all to see both in glory and in shame his he is returning into the garden and we know that he's returning into the garden because even in the icon will represent him like I did for example in in in my version where you see the two thieves you see the good thief and the bad thief and so you see Christ on the tree Discerning good and evil right that's what he's doing and his nakedness is both the nakedness of the garden but also the nakedness of Shame which comes after the fall it's like it's a weird clash of the all the images together he kind of brings it together in one in one moment and of course you know we could have there are all these things that we could show in a crucifixion but we have chosen mostly to show the mother of God and St John at his side and why like why are we doing that and there are probably plenty of reasons but one one of the reason is that this is the beginning of the church right the church is being born in the moment that Christ is closing his eyes and so the world you know St Maximus goes way further than I Dare You St Maximus says Christ is creating the world on the cross you know and say like it's the when when they pierced his side and the water and the blood came out it is the water of the Garden of Eden that is Flowing from his side it is Eve that is bursting from his side it is all these images of of the beginning that is happening in the end you know when Christ says I'm the alpha the Omega he wasn't joking like it really comes together in this particular image where you see Christ elevated and humiliated all at once you know spreading his hands out in order to to gather the entire world into himself as he is emptying himself out at the same time and we always show uh we most of the time when we show the crucifixion we'll show the the Sun and the Moon in the image in mind is it there in the Mosaic no it's not but in mind you'll see the Sun and the Moon in the rebula gospel one you see it as well if you look at the top of the image you'll see the the Sun and the Moon um and you know and you can see that the Christ early Christians knew that this was a a cosmic event that this was the center of the world right that the that the the the Cross of Christ is the mountain it is the pillar it is the right it is the con it is the pillar that God was in in Exodus all of these images of anything that connects Heaven and Earth is ultimately brought together in the image of the Cross um and we show that in the icon because what we show is the you know we we show the the Sun and the Moon above with the Angels Above you know we when you see Angels Above you always have to remember we're so used to these images right so we have we have the Angels Above and then below we have the skull of Adam right that is down below but you could see that as as the skull of Adam of course but you could just see it is death as death itself death is down below and above you have the Angels but these are the you know the same angels that sang at his birth they're the patterns of of the The Music of the Spheres the patterns of the heavens everything that is above is there witnessing this Cosmic event which connects that world with this world below of death and is just crashing them together in one image [Music] but this image is mostly of course an image of a man uh being tortured on a cross and so what will happen I think inevitably is that we will ultimately lead the this will lead to the image of the anastasis which which we'll see and those two have to be kind of held together in attention you know we'll look at them when we get there now these images now the images of The Descent of the Cross are in some ways even more scandalous than the cross itself in terms of what is going on here you know here here is the god man being taken down the limp body you know and ultimately this image I think is probably one of the most difficult ones once again we never show people horizontal in icons right because when we show people horizontal in icons it means that they're dead and we don't we usually don't show dead people in icons I know that sounds weird but we usually show icons have an eschatological quality we tend to show people alive in icons you know because we represent their being and so these images are very very paradoxal and mysterious to show Christ you know lying down on on the on the tomb or lying down on the stone is to is to really show The Mystery of of the Incarnation and ultimately what is what it's coming I think the only other image that we have that's similar to this is the dorm mission where we have you know the mother of God lying down I'm trying to I'm probably going to find more as my scan in my mind but we very rarely show people really just dead in icons um and of course people have pointed out that this the image sadly I didn't bring one but that this image of Christ lying down you know on the stone as he's being wrapped and being put into the tomb is parallel to the image of the Nativity where Christ is also wrapped you know already in the cave you know as a as a prophecy or a promise of what the Incarnation is about um and of course as we know this image is going to be used during the during the the the Pascal during the the the funeral procession where we have this icon which is stitched on a on a piece of cloth and then we carry it as we carry the body those I mean most people here are probably Orthodox and you know that um but that this ends up being this the very Body of Christ that is that is cared for that we take that we venerate that we bring out into the into the church to be venerated um and so it has a lurgical function in itself it's not just an icon that we see on the wall like a fresco or a painting but it is a becomes the very object is part of the Liturgy it becomes the a standin for the very Body of Christ that we carry out and we bring out in order to be buried and to be to be venerated and this leads of course to the image of the anastasias now I think again this image of the of the anastasis shows us the same problem or the same problem of passion weak which is we show Christ on the cross and then we show that there is death below often we'll show you can see the blood of Christ that is Flowing down onto the skull of Adam below right and so what that's signifying is that what you're seeing on the outside here what's secretly happening is this which is what's visibly happening on the outside is Christ being humiliated being subject to death but that secretly he is now again the great conqueror he is now the Emperor he's now the king and he is coming down into death as a as a hero as a conqueror as the emperor that's coming into his City in order to gather all of his and to take them out of death and so you have this contrast again of on the one hand the Deep humiliation but on the other hand the Conquering that is happening simultaneously and we also have to remember that on the cross what you see with the blood dripping on the skull of of Adam is Christ going down into death to get Adam that's what's happening on the cross already and so we we separated of course we have the icon of the descendant of Hades and we have the crucifixion but those two are happening simultaneously right this is what is happening on the cross the the cross brings it all together and now we separate it again but here we really have if you look at the image of Christ he is he is a superhero in this image you know if you if you kind of you see him like with the often like the cape floating if you try to imagine the scene the way it's represented you know he's like flying into to death and grabbing people and like you know like just pulling them out of Hades you know and breaking the door open and all of this really dramatic imagery of the Conqueror of death uh coming in coming into to to Hades to to get his um but that is ultimately all the images are playing between these two realities and how one ultimately is the reason for the other and and I this is what I mean when I say that it's it's captured to some extent in the washing of the feet uh it's captured to some extent in the image of the crown of thorns you know the image of the crown of thorns is is also one to me one of the most mysterious images in the Bible because the crown the the Thorns are a consequence of the fall right so when Adam and Eve sin God says the world the Earth will produce Thorns so they're a consequence of death they are in some ways a reaction to death think about it like what Thorns are they're basically a defense mechanism they're they're the plants protecting themselves from a dangerous world and they're also the opposite of a like a mountain or a point there many many there a breakdown of points where instead of having one one point you've got all these different points that are going in all kinds of Direction there really are an image of of fragmentation of violence and all of that but then Christ takes that and then makes it into his crown you know um and it truly is a crown right it is a crown of of Glory so you see that you see this contradiction hinted at and I think that really uh that this is I mean it really is the mystery of what Christianity offers and it's not um when you when you see it you know once Christ offered that to the world it's understandable that it's a complete Scandal it's a complete Scandal to present this it's like okay so this guy who's who's tortured and mocked this deep irony where we pretend he's the king all of these the this strange uh this strange giving up of himself and and then he's the king like how does that work but when you look at the image of the washing of feet you can see that that's actually how reality Works Christ is actually exposing how the world functions he's it's not like it's not just this arbitrary thing that we have to believe in in in you know just to whatever to be saved but he is sh he's revealing to the world how creation functions which is that the in order for someone to rule they necessar in order for anything to rule in order for it to rule properly it necessarily has to empty itself there's no other way for that to happen and Christ is doing the opposite of what obviously what Adam and Eve did in the garden which is instead of saying mine instead of saying I own this I'm in charge I'm the one you know I've got Divinity I can take it he did the very opposite although he was God he emptied himself and he he emptied out his his presence into the world and ultimately that's why he can be king and it's in some ways the only legitimate King is the one that does that or else we have the problem that we have all the time which is corruption which is tyrany which is all of these things we have to deal with this as humans all the time but we know even in our own tradition we know that the bash Bishops are always the ones that didn't want to be Bishop you know you know that the story of the monk that gets dragged out of the desert you know like there we have so many of those those stories in in in the in our tradition and we know that that's actually how how the world Works um and what's amazing is in the juxtaposition of the icons of Holy Week you seem to have this play between the two which is on the one hand the Glorious King and on the on the other hand the one who empties himself who humiliates himself who who descends who becomes the smallest and those are played against each other all during Holy Week to try to help you see the mystery of what is happening um which is that that is actually how reality function so of course the last image is of Holy Week is the Mir bearing image and again you know you have these you have these images of the one of the things that I love about this this image is how how humble it is you know we actually don't have a tradition of a resurrection icon in Orthodoxy everybody kind of knows that we have later images like 19 Century images but we don't actually have an A a tradition of a resurrection icon you know and and it's very fascinating because it I think it again plays with this this mystery of that which is this glorious aspect which is hidden in the humble which is hidden in the small which is hidden in something which at the outset looks like the very opposite of what it is and I think that it is captured in our in our icon of the Resurrection which is our icon of the Resurrection isn't you know we could our icon of the Resurrection could have been the icon of Mary Magdalene for example seeing Christ in the garden although that icon kind of exists it's not the one that's most liturgically used this is the one that we celebrate with the the Sunday of the M bearing uh women and it's like that's it that's the image there's a weird anticlimactic aspect to it but I think that that anticlimactic uh aspect is part of again the mystery of what the Incarnation is doing and that our image of the Resurrection is an image of the empty tomb right is is an image of Christ no longer in the Tomb and if you think about you know what we were shown before you know this image right and this and this image we can understand how this image of the empty tomb is this this this little sigh of relief in the end this little like and the fact that it's the women also that are there you know it it also has to do I do believe it has to do with something about the secret of the Resurrection because even in scripture the resurrection isn't described you know it doesn't say he was lying in the Tomb and then then he got up and he he left no it's always described from the outside and it's described in ways that is even contradictory right you know it's like the disciples don't recognize them and then you know they don't recognize him on the road they don't recognize him there's this way in which they were trying to diffuse even the Resurrection itself which is the central our Central teaching but there's something in the gospel that is wanted to say hey don't think you've got this like don't think you master this like you don't you don't control this this is something that is that that you have to approach with the type of reverence and hesitation and almost fear that you see in the women in the icon of the my bearing the M bearing women um so what I want to propose to you is that in some ways these two aspects that I mentioned to you they are the key to understanding much of of our iconographic tradition which is on the one hand we have images in our iconographic Canon which are images that represent Christ as the Glorious one that Christ as the the the the light that is shining that everybody is seeing we can think of the Transfiguration we can think of the icon of of baptism theophany there are many images like that that represent this kind of Glorious aspect of Christ but we also have other images that seem to represent the making small or the going in and and in that we have of course the icon of the Nativity we have we have the actually the icon of the of theophany has both a bit of both right because he's naked in the water so there's something about that that is also this this kind of mystery um but you can understand these two extremes of Christ which is both Christ in the Dome of the church as the great judge the one who comes in the end and you know rules over all of reality but then at the same time he is the innocent victim who was destroyed by Authority you know and that's the Paradox and that's in some ways why he can be the great king and the great judge is because he went through all the Injustice of what Authority is because we you know in in we have this problem right now in um in North America in the world in as well and even in Christianity is that we have our own we have our Jesus a lot of people have their Jesus and many people like the the victim Jesus you know it's like the the the Jesus who is an unjust victim of a tyrannical and corrupt system and the Jesus who is friends with the prostitutes friends with the the marginal people you know and that is definitely Jesus and there's some people who like the other Jesus who like the you know he's the logos he's the Divine logos he decides what's true he decides what's real he rules over all reality all knee all knees will bow everyone will confess that he is the Lord and so you have these this tension but the reality is that they're they're the same and if with with only one you don't get the full image of Christ and with only the other you do not get the full image of Christ and if you don't have them together uh then you have perversions of Christianity ultimately on one side or the other and so we have this powerful testimony of of of of Christ and even the eschatological Christ it's in in the image of the Heavenly Jerusalem it's described that the son of man is ruling over the city and there's this description of the son of man as the one sitting on the throne you know and is ruling over all of reality but also he is also paired you know with the lamb that was sacrificed before the foundation of the world and those two are together they are the they're the same person and we need to kind of we need to keep them together because that is that is the testimony that Christianity uh offers that is the testimony that that that we have for the world and it is the only manner that we as Christians can find each other because [Music] even we have to be able to see in others if if one of us is the Christian that likes the The King The King Jesus we have to know that the the Christian that likes the victim Jesus he's right and the other way the other way as well and if able if we able to do that I do believe that we will find in the church a great solution to many of the problems that we're facing today so thank you for your [Applause] time thank you so much Jonathan now this portion of the program is going to be a Q&A with Jonathan and Dr Timothy batitas who we mentioned earlier he's the dean of helenic college and a professor of Ethics also the author of the ethics of beauty and co-founder of Beauty First films and um maybe Dr Tim and Jonathan can talk a little bit about how they know each other or other topics and then after that we'll take a few questions from the audience but just a few to keep our our Spirits high and then we'll have a nice reception outside where you can have a chance to share your thoughts afterward so thank you all and let's continue fantastic well thanks thanks Tim do you want to say more right off the bat about um this idea that it's just reality that the only one that can nothing can rule except it empties itself yeah yeah no so this is I mean this is really I didn't want to go into it too much but it is in some ways a technical Le true description you know and this is something that I think the more the more that people study complexity and they study also patterns of cognitive uh science they're realizing that that's actually how identity functions that in fact for for things to exist they always have to fit into higher participations right and this is as Christians it's like oh yeah we know that's true but it's not just true morally where we know that our Goods have to stack up and we have to let's say our Goods have to participate in higher Goods or else they become Idols that we can worship but that seems to be actually how reality Works itself because a simple example like you know it's like if I have a steering wheel and the steering wheel doesn't give itself to its participation in the car then it's ridiculous it's a it's a fetishized object that has no purpose and that's how all things function they always have to kind of give themselves up empty themselves into their into their higher participations uh and that seems to be that seems to be actually the way that we perceive reality and we're constantly moving as we engage with things we're constantly moving between the particular of an experience like you know if I'm if I'm drinking water I have to both attend to my fingers you know around the thing and the right pressure and everything but ultimately I'm also attending to the fact that I'm thirsty you know and and ultimately I'm attending to the fact that if I don't drink some point I'm going to die like there's a there's a of there's a kind of hierarchy of goods that stack onto each other and I think that this is the amazing thing about I think what Christ is revealing on the cross I don't want to I don't want it to feel like I'm diminishing what Christ is revealing on I think to the contrary Christ everything that we say morally about what Christ did is true but it also happens to be a description of how the world works you know and and also things also have to give themselves down they have to give themselves up up into higher participation but they also have to kind of give themselves down in a in a kind of flexibility towards variability and so like it I know it sounds it sounds technical but you know it's like for a steering wheel to exist it has to allow for variability of its existence it has to allow for all kinds of steering wheels to exist there can't just be one steering wheel that every there has to be like a million possible steering wheels you know but they all we all recognize them as a steering wheel even though they're all different from each other so identities always kind of give themselves down into their their variability but also give themselves up into participation into higher higher identities and so I think that the Incarnation you know when St Maximus talks about the fact that we all everything has a logos everything all the LOI are hidden behind all things in creation there's a way in which I you know right now in in in these different fields they are discovering this to true uh just about our experience of the world in general it's a fractal right a fractal thing sure um I'm going to ask another question we'll see if there's any relation before we get to the audience um you you hinted at this or you stated it that at the moment that the Roman soldiers thought they were mocking Christ by you know pret he's a fake King they actually were revealing who he really was yeah um does that work in our lives or does that work I mean I or does that work in the lives of saints that a moment where they're rejected or because when I think of for example sat narus because we've seen the movie man of God everyone's seen it when he's rejected how does that reveal that he's yeah yeah so Jesus Jesus uses these images you know he talks about the idea right that the stone that was rejected by the builders has become the head of the corner has become the Cornerstone or the I always think it's a keystone that's the best way to think about it right then you it's the stone that doesn't look like the others and then once you finish the arch then you oh that's where it goes it just holds the whole thing together um H and so you have this image of The Stumbling Stone and the Keystone or the the the Cornerstone and that also seems to be a feature about reality which is that uh the higher the higher identities like the higher things when they Peak into the world they don't look like the flat world they look different and so they look like you know that you can see it like the Pearl in the field right you need the whole field and then when you buy the whole field then you can get the Pearl but the Pearl isn't like the rest of the field the field is full of rocks but there's one thing in the field that shows its allegiance to more value and that's the I think that that's the one of the problems that happens is that people don't recognize that people because people are looking flat like their eyes are like this and they they just see the facts but they can't recognize the One Shining fact that is revealing the higher purpose of something and so because of that people tend to tend to reject it right it's like the logo shines into the world but the world does not recognize it and that seems to be a a sad fact of the Fall that that we we struggle to be able to to capture you know we we get stuck in the mire of what we're doing and we struggle to to see the the the the purpose um so I I don't want it to sound I hate when it sounds woo when I say it sounds woo so this is something that you deal with all all the time right imagine you're in a job and then people get caught up in the tasks that they're doing and they forget the reason why they're doing something and they don't know but they're dying and they don't even know that they're dying because they're busy and they're doing all these things and they're super busy but because they've forgotten their allegiance to a higher purpose they're dying and so you need someone to come a prophet even in your business like a little Prophet not a prophet from God but like a profet from the purpose of the company to come in and say hey wake up folks you're you you're supposed to be doing this for this reason you're not just doing a bunch of stuff like there's a reason you know but sometimes people hate that they hate it because it's annoying CU I'm busy and I'm doing all these things why are you bothering me with this this this up stuff you know uh and so you know what Jesus described is something that we are things that we deal with all the time I feel like that would be a great t-shirt people are dying but they don't know they're dying because they're busy they're busy yeah yeah yeah and you see that you know that that's definitely something that Happ definitely get some looks as you went through the theme park or wherever they don't busy yeah that's true um so that sounds a little bit like the ugly duckling right like the reason the duckling is ugly because it's a swan it's sorry if I gave that away to anyone doesn't know the story spoiler alert that's right but the um but I recall a story of a a Romanian abys who was absolutely loved and regarded as holy and would disappear one day a week and someone someone followed her to another part of Bucharest where where a very you know sort of rundown place where she sat in a gutter and people would just spit on her or something it's like what's that about what was going on in her psychology if no so so it does the thing is that we have to be careful like it so it so you see it in the image of Christ like you in the image of Christ you see the both Christ always showing the the both it's like when Christ comes into Jerusalem people love him people recognize him people see him as the king and so sometimes that happens like we have saints that don't that are just Saints and everybody sees it and they don't get persecuted and they don't get you know and then that's my kind of sa that's what I want to be I want to be that Saint when to recognize his whole life like St John christone people just you know loved him and I mean obviously he did get killed by the emperor but there that people but it's like people loved him and people recognize him and people so you have you have you have both of those stories are possible and I think in the story of Jesus you have you have an aspect which shows you people seeing the king and recognizing the Glorious one and then also people being blind to them and being caught up in their passions and in their and in their own distraction and then not seeing him so and in in that story by the way it seems like the nuns then sort of rejected the abbis on that basis like like at least Mally for a moment like what is she what is this yeah um like why is it the that that Saints tend to take uh take the the contempt like to take that on I mean they're definitely I I I they seem to be acting like Jesus you know and and that there seem we do seem to have the Poss the capacity to participate in what Jesus did I hate to say it because I don't want to do that but they seem to be able to take people's sins and for and in in in taking them and forgiving them they are healing the world somehow H and you see that I mean you see all these crazy stories of you know of of Abbotts you know or or you know Abbotts of going and confessing sins to to the to the novice but it's there it's the sin of the novice and then the novice is hearing his own sin being confessed by the Abbott and is like he's taking the sin of the and you hear like all these stories of saints who take the blame for other monks and stuff so you know it seems to be part of of reality it's kind of scary though because I like I said I really don't want to do that it's like when I see it I like oh that's amazing but that's rough should we go to the audience for questions now because I don't I think they want they want to come to you directly and I'll so does anybody have does anybody have a question there's I think there are two mics going through so it sounded like you said uh that the resurrection in the iconography and the and the scripture it's not like directly portrayed often but to me it seems like uh at least in the hymnography it's very direct you know it's very explicit you know you know the him hymnography of PCA of course you know how many times we say Christ has risen of course CH Place yeah of course Christ is R yeah so uh could you talk about like why in the hymnography it's like so so direct when the other in the iconography in the scrip no what I mean is that the resurrection itself is not portrayed and so we of course Christ is RIS it and of course he does appear to the disciples and ultimately reveals himself completely fully where they all recognize him but there seems to be something left of a mystery in the mechanism it doesn't doesn't want to simplify the the fact of it like it's it doesn't in in Scripture it doesn't say you know he knocked on the door I don't know like what it could say like like that that he opened the that he opened the tomb and he walked out or you see some some Jesus movies that do that it's not good like there are some Jesus movies they actually show them like in the Tomb and then like sitting up it's like o bad stuff that's bad stuff uh you know and so and so yeah and I think I think I mean I can't completely explain why that is but there seems to be there seems to be something about the resurrection that is meant to be kept uh mysterious you know not that it didn't happen but that it's not can't be reduced to a phenomena that we can that we can produce let's say that we could analyze and put it in a laboratory and say Here's how the resurrection works thank you that makes sense thank you Jonathan great to see you again it's good to see you father Yes I I think you gave the answer in your talk and you were trying to uh keep that uh tension between the two in other words is he the is he the king is he the the um humil humiliated one and I think the reason the church doesn't show and when you say Resurrection you mean his Resurrection coming out of the Tomb and I think there's a good reason for that and the reason is exactly what you showed us because there's a danger of that becoming um a form of historian ISM why because um it when you see the resurrection you don't have the other image that you showed in other words the humil humiliation because the whole thing is that it needs to be that's why the earliest icons of the Resurrection were the crucifixion like the Raba um depictions where you have um the crucified and risen one in other words the danger is to like you said if you get rid of that balance you have heresy the danger is to um say okay he on he's Divine and human and the human part died and then the divine part by itself Rose of course he rose because he's God God but then um first of all you're dividing him into two people in a sense but also the the church I believe um sees there's a danger there because then it doesn't matter to us in other words that's his thing it's not our resurrection and the the resurrection icon that finally came about uh basically is our Resurrection so because you said the eschatological aspect is always there and that's very that's very important uh because AR Ians want to want to always look from a western point of view a Renaissance point of view oh it must be a picture it must be a depiction of something in the past and therefore they say um because you never see that it always is anastasis anastasis means resurrection and Resurrection is a physical resurrection and he's not alone in the Orthodox icon whereas the westerners will have the the the banner and he's by all by himself but that's not described in uh the gospels for good reason and you have earlier um before the final anos IC developed you have besides the empty tomb that you showed you have other depictions of basically an empty tomb like like a house yeah maybe you've seen it there the old marbles of that again you don't have Christ by himself resurrecting because that can be misconstrued as oh of course he's God and that's that doesn't affect me so in a sense it's the danger of that separation of the one Myster because our theology starts from as your icon so beautifully showed he is the crucified and risen one in in one action you know trampling upon death by death and that's why all your icons showed both yeah and once you separate that then then you have a problem because then it becomes something that is made superficial in the sense that you lose that uh that radical newness well Western I'm not pointing fingers but it's a theological statement when you don't have this in the pasca the Easter just passed you know did you know that it happened I mean in a sense you see bunny rabbits you see chocolate but is it an existential event it's not because if it if you have Christ coming out of the Tomb then in a sense it's his thing see I got back at you guys I'm God of course and I I Rose but that other side the humiliation side is not there so I think that's that's what the the church is always keeping those two things together and the earliest celebration of pasca was a one night vigil where all these things were celebrated together you know the um crucifixion the death and the resurrection and that's why we say trampling upon death by death and pasca means suffering pasca also means resurrection and that's why all your icon showed that whole mystery being always um depicted together in other words together and you made that point and I think that's the answer to the question really that's a great that's a great insight and I love the idea that the that the anastasis icon is our Resurrection because when you look at images of the last judgment you see like when when Christ picks up Adam and Eve he's bringing them to the last judgment and you see them in the icon of the last judgment you know kneeling before the prepared Throne it's like that's it it is already our Resurrection you've seen the depiction I think it's torello or porch one of near Venice where yeah I did a whole talk on that and on top is the resurrection so it it's the end times it's it's esic and plus you're never going to see that emblem you know is it doesn't exist it's a and Resurrection means a resurrection and he's pulling them you know you're an artist he's pulling them behind the wrist it's it's physical they're heavy in other words it's a physical Resurrection because then we spiritualize it and then becomes chocolate and bunny rabbits [Music] hello uh thank you for coming today it was a very uh impelling talk uh to B kind of bounce off what you said earlier and to continue father's point of splitting the Christ the image of Christ as being the king and the the servant and that kind of sparked to mind like how sometimes in Catholicism they overemphasize the servant part with like for example Francis aisi and the ere exaggeration of like the image of the suffering and then also with like bringing to the Protestants the over emesis of the king the judge um the one that that rules everybody and it seems like an orthodox Heats they always bring it they bring it together they have the two um in unisy and I feel like that's kind of a theme in like the other the other fa like nominations is like the Catholics and the Protestants kind of take one thing from Orthodoxy but they only have they don't have the complete truth it's like a for historian ISM they split them and I wondering your thoughts on that well what I would say it depends like Orthodoxy has had a tendency to focus on the Imperial aspect you know especially when Byzantine uh emper Empire was quite strong that the the image of the of the Christ as Emperor was was more prominent in the East you know and the cross was less was less prominent and so I do believe that in the Theology and in the mystery we do have that that that joining together but we're not the Orthodox are not uh immune from excess sadly we wish we were but you know the Holy Spirit does the work over the long term and kind of brings things together ultimately but there are moments when we have tended to emphasize the uh the Imperial aspect of Christ quite quite uh a lot so oh hi thank you so much for your speech um one of my question is kind of relating to that but if we take the Hebrew the Biblical Hebrew and bring the hebraic emphasis onto this so for example the word gospel comes from basar and bassar literally means flesh so the word gospel is tied to this Hebrew idea already that is existing in the Old Testament so the fleshiness of God the blood the water the thorns all the imageries that you mentioned from the Old Testament maybe if we now that we have a chance to have concordances the way that the fathers and some of the iconographers did not have a chance to so if we reread the passion week but using the sepen but referring back again and again to the Hebrew words because that's the foundation of uh whatever is happening in the New Testament so do you think icons and our perception or what we're being scandalized about seeing too much of the fleshiness maybe or maybe we're ignoring the Imperial side too much what do you think bringing the hebraic direct Hebrew words onto the passion narrative how that would affect iconography thank you yeah uh well I I I believe that we do have the I think that we are we do have that tradition in the church I mean we through the Syrian fathers we have this whole hebraic thought that that that fed into the Orthodox world you know and and if you read St Ephraim and you read St Isaac you know you see that they're deeply thinking in hebraic terms so I think it's there in the in the church I'm always worried about you know our gospel is written in Greek and so I'm always worried about attempts to want to then too simply you know like speculate about what it's translating in Hebrew it's not completely useless but I would I'm I'm I'm always careful because you know it's it is a bit it is a bit speculative uh and I would tend to take you know I have a great love of St Efraim he's he's obviously one of my my great go-to people and so that's how I tend to do it you know and and see you know but I'm not you know I'm not against the idea but I would say it would had to be done cautiously you know yeah thanks for the great talk um I mean yeah sorry yes uh so you started your talk by talk by saying that Jesus came to conquer the Roman Empire and then you had my attention because obviously I'm interested in the Roman Empire yeah course your man yeah [Music] exactly but I also throughout the talk I I tried to look at the images as somebody living in the first second third uh century and of course this icons didn't exist but the mental images existed and were circulating so I thought that the the images themselves are very controversial yeah right because you have this uh Roman Empire that portrays Emperors and um Warriors as uh Godlike and and then you have somebody Jesus that is exactly the opposite so um and we had also earlier somebody brought it up that and you also that we many people prefer the humiliating Jesus so I was asking myself and I want your take on this uh did he conquer Rome as a king or as somebody who is humiliated no he did both I mean he he was both at the same time you know when St Paul it's so it's so crazy to read you know for example to know that these texts were written you know hundreds of years before Rome became Christian St Paul I forget in which passage he says he says right now he is ascending he is Conquering the principalities he is he's he's saying like Christ you don't see it but Christ right now he's Conquering the world he's actually going up the hierarchy he's subjugating all these principalities to himself all of these kingdoms are being submitted to him and you don't see it but it's happening and then and then ultimately you know a few years later then it it the fruits appear you know and and um the image of and we have to remember that the image of the kingly like the the son of man image is not is not just in Revelation right it's there all through the prophetic literature and but the the the mystery of of Christ is to join the image of the suffering servant and all of this image of of the the lowly descriptions of the Messiah in in scripture so like Joseph right so Joseph gets cast out into Egypt he's persecuted by his brothers he's Chas you know his brothers want to kill him all of this stuff is going on you know he's end up being a prisoner in a foreign land all of this is happening that's an image of the Messiah okay and then it's like oh then there's also this David figure who is like he's the he he plans the temple he's the ruling King he's this he's this great conquering uh hero it's like that's also an image of the Messiah and it's like like okay well how do you fit those two together you know and that's the mystery that's one of the mysteries of Christ is that he he shatters that you know he brings it all together into one one one opposite into these two opposites together uh and so I do I believe that that Christ you know that Christ conquered the Roman Empire both as a servant and as a king just like he did in his just as he was in his own his own life the image of one sews and another reaps although in this case Christ is the sewer and three centuries later the reaper Reaper yeah um I think we have time for one or two more questions so I I can't wherever you're doing a great job microphone people keep it up thank you Jonathan for being here we've all looked forward to it and uh we hope to see you back very soon again um uh I wanted to see if you would comment on the bridegroom icon specifically the um the image of the Reed and the icon so I know we have the other prophesy in Isaiah about he bruis Reed he shall not break but is there anything specifically about the Reed and the scepter and the properties of those two things that um that make them fit for for that icon yeah that's I'd never thought about it enough I don't think I have there's definitely something there there's definitely something there has to be an analogy between the crown of thorns and the kingly crown and the Reed and the scepter there has to be an analogy there but I don't I'm afraid that I don't completely see it but I'm on to it now so I'm going to I'm going to think about it but there has there has to be because it's so Mar it's so striking you know do you have to footnote that question when you when you write it out put it back I just put it back in there um yeah so I was noticing when you were talking about sorry right away sorry sry um when you mentioned uh uh earlier uh about Christ emptying emptying himself and uh how that makes him the only legitimate King uh it occurred to me that uh that has a lot of parallels I don't know how familiar you are with uh dosm but uh there's a number of parallels there I was just hoping uh maybe you would talk a little bit about some of those parallels and kind of reconciling that continuity yeah I don't know dosm enough to be able to make that comparison you know I know that there's a wonderful book uh on Christ and the and the da that has been written and CS Lewis seemed to have seen also a very strong relationship between the Loos and the Dao and so it is it is definitely quite possible that the that the Dos had an intuition about I mean the thing the thing about that once you realize that that that Christ that the Divine logos created the world it's not it's not shocking to realize that people would have had intuitions about about that before he was before he came because that's actually how the world works and so you know if there were people that were pure of heart if there were people that were you know that that that were not taken up by their passions then they would have had intuitions about about the same things that we that we teach to me that's not surprising it's that you know it's this whole idea of the uh of Justin Martyrs you know L ghost maos like this idea of the of Christ hidden in the world and hidden in reality because he is the source he's upholding the world um and so I to me the idea that that the doist or that other Traditions would have would have captured some element of of of the logos and how that works is not only is it not surprising but it just seems like completely inevitable you know and that's why like you know we have this idea of people of Christianity imposing itself and sometimes it has but many many times it didn't it basically was like a last key to the puzzle of other people's Traditions you know there there are even many Aboriginal uh you know native native tribes when they heard the story of Jesus you're like oh yeah of course that that fits it's like it ties everything together you know we've had the we have these traditions and then it's like here's the here's the key you know the the G people converted like that we don't like right away they just converted and so I think that I think that that's yeah that's true so I feel like there's one more person who's G to just burst if they don't ask that final question so who is that person is it someone down there maybe in the white sweater there or someone over here and this is the final one because hi thank you for your talk nice to see you up there so I just had a general question um if as an expert if you could explain the relationship between iconography and in for the individual in terms of meaning and what would you advise someone new to KN Christ is there a specific image that you would suggest looking at or anything that yeah that you've known to be really impactful well the icon of Christ is the is the C is the is the central image everything is in that image you know it's just the just the icon of of Christ who's who's there blessing with his right hand he holds a book in his left hand all of the all of iconography is is gathered into that image you know people often ask me like I'd like to commission one icon which one should it be it's like that's if you're going to just commission one icon that's the icon you should Commission because you know you can have an icon corner with a thousand icons or you can have an icon corner with the with the icon of Christ if you have the icon of Christ it's all gathered into that one image um so that's that's what I would suggest yeah well very sadly and reluctantly we've got to wrap up for tonight um Jonathan thank you very much for coming I don't know if you have one last word you want to say or well I want to thank I want to thank uh thank you thank Holy Cross for for coming you know it's been great I was able to come with my wife and my daughter uh and you know you all received them wonderfully beautifully I I was really happy to see you know my family making relationships and even my daughter you know talking to students and all that that's been to me that's been a a great joy so so I'm happy to been able to come thank you thank you very much for coming everyone good night
