the picture that this organization W paath had presented to the world was a picture of real professionalism grounded in the best available science and evidence it is not there is no evidence-based to support these radical interventions which is puberty blockers cross- seex hormones meaning testosterone for females and estrogen for males and genital surgeries which are of course irreversible the assumption is that you are trans and I think because if you accept that this mistreatment is widespread it is so [Music] damning hello everybody I'm talking today with journalist and author Michael shellenberger and Michael wrote apocalypse never why environmental alarmism hurts us all and ALS so San Francisco he has a new book coming out called pathocracy it won't launch until next year um but I'm talking to him today about something more specific uh and more controversial I suppose and that's the recent his recent release of the so-called W path files now W path is the arguably an association but certainly not professional and also an organization that has like nothing to do whatso ever with health and so we walk through his release of about 170 pages of material uh documenting the activities of this group and we're going to see what happens as a consequence so come on board for the ride you were instrumental in the release of the so-called W path files very recently and you keep dumping catastrophes into the public sphere yeah yeah who knew that would be role so but you seem to be playing it very effectively so why don't you tell us what's CLW Us in man take us from the talk well sure so this is the organization in question is called the world professional association for transgender health and it's called W path and it's an organization I hadn't heard of until a source or sources gave me about 1170 pages of the internal files from the discussion Boards of wpath along with uh about a 90minut video of wpath leaders and members talking about some of the problems they were encountering and so what you're seeing in these files and I encourage people to read the files themselves there's really no substitute for confronting the evidence directly what you see are conversations about how to treat or mistreat I think I would say people who are experiencing gender distress as ages as young as 10 years old 14 years old there's a discussion of a 13-year-old adolescent with developmental delays there's a conversation about whether to perform genital surgeries on somebody that's suffering from symptoms like schizophrenia and maybe homeless concerns expressed about whether that person will be able to care for their wound uh supposedly a Neo vagina sorry to get right into it right away but this is the material we're discussing there's a lot of conversations about the problems they have in getting kids and adolescents and their parents to understand that these procedures will result in sterilization and likely a loss of sexual function the picture that this organization W paath had presented to the world and to the American Medical Association the American Academy of Pediatrics the endocrine Society every major medical organization was a picture of real professionalism grounded in the best available science and evidence they have something called standards of care which are ostensibly guidelines for proper medical care for people suffering from so-called gender dysphoria or gender distress and they're in their eth version of that so they call it standards of care 8 or sock 8 based on their Public Presentation you would think that this is a serious scientific and professional body it is not when you read these documents what you see is a lot of spitballing a lot of people making things up you don't see a lot of references to what's in the standards of care but even if you did you would learn that what's in the standards of care is effectively pseudoscience there is no evidence-based to support these radical interventions which is puberty blockers cross- seex hormones meaning testosterone for females and estrogen for males and then surgeries both they euphemistically referred to as top and bottom surgeries and people can understand that's we're talking about breast elimination double masectomy for uh girls as young as 13 14 15 years old and genital surgeries which are of course irreversible including on adolescence it's extremely shocking to read these conversations there's so much to unpack in them I think there's a kind of horror to it that for people like me that have tried to stay away from this for a long time I've certainly heard you talk about it and seen you write about it I'd seen I'd read Abigail shri's book but honestly my psych logical reaction until I was confronted with these files and asked to effectively bring them into the world uh was of denial I just didn't really think that these things were going on at the scale at which they're occurring I may I thought maybe people were exaggerating what's happening these files put to rest any doubts anybody should have that what is happening is one of the greatest medical mistreatment scandals in human history in recorded human history it might be the worst it's certainly up there with otomies it's up there with the Tuskegee experiments it's way worse than both of those it's I think you may be right it's so bad and so there's a lot to unpack but anyway that's the that's an overview of it it's 170 Pages the video oh the one final thing I'll say Jordan is just that it also shows without shadow of a doubt that they themselves the people that are performing these mistreatments are aware that they are not getting what's called informed consent this is as important as Do no harm so they are acknowledging that the kids and the parents don't understand that and then they just sort of throw up their hands and they say yeah we don't really know how to solve this problem at no point in the video does anybody say hey maybe we shouldn't be doing this it's it's a it's a truly just from the you know there's a basic horror to it but then at the intellectual level you can't help but be slightly fascinated by these people what is wrong with them that they're so in the grip of an ideology that they're doing these mistreatments and never questioning uh effectively never questioning that that perhaps they shouldn't be doing them at all yep okay so let's walk through that right right from right right through everything you said so we're going to start with the professional association okay so it turns out apparently that all you have to do to become a professional association that other professional associations can rely on is to call yourself a professional Association and the way you finesse that if you aren't actually a professional association which means you're not you're not a group of scientists and you're not qualified to be doing what you're doing is to Proclaim as loudly as you can that you're operating on behalf of someone who's oppressed because then it becomes a moral crime to question anything you say and so that means if you're an absolute bloody narcissistic  who's also incompetent the best way to clam clamber yourself to the top of a hierarchy that would otherwise be unattainable to lie about who you are and what you're doing so great so that's a wonderful invitation to the uh willfully blind narcissistic Psychopaths okay so that accounts for wath and then with regards to the medical associations and the psychological associations who've got along with this in the most despicable imaginable way well they can point to the fact that they consulted the true experts and who more to know than those with lived experience in the area right so great we've got all sorts of excuses at hand okay so that's appalling on the professional side and what it really is is the invasion of of what would you say domains of specialization that once required effort by parasites who use ideology to game the system so great now that's the American Psychological Association that's the American Medical Association the American Psychiatric association and it's certainly W paath inexcusable I've never seen anything like this I'm absolutely appalled and ashamed of my my therapist colleagues for example of not being rioting in the streets because of this that brings us to the next issue in in your progression because then you describe gender distress okay so let's think about that two words gender and distress okay right distress is indistinguishable from two things generalized negative emotion and absence of positive emotion okay so that's the core for depression and anxiety and it's the core set of symptoms for virtually every form of pathology that comes to the attention not only of psychologists but also of medical professionals right so distress is a very very large bin and what you do if you're a credible diagnostician is you assume to begin with that the more generalized diagnosis applies depression and anxiety and then you further specify that as necessary understanding that a lot of what you might attribute to the more specialized problem is actually a manifestation of the more General problem right because one question is is well what the hell is the difference between gender distress and anxiety and depression and the answer is mostly nothing mostly nothing and so maybe there's something left over that's specific to something like body dysmorphia but probably not and you need pretty solid proof that there is something in addition and then see that's another part of the slight of hand because you might say well people with gender dysphoria are more likely to commit suicide it's like no depressed and anxious people are more likely to commit suicide you have to demonstrate that there's an additional utility in your diagnostic label and that turns out to be extremely difficult but we've we're way past all that okay so so now then we have the additional lie so we've mucked up the notion of distress now we've appended another lie to it some of this distress is attributable to confus confusion about gender there's no difference about confusion between confusion about gender and confusion about identity right those are the same thing and everybody who seeks psychological treatment has confusion about identity that's why they seek treatment so you can't just take all that and rename a gender and think that you can get away with it although apparently you can so that's appalling on the conceptual side it's inexcusable there's no there's no reason whatsoever that any psychologist orsy or physician who's been trained remotely in the Mental Health Sciences should ever fall for that even for a second no matter what but they did okay next next and this is the progression that you laid out okay so now we have gender distress as uh delineated by a pack of professionals who aren't professional and who aren't a pack and are certainly not a professional association and what do they recommend they don't recommend the minimal necessary intervention so so the clinical literature 6 years ago was absolutely clear with regard to the small number of cases of gender dysphoria that emerged in early childhood very rare one in 3,000 very rare leave them the hell alone right till they're 18 yeah most of them turn out to be gay and 90% of them and the existence of that final 10% is highly debatable accept the physical reality of their embodiment right so so the the rule is don't do anything stupid now the the man who established that who was the what's it Ken Zucker right he ran the best Journal that dealt with childhood gender dysphoria for years up in Toronto that was his recommendation for treatment and the Bloody radicals ran him out of business 10 years ago right that's when all this idiocy started up in Toronto which bloody well figure okay so so the okay so now you're not supposed to do anything right just wait bad treatment is worse than no treatment okay but no we're not going to do that we're going to do the opposite we're going to take the most extreme possible imaginable surgical intervention and then we're going to combine that with the most extreme possible imaginable imaginable hormonal intervention and then we're going to recommend that and we're going to tell people that if they don't listen their children are going to die right they're going to commit suicide which is a complete bloody lie there was never a bit of evidence for that not even bad evidence it was just a lie and then and then to top it all off we're going to offer this absolutely cataclysmic treatment with unimaginably dire consequences to people who don't even understand and can't understand what they're agreeing to right then we're going to promise them that's how they'll find their true self right right so that's where we're right it's so sickening it's so sickening that that well and let's close with your final point you said you'd you'd heard a little bit from Abigail shrier you heard a little bit from me there's been some other people screeching and bitching about this in the background like I knew this was coming back in 2016 I could see it just absolutely clearly I knew it was going to affect young women primarily because that's historical part for the course but you said you know you're a pretty astute guy and you're actually also pretty open to the revelation of uncomfortable material but you said that even you were enticed into well into what exactly like what did you think of Abigail okay why I think it was some I mean it was I should say I mean I wasn't totally it's gradual but I mean I I and I think it's important to talk about because I think if we want to figure out how to end this we do have to figure out how to get through to people and I've been certainly talking about this with my friends and family who are very Progressive for a couple of years now and the most the most recent argument was last summer with I don't want to say who but people that I'm close to and they also engage in a kind of denial that this was in any way widespread because I think that when I was describing a particular D transitioner who i' had gotten to know and whose case I've talked a little bit about and I think because if you accept that this mistreatment is widespread it is so damning it is such an indictment it's not just it's an indictment of the entire what they call the chain of trust from the the the pseudo scientists to the practitioners to the associations to the news media psychologist psychiatrists the institutions every every I mean every phal companies yeah far drug companies the indictment is so serious and it goes right and you're you're I'm I'm very excited to talk to you about it all Jordan because I think that it really goes to just the the rotting away of the core restraints the society used to impose the the the the the guardrails you know the gatekeeping and what's I want to clarify one thing by the way which is that in the files they don't talk about gender distress that's more neutral language that some of the people in the gender critical movement use they just think they're all trans if you are someone that expresses confusion about your gender identity the assumption is that you are trans and it clearly comes right out of the gay rights movement where there was a sense in which and this is I think what's been so you know um that the heart of a lot of it for how liberals accepted it was that I think a lot of us accepted gay relationships and same-sex relationships and the innateness of them and so when it came to trans it basically was just the application of this rule of innateness onto trans there was never a question that there was a misdiagnosis and a mistreatment two separate things by the way misdiagnosis and mistreatment and then when you kind when it just runs away and it's like you know the front page the cover of Time Magazine and it's all the ma everybody's talking about this is the new form of Liberation and then you had as you were saying there's different characters right there's the there's the Psychopaths and the narcissists who are who are the bullies and they're sort of mes the narcissists are mesmerizing people the psychopaths are bullying people and then the all of the nice guys all of the kind liberals the compassionate caring liberals cave and and they kind of go I can't deal with it so that I'm talking about the journalists the medical associations the other doctors it is the Democrats the Democrats the Liberals I mean it is it is a just an absolutely shocking cowardice Dogma psychopathologies you know you look at the people that are really sadism don't forget sadism I mean that's a fun addition yeah we're going to write I mean there's there's there were going to be there will be books written about this episode that I mean I don't want to race ahead to looking back I know Parton May that maybe my coping mechanism this all has to be stopped I mean this is I will say and you probably will probably get to it but you one week after we released the W path files Britain's National Health Service came out and finally banned puberty blockers and all of its clinics the times of London then came out the next day this is a center left newspaper they called this quack medicine in the lead editorial they called for expanding the band they were worried they are worried as we should be that puberty blockers are still going to be prescribed in private clinics but you could see with the w path files the NHS decision I huge opening were finally people that had I think including me that had been sort of quiet on this maybe a little bit like unsure is this my role to speak out on this finally going no this is absolutely Bonkers and has to be stopped this is a this is a yeah maybe the greatest medical mistreatment Scandal of the last you know 100 years 200 years I don't know um it's hard to it's hard to identify a worse one and it's hard to identify a worse it's like it's like unit 7 what was it unit 713 the Japanese uh that's Japanese medical experiments on on the Chinese when they invaded that's the worst that's the worst of the horrors that I've ever uh familiarized myself with this is at that level and that's really something it's it's because the nitty-gritty of the details of this are so shocking that you can't believe it's true you just with and I'll one one other final detail uh the per the picture is oh yeah we're doing all the science the people will they in these CH in these conversations the doctors will say well I don't know I mean we haven't seen anybody really come into complain with us at least the people we followed up with over the few weeks after the surgeries there's like not only is there no serious study or followup of the victims of these mistreatments they they're not interested it's a complete abdication of responsibility by everybody involved nobody even chimed in and said hey maybe we should follow up with these people what about the person that had tumors on their on their liver maybe we should find that person we did not see this anywhere in the files like nobody piped up and tried to take responsibility it was a complete abdication of responsibility it was just it's just this kind of M I that we have we're going to mess with people's bodies and then we don't care what happens afterwards it's almost like they're

I'll contextualize that every profession attracts a range of temperamental talents that have as associations their temperamental Temptations right so there's more narcissists among movie stars and politicians and media people obviously well there's more sadists among those who cut up people for a living right that doesn't mean they're all that way certainly it doesn't mean that at all that's that is not at all the point well and we haven't even we haven't even talked about one of the absolute bloody horrors of this which is the fact that it's unbelievably profitable you know I saw a projection this was three years ago some idiot consultant company came up with a you know 130 page PDF showing uh the trans industry as its growth projections for the next seven years right in this like marketing speak it's like well it's it's going to go from a few hundred million to something you know something approximating .3 billion in the next seven get in well the getting's good you know and every bloody butcher that H can't make a living as a genuine physician and surgeon can easily turn their attention to producing like pseudo penises out of cut off flesh it's it's it's so sickening it's so but again I want to I want to concentrate on your response because it's very interesting to me a because look I've watched Canadians become selectively blind in Canada over the last 10 years and I can understand why really can't it's like here's the situation in Canada for 150 years every single one of our major institutions was middle of the road and reliable the the the United Church that's kind of the mainstream Protestant organization in Canada or the Catholics if you're French Canadian you know they had their problems but they weren't they weren't uh they weren't completely pathologized let's put it that way you could rely on them same with the news media same with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation even though it was a crown Corporation um you could basically trust them same with the universities same with the education system it's not like it was top rate but it wasn't riddled with pathology and this is a terrible thing for someone with a conservative bent to to you know to indicate it's like well none of that's true anymore the the the federal liberals subsidized the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation to the tune of $1.4 billion a year for no customers right but that's where everybody over over gets their news it's like I told my mother a year ago everything the CBC tells you is a lie and she said well where am I supposed to get my news which is a really good question right so so you imagine the conundrum that faces people it's like all the institu you you have two choices either those like me who are screaming about this are like right-wing conspiratorial lunatics or all those things you thought you could trust like the hierarchy you just described to the medical community you can't trust that anymore well yes well first of all extraordinar Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence so even if you were just using a rule of thumb you you'd screen out the the people who are you know crying in the wilderness so to speak and this is even worse but but I'm very curious about it in relationship to you because like you've already you investigated the Twitter files for example you've already seen this happen but you said that even in your case what do you think it was that made you initially resistant to to believing that this might be the case it's just too shock I mean I think it's interesting for your I think I was think about your work you talk in your some of your earlier work was about kind of finding yourself uh disoriented or thrown into a sense of chaos after the after these foundational things you were the the things you had counted on or believed in and I still had that around some sense of the medical system I still had some confidence in the medical system before really getting into this and I think that was part of what was uh a barrier I mean I I read Abigail shri's book twice I spoke to her on the phone multiple times I think she grew a little frustrated with me because I think there was a sense among some gender critical folks of like where are the men I don't mean I mean I don't want to overly gender it but there was a sense in which it's disproportionately women that have been raising the alarm about this you're one of the you know you and some of the other folks at dailywire exception I think but I think she was a little annoyed with me which is like why is it taking so long um we did publish a few articles on it then we got the de path files but there's that sense of like you know look if this is really what it appears to be and now we have the evidence overwhelming that it is in the wpath files you have everything you need to know that this is just as awful as it appears to be if that's true then you cannot trust the American Medical Association the endocrine Society you cannot trust the health insurance companies you cannot trust the hospitals you cannot trust the doctors it means that this this the fancy word for this of course is iatrogenesis that's the when the when the medical system makes people sick it's an old phenomenon there's a wonderful Book fourth leading cause of death fourth leading cause of death and that was before that was before that was when it was functioning right we have no idea what its contribution to death is now especially in the aftermath of the vaccine compulsion right we have no idea we may never find out you know maybe we will but but we might not yeah it's really it's really okay so fine part is Al I want to be I want to respect local knowledge and so I know that the people that call themselves environment I knew the people that were calling themselves environmental NOS weren't really saving the environment like that was my life's work for 20 years I then discovered the same thing on homelessness these are not people that are trying to end homelessness they're trying to enable addiction and prevent the proper medical care of people with psychiatric disorders and serious mental illness you then get to this and it's such a grotesque perversion of the promise of of Health Care and a perversion as you were saying before of the lesbian gay rights and bisexual movement they're they're they're literally destroying the bodies of people that if you left them alone would almost most of them would grow up to be gay lesbian bisexual so you should see the gay rights movement be the first out there to express outrage but of course they've been they were the first to get co-opted by it you know the corruption of it it starts it starts with the people that would have been the first line of defense if you had said there's going to be an effort to to completely undermine the the the reproductive capacity and sexual function of gay lesbian and bisexual adolescence you would have said well no the lesbian gay bisexual movement would never allow that no they just they're part of it the LGBT movement they facilitated it so okay let's zero let's zero in on that that because we might as well go where you know yeah for sure Angels Fear To Tread okay so so let me um how I don't let me contextualize this first or can I I have a lot of thoughts on this too I'm excited to get into this all right so one of the things we wrestled with with this Alliance for responsible citizens ship that I put together that you came you you mentioned it earlier um that that we had our first Conference in October is we have a family policy okay and we we had a lot of scraps about that and part of the reason for that was be there was a lot of reasons but one of the reasons was we had a number of people who were gay who were in our Advisory Group and we were very happy to have them and but our sense was that the header the longterm relationship oriented header heterosexual couple is the Bedrock for the communal Enterprise and that can't be replaced okay and so then we really we argued about that a lot and part of the reason we argued about that was because that relationship is honored in the breach More Often by most people than it's honored in the in the uh what would you say in the celebration so like in my own family for example there's plenty of people my own immediate and extended family I suppose the divorce rate in my extended family is approximately the same as the national divorce rate I I don't imagine it's any different and so you know there's plenty of single mothers there's plenty of divorced people there's plenty of people who have affairs there's plenty of gay people uh there's plenty of single people so there might be even a majority of those people you know if you if you looked at it cross-sectionally but and so what does that mean does it mean that you destroy the ideal upon which Community it's self is founded it's like no I don't think so I think you have to live with the tension between the ideal and the exception and it's something like you establish the core and then there's a zone of tolerance for the margin and not only tolerance appreciation for the experimentation that could take place on the margin but then you have the demand now to put the margin in the center and my sense of that was well that's fine except now the margin of the margin will come forth and if they're not frightening enough then The Fringe of the margin of the margin will come forth and if you're not frightened then that's because you're not paying attention and like this is a big problem and so I want to delve into this it's such a core problem because you said yourself and this was part of your resistance I think if i' if I've got this right is that we had this movement of liberalization of the concept of the conception of coupling and family that really let's say unrolled in the from the 1960s to the 1980s and culminated in the almost Universal acceptance I would say of let's say gay marriage and that was an attempt to bring homosexuality and I would say mostly on the male side um but I I think the evidence that male homosexuality is like a permanent part of the human condition and biologically predicated I think it's quite strong now why that is is a very difficult question but in any case we all agreed that we could expand the conception of the core to include those relationships and over time even the more conservative people more or less came aboard I would say but but then we got this morph and you and you and and you said the thing that's so bloody perverse about it it's like in a way here's an argument and I'm not making this a canonical argument we reconfigured the norm and the ideal but that invited something even more marginal to make itself manifest and and then you said yourself that that new marginal identity was then conceptualized in the same civil rights oriented terms and the consequence of that this is what's so cool and so horrible the consequence of that wasn't further degeneration of the nuclear family the consequence of that was that the first people on the firing block were the were the gay was the gay community right because as you said if if the conservatives had conspired to produce a catastrophe that was aimed more horribly at the gay community they couldn't have done worse than this yeah it's it's beyond comprehension right it's it's truly Beyond so so what do you like so what do what do you think that now first of all is the tension between the the lesbian and gay rights movement and its extension into this trans domain was that part of what um motiv your psychological resistance and then also what do you think about how this unfolded what do you make of that well so I think so yeah so I mean first of all I am I'm from the left I've I'm obviously much more uh uh I've abandoned a lot of those radical left views but I'm still very high on openness in terms of Personality trait right so I'm sort of like so if a if a man if a biological male wants to dress up as a woman and go out in public dressed up as a woman my first instinct is I'm fine with that like why it's a free country you should be able to do that and then and and so and I think this is an I'm using this case in particular because you may know that there are two psychologists who have done a lot of work studying the people that call themselves trans women we might say trans identified males or you or you know you say trans women it's fine but there's two psychologists uh Ray Blanchard and um oh my God go now I'm blanking on the second one um basically two psychologists have done the research on on these men and they've identified them they say they're they say that what what it is it's autogynephilia the word they've invented Blanchard right so it's um nobody disputed that by the way five years ago every mainstream clinician who was educated understood this right that that that transsexualism was an autogynephilic condition right right and it primarily affected men or primarily manifested by men and it it often was fully realized let's say in in the in their 30s and 40s although there might be a history of such Behavior like the psychoanalysts had a whole well-developed Theory which I think is one that's very like the the theory there in part the Deep Theory the one that I thought was most appropriate was that these were often men who and this goes along with the openness idea who had constrained the development of their personality in the stereotypically masculine Direction too much they'd put a a more open temperament into a twoo tight box and what was happening was that the impulse to have them develop the cross seex proclivities that might have expanded their personality that was all suppressed and it emerged in a a warped and sexualized Manner and they started to play out in the world what they should have been manifesting as a psychological transformation right that's a yion take it's a great take it's a great take and so the play that autophilia is a form of sexualized play in relationship to Identity transformation and I think that's I think that's and by the way it's Mike the other psychologist is Michael Bailey and he wrote a book on it so it's really these two characters twoy book I can't I it's something I think it was something like the man who be a woman yeah that's the man who would be Queen yeah right I know blanchards work and that work too yeah yeah so yeah so they they come out with this theory of autog gilia which is the uh defined as the attraction to oneself as a woman or it's having the fantasy of oneself as a woman it's a sexual fantasy of oneself as a woman and this was pretty well supported these you know these two psychologists really did a lot of work on it and then some of the autog gyil men started going after Bailey I think in particular and Blanchard actually talked about having survivors guilt cuz he felt like he had helped develop the concept but biley took the brunt of the attacks and it was was trying to get him fired and they were harassing him and they were doxing him and it was very very shocking treatment and they basically the I think they both came to conclusion at least Bailey did that they were undermining the fantasy and absolutely AB absolutely and these autog gyil men were attacking them for undermining the fantasy now well look Michael what happens is okay well you can see this with these with these like absolutely abor displays of narciss istic fetishism online you get these men who are dressed up as women but who couldn't pass as a woman for anyone within like a 200 yards of them you know but their fantasy see they idealize themselves in their fantasy play as a sexually attractive woman because what the hell good is the sexual fantasy without that and then that is undermined by any evidence whatsoever that what they're making manifest as imagination is tantamount to a delusion and so they they get narcissistically outraged just like a 2-year-old or a three-year-old who's who's disrupted in their fantasy playing it's like well you know you're not really a woman it's like well what do you mean I'm not really a woman my the entire fantasy is predicated on the in oce that not only am I a woman but I'm a beautiful hyper feminine woman I'm the best of all I'm the best of all possible women and you the fact that you would dare to oppose that there's two two interpretations either I'm delusional beyond belief or you're you're cruel well right easy figure out which one of those that they're going to take and then they go and Bully everybody around them and they use they use I mean honestly I just think it's Psychopathic like the the tactics they're using showing no regard for others engaging in very high-risk behavior and who and so you look at these folks and and these people are the leaders they're the ones that are the president of w paath they are this the surgeon Marcy Bowers who's the president of wath she's fun she's real fun she who who operated who who blocked the puberty of jazz Jennings yeah uh did a botched surgery a botched genital surgery on Jazz there's a video of mar and we and we publicized that for for like tens of millions of dollars to the entire what when the entire lowlevel IQ team TV watching community and glamorized it and glamorized it and sacrificed JZ Jennings in the process and what would you say brought his stunningly narcissistic mother into exactly the kind of Spotlight that her cluster be personality demanded right and and her child was a small price to pay for that right it's so shocking so basically you have a situation where when you piece it all together you have a situation of powerful narcissist and Psychopathic men who in order to fulfill their sexual fantasies are needing to construct the idea and then the reality of trans children and this is where the it really well that's how they get out of the moral conundrum Michael because so sure because and this is a typical Psychopathic narcissist move it's like I bear no moral respons ibility for that in fact I've always been like this and the fact that that wasn't recognized is an indication of two things my unbelievable moral virtue and and and specialness because I was that sort of special person and the absolute pathology of anyone who got in the way which was basically you know the entire world the entire patriarchy everyone that knew them right right it's it's so it's so narcissistic that it it it Beggars belief it beggar Bel right so so my understanding you're obviously the expert uh my understanding is that Psychopathic narcissists the psychopathy is in service of the narcissism and so if being an autog gynophile is a kind of narcissism the psychopathy then is that you will you don't care about the feelings of others and you'll engage in highly risky behaviors in order to service your narcissism that that's how it work yeah well service well and well we should we could qualify that even further because I think it's useful to do so so you what's the difference between a mature person and an immature person okay so well well first of all hope that we can all agree that there is a difference between like a toddler and a responsible adult you know because otherwise why would we grow up okay so what characterizes a toddler well a toddler is characterized by possession by a sequence of whims okay so why is that counterproductive well because the toddler wants what he wants right now no matter what okay so what does that mean no matter what it means no matter what it costs his future self and no what matter what it costs other people okay so why is that bad well you if you betray your future self you die and if you can't get along with other people then well then you die you can't engage in in reciprocal altruism for example so what you try to do when you socialize children is that you extend their purview so that as their cortex integrates they're able to regulate their impuls of whim in accordance with their future self and with other people right so that's like the definition of maturity right and that okay so you're you're perfectly describing and explaining one of the things in the files that we see over and over again you also see in the Jazz Jan show which is it's a complete focus by the by the gender quacks to to service some to service somebody's needs right now without any sense of what will the consequences will be in the future there on the video one of the people literally says well we just want to provide that care and comfort right now well but you're talking about you're talking about lifelong stability and loss of sexual function and you're actually concerned and then similarly you see this Dr Marcy Bowers who's operating on Jazz Jennings obsessed with doing surgical procedures having an argument in the while conducting the surgery in the operating room having an argument with her colleague who's telling her that she doesn't need to remove what she's calling star tissue she says no I hate it I hate it you can see her she's just really really she's like I got to get rid of that because it's got to look this right way it's they're playing I mean to really get into it they're playing God they're trying to play God and of course the problem is they're not gods and so they but it's like it's like they're just there's a sense in which you read this they're just they're yeah they're like toddlers they're just wrecking things they're just they don't care and there and there's no sense of the future you pointed to something since we're going down the rabbit hole that's even worse I would say well look there's a lot of things going on underneath this and one of them is the devouring mother okay so what's a devouring mother okay let's well let's define that technically now Freud intuited that the edle situation was at the root of much Psychopathology now he over sexualized that that was a mistake but the core Insight was brilliant and here's the Insight okay so human infants are born in an incredibly underdeveloped state that the there's a couple of reasons for that but the fundamental reason is that our brains are so big that in order for us to be born through a functional female pelvis we had to be born in in in a fetal stage that's why our heads are compressible it's a it's a compromise now the cost that we pay for that is the unbelievable vulnerability of human infants okay now the cost the mothers pay for that is that the the ne the neonate is so dependent that they need 100% care okay so that means that the the impetus of agreeableness that personality trait in combination with negative emotion that's that's the two feminine personality traits High negative emotion and high agreeableness the purest expression of that is give the suffering infant what it needs right now no matter what right okay and that's perfectly legitimate for six months for for an infant well for six months for six months it's the right attitude now okay so then so and it's a very very powerful Instinct it's the maternal Instinct upon which the human species depends okay the question is what happens when that pathologizes okay so what does it look like when it pathologizes well the first is you treat a one-year-old like a six-month year old or you treat a 5-year-old like a six-month-old you just give into whatever they want right now well that means that you start to interfere with their development that's where the devouring mother comes in right okay and so and that's very very bad that's how you make useless entitled narcissistic privileged dependent and terrified children right who also hate their parents right so that's a very bad idea okay but it but here's here's something even worse than that which no one will talk about and which no one will contend with okay that maternal instinct is hyper powerful and it's the defining characteristic of femininity the question that our culture is facing now is what happens when that when women enter into the political Arena and that instinct doesn't find its proper place and the answer is as far as I can tell is that childless women infantilize everything yep yeah well God Michael that's true we are in serious trouble like you know because we know the most woke disciplines for example in the universities are the ones with the highest percentage of women now I'm I'm don't get me wrong I'm not blaming women and because I think men have abdicated the responsibility on that front as well and I'm also not unhappy that we've been able to determine how to capitalize on the broad intellectual abilities of women in the broader in the broader civilizational scheme of things let's say that's not my point my point is is that we don't know what sort of political psychopathologies will be specific to females and we bloody well know now and part of that's that that infantilization of everything and then there's another Associated issue which is women are also very good let's say at spotting Predators okay if you have an infant and you misidentify a predator you know you call something a predator that isn't whatever you protect your baby it's not a problem it's kind of hard on the misidentified Predator MH right and so part of that cluster be proclivity of the psychopathological woman to cry wolf continually and profit thereby is also a manifestation of that maternal Instinct it's right you oppose me you must be a predator and if you're this is the terrible thing about the devouring mother pathology is if you're a predator no punishment is too harsh for you right no quarter right why would you give quarters something that wants to eat your child right it's like no quarter and so that's that's another problem that we have that we have no idea what to do with so well yeah I I was going to just say a couple thoughts about that I mean I think that so first of all yeah I mean you look at jazz jenning's Mom that's absolutely how she but then you look at her dad and Jazz's Dad here they are the surgery's boted you know you I just watched some of the video from it the the surgery's botch and the dad's kind of like well yeah it didn't quite go like we thought it was you know what what I have heard when I talk to the parents of of the D transitioners and the desisters the desisters of course are the parents that got their that saved to their kids before real danger was done what they say is they go often the dad was finally like I don't want to do this the dad had to step in and say no and perform that role that traditionally I'm not saying what dads do that's what Dad supposed to do D yeah yeah they're supposed to be like no yeah um that didn't happen um and then the uh but then also just you pull back even further and you go what is this really about look what they're doing they're blocking puberty PU puberty is a fundamental human right growing up is a fundamental human right they're depriving people of the right to be an adult that's what the Witch and Snow White does that's so interesting that is I'm I'm it's it's it's a it's a standard form of female pathology which is that's how you eliminate competitors H right right yeah no kidding no kidding it's really bad well it's you know you know the story of Snow White is that she's the most beautiful which means she's funed and she's she's at her Peak but the next generation is coming and she's going to be supplanted and so instead of accepting that gracefully and making the transition to grandmother which is what she should do she attempts to prolong her her youthful adulthood Beyond its acceptable point and she does that by sacrificing the upand cominging next feminine generation exactly exactly so she poison snow white yeah yeah she's the witch that lives in the forest and has always lived in the forest yes yes it's well so the witch is in power I mean this is what's so shocking about it is that the witch is in power like across all these institutions and the men are completely you know uh simped out I don't know how else describe it the men have abdicated their Authority abdicated their responsibility the core responsibility of the father at a minimum these dad all these dads are focused on playing with their kids protect your kids protect your kids from these creepy these deeply creepy doctors that are trying to prey on your child I mean I couldn't it's so it's so it gets to the spiritual stuff too I think because I watched the Barbara Walters special on Jazz Jennings before they G they they performed this horrible surgery on her Barbara Walters opens that special Barbara Walters that like trusted face of the news media right I mean she's like the the she's like Walter kronite is dead but Barbara Walters is still there someone like my parents my family would rely on she gets up and she goes beautiful little girl born into the wrong body I mean I I look at I I've been working on nihilism and and the ways in which nihilism is the I mean when you are sterilizing your children when you are depriving them sexual function when you are denying them puberty you are you are you are just it's nihilism I mean you're just saying no to life you're negating life you're negating your own immortality project that's how most a lot of people feel like their lives have meaning that goes on by having kids and then grandkids so the the hard nihilism of it and underneath it is a kind of Hedonism of the immediate pleasure of exercising your power over other people's bodies or or your body I think that nihilism is at the heart of this I just look at and I go this is I mean nihilism you know in the in the nian sense in the classical sense is just a kind of rejection of reality for some alternative World sleep is

which is the like so I would say your concentration on nihilism is insufficiently pessimistic because nihilism is a step on the way to resentment right and resentment man if you're looking for if you're looking for a cardinal sin resentment is it's a contender it's a contender for what's at the bottom resentment arrogance and deceit you know those they those make one evil evil Tri while we were talking about power the reason I brought up the infants to begin with is because there's this Unholy relationship between power and Hedonism because I will turn to Power to gratify my heathenism because I don't have to otherwise like if if I can invite you to play along with me and you want to well I don't need to use power the only time I need power is when I want you to do something that you don't want to do and worse than that I want you to do something that isn't going to be good for you in the medium to long run that's also not going to be good for me you know because one of the things I've been looking into for example is the uh the personality structure of short-term maters so like human beings are a pair bonding species that that invest heavily in their offspring but within the human realm there are like temperamental long-term maters and let's say temperamental short-term maters and you might say well who are the on night stand crowd so these are the hedonists well we know what their personality characteristics are because it's been studied narcissistic Psychopathic Machiavellian and that wasn't enough so after studying those three for seven or eight years the relevant psychologist added sadism because that's where it ends up and so you get you get this Unholy Dynamic of part of that is the inevitable dynamic between Hedonism and and force is that if you're going to Pro pursue short-term hedonistic ends then force will enter into I just rewatched Cabaret remember Cabaret oh sure it's so bloody brilliant because you see this Cabaret where where all the transexuals are by the way and Lisa Manelli who's the cluster be cluster be wannabe actress narcissist and they're they're Dancing Away madly having their hedonistic orgy and the Nazis are in the audience and it's so interesting Joel gray does a lovely job of this because the hedonists are they're in a dance with the Nazis you know and I think both of them know it yeah and we're doing the same thing we're doing the same thing now we are doing exactly the same thing I mean this is where I was headed to I mean this is this is tot this is how you get totalitarianism you know it's if you believe the if you read uh political ponerology this really interesting book on the psychology of totalitarianism he argues that totalitarianism is defined by the narcissists and the Psychopaths taking over every major institution in society and emerging from the bottom up the narcissist there's power is exercised I think in in those two ways the psychopath it's through raw power it's through a bullying being domineering trying to get people canceled trying to get people fired uh you know uh harassment the narcissists this is I'm borrowing from the ponerology book it's I think last name is pronounced lusi um he argues that the narcissists are spellbinders so they're casting a spell I mean speaking of the witch right there's a spell cast and so I I've been really we wrote I mean I think there's like a trance that has come over it comes over individuals it's cast by these really charismatic trans leaders and they sort of Mesmerize hypnotize put people in a sort of particular SED sedu yes definitely and then everybody their brain wave our brain waves get to some level or whatever and then anybody who veers outside of it and goes wait a second this doesn't seem right then they're there with the bully to to keep them in line and make an example of them and scapegoat them in order to to to create this culture of fear and Conformity so and we see it in the files I mean the files themselves are so chilling like if you were just a scholar of totalitarianism you know everybody's we spent so much time talking about you know those studies that were done in the ' 50s uh the electroshock studies or the prison Stanford experiments read these files you want to see what totalitarianism looks like somebody says hey maybe we should take a minute and think about whether or not to give drugs and surgery to somebody that has multiple personalities or that's been we we'll just get consent from each personality that's right the AL oh my God oh my God so then somebody goes maybe yeah why don't we take or why don't we have like a and why don't we actually maybe pause about or think about it and then there's somebody in the room in the chat room or the message board saying oh how dare you gatekeep how dare you create barriers to providing this health care just because they happen to have multiple personalities I mean it is so crazy you kind of can't even believe that it's actually happen like if you were to make a Hollywood movie out of the W path files you would I think you would be like this is not realistic like this would not be able to occur in today's society and yet here we are now you know firsthand why why the Germans didn't wake up in the late 1930s yeah it's because they couldn't believe it they literally couldn't now first of all they didn't want to believe it and they put their heads in the sand you know but it was it but but they also couldn't believe it there's no way there's no way that can be happening and you can understand why I I was there I mean I was there like I was there like a year or two ago being like this can't be true because if it were true then then we are something about it yeah or somebody would do something about it or yeah or or it would mean that we're living in a totalitarian Society already it would mean that the medical institutions that it's like a horror it's like that thing in the horror movie you get to the middle of the horror movie and you discover everybody's brain has been taken over by the aliens or there it's actually a secret brain swapping exercise there's some Horror in the middle of it and then you have to figure out how to get out of it you know which is I think what we're on to well okay okay so so let's let's approach that in two directions okay so now one of the things you pointed out so the manifestation of the narcissistic Psychopathic mellian sadist is different in men than women okay so in men it tends to be more get the hell out of my way or I will definitely hurt you like it's really in your face with women it's much more more subtle it's much more behind the scenes they're much more manipulative and the proclivity of the female antisocial type is to reputation Savage into gossip and now now there's a big so so tell me what you think about this so first first it's very difficult to fight against that so like women can't fight other women who do that it's very hard for them to do that but men also can't fight because the thing is if if I figure out that you're a psychopath and you're interacting with me and you're manipulating me I can actually punch you and that there's a high likelihood of that if you push it right and that's one of the things that regulates social interaction between men it's like don't push your luck not too far but that wave is barred 100% for women against women or virtually 100% And even more so against men and so men I I I believe that men have abdicated their responsibility to say no but there's I have a certain sympathy because for example I've had clients who were unfortunate enough to take up residence for example with a woman with cluster B Psychopathology and it was like their lives were over those women would light themselves on fire to singe them and they had no defenses and if they did ever raise a hand in defense of any sort then the cluster B type would call the authorities lie about what had happened invite a knight in shining armor to save her in tears which is really effective as she also happens to be attractive and that guy was done he was done his life was over right right yeah his little dried up corpse was being sucked dry by the by the psychopathic woman on the side of the road and that was it so so that's a big problem and so that's another I think go ahead no no sorry no I was going to say I mean I think since we it seems like we're turning a little bit to how do we handle this I mean I think the one one of the things that that the lusi describes in the ponerology book and of course it's just a theory because he couldn't prove it he live by the way he lived through Nazism and communism he opens the book describing a really lousy academic being appointed as the president of his university in Poland and the guy was just a psychopath like that's how he made it to that position and what lobi's argument is that could never happen Michael no I know you're reading it being like Oh I think we're there yeah no kidding we're definitely there we're definitely there so you kind of go on so he argues very persuasively I think that it's not enough to condemn it's not enough to say this gender mistreatment is is bad it's pseudoscience it's hurting people we should definitely do that but it's you have to actually do what you're doing I think and what I'm realizing I need to do which is you have to describe the Psychopathology quite specifically you have to describe it you must and so in that sense everybody says oh I don't want to get into the are the autog gyop files or whatever he under loi's view he says You must describe the psychopathologies of the leaders you must distinguish between the narcissists the Psychopaths the psychopathic narcissists you must Des I think he would probably go by extension you must just say these are autophiles these are not actually women these are people that think they're women and they get angry at you and the reason they're angry at you is because you deny their fantasy and you must deny their fantasy because their fantasy is driving such a huge amount of this and then you must also say to the people around them it's perfect narcissistic fantasy isn't it because they are literally in love with themselves like literally that's the fantasy is that my Alter Ego is the Perfect Mate they're so narcissistic that they transform themselves into their own sexual partner right there's you don't get any more narcissistic than that and you you think about that these guys who cross dress in their 40s and then they they have like three kids and then they decide to go full woman and it's like well I don't know if you notice buddy but you got a wife and kids this isn't about you anymore who gives a godamn about your sexual gratification like that what why does that inter well everyone should be able to do what they want it's like not how about not the narcissistic Psychopaths yeah well no exactly that's where I was going to go too I mean you may know there's you may know there's this evidence that certain kinds of pornography I don't really want to get into it but appear to be creating autophilia in men at younger ages and those are the men that are then entering women's sports with a sense of entitlement that they should be allowed to compete in their Sports because they insist that they're women so I think women even victimized women oppressed so much the better yeah oppressed the ultimate I'm the ultimate in an oppressed woman Plus I'm very sexually you know attractive what a deal you know yeah and and so so I think you have you have to describe that for what it is you have to be on you have to tell the truth again you come we come back to you know the key is actually telling the truth and then I think you also have to then look at everybody else and go you're behaving like a coward you have got to stop you're the head of the American Medical Association you're the head of the American they the head of the endocrine Society y be the head be the president of it which means you must have courage or step down yeah and allow try saying no you son of a yeah it has to be like we have I think we have to go inst unfortunately and it's going to take some time I don't think there's any substitute between going institution by institution in the society explaining what's going on challenging these leaders and the it's really simple American Medical Association you can you can end with stop with the pseudo science and cowardice or stop being respected by anybody as the American Medical Association those are your two choices like this can't continue I mean Jordan on the AMA website they still say that gender medicine prevents suicide that piece of pseudo science is still on the website despite multiple studies showing quite the opposite so I do think that that those are the for me I look at how do you get how does this end okay into okay so let's delve into that a bit more okay so there's a so this this has been infuriating me for quite a long time right like I knew I knew in 2016 when bill c16 came out in Canada that mandated pronoun use I went to the Senate and I said you are going to cause an epidemic among young women this is what's going to happen and the senators of course knew better and just you know asked me why I was such a mean man and why I was making such a mountain out of a mole hill right it's like well it's because I can see exactly what's going to happen and I can actually see why you're doing it you bloody virtue signalers right you Hypocrites we're so compassionate it's like oh I'll love my son no matter what and how am I going to demonstrate that well I'll castrate and mutilate him and turn him into a monster and I'll still love him that's how wonderful I am right Jesus man if it's no wonder people can't admit that that sort of thing exists because that's so godamn dark that it puts almost everything else to shame you just can't believe that could happen it happens right and and a fair bit right so there are plenty of mothers who hoist their child's severed body parts up on a flag to Signal their maternal virtue right brutal unbelievable unbelievable sacrifice that's for sure that's exactly what it is yes it's it's child sacrifice to the demon of Pride that's what it is and it's bad okay so so then I think well you know what do we do do we have like a truth and reconciliation like hugfest I don't think so I think that I think we put the people who've done this in prison I mean that like I think anybody who's transitioned a minor should be they they should lose their license this includes this includes the counselors they should lose their license and they should be put in prison there's no excuse for it and so I'm afraid that we have to change the laws first yeah you have to change the laws I mean you I mean I think if you go stepwise Jordan I would say let's go institution by institution and I mean medical Sports you know Riley G is trying to do that on the sports side Riley's doing yeah and she's going to succeed she's going to succeed I mean look I will say I think the public is really with us they're already with us and they don't even understand because I think most of a lot of the Public's in denial but I would say we got to go institution by institution then yeah the laws have to change I mean the Republican states in the United States are already changing we have to complete that and then we're going to have to go into the Democratic states and explain what's really going on and change the laws in those States I mean I think it's a lot harder for my liberal friends and family to justify this medical mistreatment when the National Health Service of Britain says that they're no longer going to do it I think it's a lot easier for them to because they're all partisan Democrats I think it's a lot easier for them to dismiss what's been happening in a Republican state because they're just so partisan but the British National Health Service is different you know the because they did it in they've done it in the Netherlands they've done it in Scandinavian countries right they've they pulled back quite quite and and the Netherlands example is particularly opo because that's where that Bloody Dutch so-called Dutch protocol of gender affirming care came from right so for the Dutch to reverse that and they're quite left leaning and so for them to reverse that well that it I understand it's not a sign a reversal as we saw in the UK right and the fact that the times actually wrote an article and published it was also you know definitely worthy of note right right but it's going to like the problem is is that the rot that's generating this thing the problem is again is that horrible as this is It's merely the wor it's the worst symptom of an underlying systemic problem and it's even hard to characterize this systemic problem well so here's part of a reflection of that you tell me what you think about this so the the Democrat the the the the demographic slice that's most supportive of the Democrats is childless women under 30 right right so but that's now forget the bloody politics we go down to the biolog psychological and the biological level like there's a reason for that like the the policies that the Democrats have devised which are variants of the victim victimizer narrative play very well into a misapplied maternal Instinct because the maternal instinct is find the infant and protect it it's like well I don't have an infant well do you have a dog no well I don't have a dog either well how about the oppressed oh yeah I've got the oppressed right exactly and so now the oppressed are infants they can do no wrong now all we have to do is find the oppressor this has turned out to be by the way quite hard on the Jews as we're seeing right right right right because if we're going to play oppressor oppression or or victimizer victim and we do that by classifying disproportionate representation in the upper strata of hierarchies as evidence of Oppression and victimization then the Jews win that contest right right well right and this is not much different by the way than what happened in Austria and in Nazi Germany this is a very old story like I I went through for example I went went through the story of exodus in great detail recently and the reason the Egyptians Enslaved the Jews is because they're disproportionately successful minority right so this been going on for a very long time yeah so what do you so it seems like if I I agree with your assessment so what do you think then how would you describe the way forward it seems like you have to find some secular way to affirm that everybody's Born Into the right body you know that there's biological differences that everybody has the right to puberty that nobody shall be denied the right to puberty but I think you're right denialism until we address it with some life affirming human of pro-human vision and I know you're you're I'm I'm a person of Faith you're a person of Faith but I I recognize also I'm in a secular society so I mean how do you answer the question of how do you make this case for a a a pro-human life affirming Vision in a society that's so secular I don't think there I don't think there is a secular uh reform okay I think I think I think we're at the end of the Enlightenment MH I think the secular experiment has collapsed I think it's collapsed because it's technically wrong I've the book I've just published or will publish in November the one I'm touring about is the book is we who wrestle with God and I make an elaborate case for this I think the evidence now this is the scientific evidence by the way the evidence is overwhelming that we see the world through a structure of value and the the description of a structure of the description of the structure of value of a person is a story that's what a story is so when you go to a movie and you watch someone characterized what you're seeing is the embodiment of their value structure and you want to see that because you need a value structure to orient yourself in the world that's what makes you pay attention to one thing rather than another because attention itself is value predicated and the monotheistic hypothesis is that all values unify at the Pinnacle and that people should Orient themselves towards that and I think that's I think there's every reason to assume that that's exactly right I also think it's Irreplaceable what do you say how do you so I we you and I have a lot of mutual friends that are that self self describe as atheists yeah our friend Steve Pinker I have you know uh a lot of my supporters are atheists Michael shurmer so there's obviously some and they're not nihilists right and they're very pragmatic and very sensible so do you just sort of think well there there are a minority of folks that that are not uh overwhelmed by the nihilism of life and they have a way to affirm it despite their atheism or do you feel like like what do you how do you how do you reconcile how are they managing it well I guess it's both it's it's not just a personal question I also think I'm asking a political question which is it seems like if we need to get a majority on our side on these issues um and you're in a in a secularizing society how do you how do you build those alliances yeah well I mean I don't have an answer for that I mean what I'm trying to do is to tell a better story and you know that has a certain impact and that's the right way to do it because I think the Right Way Forward is is always it's always Invitational the Right Way Forward is invitation and so if you can't tell a better story then you don't win the the contest what's the best story well look the leftest story is one of power right the look The postmodernists discovered that we see the world through a structure of value which is partly why they've been able to kind of scuttle the scientific Enterprise because raw empiricism doesn't work th this is partly why the enlight has to come to an endend you cannot Orient yourself with knowledge of the facts and the reason for that is that there's an infinite number of facts you have to organize the facts and as soon as you organize them you're in a value hierarchy so the postmodernists figured that out which is why and it's so interesting because most of them were literary critics right they were critics of story they knew there was something key to the story well the problem with the postmodernists wasn't that they they got that right and that was a major accomplishment but they leaped immediately to the Assumption because of their Marxism they leaped immediately to the assumption that the fundamental story was one of power mhm right and you can understand why that's an attractive story it's easy to understand you can understand every human dynamic in relationship to Power Plus when interpersonal Dynamics marriage business society when they become corrupt they do become corrupt in the direction of power so it's a powerful diagnostic observation but it's wrong so you might say well if the story isn't one of power what's the story and I know what the story is the story is one of the story is one of voluntary sacrifice that's the story and the Christian the Christian myth Mythos got that exactly right as far as I can tell and so the reason for that is that Community itself is a sacrificial operation to become a member of a community you sacrifice yourself that's what that's the definition of community now you might be able to sacrifice yourself in a manner that benefits you and everyone else right that would be the highest form of self-sacrifice that's what it that's what God calls Abraham to do when when God calls Abraham to Adventure he offers him a sacrificial path forward that would be optimally beneficial to him and to everyone else and so there's an equation in that story of the call to the adventure of sacrificial transformation and the simultaneous establishment of social harmony and I think that's right and and that's not power and I think the country that got that most right has being the United States right is that people have their responsibility it's it's it's they bear that responsibility that's a sacri they they work because work is sacrifice it's the sacrifice of the present to the Future so it's voluntary self-sacrifice is the right basis for community and the image of the crucifixion is that that's that's that's why it's in the on the altar that's why it's at the center of the church it's why the church is the center of the community that's all dramatized and it's right and it's the antithesis of the claim that power unites now what it means that that's right that Shades off into the ineffable like there's there's I don't know like I human beings are communal animals what does that mean metaphysically or theologically well you know that's where human knowledge meets its limit you you can't say in the final analysis and Jordan how do you how do you what's the difference so we so Jazz Jennings mom really sacri she sacrificed her son for something how is how is the what's the difference of yeah exactly so what is the difference between that sacrifice that they're M that they're doing they're sacrificing others for themselves I guess you would say rather than sacrificing part of themselves for others it's it's worse than that it's worse than that no first of all that's a very astute question and second you're not pessimistic enough in your in your analysis so because it's not that they're exactly sacrificing say their children to themselves it's that they're sacrificing their children to the narrowest of their whims and their demand and for prideful power right so it's a it's mythologically speaking it's a luciferian sacrifice right be then see because you might say Well they're gaining it's like wait a minute who are you talking about exactly it's not exactly obvious that JZ Jennings mother gained not in some comprehensive analysis I mean a more comprehensive analysis would mean that she couldn't have possibly failed on every front more spectacularly so what did she get out of it that that isn't the right question the right question is what did the worst impulses within her Garner from the situation right and so she subjected herself to her own narcissistic hedonistic whim and Allied herself with this Spirit of Pride and power right and then perform the requisite sacrifice and we're doing that everywhere it's brutal and the deeper you look into it the worse it it it it's no wonder people don't want to look you know there I mean that's not surprising yeah so the enlightenment is a is arguably a secularized version of the judeo-christian tradition that's the argument that Tom Holland makes and dominion and N made it others make it um is there a secularized version of the story you're describing that would appeal to our friend Steve Pinker and Michael shurmer we'll see how they respond to this book you know I think the answer to that is yes and the reason I think that is because I think that the intuition that that has possessed western civilization in many forms for thousands of years is that truth in its highest form is a unity and so I think we'll find that there's no distinction between the religious and the scientific Enterprise if they're both properly understood and I actually think I really believe this I think we're on that cusp I mean partly because for example the great neuroscientist that I've talked to over the last year I asked uh what's his name oh man now I'm gonna forget ter terrible yeah no it wasn't spolski although I did talk to spolski um he he he he he's developed an entropy theory of anxiety oh his name will come to me anyways he's the world's most cited neuroscientist at the moment and he's he's really quite the genius and I asked him this this is an odd question I said is every is every object perception a micro narrative and he said yes now you know it's not easy to understand what that means but what it means is that the sense data that the empiricists confused with the raw stuff of matter presents itself in its in its isolated elements as a story like uh a drinking glass is a prop in a play it's not an object MH right it's not a dead material object it's a prop in a play it has that's like a platonic ideal right it's it's very similar to the notion of platonic ideal and that means that what presents what presents itself to us in the form of apprehensible objects so that's the sense data they're all it's all micro narrative it's all within a coherent story or an incoherent story sometimes because you can be fragmented but there's no getting away from the story and the the the Great neuroscientists look this is this discovery has emerged in four different areas the AI people know it which is why they started training AI systems in a completely different way they're not rule based right they're value based and now they're very much like human beings because they were trained they were trained to identify value that's exactly how they were trained the robotics engineers figured this out the the psychologists who were studying perception figured this out and the postmodernist figured f it out so four different scientific disciplines simultaneously converged on the realization that even sense data presents itself as value you don't derive value from the underlying data that's wrong it's backwards and so so I would say this is another elaboration of that to some degree the biblical library is the repository of the value structure through which we see the world that's that's literally the case now you you could argue maybe that's for the worst it's like no I don't think so but you could make that argument but I don't think you can escape from that conclusion I I can't see how I've tried to escape from it I haven't been able to and so the but the idea is sort of I mean this is very I mean this is very profound stuff because I think if you kind of go yeah these we had the civilization that was oriented towards God as a source of value God dies people stop believing in God meaning come up power and sex arise as Al and we create and we and we turn our and we fantasize of ourselves as Gods yeah yeah now our our atheist and secular friends Michael Shermer and and and Steve Pinker if I were to try to channel them I think they would say I believe also in being in service to higher values they would say things like they would say things like family community rationality Enlightenment and so I guess one question is whether cuz I've been playing with this idea that really where we need to get we can build a a political majority to prevent these atrocities from continuing is around the idea of civilization but I think what you're saying is that that's not good enough that the civilization has to be in service of something even larger than the civilization itself look look look here's the problem with the perspective that Pinker and Shermer might adopt so let's say Family Justice truth beauty okay why why those well because they all they all share something they all share something good they all partake in the good okay this is a definition the good they partake in is God it's a definition so it's not the sum and botum exactly it's a it's a slightly different Twist on that it's that the the the ultimate unity of the spirit that is good is the good that makes it s manifest in all good things right and you see that's a different way of concep now Pinker and shurmer might say well that's not a spirit and you can't have a relationship with it right because that would be the next object okay there's a higher good but it's impersonal and you can't have a relationship with it I would say I think that's a demolish argument too because the fundamental mode of human apprehension is relationship like at the highest level of being we're a personality we exist in relationship so now you might say just because there's human beings doesn't mean there's a spirit with whom we can establish a relationship and the first thing I would say is that's not absolutely crystal clear so you know don't get the cart ahead of the horse but but I also think you can make a very credible case that the proper way of conceptualizing the manner in which we interact do and should interact with the highest good is in covenantal relationship I think that's how people do it I mean so and and I think that's the defining characteristic of the relationship between man and the Transcendent and so I I'll give you an example of that just a quick example so you know Pinker works well why well when he's working he's sacrificing the pleasures of the present for the future and maybe even for the community okay why well because he he because it's a contractual understanding his understanding is that he exists in relationship with something and if he makes the proper sacrifices there will be a commensurate return on that offering right that's so you see what happens in the biblical stories is that you get the idea of sacrifice established very early there's no difference between that and work and you might say that the spirit that guarantees the fruits of your labor is God that's another way of thinking these are definitions right this is the problem with the enlightenment mentality is that God was conceptualized first of all religion was conceptualized as a scientific theory which it isn't and then God was conceptualized as a cature of the ineffable and dismissed it's like no none of that's accurate none of that's it's not the right starting point it's the wrong mode of inquiry see see the the the Jews like the Greeks the Jews posited that at the highest level of value there was a Unity that's the monotheistic hypothesis and the alternative is well there's nothing well that's not helpful or that it's fragmented and that's also not helpful so you can't escape from the value hierarchy you can't escape from the problem of its potential unity and then you can have a debate about the characterization of that unity and that's useful but you're going to find out that the proper characterization is relationship you know so here's a way of thinking about it god let's say you have a loving relationship with your wife it's like well you you what you actually have is a relationship with what's high with the highest Spirit within her that's actually the way the relationship lays itself out if it's proper and the relationship is actually something Transcendent within you relating directly to something Transcendent within her and any genuine conversation is a manifestation of that as well and that that points to a a Transcendent reality right it's the reality that makes communication itself that's the logos man that's exactly what that is that's even how it's con calized right so and it's a it's it's not just our reality it's the reality upon which all other realities are predicated on including the scientific and and I I think I I think we're at a point where if you look very carefully at the converging evidence there is no other viable conclusion yeah I mean well Jordan I mean do you worry that that I mean you clearly don't think it's enough for there to be agreement on these core values and other words if you go family truth beauty progress you don't think that's enough you think there needs to be convergence on a higher value than those but don't you worry that that's going to reduce the size of your of your that's going to alienate allies and reduce the size of the Coalition that we need in order to resist totalitarianism I I think I think the problem with the fundamentalists and the conservatives is that they shake their stick and they hit the rocks with their rod to to make the water come forward right well that stops you from entering the promised land right so what's the way forwards you invite and no I think there's a way of formulating this story that is it's purely Invitational it's like and and the the proper offering would be this way of looking at things is so much richer than any of the Alternatives that like the problem is is you got to hoist your cross right you got to Bear your responsibility that's the price but I think that's an illusory price in some sense because you're going to sacrifice everything you have to something like that's the nature of life right you're you're going to exhaust your life in the service of something it might be a multitude of things so the the sacrificial part you you don't get to choose that you get to choose in service of what well they would say I think if you were to say I think we would have a broad a lot I mean I'm trying to I feel like I'm we we have to resist totalitarianism and so I'm trying to figure out how do you get to a majority I seems to me you know family truth beauty um you know care you know all these values that we have that they are they are where I think we can attract a lot of people I think we get to God faith and I think we start to lose people look we've been having that problem with the this Arc Enterprise right because we have six core domains that are very similar to the ones that you just laid out right core values right and we've been arguing back and forth consistently continually about how much you leave the Divine Unity that what is the source of those things so to speak implicit versus explicit and the answer is we don't know right we don't know and but but we certainly I certainly do understand I believe that you don't insist upon it or use Force that's where you get the totalitarian alliance between the religious spirit so to speak and and and the totalitarian state that's the sort of things that people like Dawkins object to right and and rightly so but but look like well one example see I don't know how anybody can dispute the idea that the ground of community is sacrifice is self-sacrifice like that's right I mean obviously when you mature you give up the narrow whims of a hedonistic 2-year-old for the broader right so okay so then you might I think we would get I think you would get Pinker and I'm I mean I I don't know but I think we would get Pinker and shurmer on that um well then you might ask well then you'd say well okay okay let's let's just sake for the sake of argument that that's the case well then you might ask yourself as a as a historian or even as a biologist imagine that human beings came to that explicit realization at least in part that the core to to to the etal Community is voluntary self-sacrifice okay how best should that be represented so it was memorable at hand for everyone regardless of intellect and transmissible down the generations I'd say well you didn't code it in a story right and then you might say well is that story true and the right answer to that is it depends on what you mean by true right because you don't get to play see that's the thing is at the level of religious inquiry you don't get to play that game anymore because when you say does God exist let's say the right rejoinder is what's your definition of exist oh well that's obvious it's like no that's where your unconscious religious presuppositions are making themselves manifest and so your question is really I'm a materialist and I believe that t that there are tables is God a table it's like okay have it your way no God's not a table are you s isfied well you know what kind of useful discussion is that that's not useful it goes nowhere it's just it's completely the wrong level of it's like what color is a musical note it's not help that's not a helpful question and this is why I think we're at the end of the Enlightenment because the the dichotomy between rationality and the religious is it's a false dichotomy we got it conceptualized wrong we didn't understand was something we didn't understand something profound and I'm very interested in seeing what you know I brought some of these ideas forward to some of the more atheistic types the enlightenment types that I talk to you know and sometimes I'll hit a sticking point where I just can't discuss the ideas any further but generally as long as I proceed on the scientific side there's there's no dispute at all right there's going to be some more bitter pills to swallow I'm afraid but that's life well you've helped me I think this is very interesting because I've been playing with how do you create some framework that you can build a proper majority to resist the totalitarianism or overcome it and I've been coming to a lot of you know an affirmation of the human if you're pro-human then you're pro- civilization if you're Pro civilization you need cheap energy Law and Order meritocracy if you want that Civilization to be liberal Democratic then you need free speech free and fair elections and equal justice under the law I I'm not sure where the gender medicine one fits into that I've been playing with that because I can kind of come up with six core pillars of liberal Democratic civilization I'm not sure any of those six actually protect kids and vulnerable adults in the ways that they clearly need to be protected from the be fruitful and multiply is not a bad not a bad axum there is no civilization if you don't have if you don't protect puberty and protect the right of people to grow up well there's also a reason there's also a reason reason that the image of mother and child is sacred and it wasn't just sacred to the Christians right I mean it there there are images of of Isis and Horus dating back to Egyptian times that are essentially indistinguishable from Mary and Christ the same idea was being put forward and the reason for that is that if the image of mother and child is not sacred then Society decays what you get you're going to have the Virgin Mary you're either going to have the Virgin Mary and the infant Christ or you're have the whr of Babylon those are your options right right right and we've got plenty whr of Babylon right plenty of it and more all the time right uh more than a mouthful you might say right more than a surfite yes I think this is great because you actually given me the seventh pillar of civilization which is really the right to continue the human the obligation even the obligation yeah the obligation right that's s well that's even you know people say well why should I bring a child into a world such as this it's like well that's your sacrificial Duty you know the world will tear my child apart it's like yeah that's right that's exactly right you know that's that's what so there's this that there's a statue in St Peters of the peda right which is Mary with her broken son in her arms well that's motherhood like that's not the infant anymore it's like yes your child will be broken by the world right right definitely well do you make that a sacred necessity well that's what that's Mary's decision her decision is I have faith in this I have faith in the central structure of being in becoming I will bring a child into the world right with all its horror you know and then I'll launch him so that he can pursue his Redemptive Mission which is what you do to a child if you love them it's like go out there and like pick up the challenges man push yourself out against the world right and so the the freudians knew this they said this a century ago The Good Mother fails what was the alternative what was the mother that they advocated mother devouring mother oh right The Good Mother fails yeah brutal that's the sacrificial gesture of the Eternal feminine that's what it is yeah and that's it's a sacred image because there's no replacement for it right right you know so look maybe I'll send you a copy of this manuscript and you can I can't wait to read it Jordan I'm delighted kick the hell out of it if you can because I've been like trying to break it apart with hammer and tongs you know and I'm not putting forward any argument that I can that I can break so well I I think we're in a real emergency at this point I mean I I feel that you know that you look at what's happening and you see basic attack on human development in the form of Jud gender pseudo science and medical mistreatment an attack on our Energy Systems in the form of malthusian anti-humanism And a ba and a basic you know war on on meritocracy on on Law and Order on the on the basis of civilization so it's it's coming a lot faster and a lot more powerful than I think many of well I think that's also Michael I think that's why the archetypal structures are becoming obvious because it's happening so fast that the lines are be are becoming Starker right this has always happened this has always been happening but it's happening way faster now right and so it's like oh you can see the metaphysical characters behind the scenes right much more clearly yeah yeah and it's not a pretty picture and this is why people turn away and I can understand but but that it's not look when when the Israelites get all clamor in the desert for the last time in the story of Exodus they're all bitching and whining because oh they're not in the lovely tyranny and all they have to eat is Mana it's like it's it's real rough and they run out of water so they go to Moses and and squawk about it and and uh they're complaining and clamoring away and God gets sick of them and so he sends a bunch of poisonous snakes in there to bite them this is the sort of thing that God does that makes people like Dawkins hate him right it's like what sort of God would throw in the snakes it's like lose faith and see how many snakes appear there boys and girls so anyways in come the snakes and the Israelites repent because of the snakes and uh they ask Moses to go to God and call them off and Moses said okay and so he has a chat with God and he says you know do you want to call off the snakes and God says yeah I don't think so but I'll I'll make you a different deal you make a Brazen serpent make a pole and put the serpent on it and uh get everybody to come and look at it and if they look at it if they look at what's poisonous they'll be immune from it right that's the symbol of aus by the way right the universal physician right so what's the antidote to pathology and and and totalitarianism it's like and and despair it's like look upon that which poisons you right in faith yes right right exactly exactly right man that is right in I was R I was reading uh even book medical Nemesis which is about iatrogenesis the way the medical system makes people sick and he really makes a big point of stop looking to the medical stop looking to fix the medical system so that it stops poisoning you you have to build the internal resources the internal ability to withstand the pain and suffering that is Life okay okay that's the only that's the only solution to it well let's let's close this with this so one of the things we talked about right at the beginning was your initial resistance to even delve into this domain and you said why it's like who wants to look at that and the answer is no one but you did so let's let's ask two questions then why did you like what drove you to do that and to overcome your resistance and what has been the consequence for you right because that's the end of the story you looked on the snake that no one wants to look at and it's certainly poisonous so the question is you know why what drove you to do that what voice did you hearken to that in invited you on that Adventure let's say and then what's the consequence for you of doing this it's such a great question Jordan I mean it's so funny because when you say what was the I had this call to do something on it that I refused I mean you I saw it happening and I refused the call and then of course it was you know in the classic heroes Journey narrative I finally felt compelled because this per this person or persons who gave me the files I knew that nobody else would be able to bring them into the world in the way that we could do it you may know that we wrote a we wrote A or I didn't write I had my my colleagues wrote a 70-page report to accompany the files we had attempted to do it journalistically it was too much too complex so we spent eight months working on this report the consequences I'm afraid that they're they're only starting I mean I've never look I've been I've been taken on the CIA the FBI been writing about Jeffrey Epstein none of it worries me none of none of that scared me the these people and look I'm not not so scared of them but I'm I'm also I think the people that are involved in this which is frankly uh cult a child sacrifice en castration cult we're just being perfectly honest like that's what as an objective description of it they they're they're very dangerous they're violent they're aggressive they attack so I've taken my own personal security I won't say what but I'm taking measures to protect my personal security at this point not not for a minute no why not why not because that's surprising like you know you just said there's the most dangerous opponent that you've probably faced and I believe that by the way I I I believe that's to be the case yes and and a very well organized one too the only YouTube videos I've had taken down have being the ones that touched on the transition right right well we'll see if this one we'll see what happens with this one yeah yeah yeah exactly we will see we we will see okay so you're putting yourself in danger so why don't you regret it well this is it it comes back to this thing we were just talking about right it's like it's like if you're not going to take some amount and I don't want to overstate it either but if you're not going to be willing to take on some amount of sacrifice on something like this then what good are you like what is the point you're not really a man right you're not really a father you're just not a like I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I had said no to this and you're the slave of psychopaths that's what you are that's right that's right would be voiceless braing slave of psychopaths that's right right that's exactly and now I can in a position where like U we're not going to be afraid of them we're going to overcome them and we're going to figure out how to do that I have a lot of I do have faith I think I am I do tend towards optimism um so but I think this is this part Jordan is such a helpful conversation because I do think being able to describe what's happening in very specific psychological terms I think is one of the keys to overcoming the totalitarianism that we're facing at different at different places in different parts of society simultaneously y yep definitely well you got to get the diagnosis right before you can prescribe The Cure right that's right right yep yep all right man well it's going to be a crazy year buckle up yes yep yeah well congratulations man good work thank you Jordan thank you for uh thank you for the conversation I always learn so much when I talk to you yeah yeah it was great to talk to you man all right so for everybody watching and listening well that was a trip I I think you might agree with that thank you very much for your time and attention and uh you know there's plenty to digest in that thank you to the Daily wire for facilitating this conversation and the film crew here in Savannah that's where I am today um and all of you who are watching many of you know know I'm going to talk to Michael for another half an hour on the daily wire side not exactly sure where we'll go with that but um join us and throw some support their way because they're what's allowing these sorts of conversations to move forward and so thanks Michael very interesting thank you Jordan thanks for having [Music] me
