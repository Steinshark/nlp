there's no other way to say it the world is divided on nfts and it's not an easy 50 50 split it's not a cut down the center like north and south korea it's more like a 90 10 thing where most people don't understand nfds or think they're way overvalued and you have the 10 percent who'd rather have a board ape yacht club than have an actual yacht club right now the war is pretty even you got the 10 believers all on twitter screaming every day while the 90 are more like cool jpeg bro but recently the battle has been heating up as the icon of american culture keanu reeves weighed in he was asked about an nft collection coming up with matrix resurrection and he didn't hold back his opinions let's just say that bring down the board i get into it dodge it dude i haven't hit my head in years dude years all right let's watch they made uh nfts for the new movie and there were like 100 000 of them and the site broke like in the first few hours because there were over 300 000 people in the queue trying to buy these nfts for 50 and so like when you think about the concept of digital scarcity and things that are you know they can't be copied that are easily reproduced well but they're not the same right oh boy that's painful on the one hand you got you got the reporter being like well they're not the same right right i just spent a lot of money on those i think it's just cackling like he's trying out for the lion king hyena role but they're not the same right and you know what i'm gonna say this right now i think the nft nft bros deserve it a little bit yeah i'm gonna say it i know it's a controversial take i know i'm gonna get in trouble but hey you guys have had this coming a little bit now look you guys know i love the part of nfts that's like let's get digital artist spade okay great that's that's cool but right now it feels like the nft market's more like about getting derivative cash grabs you know what i mean like it's not about art as much as it is exploiting artists and getting them hiring a bunch of kids on fiverr to go make you know 10 000 profile pics so you can profit here's the thing you're gonna get hate if you do that it's and so i feel like it's not everybody's fault in the nft community there's obviously a lot of great people and i'm sure it's the idiots getting the most attention which is unfortunate but those people are poisoning the well for everybody else because it just feels like everybody's got an nft collection right now and it just turns it into something that's really not special it's kind of stupid it literally feels like people are jumping into nfts just so they can prove they're like ahead of the curve or whatever and you know what i have a proposal to fix this um because i don't want nfts to get ruined i propose that only actual artists can sell art in fts from now on no hey listen and i know that sounds like i'm gatekeeping who am i to say who can post an nft but um okay you're right it does sound pretty gatekeepy uh maybe this if you're a marketer if you're if you know who i'm talking about um the guys who watch garyvee all day yeah those guys can't have an open c account i feel like that would fix all this somehow and you know it's weird right because it feels like this just all started as let's help the artists whatever and then it's you know it's a bunch of influencers trying to tell you you're going to get rich and you're not and this is the part i really want to hit on right my petition to ban banned marketers from open c look the reason is is because they're only in in it for one reason and that's they don't care about the tack right they don't care about art what they care about is money right they care about all the money in it it's the same reason that kickstarter uh actually just joined the blockchain i don't know if you guys saw this they decided they're suddenly into it the reason being it seems to me because you know people like the constitution dao those guys who are trying to buy the constitution they raised more money just by themselves no crowdfunding platform in one go than kickstarter has ever raised for anything so obviously kickstarter saw this and we're like all right well i guess i guess we're in the blockchain business now and it feels like that's happening a lot people have noticed how much money is in nfts and everyone's just flocking into that industry whether or not they fit and that's the thing that uh is kind of annoying i mean look not everybody needs an nft collection like if you're a mailman you might not need an nft collection and you're thinking oh that's a joke no i mean look dude beverage companies are jumping in we're one step away from ups doing it too look at this at least actually it would make more sense drops i mean look at this budverse nft giveaway what is that pepsi same thing they just dropped the pepsi mic drop i mean have these guys forgotten that they serve beverages that's what you do we're in the middle of a pandemic they're supply chain shortages and what are they worried about their nft drops going well yeah guys that's that's the most important thing in fact pepsi's isn't going so well um they had a bunch of bots immediately snipe snipe their their mint or their white list and so now they're they're working to make sure that only humans get it so that's where our attention is going that's where our time's going i mean you know it's just stupid that's that's what i guess what i'm saying is like okay is keanu reeves you know right to just dismiss the whole industry and laugh at it well but they're not the same right a little bit it is funny it i i get it so i feel like we're reaching just sort of peak insanity with nfts and for someone to come out and just sort of laugh at the whole thing and be like wait what are we so into i really do think it's funny and maybe a little bit deserved um even though the tech is cool and you know i love artists actual artists getting their bag you know i i don't really care to see gary v make another you know billion dollars that's not really my dream right but either way when people end up coming up with some more actual use cases for nfts i'll be singing your praises but for now i'm just gonna laugh along with keanu cause it's pretty funny all right that's basically it i'll see you in the next one
