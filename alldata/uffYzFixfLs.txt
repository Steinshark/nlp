hi and welcome to this week's amazing breakfast blog Pro highlight um it is block roll 350 today so I've been doing this for quite some years you know if you do the math in your head it should be about seven years now there are some breaks in there and if you look at Jason Turner's weekly which also is you know a weekly um he is at 345. but he's trying to actually have every week or weekly so sometimes I skip or I have skipped when I was traveling uh the spark road so um I guess by next year on two years will be like equal in numbers or at some time he takes the lead versus weekly which is definitely a big uh achievement you know to to do that over those years so I'm the same kind of happy that you know we've been able to provide that to you um or I've been able to provide that to you with uh the block roll and most of the block rules contain his video too in the video section which is below but let's go into the slides to actually show you this week's block roll highlight it is the first article this week there are many articles this week but the first one is special it is from Secret Stories the block from bartek um and it is about all major C plus plus 17 features you should know okay and that is the deal in this article you get at the start um a listing of what he covers in this blog post and it is a lot as you see okay so this is a long block article um you may not have to read completely maybe it is a great thing to scroll through and see the things you knew about or things which are new to you and which are may or may not be available to you on your compiler if you use the current version of a compiler an updated version which is like from this year all of that should be available to you okay um and as an example the article starts with the feature for a language feature on New Order rules for direct initialization and you you get a link to the paper you get to see from which compiler version this has been um implemented and a bit of a description an example of what it is about and for every feature basically which is listed in the overview in the beginning and the best thing that's quite a long article it's quite an awesome thing to do so thank you for that and it has been a very very popular article because of that this week um also because you know C plus 17 is available to most of us right it's not like C plus 20 which is often uh in implementation phase for many features and a handful of features are you know available to everyone and there's more features which are available if you have the US version of your compiler but C plus 20 is something which we are getting excited about but C plus plus 17 is the widely available standard for the community and I was like wait a minute language and Library features the source is also something I have in my survey and I have a question about the usage of language and Library features and this is a library of the language version um which in the survey has been running since the early days of 2020 um and you see there's a preside for people not using it and then there's just you know others other features which I couldn't put into the survey question because of you know space things um and then there's the 0.17 features for the language which are in the survey which is nested namespace definitions new attributes fall through maybe unused and notice code expressions for variated templates if constant expression structured bindings initialize Us in if and switch so seat head for Constructors inline variables and has improved and from these structured bindings is the most popular followed by a constant expression it's not a big surprise that it is the case um third place is nested namespace definitions which also is a great thing to use and I guess many people use this without even knowing which standard it is from if it's available in their compiler because such a thing feels so natural right um and yeah the third place is the new attributes was notice guard and fourth through and very unused I guess notice cart is the one which most people use and have a question on attributes but haven't included it here um and the same question but for Library features for C plus 17 I thought I also covered this um enhance it here again not using C plus 17 and other as a start then it's any byte file system Mass special functions optional parallel algorithm string view try and place or insert or in sign for map and unordered map uncaught exceptions uniform container access and variant so from these not very surprising optional takes the lead that's very very useful as a type and it's good to use it in apis so then second place string view also no big surprise very very useful for many many people using strings as a popular thing it's almost everyone right um third place is file system which also is new with C plus 17 and very very useful for everyone and variant um if you already used variant you may already have variant available to you through a library and then you might not use the standard version so I find it a bit surprising that it is on fourth place and that it's so tied to file system but of course when you're able to use it in the standard you might have uh the option to use it and maybe it's available to many people which before that did not use variant because it was a model of programming they were not used to it's also an option to explain this um and yeah if you're interested in survey questions and the I have those questions for all standards from C plus 11. um go there and take the survey and look at the results which brings me back to the zipper for 17 article from bartek um this is a really great block and it's one of the most active blocks we have the CPP stories um which he writes every week in article Tunes as active as a runner Grim's block um and yeah just go there re read this article and it's it's a great featured article actually for this week um and then there are other articles I could highlight um I wrote an article about my conference what you can expect for the conference which is in the month um may just you know if you plan to come to build and get your ticket early um that helps us with planning and helps you to have a ticket because we probably sell out at some point um more on that probably next week um I wrote a blog post about it a few interest and then you know read it um Conan has a lot of uh stuff to cover this year they have a new release for Conan 2-0 and they broke about it and then they have an interesting article about clang on Windows uh sea lion has two articles um C plus plus now has released this videos um Lee Meyer I think the number of comparisons needed to sort a shuffled array q-sword versus sdd so it is an interesting read the cute block again has a lot of things to cover uh cute Creator 9 is released in beta programs or something you want to look at and if you're teaching cute house now educational licenses for students and teachers um and what I don't show here currently I might add that to the videos in the future below the block roll our videos um as I mentioned Jason Turner's videos every weekend there because he has a weekly and as every week we're swatching so I included every week and then there's other videos my videos like this video will be in next weeks and um other videos you find there so if you um want to read something about C plus plus this week this is what I you know have seen through my RSS tooling that's what this is based on um and for everything right now thank you for attention and see you next week
