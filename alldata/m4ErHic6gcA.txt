what was your first experience of the internet first experience of the internet doing me any good actually didn't come properly you know until 1984 with emo and you're talking 1969 so in the meantime it was that it was just for a small select few i think i've had the internet since i was a baby because my dad was always into it we started with a 56k modem and so that took a long time to connect a lot of beeps i used to be able to hum it back exactly i don't think i'd do it i could do it now um no no didn't you did you no no it was 15 years before i saw any benefit from that so-called breakthrough yeah what was that benefit just it was email so the first thing i remember was in 1984 when i was a phd student at the university of sheffield and we were connected to the janet net for the first time and we got access to email so a group of five or six of us gathered around the terminal and sent an email to edinburgh to andrew blake who was recently the director of the touring institute and we sent him an email that said hello andrew we then waited three days for it to arrive and we had to keep bringing him up to find out when it had got there but it did get there i remember using old computers that were next networked up in my primary school they were like bbc computers and we were doing some nomad game and that was networked at least whether it was online i'm not sure i think mostly it was web access and i was building websites fairly young at 15 which was fun to do but um yeah just slow loading noisy internets as i remember one of my first memories i guess is sitting in an internet cafe in cambridge a number of years ago with a one of the first web browsers so was it i won't say like netscape or something like this and opening up the web browser and actually seeing web pages for like the first time really um that was probably my one of my first memories i this must have been i'd 25 years ago so you know not a long time ago but yeah a while ago so i was in university of technical university of berlin and we had yeah we had the first um connection to arpanet or whatever it was at the time and um so what i was doing yes i i was i was subscribed to the uh to the anarchy mailing list which was pretty pretty interesting so my dad worked at bt uh during the 90s so he was involved with like really helping roll the internet out so it was quite cutting edge in our house and i remember we had dial up and having to hang up the phone every time we wanted to use the internet i used to drive my mum's spare because she'd want us to get off in case somebody called well one of the first times i went online i started reading frac which is a uh an ascii only digital magic magazine about how to hack telephones in particular and and how to get free onto the onto the internet system and yeah i just thought it was fantastic so for me i think it was going around my friend allen's house and uh going on bulletin board systems to arrange games of doom 2. so that was probably what the early 90s 94 85 something like that and then coming home and learning about apple's e-world which was a whole new world for you i was really excited thought it's going to be gooeys now isn't it you're going to have like a picture of your town and you go to your little email area and it was not like that it was really bad or this whole community of people who are trying to understand this a system that was still being developed and it was sort of like an active race of people trying to figure out how it works and how you can subvert it it was took forever because the telcos vested interests got in the way they wanted to run the world and they had to be told firmly that it wasn't just them so yes of course if you were to ask me uh how if it took that long to get to email how long did it take from the 1969 to get to the world wide web and browsers everywhere well 1994 it took 25 years for it to get beneficial enough that people could casually visit other sites and see web pages and stuff quite amazing i don't actually remember the first time i got on the internet um it probably would have been at school i would think um we did eventually get america online but i think i would have seen it first at school i sort of remember search engines coming out i remember you know the early days of searching for things um and sort of being excited by that uh and also curious you know i remember contributing to the open directory something like that i remember like about being like an independent yahoo directory equivalent i remember sort of adding sites to that and sort of you know playing my part in like you know as a very young child contributing to what i thought was going to be the future of how people find things yeah it was a really long time ago when i was using one of those all more than uh 28 kilobytes that took like two minutes to connect and then my father was saying what the hell is that noise that you have when you take the phone um i think it was like back in spain something called terra.s that then collapsed at some point uh i was pretty fun actually but that's the only uh search engine that we had at the time and you couldn't do much with it to be honest yeah but that's quite quite fun at the time we got an amazing three kilobytes per second download you know so that was maybe a you know if you were downloading an mp3 that would be you know quite a while it would take as opposed to fractions of a second you had the phone cable that i was dragging through the whole house and you'd have to ask the parents because it was like oh there was still i'm from luxembourg so we still had a different currency and it cost like you know five francs per minute to use the internet and grandma couldn't call yes the good old days i do remember that as soon as i understood what the internet was and how it worked i immediately started trying to make my own website um which i did was terrible uh but that's my my my early memories of the internet are like trying to write html in all caps in notepad it was a simpler time i was thinking last night about bulletin boards and the fact that actually with social media we're just going back to doing exactly the same things now it's great you know we're just posting stuff for people to see it's the same stuff the first stuff i remember i suppose is listening to a modem dial up to connect to web pages not there were that many web pages then but the ones that did exist seem to be absolutely loaded with blinking flashing banners saying under construction and garish cyan fonts as a nightmare first memory of using the internet was in 1994 my brother just got back from university and had found out about the internet and so when we had to have it at home and so we bought a 28 8 us robotics modem for our acorn archimedes a3000 which was the family computer you couldn't do much web browsing at the time because the a3000 wasn't much good at it so i spent a lot of time on telnet chat rooms so they were called talkers at the time uh it was a bit like a bbs you could log on and talk to people on in kind of a terminal interface um so i spent hours on that and then it all came crashing down when after a month of having that we got the phone bill uh which was for about 150 pounds basically all of me all for my dial-up internet talking uh and from then on i was limited to half an hour a day on the internet when i started using the internet i i was doing my master's uh studies so and it was back in my country of aryan origin in in mexico in a city called chihuahua like the dock felt pretty exciting you know i guess that's probably one of the reasons i went into computer science is you kind of saw this massive opportunity of you know all this suddenly all this stuff's available and there's things we can do with it and yeah let's try and avoid some of the more visually unappealing fonts but there's things we can do with the internet right i've never got any better at that by the way websites were a lot simpler back then so i remember the start of google it looked kind of the same but you know different font and stuff it was obviously not quite the juggernaut it is now um and and then just fun websites like hamsterdance.com i don't know if you remember this no um so animated uh gifts were a big thing back in the uh late 90s uh i mean gifts are coming back a bit actually but i just want to say that you know we we started this you know we are my generation started the animated gif in a big way uh so hamsterdam.com i went on the way back machine the internet archive and found it and this is hamsterdance.com it had fun music yeah it had lots of animated hamster gifs it serves no purpose at all oh that's still what the internet's for actually serving very little purpose but you know back then they took it to a different level uh so yeah hamsterdance.com and other animated gif related nonsense can we put year on this roughly well this i'm looking here at two thousand but i would say 1999 2000 some for somewhere around that we we you didn't start i mean facebook didn't exist until 2004. so this was before that websites were if you look down websites were mostly text hit counters at the bottom of websites were a big deal right we you know people wanted you to know that a thousand people have been to their website yeah exactly it's just like that it's just like that if you look the oldest houston manager the messages about me is that i had a motorbike accident in 1980 something 81 or something 82 i don't know and the first big embarrassment i i had for a company i developed a passer generator and common lisp and then somebody asked the interest in the code and i was going to send it to him and then i sent it to the mailing list and and i wasn't supposed to do this and then he he told me oh this uh your code is now already in texas and where else and i said i just i just posted the code which i've written for this company on the on the internet so that was one of my first embarrassments in misusing the internet yeah so i think the first time i really remember going online was probably at primary school um and we used to have some math lessons in the computer room where we get to play maths games very educational online um [Applause] [Music] forgot about that um i remember asking my dad like multiple times how do i spell google um i can never remember and before google i remember sort of typing in howtoprogram.com and other things.com in the hope that it would find you know something interesting but but actually website's loaded nice and quickly even on a 56k modem because there's really only about five images and some text on here so you know maybe it wasn't so bad i think all my friends at primary school had email addresses by the final year and we'd be emailing each other after school i lived in a house with 11 guys 11 students and for quite a long time and i built our own server that allowed everybody to you know use the internet through it and and actually we first used a coaxial cable it was an end-to-end cable but then at some point we moved to ethernet but i was amazed how at that time all passwords were just sent on plain text because i wrote the server i could drop all the packets and i could sniff all the passwords and you know and people didn't believe me that that that was done and i just showed one of my one of my student friends like look is that your password he said damn yeah i got it what sort of era is this is we in the 90s so so i started going online in 1995 so that was very early so it was things like gopher and telnet and and arcane library methods there there was no internet search yet at that time we had aol in our house and we were it was that annoying noise was dialing in and get like three stages across and a little aol person would move along and then um yeah and then every web page would be like loading got a bit of a picture that's yeah that seems to be my early memories i think when i first started using the internet we didn't use the web that much the atari wasn't up to it particularly before i got actual tcp connectivity one of the things we did was we emailed people and i can remember that i was a big fan of babylon 5. still am and at that time the writer joe michael straczynski had his email address public and i remember emailing him with questions about things in the show and he would respond so that was great you sort of emailing the people who are creating things well my first memories of going online i was in a student house in the early 90s and a friend of mine bought a 14 400 modem and he had somehow come up well discovered some phone numbers for bbs's bulletin board systems i think it was bulletin board system anyway bbs is where you could go onto a bulletin board and leave posts or read things or download things from them and this bbs would allow them you to have a certain amount of internet time through their system so that was my first memory of going online we sent a few emails we looked at a few things and i suppose it went from there fifty years of the internet this week phil what's your memories of the internet unfortunately i'm now nearly 52 and my memory is much depleted and deteriorated compared to what it used to be i can't really remember it's it's ridiculous i can't remember sending a first email um i certainly i was at university between 1985 1990 for undergraduate degree and i certainly remember mucking around with the mainframes from looking around with the waxes and and playing around but i can't remember sending an email what i can vividly remember however is going to a synchrotron which is a particle accelerator we condensed matter physicists aren't so much interested in the particles we're interested in the light those particles give off and that was in a place called daresbury which is uh pretty well equidistant between liverpool and manchester right in the middle of liverpool and manchester and i remember going there to do an experiment and sending an excited email back saying you won't believe it they've got a browser here and you can actually see images on it it downloads images and puts it without any sort of ftp stuff and that's my overriding memory getting so excited of a browser it was netscape or not script as i used to call it um that brought up the images and i remember sort of that type of thing that's my overriding memory and of course dial up but everybody says dial up i'm sure i had an amiga computer right this is like an amiga 500 or 1200 i can't remember and i remember spending hours downloading the uh debian 2.0 distribution from the internet uh this is probably you know it's probably like 50 60 megabytes or something like that hours and hours downloading it so i can install it because i'd heard about this linux thing i was interested in it and so i i so i was downloading these packages and packages and like gradually sort of installing it on my on my amiga and that's sort of one of the earliest things i remember i also remember again sort of going on download demos so you know people would write these kind of demos for the amiga pushing the hardware to the limit and you know this is like two or three megabytes and you know it's like hours of downloading just to kind of watch this demo because you used to have to get that stuff from public domain disks so you'd send some money through the post and say i want these disks and you'd get these disks back in the post and so being able to do that via the internet was a kind of completely different experience but you know obviously it took a really really long time i remember emailing a friend who was in australia on a gap year and they were on a university system over there assuming that we'd be doing backwards and forward emails so they this email popped up and they sent a reply and thought we'd be back on it but we didn't go along online again for a couple of days so um yeah it was it was definitely in its infancy that sort of system for us as consumers at home even though the internet was obviously whatever it already was 20 years old or whatever it was already i also remember actually with going back to the amiga again spending hours trying to configure uh something called ami ttp which is like a ttp stack for the amiga um and it was really you know i had no experience of using these sorts of uh bit software like you know networking software so i was spending hours trying to configure it just to get online and i completely failed and i think we ended up buying some kind of some other tcp stack software first time i saw the internet was when i was at work and they brought in this computer and plugged their modem in and went this is a great new thing the internet we went to the search thing and it brought back hardly any results because there was nothing on there so we kind of went come back to us when there's actually things on there a couple of years after that i got an email address and started it was actually a good communication tool and things started appearing on the web and it started actually being practical then so but until then we'd use janet at university but it wasn't didn't really have internet connectivity all you could do was talk to students and academics so my first memory of the internet is this ability to see text images from you know other places on earth i wasn't there but i could read what other people were saying and thinking that was fantastic first electronic communications through the chat uh programs at the time if i recall correctly there was something called i rc shot to be honest i don't get it i can but yeah so i don't remember the chat thin programs that will allow you to you know talk to people that you haven't met before and that was strange but very interesting feeling really the first things i can remember which can't be the first things but it's like um using irc uh using things like the undernet and using ftp servers this type of thing and i remember we did very early on we did an oecd project that looked at the use of digital technology and the internet for education so we started communicating and chatting via irc chat rooms etc we were in the mass building which is what we are today and we didn't actually have a connection to the outside world but psychology did so you could connect across to psychology's computer and dial up london log into one of london's nodes and then you could use the internet very very slow and of course it was going across satellite so you connect to i don't know there weren't very many sites but there were a few places you could pick up software so you'd log into those but because it was going over a satellite you typed like letter a and it would take about three seconds for the a to come back and so you start typing and then you get very confused halfway through and have to delete it all and this is all painfully slow but we thought it was wonderful at the time first time i used it for my own benefit was trying to contact alan guth in in he was at mit he still is one of the most famous cosmologists alive came up with the idea of inflation and i wanted to visit the us i was a i was at imperial and we used to have to go up a corridor there was the only computers where there were three three computers up at the end of the corridor and we'd have to go to this really dark room and the computers were green little symbols going across them that was the font style and you'd type in your message and very and then send it and you'd hear it go ping and each of the destinations it was it was as if it was being carried each line was pinging pinging pinging and then eventually it pinged allen.guth at mit and it said message received and i thought oh wow this is the first time and then you have to wait about a day or two days and then i kept going back and got nothing and then one day he said yeah come along come on bro so i went over to her with the us i saw alan guth i saw chandrasekhar who won the nobel prize so i i raised a tour i went to chicago i went to mit i went to berkeley and it was great the internet the internet rules our lives another lecturer called hugh smith and he had contacts with ucl and so we got into this sort of internet and arpanet and early connections to that and i started working on email software to try and make sense of all this stuff that was going on get rid of all these exclamation marks
