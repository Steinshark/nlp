this is all about triangles it's about triangular numbers so a triangular number is a number that I could make into a triangle if I use these tokens so something like a three would be a triangular number cuz I can make a little triangle out of it or I could have a number like six cuz six tokens Can Make a little triangle as well or I could have the number 10 because 10 tokens like this would make a triangle as well 15 would be the next one and 21 is the next one I could run that pattern backwards uh because one counts as a triangular number two it doesn't look like a triangle but it does count so we have this sequence of triangular numbers do you know who else love triangular numbers gaus and Oiler they all loved them they all loved them but gaus famously loved triangular numbers gaus was so excited about proving his triangular theorem we know he was excited because he wrote about it in his diary and we've got his diary to show you eure he says in Greek num if you can read that bit faint num equals triangle plus triangle plus triangle so every number can be written as three triangles I mean I'm mainly telling you this story because I love this diary entry right this is a acute way of saying the same thing it's an acute triangle is that anything I don't know so this is a lovely way of writing the same thing so it's kind of fun so every number can be written as a sum of triangular numbers in fact every number can be written as a sum of at most three triangular numbers so shall we see this in action if we had a number like 15 right 15 is a triangular number so it only takes one triangle right that's fine okay we're allowed one triangle so 15 one triangle but a number like 16 needs two triangles so it could be 15 and a one that's a bit boring or it could be six and a 10 that's a bit more interesting so there's more than one way you could do it so that's 16 written as two triangles a number like 17 takes three triangles so it might be 10 6 and 1 or it might be 15 1 and 1 would make 17 so 17 needs three triangles it can't be done better so some numbers do need three triangles some numbers need two triangles some numbers need one triangle there are no numbers that need four triangles though that's the idea so that is not easy to prove so this is something that gaus proved the proof is long the proof is long it involves a lot of algebra a lot of number Theory it's like a it's like a chapter of a textbook he wrote a textbook and it was a chapter of his book which ended with this Eureka theorem so it's not an easy thing to prove so I'm just saying it as a fact because it's a nice mathematical fact as well but shall we try and go even further yeah okay so we can WR WR numbers as three triangles what about squares so we could have a sequence of squares so one is a square number four is a square number nine is a square number 16 is a square number 25 is a square number how many squares do we need to write every number okay well this is actually proven first this was actually proven before gaus like 20 years before gaus proved his triang numbers uh so I guess it's not easy but it was easier to prove and we actually proved you can write every number every positive whole number uh with at most four squares I'm going to do 25 because this is a nice one to start with okay so 1 2 3 four five I'm going to do five rows of five that would be a nice Square Five okay so 25 is a square number which means it it needs one square right so it only need one square that's fine 26 needs two squares right 25 and one 27 needs three squares it could be 25 1 and one bit boring it could be 9 n and n 28 needs four squares so it could be 25 one one and one or it could be 9 9 N and a one so again some numbers need four squares some can be done better but there are no numbers that need five squares so this actually goes back to firar firar was daating these ideas so every number can be written as four squares every number can be written as three triangles right he stated this without proof typical just like firar would it's because of those thin margins yes so there's oh there's poor margins so what about going even further can we do pentagon is there such a thing as a pentagon number or a hexagon number yes there is H I'm gonna have to show you this because I can't actually do them they're really difficult to draw you told me triangles was three and squares was four it' be too good to be true if you need five pentagons to make every is that your is that your conjecture that's my conjecture is that your conjecture that was the same as firma's conjecture as well so let's just have a look at what a a pentagon and a hexagon number looks like so they kind of do look like pentagon and hexagons they start with one first Pentagon number you can see looks a bit like a pentagon with five tokens there and then we build bigger pentagons by sort of adding a layer each time same for the hexagon numbers we start with a one the first hexagon number is a six makes a little hexagon shape and then we make bigger hexagons by adding extra layers each time so we get this sequence of Pentagon numbers sequence of hexagon numbers so Brady you've got a conjecture like every number can be written with at most five pentagons at most six yeah so that's what ferar thought as well and it keeps going right in general he thought every positive whole number can be written at with at most n n gonal numbers all right that was proven too so that was proven what another 15 years after gaus proved his result so you're telling me that the famar Haron conjecture yes was proven to be true it was proven to be true proven to be true by a mathematician called Ki again it's another long difficult proof however the modern proof is three pages long using only gauss's Eureka theorem so if you can use ga's Eureka theorem so take ga's work use that work from there you can prove this in general that every positive whole number can be written with n n gonal numbers lovely stuff right do you want me to tell you I mean I I I proved it was Zero pages I just told you oh yeah yeah yeah yeah well that's that's a conjecture I I feel like a con they're easier can we go further Brady can we go what is even further how can we go further how about tetrahedral numbers tetrahedral numbers are numbers that make a tetrahedron which means if I had balls or oranges or something and stacked them into a s triangular based pyramid a tetrahedron how many oranges balls do I need so one starts off the sequence then we have four so we have three on the base and then another one on top then the next tetrahedron is 10 then the next one is 20 and 35 we get a sequence of tetrahedral numbers how many tetrahedral numbers do we need to write every number what's Brady's conjecture on that one 2 n 2 N so n being the number itself what is n so if tetraedron is like a what a foursided yeah solid your conject oh cuz there's oh okay if it's a foursided solid it would be yeah 2 N so you're saying eight is that your conjecture yes yeah it is now yes it is now okay this is a conjecture right it does have a name it's called poock conjecture I said poock you hear me quite distinctly poock conjecture says that every whole number can be written with at most five tetrahedral numbers and that appears to be true but we haven't proven it so that is an unproven statement it appears to be true because it's true for every number we've checked so far how high have we checked I'm not sure but I'm think I would imagine it's in the billions so it's you know we've checked them it appears to be true uh but it hasn't been proven yet I mean the biggest number that needs five tetrahedrons is numbers are being written as four tetrahedrons 3 2 1 so that it's not in the great scheme of things that's not a huge [Music] number so but there could but there could be another one lurking if there was another one lurking amazing great cool and I'll come on number five and I will tell you about it that would be amazing but it appears like this is getting easier with bigger numbers so this is just evidence that perhaps this statement is true because we know some numbers need five tetraedron but it appears to be getting easier after this so five is the conjecture we have proven that every number can be written as a sum of nine Cubes but five Tetons we haven't proven that one yet we'd like to thank Jane Street for supporting in this video and they've created yet another fish puzzle to test your metal have a look at this one it's called bug bite I'll include a link to it in the video description give it a try let me know how you get on there's no cost no strings attached it's just something they've made for fun but while you're on the Jane Street website you might want to check out their programs and events here's where you'll find them again there'll be a link in the description these are fantastic opportunities for all sorts of people high school students undergraduates postgraduates phds you name it whoever you are there's probably a program just for you and for people from all kinds of backgrounds too go and have a look at the website this is a chance to learn how companies like Jan Street work how they use computers and problem solving to trade on the markets this could be a once- in a lifetime opportunity and the start of something really special for your career links down in the description check it all out and don't forget to have a look at that bug bite puzzle and let me know how you go so you might be tempted to try and prove these theorems for yourselves or these conjectures for yourself and go ahead go for it get into the algebra why not play around with the numbers I mean I'm expecting the proofs to be hard uh but you're more than welcome to try out try it out because the point is what you discover along the way even if you don't prove it don't be disappointed it is about the things you learn along the way as well so how about it
