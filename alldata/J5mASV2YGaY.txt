ladies and gentlemen welcome back to the candidates 2024 this is the biggest chess tournament of the year and the winner of this tournament will challenge the world chess champion in a match later in 2024 this is round number five out of 14 it's 14 rounds because it's a double round robin eight players they all play each other uh two times and this round was the best so far yesterday there was a day of rest every quarter of the tournament the players get a day to rest and today they showed up and dear Lord they delivered from start to finish today's recap is going to be electric I've been watching the games for six hours the players just got down about 5 minutes ago here we go we kick things off with the Battle of Ali Raa fuja versus hikara Nakamura the tournament is running away from these players guys like yanomi already have three points having a one and a half point gap between yourself and the person leading the event is really bad so that puts a lot of pressure on everybody else Ali Resa opens up with E4 E5 from hikaro and there is a lot of pressure on Hikaru first of all he tried to take a little bit of that pressure off of himself as the tournament began talking about the fact that uh he doesn't feel you know as let's say as much of an intense of a drive as the as as the people do about this whole title and candidates and everything uh but this game my man showed up to play he showed up to play because in this position a position that has been explored millions of times in an Italian hikaro played the move H6 he takes away Ali resa's Bishop to G5 which is a main weapon of the Italian and induces white into getting into a fight Hikaru is basically messing with his opponent a little bit trying to get him to swing and he does and not only does hikaro play the fourth most popular move in this position in this position he doesn't Retreat the bishop to the Natural square instead the third most popular move so first we play the four fourth most popular move and then in that position we play the third most popular move and guess what we have alza out of prep Queen B3 he targets the pawn on F7 Hikaru castles and now A4 after a little bit of time we have D6 from Hikaru alza plays Knight bd2 3 minutes spent on that move Ali RZA is not really in a level of prep that he is comfortable with and we have left a lot of known Theory now what's interesting is Hikaru on the very next turn plays one of the most ridiculous moves that I have ever seen in an opening like the Italian in this position following basic developmental principles Hikaru undevelop the Knight what this is so provocative but the idea is that White's Bishop is in the center and black can very quickly strike back so you kind of baited your opponent into playing all of these aggressive pawn moves and it's actually your opponent who's going to feel a little bit of that pressure in the center what's interesting is Hikaru was following a very similar game not exactly but a game between Fabiano Carana and prag Nanda six years ago at the World Cup in 2018 maybe seven years ago in 2017 if you look at the database that kind of game with Knight to B8 was reached and so Al Resa said you know what I'm going D4 10 minutes spent he plays the move d4 and he says I'm not going to let you get your D5 and the board explodes we have Ed CD hikaro l es out with A5 forces alira to do something alira marches down the center of the board Knight jumps out to H5 and back into the action attacking alir resa's Pawn on the G2 Square G3 now Karu Ducks underneath lands across almost knock my own glasses off counter punches in the center of the board sacrificing a pawn in order to get the bishop Ali resa is not interested and instead brings the bishop back to the F1 square look at both guys it is the 15th move of the game and on the 15th move of the game both guys have spent minutes this is a sign of a highlevel classical chess battle Bishop to G2 hikaro creates the structure with C6 now we get into a little bit of a maneuvering phase both guys making Necessary preparations for the next explosion Bishop C3 we don't have to wait long C5 Hikaru going for it Ali Resa plays Rook F to B1 Hikaru holds together the queen side with Rook A6 takes Bishop C5 and right around here as both guys were kind of locked in this I mean it's a wrestling match of chess pieces hikaru's Queen and Rook are stacked on the a file Ali resa is targeting that The Rook is trapped it can't go anywhere Knight C4 cuts the communication of the white position though the Knight jumps out to B3 hitting the bishop on C5 yes we could spend 10 minutes analyzing all of the hypothetical possibilities and I'm sure people will make a 1 hour to 90-minute video of just this game and that is absolutely worthwhile it is totally worth exploring but the players can't even do that themselves remember on the 40th move they either run out of time or get the 30 minutes of the next time control and they don't have a lot of time to do that Queen A8 Bishop G2 the tension is building Hikaru makes an inaccurate decision here but alira doesn't capitalize it would have been better for alza to Route the Knight back to the middle of the board for some reason maybe then he can go to the F4 square but Knight to E1 was correct instead he goes this way and very quickly Hikaru gets back into the game now right around here I thought we were heading probably for some sort of peaceful resolution they both have four moves to make or they lose on time one each two each oh my goodness I mean rookie one and Ali Resa looks like he's absolutely dominating Hikaru here Rooks Queen Bishop Hikaru the best defensive player in the world I would argue one of the most elusive makes the 40th time control Ali RZA can't break through so Ali RZA tries to break through he thinks for a little while and tries to break hikaru's defenses and Hikaru creates a blockade on the dark squares look at this and at this point I was like wait a minute Hikaru is playing for for a win hikaru's got the endgame Advantage he's got the dark Square blockade against the pawn and against the bishop but alyza was so clever here and he build up a really nice defensive setup Hikaru tried his best but that's it Unstoppable Force meets a movable object and right here there was a moment for the players to go home Rook takes D4 Knight takes Rook takes Rook F5 all the pawns fall off the board Ali Resa didn't like something and instead of that continues to try to attack and now we get into a little tactical Skirmish we have King takes Rook check Hikaru blocks take take and the bishop can't discover an attack on the king because it's going to get taken but alyza plays E7 and Hikaru saw all of this ahead of time and lands himself in this end game and now only black can win how's that possible well black has more pawns he a rook for a knight is bad but Ali Resa doesn't have the amount of time to go and take this Pawn and then take this Pawn right and then and and then try he's just going to lose because black is too quick Rook A8 D2 black is too fast Rook d8 Knight D3 white resigns so Knight F4 only Hikaru can win they both have less than four minutes King to F1 played by Ali Reza hikaro pushes the pawn alza comes forward hikaro grabs the pawn with check now King E3 if black gets greedy and tries to defend all the pawns now white does have time and now it is a very complicated endgame it's basically a roll of the dice someone's going to win someone's going to lose maybe it's going to be a draw so in this position on the 61st move of the game hikaro played the move Pawn to G4 like this and said Ali Reza you cannot take my Pawn because I will sneak through alyza either has to go here he has to go to G8 he can even go to d8 but he cannot take the pawn and with 96 seconds remaining on the clock he took and he played that move with one second remaining after the 40th or the 60th move of the game the players get bonus time time is added to their clock so they don't lose on time that's the time control and I believe in this position maybe it's 10 seconds Ali Resa took the pawn and in this position he resigned he resigned because if Rook G8 that doesn't stop the pawn at all because Rook takes Knight check Ali Reza played a back and forth battle and made one mistake and lost it all immediately and aliv Resa fuja goes down to hikaro a massive I cannot understate how massive of a win this is for Hikaru one and a half out of four one and a half points out of first place a win with black it literally does not get any better than that the narrative spinning on social media after some of the inter interviews and answers and things like that oh my goodness this man you would think is he he is one of the most polarizing figures in the game and this man showed up and won with black and on the flip side of this result is Ali Resa fuja who now for a second candidates in a row is tied for last he has one and a half out of five three draws and two losses that is insane and that was just the beginning of today's recap isn't that incredible we got a whole lineup of games of Banger after Banger after Banger so uh yeah I'll let you all take a breather uh go like grab a snack just keep the you know maybe we'll throw an ad in here or something put put it up on the smart TV you know I know where you guys watch you watching the smartphone smart TV whatever desktop oh my goodness what a round this was pull up this game pre-tournament favorite I said this was my prediction I said Hikaru nepo Fabiano those are the big three and I said of all the Indian Super Stars I think all eyes are on Prague and he showed up in this game looking for a fight he opened with E4 yanomi I will remind you of a statistic has played two candidates and he's in the middle of the third he has played 32 games of Chess at the candidates tournament he has been leading the tournament or tied for first throughout his life all those games he is unbreakable with black and he is performing at over for 2900 with white and with black he plays the patro defense he is probably the world's leading expert at the moment maybe not name Fabiano Carana on this opening Knight E5 D6 Knight F3 Knight E4 D4 nobody even plays this anymore against Yan because he knows it like the back of his hand but team prananda and prananda himself showed up today played C4 played Knight C3 this is World Championship level preparation Yan pishi had two training camps to play for the title of chess the title of Chess Bishop F5 this is a new and modern approach to the Petro defense you don't need to know the specifics but after Bishop to G5 Queen to A5 there is a move Knight to H4 this move was played once in 2018 between Anish giri and Fabiano Carana both of those names might mean something to you since then this concept has been played over a 100 times this is the way modern level CHS developed they go down a path they explore it Knight to H4 now Bishop E6 takes the queen takes the bishop the Knight comes to F3 while it's hanging Queen A5 and in this position Bishop H3 is played now the bishop is hanging and the pawn is hanging couple of fun facts about this position historically white comes back this way this Pawn is Untouchable because it's too dangerous this move has been played less than 10 times in human history but earlier in 2023 it was played against nepo and in that game nepo went here Prague knew all of this he was ready to face him here and nepo knew the new best move is this this move has never been played yanomi takes the pawn on C3 and it's basically poker at this point who is going to out prep who and Prague wins the battle because after Rook B1 B6 and Rook B3 Queen A5 neither guy has spent much time here both guys memorize the first 18 moves of the game compare that to this game Ali Resa versus Hikaru where after 15 moves both guys had spent a combined 100 minutes here both guys have spent no time in this position prag plays the move D5 and all hell breaks loose D5 is a brilliant sacrifice it cuts the Queen's access that way you cannot take with the queen because you would walk into the a complete bulldozer so D5 Yan spend 40 minutes capturing a pawn this is nuts at this point the engine is rumbling back home Prague doesn't even think Knight to G5 team Prague finds this idea they find an idea to pose massive problems for black if black defends the position perfectly he's going to make a draw that's the way chess works if he doesn't defend the position properly his soul will be taken from his body Yan does not find the best way he finds a way that leads to a ridiculous attack now it very well could be the only way the engine finds all sorts of different things it likes G6 stopping white from playing Queen H5 but the position is a nightmare no pun intended you can literally sack your knight and take and try to win The Rook back I mean it is craziness Jan goes here and prag Nanda sacrifices his Knight this move doesn't quite deserve a brilliant because it's all homecook preparation King takes F7 and now not Rook F3 check not Queen H5 not even Queen F3 not even Queen E2 threatening mate Prague gives away a knight for free and plays Rook D3 50 minute time Advantage nepo is in disarray he plays Knight D7 after another 13 minutes of thought which is the only move you need to counter sacrifice your knight so you can run away to safety and it doesn't even get captured Prague is still in his prep and in this position the only way not to lose everything is to sacrifice this bishop with check and then put the Knight on C5 and it's important you do that so this king is kind of out in the open you need to bait White's King out into the open then try to defend yourself then run your king to safety and in a tragic turn of events yanomi blunders and the bishop gets taken and Prague is winning 24 moves of prep Prague is winning the idea is Queen to D5 check King G8 Queen D5 check now why did Prague spend 16 minutes on this check it's the only move I mean what else can you well G3 is a option to bring the bishop back and around but he does ultimately come up with this and on high depth he is winning if he plays Queen E5 Queen E5 sets up rook takes Pawn check if black in this position tries to defend the pawn bishop F5 forces you back and you lose so king h8 queen E5 you can also run over here so that's not possible then I go Rook G6 Rook F7 I sacrifice The Rook I give you this check and then I take here King G7 Queen D5 and I'm up upon pawn and I'm probably playing for a win but it's even crazier than that because the top Engine line after king h8 and queen E5 Queen A2 is Bishop F5 King G8 Sid stepping that Bishop B1 and then Queen B2 so if black takes the pawn and goes back you win the battle for this diagonal and you win the game I mean this is if Prague had detonated 29 moves of prep I would have given up hope so Prague now after Queen D5 is about to take down the man that has literally never not led a candidate's tournament and he blunders the move order is important you have to start with Queen E5 threatening this because after this Yan Knight B7 the Queens are staring at each other there is an x-ray attack on the bishop on F5 and The Rook is hanging as well you can take this I'll take with a knight you can take this I'll take this and in an unbelievable turn of events Yan escapes and he is still under pressure but that's it Prague just tries his best but psychologically you simply cannot recover from this he did his best we get into a rook end game on the 44th move of the game the game ends in a draw I mean oh you talk about a missed opportunity he detonated I can't even express what he just did he showed up with an in just a brilliant piece of preparation two pawns and a knight if this is showing us anything about this tournament Prague has God level preparation I mean good luck to the rest of the players and then he just didn't put it away and I will never understand why he didn't play Queen E5 I'm not saying I would have played Queen E5 but I wonder what he saw because he he saw Queen E5 and he didn't play it in favor of Bishop here and I will never know what he didn't see and Prague draws the game and Jan maintains three and a half and top position Now quickly we're going to pop over because actually today the women were relatively peaceful and humpy versus ganino was a was a regular queen Gambit uh game the players got very tactical early but the queens were sort of traded and uh White had a little bit of a nice position but ultimately it came down to Black getting some strong counterplay and um it turned into a rook end game that ended in a draw now tandi from China nuril salimova this was aaro Khan this was the one of the best positions that somebody had today White had a very instructive bind but grabbed the pawn and that was enough for black to get very active and take fight uh the fight to White on the light squares after a quick Skirmish Queen back to F2 nurul fought back very very nicely and despite being a pawn down for most of the game defended very well Bishop C4 got active got her Pawn back another Rook end game and another draw I think you can kind of understand understand where we're heading today Vali versus Anam musuk Anam musuk is at some good positions and I'm just going to fast forward through this one because Vali came to fight it was a very complicated back and forth game and in this position everything is closing up an amuch chuk can win this game if she takes back the right way and apparently the right way is with this Pawn to open up the B file and create C6 possibilities she takes back the wrong way and this is just a fortress there is absolutely no way in here for anybody and the players agreed to withdraw the biggest mist of the day was in the L game where Katerina lagno got very aggressive and actually had a fantastic position she was winning with tactics flying all over the board ripping open the white king as you can see Queen D6 and she had a huge attack I mean I really cannot understate how how aggressive this position was but Ling GF fought back and um I think we you know like right around here was maybe the biggest moment of the game black could have played Bishop F3 and created some mating chances but white would have went here and kept fighting but this was maybe the biggest Miss of the day uh but uh and then here there's a funny board glitch where like uh The Rook doesn't take but it it it took back and um takes and takes was played and uh they made a draw actually the women were very peaceful today four draws couple of fighting games but I I mean out of respect to all the candidates I'm putting them in today's recap but they were pretty peaceful and the men they were throwing Tantrums all over the place I mean it was spectacular uh vid GUI uh vidit uh I'm just goingon to say vidit G I know his his middle name is Santos but I want his flag there uh this one was nuts so Fabiano sensed weakness okay Fabiano half a point out of first place half a point behind nepo plays the Sicilian why is heing to hunt vidit has nothing to do with respecting or disrespecting it has to do with the fact that vidit just lost two games in a row and you hunt a man who's lost two games in the candidates because the guy who lost two games in the candidates might want to draw but he also might want to catch the guy in first place so he's stuck in a weird place and we saw already Fabiano play like this he played like this against alza do you remember that no of course not remembering openings is diffult but he allowed a Rosal Lio and then he played Knight to F6 I do think that was against Ali RZA it was a very complicated game we have takes we have takes and Fabby plays the most provocative way possible Bishop H5 Bishop to F4 and I do just want to say by the way vid is like vidit likes his D4 stuff so E4 from vidit I mean this is the this is this is very impressive stuff he's fighting Fabby and a Sicilian Bishop F4 Fabby play played so aggressively here vidit spends like 20 minutes on the Move Bishop F4 Fabby strikes at him with a c Pawn no development at all and plays Z6 he's like waving a bull on and he tanks here vid it and he finds the best move the best move in this position is to punish black for playing like this take as much space as possible Queen B3 incredible move giving up this Pawn completely because Queen B7 ravages the black position Queen B6 played Bishop E3 saying Fabby take me Fabby comes back to C7 and vid plays this vid is down a lot on time he's down 48 minutes but he has a dominant position and Fabiano here plays Knight D7 he spends eight minutes plays Knight D7 and he's I mean he's he's trying to fight vidit but he doesn't have his feet under him so vidit plays Knight H4 vidit a little hesitant and finally the attack is upon us the engine here was giving a massive advantage to the white position like like a deep engine was giving a massive Advantage it was saying that white is much much much better and vidit found takes and D4 very principled a guy is trying to fight with you on the edge of the board while his King is in the center he can't really Castle so what do you do you just take the center he has more space he's not castled how is he possibly going to attack you it violates all of the principles of Chess but Fab's going for it sacrificing a pawn that's a free Pawn but it opens the a file which could ultimately come back to haunt VI B5 Knight C5 vidit just very principled let's just play a position where I'm a pawn up all Fabby has is the a file that's it if I consolidate this position correctly I'm going to beat Fabiano kowana and I'm going to get back to 50% H4 courageous you can't take this it's not capturable because then I infiltrate on the H file so Fabi now plays Rook A4 plants targets the center vidit plays the best move Bishop D4 targeting the pawn on G7 and defending Against The Rook on the a file E5 from Fabby is a losing move Fabiano caruana is now losing because of the sniper shot Queen G3 and vidit pins the pawn to the queen Fabiano now has to play Queen A7 he spends 12 minutes because he realizes the game is over his Blu did not work out it has been called and vidit has more than enough time all he has to do now is stay calm he takes on E5 with the Queen the bishop is pinned the pawn is about to get hit Rook takes A2 yes this is a check it is very scary you can already run away if you want but there's no need you can just take the pawn on G7 this check does absolutely nothing this check does even less because of B3 and Bishop back you're winning Queen E4 doesn't matter because you have King C1 and you hide and you win Queen G7 Rook f8 vided is up two pawns against iano Carana and 12 minutes he has 12 minutes to make 14 moves but he's got to stay focused now Rook A1 doesn't work but the only winning move in this position is to run the King has to be brave vidit has to be brave he has to run he doesn't run and guys like Fabiano guys like nepo you give them one chance to make a comeback the door is sealed shut he seals the door shut you are now no longer going to be able to escape you might say what's the big deal well the big deal is I now play F6 this check is no longer that scary because I run away and let's say you go Queen G3 Rook A1 King D2 you lose the bishop you lose the game so vidit had to run oops vidit had to run he had to to play King C1 check doesn't work because you escape and when the queen comes in you're already too fast Queen B4 King E3 Queen B3 even King F4 is winning by the way vidit had to be brave Fabiano shuts the door the game is now forced to end in a draw because if vid doesn't repeat the position he will literally lose the game to Rook A1 mate heartbreak just like the Prague game just like the I mean you literally can cannot script these things vidit played so well but it's literally never over it's never over against the guys that are in their 30s that have played multiple candidates nepo got one chance on move 20 like seven Fabiano has one chance and he takes it Queen A4 unbelievable absolutely unbelievable and it's crazy because Queen E5 lost the advantage for vidit and it would have won the game for Prague it's the same move and that takes me to the final game of the day gesh D AKA gkes de maraju versus NAD abasov NAD just made three draws with white and lost the game with black GES is close to being in the lead for first place he plays E4 we have another pet just like we saw in the nepo game this one gukesh sends us to kind of an offbeat line with D4 Bishop D3 and all of this has been played We are following the main line okay so we are following something that has been played many many many many times and you usually the way White sets up here in the hundreds of games is Bishop 2 E3 C3 Knight D2 Lukes plays Rook E1 and then he plays here so gukesh does not put the bishop on E3 yet he plays in a way nobody's ever played before we are officially out in no man's land he gets a game that's the most important thing he's rated 2743 he's half a point out of first place he has to play a game he has to win a game against n basa that is the only way he wins this game he ties nepple for first he doesn't know that because the game is going on Knight D7 look a boss of 10 minutes spent 10 minutes and the reason is because if you bring the bishop out the bishop becomes a Target and if you bring the bishop out the bishop becomes a Target Knight F1 Knight E3 for example Knight D4 so Knight D7 and abos of tries to get rid of the pawn pretty quickly we have a c we have an imbalance four on the queen side for black three on the queen side for white three on two on the king side which means all of the end games are going to be super imbalanced Knight bd2 but it doesn't get started very good for gukesh he is down a lot on time early his structure is looking solid but I have no idea how on Earth he's going to create winning chances here really black is just doing a great job look at this we just have Queens Rooks and Knight that's it but suddenly a BOS of is playing defense and suddenly GES owns the only open file and suddenly gash is making progress and suddenly gukesh is nearly winning he's cutting the communication of the black position the D4 Pawn is weak the A4 Pawn is weak he plays Rook E4 Rook E5 and both guys repeat once they're not going to repeat the position look at this position from gash but on Second Glance kukesh has four minutes he four minutes he's up a pawn but abasov is is two squares for making another queen the only reason the Bosa can't just go D2 it's because the queen comes back and then I just stop the pawn like the pawn can't just run away so Queen A4 abasa plays Queen A2 kkash plays this which is okay G6 Queen B4 he's winning he has five moves kkash has 100 seconds to make five moves or he loses on time in the candidates rookie won he just spent 30 seconds on that move Rook e 80 has four moves to make Rook E4 keeping the tension Rook takes Rook takes Rook D5 gkes has 50 seconds to make two moves or he loses on time he goes here not the best he could have blockaded maybe play for B4 he goes here Knight G7 and on the 40th move he plays the nervous King to G1 gets his extra time but now he loses the pawn on C5 and his Advantage is gone his advant is gone and it's it's going to begin all the way from the beginning unbelievable another game of a of of one of the Indians I mean prag and V it was a round of just of of heartbreak for India I it's just unreal and then here abasa lost his mind somewhere in all of this head spinning complications and all of this and all of this it's very easy to say well why didn't he abasa gave up the pawn he spent 6 minutes clearly he didn't like something because I guess he was worried about B4 so he just gave up the pawn on his own he just completely gave the pawn up he didn't need to do that I guess he thought he was going to lose the pawn but now gukesh gets the pawn and a couple of moves later look at Knight F4 coming in from from abasov threatening Knight to E2 right threatening all of this Rook E3 and maybe abasov thought he had Rook D3 here which kind of cuts the communication can't take because of this but after Queen C2 you're completely fine so he goes here instead and this is just a pure Bluff this is a pure bluff if gash in this position takes on C6 he wins the game he wins the game because this looks terrifying but you go King F1 and that's it it's over so how is it over I don't would Rook H2 well that's not a threat Rook E8 check K H7 and I have for example Rook B8 and Rook B7 I just win but black has Knight D5 Rook B7 but this is not made because you're pinned oh brutal so kukes has to see all of this he has to see after Queen C6 but kukes doesn't have a lot of time he has 5 minutes again so he goes here and again gukesh Against All Odds the position is back to equal it goes into a queen end game and abos of can defend this forever three on four it is so close and GES has to start over he's doing the his very best the pawn is a few squares away from queening it's on the the outermost part of the board so at this point we rely on something in chess called the table base table base means chess is solved with a certain amount of pieces on the board or less it's a little bit too early right now but in a couple of moves this happens there are now seven pieces remaining on the chessboard an engine with a database terabytes of data tells you that this is a draw if black defends correctly and gukesh has a second lease on life he would love to trade the queens and promote the pawn and he's doing his best but abasov defends very well checking him into Oblivion we are now past 70 Moves the game is a draw it's still a draw queen d8 queen D6 and at this point both guys get a new Queen they trade and they both get a new Queen and this is a draw if black defends correctly there is simply no way for white to push the pawn or to trade the Queens into a winning King and pawn end game I'll give you an example all right something like I know that blunder is a pawn but something like this is a winning King in Pawn end game so you want to avoid that Queen A7 King H6 Queen E3 and in this position kukesh is winning if he finds Queen C5 check the idea of Queen C5 is to then sneak back to f8 sneak back to F5 and you force the trade of Queens for example here you have check here King F7 there's no checks and you escort your Pawn the rest of the way it's not stalemate because the queen can move but he misses it but it's still really complicated and now the only move here for abasov is Queen G2 stopping all the checks Queen to G2 in fact setting a trap here's a nice way to lose the game but instead of that on the 83rd move of the game abasov plays Queen F1 and geshi uses the queen as a shield and not only is it a shield anywhere the king moves it's a discovered check and then he gives a check and then he's going to trade the queen and he wins King F6 check Queen G5 check abas of resigns gesh it took 87 moves it took six hours but gukesh is tied for first after five rounds of the candidates these are your standings everything remained the same on the women's side because they all made draws nepo and gukesh tied for first Fabiano in second and Hikaru and Prague with 50% on Two and a Half massive win for Hikaru the tournament could have been spinning out of control for him but he gets a win with black Fabiano right there it's a one-point race in the men's we have nine more rounds to go see you all tomorrow for round number six get out of here
