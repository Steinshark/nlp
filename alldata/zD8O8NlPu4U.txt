we we'd also you know we need to remember that Christ is the perfect example of all of this right right so his ministry was three years long but his whole life you know as a carpenter um was he like carving crosses and giving them to people you know probably not that would have been a weird time but you know his his whole reality would have been offered up to the father as a prayer and he and because he's Christ he does everything perfectly which means it's perfectly humble right so when people come to me and they say yeah I'm thinking about doing this thing or whatever I'm like great do it and do it as well as you possibly can because when you do that they get well be prideful about it no you will if it's actually done well it'll be done in the image of Christ and it'll be perfectly humble it'll be a great offering um and that's you know like Father Chris said I don't think there's necessarily it's not a problem like Christ doesn't call us to be Bankers or artists or lawyers or Housewives he calls bankers and artists and lawyers and Housewives to be disciples that's what he calls um so whatever you do do it as well as you possibly can it'll be a good icon um and if it's bad art it probably stems from Bad theology get your theology corrected [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] so hello everybody I am very pleased to be here with Father Christopher Father James and Father David also known as the band luxury some of you might have followed their stories some of you might not know but they started a band a long time ago when they were young a rock band and uh many events in their lives brought them ultimately to not all of the people in the band but three who are here with us today to convert Orthodoxy and ultimately to become priests and there's a documentary about that called parallel love which is a wonderful documentary I recommend it to to anyone which kind of traces the story so we're going to look into to a little bit what their story is you know the different uh they put out an album a few years ago as well they even did some live shows this summer which you hadn't done in a while and also their future projects and we'll also talk about what it means to be an Orthodox Christian who is also involved in secular art and so fathers thank you for uh thank you for coming to talk to me thank you for having us and so I'm hoping one of you can maybe just tell our audience this just the basic story of how it is that I'm talking to three rock rock and roll priests here it's father Chris's job yeah Chris's job I knew I was going to be conscripted well uh the three of us you know actually met in college uh back in the early 90s uh when all of us were very kind of interested in music and playing music we met at this Conservative Christian College desperate to find like-minded musicians uh and we wound up starting a band together um played around uh kind of the Atlanta Athens Southeastern scene uh for a number of years uh eventually we got signed to tooth and nail records uh after playing a festival up in Illinois but around that same time uh at least Father David and I uh were also studying church history with a with a group of friends uh that led us eventually into discovering uh the Eastern Orthodox faith we wound up converting much to Father James uh Chagrin at the time uh but eventually uh Father James and his wife became Orthodox as well but you know the band continued uh during that time uh you know we were touring and playing quite a bit um and then as we started getting older and having children uh the the live aspect of the band uh waned uh I eventually went off to Seminary uh to pursue the priesthood and then a number of years later Father James father David did as well uh and then uh got a phone call from Father David about 2013. saying hey man I'm writing some more songs you guys want to go in the studio uh so we did uh and then around the same time a friend of ours Matt who's also in the band but was a filmmaker I just thought it would be really interesting to do a story and a documentary on you know the story of the band uh the fact that three of us became Orthodox priests this is the the first album and writing and recording since being priest and um the the documentary has done very well much to our surprise we thought maybe two or three people would be interested in it but uh NPR and other places uh were very interested so it's been a interesting last few years uh as priests trying to navigate being priests but also playing rock and roll so you played some live concerts this summer how was that do you wear your cat socks no no no no Father James maybe you talk about that experience yeah so it was last summer we played um I don't know what to say about it I mean we hadn't played in ages uh and I guess the idea had come up that maybe we could try to do some shows and wanting to promote the record a little bit even the record record stretched out trophies stretched out for ages before we actually got it released um and I'm not I can't remember how it all kind of came about but we ended up um being asked to play at a festival in Alabama furnace Fest which is primarily like hardcore punk rock metal kind of thing and we got asked to play which was funny and but it was beautiful did they reach out to you yeah oh yeah um I think so is that correct I think so I think I think they came to us first we weren't looking to play and in the process of doing that we thought well we probably ought to play another show before that to sort of warm up to that and ended up playing a show and at the Earl in Atlanta which is kind of a cool club we hadn't played there in many years um so we ended up playing in two shows which was crazy so we you know we had these rehearsals and I don't I I was pretty nervous about actually getting on stage again but it ended up being I mean it ended up being a lot of fun it was it was enjoyable it's you know it's a diversion but um but we ended up doing that last year and um I mean I don't not the not the then prove we couldn't do it anymore we proved that we still could do something but uh we did it and there it is it's on video in places so oh it is can you find that video we could find it no no we can't find the video it's well hidden okay all right I would have liked it I would have liked to see that and Father David since you're singing how was that for you in terms of a concert because that different energy yeah it was very different um you know again like Father Chris said we have we hadn't played together live in that in that setting for almost 20 years and so um it was a very different energy now being a priest and sort of what I felt comfortable doing what I didn't feel I felt very much self-conscious the whole time um which I I didn't feel that earlier you know early on and so it might have been a lot of it might have been just around singing live which is a difficult thing to do and trying to be energetic and all that but not so much the priests stuff I didn't that wasn't the uncomfortable part um it was more of just not having done this in so long so yeah and also I imagine being older and just being more aware of certain things in terms of yeah you still want to be like exciting and interesting and provocative and all that and there is somewhere in the back your head the idea of priesthood your congregation and all of that who weren't there thank god um because that would be even stranger you know because it's a different reality but no I mean it's just you know you get older and you want to you want to want to be a pro age appropriate that kind of thing um it was uh it was odd you know and how what age were the people in the audience that's probably was it was it a bunch of 20 year olds like there's a bunch of teenagers or was it more kind of adults definitely it was more people are I mean we're all over 50 now and so yeah it was definitely more of our dead Rock Crown but it was it was loud he played hard and heavy and loud and it was great you know uh I don't really want to do it again but yeah it was a good experience I mean I think that that's interesting if you're saying you don't you don't want what why don't you want to do it again it doesn't do anything for me in particular at this point like my my own interest is in songwriting and making records that kind of thing that's where my I get the most joy and interest out of that the playing live thing I suppose if we did it more often I would I would feel I could make get my way into it a little bit more but it's not uh I don't have I don't really have any interest in that so but I don't even go to shows anymore so you know I just don't have a lot of experience you know interest in that kind of thing so but it's still an interesting in the the music part like it's not it's not disillusioned with the music it's just the live thing is not the right yeah I mean the whole The Arc of making music and putting out music and then the live part of that like my interest ends once the record when I'm holding it in my hand that's where that's where I finished my job and anything beyond that I don't have any interest in at all so so Father James father Christopher what about you in terms of the live experience did you have a similar experience I had a lot more fun than I thought I would I have the same kind of hesitation you know you're a priest you know but like a lot of things you know some priests they go out and they play golf I guess or they um I don't know what's something analogous they go fishing or hiking or people who watch you though people don't watch you yeah well yeah yeah this is this is different but it's like I don't know I mean that I enjoyed it a lot but I'm with my brother I'm kind of I it's that's uh you know it's fine I mean it's it's I like to get together with the band I enjoy that part and if people want to watch us getting together I mean we have a lot of fun we tell jokes and we sit around they could just we could do that we could just have a rehearsal they could just all watch us sitting there eating a meal and then making jokes and playing for five minutes and then correcting you know that if that we could do that that would be more fun but um maybe that's a concept maybe we could a terrible idea when it's time has come I don't know well back to you by the Christopher yeah I mean I I enjoyed it and um you know I'm open to doing it again but it was certainly uh there was tension I mean just how do we do this like you know we we're performing in front of people and it's it's but we're we're priests and we're not I don't know it just you know the tension of all of that I I think at some point I I just said okay well I guess just embrace the tension of it and um you know just kind of remember who we are um so you know I'm not opposed to doing it again but you know it just I realized kind of what Father David said I mean it didn't really do anything for me in terms of like oh we got to do this more often it was just it was fun it just felt like kind of uh Nostalgia especially the show in Atlanta being able to see a bunch of friends of ours that's where we used to play all of the time so it just felt like a reunion of sorts and so many of our extended plan down there you know many of them have also become Orthodox over the years so that was just pretty neat to see some of them and yeah so I this is something I mean we've had conversations before I think all maybe I don't know if I've had this conversation with all three of you for sure two of you for sure and Father David so even in the things you're saying I feel a little a need like there's an uneasiness in the way that you express your relationship to to to the music now to the concert uh I don't know if it's uneasiness or at least a sense in which you're not sure how to place your feet maybe that's the best way to understand like how do I position myself um and so I know that there's a lot of people watching this uh a lot of people who are in the the secular art World um you know people who do animation video games that watch my content you know people who reach out to me and a lot and many people feel that that uneasiness you could say not sure how it is do I live these these two lives and so I I was wondering if you if it's something that you're let's say exploring on your own do you see a connection is there a connection between your Orthodox faith and the music or do you feel like it really is just two lines running next to each other well I mean I I thought I think a lot about that I I think our our the bands sort of prime uh Prime experience was pre-internet days so there was a there was an aspect of it where that was very segmented like this was what you do you can get up on stage nobody really knows anything about you there's not it's a it's a Persona that you can you sort of adopt and there's a kind of comfort in that where you can just simply you can be that thing in that setting and there's no you know nobody's taking cell phone videos of your playing you know there's nothing that's suddenly this becomes a permanent sort of reality right and you can kind of create that and take some sort of comfort in creating that Persona and entering into it nowadays you know it's they all they know who you are they know your wives names I know they've seen pictures of your kids they see your Facebook page your Instagram and all these different things like it's suddenly it's all just jammed together and that's I think where the discomfort comes is um how you know am I priest when I'm playing music well people know you're a priest because they've seen your stuff right or am I a musician when I'm a priest that's the other you know we feel the same sort of tension in church you know so I think we live in an age which is way too Overexposed with all of our our realities right um and so my own discomfort um is about you know how much do I want people to know about me you know um and the reason I don't have a you know sort of YouTube no offense a YouTube channel these different things like I I just don't want that much sort of exposure I don't I want to be somewhat mysterious still right um so that I can keep some for me personally I can keep some bifurcated realities in my life I think a little bit I don't that make sense or not but this is a different age we live in and your your musicians nowadays sort of I think they have to have everything out there all the time for everybody and I think that's a yeah I I think the flip side of that I mean we've talked a lot about this kind of amongst the band and I mean Father David you always make that point that you know parallel lines don't intersect and so this idea of but you know I think there is the sense that we have always struggled as a band you know trying to understand how does our Christian faith kind of inform our arts and and vice versa and you know we never set out to be a Christian band or you know have this agenda to win souls or whatever we were just you know trying to create art but you know I think and I mentioned this in in the movie this idea like Father Alexander schmerman talks a little bit about in his book for the life of the world about this vocation of being a priest of creation who takes the matter of this world and offers it up to God with Thanksgiving and praise and then it gets returned to us as something life-giving I know for me in my journey into Orthodoxy whilst being in a band at the same time that was so helpful for me I think to just think of art that way you know that we're somehow offering up the matter just like Bread and Wine eucharistically we're offering up the matter of our talents and hopefully God blesses it and we can create something beautiful and you know it reflects our our life and our world of you um so I think that's been helpful I think for us as a band to think about it that way also so I mean I would say about that though like we wouldn't do this in the church like right yeah well that's the I think that that's really where in some ways it becomes fascinating for me or to think about because and and I think that's probably why people are so fascinated by your story as well because if you were Protestant pastors you could probably do it in the church right it would be you would be using it as worship music or whatever you could you could do that and you could get away with it right you could have the concert in the church and get away with it but in for sure everybody knows that you couldn't do this in church like you couldn't use it it's not a lit it's not a strictly liturgical action in the in the strict sense uh but at the same time as as music right but at the same time like in the words of Father Alexander schmerman that you mentioned and I think just in general in terms of say maximus and the way that we understand Christ's presence in the world we have a sense in which liturgical the form of the Liturgy or what the Liturgy does can be applied at smaller levels right I often talk about how a family meal is somewhat liturgical it's not strictly liturgical but it's somewhat liturgical because it's Binding Together around a common a common thing you know there's a type of dance that happens in a in a family meal that is ritualized and I think there's the same thing with the concert but I I'm trying to I'm I'm trying to see father Christopher like what is it that it it's expressing right the the let's say what positive thing even if we think in terms of of uh of Orthodox mindset what positive thing does rock and roll manifest like what could it manifest as positive and this is like a really like this is this is not I'm this is not a trick question it's not a I'm really trying to I'm I myself am trying to kind of see this I have kind of an idea but I'd like to hear your thought about it yeah I mean I'll say a few things but you guys can jump in as well I I just know when I first heard your talk on the the Pentecost for the zombie apocalypse and you you talked about this idea of kind of like a a narthex art or kind of I can't remember how you term it but it's kind of like it's not quite in the church but it's somehow reflecting something of reality it's entering into even kind of the depths of The Human Experience um and I mean I'm a bass player so I mean my bass player my my bass parts are entering but when I think of you know like Father David and his themes you know in his lyrics I mean I think there's a there's definitely a depth there maybe in the same way that like folk music is an Eastern European countries like these aren't songs that we would hear in the Liturgy but they're definitely you know reflecting on a lived experience um for those producing it hmm I want to hear someone else's ideas on this I know Father David it's something that that that racks like really kind of rattles in you so I want to hear what you think well I mean honestly it's never been too much of a tension for me as far I've never I've never tried I've never thought that I needed to write songs or lyrics that um directly correspond to sort of My Life as a as a Christian as a priest or anything like that um all of my life in the church My Life as a priest it all has tremendous uh impact on how I write songs um in the sense of you know it's flavored with these ideas of the Risen The rhythms of liturgical life and all and the imagery of that and the questions that I asked but um it's just I've never felt compelled to to turn that into something that's sort of explicit um so I guess there's not a lot of maybe the I don't know maybe the uh in fact I probably try to avoid it more than anything more than anything um I think you know recently I wrote a song over the last couple years that actually has the name Jesus in it um which is the first time I've ever done that um but it's somebody had written it in graffiti on a wall right that's sort of the that's how I brought it into into that um and that's that seems natural to me as opposed to the pro you know the private thing that we do as Christians um you know the privacy of worship and all that kind of thing yeah I wouldn't use that in rock music well that's a this is why it's so fascinating in some ways because you have a sense of what is truly sacred and holy and highest you could say it almost does the opposite as what like I said a kind of Evangelical would do because the kind of Evangelical thinking would be like yeah put Jesus in there as much as possible it's like just throw them in and so in some sense it's it's particular because you recognize the value or the a certain hierarchy where it's like I I know what I'm doing is not in the same space as when you know I'm consecrating the Eucharist right it's just not at the same space and so I don't want to confuse that hierarchy by by let's say almost saying like you said if I it's almost I feel in what you're saying it's like if I brought Jesus into my songs all the time it would come and almost be like blasphemy like maybe not blasphemy but it would be like like a demeaning to what the highest part of that is it's our songs are not Sacred Space yeah to do something to bring something into that like and I've said this before in other places but I don't typically talk about things that I really love I keep I keep those things for myself they're private you know the things musically the things I really love I don't want to talk to other fans of the bands that I like because you can't possibly love them the way I do kind of thing um and so I think in some ways you know I'm I'm terrible as far as being Evangelical because I don't really want to talk about price to people um you know it sounds weird as a priest to say that but like I don't you know I want to or even the theatokus like that you know good example like I don't want to talk about her to other people um unless we share it in a communal kind of space a Sacred Space the space of a church or in that setting in a band it seems like the worst possible idea to bring that into that setting to me anyway I'm sure you got comments someone else on this question I I it's funny because every time this comes up um I think I'm becoming more convinced like I have answers and I'm like I don't have any clue how to answer the question or how to untie the knot it's and that kind of occurred to me more recently how do you even answer this it's you know I almost wonder what the question is anymore what do we you know what do we do with it I I mean I got guitars on the wall and I still I'm like I'm in my classic so it's sort of like like Father Chris said there's that tension um maybe maybe in some ways as a priest the rock and roll part of our life is like dinner on the dining room table versus you know offering and this may not be the best way to put it but offering the Eucharist on the holy table you know the two are connected um who is it though I think it's father Thomas hopco would talk about the connection between you know the fellowship meal you share a coffee hour or the common meal after liturgy versus the Eucharist they're not opposed they're connected but there's but there's a clear very clear difference and um the things that we might um do and say around the meal that we have at the common meal after liturgy um hopefully we'll reflect what we've done in the Eucharist and won't contradict it but you know maybe we'll you know we're not it won't be as ritualized it won't be as um it'll be sacred but sacred as an informed sacred uh reshaped by the by the by the true thing the real thing and you know that meal that meal being an image of the greater meal marriage being an image of the true marriage you know whatever it might be in rock and roll is an uneasy it's an uneasy fit and yeah it's like there's this compulsion you know when you've you've done it for all these years you know to keep I mean I'm surrounded by it here I when I went to Seminary it was funny like the first time I ever did this because I was much worse about taking other people's gear than I was giving it up but people left it around there's like this rule that if you leave your gear sitting for so many minutes you know it's it's mine you know uh people we used to have a uh in the movie what what's that that's stealing it's still yes but let's call it you know let's let's gloss it here in the movie we talked about the dish which was this you know all ages club that we ran that's a great story that I won't get into but people would leave their gear occasionally and they wouldn't go back and get it well it became ours when I went to Seminary the first time in my life I gave away here like I'm like I'm not gonna need this anymore I'm gonna you know I'm going to Seminary I'm gonna be a priest I saw some regrets about that because I thought you know that now now I probably owe more gear than I've ever owned in my life you know as a priest you know you give up these things you think it's going to become less a part of you but yet you're you know still a part of who you are but I think for myself I'm more concerned that you know will the the stuff or the music somehow misshaped the priesthood you know that's my primary concern like I'll be a priest and I'll be a priest who picks up a guitar and you know where's my street clothes to play a show once in a blue moon maybe but if that if that harms any of this stuff in any way then I I need to put that away so there's that that tension of like you know is it crossing a line is it doing something else but um but like well like I said I'm not I don't even know if that's an answer I guess for myself I just keep making music and that's the best I can do at this point hmm so maybe that's the next question in terms of we won't name any names but I mean has that happened have you felt like you've received criticism or that people have questioned you know the the your your priesthood or question the the fact that your pastors of churches because of this I'll say first since I brought it up I've not had that actually I've been I kind of feel like people should so you know I mean I feel the same way you know I mean I feel like I've when we when I became a priest like immediately I let people know because I because of the internet I'm like what guys you're gonna get to know me you're gonna go on YouTube You're Gonna See videos here's here's some of my past history don't be shocked by this and my folks have always been just like they think it's super cool and I'm kind of like maybe you shouldn't I don't know I you know maybe it's not bad I don't know you get put into a category you become the cool priest yeah you know yeah it feels equally as uncomfortable totally totally well it's funny I mean my funny story about this is you know the movie was hitting all of these Art House cinemas around the country so it was coming to the local Cinema here and I was just nervous to talk about it to my parishioners I mean people know about the band and all of that finally somebody pulled me aside and said father you need to announce that this is coming because I think people would be disappointed if if they know that it came and and you didn't tell anybody so the very first time I've ever mentioned the band like from the ambo or whatever it was like announcements after liturgy and I just said well some of you know that I'm in this band and everybody just started laughing because like everybody knows that but I've never acknowledged it like publicly I said well this movie's coming some of you might be interested and I don't know the place was sold out and most of the people that were there were my parishioners yeah you know so the Q a afterwards it was just weird it just felt so awkward but it just it's somehow integrating at the same time so maybe maybe Father David this is a question for you in in some ways I mean maybe for all all of you uh because in some ways I can see like the trying to figure out how it connects hoping maybe they connect somehow but have you seen a difference in for example the themes either musically or in terms of lyrics that as you've matured in your own lives in your own spiritual lives and your own priesthood have you noticed that there has been a change in the type of themes that you're addressing or or even just the depth of of what you feel like you're able to touch in terms of of themes yeah well I mean definitely things have changed um but like I have a right now I'm working on a just a very short little EP that I hope to release before the end of the year um it's just home recordings and Father James and father Chris are going to help me with it but like one of the titles of one of the songs is my eyes are up here um which is typically referring to you know women with her features and you're looking at her features have been through her face so I love that phrase and and I'm using I'm converting that into a more something to do with like spiritual versus carnal kind of kind of language I'm using it in a different way so in that sense yeah like I'm still I like to use provocative themes and ideas even language um but I'm I think I've all you know pretty much for the entirety the band almost you know I've been living at an orthodox lifestyle so like I've always sort of tackled some of these themes in an orthodox with an orthodox sort of mindset so as as I've gotten to be you know been a priest last you know 10 years now there are definitely things certain things I won't say because it's just it's too far it push it goes beyond the uh you know the um Beyond The Pale sort of thing um but I still like to push and provoke so um but yeah what do you hope that what do you hope that does like what is that that's messing with people I mean just you know I don't know I don't like I my my interaction with music is all about it's very it's just personal it's like thank you first I don't and I said this a movie I don't believe anybody who really likes the music that we do even if they tell me they do like I don't really believe that first of all and I don't care ultimately I I it's really about the formation the creation of something that that wasn't there that that is now there which is why once it's done and it goes out into the world I don't pay any attention to it you know try not to re reviews I don't really care about playing live and all that kind of thing I just I really like about the creation of it and so um that's where all my attention is and if I have any tension it's during that process of saying well can I say this is this too far is this too complicated one of my solo records I use the you know I use the f word at one of my solo records a number of years ago and it was it kind of but it's very appropriate the usage of it you know and and it's it's uh I like to use language in that way um as a provocative kind of thing or these imagery images that are provocative um I don't know what the end I don't the end goal is with that I mean I really don't know it's just it's what you do it's rock and roll right so yeah yeah uh so that I think that the way that I the way that I've been seeing it or trying to kind of understand what what rock and roll could be because obviously it does from the very beginning right it's very associated with sensuality also emotion and anger you know all these things kind of coming together so it is a it's a passionate thing it's a very passionate thing and and so I was trying for a while to think about what like in terms of thinking of the idea of Christ feeling all things you know the idea of Christ kind of participating and all like what role could it be and I had this image of of Saint John The Foreigner like that's the image I had like there's something about being in the desert you know like I I can imagine Saint John The Foreigner in like uh like a heavy metal band right he's like he's out in the desert he's like screaming he's telling people to repent it's like it's more of that kind of get with it folks you know aren't why why aren't you seeing this like are you uh like it's not that that's not actually the the executive space of your band but this is like the image that I had that I thought like in terms of thinking of this idea of art of the north X or art of the of them out of the desert something like that something about that um anyway so that was the only that was the thing that I could that I could kind of see in my in my mind and the Aesthetics of rock and roll seem to fit even with that to a certain extent I think for me as The Lyricist like I I have always used um the method of asking the question as my primary um way of writing and maybe that's the way that the prophets would do it it wasn't it was more of like look at what you're doing you know look at this reality and it's not that now try not to give the answer so much and they talk about that in a movie a little bit like I'm not trying to hit people over the head with answers but it's just more of a look at what's going on look at this reality look at what's happening um and then beyond that the church has the answers that people want to come into the and find the answers this is where you find it maybe our role you know as musicians is to ask the questions and maybe I think that's a great I think it's a great formulation you know and it's a it is in some ways a formulation of it's like you could say something like as we as we stand in chaos it's there we stand outside we stand outside of the church then what is the for what is that what does that mean and that's it it's the question like it's like what about this Lord like what about this you know that's that that's the role of of the outside to a certain extent you know so that's I think that you really you hit that nail on the head there all music all good music kind of does that right I mean whether it's made by Christians or not that's what you know protest music was whether it involved a acoustic guitar or not you know it's all about asking a question look at what's going on so hmm so who who are would you say are your influences in terms of music and in terms of of writing brother okay um I don't like anybody I mean you know there are like very few things uh I was listening so again I'm working on this new project that I really all I listen to anymore these days really is just meals from I don't know you know who that is or not but he's just a composer um all all uh instrumental music and I find that the stuff that I'm writing is just basically trying to duplicate what he does um with vocals um historically uh obviously some of the Olympics are pretty obvious I mean I was a I was a huge Miss fan back in the day and I think I think Morrissey lyrically was the most most clever and most interesting there's also a big house Martins fan I think uh Paul Heaton and his writing was very interesting outside of music I always referenced T.S Eliot I come back to him uh all the time quite often and he can't get far in this day and age without referencing Radiohead in some way um either either somatically or sonically I think the songwriting especially is just super interesting um those are some of my you know lyrically and musically being the songwriter that's where I'm kind of coming from father Chris and Father James have their other textures they add to that but what about you Father James father Christopher um I was at one time I was really into YouTube I think they're kind of boring now but I loved them when I was in high school and that was really that got me into the the sound like the sound of things the atmospheric quality of things but then my brother and father Chris got to college and father Chris introduced us to like the DC Punk scene so Washington DC had this Punk scene and and there was just this energy this Vitality to that that was totally different than a lot of the like I was I was hugely into like the new wave movement and the 80s I love that stuff and you know synthesizer and stuff I still love it I I write that kind of stuff but um but the the punk scene particularly things bands like fugazi or I loved a band called shutter to think they just were poetically bizarre and they the the lyrics were were um impressionistic and made very little sense but it was just really really beautiful in terms of the way the guy wrote and it was very influential on me in terms of guitar playing because the guitar the early records it was really scattered and kind of interesting but then like the way the way the singer um Craig sang and just bizarre lyrics were were in a good way um just kind of influenced kind of how I thought about writing guitars because you know my brother writes you know he's he probably at the time we started I was probably writing I was writing a lot I guess I was writing a lot of them it was a band we were but I was writing a lot of the music still but then he learned how to play the guitar and he plays better than I do so he started writing stuff but then he uses these weird chords like a seventh what's a suspense you know what's a C Major Seventh I don't know what that is I play power chords so I have to learn I I was challenging kind of the way and I still do I think the melody you know not so that kind of influenced how how I was doing it just play my Chords it's not gonna happen I mean it just won't work I can't do that I'm not doing it Rebel so that's what I did what I do yeah and as they said I mean I was very influenced by kind of the underground Punk scene of the 80s and early 90s and uh I would say I was more influenced kind of ideologically in some respects of just kind of this do-it-yourself you know we're gonna start our own band start our own venue and then music was all just a part of that using music as a means for just making change um so certainly fugazi and all of those bands I think musically I just love the the energy and the you know as a bass player just the almost like jazz influenced um a little bit uh and then certainly I got into jazz as well but uh yeah Radiohead and certainly I loved you two and I always loved Adam Clayton's uh bass playing and um yeah which is funny because we don't sound anything like that I don't think yeah yeah well I think I mean when I I listen to your the early albums like I mean it really did sound like like the 90s in its own way I mean it had it had its own sound but it still had that you could you that Vibe I don't know allows to to describe it so what about now because you're working on an album Now what is how do you feel that how that's going how different is is it how similar is it to what you've done before that's your job brother oh it's so hard it's so hard nowadays um like we you know we I wrote a bunch of songs uh over the last few years um and we've gotten together a number of times to try to sort of work them out to see how we how we would put them put them together and it just it hasn't it just didn't work repeatedly it just it ended up sounding just not interesting and so probably not bad but just not interesting and so um I kind of went back to the drawing board and just took all the songs and just redemoed them in in a totally different fashion using a lot of keyboards and our page eaters and things like that um and I said okay let's just try to record them like let us do it this way and it seems like it's kind of work a lot better um it's very much less Democratic less banned like uh and father Chris will tell you as he's recording his baseball I'm standing over him going no no no don't do it that way change that into the drama the same way I was sitting right in front of his Kick Drum and I'm like no no that's a bad feel do it this way you know not that I play problems or anything like that benevolent dictator yeah and then my brother putting down guitars like yeah he'd spend 10 hours working on something I don't like that try something else so um so you're the dictator of this project right now it's gonna be you know good or bad it's going to be sort of my vision for things and so we have a hierarchy within the bands right I think you know for me I'm just not interested in repeating the stuff we've done in the past and then so I think the new stuff is it's weird it's different from us in the sense of there's a lot of Dancy stuff going on which is you know not a Dancy band um but there's some just it's just gonna be different I think which again in terms of songwriting that's what's interesting to be just not repeating the same thing so hmm all right so good I mean I was gonna say like I was gonna I was gonna bring it to to my to my last question which might be in some ways hard considering the discussion that we've had already but so like I said there's I know there's a lot of artists that watch my content a lot of people who are many of them are post-secular the best way to explain it they they kind of come out they're actually went very much into a secular world into the secular art world but then became disillusioned and now you know our let's say Christian adjacent or actually going to church or a catechum in somewhere or whatever you know people kind of floating around and they everybody's trying to figure out how to do this right how to how to live the their lives for in a fulfilling way especially because a lot of them are are professional like they do it as a living like how to live their artistic lives and also you know move towards Christ uh and so do you have something to to advise these people like is there something that what would you say if someone like came to you in your own parish and had those questions you know um can I can I jump in is that all right yeah um again I feel like I want to say this quickly because I don't I don't have I feel like I don't have the answer anymore which is kind of good but I keep thinking about before before I went to Seminary I was a Furniture Builder and um and how much when I became Orthodox in the midst of that like in that period of my life the furniture was still the furniture but something had changed like I I was realizing like how much that can become you know I mean your Nikon Carver so you understand an iconographer often knows you know that should be an act filled with prayer but suddenly whatever you're going to do whether it's you know building furniture for a living or or making art which in my mind in a lot of ways are there there's a lot of connection there um I mean it's it's something that has to be filled with prayer I mean I don't know how everything our whole life is supposed to be filled with prayer if you're an Orthodox Christian and you want to do things I feel like I'm kind of skirting the question you you want things to be good in terms of your output you're a musician you're trying to square um Orthodoxy in a sense with rock and roll or whatever it might be I mean all you can do is is offer it you know it's either it's blessable or it isn't and um for myself it's always been we said before it's been attention I didn't know what to do with it uh I still kind of don't know what to do with it except for the fact that it's sort of like it's the natural thing to do you know I I've I admit I'm you know I will be probably a musician who makes on my own you know rather mediocre music until I die it's a natural output of me whether it's something that's totally Eternal or not I don't know the best I can do is say here it is and then offer it in a sense with a prayer praying that it's something that's that's worthy and that God can somehow uh make use of it um maybe I read a story maybe some of you read the book scent of Holiness um it just comes to my mind that in this book and that again I don't know how good or bad this is but in this book it there's a tale of a monk and I think it's I've seen other places who comes in the monastery and he's this goofy guy he doesn't really have anything to offer the monastery and another Monk sees him one night doing like gymnastic tricks in the church and at the end of it he's he falls down before the icon of Christ and he just says I'm sorry Christ this is all I got I'm no good at anything else but I was a clown before I became a monk and this is what I've got to give you and of course the other Monk Is scandalized and as The Story Goes he brings another monkey and they spy on him doing these gymnastic tricks in the church at night when no one's there and they're there to basically kind of clamp down on him except for the fact that the end of this one particular evening he falls in for the icon of Christ Christ himself appears and wipes the sweat from his brow and says you know thank you for your offering and the other two monks are Shattered by this like wow okay we you know this is bizarre but this is what Christ is has um chosen to do for the us now whether this is true or not I don't know but for me when I hear that story I think okay well maybe that's it right there maybe there's something to be said for that um does that help people I don't know but I I mean for myself there's that tension and maybe I'm just I'm a clown you know I mean that's all I can do is jump around I don't know again I don't think I've got the answer but that's what comes to me when we talk about these things for what it's worth is that too weird I mean I don't know I've kind of come to the the same place that you know I I don't know if if it's something to figure out yeah other than it just you know kind of embrace the the tension of it and you're you're wanting to bring your Christ into every area of your of your life and so you know we don't have the this dichotomy or these little like segregated parts of our life as Orthodox Christians it's all one life and so we just want to offer up all of our life whether we're in church whether we're at our job whether we're in the recording studio um it's kind of I I think it's Abba Moses I can't remember which uh desert father is but you know talks about stay in your cell and it will teach you everything and so I think kind of our cell is just whatever we've been given whatever our obedience is whether it's our job it's our the talents we've been given whether one is a priest icon Carver um you know and just I guess just seek to bring that presence of God into the midst of everything that we that we do I don't know we we'd also you know we need to remember that Christ is the perfect example of all of this right right so his ministry was three years long but his whole life you know as a carpenter um was he like carving crosses and giving them to people you know probably not that would have been a weird time but you know his his whole reality would have been offered up to the father as a prayer and he and because he's Christ he does everything perfectly which means it's perfectly humble right so when people come to me and they say yeah I'm thinking about doing this thing or whatever I'm like great do it and do it as well as you possibly can because when you do that they get well be prideful about it tell you what if it's actually done well it'll be done in the image of Christ and it'll be perfectly humble it'll be a great offering um and that's you know like Father Chris said I don't think there's necessarily it's not a problem like Christ doesn't call us to be Bankers or artists or lawyers or Housewives he calls bankers and artists and lawyers and Housewives to be disciples that's what he calls um so whatever you do do it as well as you possibly can it'll be a good icon um and if it's bad art it probably stems from Bad theology get your theology corrected I remember at one point um after becoming Orthodox I've been Orthodox for a couple of years and I was in a I've been in a number of bands but I well a couple of bands and the other band I was in other than luxury which was a band called they sing as a slew um we were playing shows and we were playing shows a lot of shows on Saturday nights and I was I was feeling really conflicted with this and and I so I would go to Vespers and I would leave there and we'd go drive you know not terribly far away and play play a show one night I was playing at some actually nearby place so I was talking to the priest after to our priest father Jacob after service and I just said ah I'm like you know I gotta go play the show this is dingy little club and so I just feel so weird about it coming to Vespers and he said well like my brother said he said do good just do it well play well you know offer it well and and that actually really put my my mind at ease in fact we played really well that night because I went with sort of a a piece and I didn't feel like I had to like make this an orthodox event for the people I just simply took what I had at Vespers went picked up my guitar and played a show and tried to offer it to the Lord and that was that's what we did Holy Spirit was really moving really all right well Father David Father James father Christopher thank you so
