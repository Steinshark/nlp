ladies and gentlemen we have a massive update in the cheating scandal here in late 2023 in the Chess World which features prominently Grandmaster and former world champion Vladimir kramnick uh originally also hikara Nakamura uh beloved streamer top three Grandmaster in the world now chess.com is getting involved uh and also this video is coming out on Christmas Eve here in America and Christmas in certain parts of the world so Merry Christmas uh if you are celebrating uh sending nothing but health and happiness uh to uh to everybody frankly around the entire world uh also we reopened the merch store for Christmas so if you want to pick up Hoodie you missed that uh merch store is reopened until the end of the year and I've got a Christmas uh little courses sale going on but that's all out of the way first uh because we got to get into it we really got to get into it this is going to be a pretty wild update video I'm going to talk a lot as always you are going to get a drama update on this channel if there is drama in the Chess World but I'm going to try to give you an unbiased uh realistic take about the situation where I explain everything that is sort of the motto as much as everybody likes to make fun of the fact that you know chess drama does get featured quite frequently okay number one today chess.com posted a statement that said Grandmaster Vladimir karnick is one of the greatest chess players of all time and we have enormous respect for him as a player we met with karnick numerous times to discuss his fair play concerns we established direct communication between him and our Fairplay team to provide an appropriate and expedient venue for discussion our team carefully investigated many dozens of players about which karnick raised suspicions in the vast majority of the cases we found his accusations baseless interesting point by the way already vast majority they didn't say all the cases which I don't know if that's just you know smart PR or what but unfortunately crnic has continued to make his accusations public using his profile and blog on chess.com this not only violates chess.com terms of service but also Fay the international governing body of the game their code of conduct kik's escalating attacks against some of the most respected members of the chess community and some of its most promising young talents interesting can no longer be ignored consequently we have now closed kck's blog and muted his account we have always and will always welcome thoughtful criticism and discussion such as we have had with many top players for years around the very real challenge of cheating and chess cnick can still reach out to us privately through email other communication platforms to discuss this suspicions and concerns that is a pretty big statement by chess.com it's a pretty big decision uh karnick is not banned he's not banned on chess.com but he is his blog is muted all right now I have a couple of his blog posts pulled up we will go through them in a moment then we will talk about some of those young talents uh that were mentioned uh we're also going to talk about Kick's response we're going to talk about responses to this thing it's going to be a big update video this of course all stems from a couple of weeks ago when basically Vladimir kramnick uh started posting about the fact that Hikaru Nakamura has had many uh statistical anomaly streaks on ch.com and then karnick said in multiple subsequent posts that he had evidence to knock Hikaru out and then he said that there was a major negative PR campaign going against him that was saying he was accusing hikaro when he wasn't accusing hikaro he was just drawing more attention uh to the necessity of basically nobody being Above the Law and chest and I already made many videos about this so first of all yanomi literally just responded this is of course the two-time Challenger to the World Chess Championship and he said yes maybe karnick goes ahead and does not mince his words but your platform cannot cope with cheating as they say accepting as Pro problem a problem is the first step to solving it try this instead of sanctioning one of the best players in history um listen this is a very strong statement and then he elaborates on it further by responding to an individual in the Chess World and says um BL you know many of these players keep farming title Tuesday has a part-time job so the big issue here is that Yan pishi who is pretty tongue and cheek with the way he speaks uh and the way he tweets Yan is basically insinuating and I and I I don't think he's the only one a lot of top chess players think a lot of other top or let's say top 100 players in the world who are 2600 ELO are cheating online and if they're cheating online in today's day and age with modern technology there might be a chance that they begin cheating over the board as well like this this is essentially the argument that's the argument I think and I don't know if we're going to get to a place where we can confidently say or or or not say that that something is going on but this is just the beginning I mean if you look at the quote tweets on this thing um I don't know how to even do that I guess I have to click on it and then I have to I got to click on the tweet and then I man they really messed up Twitter man so chess drama never stops uh his account has been muted uh Grandmaster har Krishna listen saying good decision credit to him you know he's coming right out and and and saying something um Anish giri uh tweeted some sort of joke about it he didn't really want to I I said oh boy that was that was my big Insight leavon aronian said somehow I feel uh that Chom is becoming everything they claimed they weren't before the merger I love Danny as a person but the whole trend is making me sad leevon is a very wise man he says a lot of good things he's very insightful very smart level-headed for the most part in this particular instance I disagree with this I don't think the merger has anything to do with this decision um also the handbook that is mentioned Fay's code of conduct like the code of conduct says that false accusations are a serious violation and it's an abuse of freedom of expression that is prohibited by the disciplinary code which basically says players are members of their delegations must not make unjustified accusations right like at the end of the day cheating in chess is a very very big problem but approaching it we have not figured out the right way to approach it because right now it's just basically like passive aggressive stuff on social media Levon on the other hand you know says I love Danny as a person hold trend is I again I it's weird because Dany it's not like Danny wrench this is very important Danny wrench is not sitting in a dark office somewhere deciding to mute karnick like that's not what's happening here at the end of the day karnik is using a very public blog on a chess website to attack other people who chess.com themselves have proven uh or or or or not proven but just straight upset or not cheating right like that that that is that is the situation now I can I can understand the Optics that the service to the game like you know chess belongs to the public and this is not like you know it's not like chess.com is a website that sells shoes or Goods like it's not the same thing so so censoring a top player is like a bad Optical look but that's not really what's going on in this case in any case karnick responded said dear chess fans in accordance with my expectations chesc platform took another step in trying to shut me up and un recently block my blog on their platform the right to comment publicly about anything there uh I did not receive any responses to my statistics Publications email to my complaints about direct threats from Members right karnick received haters and his messages that wrote really disgusting things and I did mention that already extremely disrespectful attitude toward the former world champion coupled with an unwillingness etc etc I mean it's just completely normal stuff you can pause and read it and then he said I'm going to open a Facebook account uh which I'll report in the next couple of days big big you know again cuz like this is not chess.com blog is not really the only place you can post about this stuff now uh this is Kick's account um and I uh I was actually unable uh to look at any of these blogs because they're muted so I had to have staff screenshot them for me so like I had to I had to go in and I I basically needed staff to screenshot the blogs uh from like a previous uh you know instance which I which which is which is quite interesting uh because there was no other way to do that because it was muted so this all kind of began you know this was a while back uh uh this is right around when the tournament in Toronto started Champions chess tour so I hadn't updated anything and basically kramnick said you know lately I see a lot of inter internet media resources discussing well-known story most of them are afraid to invite me or at least contact me and ask me questions a lot of manipulations direct lies in the dirty PR campaign and he said he offered major chess YouTubers like myself C Square chess bra which I thought was very funny because bra has an H in it invite me for a conversation on their Channel where I promise to refute most of the arguments the opposite side use so uh he did go on chess bra uh Eric Hansen interviewed him yesterday actually for about three hours and then uh karnick also went on dojo talks I think he called it he didn't call it interviews coming he called it interview with a free media platform it's just a YouTube CH I mean it's not like you know this is like free media I thought about this um and uh I I again I might change my mind but I basically made the decision that I don't if I invited Vladimir to speak on this channel which is the biggest chess YouTube channel that's publicly audited by you you the viewer I'm not sure we would uncover anything unique like at the end of the day this really just strikes me as a situation where Vladimir has an opinion about about the methods used in the anti-che uh the mathematics the statistics uh everything ch.com puts out a statement karnick is not satisfied so I like there is no addition that I can make I mean I can invite him for the views and I can ask him some questions but at the end of the day just like you'll see like in the ches barar interview we didn't really discover anything new Vladimir basically just says a lot of people talk behind the scenes like you saw Yan I think there is a very strong sentiment at top level chess about people in the Chess World I think there's a lot of behind closed doors private conversations that happen a lot of Suspicion of cheating definitely online more than over theboard because it's a lot harder to do over the board but if I invited karnick for a conversation we wouldn't get anywhere okay because he doesn't agree with the way chess.com does stuff and probably historically there is some accuracy to that for sure like a player can go up the ranks for a long time and then at some point Point have one big event like where he beatss Magnus or Hikaru and then he gets in trouble I don't know how accurate that is but that's just the reality so I thought like look I can invite karnick because I'm view hungry but to be honest with you I'm not sure there's going to be any productive conversation because I'm going to ask him certain questions he's going to give the same answers that he's given and that's the reality um but he did do a couple of interviews and um then he started posting again um and this is where things got bad this where things got bad so I appreciate your patience this is where things got a little bit bad um I'm going to close out a couple of these uh tabs here he said I'm going to present a few posts one by refuting the nonsense manipulation spread in vast amounts by different sources okay he's going to point to blunders in the so-called research of the chess.com statement um as to the allegations about hikaru's incredible performance we've looked at the statistics our team has done the math in various simulations we have found that that not only is a 45 game winning streak possible it's in fact likely okay to calculate correct math probability of certain streaks you must calculate precisely the total number of such streaks average rating difference in each to calculate uh math probability within a period of time total amount of games played by a player those streaks were performed and take only games played with the same time control okay it's obvious classical chess rapid and three without increment and bullet are very different in nature how can this world's best anti-cheating system fail to understand that you can't mix it together when examining the streaks based solely in 3 minute games which immediately decreases the amount of games by a good 40% funniest thing is particularly in this research doesn't even matter much how can they mathematicians publishing discoveries fail to understand that those winning streaks probability fully depends on the total number of games played during this period and not altogether um basically Vladimir is saying that the way chess.com either calculated or talked about calculating something uh um is inaccurate they did they took the wrong amount of games they took again just arguing right like the he's just saying that's they didn't do it the right way okay well I maybe he's right and maybe he's completely wrong but if they do do it the right way will he admit that he's completely wrong will he admit there's not something go you know so I can give you you know imagine you must calculate the probability of Real Madrid scoring three games uh three goals in a match with Barcelona right um so you know he keeps saying was it a joke will they keep the Royal silence um dear Danny and Eric because even a basic school education is enough to understand how incompetent the explanation of this is do you understand a such statement can make people with develop critical thinking doubt about chess.com anti-cheating measures after this I feel I have even more rights demanding from the platform something which would at least remotely REM remind a proper anti-cheating examination um crazy right crazy stuff crazy stuff um I again like I'm reading this and I'm not I don't know what to think this this is one of the reasons I'm I'm hesitant about the whole inviting kikon because I like I'm not I'm not ever sure we're going to level I'm not ever sure I'm not sure we're ever going to get to a spot where he's just like oh I accept the methodology that is used by the fair play Team okay great you know and I'm going to stand down we're in too deep I mean Vladimir himself in multiple blog posts said that he had a lot of mounting evidence against Hikaru like and then he's trying to again from the beginning I have said everybody respects Vladimir Kick's accomplishments in the Chess World everybody but once you start going down this path in fact some of the things that he said about title Tuesday and everything like that in the past about potential cheating and priz money events we for the most part could understand and agree with but once you start doing stuff like this it you're going to lose a little bit of that credibility now this is where it got real bad all right and this is the this is the the major major thing if you're uh if you have the attention span you made it this far um he started posting about farming and um you know because there was a big discussion about farming people like 20 games in a row at a certain ELO um so he started mentioning stuff about farming uh you know we can we we we can we can potentially discuss and address and whatever but um this is uh then he kept going all you need to know about anti-cheating um you know major logical mistake followed by the conclusion it's an obvious logical fallacy so mathematicians what did you examine etc etc but then crck started posting accounts this these are more screenshots karnick started posting accounts I will present another player to today and continue with a frequency one a day after one a day after one a day after he's going to start posting One account on chess.com every single day and he wants to talk about this guy this guy is a 12-year-old boy from Turkey okay he's top 10 he's he's s and 11 against taru something haven't seen in chess history at this age none of the future world champions at age 12 could compete on almost equal terms with the role players I find it hard to believe but ch.com seems to have another opinion okay now this is where it gets weird this is where it gets uncomfortable this is where it gets bad okay just like in the Hans nean situation right once you start saying 12-year-old prodigies need to be investigated one of two things is happening either you are completely Incorrect and you have falsely accused a future star of the game which happens actually pretty frequently in chess over the last 5 to 10 years there are suspicions as you can see from top players about players all over the world because the internet in my opinion has bridged that Gap the traditional gap between how long it used to take a junior player to get really really strong now kids can play online playing tens of thousands of games all the time right like and it it's very simple Blitz bullet so either you are just accusing a future Prodigy and potential discrediting them or hurting their career or the young Prodigy is a cheater right like again it's binary like they're in chess you're either a cheating or you're not cheating now in this particular case with uh erdogmus is his name yagis a Turkish kid look at his statistics I will show them to you first of all this young man plays very well against hikaro this is his feay page by the way adorable 2500 very strong in alltime controls born in 2011 11 by the way completely nuts and he just played a tournament in sedus where he got a GM Norm uh you can't see his results because the overlay is really ugly and also I'm covering it but look at his performance rating 2608 so this young man gains 17 Fay points and got a GM Norm that's his first GM Norm okay this young man who will probably be a Grandmaster by the end of 2024 like that's who kramnick posted about now kramnick could potentially find people that that that are more likely to be cheating like ch.com obviously and Hikaru himself obviously do not find or Dogma suspicious like because hikaro has made a video about this young man and and Turkey by the way you have a chess Prodigy celebrate but but but this is wild if karnick is going to just start posting one a day that's really bad but the argument here is is it bad because cheating is an issue we don't talk about at all in chess and like everything is kept silent like the Hans nean thing remember my friends the Hans nean thing Hans nean did an interview when all of that blew up and Hans nean said well I you know I did it twice online when I was a teenager and meaningless games but no but but the thing is like that's the issue in the Chess World is that none of that stuff is publicized except in a little bubble there's a little bubble of top level chess players that for some reason like no and don't know all of this online stuff and all this online lore there this is a major problem in the Chess World major major major major problem how about this do you remember a couple of months ago there was a post this was you know K this was on Reddit and he was posting the average accuracy of players and look at number one lvic right the best player by this is rapid games online Dennis lavic Fu mvl all these guys lavic was here and you start looking at these posts and this is lvic and you may remember Dennis lavic just played in the Champions chess tour finals and chess.com clearly does not think that Dennis lazovic is cheating in fact Danny wrench asked Dennis lavic about this in an interview like loic's legit he's legit he just he had a very different growth his growth was primarily online just like potentially that young Turkish kid etc etc so this is the real issue like the real issue is it's multi-layered um cheating and chess is 100% an issue and I firmly believe I firmly believe that if a very strong grandmas ranked 70th in the world or let's say 40th in the world cheats a tiny bit in prize money events it's almost impossible to catch but somebody told me something recently somebody told me something recently that made me reconsider they they made me reconsider something they said that person that I'm describing will cheat and they will get away with it a couple of times for sure but which cheaters don't get away with it multiple times and which cheaters stop when they successfully cheat and that was interesting that made me reconsider a lot because I was sitting there for a long time even in these videos going cheating is a problem in chess if a top player masks their cheating intelligently they're never going to get caught yes if it's done in a tiny sample size but if somebody is a successful cheater they're probably going to cheat again that made me reconsider that made me go you know what that's true any athlete anybody in any Walk of Life right if you cheat in a competition and you get away with it you're not just going to stop right like that's the truth I for the most part some do until you get punished if you get punished you get two-year Bann whatever in sports then you might stop but until you get until you get in trouble it's very difficult to just stop because you see this and that made me think you know what maybe it just requires a little bit of time but as you can see from npom Nishi and a lot of other players that will not speak out publicly I think cheating is a very very serious threat to chess particularly if it can move from online to over theboard if people start figuring out a way to get around anti-cheating measures I mean I don't even know what to say the anti-cheating devices used in Toronto at the chess.com Global Championship cost $40 to $50,000 chess tournaments don't have that type of money chess tournaments don't even have enough staff okay to pay a daily wage preventing over theboard cheating in chess outside of like the top five tournaments in the world are is basically impossible that's basically impossible and that is the real problem now does chess.com need to start communicating with Fay I don't know I don't know and one last inconsistency in all of this one last inconsistency in all of this this statement says the violation of the FED code of conduct right I just showed you false accusation and the Fay handbook right here however it was determined in the case of Magnus and Hans that I don't really know what was determined in that case with Magnus withdrawing and then they're not being enough evidence technically with in that sinkfield cup game the the historic one right Magnus was fine €10,000 that was the punishment he was not suspended because I guess they were like well Hans has this on line history so and that's the truth I think we're living in a reality in the Chess World where nobody's going to get in trouble for basically saying anything about anybody else I don't know how on Earth they're going to enforce this because if you look at what karnick is doing right now yes he is bringing to the Forefront that people could be potentially be cheating online and he might even be right he might even be correct if karnick brings us 10 names two are cheating and eight are not like right but even if it's 50/50 like even if it's 50-50 five people and then five people he accuses incorrectly I is that something we're worth living with like you got to put people who are guilty in a guilty situation but you need to do it with like 99.99% certainty that is just that com's job you can't have 10 people and you go I think they're all cheaters but five of them turn out to not be in five right so that's the real issue here I don't think anybody's going to be getting in trouble for any of this um in in uh in the US chess Federal there was some case in Florida recently where for false cheating accusations somebody was suspended 2 years that's never happening nobody is going to punish karnick nobody's going to punish Magnus they might P punish like a 2500 level grandmas that's the truth I'm telling you the truth it's what I think if if if a if a 900th ranked player in the world accuses somebody and nobody's ever heard of them like they're going to get in trouble these top no they're not going to get they're not going to get in trouble for the most part it's it's just that's just how it is and again it it it's it's it's a very messy situation because on the one hand I completely agree that this is an issue I completely agree that the Integrity of online tournaments and potentially over theboard tournaments could be in a crisis if we don't find a way to figure this out uh on the other hand uh this is a this is a wild situation it's a wild situation uh crck can't post on ch.com anymore for violating codes of uh terms of service and potentially code of conduct and Kick's not even totally wrong in his like entire big picture about cheating I think he's just approached it the wrong way but if you ask me what the right way is I'm not to be honest I'm I'm just I don't know like I I really don't know because in chess we have chess.com we have Fay we have le chess like we we just have massive massive entities that kind of don't really communicate and if somebody gets banned they can play somewhere else and so that's the situation uh Merry Christmas so we'll we'll see what happens from here uh until then get out of here
