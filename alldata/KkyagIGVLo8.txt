I am a long time Vim user and I have made many videos on this channel over the course of the last three years about them and why it's a superior experience to every other text editor on the planet and for the most part I'll stand by that I think that them movements are probably the best way to move around text period completely agree great great this is this is absolutely 100 percent correct I don't think that there's a better way out there it's just I think that's fact and while I know that there are people who disagree with me there's a bunch of Helix users right now seething and coping so hard you'll see the thing about Helix is it's written in Rust and it has an LSP already yeah yeah it's great trust us no don't care don't care Helix Helix Deez Nuts okay people are obviously wrong then movements are awesome and they should be in every single application ever anything that has to do with text or moving the screen up and down whatever should happen but recently I've been doing something weird now for the last three years you've been hearing me say that I'm not a developer and I'm not a developer I don't ever have plans to be an actual developer I'm not going to ever get paid for development work and I think that that's kind of the threshold you need in order to actually be considered a developer but I something that's always confused this is not the first person I've ever met that's really into Linux but doesn't necessarily want to be a developer I'm always a little bit curious about that right I've always been really curious about how does that happen I have been learning python for a few months now and I've been getting back into HTML and CSS I've been learning some jobs bless us all script for some projects that I've been working on for for my personal projects and stuff so I've been using or I've been coding quite a bit lately I should say and I've been using Vim somewhat to do that okay the more that I use them to code the less I like it now I know what you're thinking Matt you okay I'm I'm feeling a little emotional I'm feeling a little I'm feeling a little emotional right now okay the more that I use them to code the less I like it now I know what you're thinking Matt you're a Vim Fanboy how can you possibly say that them which is primarily a coding tool is not great for coding well first off all right first off I don't think you guys are letting him cook okay sometimes we let bro cook sometimes the kitchen burns down but sometimes you get a flaming young okay why is he saying this let him cook I'm not gonna say that it's not great for coding I'm sure that people who are more experienced with the tools that enable them to be good at coding are probably much more Adept at using them to doing that purpose for me I'm a Noob at all things but specifically in this I'm very much a noob and the tools that I've discovered to make them good at coding and development work and stuff like that don't feel very good to me now it doesn't mean that they're not good it just means that they don't really I haven't been able to adapt to the workflow that those tools are requiring of me I've tried many different cool so it's not just one of tools I've tried many different code completion things I've tried different plugins that allow for language management and stuff like that obviously you can tell from the lack of correct terminology there that I'm still very much a noob so you know I've done obviously I think it's really good though to hear out a new person talk about this uh just because it's really interesting to hear the perspective because I've been using Vim or Vim motions for over a decade so it's like I I it's it's hard for me to remember what it's like during the beginning of things you know what I mean it's very simple to just go oh it's easy but it's like I've also spent 33 percent of my life using Vim slash Vim motions you know what I mean you you you get kind of you get kind of abstracted from things quite a bit of research I've tried to find the best tools and the best plugins and stuff to enable them to be a good tool for my development work and it just hasn't kind of gotten There Yet now I had thought that I could get past this problem by abandoning my configuration file of neovim and adapt let's go Neil babe let's go let's go neovin let's go let's go drinking game continues what are the rules does he mention htmx and go or forgets to turn on alerts or says react sucks that's the three that's the three rules to the prime drinking game I think somebody else is to my workflow so for example I use nvchad for quite a while okay and that is a very well configured envymconfig that is meant to kind of transform it into an IDE and it's a very good one it has all the features that you want if and probably more features that you don't even know that you need yeah and more that you probably don't need it has a ton of features ton of plugins already baked in and the key bindings and all that stuff are saying and it works really well and it looks nice and it feels nice and all this stuff but I couldn't get into it all that much part of it is that I don't know a lot of Lua and that is a Lua config now I've been learning some Lua as I've been trying to by the way Lua is actually Lula is part of this Cult of simple that I've kind of been pretty excited about for the last while meaning that Lua is also an incredibly simple language and I feel like I've slept on Lua too much and I should probably like it more but there's always one thing that gets me with Lua there's one thing index one index one yep index one honestly if it wasn't index one I genuinely think the language would be better just straight up um we all use little DSL yeah dude Lewis great Lua is I'd say oh we use Lua as a configuration DSL for all of our services whole platform I think it's smart because Lu is super simple easy to embed and it's just like a it's it's a complex enough language to do everything you need get index one uh it's just like it does everything you need and so I like it and and having a language that's not complex means that you're just gonna avoid writing complex programs because they're virtually too hard to really do right like it's it's just super it's just like you can just you just tend to write simpler things you tend to think simpler you tend to write simpler I actually really like Lua more and more that I've used it and I don't mean that just because I like Brazilians which I do there's a Brazilian of you and I like all of you but dabbling in making new them and Vim better in this case new of him I should say I've been learning something or some Lua but I'm still not there yet I don't really care for that language so I have a mental block there so Envy Chad I I used it for a while and I just customize it as much as I could on my did someone just say VB is index one or zero how do you make a decision that's worse than index one how how do you make a decision worse than index one you make zero an option as well that this is not okay this is truly not okay oh and it was okay but it still didn't feel right so I tried lunar Vim which is another IDE configuration U of M it's kind of its own Fork at this point but it's Chris Chris App machine is very very talented uh I really like what he's done I think he has a lot of good things I'm happy about it still kind of the same thing like it's built up to be a IDE for many different languages to enable people to use it use any of them for coding and it too just did not feel right for my level of expertise which is not a very high level at all both of those Envy Chad and lunar Vim felt like they would be fantastic for people who knew what the hell they were doing but for me who's very much a noob it felt overwhelming there was too many features too many plugins which I'm sure whereas my own configuration file felt very incomplete and kind of patched together very Patchwork and felt like it was missing things and things didn't really go together and you know I had no clue how to piece things together like I was supposed to in order to get them to work the way it was supposed to in order to actually make it work well as an ID where and it's a really it's just it that's a really interesting observation I know like this is where Kickstarter I think really really makes a lot of sense like hey if you're listening to this uh the Linux cast if you're listening to this I really think Kickstarter could be super cool to look at kickstarters by uh TJ or Not by TJ TJ's contributed to it I forget who it's by uh let's see uh kick uh starter yeah Envy Envy Kickstart I forget who started it whatever it is but this thing is just like awesome right it's just a great experience and it's all it is is it's one single file to help you understand how to write a neovim and make it completely your own so instead of being like a lunar Vim or an NV chat where you get the whole kitchen sink you get a bajillion plugins you get everything all at once and now you're just trying to configure it you're trying to figure out everything at once instead it just is like okay let's just do a couple things and you can kind of go from there and figure out what you want and for me this is really really really really really really really really exciting I I just really like that I'm not okay Judo says I'm not exactly a Linux amateur but I will say that configuring neovim the first time around for a setup that's that's actually productive is kind of a journey it is that's it's a fair statement that's that's a very fair statement and I think you forget what it is someone's commenting on 500 lines remember uh seems overwhelming as a beginner yeah but look at how much of it is just comments right there's a lot of comments in here you know and there's an explanation almost on every single line right so it's actually pretty useful it's pretty exciting I really like Kickstarter I think it's it's it's a really great attempt at making things more um consumable the on the NVM or the Envy Chad and the lunar Vim side it just felt like their head there's way too much stuff and this is going to be a very bad comparison it felt like emacs to me emacs had has a lot of features that I don't ever need and therefore it feels like I am overwhelmed with if I'm not mistaken Chris ab machine even has some uh remaps that are similar-esque to to enums I still have some enum holdbacks right so when I'm here and I want to open up all files leader uh leader f or leader PF project file that's like that's just straight up do Max right it's just like it's kind of stuck in my head with emacs you know what I mean did I say eat them whatever okay same thing okay same thing emacs enum same thing all those features right it's not something that I feel comfortable with and that's kind of what Envy Chad whatever and lunar film felt like to me so I've been struggling with this now for probably three or four months basically I've been going back and forth between different configuration files other people's in my own I've been basically using my own recently mostly because I've basically abandoned the idea of creating my own NVM config for an IDE experience I've just been using it as is with a few of my previously used plugins so I've been struggling with this for a while and what I realized is is that unfortunately as much as I like them them is not going to be the the tool that I need to use if I'm going to continue to code as much as I have been recently and that saddened me quite a bit because like I said I am a Vim Fanboy I have been for at least six years now I've been talking about them constantly on this channel I know them in and out I I know a lot of them script you know I've put a lot of effort into my configuration file both adding and subtracting things trying to get to feel right and as much effort as I put into it because I love them and I want to stay with it I just can't get it there yet maybe someday I can when I have more experience with what I'm doing when I've unders when I understand the tools that go into actually being useful for this type of thing maybe he is heartbroken right now and I get that you know like I remember when I switched off of uh uh netbeans I was a little sad you know there is something that you know you develop a bond with a things you use you know what I mean that's why it's I mean that's the reason why all arguments and programming are stupid and useless tabs versus spaces four two eight uh Vim neovim emacs vs code like they're all actually kind of stupid arguments it's that we just develop these weird bonds of things and then there's also people that use Sublime which that I mean we can all agree they're strange right they're just they're just weird they're just weirdos you know what I mean uh but they're like atom users like what I mean then I'll be able to come back to them uh but right now I can't so I am leaving them that's basically the whole point of this video I am not I'm not going to be using them for coding or writing going forward no that doesn't mean I'm not I'm gonna go go uninstall neovm and never use it again if I need to do a quick edit in a configuration file neovim makes more sense than opening up a graphical text editor it just does but if I'm going to sit down for some coding when I'm going through my some of my classes when it comes to actually you know learning how to do python or HTML or css or anything hey good job taking some classes all right get strong well done well done you know it it takes some time I know vs code is coming we can we can feel it the things that I'm learning at the moment I'm going to be opening up a graphical text editor or an ID in this case he's struggling saying is he I don't think he could say the word via's code are you seeing this like he you could see the shame currently in his face with saying it right like he's just like gra it's a graphical text editor right you could just feel it coming out of him he's struggling he's struggling right and the one that I've chosen is one that I've made a video about before and that is Kate now I've chose I do I did it see that one coming this was a plot twist I think we could all agree none of us were ready for this moment but we got to do it all together at the same time what a great turnaround okay okay why Kate I honestly I've never used Kate I don't I honestly don't even know what Kate is pushing Kate for two reasons one it's really good and it has all the features that I need it has the LSP client integration stuff that I need and stuff like that even though I'm still very much learning what all that stuff is and how to use it it has all of the necessary tools that I need in order to learn without feeling comp you knew okay no way first off talking to a person named ligma tits off just feels weird for me okay I just want you to know that but second off how did you know did you pre-watch this video did you pre-watch this video is that saying Lig my lick my teets off or is a is a lick my teeth off like several people trying to race to see who can ligma teats better you know what I mean like there's definitely like two different interpretations we can go here you know what I mean it's a good question it's it's you know 200 iQ going on right here K develop is a KDE IDE Kate is just an editor okay David tietzelhoff yeah it's really deep man wow absolutely overwhelming now it is a KD project so it has a ton of options but I've been able to ignore those so it's not horrible in that regard also it works really really well so it handles large files so I can also use this for my writing which is good and the second reason that I chose it was because it's open source so I know a lot of people who are developers choose to use a tool called vs code it's from Microsoft it is proprietary now there is a fork of that I believe or something like that called vs codium I'm not exactly sure the relationship between vs codium and vs code I've downloaded it I tried it I didn't really care for it all that much it just felt too proprietary even though vs codium is open source and the man lives lifestyle I love this I actually love this take that he is willing to use he wants that false lifestyle right it felt too proprietary absolutely love that like I actually don't have necessarily a problem with proprietary uh I do like IntelliJ but I love that take I just it's just um I I know that's weird so for something to feel proprietary but it still did so I I decided not to use that and decided to use Kate it works well for my workflow even though it doesn't seem to let me set a theme and let it stay there for whatever reason I'm not sure why that's happening but the point is is that I've chosen Kate it works really well for all the things that I've been doing I've been doing a lot of bad scripting I've been doing python HTML and all that stuff I always feel bad seeing a lot of bash scripting right when I see a when I when I see too much bash scripting I just start feeling bad on the inside you know what I mean but you know I have a phrase and I think it's the right phrase which is a little bit of bash goes a long way did I comment on ricer.sh net no I've noticed this I I've chosen not to say anything a little bit of bash goes a long way sorry bad cop a lot a bit of bash is a bad decision a little bit of bash good decision I'll give you a good example right here I made a little test script right made a little test script right here look at that beautiful test script okay it runs all different servers with different configurations doing plow testing against each server and it does a whole bunch of combinations a little bit of Bash saved me a lot of time I can set it and walk away a little bit very nice a lot of bit no no bueno no bueno right no bueno a little bit of bash good and it just works fantastic and it fits the workflow for my current experience level now whether it will continue to do so as I get better at coding I don't know it's possible that as I learn more I'll outgrow this tool that's possible in which case I'll go find something different maybe then vs code will make more sense to me I don't know or if yes coding whatever it happens to be I'll make that decision in the future as of right now this has decided this has been perfect for my workflow but for writing and for coding and by the way he uses I3 based it's good no I have not been showing very many of my scripts that I've been writing in my classes on the channel I've been doing that for a reason because guys seriously my beginning python is atrocious I don't want to show it to anybody it's embarrassing it's really really bad uh so I don't show that that what you guys just saw on screen was a bash script and even that is not very good so I'm still very much a noob which is kind of the whole point of all this stuff I'm still kind of learning what the the best tool is for me and my you know use case and all that stuff so as of right now Kate is where I'm focusing my energy I'm learning it pretty good and it's just kind of worked fairly well for me when it comes to what I need to do so I'm leaving them behind now it's a kind of a sad day for me because I really like them I I will proselytize them if that's the right word I don't even know it's been a very long day and Vim is just a fantastic tool and I still oh here's another reason why I chose K I forgot it also has emotions so it has been motions built in and while I know that you can get a plug-in to get the emotions and them stuff inside of vs code it's built right into Kate and that's fantastic I think that that is a necessity like I said at the beginning so that's another reason so um I just remembered that I want to throw that in there it is a long day if I chose to leave neovim you know there's part of me that would die Max has the same problem for me that Envy Chad and lunar Vim have they have it has a ton of features and they're all in your interface immediately upon actually using it for the first time and you have to almost immediately know how to configure it if you want to change it even just a little bit so if for example with emacs and with them if you want to change a key binding you have to know how to do that inside of the configuration file if I want to know how to do that in K it's simple as going to a drop down menu and going to the options to do so that's it's really that simple and while I went through the pain of learning how to change key bindings and stuff instead of them I went through that journey of learning them I don't want to do that with emacs I really have no interest in learning less I'm already learning like four other languages all at the same time although I have more experience with h I agree with the lisp thing lisp is kind of like learning its own adventure like lisp is an island onto itself and so I feel like learning lisp is that would take that would be an experience for me to do you know what I mean I I know I get it people love lisp but it's still it is in a in itself its own Island whereas like if you learn C you're kind of already good at at at python or add JavaScript uh parasocial says GUI is better than config I don't think so I think you're nuts okay I genuinely do saying it's saying it's saying that is just crazy because we all know that when you do a GUI all you get is just one gigantic it's like trying to visualize all the options that's why vs code sucks so much to customize it does suck to customize you have to look up every single option it takes a long time I would argue making a good vs code experience that makes it to what you want my phone needs to shut up is no different than trying to learn how to do vs code it's like the same thing team on CSS so it's not it's more relearning in that aspect but that's beside the point I just don't have any interest in learning another language at the moment and I've tried you match in the past and every time I do I just come out feeling overwhelmed and disinterested I should say so bad take have you anyone curation that takes in a function check s a couple values and then does something good luck with your little vs code Json that's gonna go well that's definitely not gonna suck it's great if all you do is put in values but the moment you want to do something custom the moment you want to add one the moment you want to check for anything it becomes excessively difficult BS is what I'm calling that is the reason why it should not shows emacs Kate is the one that I've chosen for now we'll see where this journey kind of takes me and hopefully I'll get good enough of coding that I won't be so embarrassed by it and I'll be able to share some of that stuff with you guys in the future we'll see uh as is right now I think an accomplishment for me but it's still very early days even though it's been months so that's in the future uh that's it for this video I love I actually really like his mentality on some of these things the idea that uh that it does take a while to get good at anything it does take some time it does take some effort and it just like start programming and expect yourself to be good is is crazy right like I really like that mentality that he's like you know it's early days I know it's been a couple months but it's still very early days just past hello world very very true very very good take on that which is that if you're if you're in it to learn it you know it is most certainly a 10-year thing it's not a 10-month thing and I think people confuse that they go to a react boot camp they listen to a couple YouTube videos and they call themselves something fantastic 10 months ain't it 10 years is a much better way to kind of gauge yourself than 10 months yeah he's great this is great I love this if you have any thoughts on this you can leave those in the comment section below I'd love to hear from you if you uh could be so kind to leave a thumbs up on this video I'd really appreciate it really just help the channel you can follow me on Macedon obviously those links will be in the video description you can support me on patreon patreon.com linuxcast if you're interested in supporting the channel through the merchandise store we now have a store you can find that at shop.thelnixcast.org there you'll find t-shirts and mugs and hats and all that stuff it's a great way to support the channel and get something actually in return so thanks everyone who does who has done that and we'll do that in the future I really do appreciate it as well thanks to everybody who does support me on patreon YouTube you guys are all absolutely amazing without you the channel just would not be anywhere near where it is watching I'll see you next time everybody I'm losing my voice for some reason anyways again thanks for watching thank you very much Taylor foreign [Music] hey great video thumbs up hitting with that subscribe this is good though this was genuinely good I think there's a lot of good things you can take from this video that I think are really just healthy overall in life which is that a your journey is long you do not need to get to the end right away right I think that's really good I really like that B I think I just forget how hard it really is to learn vim and to config and all that and I mean just like Judo said you're definitely no novice when it comes to Linux yet your first time going through neovim config it's it's a pain in the ass and I get that and so and then third I did not know about Kate I've never tried Kate Kate could be an interesting thing for people that want graphical experiences but don't want Microsoft that's pretty cool right anyways I like that guy that was good I really like this video the name I'm not gonna leave neovim I love neovim okay I'm sticking with neovim okay but hey he left it a jet
