i thought i'd give a quick talk on butterflies and zippers plus which is basically you know a follow-up on my last lightning talk at meeting zippers plus 2019 and maybe you remember back then i told you i would be you know taking nice pictures of butterflies and i've been doing this uh since then more or less but also i had made the decision that i wanted to do more than nice pictures i wanted to contribute to the effort of conservation and so i started with monitoring conservation and yeah being involved in this field and this has been an awesome journey and it's actually too long to give a lightning talk on so i will you know limit myself a little bit to showing you some pictures and explaining you uh what this has to do with c plus now first in the monitoring tours i do monitor every species uh but there are two species which are special this is the first one um which already was here on the other side this is uh the grading or occur bin negazant filter of deutsch which is a very threatened species because this is a species which is in heath and needs open sand in the landscape which is very rare in our nowadays so this is one of the of the rare species which flies in my county and i'm more or less with the last years trying to see where they where everywhere like where do they fly you know right this is this is my job in the monitoring uh to to track them down and to see how many can i find all those butterflies and these are kind of hard to find if it's not like on uh on a heath or on on other blooming plants um and the second species i am looking for is of deutsche decline ice fog or in english the white admiral and this is the butterfly which is not in the in the heath it's a butterfly which is more in the forest and more in the uh moist parts of a forest so it's you know close to rivers and um one of the projects i'm like next year i'm going to start because during the pandemic i have not been as much on the lakes i will look in the lake districts where i usually take other pictures uh during this winter if i find this butterfly there too because that is still in an export corner of my uh county for this butterfly and yes this butterfly flush only during summer and the other species also has just a few weeks but then of course you always need to be a bit lucky to find those butterflies um like for example this is uh basically like 100 or 200 meters away where i did find a different blue link species two years ago and i haven't seen it since and there i found this couple and back then it also was a couple but this is a different species this is agus boiling and argos is kind of the the latin name also so that's i'm not sure what the the english name is uh blue linings are not like my specialty plus english names but then also and here it gets more interesting i take pictures like that i am in monitoring mode and monitoring is has changed my habits on what i take for pictures i take pictures of every single butterfly i see i count them i track that in an app called observation and um for that i kind of try to have images which uh then you know i later load up into the website and for that i cut out the butterfly itself and because the image itself is too big and uh then you have a result like this which of course you know that's not a picture you took because it's a pretty picture that's a picture because i you know was documenting the species was here and that's part of the work i do and uh this is um for like over time this work becomes valuable so if i do it every year and other people do it every year uh the the collection of the data is very important for conservation efforts um and so i began asking myself does std find find butterflies and i'm not sure yet um but i have a friend which is also concerned about uh acid defined and so we're investigating that um but for for now um i plan you know to to use c plus plus two to write something which makes my job a bit easier the the monitoring another another example here in the monitoring i get home in summer after a long day of like hiking for like six hours sometimes and i have like 50 to 80 pictures of butterflies and i don't want to edit them all by by myself manually anymore i want to have a program which does exactly this job i want some some image recognition and i have an example for that which trains something and then uses that and i want to kind of you know put that in a cute program and make that as open source and kind of you know kind of work maybe this was some of the folks at me super plus online um together to have a little bit of fun there and then have a little bit less work with pictures in somewhere um and i got the also part of this work is caterpillars and i'm not sure like if that software also would be able to handle caterpillars but uh that's another field where i have you know been very active this year because i got a macro lens and with the macro lens i suddenly am able to document them and suddenly i keep seeing them and for the monitoring a lot of species i found for moth through the caterpillars and this is i think one of the best finds in this year this is a very rare species uh which also hadn't been found in that corner for for a few years and i hope to be able to see and find this again next year and maybe to find out a bit more about uh how how big the population of that mars in that corner is um this is a very very uh easy to find not easy to find caterpillar but this is a more in the he's uh the um emperor moth or clan snake van orgo of deutsch it's very you can see them flying the butterfly the moths fly in the dawn in april sometimes already in march depends on the weather and the caterpillar it's like really really well hidden in the heath but once you know have an eye for it and you keep looking in the heat you you keep finding them there they're kind of way more often than other caterpillars in the heath um and then um in july i heard the voice of a bird on one of the areas where i'm actually monitoring butterflies and it was directly like for me clear that this could be the species european beater and that piqued my interest to to get a good picture of that bird and i would not have dreamed to get this picture because this picture is also with a rare butterfly which is hard to to find for monitoring purpose um and so to to basically kind of get it delivered by air that's that's awesome that's that's one i think one of the best pictures i took this year and um yeah i'm gonna just end with this picture and uh this is basically what i do now for butterflies i will you know have a bit of more pictures and uh probably a talk which i prepare for that to uh you know make this a project that people can help us and we can like you know build something which helps with monitoring there and um
