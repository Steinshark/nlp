welcome to talk Tech with Tiff the New York Edition where I am sitting down with industry professionals to hear about their career Journeys and current roles I created this series to hear from people who are established in the tech industry so that we can all learn what these individuals do in their day-to-day jobs and the type of opportunities out there [Applause] hi Brian how are you today great great awesome weather I yeah I know it's kind of gray rain turned out good I know started raining now it's good tomorrow too it's supposed to be really sunny I here I know yeah so so it's it's it's the weekend's uh you know coming together I agree I agree tomorrow we usually come to New York and always have a very tight pack schedule right try and fit everything in but tomorrow we decide to take the day and just walk around so I'm happy that the weather is cooperating with my schedule I know it could have been rain I know well I'm very happy to have you here today I've been doing a lot of creeping on you leading up to this so you know going through your LinkedIn and I'm very inspired you've helded a lot of interesting titles and uh even as we were just talking off camera you've you have some really interesting experiences and I'm really looking forward to diving into those but uh can you tell me about yourself uh sure um so uh engineering leader 25 years in technology uh sounds scary scary every time I say it but I graduated with a CS degree uh at 98 uh and the first eight years of my career I was a Java developer uh you know rising in seniority um from a junior to a senior to a tech lead around 05 to 2010 I was a player coach manager managing uh you know s to 12 person teams coding but also managing and 2010 is really where my my um engineering leadership career started 2010 is where I worked at kast and media uh entertainment fashion and from 2010 to 2015 I had um grown the department and uh relaunched several of the digital products for tablet mobile web and um then from 2015 um uh to 20 I was at Major League Soccer and Major League Soccer was really a special place because one it's a sports industry their product is the game of soccer and and my job was to work with product reassemble the team and launch a a a a appropriate digital product on mobile connected television web that that really made sense next to this physical game of soccer and and it was really awesome experience uh I wasn't really a soccer guy but I became one during then and and just being in a totally different industry was was definitely a learning experience 2020 uh was another inflection point and and non- coincidentally uh I had made a career change because that was when covid started yes and so there I went and started getting into my interests deeper with with blockchain crypto and I started a a career in crypto and since then I've been in the uh BL in crypto industry working for various companies but the last 6 months I've been um a a Management Consultant fractional CTO and adviser for for various uh software companies both both web 3 and web two yes both web 3 and web two uh early stage and helping them sort of um get their uh product out there that's really interesting I like how your career journey is you it's it's fun because in some of these conversations we've been really hitting on that Tech impacts every industry and your career Journey you know from from early on really is a good example of that working with K Nast media I know K Nast is not just fashion but I a huge part of it one area of it is right and then uh Major League Sports being the sports industry and then now to working with web 3 and what that entails but going back to you you said you went to you started in computer science in '98 right yeah yeah '94 that's when I got to college and then I I I I didn't actually go to college initially for computer science oh okay yeah yeah yeah so um I I'll I'll try to keep the way back machine uh commentary short but in '94 computers and the internet were not ubiquitous in 1994 um and I went in un undecided I didn't know what I wanted to do but I did know I liked problem solving and I did know that I liked um uh um really this idea of of of structured logic and so I started out actually in philosophy then I got into religion Eastern religion I was studying Eastern religion and then I got into math okay this is my first year and then at the end of my first year beginning my second year my sophomore year that's when I found computer science so I actually got into computer science not because of there were no websites a lot there were no computers people didn't really have a lot of computers but I got into it because it was a a a really interesting application of of problem solving wow when when you got into to because of of exactly what you just said you know the it wasn't like it is today as far as the internet and computers what was and this is a very silly kind of silly question but like what was the main when you were studying computer science what did you were you like after I graduate this is what I want to do with it yeah that's a actually a really great question because you know when you were when when we were those of us in the mid90s to late 90s that were in computer science what we envision doing yeah what we thought the opportunities were was really limited it was okay we'll work at Microsoft Oracle help of databases IBM help you know helpless services but it was really like um a small set of Amazon didn't really exist yeah so so it was really more like oh I guess I'm going to be a programmer and I guess I'm going to help uh you know be a part of some really large sort of platform or machine and and I'm going to own this one class or set of functions so that's what we thought and that even that was really fun but but it you know when right when I graduated in that four years from 9498 things changed and so things started opening up and and my first job was at Motorola in Austin Texas yeah and and yeah but I didn't really know what to expect cuz it was changing so fast it was yeah you were really during after graduating that was really around the the internet boom like that bubble early 2000s were changing so quickly and that's interesting because I'm sure even uh subconsciously the skills and being comfortable with things changing so quickly has maybe helped you with the environment of web 3 that's continuing to evolve and grow kind of like seeing it all over again would you say or well I think I'm lucky because my my my my vantage point has been such that I saw the be the start of web one let's call Web one static websites yeah web one go to web two yeah let's call it rich interaction um and web two to web three yeah and so I I think what I'm lucky uh you know in my career for is that I I've gained this an adaptability yes 100% And so I'm I'm used to sort of building on a swamp and knowing that oh this might change or might go away and so we have to keep thinking what could be next exactly and you're also used to to seeing when these you know from web one web 2 the this period of time where it's not fully adopt adapted yet to say everyone um the general public and what not and but seeing how it's just I'm sure you can kind of see ahead or look ahead to where it will be no yeah yeah that's very interesting um I want to talk more about what you're currently doing but before we get there a lot of listeners on on here are either software Engineers or in that technical space um or want to want to get into it and one question that I think comes up through just in conversation is when we think of you know we're going down this path of okay I graduate from computer science I became a software engineer then I will become a manager and then continue up to VP which which title you've held uh for many roles what is what would you say for someone who wants to go down that path to expect in the sense of when you're holding uh a higher rep title do you still code as much what does that look like compared to when you were yeah okay so that's okay good question um so let me first start up by saying that you know the manager track in an engineer's career isn't always necessary for Progress that's the first this is a common theme with with a lot of the engineers in my teams uh to equate career progress with attaining some form of authority progress can occur as an individual con contributor in terms of the scope of your work the complexity the application the the the part of the stack you're on so the first thing I always sort of talk to Engineers about is is this something you you truly want to do and then we'll talk about like what is what is this what is management right so let's define that first and just think about it be a little conscious because what I do know is that some folks say well you know the thing I do know is I want to move up in my career and so that means I must be a manager and so first I like to take a pause on that and and and kind of reflect ref and and and just revisit that that sort of presumption okay but for those that do want to go in the management I'll also say this try it before you buy it ah so what does that mean well you know there's lots of opportunities that that are around you and that your that your boss should should should match you up with where you can test drive so examples could be a tech lead team lead or even for a small project be uh you know I'll I'll coordinate I'll own that I'll I'll I'll set it up in my project management platform or tool and make the tickets and yes so try that first because you you it'll give you a feel for for what your path is now let's get back to your question so for those that have tried it they like it I'm pretty sure this is what I want to do what can I expect well the answer there is it depends it depends on the size of your company MH it depends on how uh engineering management is defined so in some companies Engineering Management is defined as leaning heavily on Resource Management people skills in some places Engineering Management is like 50/50 sliding scale so that's another um important yeah thing and and that's something to understand your company or a company that you're looking into and ask that question yeah now um what I've seen more or less uh let's say across companies that are below 100 maybe 100 to um 200 yeah Engineering Management is a combination of Highly technical Hands-On but probably like less than 50 maxing at 50% so you are still coding but you're not coding a lot why well because your prior your primary goal is to achieve success for the team and so if you're going to prioritize things well you want to make sure your team succeeds before you finish writing your function exactly and then consequently your project shouldn't put you in a critical path where you need to make this thing as a manager completed checked in and and deployed you know at this time so so yes there is uh development um but often times it's um it's it's it's it's uh at a lower priority at a lower percentage that makes sense because at the end of the day like you mentioned one of your main goals is to help your team or maybe your main goal depending on your company uh is to help your team succeed and if your full focus is developing new features you can't also be managing a team on top of that true but the the other uh things to consider is I said that it depends on um the company size that so that's an important thing um the other thing to think about is it depends on the industry you're in and then it depends on um the level of management you are at yeah so management just like engineering has let's say levels yes and as you manage larger and larger teams mhm and your management seniority increases also your likelihood of coding might decrease therefore if you need to stay you know cognizant of techn technological Trends it is kind of on you as a manager to actually code outside of work yeah that's a very good point that was one of the questions I had for you actually was around how how do you do that got to do it at and that's when you now it's getting into like life work life balance how much what do you do with your free time are you cool with coding on your free and so you know that's what it ends up being so that's the thing that goes back to the discussion I have with with um Engineers who are considering this path yes because if you like coding all the time well then you know management might work because you can still code at night but if you really want to just be coding between 9 to six yeah and you want to keep doing that well then rethink you know like what what what you're getting into but you can always try and I always think you should because you don't know if you want to or if you can until you try just take a test drive yeah yeah when you when you are coding outside of when you were when I know you're more Consulting right now but for for the coding portion of it yeah would you recommend and maybe it varies person to person but for for your own experience do you do would you do freelancing on the side or would it be more so personal interest projects good question I it's it's really whatever is at uh you know whatever opportunities are at at your disposal so here's an example A lot of times and this is the Mind usually of an engineer you'll have a repetitive task and you'll think wow you know what like I just want to do something about that and so that's a great opportunity to sort of learn something so for me I picked up python yeah because I have a massive MP3 collection and it's like completely untagged and the album art is not there so I wrote a python script I learned python by reading you know my Apple um music database and making calls to different services to find the album art for a given album and then boom and so if you have those kinds of um personal needs I definitely think it's the best place because then you know if if you don't get it done then it's on you exactly but if you're making a website for your aunt and you know yeah it's so true it's I think those are for me as well that's that's the best is when I'm building something for myself that I actually can see a need for that will help me in the end because then you're you're double motivated you know you're learning new skills continuing to keep your your coding up to date if you're not doing it for 9 to for example but then also to you're actually solving a problem whereas sometimes if I say I'm creating a project and it's more so to learn something new but the project I'm creating doesn't actually solve a real world problem of my own or say someone else is that is when I often fall off that project and it just kind of collects dust the the the key the key to really good work yeah is finding an internal motivation to do that work and so whatever that it is you know motivating you there has there should be something because then you'll produce your best work exactly I love that and then for your role now Consulting for both web 2 and web 3 companies what does what does that entail moving from the you know from the the VP of engineering to to Consulting side yeah it's it's it's really interesting because you know on one hand I've got a larger Department running meetings doing one-on ones um uh working with stakeholders and now I'm in a world it's it's really the purity of producing a product or a service and getting it across the finish line and taking a 360 view to sort of point out gaps that might be in the way or how do we how do we get this thing started so really to take a step back what do I do so I've got a handful of clients that um need to take an idea to a proof of concept okay take a proof of concept to an MVP or have an MVP out there and try to refine their current operations because it might be really costly in AWS or or they have a they have a they have a engineering team in in offshore and they're unsure if if they're you know um operating effectively and so you know I I'll kind of come in at different life stages for an early stage startup yes and help them so what that really means is either bootstrapping an effort I work with Founders like a CEO I got this idea I want to try into this and then I'll often times match them up with um a agency that can do that kind of work oh I see and then cuz I've got uh relationships with different agencies and then we'll um craft together like a a project that can produce a proof of concept and then with a proof of concept then that's how you get funding The Next Step so that's so I'll do a lot of that um uh for some companies they're kind of in motion and they already have something out there and I might come in there and sort of um be an observer and and do what we call Gap analysis Gap analysis so what does that mean so that could mean like maybe you have a agile process okay but I might sit in and be like w you know well if you did tweak your stand-ups to do this or if you added a retro or did a demo well then stakeholders might get to see what you're making sooner versus later and give you feedback blah BL so a lot of times it's just tweaking things and um producing more more um effective results just from small tweaks so so I I do a lot of that especially with startups that are you know even proof of concept or in any stage that you just mentioned they're moving and learning so quickly so to have someone like yourself come in and be able to make those small tweaks it has such a huge impact yeah yeah yeah and do you like that are you enjoying this role more than say some of your previous ones where it's more you know I think this is sort of a life answer here I enjoy everything yeah that I do what I'm doing at any point and I try to find um something you know important and valuable yeah in the things I do and I try to do that you know and even just Bal moments sometimes I just try to take a break wow you know like this table is really cool and I really appreciate the structure and the craftsmanship so with work I think it's just it's it's a lot of interesting things that are all different um I I can say though that it it really feels uh extremely fulfilling to have such a massive impact on a small company trying to produce something and so there's definitely a a different kind of experience with what I'm doing now are you are you and this is maybe be asking to be like pick your favorite child but do you prefer right now working with web two or web 3 companies not necessarily the companies but the Technologies oh that is a great question well I'm just going to say that you know I I am a I I'm always chasing Innovation yeah so web yeah it's always and right now let's let's let's kind of just say what what is web 3 well let's if you say web 3 is this concept of digital ownership provable verifiable digital ownership yes that is achieved through decentralization yeah well then you you're really talking about a next level of computing yeah similar to when colge Computing got introduced it's it's very so so in that there's this primordial ooze phase of of blockchain that is just so cool because like you're looking at I'm looking at things and and working on projects that are already um morphing yeah and and and and in months oh my good because it's changing so fast so quickly yeah and then how do you as someone who's working with these companies how do you keep up with it as it's changing so quickly you know I I this is this is really I think a a general question for most technologists like how do you keep in touch with technical Trends cuz there's so much out there well you have to be really efficient and effective with how you consume information yeah like podcasts so what I do try to um do is that I try to fill in moments yeah like driving a car or running with learning unities yeah and so what that means is it ends up being lots of podcasts lots of medium I I subscrib to medium I download articles yeah I use moments where I'm sitting on a um on a subway and I'll just like read uh you know a new article on gp4 you can can you download medium articles sure if you if you pay for it you can download and now you can organize them in the lists that's and say oh I want to download all the lists on you know on on on on chat GPT and how to use it best that's super useful that's a really good thing to do and then um and um uh another thing I'll do is really pick my favorite email um content aggregators um Hacker News has one lots of people have tldr is a great one give a shout out to tldr it's a really good way to get information and especially in web 3 and blockchain I mean things change by the day and so that's how I I'll usually get a lot of my information at the end of the day it's it's more so it seems like and this is what I I guess with with not only web tree but Tech in general it's more so about being open to continue to learn and you know evolve with tech ver and through doing that by listening or reading through different platforms then trying to be one step ahead of it at all times because it's kind of impossible you say yeah you kind of have to just be flexible and assume things will change and and just um you you know not get too um comfortable yeah yes you know that that's really what it is I I I had an engineer um you know at Major League Soccer and he did something that I thought was so interesting and I really learned from it he he had an IDE you know how what you code in and everyone has an ID they Cod and there this is my ID I love it but he would change it every year no and everyone was using this one ID and he changed it I was trying to enforce a specific IDE also really sort of a minor point of contention at first but he he was like no I I I already know how this works I I want to change it and just just just kind of break up how I work because it rewires how I think about things 100 and so that's a really great example of how like you can make little minute changes and it it it's a little bit of a um sort of like a a microshock to to your brain to keep malleable exactly wow I I'm going to actually steal that and try that because I have for well I started with Symphony with um uh so PHP what was it storm PHP storm yeah that was was my first job was with that but then since then it's always been with vs code for my ID a lot of people it is a great ID and and people have landed there and it's funny because prior to vs code you had all these different ones and I I I would say it's kind of like oh man like what what could you do outside of vs code but it's it's worth a check to see what's out there try something new and and it it's just a good way to sort of keep fresh yeah yeah there's so many ways you could do that but that's such a great example of changing something in your environment that doesn't take a lot of effort to change but it but to but it does take some time and to get familiar with it and it's learning again like rewiring your at the end of the day you want to make sure that you're always learning at every moment and so what are little things you can do to do that I I'll I always tell people this uh because I I also do martial arts one thing I learned in martial arts is switch the hand your dominant hand so if you open your hand with your right the open the S Open Your Door the the door with your right hand try with your left hand try with your left if you comb with your right just come with your left hand so things like that you know like it's they're little little microshock to sort of get you to sort of absorb things differently and I love that example because martial arts completely different than Tech or you know career I mean some people's career of course but at the end of the day I think that's one of the things that um I really like about tech is that the skill a lot of the skills that you buil uh can be translated in so many other areas like you like you just said yeah it's true Brian if you were you know to to look back at your younger self starting from you know your days at K Nest MLS like what what is some advice that you would give your younger self um well actually we just touched on it uh just earlier don't be comfortable you know that's that's a mantra I probably have been practicing since my my maybe my mid-30s like just don't be comfortable um and and what ises what do I mean by that well you know your growth usually happens uh outside of your comfort zone yeah always or usually and so yeah I didn't really start thinking like that till my mid-30s oh that would have been great if I started thinking like that in my teens you know you're a teenager or even in your 20s like I know I got this I know what's up I know I that's that's the only band that matters um but yeah just don't be comfortable and then you know I think every old older version of oneself wants to tell the younger one to save and invest more 100% save and invest more get uncomfortable and continue to grow yeah I love that Brian thank you so much for sitting down and chatting with me today um I'll link down your information below and uh I just I really loved hearing your story it's really inspiring to me so thank you for your time no problem thanks for having me thank you [Music]
