if you think about approach and avoidance I I sort of make a distinction IM morality between two kinds of morality one is prescriptive and one is proscriptive prescriptive is based in avoidance these are the things we shouldn't do you shouldn't lie you shouldn't steal you shouldn't cheat right we all know that right but proscriptive morality is about not doing the wrong thing it's it's based in inhibition constraint and so forth if you look at liberals and conservatives they don't differ in terms of how much they think you should be helping or or they may say you should help different people but where you start seeing huge differences is the group based [Music] morality hello everyone I'm talking today with Dr Ronnie janof Bulman she's a professor amerita at the University of Massachusetts Amherst she's a social psychologist and the author of two books one from about 30 years ago called shattered assumptions and the other called the two moralities the origin and fall of right and left politics why did I want to talk to Dr janof Bulman well I'm very interested in both angles of her work first because the notion of shattered assumptions is associated with the idea that there's something like a hierarchy of values in our beliefs in in the structure of our beliefs that we have some beliefs that are more fundamental than others those would be beliefs that many other beliefs depend upon and so I wanted to talk to her about what it might mean that the assumptions that Orient Us in the world are organized hierarchically right so that some things are deep and other things peripheral and so that the deep things are in some sense the most real and vital all of those topics we're going to talk about in the discussion with Dr Ronnie janof pman so I'm interested in two your two major works I I want to talk to you about shattered assumptions and I want to talk to you about the political divide and I think we'll start with shattered assumptions and so um why don't you start by letting everybody who's watching and listening know know what you were what you meant when you discussed shattered assumptions and why you felt that was a reasonable way of approaching the problem of uh traumatic traumatic injury post-traumatic stress disorder right profound disillusionment even okay I mean that's work that's now 30 years old I should say that um but um I'm a social psychologist not a clinical psychologist um and I did a great deal of research on um victimization back 30 and 40 years ago and what I was finding um was some commonality actually a great deal of commonality across victimizations things that we would Now call trauma rape victims loss of loved ones early um accident victims natural disaster victims um and um at the time the clinical literature really was somewhat problematic from my perspective because it was looking at people as pathological as opposed to the situations as pathological in some sense um and um I kept hearing the same thing from people uh across these domains which was um I never thought it could happen to me which was kind of surprising at the time because you know we assume people know bad things happen right um but um it led me actually to do uh some work in uh and further research and um I posited this notion of shattered assumptions based on a um sort of people's ackn finding that what we now know as implicit cognition at the time there was no little no work really or very little work on implicit cognition but finding that basically people's beliefs about these fundamental beliefs about the world seem to have gotten shattered that beliefs about the world being meaningless meaningful not random benevolent people being worthy all of a sudden people really question these very very basic beliefs that they didn't even necessarily know they had um and it led me to this notion of shattered assumptions uh which now if I wrote the book now would um be a little easier to to uh claim because of all we now know about implicit cognition right these were implicit beliefs um and um the they these police actually were not necessarily Illusions I mean they were these sort of working models of the world um a good enough world and um after these negative events they they did seem seem to get shattered people had a sense of their own fragility their creatureliness you know we have we're we're humans and species with symbolic systems and yet we're we're food for worms you know that notion of fragility Terror so forth and so on so so basically I I was writing it in some ways as a corrective to much that was out there in these very distinct domains so there would be a literature on rape victims for example or literature on natural disasters now I should say there were wonderful people working at the time clinicians who certainly um you know knew certainly as much as I did and probably lots more um but they had a very different perspective social psychology I think is a very healthy way of viewing the world because it normalizes as opposed to pathologizes and that's where I was coming from I don't know if that's sufficiently responds to question yeah oh yeah yeah well it's it's it's definitely a good start okay so now you mentioned something that I'll just get you to clarify a bit you said that if you were writing this book today with what we know about implicit cognition that your argument would be easier to justify so just like flesh that out a bit before I ask you some other question questions well well the notion well the fact is that now we have implicit beliefs that people don't necessarily know they have it's so it's easy to argue that when something happens and the inner world gets shattered that these very fundamental beliefs now which which really are at the base of our conceptual World um can be impacted by real life events even though we don't know we hold them you see at the time yeah yeah see at the time it that wasn't necessarily clear people would say well we know what we believe everybody knows what you know you see um that's all I meant by that Jordan yes okay okay okay good well that that's I presume that's what you meant okay so now let me run an idea by you and you you tell me what you think about this and see if it's in accordance with what you believe so I've been trying to think about this um in part neurologically because I'm interested in why anxiety and Terror might be radically dis anxiety and Terror and Pain radically disinhibited by the shattering of belief and hope destroyed at a fundamental level okay so now you believe in something approximating a fundamental level so so let me let let me explain what I think that might mean and then you tell me what you think about that okay so in the landscape of implicit cognition there are hierarchical dependencies there there are some presumptions that we make they might be implicit upon which many other presumptions uh rest that's like that's a good definition of fundamental here's a here's a way of thinking about it um imagine that you track the citation count of a scientist's work well the more if the discipline hasn't become corrupt the more citations broadly speaking that a given scientist has the more their work is fundamental to the field and the reason for that is because much other work in that field depends on those Publications otherwise they they wouldn't be massively cited and so then you could imagine that in a system of belief there are levels of dependency those levels of dependency have a bedroom Rock and at that Bedrock everything rests that seem reasonable to you absolutely absolutely okay good so let's okay so let me go a little farther with this and you tell me if you object to any of this okay so I've come to understand that that implicit structure through which we see the world is equivalent to um a waiting system it looks to me like it's equivalent to the statistical weights that large language models extract yeah that makes sense to you too okay okay so then we have to filter the world through a system of Weights that's how we prioritize our attention we have to prioritize our attention because there's too much information there's way too much information there's way too many possibilities so we prioritize and we do so in keeping with our axiomatic assumptions and they have a hierarchical structure structure of dependency now if something happens to us that violates those assumptions then it blows The Waiting system it demolishes the waiting system that we use to prioritize our attention and everything comes flooding back okay do you know Carl friston's work by any chance uh not well so okay okay well this is an exciting thing so Carl friston has a model of perception that's very welldeveloped and he's a very well-sited neuroscientist he invented most of the what would you call it the procedures that people use to investigate MRI images for example right okay so FR friston's a very wellestablished neuroscientist and he believes that both anxiety and positive emotion are related to entropy control so this is different than Terror management it's a way diff it's a very different idea although they're analogous in some sense okay so anxiety signals the collapse of a system of orientation so that hierarchical waiting is no longer possible so that way too many things impinge upon you at once and anxiety is actually the signal that that happens technically it's the signal that that's happening and so it's the flooding back of chaos right and that enough okay now the consequence of this we know the psychophysiological consequences of this the psychophysiological consequences are accelerated an acceleration of the stress response right exactly hyper preparation on the psychophysiological side right and that is sufficiently stressful to be physiologically and neurologically damaging right the hyper hypervigilance that comes with uh trauma is clearly uh consistent with that the thing I would is the thing I say that's interesting is one doesn't even need to P I mean obviously there is a waiting system and you know the accuracy at the top very top levels is absolutely essential and at the fundamental levels at some level you can have some elusory beliefs because I mean if it's very dangerous I believe I can swim and I'm a great swimmer but I go into a pool and I can't swim I'm in trouble if I think the world is is sort of more benevolent than it really is that's not going to get me you know that's that's really a fundamental belief that's not going to get me into as much trouble but can guide me in a positive way okay one of one of the things I was going to say is I'm not sure you need to even posit The Waiting system in the case of trauma because I think what although I don't think we would disagree about this what is being shattered and disrupted is the base of the of the fundamental of the system the conceptual Bedrock of the system that that shattered and the anxiety is really a double duty anxiety first of all understand living in a world that does seem more dangerous all of a sudden when you've been sort of horrible things have happened to you right there's this real world phenomenon and on top of that you have lost the guideposts to survive it right the conceptual system that orients you as you would say fistance work would talk about so you've kind of so you now have this double this anxiety that's quite remarkable that leads to a really a sense of Terror it's not well well there's there's two things that happen in friston's conceptualization and I wrote a paper about this with some students of mine too when we were trying to tie anxiety to entropy it's not only that anxiety mounts that's bad that's terrible right and it it does result in this state of psychophysiological hyper preparation which is physiologically devastating across time right it can cause brain damage it can it can make you it does in fact make you old because you're burning up excess resources the other thing that happens though is that it destroys hope and that's also an entropy problem so priston characterized positive emotion as a signal that entropy in relationship to a valued goal had decreased so so imagine that you you you posit something of value and then you move towards it and you see yourself moving towards it and that's happening validly then the the dimunition of the distance between you and the goal is signaled by dopamine release and it shows that it shows that the probability that you're going to attain that goal is increasing and that's what hope is now if you blow out your value structure if it's blow T pulled out from underneath you because your assumptions are shattered then your conceptualization of or even your belief in the possibility of a valid goal also vanishes so not only are you subsumed by anxiety you're overwhelmed by hopelessness yes no there's no question I mean and I I talk about that actually in the book but I don't talk I I only have a few pages on the neurophysiology of of um trauma because you you have to remember it was published 30 years ago so research was 35 40 years we have learned or trauma researchers and I haven't by the way done research on trauma for many years but trauma researchers have learned a great deal as you're pointing out about some of the physiological neuros pychological bases of or or ramifications of and consequences of of of trauma um which is not something that um you know that long ago we knew much about it is interesting though that from social psychology we do think about emotions as signals I mean you don't you don't even have to posit the the physi physiology or Neuroscience you can say you know the your emotions are sort of the experiential automatic signals about how you're operating in the world yeah they're navigation guides yeah yeah navigation gues so which very similar but we're talking about at different levels of analysis there yes yeah okay so now let let's let's go to the idea of of the shattering so um there's something else I want to weave in so imagine that you have an aim and that it's predicated on on a set of values now imagine that those values have a hierarchical structure in the way that we just described so there's something at the bottom now that the question is how would you characterize that structure so I have a hypothesis for you and you can tell me what you think about this I it's a hypothesis that I've developed fairly extensively but I'm working on in detail in in the new book that I'm working on right now called we who wrestle with gold so I think that the that a description of the structure through which we look at the world the hierarchy of values through which we look at the world I think that's literally what a story is see a story so okay so so a story look if you go to a movie and you watch the protagonist hero or villain here's what you'll see you'll see a a sequence of situations in which the aim of the character is Port becomes clear right now when you watch that what happens is that you infer his aim and you adopt that you embody that this is literally how you understand it you embody it you come to see the world through that perspective and you experience the emotions that are part and parcel of that aim right so that's a form of exploration right because it means you can go to a movie or you can watch piece of fiction you can adopt a temporary aim it's like a game you can adopt a temporary aim and in consequence you can explore the consequences of that aim but also have the experience that goes along with it it's the same thing that people are doing by the way when they go to a sports stadium and they and they watch someone aiming at the goal right and being skillful in their approach right they adopt the aim which is the goal that's why they identify with the team and then they embody the emotions that are appropriate to that aim okay so so I think this is I think this is a fundamental say I figured this out in part 30 years ago when I was looking at the neuros pychology of expectation right there's a big cognitive psychology litery on expectation is all all about it right right right but but there's something there's something about that that's wrong because we don't expect in the world we desire we desire right our expectations are specified by our desires and that's a useful twist because it brings in it integrates motivation see if it's cold cognitive expectation we're prediction machines but we're not we're motivated machines we're pursuing our desires and so right our aims are motivated right right and so we're upset when the outcome doesn't match our desire not when the outcome doesn't match our expectation that's very interesting I um I guess I agree in part I do think that I mean there's such a huge literature and psychology on expectation that doesn't necess let's let's assume you're responding to somebody on the basis of a stereotype for example you're responding based on expectation you generally operate to confirm it but I'm not sure that's based on a desire so I'm not sure all of it is motivated I think some of it is some much is motivated I agree with you but I think much is there is a great deal that's not motivated cogn cognition the the bulk of our human functioning is but okay well so I think I think we can solve that conundrum given the framework we're already using so imagine that we're seeing the world through a a hierarchy of value right with something okay the farther down the Assumption hierarchy you go towards the base the more motivation is in involved if you're just playing on the periphery where things don't matter then it's expectation but if you go down Into the Depths then it starts to become highly motivated and that's that's BEC part of that motivation is the fact that as you go down into the depths the world like your stability depends on the what on what you desire making itself manifest or at least not being radically violated right right that's right your stability depends on your working models actually working right um and and I do agree uh you know you know it's interesting we talk about motivation because when I was doing the two moralities book of course all of that is funneled right through motivation I mean the the two fun the fundamental Notions of approach and avoidance I mean that is really how we organize our lives right I believe in motivation believe for sure okay okay okay so so are you or someone you know fighting the battle against cancer for the last 25 years invita medical centers have been pioneering personalized cuttingedge

and the neurophysiological literature of the early 60s and and it came out of cybernetic modeling and it came out of neuros pychological modeling and early cognitive science and the notion there again as I said was that people were rather cold prediction machines expectation machines that's where the notion of something like working model came from but I believe that there's there's a serious flaw that the fact that that doesn't incorporate motivation the fact that it's expectation rather than desire is it it does two things it's a fundamental flaw because it takes motivation out of the picture and that's a big problem because like we're highly motivated and the second thing it does is it obscures the fact that what we're not modeling we're telling a story those aren't the same thing and this is okay okay now was going to say I agree in part I just wouldn't um paint the entire picture with that way I do think there there much there is much where we are not you know some so many things are operating without our awareness okay and I'm not I'm not talking about fraudi and you know unconscious we have automatic you know mind time you know system one system two kinds of operations so much of that um it won't necessarily it it is automatic now you can still say that automaticity der from a system that's fundamentally motivated okay but I do think I do think in its operation there's a kind of automaticity to so much that we do that so much you know that that at least um you know I don't have any problem saying it's consistent with a motivational model but I feel like that that in fact as it operates it does it does look like fure cognition in many cases and that we're just we're confirming expectations because that um because that's how we can operate in the world you know and that's that is motivation okay so let me take that a little part a bit because I'm going to reformulate it and I'll tell you why and I'll tell you why I think that's in keeping with your theory so confirming in expectation um no testing our fundamental narrative hypothesis and why because we want to make sure that the foundation is remaining intact is that automatic it's automatic until the assumptions are shattered and then automaticity dis well EXA so that's the thing so that's the that's the key that shows you that even the automaticity is dependent on the Integrity of the model that's motivated right so AOA within the Assumption it's automatic within the maintained assumption but the story is invalidated when the is okay so so let me tell you let me tell you a story and you tell me what you think about this because I think this is a story it's a fundamental story and it's gerine to your hypothesis I want to put forward the hypothesis that the framework of meaning that's shattered in the case of trauma is a it's a naive framework now it might be licit it's a naive form of faith and we know that naivity is a risk factor for trauma because we know that people who are dependent are more likely to be traumatized so okay so so here's here's the naivity element of it I I want to tell you I want to bring in a fundamental story since I think these assumption networks are stories okay so I've been studying the story of Joe and story of job is the story of suffering yes and meaningless right what seems like random events right well or worse than random malevolent malevolent right so so worse than random okay so this is how the story sets itself up so we're told at the beginning of the story that job is a good man and so and we have the testimony of God himself on on job's account and so God is up in heaven um bragging away so to speak about how good job is and his sons come to observe and one of whom is Satan and Satan says I don't think job's that good I think he's just fortunate and God says no I think he's good and Satan says why don't you let me have a crack at him and we'll see if he's good and so God says yeah okay have do your worst and in consequence and that's the malevolent element let's say at least the arbitrary element but perhaps the malevolent element job loses everything that he's worked for virtually everything he works for he loses much of his family he's uh he's he becomes very ill and not just ill but in ill in a way that's disfiguring and shameful and then his friends come along his friends and tell him that well you know if he had been a better guy none of this would have happened so really it's his fault and then job job has a response and this is why I'm bringing up this story job's response is to insist that despite proximal evidence it's a requirement to maintain faith in the essential goodness of the individual especially an individual who's been conducting himself ethically which job has been by his own testimony by God's testimony we know job is a good man and job job's wife tells him when she observes his suffering she says there's nothing left for you to do but shake your fist at God curse him and die and job says instead and he insists this to his friends he refuses to lose faith in his essential goodness and he also refuses to lose faith in the essential goodness of God and there's something it's something like this this is what's relevant to the shattered assumptions notion is that in order to stabilize the structure through which you view the world it is necessary to adopt as axiomatic the notion that whatever happens to you if you conduct yourself ethically is the best thing that could happen regardless of the proximal evidence and also it's necessary for you not to lose faith in the essential goodness of being itself and those are those are religious proclamations right they're proclamations of a kind of religious Faith right right well and and it seems to me too and tall and tall orders at that right oh God the the yes the tallest in fact the tallest exactly well it's interesting a because the Book of Job is one of the books that really sets the stage in the biblical Corpus for the story of the crucifixion right because the crucifixion story is the story of Job expanded even more thoroughly right now these shattered assumptions that you describe they they seem to me to be identical to axioms of Faith conceptually speaking right they're a prior commitments except yes at some level except you know they developed you know the the way we think we should need to think about them is he developed from early infancy from childhood I these are they're based in you know it's not like somebody's taking a leap of faith faith is based on you know you don't need sort of um there validity in the world is irrelevant do you know that's what faith is about right um You Don't things don't have to there's no proof right um it's it's it's it's it you take it a leap an Act of Faith these are fundamental beliefs based on experience they're not they're not just you know sort of in the sky they're not things that you know I I I want to believe that these are not desires they're based on let's say the infant who is getting good enough parenting not great parent good enough parenting realizes the world is predictable the child cries the mother the father come and help the world becomes meaningful becomes benevolent you know it's good world I'm getting fed I must be worth something I mean these are very you know rudimentary kind of beliefs but it starts there and and it builds and you know what comes first obvious viously gets confirmed um I do think though you were calling them naive at one level it's what allows us to wake up in the morning and approach the day okay yeah assuming our assumptions haven't been shattered they haven't been shattered that's right but even if they have been shattered the the the the what we what um is also important to recognize is people that started with these positive assumptions actually do better in coping with the shattered beliefs because they actually have something to kind of move back to okay if you start with very negative beliefs about the world if you start with you know you are going to be more prone to possibly the a realistic view of the world being bad if that's what you know uh when bad things do happen in the world right to good people right bad things happen to good people um then nevertheless you are going to be more prone to depression and anxiety just you know living in the world is harder so some of these are what seem seem like auser beliefs are you know are what allow us to be you talked about motivation it allows us to get be motivated on a daily basis to function and operate and you know love and care and you know so I do think and and they have long-term um consequences when bad things happen because what happens if after the shattering is people try to rebuild these assumptions in the best cases and by the way most cases not the cases that all go to psychologist and whatever if you if you did huge Community surveys which we did you find lots of people have gone through some really horrible things and don't necessarily go to a clinician you know now everybody goes to clinicians 30 40 years ago that wasn't the case um people people coped they did well know they had people who cared around them they their own um sort of internal worlds allow them to to TI of deal one thing that I found that was fascinating for example is said self-blame was remarkably common after all of these things even when I I I was I I I did some work with um people who are paraplegics or quadriplegics from being shot randomly on the street or um just um you Rand truly random events you and I would unquestionably call random when as a for for the victim and um this would still engage in some self-blame now why it's it's not and by the way the only literature that talked about self lame were rape victims because everybody was blaming the women anyway right which was just because victims blame themselves doesn't mean they're blameworthy okay so why why blame why engage in this in in you know in ways that seem inappropriate given the true situation it's because that allowed people to get some sense of control to start believing the world isn't random to start believing the world is not as bad as they thought taking some of the blame on themselves now the sad part of that is of course other people could then blame them more if they were blaming themselves when that is not appropriate or legitimate but what we do in terms of our own coping I think is really kind of fascinating and that was something that was surprising to me seeing all this self-blame but there are lots of other ways people cop you know um they think of worse cases um but people would you know sort of try to rebuild assumptions of course initially there's a lot of numbing and people can't kind of deal with the situation but over time you get all the intrusive thoughts right not the denial but the intrusive thoughts when you're ready to work on it and our brains our our our our human species systems are remarkable at working on things that need to be solved even when we're not consciously doing it right and over time what I found is people did remarkably well that doesn't mean they they never returned to the same as you would say naive assumptions but they turned to more positive assumptions about the world and were sadder but wiser and now felt that they could could basically incorporate the negative events in a broader sort of belief system that was still fundamentally positive right okay okay so let's Okay so let's take a bunch of that apart the first issue I'd like to address there is probably the notion of Illusion so I spent a lot of time looking at Shelly Taylor's work the necessity of positive illusion yeah well I I am I am not a fan of the idea of positive Illusions in the least I think it's I think it's one of the most dangerous philosophical ideas ever put forward by academics that okay and I I know it's aligned with Terror management Theory too that we need to that we need to inhabit a world of some like necessary Fiction it's predicated on the idea that reality itself is so unbearable that if we ever saw it in its unvarnished form it would demolish us no I'm not I'm not there either okay okay so so so a better model perhaps go back yeah go ahead go ahead no I was going to say one thing is you were talking about the hierarchy of belief earlier go back to that elusory beliefs at the very fundamental level which allow you to have some positive motivation getting up in the morning dealing with life and so those actually could be very good they're very strong positive motivation to move ahead to go to to act in the world you don't want illusions at the higher levels right you can't if you do you're G to you actually will not be able to deal with the real real world as I was bringing up before if I have an illusion about what a good swimmer I am and I jump into a pool and I can't swim that's pretty damn unfortunate right so I do think you know shelle and others didn't make this distinction about using hierarchy but go back to the to the what you were talking about earlier if you incorporate it into a hierarchical system illusions at the bottom could be wonderfully and positively motivating As you move up they're very very dangerous right okay so so let's let's focus on that because I don't think that the re proper replacement for a naive optimism is a functional illusion because I don't think that the the retooling produces an illusion so let me explain why if you are dealing with people with an anxiety disorder you can have them organize a hierarchy of fear things they'll avoid right and then you can take you can get them to rank order the severity of that fear and then you can get them to start working on let's say the least severe fear and you can start to expose them to that right you can have them imagine them being in that situation or start acting it out now that exposure is predicated on the idea that if they face what plagues them they'll Prevail and that's a faith in learning itself because we learn on the edge everything we learn is on the edge everything we learn is in consequence of some minor confrontation with something we don't understand some minor retooling of our assumptions and some growth okay right go go back to assimilation accommodation right exact exactly you do that you do that in a certain with a certain degree of tre trepidation and excitement right you learn when you need to accommodate and assim right right right okay so here's a fundamental assumption that's not auser if if you face the world forthrightly and voluntarily with faith in your ability to Prevail the pathway forward will make itself known to you in the best manner possible it's the Axiom of learning itself it's what we facilitate in our children and you can make an assumption that it's it's not unreasonable to make the assumption that the cosmos itself is established on that principle and I mean that in that deep sense so the terror management theorist characters right deriving their theories from Ernest Becker I love Ernest Becker's book but he's also deeply wrong the hero myth that Becker lays out is not an illusion it's actually the fundamental principle by which adaptation takes place because con confronting so confronting a sequence of minor no confronting a sequence of minor traumas let's say is exactly what fortifies you right it's the principle of medicine itself a little bit of the poison is what strengthens you and it's also but it's also the nature of learning and so to have faith in that capacity above all is not elus Y in fact it's faith in the fundamental mechanism by which people formulate their adaptation and that's see Becker Becker there was a whole literature that Becker didn't know of a that he didn't pay any attention to and so he went he went astray in his fundamental presumptions and so did the terror management theorists in con You' got to say you've got to believe also that not everything works on faith I mean there if if you know the fact that you can't swim I'm going to go back to this example again and you jump in the water order because you think you can do it you you know faith is not going to is not going to allow you to survive okay stupid yeah well that's stupidity but that's what you're saying but but it sounds like stupidity but that's what you're saying I mean the fact is we I I think you know it's all a matter of opinion but I think we learn by being exposed to situations that are new that we are able to assimilate if it is too different different you know assimilate or we you know we're can ass imated because it works or we can accommodate our structures to basically incorporate it if there is too much of a disconnect it doesn't it can't happen and right because we don't we don't know how to manage trauma that's right in trauma in trauma the disconnect is at the Bedrock level whereas in much daily life the disconnect you know I don't want to talk about small traumas it's sort of interesting Jordan that um the word trauma gets so overused now right you know I get a call from a podcaster in England that wants me to give to talk about the all the people being traumatized by the Queen's death this is an old woman that you could expect would die you know that's really I don't call that trauma right right and you probably wouldn't either we we now live in a world where the word has gotten so overused that I feel it's it it it demeans it in a way that people who really are traumatized and go through your trauma um you know sort of aren't being recognized so what they have of course it's careless it's very careless okay so let's go back to the

to put a neurological spin on that in relationship to what we're discussing okay so okay so you said and rightly so you said that we can bite off more than we can chew and we can neither assimilate nor accommodate we can't we can't digest and we can't adjust ourselves because the the mouthful was too big right we've taken on okay Cheng is too great okay so so here's something you tell me what you think about this because I think this is like the coolest idea ever so we're attracted towards optimal challenge by the sense of meaning it grips us okay so instinct is the no meaning is the Instinct that puts us on the edge of optimal change okay if we talk about meaning as assimilation yes yes okay well well I would say meaning meaning is the motivation that puts us on that edge okay right and it's something like okay so now it grips our attention mhh right it activates positive emotion MH MH right and it it it does something like optimize anxiety because zero anxiety isn't the right amount you want to be on you want to be a little Ed on edge yeah a little bit optimally optimally right just like you are when you're preparing to play a game with an optimal opponent right there's a challenge okay meaning curve meaning signifies the presence of an optimized challenge okay and that and and that meaning that's not the illusory consequence of a delusional belief designed to protect us from the anxiety of death instead that meaning is a signal that we're on the developmental Edge that will best prepare us for all challenges that we might confront in the future that's fine yes okay okay but that all right but that so in a hero story back to Becker in a hero Story the hero takes on something like a maximal challenge now Becker claimed that we identify with those heroes in an illusory manner to fortify ourselves against the anxiety of death sort of narcissistically elevating ourselves but but the the alternative view is that no as a proper Sojourner forward what we're doing is taking on exactly the optimized challenge that expands our skill that expands our knowledge that retools our maps and that makes us optimally prepared when all for the future even if all hell breaks loose that seems reasonable to you I I I mean I don't think we go through I don't think all these things we do in life is based on trying to deny death which is of course Becca's notion so I do agree with you I mean there is this sense of yes the challenge we like the Hero Stories we learn from them we kind of it life is not simply on a daily basis about denying death there's no point that we do I mean I think we frequently do deny death but it is not the essence of motivation which of course is what he would claim I'm so disagreeing with you that we that the challenge is extremely important in terms of moving forward both as individuals and as species you know so I don't disagree at all okay well and the the model that I talked about earlier the friston model the model that I worked on with my students as well the entropy control model it's also an interesting and compelling alternative to the death anxiety model because the fundamental enemy in the entropy model isn't death per se death is a consequence of unconstrained entropy too many things going wrong at once do you in right and so we're trying to constrain and regulate the chaos of our lives and we do that the question is how we do that well we can do that with auser and naive beliefs but they're subject to shattering or we can do that see so let let me offer you let me tell you I I I think the key to shattering is not that they're auser it's that they're Bedrock that that the that's the that's the the shattering of illusions at the upper level wouldn't matter I mean that would be very very unfortunate for dealing with everyday life but it wouldn't shatter our assumptions I mean that that you know right well I meant that they were a Los the only reason I meant that they were a losery is because they're susceptible to shattering under dire circumstances right that's all I meant that's right no yeah absolutely absolutely and they are to some extent blery because they're they tend to be positive right well they tend to be naively positive naely positive naive okay so so let me tell you another story this is a cool story so so there's a story at the end of The Exodus adventure and the reason I'm bringing these stories up is because I believe that the Assumption structure that we see the world through is a story and so I'm looking at the bottom of stories at the most fundamental stories okay why is are narratives I mean there's a very good there there's there's no question all Li are narratives right right right right yeah the question that's well and that's that's a hell of a thing to say because it it it it begs the question you know is life itself a narrative and that begs the question of whether reality itself is best construed as a narrative it seems to me that it's highly likely yeah well okay yeah I meant we live our lives as narratives when something doesn't fit we have to make the plot work right right so the Exodus story yes the ex story okay so yeah so there's a there's a there's an event that occurs at the end it's quite it's a remarkable story so the Israelites are theyve made it most of the way through the desert and they're but they're still bitching and whining and complaining they they're longing for the previous tyranny right so that's the previous set of assumptions they don't like to be lost which is where they are in the desert when they're assumptions are shattered yeah right that's exactly right the desert that desert sojourn is the shattered assumptions that are a consequence of leaving the tyan tyrannical State it's exactly what that repres I mean I I might not say they were traumatized I would say that they are but they are very anxious nevertheless go ahead they're lost they're lost that's right turn to mes and Aaron and yes okay right right they're lost and they're out of water in this scene okay and they get all about this they're sick of eating the food that they have and they're lost and they're hopeless and they're longing for tyranny and uh God gets tired of their complaining their faithlessness let's say their their their Rebellion against movement forward and he sends a bunch of poisonous snakes in to bite them and so the Israelites get bitten by all these poisonous snakes and they get kind of sick of it after a while and they go ask Moses who they know to have a connection with God to intercede and Moses agrees and he goes and has a chat with God and and then what should happen is that God calls off the poison the snakes and the Israelites move forward but that's not what happens and what happens instead is insanely profound and you know that healing symbol of the Physicians that's a staff with a serpent around it okay so this is one of the variants of that symbol okay so God tells Moses take the bronze of the Israelites and cast a staff so that's like the rod of tradition that's like the fundamental axiomatic assumption put that in the ground and on that put a bronze serpent and have all the Israelites look at this and if they look at it then the poison won't affect them anymore now this is a very interesting it's very interesting he because God could just call off the snakes but what but that isn't what he does he fortifies the Israelites against poison and he does that by voluntary exposure right okay like a verion therapy right precisely like that precisely like that and that's you know that's that is the therapeutic approach that approach of exposure that every single psychotherapeutic school has converged on in the last 100 years doesn't matter with the origin the psychoanalyst the cognitive psychologist the behaviorists the existentialists they all come to the same conclusion get your story straight and confront what challenges you that's the pathway to Redemption okay so here's a cool Twist on that story this is and this has to do with what beliefs are fundamental at the core not illusory in the gospels Christ says to his followers that unless he is lifted up like the serpent in the desert there is no possibility of redemption now this is a very weird narrative twist because first of all it begs a variety of questions the first question being why in the world would Christ refer back to that story the second question being why would he assimilate him himself to that figure it's very unlikely right a serpent on a pole okay so so this is the conclusion and this has to do with the validity of beliefs I believe and it's the antidote to the notion that we need illusion to survive so a snake is a pretty bad thing and a poisonous snake is worse and a poisonous snake in the midst of a desert is even worse but it's not the worst thing what's the worst thing that would be like a meta snake what's the worst possible thing well the worst possible thing is some something like an amalgam of the tragedies of life you could throw some malevolence in there just for spice right so the worst possible thing is the core of mortality and the fact of malevolence all right it's the full confrontation with that that's Illustrated in the gospel narrative and so no yeah okay well I'll just close with that and then I'll let you respond the the idea there it's something like this the idea there is that faith in your ability faith in the human ability to fully confront the limits of mortal experience and malevolence is the proper foundational Axiom and it allows for the it allows for the existence of evil right okay so that's right yeah yeah no I'm totally I mean so you know the that's right you're saying essentially that these these illusory or as you're saying naive beliefs at the fundamental level allow us to function in the real world that's right I mean I mean that's a very this is a very mundane way and and simplistic way of saying what you've been talking about but one of the things I do want to bring up is when we're talking about sort of things that are illusory um in part they're illusory because they're overgeneralizations okay if say the world is benevolent um you you have these beliefs part of it is just it's an O overgeneralization of in general things are right it doesn't take into account all the you know all the bad stuff that we know know happen but so at the fundamental level what we're talking about these overgeneralized beliefs when people actually end up managing and coping successfully with trauma they still end up having some beliefs that are essentially less overgeneralized they their beliefs that are positive that now can account for as you're saying the these negative events okay um but but but it's but it's interesting to talk about that cognitively we cannot as as you know all too well you know we all we cannot actually sort of respond to every single little thing in the world most of our beliefs and all of our knowledge involves some over estimation over generalization over abstra you know and when you get to that very top of that hierarchy then you may be the things may be very very specific right but the further down we move the greater the general the generalizations well and you're pointing out that I don't think there's any difference between noting the undifferentiated and overgeneralized quality of those initial beliefs and naivity that's the same thing it's it's the use of a it's a use of an insufficiently detailed map so the map the map that the or a or or a too optimistic and naive story so the problem with the belief structure that's a minimal to disruption by trauma is that it doesn't take into account the existence let's say of tragic Randomness and outright malevolence right and so and that works fine until you encounter it but it doesn't work at all once you do and once you encounter it having those beliefs actually enables people to actually rebuild the assumptions and you know the the only problem I have with the word naive and and even though it's I think sort of accurate is there is a kind of um almost person blaming victim blaming about V you know so naive T feels like um s sort of pejorative do you know what I'm saying as opposed to if we use the cognitive word over generalization instead it doesn't feel quite so negative but but yes in terms of but as a descriptor I think you're right it's naive that's right right you know okay well so that's that's interesting too because there this is an ancient argument right that that the difference between let's say ignorance and willful blindness right right and you can imagine that someone okay so let God let me let me tell you a story about that so okay but we will move to the other book sometime we will right I really need to know what you want what you think about it yeah yeah we'll do that we'll do that we'll do that right away maybe we'll just close with this this part with this Freud talked a lot about the edle relationship that was characterized by an overbearing maternal presence and too much dependence right now we know that people with dependent personality are more likely to be traumatized now but let me elaborate on that I'm I I I'm I'm not sure that's but okay we we'd have to deal with that's a whole different discussion because um that you're traumatized if you if you experience basically um sort of unusual out of the ordinary events right that that super challenge you but people who have the most people that already have negative assumptions actually often traumatized less I don't think the ne right I don't think the negative assumptions are a sign of more differentiated worldview right I'm not a fan of the notion could be part it also could be part of dependence you know dependent people but um but anyway go ahead I'm I'm sorry I apologize for interrup well that well let let's see if I could lay this out properly people people main maintain people maintain their undifferentiated viewpoints longer than they might because when they're faced with minor incidences of of uh disconfirming evidence they turn away they they don't process it right that's blind well but here's no not sure it's willful blindness let's say that is cognitive conservatism if we changed our cognitive schemas every time there was something that didn't fit it would be a problem right I mean um things have to things have to build up to change and that's what like you know look at scientific revolutions look at and stuff you know the notion that we're not going to make a change every second based on one disconfirming stuff I mean I actually love call popper you know the notion is we should be cognitively conservative when it comes to our schemas or our theories it should take a lot to turn them around but we should ultimately but we should ultimately be willing to turn them right that would be dependent on the degree of their axiomatic fundamental fundamental yes exactly so the notion should be that the deeper you go into the axiomatic structure the farther down you go the more absolutely overwhelming the evidence has to be in order to move that assumption yes absolutely agree okay okay and so so I think the cognitive conservatism that's that's that's something like the that's the stake in the ground right that's the that's the Bedrock of something like tradition or or cumulative experience yeah you can't let one deviation at at the periphery destroy the center right that's a catastrophic mistake but but so but it isn't only that people are unwilling to change their Central beliefs because they're cognitively conservative they're also prone to turning a blind eye even to repetitive information that indicates that there's an axiomatic error right no I look I mean I mean we could talk about politics now how we turn our you know no I was going to say just segueing the confirmation bias the you know we only want to listen to things on our side we don't want to actually be exposed to the other we we kind of live in our silos we confirm what we believe I mean this is part of uh part of how we live our lives unfortunately right um yes I totally agree you know the the fact that we want to confirm what we already believe and expose ourselves to stuff that will confirm it is a very a major part of how we construct and live our lives right right and that's not that's not well you tell me what you think about this that's not merely cognitive conservatism that's also active away from okay that's I that goes back to what you were saying earlier that's motivational right right that that's part of desire right well why first of all you know if we've organized ourselves politically we have somewhere convenient to put malevolence and it's not within us it's in the oppos of our ideological belief so that's a lovely thing to have plus we've organized the world in a relatively what would you call it um oversimplified Manner and that means we don't have to think and that we're on the side of virtue so you know that's pretty convenient as well let's talk about the political landscape then now so that that that takes us to your to your other major book yeah yeah that's yeah and actually that's the one that I that you know was recently published that's that's within the last few months as opposed to 30 years ago right right that's the two that's the two morali well well start why don't you why don't you lay that out first lay out your thesis and then we'll discuss that in some more detail and and and jump in when I overstate this or or go on too long um so um I um I do think that moral psychology is a very helpful lens and invaluable lens for understanding our political differences um so um let's start with motivation when when you know the the fundamental motivational distinction for people for humans is or for any for any animals approach and avoidance very simply pain pleasure we approach the good we want to avoid the bad okay um I am um I actually ended up using these two ways I first have to talk a little bit about morality and and my my understanding of the moral map a little to to move on to politics but have have have okay so um um if you think about Approach at avoidance I I sort of make a distinction IM morality between two kinds of morality one is prescriptive and one is prescriptive prescriptive is based in avoidance these are the things we shouldn't do you shouldn't lie you shouldn't steal you shouldn't cheat right we all know that right is that the same as that's proscriptive morality well conscious is sort of a is is a sort of a internal mechanism that allows us to know the rules and the norms and and pushes us in the right direction yes but proscriptive morality is about not doing the wrong thing it's it's based in inhibition constraint and so forth prescripted morality is doing the right thing it's a difference between not harming and helping right that's and and our default moralities based on interpersonal interactions who we're interacting with don't harm IE don't steal don't lie don't cheat and help right be kind respect others you know help right now that difference and by the way motivationally they're they're not not harming and helping are not the same thing they're not just opposite sides of the same coin they're opposite in many ways the child who doesn't you know is told not to take somebody else's toys and doesn't take the toys isn't necessarily good at sharing his or her own right so so the prescriptive and the prescrip are really quite different and in fact children learn Pro gift morality the do not much more readily quicker than more quickly than the the does okay in M i' I've mapped the mor moral domain based on that and I'm not going to go through the personal and interpersonal domain what I want to move to is the group domain the so group-based moralities that are proscriptive or prescriptive proscriptive morality the Shand for that is protect protect from harm okay the morality of protecting from harm versus providing for wellbe okay instead of proscriptive and prescriptive they're very wordy words right so um let's think about morality as rules and and and Norms that facilitate group living in part they're based on protecting from harm the group protecting the group from harm in this case and providing for the group those are the two basic um tasks for group living right defending and and and and and providing and when I've looked at this the the these two moralities um which by the way I should also argue motivationally what is the what is the most difficult part of do not if your tempt Temptation has to be inhibited in the case of the proscriptive or the protect the enemy of prescript morality the providing is not having to Tamp something down it's not Temptation it's apathy it's not caring right um so what I've what I what I what I uh have if you look at liberals and conservatives they don't differ in terms of how much they think you should be helping or or they may say you should help different people but you know both groups believe you shouldn't harm and you shouldn't steal and lie and cheat and you should help your neighbor and you should be kind and respect other people where you start seeing huge differences is the group-based morality which um in the case of a proscriptive group Gates morality the protect protecting the group looks like social order you what people are after is social order stability and security of the group and in the case of um a more of a prescriptive it looks like social justice providing for the group so everybody is is cared for a shared communal responsibility so we have this social order and social justice which are quite different but it turns out those are not correlated they're negatively correlated every other area of um morality uh protecting and and and providing are highly correlated okay so I want to move to this how did you how did you determine that they weren't correlated well because we took large samples of of of self-described uh liberals and conservatives okay and you can see what they they support for these various um beliefs belief social order we have there are con constructs that underly that and we you know have I mean unfor in the book we talk about all the confirming fact all the all the statistics but what what's important for me to go back for one moment is I actually believe that both liberal liberalism and conservatism are morally based now I'm on the left so um but I believe very strongly that liberals and conservatives have to work together to preserve our system I do believe said why you said why in some sense right because you need order and you need provision you need order and in in many ways um you cannot you we're not going to preserve a democracy with just half the country you know opting for it right I mean if you look at any presidential election about half the the country votes Democrat and half a republican now I do want to put a disclaimer here you know I do think that the people that wield these ideologies are not necessarily moral and I want to say that you know M if you are a magga conservative where the core of your political belief now is based in a a big lie I'm not opting for I'm not saying that these are moral I I I'm already precluding moral morality there okay but I think there are huge numbers of conservatives in our country that um and your country as well right are you Canadian correct no I'm Canadian Canadian right use lots of of conservatives that I disagree with probably in terms of policy but I'd be happy to sit down and talk about it we'd find out there are lots of things that we' agree about okay um we'd find out that we' both care about family who care about Community I you know Li Chene is a great example of this I everybody I know on the left says I'd be happy to sit down with li keni she has Integrity I don't agree with her about any policy but she has proven that she is a person that's moral okay so I want to take I I do want to say I I'm not talking about the Maga conservatives right now um I um we only have to go to the global party system Global party survey of 20 International um with 2,000 experts on parties at elections who now have claimed that our Republican party in in the US is an alt-right party it is no longer considered a mainstream Republican party the Democrats are considered a mainstream Liberal Party um so you know we're now talking about a party that isn't even really a mainstream conservative party so I but let's put all of that aside all right um there is a reason to believe that um half the half the world half the US half a Canadian probably are tend towards a conservative half tend toward a liberal these are not I don't believe as Hibbing and his colleagues do that the that politics is inherited I do think there are some temperamental differences early on that can lead people to One Direction or another you know all the literature on threat sensitivity for conservatives that's threat we talk about that as if that's necessarily a bad thing that's not necessarily bad somebody has to be sort of alert for threat right we know when you look at um ey tracking for example studies conservatives are more likely to look at the negative Etc Liberals are more likely to look at the positive or at least don't differentiate Liberals are more uh the psychological um attribute that defines liberals is openness so you have openness versus a sensitivity to threat um these do lead to very different kinds of policies and concerns okay there's no question uh unfortunately you know I think a lot of social order could could in fact if you have an interest in social order you could actually believe in working towards greater equality which basically is um really uh would help social order a great deal but in fact what most conservative moved towards in in in instead are abortion social issues ises abortion and uh samesex marriage and you know doctor assisted suicide and prohibitions these are in based on constraint and they are based on prohibition that's exactly right which is prescriptive um yeah I'm sorry so go yes well so so that well that's I I want to make sure that I'm I've got the argument exactly right here and so let me lay out what you said and tell me if I've got it correct the best evidence that I know of for distinguishing between conservatives and liberals is temperamental right the liberal types the progressive types are higher in openness and lower in conscientiousness especially orderliness right and then the conservatives are the reverse of that low in openness and high in conscientiousness especially orderliness and so they see less possibility in potential compared to the Liberals which is why the Liberals tend to be open border types because they see beyond the constraints something like potential that can be creatively engaged with whereas the conservatives are more likely to think no that's a place where all hell can break loose and the problem is well the problem is they're both right because what's beyond you can be very promising and engaging and what's beyond you can do you in so well yeah well let's think about what what would be the attributes that that you know conservative would be looking for strength and power okay you're talking about threat you know trying to to protect protect from the group right strength and power um socially defined roles so everybody knows what where they fit you know for stability uh tradition is looked at and culture you know as as markers um to uh fight self-interest etc etc um conser liberalism doesn't really doesn't that's not what liberalism is about at all liberalism is about equality greater equality for groups you know providing resources for f for for groups very different kinds of Interest here liberalism wants regulation liberals want regulation in the economic domain right we want people to have to we we believe in sort of entitlements that help people you know with Social Security and and and Welfare if you need food and um you know believe in great trying to establish greater equality right right that's the economic domain conservatives actually really more are more interested in unfettered um capitalism right UNF the unfettered econ economy they want autonomy in the economic domain conservatives given the interest in socially defined roles culture tradition and so forth they focus on Norm adherence strong Norm adherence Norm adherence and and strict roles really is a social domain they want um regulation around things like abortion and and same-sex marriage and things of this sort and and they want and they want aut and they want autonomy you know was we have policies that are completely Mirror Image one group wants regulation in economics liberals and the other wants autonomy there and conservatives want regulation in Social domain and liberals want autonomy there so you get this crazy thing which is why people have always said why is it that conservatives really you know they want to be so strict about abortion but you know don't touch the economy well of course it's not their domain it's you see it's not where the morality the morality doesn't touch that for them that's it's not a relevant domain so okay so let me ask you well that's okay that's okay let me ask you this um I'll put a good word in for the conservatives um I know I know you have been doing that as well with regards to the necessity of Maintenance of social order but there's also another difference that seems to me striking and I don't think the conservatives are very good at playing this up the reason that the conservatives with Integrity want autonomy in economic matters is so that individuals rather than the state can bear the responsibility for provision right well why is but why is that okay I understand the argument but there why is that better people here's the thing the conservative Mantra is equal opportunity equal opportunity I get so very tired of hearing that because you never have equal opportunity if people are not starting at the same place right what's equal opportunity if somebody has a lot of money they've inherited from their parents and somebody has nothing you say's equal opportunity there's not it's like running a race with some people starting you know a lap ahead you know um so even this notion of individuals should be responsible it's not that liberals don't think that it matter not just individual it's not just individual don't believe that that I I that I mean you're right people are also responsible but you know you it's a I love you know the the the notion that picking people up by their own bootstraps and how important that is and you go back to Martin Luther King and he says well you know some people don't even have boots you know it's important to remember that we just you know we heard we start in very different places based on social policies in the past right so um it's not as if people who work hard shouldn't also do well it's that lots of people who work very hard still can't get ahead so it you know it this notion of individuals should be responsible for those who can make it without the help great but you want I think I believe in communal you know sharing and communal sharing communal responsibility I believe in that you know maybe that's that is a liberal belief that it's not each person for him or herself and you make her to you bra or you break it's that we have a responsibility to each other we're in this game together we go around once in life you know help each other and that includes having a system government right that's that's what we got helping those who need it I you know and I don't think that's inconsistent with people also working hard right this is what I this is what I would recommend for for the time being I think we should continue this discussion of the political on The Daily wire plus side no I'm happy to do that yeah let's do that let's do that and so so that's that's a that's a reasonable we've we've we covered a lot of material that's a reasonable place to draw this part of the of the conversation to an end

behind the dailywire plus platform paywall and so if you want to join us there please do and we'll hash out some more of our discussion with regards to conservatism and liberalism um thank you very much Dr janof yeah is it sorry yanof bman Jan no it is J janof Bowman Ron janof okay yes okay uh and and uh yeah thank you very much for walking me through your your thoughts on shattered assumptions and your your political ideas we're going to continue that and uh thank you to the film crew here in Scottsdale for making this possible and to the Daily wire plus people for putting this all together and feel free everyone join us yeah yeah and and the film crew here yes right right so thank you and we'll take five and we'll reestablish contact on The Daily wire plus side all right bye everybody
