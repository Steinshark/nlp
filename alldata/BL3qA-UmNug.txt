ever have a project idea or business idea but no one seems to get your vision for it you spend so much time explaining what this is going to do how this is going to be different why they need to help you with this project or maybe it's just you focusing on the project and you just have trouble envisioning the end result today I'm going to share with you some of the best tools to help you build your projects faster whether you are a designer a coder maybe you are neither you're non-technical you are a product manager these tools will still benefit you I'm going to share with you tools that will take your designs to code automatically generating code to helping you find really unique domains creating logos and so much more these are some of my favorite tools that I personally love to use and they've really helped my workflow speed up my workflow from ideation to actually building a physical well virtual product also you know I got to say this before we get into it hit that subscribe button for more future tech tech plus All Tech future Tech you know what I mean coding career all the good stuff uh videos leave in the comments any other topics you want me to cover any questions you have I love you all so much I can't tell you how much fun I have creating these videos for you and connecting with you all so thank you all for your support okay enough of that sappy stuff let's get [Music] started coming in at number one you might have heard of it before I would say it's one of the more popular uh tools out right now that will turn your designs into code so you can use this tool to turn your uh figma file or yeah mainly figma file into react code CSS it is mindblowing so let's go into what does LOI looi have to offer well first thing what I found really interesting about it when I was playing around with it is how quick it works so it's a plug-in that you can integrate into figma and I am someone who is not a great designer but it was really cool to see how this came to life from idea to actual code this is by no means production level code in the sense that after you are complete this you'll still need there are so many missing pieces from this project but the fact that you can now Lean On Tools like this to generate at least starter code for you I think is such a win in the right direction so with loopy you can actually export your code really simply uh one of the examples that I see that they use a lot is with typescript so it's very upto-date modern coating practices which I think is really key too oh okay I got to take this off you can see by my face it is really warm in here I don't have allergies but my nose is getting so red all right that feels better let's go to number two okay next on the list is if you are like me and CSS is one of the hardest things to achieve I don't know what it is I just don't have the patience for it or the eye for it I don't know the design I'm just always like never perfect one of the things that I recently discovered here it's on my computer actually it's called CSS scan or get CSS scan that's a lot of esset and it's really cool because it's completely free and you can literally just choose what uh box Shadow you want to use which if you have done box Shadows before you know there are so it's not just one box Shadow there are so many to choose from so this is a great place to start you literally just copy it click on it copy it and then you can paste it into your project that simple this I know who thought you'd get so excited about box Shadows but you do okay so so far we have been able to turn our figma designs into code react code or whatever the cas is then we were able to you know customize it a bit further with CSS box Shadows we need a logo we're building a company we need a logo you need a logo so here is where I would go it's called Luca Luca l o k how do I pronounce that leave in the comments and what it will do is it is an AI platform that will generate unique unque logos for your brand I think this is really cool because all you need to do is input what you are looking for what your brand name is and it will generate different options for you to choose from this is I think a game changer I remember when I was creating the Tiffin Tech logo and I went back and forth so many times with the graphic designer on this and it was great he was phenomenal but if I would have been able to I would have saved so much time and worked so much quicker by just being able to use a tool like this so I think there's a lot that you can really lean into here now there is it does cost you this tool is not free I should say that um I do believe there is a free version that you can test it out and play around with it but it is a great tool for anyone looking to really dive into creating a logo which honestly I didn't realize how important or stressful finding the right logo is so I hope this helps you okay coming in at number four is uard it's like lizard but with a you we got to put up on screen here I'm horrible today at pronouncing names youer let's go with that and that's similar to kind of similar to the first one where we spoke about which was turning your designs into code but there is so much more I find that this one can do uh than just the specific plugin for figma it's really incredible so let's go through the website here so you can see here there is design there is wire Framing mockups and prototyping so even AI design let's go there and you can see what you can do is literally select what device you are going to be designing for input what you are going for from there it will output the actual design I don't know this is pretty wild to me is someone who really struggles with Design This is it really takes it to the next level and then there's also wireframe which I think is really interesting where you can put a sketch of your wireframe that you are literal sketch like pen and paper and from there you can input it into the system and you will see the output so this is really interesting I think this is a super cool tool especially for anyone who has this idea and they want this first prototype when they are going to investors or want to share with it share your idea with others you can get it to the point where people can really visualize this beautiful app that you want to build or beautiful website or company whatever the case may be okay next on the list is called chroma and this is going to be your favorite tool when it comes to finding a color palette and once again similar to I find with logos you don't really realize how important this is until you start a business bus or you're building a website or even your own portfolio and you're like this needs to flow this doesn't make sense so it's really interesting you can play around with chroma for free and on the page where you can generate uh your your color palette and whatnot you actually have to start by picking 50 colors which I got to be honest with you I didn't love that experience but it makes sense why here's what they say these colors will be used to train a color generator algorithm personalized to you so for best results choose a wide variety of hues values and saturations so this is kind of fun uh because I I don't know I felt like it was who am I what colors am I going to choose I don't know maybe I went too deep with this one but it was a really fun tool to play around with and it is in beta so it's not fully you know out to the world launched and you know they're they're addressing that there are some bugs and whatnot in it but I think it's such a cool tool to use and you can save your collections search through different collections they also will turn or generate each of the colors that come out for your collection into CSS code which I think is really cool too go check it out chroma chroma okay this next one I actually used a lot I never have selected one of the options that they generated though but it was super handy so you know when you are going to buy a URL and you have this great business idea or name or project idea name and you're like oh the URL is going to be T like the domain is going to be taken what is the point how am I going to get creative here this tool is for you and I get so excited because the amount of times this has happened to me it's just like ridiculous so what you can do with this tool it's called only one second I got put my computer in front of me it's called onlyc com.com I know it sounds kind of like something else onlyc com.com and uh so what you can do is describe your project so an online platform that allows users to create and book customized walking tours with local guides like get very specific about what your project you working on is from there you click on find available domains and it will share with you not only domains that are available based on what you described but other ideas for you like okay because your project focuses on this here's a potential suggested domain for you to use also too it's kind of cool you can go to random idea and it will input a random project idea and then generate domains for you based on that which I mean you could kind of work backwards if you are someone who's looking to build more projects and uh you just don't know what to build this is also a great tool so onlyc com.com it's really fun and it's free I don't know I'd pay money for this this is great okay it is getting dark you can see I have my light on this is what living in Canada does it means that like 5:30 p.m. it is getting dark which is just wild and not right but that's okay I hope you enjoyed this video and going through some of my favorite tools I lean on a lot of these in various cap various yeah various capacities uh because they really help make my workflow a lot easier I know some of us are more focused on not using any of these tools because we're too cool for them or whatever but honestly leaning on tools that can help you H improve your workflow and recognizing what areas that you might not be strongest in I think is so key if you are a really great coder but maybe you're not a great designer why not lean on one of these tools that will help you be a better designer and vice versa maybe you're an incredible designer you have these amazing figma files but you don't want to learn code or spend a ton of time so you generate using something like locy to generate code for you now I mean it goes without saying there are still steps needed to be taken to get this production level ready but what this does is it brings your idea to life that's the first step let's not try and go from step one to step 100 of uh you know this idea to creating the next Facebook let's just take it step by step and these tools will help you do so all right now that it is 5:30 or 6 or whatever time it is I got to go make dinner and feed the dogs thanks everyone I will see you all soon [Music] [Music] bye
