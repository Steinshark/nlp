hello everyone and welcome in this video we are going to be demonstrating the differences between two winter tires one with studs and one without so here's what happened subaru was kind enough to invite me to drive their sti and brz on a frozen lake in wisconsin and happily i accept it i'm not one to say no to sliding on ice but rather than just some glamorous shots of me pretending that i know what i'm doing in cold temperatures i thought it'd be really neat to collect some data and see if we could learn some differences between studded and studless winter tires we'll be running acceleration runs braking runs and even a small timed course to learn the traction differences between the tires so for the purposes of this video all of the demonstrations will be using two identical subaru stis both of these stis are completely stock with the exception of wheels and tires and they're both using the exact same wheels so the only difference between them is one has an off-road use only studded winter tire and the other has a street legal studless winter tire you can think of this comparison a lot like comparing a high performance summer tire to a dedicated track tire just on the opposite end of the temperature spectrum our studded tire is a lappy winter tire 225 millimeters wide a 40 aspect ratio sidewall and mounted on 18 inch method race wheels this tire has 414 studs per tire the studs have a full length of 12.5 millimeters but the effective length is four millimeters the distance that sticks out past the rubber of the tire these are extremely aggressive studded tires on a road car the studs could protrude from the rubber less than half as much and road tires might have between 130 to 250 studs per tire rather than over 400 having more longer studs means even better traction on ice and for our studless tire we're running bridgestone blizzak ws90 tires in the exact same size 225 over 40 r18 as the studded tire i specifically chose these as they are one of today's best performing studless winter tires the ws90 is the successor to the ws-80 tire one of tyrex's highest rated winter tires so it should be able to perform even better i've personally ran ws-80 tires through many winters and in my experience it has provided excellent traction much like continental's viking contact 7 michelin's icex or nokian options so ultimately we've got a very good studded tire versus a very good studless tire the studless tire gets its grip from a clever compound that remains flexible in very cold conditions has deep tread depth for capturing snow you might be surprised to learn that snow on snow traction is actually pretty decent so these treads hold snow to improve traction and also through the use of sipes the small slotted zigzags in the tread block which create an additional biting edge to help the tire fine grip on slippery surfaces the studded tire will use many similar principles but add on top of it metal studs to punch into the ice and ideally provide additional traction so let's get right into it for the purposes of consistency yours truly won't be doing any of the driving that task will be handled by none other than patrick sandell an accomplished rally driver from sweden who currently drives for subaru's rally team usa in the number 18 wrx sti i'll be sitting in the passenger seat providing useless advice and jotting down any data collected we'll be using a v box to record information and since all of this is happening on a frozen lake there's great gps reception as there aren't many tall obstacles around our first test is breaking from 30 miles per hour or about 50 kilometers per hour down to zero as all of this testing is on a frozen lake the deceleration testing will be occurring on nearly pure ice without much snow on the surface putting grip at a very near minimum for any tire each run will occur in the same spot as much as is possible with the braking engaged at about 35 miles per hour and data recorded from 30 miles per hour down to zero all of the braking will be at full abs meaning the computer is doing most of the work providing our best stopping distance and consistent results first up are the studless tires and we'll do three runs in each test to ensure we have consistent results so here we go our first run saw a 30 mile per hour down to zero braking distance of 179 feet the average over three separate runs was 182 feet as a comparison today's best braking cars are capable of coming to a stop from 30 miles per hour in less than 30 feet on dry pavement we're at six times that distance but remember we're on flat slick ice a summer tire in these conditions would continue breaking well well past 180 feet and it's also important to distinguish between ice and snow breaking on a separate run we started braking later allowing for the car to get on just a little bit of snow towards the end of the braking zone and stopping distance improved significantly to 164 feet with just a small amount of snow on the surface so how did the studded tires fare quite impressive actually the average from 3 30-0 runs was 92 feet with the best run at 87 feet overall it was capable of stopping in about half the distance i asked patrick the rally driver for his thoughts one of the points he wanted to make very clear was that while studs make an incredible difference while driving on ice the traction difference on snow is a smaller gap having the studs able to drive into the hard icy surface is a lot more beneficial than if they're cutting into fluffy snow and another note worth mentioning these studless tires had approximately 20 miles of break-in driving put on them this helps to remove any of the tire mold release residue that might be still on the tire that said some companies will claim it can take up to 500 miles for a tire to be fully broken in so the studless tires could see a slight improvement in results over time so how did our tires fare in acceleration testing this is a bit more challenging of a demonstration to remain consistent on so we came up with a plan on how to keep results as close as possible first we decided on a no slip launch patrick would do his best to ease onto the throttle for minimum tire slip while i would call out the vehicle speed to him once we'd reached 10 miles per hour i'd let him know at which point he'd shift to second gear and finish the run up to 30 miles per hour our studless tire acceleration runs yielded average results of hitting 30 miles per hour in 9.3 seconds this is actually a pretty decent number considering our average braking time from 30 miles per hour was 8.6 seconds the best run on studless tires was just under 9 seconds running the exact same style with the studded tires shift at 10 miles per hour and remain in second pass 30 our studded tires were able to accelerate on average in just 4.8 seconds an improvement versus studless of 4.5 seconds the results were pretty consistent with the fastest studded run hitting 30 in 4.7 seconds now since these tires had studs something i couldn't help but wonder was if this was really the fastest way to 30 miles per hour or if an aggressive start could yield better times so now instead of trying to prevent wheel slip wheel slip became the goal an aggressive throttle application dumping the clutch and seeing just how fast the 0-30 time can get turns out with studs this made a significant difference our average of 3 runs saw a 0-30 time of 4.2 seconds and our best time was under 4 seconds this method was over half a second faster than a controlled minimal slip launch we're not limited by static friction since the tire studs dig into the surface of the ice increasing the thrust forward how cool but now in the name of science of course we had to try the same method with the studless tires much to our surprise it actually worked really well the average acceleration time dropped from 9.3 seconds down to 7.4 seconds with the best run at 6.8 it seems even without studs there's enough digging from the studless tires into the surface that the tire slip improve the overall force at the ground really impressive to see as it goes against what i intuitively expected to happen so overall our best studded time was 4 seconds versus our best studless time of 6.8 seconds a difference of 2.8 seconds so now we get to our final demonstration which ties it all together and adds the additional element of lateral grip the track test this is a small low speed windy course that's about a third of a mile or a little over half a kilometer again patrick will be doing all of the driving three laps with each tire set and all once again be in the passenger seat the final displayed lap times will come directly from counting camera frames first up we'll watch his best lap on the studless tires now watching this i want to make sure it's clear why it appears so slow and not all that flashy the fastest way around an ice course actually looks quite slow there's not much sliding not much drifting minimal steering inputs and you're simply trying to find the straightest path from one corner to the next just like you would on a regular track the challenge of course is that traction is so low so while it may not look all that impressive visually patrick's driving was actually super precise utilizing left foot braking to ensure the front end has proper traction and occasionally light feedback to the handbrake to help rotate the car if the front end isn't pointing correctly his first go around on the steadless tire was his fastest lap at 59.6 seconds from start to finish with an average over three runs of 60.2 seconds next up the studded tires immediately you'll notice it gets off the line quicker one of the interesting things about driving on ice is that your inputs are delayed so you're anticipating what's coming up ahead and acting in advance turning the wheel applying throttle there's a lag before the car actually does what you want it to do so you have to anticipate what's coming up ahead the whole time and have the car wheels pointed in the correct direction accordingly as you can see the studded tires are helping significantly with speed especially in icy patches however in the snowy portions of the track the speed differential is less significant his top speed on the studless tires was 33 miles per hour while on the studded tires he was able to hit 38 miles per hour 5 miles per hour faster his fastest lap was 52.2 seconds with an average time of 52.4 seconds on average he was nearly eight seconds faster per lap with the studded tires the eight-second gap is quite significant but it also shows when the surface has a bit of snow on it the advantage is reduced versus pure ice for example the studless tire took nearly an additional one hundred percent extra stopping distance to break from thirty to zero however they were only about 15 percent slower on the track demonstration now after patrick's laps i couldn't help but wonder how much faster he is than say someone without a racing history someone who spends much of their time debating the theoretical and doodling on a whiteboard someone who got gray hair too early and yet still wonders if facial hair will ever arrive yes with patrick riding shotgun i shot out in attempts to gain glory for engineers around the world now mind you before we witness the result i'm ready to dish out excuses first off i had never driven this course in this car we're watching my second run on it out of the two that i ran total my biggest fault was not anticipating what lies ahead better and instead reacting too late with my inputs this kept my top speeds down a bit and patrick had better exit points during his lap but mostly i feared being slower with studs than patrick without studs that'd be embarrassing much to my delight i crossed the finish line in 55.2 seconds this was exactly three seconds shy of patrick's best time but more importantly to my fragile ego five seconds faster than his average studless tire time thank goodness so what did we learn well ultimately studded tires can make a significant improvement in winter traction conditions but at the same point i was really impressed with how well the studless tires did on the course for snow driving i'm going to happily continue to use studless winter tires on my road going cars and as usual simply maintain a safe distance from the car ahead of me allowing for extra time to stop in the event of emergencies and maybe just let the tail slide out a little bit more thanks to this exceptional experience with subaru thank you all so much for watching and if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below
