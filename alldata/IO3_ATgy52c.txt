are you guys ready for gaming night yeah yeah are you guys ready for dad troubleshoots our broken theater room night at least that's what would have happened if MSI didn't sponsor me to come in on my sick day and show you guys the Trident X2 when I downgraded my gaming rig to an a770 for the Intel Arc 30 day challenge I realized pretty quickly that none of my long distance optical cables were working on it which means that all of a sudden I went from having a computer that could sit in a central location but be used in my office or the land room or the theater to having a computer that was just in a central location and that's it no way to get a signal to the other rooms in the house thankfully MSI sent over this monster with an RTX 49d core I9 3900 KF and a a touch screen um okay so there's clearly more to this than just having the fastest Hardware let's see if we can get gaming Knight back on and see if msi's cooling can survive in a stuffy AV cabinet is it technically cheating on the arc challenge if I add a whole new PC to the house that wasn't there when Luke and I made the switch to Intel that's going to be for the judges to decide just kidding there are no judges or points because everything in this challenge is made up just to frustrate me so I'm not actually allowed to keep this thing but I do get to experience what 4K 120 hertz projector gaming would be like on the fastest machine money can buy and then experience the disappointment of ripping it away from my adoring children uh let's take a closer look starting with what the heck is going on with this screen here once we get past the fancy boot animation and get to the desktop it's full of all kinds of interesting things temperatures frequencies fan speeds and even an FPS counter which I have my doubts about whether it would be accurate or not but I guess we'll see soon enough oh wow look at that hey it totally does work huh it shows you what I know MSI calls this thing the HMI 2.0 it's four and a half inches has a resolution of 480 by 800 allows you to adjust input and output volume you can set shortcuts to launch games and gaming mode switch power profiles free up Ram which is not necessary by the way but hey you can do it and you can control your RGB what I'm interested in though is changing it to a custom video hey it's so cool that's not really the most practical thing so I'm going to switch back over to hardware monitor mode and I'm going to focus on temperatures and then let's get a stress test running and see how high we can push this thing let's give her 20 threads of prime 95 small fft what we're really going to do while we wait for it to heat up is unstuffyify this cabinet truthfully it's not that bad because I did know that I was going to be putting some pretty high performance stuff in here when I designed the cabinet these meshes are quite open and all the shelves are actually mesh as well with the idea being that air would kind of be passively drawn in the bottom and then we could exhaust out the top but if we don't actually have any fans then we're not really going to be exhausting anything so that's where these noctuates come in how to actually Mount them though is another question in a perfect world we would want large fans spinning out a very low RPM so that if we can hear them it's a very low hum and unlikely to be audible over the sound of the projector in terms of mounting what I had in mind as inelegant as it might be is to just use these silicone noise isolator grommet things that noctua includes with their fans and just kind of hope that my two fans would kind of line up with the holes I wouldn't describe this as perfect but it's actually surprisingly good oh yeah I mean that's not that no uh well No One's Gonna notice that right if anyone asks me I'm going to make up some audio file bullets what the dang it it happened again ah these shelf holders are not the right size and I I'm fine also I think I put all these on wrong because I'm gonna have the power coming from the top obviously and I went around them down here okay I'm so annoyed I told them I told them I was like uh hey those don't seem right it seems like they're not gonna hold and I was like oh it seems fine I was like I really don't think so it's not even right oh shoot no no no no um oh my gosh come on seriously no these are still in so this is good oh my gosh move just oh okay nope stop why you fall we're good yeah Cable Management shelves happy get out of here oh I finally caved bought an Apple TV why fantasian yeah they got one of the original creators of Final Fantasy VI which is my favorite and he did this new game it's in this like super unique visual style like a really apparently it's like a really classic style RPG so I'm super excited to play it and finally at long last there it is power for the fans that was that the whole point of all of that I think I put that one in the wrong s oh stop why because I have other components in here that are going to generate heat as well like there could be an Xbox or a PlayStation here down the line not to mention the AV receiver I want these fans running all the time but I want them running at a pretty low RPM so this little power brick here that I was cable managing in before and the shelves fell haha we got minus we made things drop on him haha anyway the point is this runs to a Molex connection that I'm going to be running into one of these handy dandy little fan Splitters this is very old school fan control what you're looking at is these white ones are 5 volt and these yellow ones are 12 volt and then I'm going to take my two Banks of fans and I'm actually gonna go five volt here hope that these under volt gracefully they're not to us they should and theoretically I just have to kind of cable manage this across the top but it should be pretty tidy look at that let's go see how the computer's doing and then we're gonna throw it in here very nice there's actually some other things that the screen can do MSI sent over their Optics MPG 321 Ur Dash QD monitor so it's 4K 144hz quantum dot uh with a number of gaming oriented features night vision uh on-screen Crosshair optic scope Zoom effect and color profile switching but the thing that I want to show you guys is that you can actually control the OSD for this monitor through the Trident X2 screen why anyone would want to control it here when they can just control it here is sort of Beyond me especially considering that you can also use the MSI gaming intelligence app to change all this stuff with like a mouse which is faster and better but hey I'm sure there's a reason it's definitely different same goes for the guts it just takes three screws to get access to it and it's immediately obvious that what we're looking at here is an Australian PC meaning that it uses an inverted layout with the GPU on top and the CPU on the bottom it's also matx which was clearly intended to help keep the size under control I mean it's still big but when your GPU is the size of a small vehicle there's only so much you can do about that now msi's take on the inverted layout concept it's called Silent Storm and it has three zones the least obvious but most straightforward zone is on our thousand watt power supply the fan draws air in through the bottom of the case and the only place that it can escape is out the back see you later heat the top down to GPU that I pointed out earlier is the next zone now I know the RTX 4090 is a massive card but it's not actually this big this piece up here is a plastic shroud that MSI added above the GPU fans to make sure that all of the life providing cool air that's coming in through this top mesh is going straight to the GPU heatsink right here in practice the Shroud actually didn't make much of a difference to cooling once we reached a heat soak State we sent it over to the lab for testing but it isn't harming anything and shout out to their support bracket at the the rear of the card because this thing is not going to Sag and we had no concerns about it coming loose during shipping finally we've got the CPU Zone down here for our core I9 3900 KF a chip that will gladly use all of the thermal Headroom that's available to it and ours did just that while also managing to stay well clear of thermal throttling I'm also liking this super open mesh giving the ah here it is I kind of moved it radiator a clear path to blast hot air out of the case other notable inclusions are the two terabyte m.2 SSD hidden under the GPU dual extra two and a half inch slots for SATA SS more m.2 slots including one of them that's super easy to access here on the back kind of like the PlayStation you take off the little cover and then you just plug it in right down there and an additional three and a half inch hard drive slot if you want to add more bulk storage down the road we've also got Wi-Fi 6E and two and a half gig Lan and I guess that's all you really need to know let's go ahead and get this thing connected shoot what on Earth are we going to do if I don't have a shelf holder that is going to allow me to put this thing in here well let's find out oh no um okay this is really not my finest cable management work so the HDMI output is at the top and I need to be careful not to touch any of these shelves because if I do they might fall over I just want to put this here CPU pillows lttstore.com look they look like CPUs cute I'm also going to put this bean bag here so if the computer comes flying off the shelf it'll at least hit something soft hello hello oh my goodness come unplugged now I have hope and okay this is not a good sign hey hey there we go I don't even know what happened but for whatever reason my receiver wasn't playing nicely and now it is so haha yes yes oh yeah oh yeah all right oh you saw the HDR kick in there hey Brandon and this is with the house lights on and you shining a light at the screen Brandon not bad eh also this game runs so well on the 40 90. I can't even believe it this looks freaking awesome give me your car fight me copper ow ow ow stop dang it yeah pretty sick hey so there is absolutely no reason to use any setup other than this for gaming at this point oh man I was making that look real good for a bit there ow ow what are the cops firing at me for well that's what happens buddy this looks freaking awesome msi's Trident PCS used to be so small that you could hide them away in the ceiling tiles but it's pretty clear with the amount of heat they're managing and the amount of performance this thing packs that they had to shake things up a little bit oh man yeah it's pretty it's pretty great you're so right we were thinking about what to get our kids for Christmas I'm sitting here going everything I as a kid could have ever possibly wanted is already in this house what Christmas looking pretty good MSI it looks like gaming Knight can proceed as planned top of the line Hardware good cooling great looking chassis and there's a touch screen as well and now that we've got the exhaust set up actually oh yeah how are we doing for temps oh we're at like 65 and 72. not bad if you guys enjoyed this video you might also enjoy the more detailed look we took at the theater room and all the things that had to come together to get as good of a viewing experience as we're getting right now foreign
