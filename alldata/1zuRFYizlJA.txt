if you just want to write rust and you don't care about becoming some sort of rust Guru or related to Russ or building some sort of uh like public ident identity like associated with rust and I think most of the things it made like 90 plus percent of the stuff related to rust Foundation drama is just or like Associated teams I understand Chris IO isn't rust foundation so like it's just a shorthand but then that's pretty much like it doesn't matter for you so you shouldn't care it shouldn't let you it shouldn't let you uh prevent you from like learning rust or making something in Rust that's uh they're completely unrelated for most people I like that I like that that's good kind of initial take I kind of try to say that because I always get I get this whisper down constantly which is well thank you I appreciate that which is should I stop learning rust because of this and it's like no you shouldn't stop learning rust you just gotta remember that that's the people that you're gonna deal with at some level so how far do you wish to take him are you building a cool CLI tool or are you really trying to speak at conferences and like trying to like set up shop here you got to kind of Define which one you want or even like you're just making your own business and it's built on Rust I don't think you need to worry about it because they yeah there's effectively no mechanism today where they could stop you from consuming rust and using every new feature or whatever right correct I don't I don't think you need to be worried about like that in the sense but if it was like oh what I'm gonna primarily do is I want to be an open source rust developer who publishes things on crates okay well and like my primary income is through like sponsors okay that's a you you may now actually be concerned I'm not saying that you couldn't do that still right I'm just saying like now it becomes something that you want to consider and think about a little bit more yeah all right I think that's good that's why I always think like if you want to do if you want to do if rust is the product I think you got a lot of concerns if rust is just the language you're using I don't think you have any concerns yes uh they're like with the mild caveat of if you feel like the things are getting so egregious that it's going to destroy the community then you would be concerned but I don't really think that it has like reached that level by any means like I think people are still going to write rust I think people still like rust I I honestly think that if if o camel really is as good as I think it could be I think that will do more having a normal Community with normal policies and normal and just like you know everything about I could see that doing way more damage to rust than all their crappy decisions yeah yeah I think the the other thing too is like talking about the things that you find uh I don't know why you say questionable or difficult or maybe outright bad like the range of those things in public about the foundation or whatever I think that those are like that's good I don't know some people are like well you're just trashing rust well that's only true if you're actually like not having a reasonable take or not explaining your concerns because if you just don't say anything then they will just keep doing the thing that you don't like so talking about what at least how it feels to see some of the changes in crisis.org what it seems or some of the people who like I who actually know things about Russ like Steve koblanik like then I think that that's a good like that's good for the community it's not bad to say you don't just like sweep it under the rug and then say oh well we're not gonna think about it at all so that's fine that's like if you're that's I think that that's good to do that seems good to me I don't know yeah no I'm I'm on that team I'm on that team because you don't want you don't want to just like hot you don't want to say nothing because you're worried you're going to be perceived as a jerk or something like that you got to be able to say things and but my my always big worry is that because this is what happened last time I said rust Foundation is being absurd with these things I mean the amount of private messages the amount of servers I've appeared on and all that I you know I have a course called rust for typescript devs right like the moment this stuff has passed I genuinely feel like front end Masters will receive a uh cease and desist letter like we will have to rename it uh just because they they personally don't like me and so that makes it into this really difficult position which is to what extent should I say something if I have some sort of financial incentive not to which is it's just a weird place to be you know I don't like it especially just like it just feels like why some of the other thing is it just feels like self-inflicted wounds where from the outside at least it's very confusing why they even uh care that people put the rust name yeah on something I I don't know yeah so me and me and me and this Steve of person we actually have a lot in common so we should probably start the the official rust drama moment now that we kind of got through that um I don't know I I might actually turn that into a YouTube video just because I think it's kind of good to talk about the motivations to why I talk about this because people I mean like I've had I'm not gonna name any names but we've had some people fairly high up in the rust Community called me out multiple times for being uh a leech at all this often which I'm just like financially incentivized to be like hey this is really bad we should be careful here yeah all right there we go give me back my drama okay now let's do the whole rust drama business okay okie dokie do you have Steve's tweet I do I think that's that's basically okay good that's basically my take is exactly whatever Steve says yeah that's your take you just like to sing right I don't have whatever Steve says about it every time Steve has said anything about something with Russ I'm like yeah that seems like pretty good so all right so let's look at this uh it's called he obviously tweets this one the path to hell is paved with good intentions uh pretty great quote we'll look at that in just one second let's see what he has to say first uh what an absolute mess great follow-up the original design of crates IO and its policies was created by folks using their experience managing this stuff for years this literally reintroduces the literal circumstances that caused left pad to happen all right so just as like some some context it's there's some interesting things about crates like that you can't delete my understanding is you can't delete a crate basically like a particular version that's been released which is good like that's good you've published it some other project depends on it yesterday it builds tomorrow it's going to build that's like a win right there are some ways that you can I think it's called like yanking it where you can prevent new crates from depending on your crate right so you can basically say like I'm not doing this anymore stop depending on my crate but like if you have an existing project it's allowed to something along those lines I'm not once again I'm not a crates expert crazy Iowa expert So and I've never managed to package distributions but those things seem really good right where basically you can not have the scenario where someone gets angry and like deletes their thing and like half of you half of the web goes down like maybe that's not awesome yeah I like the idea of yank sense that I know that I'm sure there's great security things that are a positive I'm sure there's great reasons why you'd want yake uh the thing I don't like about is that if I'm developing something for a long time and at some point within that long duration someone says no new projects I'm effectively shut out of a distribution system for my said library that I've been using for a while no your library would still work well your library still depends on it would work but I couldn't distribute it via crates IO right because you're still good no no new ones could be used with yoink right or yank or whatever it's called so I think it's because your crate already depends on it it would still continue to work but I'm actually not 100 sure okay I thought you said any new ones wouldn't work that way so if I created a new library I created a library it's been around for two years I finally decide it's time to publish it to crates IO during that two years oh I see something gets yanked I all sudden can't distribute the thing I need to distribute you know I don't like those kind of signs but whatever I I get the idea um I mean yeah go ahead yeah that's good uh let's see this policy turns crate IO from a rock solid resource you can rely on into something that's essentially at the whims of the crates IO team guess how I feel about that as someone who's blocked by a crates IO team member not great see like this is my precise reason why I'm worried about the rust Foundation stuff it's identical which is I am blocked by people on the in that rust Circle I've been actively accused of many horrible things by those people downright lies but nonetheless actively accused how do you think that makes me feel when someone who's running for the moderation team which gets a vote to take down my course has actively aggressed against me right kind of you know it feels hard right I mean I agree with you Steve this even let's see this isn't even a policy yet and the folks involved are already laser focused on trying to take crates away from prominent community members all right so I think it's probably time to start jumping into this crates i o policy update yeah and looking at what it says it would be good maybe too if we could read the current policy as well my understanding is the current policy is that the only way to get a crate taken down is basically by court order what like literally you they I I don't actually know that's what I thought I I had been reading I read like a little bit of it which like any country a court that rust Foundation like operates in basically so like it's just saying like it's basically that you can't just someone on crates IO is not the person that gets to decide you have to basically get like uh like a court order from somebody okay I think I understand this better now because I know during um all this Fiasco and over the course yeah okay so there was a bunch of really inappropriately named crates is that probably part of this motivation they had some like strong racial slurs and things like that in there so if you prevent anyone from removing stuff you can imagine you get into this world where stuff like that exists yeah I I thought maybe some of that was I guess they also have a code of conduct that I think was like a lot more limited than maybe some of the things so I don't actually so that's what I'm saying I don't remember exactly what it is it would be good for us to maybe check out what the current policy is to do a comparison before we look at the the new one all right let's see if I can pull up the old uh I don't have a link yeah well I'm doing this whole uh this old uh GitHub thing I assume this will be the policy next to each other right uh no I think it's a propos there I think you can just go crazy policies and I think it just we can just read through a bunch of that pretty I I don't know that there's anything else besides that um social code of contact privacy policy package policies probably this one yeah package policies is pretty short it's pretty short all right yeah in general these policies are guidelines problems uh are often contextual and exceptional circumstances sometimes require exceptional measures we plan to continue to clarify and expand these rules over time as new circumstances arise if your problem is not described below consider sending us an email okay awesome package ownership uh we have a first come first serve policy on crate names perfect upon publishing a package the publisher will be made uh owner of the package on crates IL if someone wants to take over a package the previous owner agrees the existing maintainer can add them as an owner and the new maintainer can remove them if necessary the team may reach out to inactive maintainers and help mediate the process of ownership transfer perfect okay using an automated tool to claim ownership of a large number of packages is not permitted we reserve the right to block traffic or revoke ownership of any package we determine that have been claimed by an automated tool perfect removable makes sense many questions are specialized to instances of more general form under what circumstances can a package be removed from crates IO the short version is that packages are first come first serve and we won't attempt to get into policing what exactly makes a legitimate package we'll do what the law requires us to do and address flagrant violations of the rust code of conduct okay yeah so I think that's basically the one that's basically yeah the law meaning like a court says You must take this down right yeah or like you were there's a flagrant violation of Russ code of conduct also seems fair yeah it seems fair uh but this is I think where people get into the whole like rust changes rules or you know what constitutes flagrant blah blah I hope I just assumed probably ran by fairly you know normal people this will be easy to just go fine with uh how can I delete a crate I own from the registry you cannot delete creates from the registry but you can leave it open for transferring ownership to others if you do this you must publish a new version with a with a message in the readme communicating to crates IO support team that you consent to transfer the crate to the first person who asked for it I can send this this this this okay nice so squatting we do not have any policies uh to Define squatting and so you'll not let's say so we'll not hand over ownership of a package for that reason perfect the law for issues such as dmca violations trademark and copyright infringements create i o respect the rust foundation's legal decision with regards to content that is hosted so I think this is where the uh like if you have a package that's been around for a long time called rust Dash regex you are now potentially going to get taken down by the the foundation I know this was one of the concerns in the original stuff yes my understanding is that is one of the concerns because basically they wanted to have effectively like a name space that what they want is basically like the namespace you have in like typescript land right where you can do like you know app my company name slash this and basically they're gonna but they don't have namespaces so they just want everything with rust in the name to mean official packages of like the rust language right so I think that that's basically where people were feeling somewhat concerned yeah yeah I get it I you know it kind of seems funny not why not just add some sort of name spacing why is that not just a solution right there but anyways let's we can keep on going I'm sure there's technical limitations and you know getting someone to do it blah blah blah blah the rest project has a code of contact which a code of conduct which governs appropriate conduct for the rust community in general any conda any content on crates IO that violates the code of conduct may be removed here content can refer to this but not limited okay so the package name so this is where those inappropriately packaged named items probably just got removed and they didn't need any sort of update it just was easy to do right uh documentation code uh I wonder how code works I guess you could name something appropriate in the code so therefore they can take it down too okay I think also like if something was like built to do something illegal I think uh possibly that could get removed from crates I don't actually know how that works or not okay there are two important related aspects we will not uh be proactively monitoring the site for these kind of violations uh we will rely on the community to draw them to our attention perfect uh does uh does this violate the code of conduct is a contextual question that cannot be answered directly or directly answered there's my there's that dyslexia coming in in the hypothetical sense all of the details must be taken into consideration in these kinds of situations okay that makes sense yeah which is fair I mean like basically I don't know how you you can't possibly list every combination of something that someone's gonna do regardless of whether you you know like the foundation or not or whatever that's just it's not like oh Rose Foundation wants to keep it vague I think it's just like it's literally not possible yeah well what is today may not be fine just imagine all the phrases that have been openly said by everybody in the 90s or the 2000s that would now be considered fairly harsh thus one can imagine why you have to have a per you know per package name review in your current circumstance or something happens you know like you would not make you would say things differently like after 9 11 verse before 9 11. right you know like because something like literally happened and people died so you like wouldn't make you know it's like yeah that makes sense yeah things change you can't list out every single thing ever exactly okay car cargo and crates IO are projects that are governed by the blah blah I don't think this is it is crawlers before resorting to crawlers crates IO please access uh please that's just how you get the data okay perfect look they even use a little cargo crate request request okay so that's the that's the policy today and this is the policy change as of today it's not it's not a fish it's a proposal it's a proposal yes let's see where's that where's it where's the I want to view this thing Raw give me the oh is there a rich stiff what's a rich diff oh I I clicked it well there's no diff because it's just a proposal so like there's no there's no diff because it's just a proposal basically like what is the new one yeah there we go I okay so this is the new one okay cool let's see uh the rust Community has outgrown uh its current crates i o policies okay so we just got done reading them I'm curious how they outgrew them uh this RFC that was a question also on the issue tracker that I didn't I haven't seen a great answer to but maybe there is one yeah okay weird anyways this RFC proposes uh a new terms of use policy based on prior work uh by Pi Pi npm and GitHub interesting terms of use okay why are we doing this what cases does it support what is the expected outcome crates IO has a package policies page which describes the current organically grown policies a lot of supporters request for questionable uses of crates IO however need explicit decisions from the creates IO team since many cases are not covered by these policies which cases are covered by those policies by the way I guess we'll see below which ones I think additionally decisions made by the team may have been seen as arbitrary without written guidelines okay I do like always addressing that I think that is always good no matter how you feel about anybody having as defined guidelines as possible never a bad thing the situation around name squatting has lately also reached unsustainable levels and while namespaces might help with some parts of the problem we would still need policies for name squatting name spaces then well what if you had name squatting namespace of name spaces are namespaces boom but then there's like one more namespace how many namespace do you think we need before it just becomes that we don't actually have to worry about it how many namespaces deep do we need to go all the way uh we need oh camera to solve this because this ain't important uh let's see the main motivation for this RFC is to give crates IO team a fixed set of rules to determine if a project is using crates in a reasonable way or if the user should get a warning and the project potentially be removed so isn't that kind of interesting because we don't want to remove anything right couldn't that cause potential package breakage and all that interesting uh but for name squatting it would be that there's nothing there so like no one depends on the package right it's just like literally it just is sitting there and someone was like haha I got Tokyo Dash super cool you know or something like that right and they're not doing anything with it that's true but this one didn't say that this one's just like here's ways that they can do that uh it is most is mostly codifying the existing practices of the team except for being more strict regarding name squatting okay uh the proposal the following is a proposed new terms of use policy for creates IO okay terms of use short version crates IO is a critical resource for the rust ecosystem which hosts a variety of packages from a diverse group of users that resource is only effective when our users are able to work together as a part of a community in good faith while using creates IO you must comply with our acceptable use policies which includes some restrictions on content and conduct on crates IO related to user safety intellectual property privacy authentic authenticity and other limitations in short be excellent to each other I'm curious oh What can you I mean I I have questions on all these maybe hopefully let's just see if they address these things okay yeah okay sorry I want to talk about it but at the same time I understand we gotta we gotta go further yeah let's we'll re I think after this terms of use we'll be able to do that and then maybe there's a few like particular parts to pull out from like Steve's tweet as well where he has I think some additional Insight yeah I content or activity on crates IO that with code of conduct of the rust project is unlawful or promotes unlawful activities incurring uh legal liability income let's see in the country's Rush Foundation Foundation officially operates in okay good uh is liable liables uh defamatory or fraudulent amounts to phishing or I like how you say libelous liableless you just gotta keep saying until it comes out correctly anyways whatever infringes any proprietary right of any party including parent or Patent Trademark trade secret copyright right of publicity or other right okay so that means you can't name your package Microsoft yeah that makes sense okay fair enough uh unlawfully shares unauthorized product license Keys okay yeah perfect okay contains malicious code such as computer viruses computer worms root kits back doors or spyware including content submitted for research proposals tools designed and documented explicitly to assist security researchers are acceptable but exploits and malware that uses crates i o registry as a development or delivery Vector are not that's such like a funny line to be on because I mean any tool designed as a researcher can also in some sense be you know it's a it's a funny thing all right use it I get what they're saying though I mean they don't want to be a host for malware seems good yeah I mean the trust is obviously known for its safety so that would be probably pretty negative at this point it's the safest malware you've ever seen it will never power is never getting hacked got him it uses obfuscation to hide or mask functionality that is like a super bizarre one to me can we I know we're not supposed to pit stop but can we Pit Stop on this one we can Pit Stop on it what does it mean to obfuscate for some people riding rust obfuscates what you're trying to do I find any sufficiently complex package and it can feel like magic when you're looking at it yeah you know I don't know there's something about that that this just feels like a really odd maybe more definition I think minification or some sort of like something that runs through and changes the text right I think it's like you know it secretly hides that it's gonna Bitcoin mine or something like that right so I think I think that that one is also reasonable right because you're going to say that you're one thing but you're actually another I think they would want to try and prevent that from being on crates sure right these are all the like best faith interpretations of it right so I think that that that's why why you would say that okay uh is discriminary discriminatory toward harasses or abuses another individual group okay uh we're by the way if you spend your time uploading create crates to create i o to harass people that's just like a strange use of your time you know you you got to get off 4chan and go touch the grass that's a you that's a you problem like a solid you problem yeah yes threatens or entices violence toward any individual or group especially on the basis of who they are that's an interesting one because again it kind of falls under this one I'm not sure how it's much different than this one um wouldn't that be illegal I think it would actually I think it would actually be just simply pretty sure if it's uh inciting or threatening violence that's illegal yeah yeah I believe assault is uh when you even when you threaten violence that's is like that's like by the law U.S assault yeah um all right is using crates IO as a platform for propagating abuse on other platforms so no on npm okay don't you do it yeah uh let's see uh violates the privacy of uh any third party such as posting another's personal information okay beautiful um or glorifies violence including violent images ooh interesting I mean I'm totally on that team but I'm trying to think is there someone must have done that seems like someone did it you know what I mean someone like uploaded I don't know like a bunch of screenshots of something and was like lol crazy oh like and then yeah makes sense exactly that's how I'm like how did that how do you arrive to this conclusion almost behind every single rule usually exists yeah someone that did something wrong so that seems just crazy uh is sexually obscene or relates to sexual exploit exploitation or abuse including of minors well I'm I don't even think you need yeah this already said that right not the same thing when I read this first they're like did they they really need to collude including of miners yes duh but you already have it right here sexual exploitation or abuse on here I know that one I thought the same thing when I read that I was like um it seems like that would be with without saying because yeah of course that's not okay that's never okay yeah and it's contained in here all right is false inaccurate or intentionally deceptive information and likely to adverse or adversely affect the public interest including health safety election Integrity or civil participation I didn't read this one I'm not sure how that one works like what could you I'm confused by that one in the sense that like if you okay let's just say uh Alex Jones making the the frogs gay like if you upload that which you could argue is false information I'm gonna argue it's true though one could argue it's true but nonetheless it's like how do you how how first off how do you even find out this stuff like because who's using this crate like when did crates IO become a exchange for information yeah I it does seem kind of weird because like also who my understanding is that then this would be up to the crates IO team to have to enforce this which seems like a really crappy situation for them like I wouldn't want to have to be doing that you know what I mean like you're gonna get at the ire of some level because you could like like imagine if a if someone you don't like yeah uploads a election Integrity counter right are they being like what happened if the crates IO team doesn't like them and therefore they're like therefore you can't have this up right like I can see all these weird rules you get into where it's like what is the actual intent yeah what if there's um something about say like a publicly traded company that has a large you know vested interest in uh you know in Rust right and then now they're in a this situation where they have to basically decide whether they're going to listen to Pfizer about something you know I don't know if Pfizer probably does not but like you Pfizer's been sued for a lot of money for various things whatever I'm not saying that like not saying just like you you really want to be in that situation that seems sucky you know like to have to be the one that manages that yeah and then you're just some guy on the crates iot and they're like oh what am I doing today hmm oh I'm getting I'm getting a vaccine expert I guess I'll be a vaccine expert let me see you you could just ask Twitter oh maybe it's about semiconductors maybe if you published a semiconductor one uh now everyone's an expert on that too according to x.com yeah dude that's that's actually really funny that's where these things get really confusing uh is off topic or interacts with the platform features in a way that significantly or repetitive repetitively repetitively uh repeatedly repeatedly disrupts the experience I got it I got this um okay I don't get the off topic one so the one that I heard for this one is someone was posting a Blog on crates where they released a new version every time they like pushed a new thing and then you would like it basically published a docs.rs so like you rendered your blog as like a site about rust and then when you pushed a new version docs RS would update and you could use like the inner links and everything so it was like a way to do a static blog site with a hosting and everything I mean first off that's incredible I don't see why anyone would be upset with that that's actually a brilliant use of things but I think they don't want it there I guess so like I think that's so my understanding the the connection that I've heard from that one is basically that that's that's how that got pulled out yeah okay exists only to reserve a name for a prolonged period of time often called name squatting without any genuine functionality purpose or significant development activity on the corresponding repository okay reasonable so that's one of the ones though that people are taking we will see one of the the link that like Steve gave for example about why this is really difficult so we'll come back to it yeah nobody actually yeah let me let me re let me re go back from interesting to or reasonable to this uh I haven't touched Harpoon in a long long time at what point does it become squatting yeah I think they're changed there's nothing in there but yeah it also says significant development activity I don't know if that means beforehand or like ongoing yeah because weapon if I like the thing I've created and I believe it does not deserve any more changes what do you do then yeah or or you just plan on doing it at some point and you thought of a sweet name so you'd like to keep the name I don't know I get that yeah as someone who has a Perpetual graveyard of projects I totally get that is related you're the reason they should be able to remove crates come on start start 80 projects you're just taking up the whole namespace they would just give me namespaces I'd have the primer again okay at the primogen and it could just be half it can just be half uh done or not you know I know it doesn't matter let's see is related to buying selling or otherwise trading of package names or any other names on crate i o for money or any any other compensation okay yeah it is the new crypto dude there is only one prime stack uh but I actually am completely on top I never want to see money because that's where the squatting would get really bad yes that one seems good yep you just get Perma band get out impersonates any person or entity including uh through false associations with crate IO by fraudulently misrepresenting your identity or your site's purpose okay is related to inauthentic interactions such as fake accounts or automated in inauthentic activity okay uh is using our servers for any any form of excessive automated bulk activity to place undue burden on our servers through automated means or to relay or rely any form of unsolicited advertising or solicitation and through our servers such as get rich quick schemes classic my uncle in Nigeria just died just nigerianprints.rs I guess I don't know fine you know what I mean like like it seems good that they're basically saying like no you can't push 10 billion releases every day and like expect us to build your crate that has you know uh just a huge dependency tree and you basically like take down crates by doing this yeah you should get banned seems good I actually published like seven versions in a day and it said I couldn't publish anymore for 24 hours I'm actually I I think that's probably pretty fine uh yeah is other automated excessive let's see let's see is other automated excessive bulk activity and coordinated inauthentic activities such as spamming cryptocurrency money I could see like a build RS file containing a crypto Miner and then you're just uploading a bunch of versions to crates IO thus you now officially are mining crypto on crates IO money yes yep it's definitely something you want to prevent seems good it seems genius uh it's not functionally uh compatible with cargo build tool for example a package cannot simply be a ping or a JPEG image a movie file or a text document uploaded directly to the registry okay weapon if I want to use it like uh Google Drive what's the big deal is abusing the package that's what they're saying they want to prevent people from using it as Google drive it is what happen if I want to though I have my own Google Drive I want to do is abusing the package index a four purposes not intended they're saying you can't have a crate that is literally just movies I know what I'm saying I want that okay why can't I just have my movies crate okay I want my Google Drive percent so I can see my different versions of it TJ yeah I'm agreeing with that sounds good all right uh hold on we do have to take a quick break I'm gonna pee my pants I gotta go I've drank too much I'll be right back again DJ shut up you are responsible for using crates IO in compliance with all applicable laws regulations and all of our policies these policies may be updated from time to time we'll interpret our policies and resolve disputes in favor of protecting users as a whole the crates i o team reserves the possibility to evaluate each instance on a case-by-case basis for such issues as DM dmca violations okay we've already read all this uh is there anything else that is important because like data access that looks the same uh package ownership pretty much looks the same yeah it is pretty much the exact same I really think that this is the added part right yeah I think primarily it's about it's about that section the terms of use because the rest looks pretty much uh pretty much the same okay yeah I guess there's this one unresolved questions uh is the wording of the name reservations Clause sufficient to discourage name squatting in the future are there any current legitimate use cases of crate i o that would suddenly be forbidden by these new rules um future possibilities pep uh five four one also defines rules for abandoned projects and how people could continue maintenance for them introducing something like that would be a large deviation for crates IO though and something that would need a dedicated RFC nevertheless uh it is worth thinking about if the majority of the rust Community would prefer having such a rule set okay yeah all right so now with this new understanding let's go back is there is there any further tweets that are going on here so I would read the directly linked comment here by Steve okay this one oh you can you can look at my really funny meme too you should use it as the thumbnail don't you think it's just two I give you full permission TM TM are you sure yeah will you put it on like one half and you're like looking at it and reading a book like in a library you know what I mean all right where is this where can you can you link me the uh the link I did it not I think it's it's that one it's that one right there where which one the the comment that you were just on this one this guy uh this guy or this big one a big one the one wrote the one right before it okay okay yeah yeah okay can you elaborate on a bit on why you think your reservations are fair to the rest of the rust Community oh hold on I kind of wanna all right so we can go back up yeah Carol Carol's tencent says that okay hold on let's let's uh let's just grab this text right here okay so I want I kind of want to follow this little trade there we go so this should be um all right when I reserve a crate name it's because either I have an idea for a new a crate run cargo new pick a name since I have to and Reserve that name because I don't want to have to deal with renaming anything later of course 90 of these ideas never get to the point of shipping B I am working in a space uh EG Tokyo slash async and I'm carving out a space for async dash there was all there was Slash is a plan to release smaller crates but for the most part that have been downed uh down prioritized at the time there was a race with other crate i o users to reserve as many async Dash great names as possible so I was mostly just embracing the incentive structure of a single flat namespace okay that's actually super reasonable again this is why namespaces are just incredible to have that's it and why like saying that something is just name squatting is not really like Fair as in like you may want to you may have real reasons for reserving a name with this situation because you plan on doing something with Tokyo and like you want to have one official crate for it and have it be the right name because it's like not like people can't put Tokyo in the name of their crates if it uses Tokyo you know what I'm saying like they maybe should that lets people know but it's kind of lame that there's no way to sort of differentiate that this is like an official Tokyo package versus not yeah I could literally upload Tokyo Dash I stream on Twitch Dash thtv right like right now and I could just do that uh that said I believe current behavior is just what will happen with a single flat namespace I doubt any additional rules will stop me from reserving crate names if it is a question of putting up a repo read me in some code then that is what I will do like I said for every name I reserve I first generate the repo unless you are setting up some sort of broad uh some sort of board to determine if the first day of Dev on a new project is genuine functionality so if it just seems like it'd be easier uh to either just let things be or add some sort of name spacing I'm at I'm at a completely on board with exactly what's being said here which is that and then the spacing solves a huge number of the at least the squatting things then there is some additional drama actually with this content that I saw which is that that chat GPT down below is like an example of how you can just ask chat GPT to generate a bunch of stuff for a like uh project to make it look like a somewhat reasonable project and they uh edited that like the moderators of this edited this comment is my understanding like if you check the edit history notice that it's edited by someone else that's not Carl leyche wait right over us on the Fly oh wow yeah did it did all that hold on whoa whoa whoa whoa oh I just jumped out sorry okay so where do you what do you mean the edit the edited so like check the edit history oh my Turbo why why was it being edited edit because they didn't like that there was a post from chat showing how to basically get around this idea it's my I don't know I can't say any particular I don't know why they did which is my understanding that they actually did change that change the edits which is kind of weird when did when did uh when did GitHub allow people like not the person making a post allow for editing I think it's been around for a while you can you can like literally click on the drop down and you can see cannot so that means if I own this this PR and someone makes a comment I can just edit I'm not that drop down the little down arrow the upside down Versa icon oh gosh I don't even see it can you can you oh this right here next to edited by Turbo stop sign on for cell one oh really okay so I can actually see this one on see just a demo that would take minimal effort to generate these stubs yeah oh wow you're right just straight up takes that out oh then puts it back up then puts it back yeah so and then so there is in like Steve was not if there were some people replying in the comments from in that original Thread about that which is kind of weird okay yeah I I have allows you to do that it just seems really um I don't like that right it's like just that feature in general seems really bizarre okay I mean it makes sense to be able to like if people I I don't know it's whatever I don't super care the be able to delete a comment right if someone says something whatever you can just delete it but just to like change what they said yeah I'm just going to uh he looks good to me separate separate drama you can cover it in a different video separate separate Turbo [Music] uh Carl as I've written above I think it's uh reasonable to reserve a couple names for a project that are actively being worked on to give the others some uh hear some context Carl currently has 288 crates whoa doxing here and 180 of them have a description explaining that these are reserved names most these crates are four to six years old at this point with no apparent development activity regarding name spacing as I've written in the RFC text this is an orthogonal topic uh and there's an open RFC that I personally support implementing you are very welcome to participate I don't think this is an orthogonal Topic at all I do think that this would cure most of the previous stuff right because the main I think concern by some people is primarily about um a change to giving my understanding is like that people are concerned that now crates IO team has unreasonable in their view power to be able to remove crates when they like right and then like but a lot of people want to reserve those because they are actively working on other things like Carlos one of the guys who works on Tokyo it's not like a random it's just like a random person reserving 300 crates you know what I'm saying like and you can imagine a situation that arises where say one of these four to six-year-old crates clearly not being worked on obviously kind of been squatted on if you will uh let's just say friend of crates IO person says hey I really want async runtime async dash run time I'm building something can you can you do something about this and then they can go ah look at this it's not being used you're done here you go okay go right you could imagine that you definitely create weird incentive structures right and so basically you know my understanding is Carl's thing is he's saying it's not orthogonal because then I wouldn't care you guys can go and do whatever you want uh and then I would have to do it okay yeah actually let's see that let's see what they say um let's jump over to here okay so this is where carols comes in uh part of the motivation for this let's see I okay I'd like to understand your reasoning a bit more here okay well let me read the quote just to make sure we're on on this like I said I believe the current behavior is just what is happening with the single flat namespace I doubt any additional rules yep okay we are we remember this part I'd like to understand you're reasoning a bit more here part of the motivation for this RFC is the number of complaints that the crate crates i o team hears from the community members want to create they want has been claimed years ago and contains no useful functionality these users see this as a kind of reservation as an unfair exploitation of the Community Resources of a flat namespace can you elaborate a bit more on or can you elaborate a bit on why you think your reservations are fair to the rest of the rust Community okay it feels a little a little aggressive there but um like when I hear this it seems like they're saying the solution out loud repetitively yeah like they're even right because there's a single flat namespace the truest problem is right here yeah and they're just like saying it out loud like yeah since it is a flat namespace why are you saying what your reservations are fair to the rest right yeah that part that part has been the confused like so like I said I'm not a crates IO expert this has been the confusing part for me as it seems like um maybe like Implement namespaces and then come back to see how much of this RFC needs to happen because it's really hard to put things like back in a box once yeah they've they've been like let out yeah where is where is there's already an RFC pushing towards non-flat namespaces so let's just see how that shakes out and see what people have to say afterwards right because I I didn't I haven't seen anything yet of people saying wear crates has outgrown the current package policy right like I get that it was said but I was I don't personally understand like where is that coming from you know what I'm saying like I don't super get that yeah can you elaborate a bit more on what you think uh your reservation let's see on can you elaborate a bit on why you think your reservations are fair to the rest of the rust Community again I really think that that's like a crappy phrase to just say in general you know can you please like your behavior is good for everybody else tough guy or like is it is it fair that Carl works on Tokyo it's not fair what yeah that's not fair he works on Tokyo he's the one who's getting the loser side of the deal everyone else just gets Tokyo for free I get a dude Tokyo cold cold in Maine he's sweat Blood and Tears making it possible yeah I in I had one line of code magically async which I can't write so do you put it is not a question of fairness correct uh the current crates IO mechanics is a classic prisoner's dilemma it actually truly is I mean same with npm though either everyone plays fair and everyone has the best experience some play fair While others go off in name squat or those playing Fair get the shaft and everyone name squats and gets a mediocre outcome well there's actually a fourth one which is everyone plays fair and people still have shitty experiences because you have to if I want to make something called Tokyo and Carl already made Tokyo I cannot make Tokyo like that's just that's playing fair and even that's just the way it goes right like you just happened to come across you thought of the idea some other idea all by yourself without knowing Tokyo existed and you go to register it and then it doesn't work yeah personally when someone emails me and asks for me to transfer ownership of a reserved a crate name if I have no immediate plans to use it I say yes EG I transferred Fury earlier this week my argument is a dope name for a crate it is I would have been sad to let it go it sounds like what do you think like a good testing framework what do you think Theory I don't know but no matter what you can just say like it's crazy fast or something I don't know you just like it's [Laughter] solution is to change the mechanics to incentivize the behaviors we want to achieve exactly uh the crates IO team already has more than enough work to do adding additional policy enforcement work does not seem productive Carl currently has 288 crates and 180 of them have descriptions explaining that these crates are uh Reserve names again look at the just doxing his PR prolific experiences out here okay how about we break that down a bit since you seem keen on making an example of me remember they're making an example of probably one of the most helpful crates in all of rust like everybody is confusing everybody uses it uh I audited uh all the crates in my account out of the 288 I found 44 crates uh that are reserved new names accumulated over six years out of all the others they are either released crates or reserved crates within the active namespace including Tokyo tonic Trace tracing HTTP hyper warp Futures Mio async warp first off I recognize pretty much every last one of those things this is like the most prolific community of all time yeah oh hey all the crates I use yeah I know all of those because I've used them all like really like Carl is like holding up the rust community single-handedly and he's getting called the dude in the xkcd comic like you know it's like Carl is the one little block you know yeah poor guy they're trying to pull the one block yeah so I will discount those since your stance is it is okay to reserve names within an active namespace got him uh out of the remaining crates here's a list assertive code is here automation code is here buffer slash Buffs reserved for work in the bytes name family Cash Pad never published but the code uh lives in Crosby mutils and copied into Tokyo codec intended for the idea of Tokyo codex which currently lives in Tokyo util and was down prioritized core IO stood more stood uh stood Nets net X I revisit the idea of having a crate that uh batch utility slash code that I tend to write slash depend on a lot a kitchen sink standard I have code uh for this kitchen sink sdd Prime oh it's a kitchen setting STD classic one stay away from that kitchen sink that's one of those crates haven't been published Theory a web framework that prioritizes maximum perf over good ergonomics ooh I have a sketch in my GitHub private but since decided that it was a bad idea and I handed this a crate earlier this week Jen another name for Cogen which actually is shipped Godzilla slash Zilla I don't actually remember what this was for all right introspect reserving uh for extracting uh tracing core record apis this ended up being valuable uh I assume is that the name uh I think so I think that's a different crate yeah okay janitor Seb Sebastian ship it wizard over the years I keep revisiting the idea of better automation for releasing batches of crates instead I end up collapsing Tokyo into a single crate I have private code in my GitHub for this Kabuki a light actor framework built on Tokyo I have code in a private repo machines and ALT name for automation mini format a lighter version of rust format for generated or code but uh D tone did it better there you go this one right here uh Mute cell slash Mute cell a cell wrapper that enables pushing into a vector with self pair I don't remember what this was for a pole weeple extracting the windows poll impul uh from Neo okay nice reconnect a library to wrap a socket to automatically reconnect beautiful oh yeah that's great stuff uh I I would love it if the billion dollar company slack could just have their sockets reconnect maybe they could consider reconnect shed they're probably prevented too because he has the crate name that's the only thing that's been stopping them it's just If Only They had a namespace uh shed extract Tokyo's multi-threaded scheduler to a more generic thread pool never did it response this wasn't intended to work with HTTP namespace Solair a mini in process database uh come on just let me call it Solaire I have some code but never got it working send selectors smile end of the video as you're reading there's not even that much drama but I do like hearing you have to read this many words in one video uh used to my kids oh you have you know it exists I literally have fortunately they don't know what they can't read so they don't know what the actual words are acsn we're still very confused why about the book of or The Wheel of Time the amount of things I've made up is just ridiculous a CSS like selector API to select Sid nodes thread Park extract Tokyo's thread parking logic never done toasty actively in progress okay so in other words blah blah there's a whole bunch of stuff uh you're gonna read 40. I couldn't finish the job I'm just gonna do the last one a web app uh ended up calling it Tower web for now but I had thoughts to rename Tower web to web app if it became successful Weirs wires uh don't remember this you may ask why don't I default to working in public because when I do I get curious users trying to use the code contribute submit bugs way before I'm ready for it exactly I mean I might abandon the project I also have experienced others trying to beat me to the punch and release an alternative before I finish what I'm working on oh yeah that makes perfect sense you already have it named you have a cool name you already do all this and boom people are just jumping in trying to beat you to the punch for it ah awesome as far as I know crates IO does not have a mechanism that I can use to quickly release a crate if there was I would probably release a bunch of these I also probably would release all the future crates because I don't work let's see because I don't work I that namespace anymore I think he's saying like get rid of the he doesn't need a bunch of these crates related to Futures Dash because the plan is no longer to split it into a bunch of crates okay pretty much all of this becomes moot with some sort of crate name spacing I am completely on board with all of this apparently I can't like or thumbs up those things but you're banned I'm banned um what do you think about all this is this is there some is there discussion that we're missing about this um so there's let me see if I can find the other one you you might want to say something something just happened in chat I don't know yeah no something did happen in chat uh it's with the beautiful voice man you know like I probably wouldn't say anything fun hello my name is uh the primogene now you're probably wondering how did I get this beautiful maleficial and voice well actually I uh went through a second puberty is what the doctor says and it turns out that when you turn old like I you actually get a beautiful voice it's one of the benefits now uh I'm still waiting on my second puberty because this is actually how I sound I sound kind of a little higher than normal but I I have a voice real voice reveal real voice reveal right here but I I just I just tune it down so I feel better about myself you know what I mean by the way Thor thank you very much for the uh if for those that don't know uh Thor's dad uh Legend Thor Legend Odin yeah you didn't know that I didn't know it was his his dad was owed and that's pretty cool yeah he's literally a legend he is literally a legend you should know this by yeah uh appreciate of going over some Rust drama um unfortunately uh things have happened we're gonna keep on going but it just appears from what I can tell oh you linked some good stuff yeah I linked on him okay this one is one of the ones where like there's secondary drama that uh it just feels like every time something happens I think inspire a lot of control I can't read it because oh nice even better I mean I'll dream about I'll switch to you can see it from me then um here you go okay everyone's laughing at me like I said why do you think I worry a little bit about here area you can just read it from my video okay hold on I I'm I'm good that's so funny dude can you make it really big yeah yeah okay bigger so I'll I'll read it since it's on my screen yeah yeah yeah make it I can't read it anyways because I think discord's making it about 12 pixels yeah okay so uh zoom in okay yeah concept behind see I'm doing oh sorry here you go thank you thank you the concept behind crate IO squatting RFC may or may not be group a little bit but doing things like this strongly suggests that the actual implementation which is more important is untrustworthy anyone who feels free to edit someone else's words for example in a discussion of a feature is something I expect will abuse the power they have in other ways which is about for about four hours one of his comments was redacted by the RFC author they cited actively encouraging creating spam projects but the text just mentioned it would be easy to bypass squatting rules and provide a chat GPT example um by the way this if we go down to uh profile is my Twitter in case anyone was wondering luckily no one can actually see this How To Lose Friends and disinterest people to Free Yourself of success the rust Foundation updated for the last generation of leaders foreign okay I'll go back to just being a video okay yeah just go back to being just a video I'm Gonna Make You small again hold on I need you to feel small why isn't the problem blocked by tgb how would I self-promote chat think about it yeah think about it hold on a few people I know Chad's never been reliable on things um I'll open this up just for everybody to see this so what I what I see here is like I totally agreed hey actually I was quicker I would have had you dang it I'm just blocked uh but I think that this is a a really good call out uh by whoever blocked me I didn't even read the name but which is like the person with whom is going to be given Authority is also the person redacting comments within a GitHub issue stating valid concerns and valid things I think there's a lot to be said right there which is who how can you possibly trust the system that's why the system needs to be a little bit more foolproof yeah and and or or the system needs to have like incentives that make it so there isn't conflict right so like namespacing is an example of a really solid way to completely prevent a lot of the conflict that people feel for things like reserved crates or great names like I'm totally down for them to be like yeah there's a bunch of stuff we don't want to host on crates and if you do this this this this you should just get tossed off crates or even I don't even care Perma band sounds good like I don't care you know what I mean like I'm not going to do anything stupid like try and host full-length copyrighted videos on crates yeah yeah just permabanum that sounds good but like if instead you instead the problem is like oh so-and-so reserved a bunch of crates and and they're like squatting on it or people are like making Microsoft adjacent named crates and they want Microsoft wants to like take those over or something well okay then just make it so that that can't happen and then there's no conflict at all and I don't even have to trust moderators because no one's ever going to be angry exactly and it'd be pretty easy like for me obviously they introduce namespaces I could reserve my name if I didn't get to reserve my name I think it'd be pretty easy to prove that I should get that namespace as I think a lot of people that do anything bigger like Tokyo guy if someone's jumped on Tokyo right it'd be pretty easy to be like I think I deserve Toki you should just give me Tokyo right and then it'd be it resolve most issues and even namespace squatting would be pretty easy to resolve with any bigger names because they'd be instantaneously understood that it's not the same right yeah I think the the thing people are like worried about is some of the like parts that are a little bit more vague right in that now like before it felt like the only way to get your crate removed was effectively like a court order or a blade like a blatantly flagrant against rust code of conduct which is like that's for me that's what I would rather see and like rust go to kind of it's not like it's just don't do anything illegal there's lots of stuff in Rust code of conduct to protect people you know what I mean like I'm sure rust code of conduct doesn't let people upload sexually explicit images of children like yes duh so like it's but that's listed so so it's it's sort of weird because you're like yeah you're listing things again where it's confusing yeah that should be those people should get reported to the government and they should go have very bad things happen to them not just kicked off crates IO yeah straight straight to jail yeah so so that's the part where I feel like there's some second like order things where people feel like well what the heck like uh that it just seems like you're adding a bunch of work to crates i o team to police things that like is better left either to literally like a court or um to the rust Foundation itself to basically say you you ask Russ Foundation does this violate the code of conduct and they say yes or no and if they say yes then they say get off crates and if they say no then they don't and the crates i o team doesn't have to moderate it right doesn't that not just seem like an easier situation for everybody yeah not only that but you could also anonymize um some of that information I mean that the Russ Foundation team could just look at it through an anonymous lens so you just include only the package name right you can just drop the name space so no pre you know no no bias judgment can happen in there or the code in question or the misnaming or the you know the obfuscation all those things could all be done in such a way that it makes people feel that it's a fair process yeah all right so I don't know I like I uh you know I really appreciate this thanks for calling this out uh it is so odd that somehow every single time rust somehow rust has some of the most drama out of any language I've been a part of I don't know maybe it's just because I I haven't really I guess been too deep into oh camel I mean typescript's drama is completely different typescript's drama was like my web framework is better than your web framework you yeah don't know a web framework but like the language the language drama doesn't happen because it's just like Microsoft just basically owns it right did that they still own it I don't even know so they just get to be like yeah it's Microsoft you're like okay well they're gonna do what they want that that does solve some things um yeah I don't know yeah all right well unfortunate that uh somehow namespaces aren't an obvious win here uh and the people still are questioning why namespaces are brought up it seems just like a strange strange Universe we live in not to say that as an immediate benefit right off the rip uh but hey I appreciate you coming on appreciate talking about the rust stuff uh I hope that next month can go by without a rush drama August is a great month to go touch grass um true if it's still alive you should definitely go touch it uh it's it's pretty much great in all areas of the earth so it's pretty easy some places actually August is winter time oh yeah Han there's like that whole southern hemisphere thing classic American only thinker I'm leaving I get me out of this stream that's it you better go host a conference right he didn't oh he did leave he left me that's my screen Hey look it's my oh TJ stop leaving me am I actually leaving or I would just get out of here I appreciate you though all right bye all right hey guess what you forgot Brazil you damn it Brazil I knew that I just the name is there's only the United States of America again
