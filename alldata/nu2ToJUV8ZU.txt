so in this video we're going to actually look get a real look at some real resumes that i use to apply to a few jobs we're going to look at the very first one that got me my very first software engineering job then we're going to look at the one that got me into microsoft as a full time and then we are going to look finally at the one that i currently have so welcome to tech and turn if you've never been on this channel before it's completely dedicated to helping you get your next internship so i highly recommend please subscribe below it helps me out quite a lot and smash that like button if you get some value out of this video i think the great thing about this video is that you're gonna learn from my mistakes my name is jason i'm a software engineer at microsoft and i did six internships across three countries during my time in school so i know the struggle of how of creating resumes especially from getting started and having nothing all the way to eventually having something that's a little bit more refined and that's what i want to show you in this video you could make all the same mistakes as i did and learn each time you make your own resume but if you had to do it six times like me you've been through the process you have all the iterations of it it makes so much more sense for you to just look at the mistakes i made make sure to not make them in your own resume so we're actually doing a resume critique giveaway right now where i will look at your resume and i will help you refine it for the job you're looking for so to be entered into that all you have to do is subscribe to the channel and you can go and find that resume critique giveaway video on the channel uh it should be the last video let's let's just dive in what i want to do is i'm going to put the resume up on the screen probably here that we're looking at and i'll just show you exactly the experience i had and tell you what i like about the resume what i don't like about the resume and we'll just compare all of them and see the progression over time so let's get going this was not my first resume this was my first the first resume that got me a technical job so um as you'll see i already have one internship on here under experience but that was just helping people fix their computers so this resume is the one that got me my very first programming job and i know that can be kind of hard to crack into the industry especially when you're looking for that first tech job so let's take a look at this resume so the very first thing i notice is that this resume has so much white space like look at the entire side there look at the whole panel where there's nothing used and you see how i put languages on the same line c and c plus plus on the same line python and java on the same line there's no reason that i couldn't just put them on their own lines to fill up a little bit of that white space but you know you live and learn the about i didn't put any contact information for myself so if someone got this resume they would be like great but i can't hire you you didn't even give me any of your contact info um so the jason goodison what i do like about this resume and a recruiter did mention it to me uh during an interview is there's a little bit of color in there that just kind of makes it pop you know something to set you apart from the other people there's a big banner with my name big banner with your name is is great if you don't have much experience you know space is not a scarce resource and as you'll see as we go on and you get more experience space gets more and more scarce and the reason for it is that you don't want um to do two pages you know the the industry standard is one page for every ten years so sometimes i see people coming out of high school with two page resumes that's a no no make sure not to do that here i was far away from that i wasn't even using the space i had so so i've got a qualification section excellent written and spoken communication skills fast learning ability these are all things that i try to outline in my resume now also but i put them under jobs so i'll say you know i demonstrated my fast learning ability in a specific job i will no longer just state that at the top of my resume with absolutely no evidence of it education of course relevant courses i don't know why i put english in there try to keep it to three is my go-to keep it to three um courses sometimes i see people listing all the courses they've taken related to computer science also that's a no no because it really takes away from the important stuff so they'll put like software engineering one software engineering two object-oriented programming one object-oriented programming two these are things that are not going to set you apart from anyone and they're pulling away from important things so maybe you do have one really cool uh interesting course you took something that you know is not an average course that people take like it's it's an elective maybe it was something like i don't know for example machine learning i don't know why you're doing that in first year but machine learning right if you just if you put just that it would pop out more to people than if you put five or six things it's very off the bat try to keep that two three uh three courses experience service desk specialist you can see how small the text is here like i could have easily bumped this up it's actually kind of hard for me to read i could have bumped up that eaten a bit more of that white space so remember try to keep that white space to a minimum received highest rating of any past co-op for this position that's actually true i got the highest rating of any of any past intern because um i i went above and beyond to create to create a python script that uh was not part of my job and it was a way to incorporate programming into my job and and that was the most impressive thing about my entire experience at that company and you can see here i didn't list it oh you know what i put it under projects okay all right well we'll get to it i guess demonstrated strong communication skills provided internal support to maple leaf to make believe employees that means nothing like if i was reading this as a recruiter i'd be like internal support what what the hell does that even mean uh front counter worker at tim hortons kingsville yeah i did that too um you know started off in a small rural town uh dreams of the big city and finally made it so uh performed well in a constantly stressful environment that's actually a really good thing to put on your resume i see a lot of people coming at the first year that have you know i had this one guy in particular and he had that he worked at a froyo place and he said something along the lines of uh took payments like literally in one in one sentence took payments comma served froyo and i think the reason that he didn't put that much effort into it is because he was a little bit embarrassed by it like oh this is a i'm trying to apply for a software engineering job and all i have is that i worked at a froyo place but all i had is that i worked at tim hortons but you have to use what you've got right so here front counter worker but i still talk about um stressful environment like it was a very fast-paced environment worked as part of a successful team like i'm gonna use that as a software engineer too there are still skills mostly soft skills not technical ones but there's still skills that you're gonna use at both of these two jobs right what's the other point i put there demonstrated strong interpersonal skills while dealing with customers fantastic those are all things that you can you know use on your resume too those are good points if i'd been a quick learner like that would be a good place to put fast learning ability also you could talk about how you got ramped up in a really short amount of time projects no reason why the projects is like a 12 point font and the experience and education sections are like 50 point font and have color in them there's no reason for it i don't know why i did that um 06 2015. yeah the date seems kind of strange too process automation script maple leaf foods this is the the scripts that kind of set me apart i'm going to have another video on this entirely about how you can incorporate what you want to learn into your job even if it's not a technical job so remember hit that subscribe button and if you're getting value from this video please hit that like button right now it helps me out a lot so wrote process automation script in python okay increased product productivity of is department this this is something i call out on people's resumes all the time now and it's funny to see that i used to make those mistakes too i didn't even realize that i put this down until i'm looking back at it why did i not put a number on that well i was worried that somebody would say well you have to prove that or you know how did you get that number but later on in further iterations of this resume i end up just saying like a number like 30 percent and the way i come up with that number is i just kind of guess like i say well you know on average it takes this long to do it this many people do it this many times a month therefore it took this long now it takes this long and i just did the math nobody's gonna audit this try to be right try to get it um you know as as correct as you can but nobody's gonna audit this so um outputted an excel file that reflected success of an update push took initiative to write okay another things here i also talked about in another resume video about the difference between the what the why and the impact you see a lot of the what here the what is basically just i wrote a python script and it outputs an excel file i put two points to just say that um i i put too much what the impact i didn't even quantify and the why isn't even here like why did i do this right that's not even clear through this but i do like that i said i took initiative to write it um i could be a little bit more poetic in in how i worded that but uh you know talking about taking initiative going above and beyond those are all good qualities monopoly game school project okay well this is something a lot of people are going to have on their resume right now it was one of the only programming things i have so sure put it on that's fine uh worked in a team of two to make monopoly game didn't say that i had these great team building skills or that i led the team those are all things that i should have put on there utilize multiple software design patterns which ones um i didn't even put that i used to get here which is the first time i'd ever used git before um created in c plus plus yeah see that's the what but whatever meme generator app can't hack enough all right so i went to a hackathon um with a few of my friends this was the only one that would let us in um wrote app in android studio designed attack plan randomized lines adjectives and pictures to create a new meme that is the what the what and the what i i said i did three points there on what the app is no points on why no points on impact hardly anything about what i learned really like all i said is wrote app and android studio looking at this resume it's actually really bad i thought it was much better i had this idea in my head that my first software engineering resume was actually pretty good but i just dug it out of my email now and that is not good um and not that there's not good content there like i could have made a good resume out of this content the fact that i had that automation script in python from my first uh internship and that i went above and beyond to write that that's gold and it's not it's not even shown here really like it's it's not even like i'm talking about it um and i think one of the reasons for that is it's difficult to brag when you come from certain cultures you know it it feels bad to brag you're told to not you're not allowed to do it when you're growing up and it feels like you're bragging when you're on a resume but that's what the resume is for so don't be afraid to brag about yourself on the resume please again if you got any value out of this please like this and subscribe to it we're
