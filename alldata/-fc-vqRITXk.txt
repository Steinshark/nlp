so let me tell you a quick story about San Francisco my friend who grew up in the Soviet Union lived during the fall of the Soviet Union lived in both uh vladist Russia and almati Kazakhstan uh from there he's been to KGAN all all the other stands he got robbed and his car stolen I forget in which of the stands he studied at Cambridge if I'm not mistaken he knows like six different languages and when he flew out to see me and California he was like you we got to go to San Francisco well he talks like this you got to go to San Francisco I hear it's incredible I got to see it it's the big it's like the biggest city ever and so I was like okay here we go Jump On In let's go so he's been everywhere he's been to many cities on many continents he knows a lot of things and we go up there we drive for the hour to get up there we park and we start walking in and in about three minutes into going to San Francisco he's like oh this is the dirtiest City City I've ever been to and this was in like 2015 it's so much worse it's so much worse and so when they're just like by the way people now live in pods it's like really who didn't see this one coming who did not see this one coming because this is not shocking at all all right let's see what horrible human invention San Francisco has yet again foed upon Humanity San Francisco city investig are now looking into the mint Plaza pod housing complex here's what the Pod standard multi-millionaire Tech bro this is pretty standard multi-millionaire San Francisco housing uh probably coming in probably like a cool $3 $1,400 a month pretty spacious I would say uh pretty nice kind of feels you know it this this is pretty good room I mean I love the view first off the view is just incredible for this uh second off he probably lives right off of Market Street really able to just enjoy his experience of San Francisco and the nice part is what you know he's paying so little compared to everybody else I mean think about all those suckers that are paying like $45,000 a month for their studio apartment I mean this guy is really winning okay this guy is really winning it looks like we first told you about this last week that's when we spoke with one of the tenants about what makes it so inviting I actually I really I I don't think you could spin that statement more as a a as a journalist than anything else we talked to one of the local residents why is it so inviting to live in a square H how is it tell me by tell me why it's so amazing you right now pushed off coming to San Francisco for a really long time but it's been absolutely net positive without a doubt like just within the first couple of days I met some of the smartest people I've met in my entire life so uh that's the reason I came and that's the reason I'm staying and that's the reason why I'm living in a pod you know the Silicon Valley show would have easily I mean I think I'm shocked that they didn't create this as like a situation already but this like writes itself it's if it wasn't a tragedy this would be a comedy it's just so sad you know really smart people you know that's why I'm living in P you know we're brain power okay the brain power in the valley is so heavy I mean honestly genuinely I do feel bad about that like I know that people want to live in cities some people love cities I I don't blame me for loving cities Great Food uh there's a lot of walkable situations going on long as you just have absolutely no like life responsibility having a kid in a city is just awful dog water straight straight dog water but if you just are living that single Carefree life cities are great City cities are fine I'm sure I'm sure it's a blast uh but man if you're living in a city and to justify living there you have to live in a pod as somebody making over six figures there just is something about it that just feels broken well don't know how long that's going to last because the city's department of building inspection is going to determine if developers had the proper permits to build the pods AI Founders artists and Retail workers are currently in those pods there's a total of 20 of them and they cost $700 a month to live in The Firm managing the development has not oh my goodness what a scam oh my goodness they it's not even that big of a place you saw how small the pods are and they're raking in approximately $14,000 a month damn it's just so look I mean look this girl feels the same thing I feel they're just shocked right now shook we're shook oh that is just beautiful it's beautiful and completely unsurprising that pod living is going to be something of San Francisco's future uh I don't know if you've been up there I I I kid you not this was in like 2015 so this is before prices started to really take off in the valley okay we're not talking about anything what they are today and I remember I was working with somebody and they're like hey guess what we're buying a house I'm like oh really I thought you lived in San Francisco and they're like oh yeah we're buying a place in San Francisco I'm like nice you you're buying a place in uh San Francisco what you buying they're like we're buying a studio apartment so first off I didn't even I didn't even realize you could buy a studio like I didn't even realize that buying a studio was like an option okay I thought you rented a studio I didn't realize you bought one and so bought a studio apartment the two this is 2015 again 2015 and I'm like okay you're buying a studio nice he's like yeah it's really spacious Studio there's like this kitchen and we got a and then you know like we have this like artificial wall for our bedroom okay okay you got a studio how much does a studio run you up there in San Francisco he lived up in San Francisco and he's like $700,000 to buy this studio apartment this was eight years ago this is a real story someone told me that it was a great deal it's probably 1.8 million now it's probably 1.8 million but it's real like San Francisco is a crazy place so is this shocking that there's pods no I don't think it's shocking at all that there's pods um this is just a reality it's not don't stop baiting me we all know I mean this is the problem about cities in general when they get hyper filled with stuff and you have the thing that makes San Francisco so jacked up is that EV like it's where all the VC money is all just like crushed into one small area and so you just have like it's the most dystopian place you will you will visit I walked down like I'm going to be going to the next JS conference here in a couple weeks and when I go there I will literally walk through an entire like a field of homeless people while people sleeping in Teslas are driving by I mean it's like Judge Dread you're you're you're effectively watching Judge Dread just without the judges it's the American dream I not my American Dream not my American Dream hashtag that not my American Dream it's extremely dystopian yeah they have the inverse of Judge Dread there's no law enforcement or judges I live in a small City okay my city has 70,000 people spread over the size of about 10 San franciscos great place absolutely love it absolutely love it um I love open areas I love that kind of stuff that's me though I'd much rather have some space I'd rather walk out with a field do I ever get bored what would I get bored of there's so there's that's the thing is there's actually things to do in a smaller place like have you ever okay a good example is let's pretend you live in a big place lots of people oh what do you want to do oh it doesn't matter what you want to do everybody is already doing it you want to just do quick pick up groceries well there's about 1,00 people ahead of you in line oh you want to go on that nice little hike right outside of town get in line to go on your hike to go enjoy nature on your cemented trail with handguards to prevent you from getting off the trail while you walk in line and people are passing you this way and you're just like that's not not enjoying nature that's not touching grass okay you're not touching nothing you want to loot stores already hundreds of people looting the stores okay it just ruins the whole looting experience if you can't you don't it's like you don't even get Freshies okay you don't even get the Freshies you have to go you have to like pick over handpicked Goods uh oh you want to have a nice little ski getaway well it's going to be about a uh it's going to be about a 4-Hour drive to Tahoe and when you make it to Tahoe there's going to be about another hour hour long super slow drive to get into Tahoe and then you will stand in line for the rest of the time every single ski lift is going to be like 150 people ahead of you and just everything line line line line line right H there are no Freshies there has not been Freshies in in Tahoe in 10 years right just buy a house and Tahoe skill issue even then buy a house and Tahoe you got crazy traffic you still got crazy ski lifts uh yeah no no Warren first off Warren it's Idaho's a really great state right Warren Idaho is really great right Warren Warren warrren say Idaho is a great state I love Idaho see exactly so all of you Californians and everybody else you can go to Idaho cuz it's a great state go to the panhandle of Idaho probably pretty cool yeah definitely don't
