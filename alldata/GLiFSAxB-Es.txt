so I tweeted this an hour ago and uh ruffled some feathers a lot of questions and I figured I'd take a moment and talk to you about exactly kind of what's going on here and what do I mean by lead code is mid well okay so something you need to understand is that I am uh doing hiring at Netflix I've done a lot of interviews in the past and I'll tell you one thing that has changed a lot over the last 10 years which is our industry doesn't put as much emphasis on deep hard technical problems as much as I've seen a lot lately just basic data structure problems and so a good piece of advice is to understand basic data structures instead of doing these really you know overly complex annoying Edge casing leap code problems that could never be done in an interview understand exactly what a linked list array list a doubly linked list like the differences between those graph tree depth first breath first search a heap how to use a heap when to use a heap just know your basic data structures and you can go into almost any interview and do fairly well because most problems break down to one of those few data structures now second also what I mean by this is that people think that that's the most important part of getting a job is nailing that one super technical part of your interview I'll tell you this much is that having a good project having things built in public that will do so much more to attract the eye of employers than having yourself completing like 900 lead code problems because here's the deal you have 900 lead code problems completed hey guess what congratulations no one sees it nobody cares but you know what you have a good project that has like 800 stars on it because you saw a need you built it you maintained it you communicated that right there is 1 000 times more likely to be relevant in getting hired than your lead code so do projects become good understand Technologies don't be around on League code Forever okay that's all I gotta say I hope you enjoyed this little little knowledge bomb okay hey side Channel fun you know what hey subscribe baby
