hey friends welcome to tiffin tech where we talk about everything from coding career [Music] take two [Music] hey friends welcome back to tiffin tech where we talk about everything from coding career technology and beyond basically all the videos i make no i don't want to get into that take three hey friends welcome back to tiffin tech where we talk about everything from technology coding career and beyond today i'm really excited because we are going to be building a game in python together we are going to be going through the code and really building this really exciting project that no matter what experience you have with python i am pretty sure you can follow along which is really exciting also when we are going through this tutorial we are going to be using the new logitech mx mechanical and mx master 3s the new keyboard and melts as you know i have been using logitech products for ever it feels like i mean for years now i have their previous version of the mx keyboard and mx mouse and i've been using it for years and years it's my go-to i love it so when uh i got to try out the latest versions of this i am so excited and we're going to be going through some of the specs with it as well as i know a lot of you are looking to upgrade or build your own kind of home office and equipment with it so i thought this would be really fun to combine the two for the keyboard i got the mx mechanical wireless keyboard full size which includes a number pad this was really important to me because i had it on my last one and i use it a lot especially when i am calculating different numbers or doing anything just that i want a similar kind of like a calculator next to me and that always comes in handy and for the switches i got the tactile quiet so it's mechanical key switches with a satisfying tactile bump you feel is how they explain it and i really like that because you can feel the mechanical keyboard the i don't know what it is you can feel it really well how it is a mechanical keyboard which i love that feeling but also too a lot of times i have people coming and going um from my house you know my boyfriend works from home sometimes so i don't want to annoy him or others around me by like typing and them having to hear it so i chose the quiet one and then for the mouse i got the mx master 3s and i really like this because i mean i i've loved the the previous one i had as well and some of the things the features that really stood out to me on this one include 90 less click noise which is huge uh scroll 1000 lines per second this comes in handy when i am doing content creation going through scripts or when i am coding or going through a code base this is huge and also too it's so comfortable they really have crafted this mouse for comfort okay hi friends again just from a different angle where i can see my computer and i'm also screen recording so you will see what we are building as well so for this we are building a tetris game in python using pygame we will be using python 3 and i'm really excited about this also also before going further just listen to the sound of this mechanical keyboard keep in mind i got this the quietest one but oh i wish you could just feel how good it feels [Applause] i'm hooked i'm hooked it makes me want to code more to be honest okay so as you can see on the screen here i am creating a new rebel replit i always have trouble saying that one but i am creating a new rebel which i will link down below so you can follow along as well while we create this tetris game now first thing you need to do in rebel or if you're not using rebel it's fine as well but if you are make sure in the template you choose actually pie game rather than python from there create raffle okay now there are a few things we need to import before we start the first one we need to import is pie game and the other is random so import thai game and we cannot spell today okay next up we need to have some colors that will uh be associated to the different blocks that are coming down in tetris so for that we are going to make an array and in there we need some different colors so it's going to essentially be oops rgb colors in there and i am going to do seven different colors let's do a blue [Music] okay next up we need to have a list of potential figures and when i say figures i mean different ways essentially that the shapes will be coming down so oftentimes it is vertical horizontal then there's this like upside down t and the other one is kind of like a i don't know what i'm doing here i'll put it on screen but a different shape as well so we will have to do a essentially a list of different uh potential figures that will be coming down on screen so as you can see here we have figures and class figure and essentially all these numbers what they will represent is the different uh positions in a 4x4 matrix where the figure is complete or the figure is solid essentially and once again if you're not totally understanding this point just just type along we i promise you it will be a beautiful result okay next up we need to add some say missing figures and also too we need to be able to randomly pick a type and color so let's start coding just that [Music] okay so let's take a little pause as i have been trying out the keyboard and mouse for a while now and one of my favorite things which is i didn't actually record but halfway through the tutorial i needed to go on my work computer and one of my favorite things about the keyboard is the multi-device meaning you can connect it up to three different devices and whether it's mac os windows ios ipad android chrome os and linux so pretty much any anything you have you can connect it to and that goes same with the mouse which i think is so huge as a lot of us need a keyboard and mouse that can be versatile also as many of you know i do work part-time from a co-working space and oftentimes i end up i'm not i don't know if there's a meme for this or not but i'm that person who brings my keyboard and mouse with me to bring my whole homework from home office basically and it's really nice that it has quiet typing so unlike a lot of mechanical keyboards that are very loud and clunky this is not like that at all it has three different available switch types which is tactile quiet linear and clicky and as i mentioned earlier in this video i picked tactile quiet so i still get that mechanical keyboard feel it still does have some noise but it is very quiet noise and it's not going to disturb anyone okay next up we need to actually initialize the game with some variables so we need to know uh the state if we have been playing it or not we need to know the field which will be zero if it doesn't contain any of the blocks and if so if it does contain the blocks it will have the colors there and there's a few other things we need to define here so let's get to it [Music] also as you can tell the file is getting pretty long and honestly already i mean it's going to get longer but already it comes the scroll on the mouse it's just amazing it comes in handy how fast you can go and this is just this isn't even 200 lines like this is nothing yet and i mean it's not going to be crazy but i'm just saying you can imagine how handy the scroll comes into when you're working with a large code base as well okay so i did add some code here that we didn't really go through and that was for the purpose of not spending two hours with you on this but rather uh just pause the video or click down below to get this code as well and we will go through it rather than just line by line so in here as you can see we need to set the height the width the field the score uh the state which is start then we also need to go down a little bit and create a new figure and position uh and for this one we did the coordinates three and zero and now as you can see in here in intersects what this allows us to do is be able to check each cell or each block in the four by four matrix of the current figure and find out if it is in or out of game bounds and if it is touching some game field that is already busy so essentially it allows for us to check if we are able to or allowed to move or rotate the figure okay and as you can see there's go space down freeze go side and rotate so we got it all here okay next up we actually need to initialize this game and get going on that portion so let's do that so let's define some colors to start with and for this let's do let's do kind of basic colors let's go here and do maybe let's just do like kind of boring colors so let's do like uh green and then we'll do black and gray okay cool let's do those three so green is do we get this already actually let's do navy this is kind of nice instead of black and for gray let's do where is our gray let's do this color i know it's not gray like you said but it's kind of a nice color do size the size which will be 400 500 and we also need to oops let's do it and let's set the caption you can set it to whatever you want let's do best okay so as you can see i added in some more code again just because once again we'd be here forever uh but it's super straightforward so of course after we added in the colors and the caption what we did was set the variables initially so um the game the counter and pressing down will start to equal false and then as you can see here uh for the event in pi game dot event get we have different options for the keyboard so if you do key down key up right left all those main kind of key keyboard uh motions for tetris and then this is really cool here um adding in some font uh to adding in some font and also to some text for the score so right now it's just score and then it will be in the color green that we added and also to what we'll do is if game state is equal to game over then it will show this really well actually let me just show you i think we find it this way and see this is why it's so important that you did pie game and not just python or else we wouldn't get this uh ui up here no one said i was an expert at playing the game okay this is really fun though but we'll wait let's see what it looks like when we lose just i can show you game over press escape and then we can play again it's a pretty fun game i linked it down in the description i also linked the tutorial that i initially followed for this and i also linked my reply and everything else thank you all for watching this video i hope you enjoyed going through that python tutorial i linked it down in the description and i also link down in the description the logitech mx mechanical keyboard and mx master 3s mouse so make sure to go check them out thanks everyone [Music] okay
