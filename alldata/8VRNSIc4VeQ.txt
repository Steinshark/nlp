hey friends welcome back to my channel today we are going to be following a tutorial which i have linked down below and this is part of the code with me series where we're taking different tutorials together and learning different parts of code as someone who's been a software developer professionally for over four years even though these are things that are not new to me i love going through them with you to really remind me of getting back to basics and then for anyone who is learning how to code i think it's a great way to be motivated to code uh kind of like your virtual coding buddy before we get into it though make sure to hit that subscribe button for more tech and coding related videos also i wanted to say a big thank you to superhuman for sponsoring part of this video speaking of productivity and using tools such as pomodoro method one other tool i love to use is superhuman i've been using superhuman for a while now and honestly it's like my emails but on superpowers i'll show you more about my favorite features here superhuman essentially use technology to rebuild your inbox from how you read triage and organize your inbox this can all be done faster with superhuman my favorite features of it include the split inbox which is aid power which is pretty cool what this does it will actually it's called automatic triage and what it does is it will group your emails by type so unlike manually filing messages in your folders you do not need to lift a finger automatic triage is like using folders but with zero effort you can tackle emails in batches with minimal task switching okay another thing i love about superhuman probably one of my favorite things is remind me have you ever been in the position where you're out and about an email comes in you read the basics of it but you know you can't reply then and there only to fast forward a few days later realizing you never ever responded it's the worst feeling with superhuman this is completely taken out of the equation now so one of my favorite features with remind me is when you're out and about you can actually tap which call which is called on desktop and superhuman will remind you as soon as you're back on desktop so this is a great way if i get an email when i'm out and about and looking at my phone all i need to do is click on desktop then when i open my computer monday morning after a weekend i see that i need to respond to this email i link superhuman down in the description so you can check them out honestly they have been a game changer for me so if you are someone who doesn't enjoy email you need to check out superhuman because it's a great way to make you more efficient on it and spend less time in it okay now that we have our email covered with superhuman let's start diving into building a pomodoro app okay let's just dive right in i'm so excited to make this because well a it's been forever that since i've made a pomodoro app and b i use a pomodoro app every single day to work so the fact that we're making something we can use i just love to do and let's just dive right into it okay so i have the tutorial open here and then on screen here i will have my code and let's start coding okay to start for this project we can clone on already existing starter files from github repository uh so let's start doing that by doing git clone next once you have the repository cloned let's cd into it now we need to install any packages that came with it using npm install okay perfect now i'm going to open this project up in vs code [Music] and from here i'm going to run npm start [Music] okay so now what you can see on screen on your local host as well should be kind of the skeleton i guess you could say of the pomodoro app so what came with these starter files is essentially the ui for it so we don't have to build that out and we can focus more on the logic so we can see here this is what it will look like but if you click anything nothing's going to actually work the first thing we need to do is update the timer in main js so it has the appropriate amount of minutes we want so right now main.js is empty but we're going to make a const timer and have that equal to the amount of time we want for the short break the long break the break interval and then also to the pomodoro time so the 25 minutes usually let's start by typing in pomodoro [Music] okay now what we need to do is create a listener that listens for when any of the three buttons on uh the screen are clicked so palma pomodoro short break and lawn break so what we're going to do just underneath timer is go const mode buttons and this will equal document dot query selector in which case we are going to do the id js mode buttons oops and then we will add an event listener which will listen for the click then we will also pass in something called handle mode which is something we will create right underneath of here function and this handle mode will essentially handle which one is clicked pomodoro short break or long break again [Music] if no mode [Music] returned nothing and then let's call the switch mode method here which will pass in the mode okay this might be a little confusing right now and that's totally fine just go with it i promise you as we continue coding it will make more sense and as we get a bit further i mentioned this in another tutorial but one of the best ways or best things you can do is comment out some lines of code or console log some lines of code and see what it does exactly what's getting passed in and also when you comment out some lines of code it breaks things and it's a good way to understand okay this is for this part or this breaks this part and it makes it more clear when you actually break things so my biggest tip always is break things okay next we're going to add in the switch mode because we're calling switch mode but as you can see we don't actually have the method made out for it so next up we are going to do is make a function for switch mode now in the tutorial we are following they have the code there so i'm literally just going to copy and paste it if you have some time and i really want to learn this deeply i would suggest to write it out yourself but i'm going to copy and paste it so we can really walk through what the code is actually doing okay so as you can see here and as it says in the tutorial the switch mode function adds two new properties to the timer object so to this object here the first mode is a property which is set to the current mode so it could be pomodoro short break or long break and then next remaining time here you can see uh is set on the timer so that is an object which contains three different properties of its own total minutes and seconds and of course total is the number of time remaining minutes is the number of minutes for this mode and seconds is always set to zero to start with okay so let's go ahead and save that for now [Music] okay as you can see when we're reading the code there is another function that is being called which is yet to be made which is the update clock function so once again we are going to go ahead and make that function for update clock the remaining time will equal the timer the minutes will equal [Music] okay so for i'm gonna actually stop here and then so for the update clock function as you can see i did pad start on both of them and what this does is it pads them with zeros where necessary so for example uh the number always has an equivalent of two so if the number is eight it will be zero eight but if the number is twelve it will stay 12 1 2. and what this does is it keeps it consistent from singular numbers is that what is that a word singular numbers two singular numbers so one two nine or zero to nine and then also two keeps it consistent when there are numbers that have at least two two numbers in them so 10 and onwards okay so let's finish this function out go const min get element by id and in this case we want to get js minutes and then const seconds which will be actually make this con sec keep it consistent with the tutorial bro [Music] okay now let's pull up our timer again and see how it's looking so we have update clock function done so when we go to short break we should see five and you can see it's changing colors which is really awesome and i'll show you where that's coming from in a sec here long break is 15. so you can change these colors to what they are by going into style.css and you can see here this is where the colors are coming from so pick whatever color palette you want if you don't like the ones that are chosen uh and this is a fun way to kind of personalize it a little bit i'm going to keep it as is for this tutorial but yeah i kind of like the colors they're very calming okay next thing we need to do is actually start the timer so when we click on start it will start so now what we need to do is declare an interva interval variable below the timer so let's go back to main.js and here is timer so right below it let's make some space here and go let interval and as it says here the variable will be assigned to an instant of set interval method in a new start timer function which should be added just above the update clock okay so let's go to update clock where is that right here and let's add in this new function once again i'm just going to copy and paste it because it's right in the tutorial itself and then we can walk through the code okay so as we can see here before we can actually start the timer we need to get the exact time in the future when the timer will end or else how does the timer know when to end so to do that how we do it is we retrieve the timestamp of the current moment through date.parse right here which is the end time and then the interval variable is set let's see here and then if we go down a bit you can see the interval variable which we declared up here let interval the interval variable will now be set to the remaining time and this will help us keep track of how much time is remaining okay and once again we have made another function here get remaining time which we need to add in okay so let's put it right above start timer and this remaining time so the end time is getting passed in from down here as you can see and time here so now we know when this end time is passed in what it is so we take the difference so the end time minus the current time which is right up here and that difference will come in handy when we are calculating the total and then also as well you can see we are calculating the minutes and seconds okay i feel like we're almost there we're doing really good we might have to take a coffee break and come back it's essential i feel like especially if you are rather new to coding and going through this tutorial to take some breaks so this is your sign if you're following along let's go take a break [Music] okay we are back we are good to go we're ready to go let's get back into it so as if you remember the last thing we did was get the remaining time and now what we need to do is we need to actually call start timer function so when the main button is clicked this function actually starts so now we will add the following code above the mode buttons variable okay so we're going to take this code here for main button if you're following along in the tutorial and we are going to add it just above mode buttons right here [Music] so what this is doing as you can see it's getting the element by id the js slash button or dash button and then adding an event listener for click and then when the click happens the action the start timer function will actually be called okay so we need to make a small change into the start timer method or function so the button text changes to stop it says so let's do that as you can see in the code here or in the tutorial we need to go back in start timer function [Music] here we go and then underneath const and time we actually need to add in a little bit more text [Music] okay so we just put in some code here from mainbutton.dataset.action and text content and also to classic classlist.ad so we can add the class active okay so let's see what it looks like now let's save our file go here refresh and start it's not starting that's okay we don't need to freak out start okay so i press start and as you can see now the stop is a hard hardware button so you can't actually click it again it's already going okay so let's go back to the tutorial and they say here a final thing to do in this section is to ensure the mode and remaining time properties are set on timer object on page load so let's go back to main.js and to do so it says we can execute switch mode property once the dom content is loaded or event is fired okay so let's go back to here and refresh and see how it's going so as you can see now it is going down we are starting our work um this is pretty exciting we're getting pretty far on this and this tutorial is so easy to follow honestly with such great explanations so as i mentioned i linked it down below in the description so i really hope as we are going through that you are following along with me because the whole point of this is that we can learn together um although i've been a software developer for four years professionally this is it's still fun to make small and simple projects together and just kind of learn new things so this isn't necessarily new to me but it's always a great reminder of getting back to basics okay the last thing we are going to do in this tutorial is stop the timer there is other parts of it though so i really encourage you once we are complete to continue on with this but i hope this will give you a head start through the tutorial so next it says we need to of course add a new function called stop timer we have one for start now we need one for stop let's add that right underneath the start timer function which is stop timer so in this function as you can see clear interval method is invoked and that causes set interval method to be triggered in start timer interval as you can see here and then start timer right here now as it says in the tutorial we need to execute stop timer when the data action is set to stop and modify the main button event listener as shown below so let's go back into the main event listener um main button yes okay and what we need to do is so we have that if action is equal to start start timer but we also need to add else stop timer and we also need to stop the timer when the mode is changed by clicking any of the three buttons from the countdown so let's go back into handle mode function and right here underneath switch mode it says to add stop timer which will be called okay let's go let's see how this is working now drum roll please okay start stop we did it we made our pomodoro timer there's once again so much more you can do for this project and add on to it but this is a great place to i think stop this tutorial and let you kind of take it on from here so i'm curious to know leave in the comments if you continue on with it and how it looks if you end up pushing this to github link it down below uh this is a really fun project and it's something that is super useful okay this was the third video from this series of code with me where we are virtual coding buddies and building things together and i want to know what are some other things you want to build together leave in the comments because that's why i make these videos if you haven't already make sure to also check out superhuman link is in the description and once again this has been a complete game changer for me so i'm really excited to share it with you thank you all for watching this video i hope you found it very valuable and fun and i will see you all soon thanks everyone [Music] bye
