my machine learning prop said something super interesting in class yesterday and I want to share it with you he said if you want to remain relevant in the next 5 years you need to know Ai and that kind of took me off guard at first when he first said it honestly it kind of annoyed me I said that's ridiculous it's yes it's important yes it's growing but the M like if you want to stay relevant you need to know it that seems extreme he went on to explain exactly what he meant more so behind the scenes meaning no you don't need to be an expert in the field you don't even need to be technical in the field but being aware of it having an understanding of what is going on will keep you relevant and I do believe that I agree with that full-heartedly which brings up the next question how do you keep up with AI how do you learn about machine learning especially nowadays when everywhere you look everyone is talking about it there are so many resources you just want to build something and that is what we are going to go through today today I'm going to share with you how exactly you can start building using data using Python and analyzing this data with the help of AI so here's what we're going to do we are going to take unique data from Bright data which I've built with bright data in the past I'll link my previous videos down below I absolutely love them been using their product for well years now and they recently released data sets these are predefined data sets that you can use they're already ready to go so you don't need to go in and do any web scraping with this data set mind you I should share with you about what data set I chose I chose the data set of real estate specifically zillow's real EST State data for homes in La yeah because I'm moving to La you heard that right moving to La quit my job becoming a full-time YouTuber I'm just kidding I'm I'm doing none of the above don't worry I'm staying here in Canada still working full-time and doing way too much on the side but that's okay I love you all point being though is we are taking this real estate data and going to analyze it with chat GPT from there I'm going to share with you some really cool tricks and ways that you can create graphs in chat GPT but better yet see what what python code was utilized to create these graphs so then you can learn at a faster rate about python about how it works behind the scenes so you can then take this code take your learnings and go and build your own machine learning algorithms and applications and if you want to follow along to this I linked bright data down below so make sure to go sign up download some data and get started all right speaking of let's get started enough talking let's get into it taking you to my dining room table because I still don't have my my camera stand here all right you can see here I have opened bright data and as I mentioned I will link down below some other videos I've done in the past with bright data I absolutely love to use them and as I am taking this Ai and machine learning course I feel like I don't feel like I am going to be using them a lot more frequently as well so let's go through uh what exactly are data sets that you can have access to so you can see here there are different categories so from B2B data e-commerce real estate which we are going to dive into today Etc now this is such a great way if you are building your own application from scratch maybe you're learning about machine learning maybe learning about machine learning you get what I'm saying or you are part of a company and you are looking for existing data this is a great way that you don't have to go out and uh utilize a web scraper but it already exists for you which is huge and for me I'm going to utilize this a lot more as I am building out machine learning applications and really needing data to work with so it's a win-win whether you are using it for your own project or your business all right it's enough of me talking about that but what I did is I chose to use real estate data because as I said earlier I'm moving to La becoming a full-time YouTuber and taking you with me there I'm just kidding you know my sense of humor by now all right so let's go here into my data sets you can see here I have a few data sets of Zillow I'm going to be working with a smaller one right now just because I wanted to get very specific in this data set and now I want to show you something if I go into here something really cool especially different ways you can work with this data so one thing as you can see I've set up beforehand is to use Google cloud storage and you can access your data through that way this is a really great way especially if you're working with large data sets and want to call um different apis for this data now there's Amazon S3 there is uh snowflake I mean the it really ranges to all the popular delivery settings which is great in this way though we you know us we always like to do it a little bit more spicy so we are going to download this uh CSV file here and this is pretty quick to download but while it's downloading I'm not wearing a watch let's insert some programming jokes here or some texer all right it is downloaded let's continue on all right you can see here now I am in chat GPT and I've uploaded the CSV file of our data now let's start with a very simple prompt before we get into how we can really utilize this to create graphs and also to see what's going on behind the scenes with the python code so let let's just start with summarize this data for me and this is just to get familiar with what how chat GPT essentially is feeling about the data and what's kind of going on there this is very basic prompt now we're [Music] [Music] analyzing all right so you can see here I got this answer very detailed actually considering ing there is over 8,000 entries of data which is pretty wild so it really summarized it up nicely as to what these entries entail such as time stamp City Home status address Etc that I think is a good first step for me even though I knew what was in this data set just having it kind of recapped summarized nicely is a great way to start now let's get into the fun stuff I have here I created a prompt which says make a bar chart of the top five homes in La that are built after 2015 and are in the mid-range of price options so let's see what happens when I type this in here the whole goal of this one is as someone who is shopping for real estate in La for example they want to see homes that are built after 2015 and aren't at the high-end range of pricing but also not the low end let's go let's go mid here now I really wanted to show you how you can create charts within chat GPT using our essentially our own real estate GPT through feeding it this data what you can do is create these really good charts and then also see how they are built with python for example how it's actually analyzing this data this is a great way if you are learning about machine learning and really wanting to understand what's going on behind the scenes with python but also too if you are someone who's more on the business side and want to present this data to maybe stakeholders or maybe to your clients it is so easy to do now with AI which is pretty incredible now I always get asked is this going to take over jobs especially in this scenario is this going to take over data analyst jobs or data science jobs and absolutely not we are so far from that but why not lean into this tooling that exists and you can help you with analyzing different parts of data so you can do bigger bigger projects bigger tasks at hand okay so you can see here I created this this or chat GPT I I'm taking work credit for ai's work now um my prompt was make a bar chart of the top five homes in La that are built after 2015 and are mid-range in price now this I'll be honest with you this chart I was going to cut it from the video I was like it didn't really do what I wanted the wording could have been clearer but I thought we are close on this channel and I always include my mistakes or where I could have improved so I'm doing it for this too why I didn't like this chart is a few reasons one it does not visualize what I was hoping it would in a great way it's kind of ugly to be frank and it doesn't get across the data in a proper way also to the pricing here is all jumbled it just AI not AI here but I think it's still interesting because what it will do is you can go to view analysis and you can see here the code uh that was used in Python to create this chart and I also like how it does a really good job of explaining each part of this code so if you are someone who is learning python or wanting to get more into the data space machine learning space it's so helpful and I'm saying that because I am someone who's doing this exact same thing and using this analysis to understand as to what is going on okay first we're filtering for LA and ensuring that the year built is after 2015 and going through um you know how they are finding the mid-range in price homes selecting the top five homes this is gold when you are learning something new it is literally walking you through it and as long as you understand as to what it is doing it is key this also too what you can do when you are working with uh different data sets you can use chat GPT to do your version of it before you use chat GPT and then come back to chat GPT if you get stuck and use it as a helper in this way all right but as you can see this chart didn't really get to what I was hoping it would to so what I did then was I created another prompt which is create for me a pillar chart that shows the average cost of the top 10 most common zip codes and the average price of a two-bedroom home I mean I need two bedrooms I need one for me and I need one for my dogs maybe I need 20 bedrooms because I want 20 dogs that's a different conversation anyways not happening but uh as you can see here this is what I was really looking for so just just a few tweaks in the wording even from create for me a pillar chart um get more specific about what you're looking for and there you go so now it does a really nice summary as to what this pillar chart is showing and then also too if you go to this view analysis again it will show you the python code so you can literally copy the code input it into your IDE and build upon that so whether it's you know you want to use something like repple where it's you can just select a python environment and start building you want to use any local IDE whatever the case is but you have this code you can really build upon you can also do cool things like this so say go copy code and let me zoom out here put the code back into chat GPT and go can you explain to me more about what this plotting is doing just using this as an example if you're really wanting to understand what is going on and teach yourself more about python at a quicker Pace quicker rate [Music] all right you can see here so it explains exactly what was going on with plotting and I stopped it after number two because it kept on giving me these like pages of answers which is a good thing in the sense that if you really wanting to understand everything you can or prompted to be more specific uh but you can see here it talks about filtering data sets for two-bedroom homes and then also to finding the top 10 most common zip codes and how it did that I mean we always talk about technology or especially AI taking over jobs or being a negative thing but look what it is doing in these examples we are literally learning because of AI and chat GPT in particular it's at such a faster rate and I really believe if you are not someone who is learning in this way meaning using these tools at your what is it tools at your disposal you're going to fall behind and as we know it's Tech keeps on moving faster so do not fall behind oh you know the last thing we need to do is I kind of showed you earlier but we didn't really dive into it what is the average home price four different zip codes can we talk about this ZIP code 919 the average price is almost 17 million what is this ZIP code let's Google it here one sec let's go 900 one9 zip code why are you so expensive [Music] very nice very [Music] nice let's see now let's go on Zillow where we're getting this data and see what these homes look like I don't want my emails on here so let me just take that away okay yeah you know I could I could live here I could get down with this I don't know about the door though anyways this is so cool this data was literally coming from Zillow we got it from Bright data we do not have to scrape a thing using this data set then to interact and learn with chat GPT AI learn about Python and now we can go build with python and analyze further data data sets that are given to us from Bright data it's kind of incredible honestly sorry I had a moment there I was just thinking how I the pain I went through when I was first learning to code without the help of AI and all these tools probably a good thing wow people who are just starting to learn out these new technologies now you have it so good take advantage of it grow learn okay I love you all and I will see you all soon oh most importantly I linked bright data down below so go check it out today go build something today go play with it today this is essential if you want to stand out I mean the job market right now is so tough that one of the ways the best ways that you can stand out is through side projects showing you are building creating different things whether you are technical or not this is something you can do and will help you in your career all right I'll see you all soon thanks everyone leave in the comments what do you want to build [Music] [Applause] [Music] next
