now you had a particular role in Afghanistan you said for example that you were searching women I was searching women right so and that that's a specific role for women and you believe that that's a useful role what now what what do you think what do you think has been the consequence in general of introducing women into the Armed Forces I mean there's there's obviously continual sexual scandals in the armed forces in Canada it's always been there we just haven't reported it okay meaning meaning it's always been there in what way because there has been women in the Army right just not in combat arms roles in other countries for us there has so those assaults have been going on for the the individual for example I won't say his name he's got a world to hurt anyway uh who told me that I it would have been easier if I died he's been charged with seven sexual assaults but he made it to Major and he's not being arrested or put in jail and he's getting to leave with a pension so what does that say to everyone else below him do it just make sure they're quiet about it and that's why keeps happening we don't actually take accountability for our actions we never have because if we did it would stop okay so I I read a an article in the Canadian military Journal I don't remember the name of the journal but it was their Dei um uh issue right and they're what would you say recommendation for decreasing the frequency of the sorts of things that you're talking about was a retooling of the entire culture of the Canadian military well I don't exactly understand what that means because the culture is going to be a War culture right and I presume that there are downsides to that as well as upsides I don't I don't know how to understand the downsides in terms of the relationship between men and women but if if you have a lot of young men together who are single and a lot of young women together who are single then there's obviously going to be uh sexual interactions on a Non-Stop basis and I have no idea how that can be like reasonably regulated I suspect that the Dei approach is not going to work very effectively no sleep is a foundation for our

Canadian military has just put tampons in the bathrooms yeah yeah and then and then made it uh what a particularly punishable offense for the young men to take the tampon dispensers out of the bathrooms which is obviously exactly what they should do they should never have been in there in the first place well yes that's for sure yeah so bad leadership right you might say that already we can go with bad leadership that rolls downhill we have a saying in the military uh rolls downhill and so that's obvious so Dei is rolling downhill and it's rolling down to a already crippling military our military complex in Canada is shrinking astronomically and not only that it's shrinking because veterans aren't being looked after uh people at gag 10 are having to rely on food banks to eat because they're not being paid enough uh no weapon systems are coming in people are having to pay for their own flights come back from where did they go was it Lithuania they were over there excuse me they were playing War Games I.E they were just trying to be a show of force or Putin anyway so and then we bring in Dei so here's what's happened since I got out this was a trip I got to go back in 2021 22 to New Brunswick to go shoot my last round as a gunner I didn't know this was a thing but when you're like super old or something really bad happens they bring you back to shoot your last round you are you super old or something bad going to be 35 this year Jordan so we're going to go with something bad happened and they really messed up and they know it and there was a book written about it they didn't like it so so what happened was I went and I shot my last round and it was this you know all the big wigs came out and all of this and it was amazing because there was actually a female there that was a colonel that I actually respected and so it was a really big honor to get to shoot with her and so I'm there but what I saw was really troubling to me dis shuffled beards long nails piercings jewelry weird colored hair and beards we had lost the standard we stopped doing the standards of what it meant to be in the service men have to be clean shaven women have to have short nails you have to have one earring you can only wear wear wedding band like you don't do these things their hair was a mess they just looked a mess and I said what am I looking at here so this is the new standard so if you start to lower the standards people who have Serv served like my friend Dallas Alexander who got slapped by the government for going on Shawn Ryan people like that leave right the experienced people who you need to teach these standards the best people leave oh 100% And so this is what's happening so now you've got Dei so what happens with Dei well Basics that we know men now are in women's spaces vulnerable spaces men now are allowed around women in environments that they just shouldn't be in service in General meaning we we normally get our own shower time right and where we get our if we have enough women we get our own tent if you didn't you just you you're with the guys and you're used to it's fine and so what was happening is people say that it's an assault issue it's a control issue it's a leadership who has been told time and time and time again you can get away with it it doesn't matter you're going to get away with it if you're high enough rank you got the right people around you you're going to get away with that so what does that say to women it says well I don't really want to be in the service so now you're losing women or you're having women transition to men so they're accepted in men's spaces and they're accepted as a male so maybe they won't get raped because you've got you had a Navy ship just have to come back recently uh in the United States because there was like 30 assaults in 30 days and women were just pimping themselves out early so they didn't get raped they said well I'll just do it now because then that way I won't get assaulted so it won't be like traumatic it'll be my choice and so people are saying well why are we why are we allowing women how about you just stop raping people guys where is the accountability on the man where is the accountability on the staff where is the accountability on the leadership to go hey if I catch you doing an assault this is what's happening to your out you're gone your your your job is over and you're going to have a dishonorable discharge for sexually assaulting someone then you're going to get a criminal charge why aren't we doing that well why do you think because we already have no one and also there's a lot of people that are old old school that are still in that are going to cover because oh what if a guy's like one year away from his pension Kelsey let's just let this one slide you don't want his family to not have any money right you don't want his family to lose his pension you don't want them to have that name in the school do you like it is a it's a hypocrisy there is the service is filled with some of the best people that we have to offer and then it's filled also with some of the worst we have to offer because it attracts a type person ity there's bad eggs and everything you know with the police yeah there's some bad eggs but they're not all bad and that's kind of what's happening with the service Bad Eggs not all bad removing funds what happens shittier people so it's happening in the police now it's happening in the service and we already have one of the smallest armies so we're being bought and paid for by the CCP left right and Center approvable by cesis on paper and then now we have weak borders no military no weapons running out of artillery rounds and giving how many billions of dollars somewhere else why would you want to join the service why what you can be patriotic and I applaud that I have people come to me all the time my daughter's going to join can you talk to her so I'm not going to talk anybody out of anything is their path if they believe they need to go do it they will go do it but at the same time I'm sorry this is not the country I fought for [Music]
