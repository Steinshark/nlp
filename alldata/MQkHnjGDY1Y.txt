controllers break and for some people they break often but just buy a new one right wrong even without getting all preachy about e-waste and toxic chemicals landfills yadda yadda controllers can be expensive difficult to replace or both so repairing broken ones makes a ton of sense microsoft recently confirmed the alleged shortage of current generation xbox wireless controllers that's been driving up prices and the ongoing retro gaming craze has resulted in skyrocketing demand for older controllers that simply aren't being manufactured at all anymore with more and more of them dying each year the good news is that we have the solution that's right it's good old right to repair back to save the day once again in most parts of the world replacement components for popular game controllers are pretty easy to come by so we asked our staff to bring in their precious broken hardware for us to take a look at that's right oh here it is the doctor is in so let's get started oh my god i'm gonna need some help from our sponsor amd if you're looking to upgrade or build a new gaming pc the game on amd sales event is on now until august 5th where you can get the best deals on amd ryzen and radeon products learn more today at the link down below depending on the model of the controller and the particular problem a repair job can be anywhere from dead simple to absolutely nightmarish and while i suspect that everything we look at today is going to be on the easier end of the spectrum you never know when you're going to crack open a wiimote and find that many of the pcb traces have been corroded away by battery shmu this has no internal battery meaning it should be a relatively easy one we're going to start here the super nintendo was my childhood so it would warm my heart to keep david's busted controller out of the landfill his problem is apparently both a broken start and select button let's get this baby cracked open [Music] wow that's some 1990s pcb right there david didn't even say that he had a broken right shoulder button well if it's not bothering him guess it doesn't bother me cable replacement seems to be a relatively simple operation this gives us a really good look at the internals of the controller it's very simple all membranes just like with the cheap keyboard so it works with this rubber nipple here that has a conductive material on the bottom of it that just connects two traces closing a circuit sending a signal to the connected device there are no joysticks which means we have none of the cost or complexity that accompany those the main points of failure then are either cracked nipples which these all seem to be fine or dirty contact points or dirty nipples which prevent the circuit from being closed so it's actually likely that a controller of this style can be repaired simply by cleaning it why don't we start with that obviously the start and select are the problem and wow this is dirty i don't know i'm getting a bit of a spill vibe here you can see whatever it was seeped through the start and select through the membrane here through the hole and around it and oh it's kind of oily yeah it's all over the board this is as gross as it is it's actually good news because it means it's very likely that this fix is as simple as just you grabbing a q-tip spraying some alcohol on it and giving this a wipe down yeah fumigate this thing since we're already in here we're going to use a smooth motion to clean off the bottoms of these other contact pads we're pretty lucky the originals are in good condition because while we did prepare by picking up a whole set of replacement membranes off of morotov games honestly they just do not feel as good as the originals even though the originals are over 25 years old at this point and it gets a lot worse than these like if you pick up random ones on amazon there's a good chance they're gonna feel pretty awful compared to the originals let's go ahead and put this back on then if this shoulder's not bothering david i guess it's not really my place to say that it's a problem right can i steal one from another controller yeah all right cool okay perfect so we're in pretty okay shape it's test time well it still works well start works all buttons are working david you're welcome your controller is saved our next victim this gamecube controller comes courtesy of our former editor taran in it presumably thanks to his spider-man 2-speed run hobby has a banged-up c-stick nub and a flaccid joystick that we need to get returned to its proper erect state unfortunately while the gamecube has great joysticks it's nearly impossible to prepare the internals of the stick box so when they break they must be replaced there are three main types of stick boxes that you might find in your controller and depending on the version you have the job of desoldering them could be a little more difficult this metal cover here means that ours is either a first or second generation unit so it means that heat will spread away faster from the soldering iron the good news is that generations one and two are interoperable so that gives us a few more options for sourcing a replacement the bad news is that while there are lots of new stick boxes available on amazon aliexpress and ebay they will likely make your precious first-party controller feel like an off-brand like circa or old school and those can be had for about 10 brand new so the easiest way to obtain a good replacement is by salvaging one from another gamecube controller or a wii accessory like the nunchuck though it should be noted i'm using the term easiest rather loosely here the gamecube controller is a much more involved teardown than the snes controller starting with nintendo's trademark tri-wing screws you will need an ifixit kit or similar in order to get these puppies out and ending with the desoldering that we're going to have to do to get our donor joystick and c-stick out of this bad boy [Music] off comes the joystick cover on the c-stick we're going to hold on to that for taren's controller for later now to get the c-stick out on some versions this is soldered but conveniently on ours it's a socketed plug so we can just pop this off and out comes the soldering iron [Music] that's it for our donor controller for now but we're going to hold on to it for when we inevitably need that second joystick down the road our second operation here is to replace the stick covers and here again we could just purchase new ones online but again many of the cheap options online don't quite measure up to the originals and our customer is particular thankfully our broken controller happens to have all the right working parts to fill in the less working parts of terence now to open up teren's controller and this time we need to go deeper into our disassembly of the rumble pack by fully desoldering it this is going to give us the access we need to the back of the stick box [Music] and once again it looks like this controller has been spilled down check this out we've got the stick box out and this thing looks freaking rusty what is even going on here ultimately that's probably not what made it loose like this but it certainly didn't help taran's c-stick box is in acceptable condition so all we need to do is put the new cover on top of it reassemble and it's time to test and woohoo not brand new type but hey it didn't come from a brand new controller so what do you want gamecube controllers particularly the joysticks are a rabbit hole and a half to go down so in the interest of time i would suggest that instead of listening to me talk about it you check out places like ssb wiki gc controller library or pretty much anywhere that smash bros players tend to congregate let's do something a little easier next where'd it go ah here it is this playstation 3 controller is from our cameraman andy hi andy it still works perfectly fine except whoops the built-in lithium battery is toast one solution that i pitched to him would be to switch over to xbox like a proper chad no but andy didn't have any of that so i guess we'll replace his battery for him replacing a battery is mostly painless when the controller is easy to open and this one is just unscrew the back phillips head screws thank you sony and lift forward toward the trigger buttons if your l2 and r2 fall out put them back on right away and make sure the little spring is on the inside of the trigger otherwise you're gonna have a pretty sloppy trigger now it's time to unplug the battery it might be a little tight but if you use a pointy plastic tool like this you'll be able to get a little bit more leverage and you should be able to push it out if you keep trying now one of the challenges when it comes to replacing batteries well in any device not just a ps3 controller is that due to a lack of right to repair legislation official first party replacements either do not exist or they're not sold for very long and it's a long way down the road that usually is when we need these things purchasing third-party batteries is absolutely an option but it can be a gamble since shady sellers can claim that a battery holds far more charge than it actually does and in an even worse case they might make mistakes in the production of the product for example it's pretty common with the ps3 to have the polarity flipped on the battery so make sure that the black wire is actually going to ground to avoid frying your controller or potentially turning the battery pack into a pretty spicy pillow when you insert the battery make sure the black and red wires are on the same side of the connector groove [Music] we'd recommend taping down the battery at this stage [Music] then once you've got the shell back together you're going to want to make sure that your triggers and your shoulder buttons are working correctly before you screw it back together so andy your controller is restored to battery life wow i can't play gta 5 here you go next up we've got what i'm going to call the little brother special it's a rock candy controller from pdp for the xbox 360. i have no idea why this holds such a special place in alex's heart but it does and given that xbox 360 controllers have been getting much more difficult to come by lately i feel it would be a service to the gaming community overall to fix this one up for him so that he doesn't have to go buy up one of the proper first party ones that the rest of us would rather use from talking to alex we know that the problem with this controller is that it will intermittently disconnect which can be anything from corrosion on the contacts inside the usb-a connector to a partial break in the cable to some kind of loosening of the connection even here inside the controller now because it would take us a long time to diagnose which of those particular problems this is what we're going to do is we're just going to strip down the controller and solder on a completely fresh usb cable we start by unscrewing the shell and lifting up the back avoiding the triggers just like the ps3 then looking closer at the pcb there's what seems to be an oscillator here that's either glued down which would be fine or has some kind of schmoo or leaking thing coming out of it which could be causing our connectivity problem we think it's more likely to be the usb cable so we're going to go straight to that fix we'll need to take the board out and remove the joystick covers just like we did on the gamecube and at this stage we need to note the order of our usb wires if the board is labeled black is ground red is voltage green is negative data white is positive data and this will all be relevant later we can desolder the wires from the board with a soldering iron or heat gun however it works for you then it's time to put the controller aside for a minute and find a donor cable i'm feeling more like a classic black yeah now we strip it tin it and solder it remembering the order what you're looking at now is us doing it backwards whoops so we'll need to do that again [Music] if your original cable had some kind of strain reliever or rubber grommet to hold it in place make sure you dissect that wrap it around your new cable and reinstall it it can be the difference between years of trouble-free operation or it just immediately breaking again if you had better foresight than us by the way you could put some heat shrink around your cable and that would probably help it stay in place a bit better now we reassemble and return and no dropping in and out hey alex get your crappy controller back thank you i can finally play rocket league while i can we got pretty lucky on that one not every third party controller is easy to fix they often use different pcb layouts and or components that make finding replacement parts much more difficult also because they're less common the online resources for repairing them can be few and far between this ps2 controller from david is a perfect example we honestly had a hard time even getting the thing open let alone working on it without risking any additional damage so his makeshift solution to the dead spring in the right trigger might be the best that he can do for now bringing us finally to something a little bit more modern i've actually got a couple of broken xbox one controllers so let's see i'd say the broken micro usb charging part on this one is pretty minor and too similar to something that we've already done so why don't we do the one that doesn't power on at all i think this one ended up with some kind of coating all over the pcb as part of a previous video i actually don't remember all the details though step one is to pry up the handles hard got to get those off to get at the screw holes then there are five screws two on either side and one under the battery cover now pop off the front plate and it's time to unscrew all these tiny screws there's not actually a ton of them but don't miss any the rumble got disconnected at some point we're not sure what happened there and this conformal coating ah yes this was from bathtub gaming it's clearly coming off but the weird thing is we're getting continuity on it and yet it simply doesn't work i don't know how much additional time we're going to be investing into this one especially when we've got more important things to talk about we actually didn't get any modern controllers with dead joysticks but given how common stick drift is i feel like it's at least worth talking about there are a handful of joystick technologies that have made their way into consumer controllers the sega dreamcast used hall effect sensors essentially magnetic joysticks and the notorious n64 joystick actually used an optical sensor so despite flopping around due to a defect in the mechanical design the accuracy almost never degraded it's one of the few stick boxes by the way that can actually be repaired by disassembling and refurbishing it the writer for this video is on probation so he didn't make it into the youtube video this is his controller that he wanted to get fixed but maybe we'll have him do it as a float plane exclusive when we're done sign up on floatplane.com unfortunately no modern joystick uses either an optical or hall effect sensor nintendo sony microsoft and even media darling valve all use potentiometer joysticks which well are inherently fragile a potentiometer is a variable resistor that restricts the flow of electricity each joystick then has two potentiometers one for up and down one for left and right so moving it around changes the voltage values that are being reported to the console on both of those axes a spring returns the stick to center the issue with potentiometers is that they involve two pieces of conductive material rubbing together if those two pieces start to wear out warp or they get dirty well it's possible that they will output a value that corresponds to this rather than to this causing the input from the stick to drift a little even if physically it's in the right position potentiometers are used because they are cheap and really for very few other reasons it's kind of wild that in 2002 we have more expensive controllers that use worse technology than what we had back in 1999. some companies though like bully kit are working on aftermarket hall effect sensors for the steam deck and switch and maybe other controllers in the future to finally solve a problem that shouldn't have existed in the first place the script says until we have hands on we can't speak to the quality of their solution but i actually tried the steam deck one today right before i came over here and it is better especially with the steam deck where you can configure the dead zones no dead zones oh so fine anyway this was a lot of fun so if you're looking to get more mileage out of a controller you already own or if you want to score a deal on a controller by fixing it up yourself or maybe you even want to start a new hobby or side business fixing and flipping old controllers i'd say it's worth giving it a try just be careful where you get your controllers from japan is a good source and is actually where this pile of super famicom controllers came from they belong to the writer who worked on this project if you run into export woes though there are lots of as-is controllers on sites like ebay just be careful because if they're coming from other refurbishers as this one likely is i mean who else would strip off the battery covers then you have no way of knowing if earnest efforts have already been made to fix them they could be just irreparably broken this one on the other hand looks a lot more like someone decluttering their garage and could be a prime candidate for some fixing do you know who's a prime candidate to sponsor this video though freshbooks when
