free code camp i put that right at the beginning because i'm like this is always gonna be free i want people to know it's free you know free code camp like it's the community for uh busy adults essentially most of them are working full time a lot of them have kids mortgages what we do is we break everything up into extremely bite-sized little chunks where you can hop on and productively code information is infinitely reproducible there's no reason that we have to charge money for information i feel like if you if you're blessed with abundance you have a duty should you choose to hear keep the call to go out and try to help other people welcome to coffeezilla another edition of the sunday special today we have a very exciting episode got the lambo in the back because we're talking about knowledge okay today we have quincy larson the founder of free code camp and i'm here to talk to you guys it's a positive episode quincy thanks for coming hey thanks for having me man quincy first tell me about your background your site free code camp is a place where anyone can get a programming education for free right yep that's right no strings attached no uh no backdoor agreements actually for free yeah you just have to put in the time which is a big ask for a lot of people but yeah that's amazing like first of all uh i believe in this model of education as sort of the way of the future how many kids though actually have or it's probably not just kids i'm sure it's a lot of adults also trying to continue their education how many people have gone through this yeah so we have about 40 000 people who have finished free code camp and gone and gotten a job as a software engineer 40 000. uh and those people haven't paid a dime they just sat down and grinded really hard for like several years in most cases and and there are some kids nobody under 13 please don't use our site it's illegal uh according to kappa so if we find out you're under 13 we have to delete your account but but the average like the median age of people who use free cooking closer to 30 um 31. wow so it is a lot a lot of adults uh trying to kind of future proof themselves i mean i think it's no secret that the world is going to a more tech code-centered world and even knowing some code even if you don't want to be a software developer can be extremely useful at your job anywhere you really are uh is the goal of most people to pivot away to a new education is it to give themselves like a better life i mean what what's kind of what you hear from the community yeah absolutely so the people who use free cocaine generally like they already are working in some capacity because it's it's the community for uh busy adults essentially most of them are working full-time a lot of them have kids mortgages you know maybe elderly uh parents and relatives they're taken care of uh or people with disabilities you know they're busy they don't have a lot of time and what we do is we break everything up into extremely bite-sized little chunks where you can hop on and you know productively code maybe 30 minutes a day i i can like preach about this all day but basically you want to take time you want to take a few years to learn all this knowledge it's a lot uh if you try to like drink from the proverbial fire hose you're going to find yourself without a lot of face so i would definitely recommend just taking it easy and planning to stay in school stay at your job don't do anything dramatic or risky and just gradually you know expand your skills and transition into a more technical role that for some people that could be becoming a full-blown software engineer for some people that could be becoming a full-blown data scientist for a lot of people that just means being more effective in their you know uh accounting practice or their you know marketing consultancy or whatever it is they're doing like you can use code so many different ways you can make your life so much easier just by automating the tedious parts of your job and being able to focus on you know the dynamic stuff that actually involves thinking i love this so i don't know how much you know about coffeezilla but we're more focused on like a lot of scams um and often times people go oh well what can i rely on is like an uh like a resource or an educational thing and i can happily recommend things that are uh free but i think as you said it's important to like note that any kind of worthwhile thing education otherwise job prospect it takes time and i appreciate you saying that it takes like multiple years is that usually what you guys find like two to three years to go through i mean the fastest somebody who's completed our curriculum which is about you know two thousand hours worth of coursework uh this this very uh ambitious uh he's already a you know professional software engineer he went through our curriculum but basically his review and still took him 29 days basically speed running it all day yeah he speed ran the free cocaine curriculum in 29 days so it's it's a lot to take in and you know i mean it when i say like don't expect to be a developer in like nine months even if you were to go to like one of these intensive coding bootcamps like you're gonna spend a whole lot of time preparing for that and or you're gonna not really get a lot out of it because you have to have a strong baseline knowledge if you're going to try to gear up and learn intensively and then what they often don't tell you is it takes months and months and months of job search to get a job like a perfect example if you if you google coding bootcamps you'll find like this article by somebody freco camp community who wrote about like he went to berkeley he already had like i think like an undergraduate engineering degree from berkeley and he went to the most i guess prestigious coding boot camp at the time 2016-ish and he still had to apply to hundreds of jobs in order to get satisfactory job offers and he ultimately did get like six job offers and some were really good but it took him months and months and a lot of it wasn't just like a you know applied to five jobs a day it was like that was his full-time job so there are tons of opportunities there are hundreds of thousands of open positions for software engineers around the world but people are very risk-averse when they hire because it you know it's one bad software engineer can do a lot of damage to a code base and a lot of them should the more relevant organization quincy i think something that like you sort of represent is the open source paradigm open internet free internet versus you know uh also another very popular model which is the paid paypal like the for-profit model can you give me your explanation as to why you made free code camp uh free i mean it is kind of counterintuitive why not make money from the thing uh you can make a lot more of it yeah yeah so this is probably gonna be a long answer there's this famous uh speech uh from stuart brand uh creator of the whole earth catalog big inspiration to both uh you know steve jobs and steve wozniak uh early days you know palo alto he said information wants to be free and everybody hears that everybody's heard that expression information wants to be free but what he said immediately afterward he said and it also wants to be very expensive because the right information in the right place can totally change your life and i i feel like wow that's brilliant i internalize the information wants to be free and everybody else internalized the last half of that which is much more menacing you know so uh for me like it was never a question like i put free at the beginning of free code camp i'm gonna try not to spill you know t on my laptop there but free code camp i put that right at the beginning because i'm like this is always gonna be free i want people to know it's free i don't want people to think it's like some bait and switch right because it's like that value is very important to me like i grew up hearing information wants to be free and feeling that and to some extent living that um and i you know i just spent my days in the library like reading books and and uh you know living the kind of bohemian lifestyle of just like crashing on a mattress on the floor and then getting up and going back to the library and uh for me i met tons of people in california when i moved out to california uh santa barbara area just tons of people that that didn't really care about money that much i mean granted it's a relatively wealthy place so it's easy to not care about money when you know you don't have to worry about freezing to death during the winter and you don't have to worry about like uh you know other things that people have to worry about right uh it's a very privileged part of the united states uh but i i hung out there and i was just really impressed that like these people could just like conjure money from thin air i had a friend who was just he had like a six core pc that was doing nothing but mining bitcoin all throughout 2012 2013. it's a good time to mine yeah that was a very good time to mine and he didn't care like like this guy was the most uh aesthetic person i'd ever met right like like he had this cheap little netbook that he posted on because it was lightweight and he could carry it and uh he just wore the same clothes every day and like you go to his room and all it is is a desk that he put his laptop on and a bed and he lived with this uh this quadriplegic guy who was tragically injured during a um during a uh like just a a pool accident he dove into shallow water and you in his entire life use water pollution but he lived with them because they would give him a hundred bucks a month and uh just let him live there for free if he if he kind of helped out around the house because people who require please have lots of needs and i was just incredibly inspired by that guy like he took the bus he didn't drive uh you know he didn't really spend any money at all he ate the exact same meals he would go to subway and he had this exact same extremely healthy like sandwich that he had prepared with like grilled chicken and all the vegetables and a little bit of olive oil and stuff and that's like for him life was very simple it was like the closest you can get to like a life of mind that you imagine like socrates or confucius right and that for me he was such a huge inspiration for me and that like at the time i was you know like the typical middle class middle manager in a large you know japanese corporation basically running like a school and i've been a teacher and a school director for the past 10 years and done that in the us and china and all the stuff and i've seen like how i haven't lived in china for six years just seeing how little people live with um going out into the countryside and and seeing people who like they would just play mahjong and then they go back to the rice fields and that was their life right um that was their life they had like this kind of shared war that they lived in yeah and uh you know the migrant workers and everybody and and for me it was just like wow if they can make do with all that and like here i am like you know with like a suit and like my own nice air-conditioned office and all this stuff and i'm not gonna say it was like a like a you know go to india type moment and like walk around barefoot like steve jobs experience or anything like that but or jack dorsey is trying to live out every day yeah yeah the difference is steve jobs wasn't like a billionaire who was you know with a nose ring when he did it i'm sorry i don't want to rip too much on jack dorsey at least he banned that one guy but um yeah for me free is is a state of mind like if i feel like if you if you're blessed with abundance to the extent that you know most middle class americans are whether they want to acknowledge it or not to some extent like you have a duty should you choose to hear keep the call to go out and try to help other people and the fact that i think is probably the most important single fact that defines my life is the knowledge that about sixty percent of people on earth live off like five dollars and fifty cents a day just imagine that for a second and there might be somebody who are watching some people who are watching this who are in that demographic because youtube fortunately is free and you can if you have a smartphone which most people do you can watch things on youtube it's staggering to think about like a lot of people spend more than that on their phone bill each month right and yet people are living off of that and people don't necessarily have credit cards they're unbanked if you put even like a dollar you know pay wall on your website it it shuts people out absolutely so yeah for me it was very important that if we wanted to have like true accessibility in the socioeconomic sense of the word then we needed to make sure that everything was free and nothing was pay walled and to this day like i refused to put any sort of premium you know behind the paywall content on freecodecamp like we actually had a big falling out with uh medium because they wanted us to put stuff behind a paywall and we were refused and we it was very costly but we were able to move all of our publication off of medium as a result of that and and uh yeah it's important free is uh for me it's it's the most powerful word free and and we all want to be free and we want to be free from want and and part of that is um being able to get what we need and what we need so much of in this life is just basic knowledge to be able to earn what we need to be able to provide for our families and to be able to sustain ourselves and our communities and you know once once prosperity's totally gone once you have like a true failed state like somalia things get very bad very quickly and i don't want to see any society fall into that and we don't it doesn't have to information is infinitely reproducible there's no reason that we have to charge money for information you know mit put their entire curriculum out in like the turn of the century right like the entire mit curriculum opened courseware you could just go and learn from the best engineering school perhaps in human history that is really mind-blowing but one of the things the nature of online education has really transformed also even the value proposition from needing to be i mean at at one point you needed to pay teachers to constantly be showing up again and again and again nowadays the cost of producing education has lowered actually and so the fact that we see increasing college costs i guess i don't rant against this enough that's a crime the fact that we see increasing um all these like paid courses and stuff it's like no actually education's va like value it's not that it's value-less but the ability to produce it at scale has ma has exploded with the internet with the rise of online video now you don't have to have the same teacher show up every year you can record their best performance you can get the best teacher on earth to show up teach one time and then show it to millions of people so that is even a better case for what you're saying um when you look at the coding experience i mean what was your background going through it because surely it wasn't free code camp did not exist when you got started what what's your educational background and yeah um were you the kind of first to market on this as far as the free code camp stuff yeah so um i'll just give you a very high level overview so i i did go to i dropped out of high school as a sophomore like lived in my car for a year or two and just worked at taco bell and at some point i was like man i i do not want to be doing this for the rest of my life and i'm grateful that that happened you know pre-covered because i would have been screwed like working it like talk i almost certainly would have caught it and uh been you know one of the millions of americans who lost their job or had other hardships as a result so it's on the timing right like definitely survivorship bias was in my favor um but uh yeah so i did that and eventually i went back to like state schools uh the very same state cool schools that you know our president joe biden went to um that he's pushing for essentially free community college that's the kind of education i got and it was very powerful because uh i got to learn what i needed to learn and this is gonna probably you know spur some ire some envy but i only paid like a thousand dollars a semester to attend it was very inexpensive in oklahoma city where i grew up uh and then i had the opportunity to go abroad and i did a graduate program in tianjin which is right outside of beijing and i did like an intensive chinese program i was the only uh the only white guy the only uh with the guy who was your grad on campus what was your graduate what'd you study in graduate school i did an mba oh sorry nba okay got it got it yeah so so i i do understand like basic economics and and it's interesting what you said about education and prices going up like if you look at like economic textbooks like like hayek not just the textbooks but the actual economists like milton uh friedman uh you know for your kayak um you know uh keynes you look at those people and like they kind of almost just assumed that technology was gonna continue to drive prices down it's weird that prices are going up for anything really because technology is supposed to make things cheaper that's what it does it makes widgets it makes the manufacturing of which is more effective it makes the delivery of service more effective and it has made it more effective it had like it has made it easier to produce but there are obviously what the saying that you said earlier has held true that information wants to be free it also wants to be really expensive because people come around in my experience and say hey you're going to get like our paywall will give you access to some magical secret and there is something very enticing about that where people humans kind of naturally assume well if it's expensive it must be quality right if it's expensive it must have some secret that justifies its magical pricing what you actually find out is there isn't such an easy correlation as you might assume because as you said like literally mit's course where it's online for free yeah there's there's you know like demand curves if you look at demand curves traditionally you know supply and demand price goes down right yeah uh where the two meet right and uh what you can have is you can have upward sloping demand where like a luxury good for example because it's it's luxury it's got this halo and the more expensive it gets the more people want it like there's that iphone app that's like like i'm rich iphone app or whatever and you paid a thousand dollars you got this thing and it's just like this diamond that says you're rich and that was the app and people like tons of people paid for that you know it's wasteful that we have people that are so rich because they don't really appreciate it the marginal utility of having more than like eighty thousand dollars a hundred thousand dollars depending on how many kids you have in income a year it just rapidly drops off and you know if you meet a lot of you know multi-millionaires often they'll be you know miserable sons of they're not really that happy and yet if you took even a force from their wealth and transferred it to like the single mothers and all the other people that that are are basically uh in dire straits you could dramatically transform their lives but we don't do that because we you know the people get addicted to having this this number you know like nolan bushnell the creator of atari and chuck cheese um has this great quote he says business is a game you keep score with money and that's that's how it works like in their mind they just want to drive that number as high as possible it's irrational why whenever i meet somebody who's like a multi-millionaire i always ask them like so so why do you want to be rich and they they look at me incredulously but if they actually think about it and try to give me an answer it's usually just to minimize downside risk to get like health insurance and like oh if i have cancer i'll be able to afford good treatments stuff like that yeah everybody in sweden gets that just for existing you know they just pay like a slightly higher marginal tax rate and they have health care they have good education that doesn't cost an arm and a leg you know coming out of business school i was very much into thinking like oh you know like america's got a lot of things figured out um you know there's you know capitalism is really effective it's the market mechanism is really powerful and the more i kind of like grew older and like read more and more about economics the more i came to realize like you know there are certain sectors where the market mechanisms can corrupt things more than they can help and education and healthcare are two of those sectors you know i'm i'm definitely like a defender of capitalism and i think that like a lot of the innovation that's come out has been because we've had you know globalization and uh capitalism and like you know different organizations competing for consumer dollars and competing for you know government funding things like that right but um it really falls apart when you look at the american healthcare system when you look at the american education system like uh i know so many people who've gone to serve overseas in the military who come back and they've got this gi bill and they got suckered into some horrible for-profit university boom this is javier's gone they've got a worthless degree and some you know betsy devos has got an extra yacht the the for-profit school system is yeah it's really bad and and it is interesting how uh forces that can be very good can also kind of work completely in the opposite direction um let's talk about i mean how this intersects with what you do every day because obviously you live breathe kind of like this code camp and obviously there are a lot of different people popping up obviously tech is the hot thing it's been the hot thing for a long time it looks to be the hot thing for a very long time in the future how do you see yourself within um the market obviously there are people i talked about um well i've let's just say i've talked about a coding camp in the past who was you know charging a lot of money telling parents they need they pay this premium their kid will get you know a a super job somewhere at google or whatever how does that work here can you make a case for why that uh is valuable is not valuable etc yeah yeah well um a lot of it's just a big sales job you know uh one thing to do is go on google adwords create like a google adwords account um and just look at how much it costs to bid for you know university degree like certain keywords like bachelor's degree in nursing or a graduate degree or coding bootcamp that's another one that like if you search uh for for coding bootcamp you're gonna get like potentially three or four ads on top of your google results because uh if you have to advertise a whole lot for something that does say something in my opinion you know uh people have to advertise like tide for going and washing their clothes right because it's boring and people are like you know but if something's truly compelling there's a question about how much you really need to advertise for it um and a lot of as you you know trader joe's i've learned more from trader joe's and i've learned from looking a lot of tech companies uh about like just hi that's really interesting why why is that i mean they just care about quality and they they don't waste money or waste money and they don't plow money into the diminishing returns things like advertising advertising is diminishing returns like like at some point it it ceases to make sense to plow more money into advertising because you're your you know lifetime value of uh quincy you've offended so many people in this interview already i thought you were before but now you really are advertising is diminishing returns explain yeah well uh at some point it does make sense it's rational to keep running google ads or facebook ads too to raise awareness of something but uh at some point you've kind of saturated the market or it's so competitive that your cost of acquiring a customer if i can remember the acronyms correct your cac which is like a cool archaic word for um so your cac is uh so high that it's the the um the expected value of getting somebody on your uh on your product is not worth it so uh but it's surprisingly high like i remember a while back i was looking at like you know university of phoenix and uh other kind of online universities we're spending like 400 per click from google results think about that think about that so a university is before you've even joined they assume that a certain number of people who click through are not going to actually enroll so maybe twelve hundred sixteen hundred dollars they've spent just to get you kind of like enrolled in their program before they've actually even started spending money on teachers right and something to to know that all appears at the balance sheet of you paying for it you've got to pay for your own customer acquisition cost i mean that's always rolled into the price yeah somebody's got to pay there are no free lunches yeah no i mean but that means that the university of arizona a lot of the tuition fee maybe even university percentage uh yeah sorry what did i say you said university of arizona oh i'm sorry i'm sorry there's nothing wrong with the university of arizona i'm just sorry specifically calling out university of phoenix excuse me excuse me the university of phoenix uh a lot of your tuition is going straight to google or facebook or whatever adwords campaign they're running so so in the startup ecosystem it used to be back in the dot-com bubble that like yahoo was like this giant 100 billion dollar company and the reason was every single company that got funded would go and buy a big banner ad at the top of yahoo.com and that was a huge poor like their seed round maybe their series a was just going to yahoo and now your seed round your series a is going to two things one it's going to developers to build your product because the developers get paid one way or another right they're like they're the ultimate like pickaxes in the gold rush um and the other is advertising on google and facebook like that's 70 of online advertising right there just those two companies so google and facebook get really rich off of the venture capital kind of ecosystem which is constantly uh churning out startups that are going to spend a whole bunch of money advertising to try to get initial traction and find product market fit how much advertising have you done with free code campaign zero zero never not at google gave us 10 000 a month in free advertising and we just didn't even bother using it we used it for like a month or two but like it just stopped working because they asked for something else yeah whatever how many people are on your site daily you said absolutely that is mind-blowing that's such a great case study for like for you know building something that has a really strong value proposition you've done zero advertising and you have a recurring base of half a million students basically what are students how literally you just said it though right there is no such thing as a free lunch so how do you um obviously you're a non-profit but how do you like make money through donations i mean as soon as you get paid something yeah everything is donations so uh people when you know who graduate from free coconut often they'll turn around and like hey i just you know increase my earning potential by twenty thirty thousand dollars a year i mean sometimes it can be more extreme it's a lot better of an offer than the university thing i've got to say i was offended when i realized that my university texas a m was going to spend the next i don't know however long i live and probably well after i die amount of time now calling me and asking for more money after you've already made you know tens of thousands of dollars yeah so at least with you guys you guys it's on the back it's on the back and yeah i mean if and what we're interested we're not interested in large single you know one-time donations you can definitely do that we're actually doing a pleasure drive right now to create a data science curriculum uh wait i don't want to talk too much about that because i don't want to bore you with the details but if you want to help out we're building like a really elaborate like math and computer science and data science machine learning curriculum but uh that that's kind of like a pledge drive that's ongoing but uh in general we just like to have a broad coalition of grassroots support we'd much rather have like right now we have about seven thousand people who give us five dollars a month and i'd much rather have seven thousand people who give us five dollars a month than one person that gives us 35 000 a month or um you know ten people that give us three thousand five hundred dollars you know it just gets really brittle when you're relying on these rich people to support everything so it's and there's always a chance to have a stable budget yeah there's also we can make payroll and pay for servers yeah excuse me sorry it's also a much better chance that you get some weird conflicts of interest when you have one guy sustaining you or 10 guys because all of a sudden you're really beholden to those people whereas if you're beholden to a large like consumer base who actually uses the product that's a totally different um set of interests that you have to maintain because you're literally your mandate is to make the product better as it should be what is the i mean i saw this with khan academy i saw this video by uh sal khan i think is his name i'm a huge fan of his and it's because of the amount of people he's serving per the dollar that's actually spent on him i mean there's obviously this big push for what i don't forget what it's called like altruistic giving basically it's the idea that giving affected us yeah it has utility and like there's good ways to give there's kind of all giving is good but there's also dumb ways to give like less effective ways to give um do you know like how many dollars are spent a year per student served i think that's like a really interesting fact to think about so i calculate this and i publish it every year because we're re like i mean we're a 50163 donor supporting nonprofit same tax status as khan academy same tech status is like you know the red cross and doctors without borders um so we have to publicly disclose all this stuff including my income if you're curious how much does it make you can go check um so uh what we do is we put everything into what's called a 990 and we do it but i also put out like an annual report every year and one of the things i do is i crunch the numbers of like how many uh minutes people use for eco camp uh and then how much money we spent what was our budget for the year right and last year i think it was close to 50 hours worth of learning for every dollar donated to free go game because we had two points uh we had one point 1.2 1.3 billion minutes of usage which translates to 2500 years so it's like going way back before jesus if we were to like go back in time that's the amount of time that people use free code camp last year um and and and the cool thing about that is that means that there are about 2 500 people using free code camp right now as you and i talk that's amazing that's it's such an effective use of money and one thing that um i struggle with is that a lot of the people who i talk about on my show the only reason they're educating i mean like yeah the incentives do kind of get perverse when you're like trying to become a millionaire by teaching people like get rich online but like this is so kind of refreshing talking to you because your whole point is how effectively can we literally teach kids per dollar and that's uh that's kind of amazing 50 hours per dollar i hope you guys are paying attention if you're an a user of click funnels or something like that but that's that's completely insane i think it's interesting your job is to teach more people with less money and a for-profit education is to make more money per hour spent that's an interesting way to to think about it um and it's not just for-profit education like like there are ton there's tons of room for uh improvement in systems and this isn't i don't blame individual people usually for the state of like say the u.s education system but to give you some some quick concrete numbers i think most people on this call have most people watching this uh have uh probably gone to school at some point and and like if you went to school in america in the united states every year that you went to school it cost about ten thousand dollars now in new york city it's a lot more than that but like on average that's the median that america spends per student purchase and we're not talking about college we're talking about we're talking about like k through 12 yeah like like sixth grade so let's say you have a sixth grade teacher and she has a class of you know 40 people yep that means that her class is essentially 400 000 a year is allocated to teaching those people in her class does she get paid 400 000 a year no no no no no i know a lot of great teachers who deserve uh deserve a lot more money but they get paid yeah pittance there's in you know you could argue they should be paid certainly a lot more than they are but why why is it why are we spending so much money on education and there's just like this waste exhaust i feel like a lot of people would say that the quality of education is also lacking so not only is the cost of education extremely high but the quality of education is also um you might say really questionable yeah can technology change that i don't think technology alone can like completely transform it for everybody and we're seeing the limits of technology at least with the imagination that our current like educators and administrators i mean just to be clear like i don't think that the teachers are responsible for a lot of the the deficiencies in american like performance on like for example the standardized tests like like we get our asses kicked if you compare us like singapore or or shanghai which was like for some reason its own they didn't test everybody in china oh yes but like all these different countries like like we're pretty low for all the oecd countries right right and yet we spend probably more than most countries do most wealthy countries on education the education problem is i didn't mean to simplify it my mom's a teacher and her hands are often tied by the administration um so yeah i want to make that really clear yeah so just to be 100 clear like i'm just saying systems these are problems with systems administration like why do we have schools why are classes the same like the link that they are what do we have 12 grades and the only way to advance to the next grade is turn a year older like there's so there's so much irrationality like like we really need to look at the we need to return to first principles and figure out why is education the way it is you know sao khan actually whom you mentioned earlier has a book called one world schoolhouse uh where he talks about a lot of these kind of notions um but for me i think that a lot of it is just like it's expensive to run a school and to air condition it and you know every school has to have a gym every school has to have a football team and like like pretty soon you've got all these non-academic related costs that just stack up and then how much is there actually left at the end of the year like the teachers are buying school supplies you know and can get a teacher discount so that they can take the school supplies provide them for their class because the school doesn't provide it when there's four hundred thousand dollars per class per year you know it's insane and and that's like i don't think the school systems pay taxes or anything either so that's like it's like after tax you know it's it's ridiculous um so yeah i i don't want to sound like i'm just knocking like american uh k-12 education universities sort of truism at this point among most uh people who've been through the educational system in the past 50 years uh everyone sort of experienced a very sort of similar experience i i don't think many people would consider it knocking it as much as you're just sort of stating the fact of the the situation what i'm trying to say though to answer your original question sorry for this response uh is technology is not some panacea that's just gonna make all our troubles go away oh technology just just increase the technology budget and no because those those administrators are gonna go out and get really crappy erp systems um and like yeah different database tools from like oracle or some you know corporation that like builds people books governments books institutions uh big enterprise sales person is going to take the cio to golf and they're gonna and the money's not gonna be well spent so the answer is not to empower organizations at the top to make big sweeping technological choices because uh that we've seen where that goes um and you can walk on walk into any university system and look at like their you know go in go back there look at what the university admins what tools are they working with i know at like university of california santa barbara i had a friend who was a prof there and he said that in the admin like they like every computer on the campus had netscape navigator 5 installed because there were systems that could only run using netscape navigator 5. they couldn't run anymore contemporary browsers and they were mission critical and i mean this is like one of the wealthiest public university systems in the world so the answer is to have the teachers themselves make a lot of the technology decisions and have kind of like this bottom-up percolation it's kind of like a dropbox model as opposed to box if you're familiar with the corporate you know equivalent of dropbox costs ten times as much right yeah yeah so you know it's it's basically like if everybody's like hey i'm using dropbox and you're using dropbox let's just get a team account right like problem solved for a fraction of what it would cost if you've got an oracle involved yeah so i think i think empowering the individual people with technology is what we need what we don't need is big broad sweeping like high level initiatives i think that's really important and it goes back to what seems like your fundamental philosophy on funding as well which is also more grassroots focused quincy i um talking to you i'm sort of struck because given obviously your website's you know extreme popularity um you're sort of i don't know if you look at yourself like this because you're you're sort of understated uh we've talked before but you're one of the front like you're one of the leaders of this like open education movement because you're a model of how this can you know work how do you see it going in the next 10 years for free code cap how do you see it going for the guy who's going to create the next free code camp yeah well i think open source is powerful you know there's there's that whole um that whole quote about like bill gates said that uh he and steve jobs like both had this wealthy neighbor uh over at xerox park and uh bill gates broke in to steal his tv only to discover that steve jobs had already broken in and stolen it first with the uh macintosh um you know i feel like to some extent like i'm just some random teacher who uh learned a little bit of programming skills and like wandered into this you know emporium of open source software and i was like the only customer in the entire thing and there were just people like hey try our software try our software it was amazing and uh you know free code camp like uh i basically just used tons of trapped together a bunch of open source libraries together and and got got things going and free code camp itself of course is open source and we use the very permissive bsd3 license and a lot of people use mit license there are less permissive open source uh licenses so they're not all the same you don't need a law degree to like parse the two but but generally if it's mit or if it's bsd uh you're probably good by the way uh but but yeah we i saw that i saw creative commons like books creative commons licensed courses all all these tools that we could use and we managed to strap together tons of different tools into like a full-fledged learning curriculum and uh you know a community like our forum software right that's open source uh the internet radio station code radio that's running on my friend uh his his tool called azuracast that's basically just like a free open source internet radio station you pay like 15 bucks a month and you can like host your own internet radio right um same thing with chat there's this this company out of brazil called rocket chat it's basically like self-hosted slack that's open source we paid nothing except for the server and we've got like our own enterprise level self-hosted slack that doesn't leak any data out to like salesforce or any of these other companies right it's just like ours you can own the future and most of it is free you just go grab it and code is infinitely reproducible so you just uh you spin up your own server and it it just blows my mind that like more people are turning to these big enterprise companies for solutions when so many solutions are open source and you can just like with a a little bit a little bit of technology acumen and a lot of curiosity you can very quickly build your own system and i am confident that there's not going to be like a next free code camper say it's going to be thousands of little free code camps it's gonna be the equivalent of like like cleveland is gonna have its own like some enterprising teachers are gonna put together this uh this system that like all the teachers band together and at some point it's gonna it's not gonna make sense to have individual schools or individual like i see the future of education as just a bunch of strip malls somebody rents a a room like a shop on that strip mall and sets up some desks and maybe get some some old you know linux based lab computers and stuff and people just go there and they learn and it's like a community school where people teach one another this may sound like you know utopian and stuff but this happens like there are people doing this right now in india there are people doing this right now in nigeria and places where like they don't have the the wealth that we have to to keep this behemoth continuing to run the way the the current education industry works in the us so we're going to see all kinds of innovation and um i hope that free cocaine can be a part of it you know there are programs that take pre-co camp and put it on computer labs inside prisons so that people can learn valuable job skills while they're in prison when they can't access the internet you know you can run free cocaine completely entirely on your local area network so there's tremendous potential to take education and essentially federate it um and uh not have these big you know not not be beholden to these gatekeepers like the us federal government for example or like um you know specific uh school districts and things like that and in the u.s homeschool laws are extremely permissive and you could easily just create your own school so i i hope more people will do that you've convinced me now i want to add one context before we wrap up here because uh you're a very charismatic dude with a vision for education that a lot of people are going to find really resonant one interesting thing on my show is we have a series called real jobs we just talk to people about how they sort of found themselves in these places that they do because i'm a big believer that sort of you kind of you kind of find your your way and you kind of find jobs you may never have expected to find yourself in and that's okay it's actually a normal part of the human experience you probably never saw yourself as like the founder of this you know company uh educating so many kids connect the dots between so you're in japan sort of this administrator i feel like we got a picture of sort of who you were you're looking up to this bohemian guy who realized you know maybe materialism isn't totally uh the great answer you know once you survive past your your survival needs it becomes largely irrelevant so you're looking for sort of like this like maybe this like larger purpose or something how did you go from that middle manager and connect the dots all the way to free code camp sure well first of course i spent years learning the code and working as a software engineer and doing freelance jobs and stuff which was interesting because i was 31 when i learned to code and a lot of people like assume oh i'm not some you know 23 year old stanford grad i can't learn to code uh and i'm actually like this is such a i guess endemic misconception that i had to create i created an entire hashtag right there's like a giant twitter list if you search dev after 30. um and i wrote like a big article where i like show some of the experiences of these people but a lot of people think like oh i'm set like my brain is like you know in this mold and it's jello and it's not gonna move around it's already dried right like that is the most uh i guess limiting way that you can look at your personal development the reality is like i during the pandemic i started playing bass right and like i started like learning like slap bass and like uh memorizing the fretboard and and just playing tons of awesome like police songs from the 70s and the clash and stuff like that right so uh i'm 40 years old right like i'm sure plenty of people would see like oh well you you know you always hear like the first thing you hear when you read about a musician he started playing piano when he's four right it's it's a joke like i think adults can learn way better than kids i have two young kids i try to teach them all the time listen i'm a big believer in this i think adults are limited by time but actually your ability to even understand the meta skill of learning increases with age and so yeah and there is like there is some truth to that where you can if if an adult is serious enough and they're willing to take on that beginner's mindset they can learn a lot i i taught myself piano and i really never got started i took lessons as a kid i hated it eventually i sort of got started when i was like i don't know 12 13 but even i got much better when i actually became an adult and i actually was sort of like enjoying playing et cetera but i had the exact experience i was like yeah this i don't know i i agree i agree 100 agree i think it's interesting that you're a case study for your own product though that you're not i assume talking to you that you were some stanford grad or whatever i mean you said you're a state school but i assumed sort of oh you had to have had a background so interesting to me that you are exactly in that demographic that your own product teaches yeah i mean i was know this about you i was 31 years old and that's when i created freako camp and and got people involved and and i was able to like you know the best the best mascot i guess the best spokesman is somebody who is not just a member but product of the client yeah it's true though yeah yeah like like i'm i'm basically applying my hard-won wisdom about what does work and what doesn't work and i went down tons of blind alex man like i spent i spent years like banging my head like thinking i was an imposter if you look if you google like business insider quincy larson you know imposter syndrome something like that right like you'll find this business center like profiled me and my experiences with imposter syndrome working at uh you know a tech startup as a 30 year old you know guy who's on his first developer job i mean like i've lived that experience and i can kind of relate to people so i can tell you if you are watching this and you want to learn to code any sufficiently motivated person can learn to code you don't it has very little to do with iq or aptitude i mean if you believe in evolution and you believe that like humans originated in africa and that we were basically just running around like killing animals and like burning them and eating them and stuff and that was like our heritage you're gonna think like okay were there computers back then was there like abstract mathematics was like any of this stuff that software engineers use was it selected for over a hundred thousand years of evolution no you know like like the only difference that i can see is the kids who the rich kids who got a computer when they were young like the the mark zuckerbergs who by the way his parents like paid for him to have programming tutoring for like years and years before he got into harvard as a cs student by the way so like a lot of it is just like you know social economic privilege like many things right um so just because they act like programming is easy and everything you know the things that you learn when you're a kid you tend to forget how hard they were when you learn them absolutely so don't ever believe somebody when they say programming's easy or a program just came naturally to me you know when somebody says like that something like that i just immediately kind of say like well you've forgotten the beginner's mindset what we call an education the learner's mindset uh you have forgotten what it's like to be at the beginning and to see this giant see that you have to somehow swallow up and but you know it's the same way you do anything it's just like one step at a time one day after a day you know if you if you were to sit down and code 30 minutes a day every day for the next two or three years you would be a better potentially better programmer than a lot of the people who are out in the field you'd probably almost certainly be better off than people that like got a cs degree or um you know um went to an intensive program a coding bootcamp because you would have tons of practice and not just practice but like practice day after day uh and just that day like working on something for a little bit then going to sleep having all that etch into your brain and then waking up and starting where you were that process that is everything like forming the habits uh forming that muscle memory and one other thing i'll say uh that i think is very important it's a lonely process and you can definitely get daunted you can definitely feel insufficient uh everybody does everybody feels impostor syndrome i think but having a community hanging out with people that are also developers that was like my lifeline like i i knew that guy i knew the the the uh the guy who just mined bitcoin and like coded all day and like he was kind of my mentor and then i hung out with him and i hung out with a whole bunch of other place people at like this place called the santa barbara hackerspace and that was kind of like my community that was my tribe that i got pulled into they they took me in they took some some weird you know 30 year old dude in a suit they took him into their their you know uh software development club and treated me as one of their own in in that inclusiveness like that was definitely something that i wanted to build into free code camp as well it's just a sense of making people feel belong that's incredible i don't know how much i can i can add to that it's that's i you know what's funny is uh i rarely get spellbound by the people i'm interviewing story but i was like kind of like listening as if i was like an audience member there for a second um that's amazing i hope other people can find their tribe whether it be coding or anything in a space that prioritizes their learning in the same spirit uh that you do thanks quincy thanks for coming on thanks for coming on the show discussing all these things if you want to find them you can find them on twitter at quincy larson where else can people find you obviously they can go learn to code at free code camp yeah yeah just go to freecodecamp.org and uh take a look um and when you sign up you're gonna get like this little spiel from me that tells you like coding's hard like basically like trying to sell you and not using code camp and if you're still like yeah i should still use free cooking screw quincy i'm gonna do this you know then then that means it's meant to be so uh psychology good reverse psychology yeah give it a go and even if you don't end up using it it's still a valuable skill it's still fun and another thing just because you think you suck at math it just means that you didn't like it taught properly like you can definitely learn math uh and there's not that much math in a lot of development so don't feel like your lack of math skills is a prerequisite a lot more just critical thinking and reasoning and stuff is is kind of the operating thing you can use as a developer awesome thanks quincy thanks guys we'll see you tomorrow wake up and smell the coffee
