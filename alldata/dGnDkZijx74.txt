hello everyone and welcome in this video we are driving the brand new 2017 Honda Civic SI and as you can see I'm in the car with Carlos logo of Edmonds hi guys thanks for joining Carlos they pair us up but he was kind enough to uh let me ride with him he threatened me with violence so occasionally uh things got out of hand but for the most part we've kept things calm so let's talk some numbers first about this car uh 1.5 L first time you're going to have a turbocharged engine and a Honda Civic SI I believe I don't think they've ever done that from the factory have you know what the first turbocharged Honda product in the US was I don't know what that was a jet ski it was a jet ski personal watercraft if you want to get real inous about it a personal watercraft yeah the first Honda Jet Ski was turbocharged that was their first turbocharge offering in the US have they done it in the SI before uh no okay y so 200 that's all I wanted to know car you're you're right I just wanted to throw that in there a little bit of color 2005 horsepower which is the same as the previous generation SI but 192 lbet of torque which comes com on at 21 R 2100 RPM that's the advantage of the turbocharger now the torque does start to die as you get into the top end and the power does as well but you have a much medier mid-range than you did previously some of the other numbers this car weighs about 2,900 lb and that's regardless of if you get the four-door or the twodo they actually weigh within 17 lbs of each other so really cool and the pricing is the exact same CA sedan so you can pay 239 uh or you can pay 241 for a set of su tires uh plus then you're going to have to add in the shipping and handling basically you're getting into this for less than 25 Grand all set and done and that's the only trim that there is you choose Cooper sedan based on whether or not you actually want to put someone in the back seat and if you don't you can just get the coupe same price so it's cool that they're only differentiated really in price performance- wise uh extremely similar weight balance extremely similar so not a huge difference there you do have a helical uh limited slip diff up front um so you know rare for this price point for 24 Grand getting an LSD and you also have an Adaptive damper system um so you have two modes there normal or Sport and I'm going to just go to me on a whiteboard cuz that's going to be easier than trying to explain with my hands how these work so very quickly there are two major modes here normal and Sport and what these modes do is they change the range of damping force that you have and so on the left here we have our damping Force that's this axis and then this axis is our stroke speed so up top we have rebound when the uh shock is expanding and then on the bottom we have compression when that damper is being squeezed together and so what happens the the difference that happens is based on the stroke speed in normal mode you have this range of allowable damping force that can change depending on the circumstances in sport mode you're going to increase that minimum damping force uh so you're going to have more damping Force overall same thing with the compression side so how does it determine where in this range how much damping Force it's going to apply well let's look at this example here which can kind of illustrate it this is an exaggerated example so we've got these very large bumps this is going to be happening at a much smaller scale at a much more faster Pace where it's going to be making these adjustments and it makes those adjustments by changing the amount of oil flow that's allowed in that damper so it can reduce the orice size and then increase the damping Force as a result so we have this vehicle traveling at 40 mph and it hits This Small Bump right here which has a specific slope and it's going to you know give that uh it's going to find it a rating based on the stroke speed and it'll be somewhere down in here now if you hit this larger bump which has the exact same slope but a higher amplitude it's going to increase the the damping force with that one and so once again this is going to be applied at a much you know more minute scale where it's going to be adapting to the road surface uh but overall what you're doing when you put it in sport mode is you're increasing that minimum damping Force great white section I like that section A lot it was really thank you I'm glad you enjoyed that you know just did it real quick on the side of the road out here in the studio that they have uh now onto the steering this is one of my few complaints um but surprisingly they have put a good amount of research into improving the steering one of the unique things they've done is they've separated the pinion that's electronically controlled from the one that's driver controlled so my hands are gripping the wheel there's a drive shaft or a shaft from the wheel to the rack that you're going to be moving back and forth and there's no electronic interference in that pathway that allows for you to get better feedback then separately on that rack there's a separate electric motor which attaches to the pinion elsewhere and that can assist uh more when you're in normal mode less when you're in sport mode and so what they say is that improves the feedback that you're going to get uh it does have a good steering ratio you know it doesn't require turning the wheel much and you do have a nice weight to it I'll give them that the one thing that that I don't really think it has is feedback uh it's an electronic power assisted system as I mentioned and you really don't feel too much of what's going on you know when you're at the limit the tires let you know the car lets you know you can feel it um and it's it's an easily approachable limit this is a lightweight car but I don't think the steering is what's telling you that hey you're at the limit you should kind of back off now it's very red it's super red very red yeah or super green depending on like really green that is like the greenest green I've ever seen and eco-friendly right I mean 38 actually yeah that's actually pry e 38 m per gallon is pretty solid yeah that's the highway rating 28 28 City uh the turbocharger can spool up to provide you 20 psi of boost we actually haven't seen it we've been flooring it and it reads a peak of 16 to 17 PSI not sure why it is super hot it's 96Â° out right now um I'm not sure if that has to do with it but it we haven't seen the peak 20 psi uh but that's the claim It's Tricky converting from metric but it says PSI right there oh well then I'm wrong uh as far as the Shifting the shifter feel itself is good they've reduced the amount of travel versus the previous generation and they've stiffened up some of the components required in that so it's got a nice crisp feel to it uh that said you do get a bit of rev hang so if you're you know you're flat out and you're at 5,000 RPM you're going you get up to 6,000 you let off the gas pressing the clutch it'll either blip a little bit or it'll hang there for a while before dropping back down this is something I've noticed in modern Subaru as well um so not sure quite the reason Carlos believes it has to do with emissions control um basically the uh engineer confirmed it okay he did okay yeah missions control strategy so something with letting that throttle close too quickly uh can cause poor emissions so that's that's the reason it's done uh it is unfortunate because if you want a really quick smooth shift you don't get it because if you're on the gas yeah it blips up and then it drops when you let the clutch when you force it to I think the big disappointment there is that shifter is so much fun to rope quickly yeah that when you execute the shift and then you have to wait for the engine to drop and rev so you can shift smoothly and it's it's kind of frustrating but there are worse things right sure yeah and I mean overall what's really cool about this is is really the the price point that it comes in and what you get for that price point so $24,000 you've got adaptive damping which you're not going to get in anything for 24 Grand uh that's sporty like this you've also got that limited slip differential so you know if you're to compare to a GTI uh the GTI is going to weigh more the base version is going to be about $1,500 more and you're not going to get uh adaptive damping you're not going to get a limited slip diff now you can in the GTI you go up to the performance package but then you're priced in the 2829 region um and this is just one straight you get all the amenities uh out of the box so it's got Apple carplay Android auto everything you would get in a Civic EX you'll get in this uh just one set price point it is unique in that this isn't a high revving Honda and it's a Honda Si which traditionally have been much higher revving and so you know coming from ns2000 as my daily driver and that kind of Honda Heritage of these Small high- reving Engines it's a different feel where you have torque earlier you don't in my S2000 you know you wait until you hit 7,000 RPM and then you start having some fun this you can start having fun at 3,000 RPM there definitely is noticeable lag for that boost to build up it's a small 1.5 L and it's cranking all the way to 20 psi uh but you're going to get planted a bit more because you've got more torque earlier on than the previous generation SI so there are pros and cons to it you're not going to have the immediate thrott response that you know that these vehicles have kind of been known for is having that immediate crisp throttle response uh from having those naturally aspirated High reving engines but you're going to get planted in your seat a bit better uh and from an aftermarket standpoint you know perhaps you're better able to tune this engine 20 psi is pretty high as is so I don't know how much more you're going to want to put into it uh but having it Factory turboed is going to mean there's going to be some chips out there to make that you know quick work and and change the mapping to your desire as far as handling you know it does stay pretty flat actually and this was something I got to take it out on a track and so you know we're Honda's proving Center and the car does stay remarkably flat and so when you put it in sport mode it increases the damping firmness and as a result you don't get quite as much body roll and that body roll is slower to initiate uh so it does seem to stay pretty flat they have upgraded the suspension from you know let's say the ex sport Civic so a beefier suspension you're going to have a little bit more uh stiffness in the suspension overall they do have some Type R Parts in it that are shared um so a flat ride which makes it fun for handling and it makes it a bit tossable because this is lightweight uh but it also to me feels pretty comfort-based in a way like it's not a raw sports car like you would get in for example Miata a BRZ where you know these are rear rear wheeel drive platforms I feel like the GTI and this are similar in that respect um because I also feel like the GTI is a bit more Comfort based than you know performance-based but it feels it's a comfortable Cruiser we've been driving this car for the past 2 hours I'm not sick of the seats I like the seats they've got good bolstering which is great for these tight Corners uh but I haven't grown sick of them in this car ride and so it does seem to have this Comfort I don't want to say compromise but it's a comfortable car uh and it and it doesn't have like a a super raw performance aspect to it that you may get in those older uh SI where you really ring out the engines and you have that immediate throttle response more torque uh definitely more comfortable far more amenities it's certainly capable so it it has been fun to drive and it was a blast to drive out on the track um I wasn't really you know I was clueless out there to be honest uh it was they Proving Ground so it's made to be very technical you've got these blind sharp Corners uh which I didn't predict and and as a result you know I kind of went around them crazily but have quite enjoyed it the value I think is the big story with this I mean 24,000 adaptive damping limited slip diff turbocharged engine uh pretty cool what you're able to get at the price and still have all you know the interior amenities that you would get in a top end uh Civic so Carlos thank you for joining me on this ride um do you have anything you'd like to say about Edmonds while you're in the car you guys should fantastic website and everybody can check it out and their YouTube channel youtube.com/ a link oh thank you keep watching engineering explain cuz it's a good show I like it a lot thanks Carlos and so with that thank you guys for watching questions or comments leave them
