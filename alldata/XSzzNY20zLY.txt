this episode is brought to you by brilliant of all the power sources available to man none has been as extraordinary in energy yield as nuclear fission in fact a single gram of fissile nuclear fuel in theory contains as much free energy as the gasoline contained within a small field tanker truck today over 400 civilian nuclear fission power plants operate globally producing an estimated 2700 terawatt hours per year or roughly 10 percent of global energy generation despite several high-profile accidents and the associated stigma of radiation from almost 70 years of operational history nuclear power has proven to be overall the safest power source available having the lowest fatality rate per unit of energy generated when compared to other energy sources early on in its development fission-based nuclear power research was enveloped in optimism it was seen as a potential source of cheap and near limitless power and while its initial use on large military vessels were successful as nuclear power expanded into commercial use large plants that required a massive support structure and personnel to operate were needed in order to make commercial nuclear fission power generation economically viable these reactors could take almost a decade to construct and bring online and by the 1980s new reactor proposals would be met with constant opposition with concerns related to nuclear accidents proliferation terrorism and radioactive waste disposal this led to a period of stagnation for new plant construction and overall development though by the early 2000s concerns over carbon dioxide emissions would bring about a renewed interest in nuclear power and with this came a myriad of developments that are aimed at improving the safety and sustainability of large-scale reactors however in recent years a new paradigm in how nuclear fission reactors are created and utilized is starting to gain momentum one that has the potential to spark a new age of cheaper safer and more flexible nuclear power to date almost all nuclear power reactors extract energy from the process of nuclear fission in this process a fissile nuclear fuel is bombarded with neutrons as the nucleus of the fuels atoms captures a neutron by the strong nuclear force it begins to deform resulting in the nucleus fragments exceeding the distances at which the strong nuclear force can hold the two groups of charged nucleons together this tug of war between the strong nuclear force and the electromagnetic force ends with the two fragments separating by the repulsive charge this in effect transmutes the original fuel atom into two or more smaller more stable atoms simultaneously as the forces that bind the fuel atom's nucleus are reconfigured during this process around 200 million electron volts of energy is released by comparison even the most energetic chemical oxidation reactions release only a few electron volts of energy it is this energy that is captured and converted to a usable form by a nuclear fission reactor for most fission reactors the isotopes uranium-233 uranium-235 or plutonium-239 are used as the nuclear fuel this is primarily due to their availability in large enough quantities as well as their ability to sustain a chain reaction as they emit neutrons themselves in the fission process these isotopes are also considered visible in that they can undergo fission under the bombardment of low kinetic energy free neutrons or thermal neutrons because fission reactions are primarily driven by bombardment establishing and regulating a sustained fission chain reaction becomes feasible through controlling the free neutron movement within a reactor this characteristic allows for fission reactors to be throttled making it well suited for electric power generation the first practical nuclear reactor was developed during the early 1950s by the us navy for propulsion on their new generation of submarines and aircraft carriers known as the s1w reactor it would see its first deployment on the uss nautilus in january 1954. the s1w was a relatively simple and compact design known as a pressurized water reactor this configuration uses ordinary water kept under pressure at around 160 atmospheres to transfer the heat generated by fission to a lower pressure secondary system that generates steam from this energy the steam is then used to drive turbines that can produce both propulsion and electricity the fuel used for the s1w was enriched uranium that contained about five percent uranium-235 at this loaf and enrichment neutrons would need to be slowed down in order to increase the probability of a fission event and sustain a chain reaction in pressurized water reactors the high pressure water is used to moderate neutron energy by letting them undergo multiple collisions with the light hydrogen atoms in the water causing them to lose kinetic energy in the process the water moderator also serves as a passive self-regulating mechanism as its ability to moderate neutron energy is reduced as it heats up and increased as it cools the fission chain reaction can also be throttled by introducing neutron absorbers into the reactor core this is typically accomplished by the use of neutron absorbing control rods that can be lowered or withdrawn or by the use of soluble neutron absorbers that are directly added to the high pressure water the success of these early pressurized water reactors in naval use would directly lead to their prevalence in civilian power generation to date pressurized water reactors constitute almost 70 percent of the world's nuclear power generation capacity and it still remains the reactor design of choice for nations operating nuclear-powered navies within a decade the two circuit designs of pressurized water reactors would be reduced to a single loop configuration with the introduction of boiling water reactors designed primarily with civilian power generation in mind a boiling water reactor directly produces steam by heating cooling water with the reactor core the steam is then directly used to drive a turbine after which it is cooled in a condenser and converted back to liquid water where it is then pumped back into the reactor core boiling water reactors still utilize water as the neutron moderator and chain reaction throttling via control rods or blades was also retained what made this switch to the two phase flow single loop cooling configuration of this design so appealing was its reduction in component complexity and operating pressure boiling water reactors generally operate at approximately one half of the water pressure of a typical pressure water reactor around 70 to 80 atmospheres this is predominantly maintained in order to increase the boiling point of water at the core to around celsius this lower operating pressure reduces the containment strength required of the reactor boiling water reactors also irradiate their containment structures far less than pressurized water reactors extending the usable life of the materials it's constructed from steels for example become brittle over time under neutron bombardment effectively reducing its useful lifespan as a pressure vessel boiling water reactors also eliminate the need for highly corrosive soluble neutron absorbers and their feeding systems that are part of many pressure water reactors the relative low cost simplicity and inherent safety of boiling water reactors have made them the nuclear power solution of choice for several nations becoming the second most popular reactor class globally generating 20 percent of all yearly nuclear power around the same time period another less popular but cheaper to build reactor configuration was being pioneered by the british called the gas-cooled reactor in gas-cooled reactors an inert gas is used to transfer heat from the reactor core to a heat exchanger where steam is generated and sent to turbines neutron moderation is accomplished by encasing the nuclear fuel in either graphite or heavy water because no liquid cooling is required gas cooled reactors can operate at higher temperatures making them more thermally efficient the effectiveness of how they moderate neutrons also permits the use of less enriched uranium with some reactors being able to operate purely on natural uranium though at the cost of faster fuel burn-up furthermore they are able to be refueled while remaining online while gas-cooled reactors generate less than three percent of total nuclear power annually their primary appeal is their high thermal efficiency compatibility with existing coal burning power generation equipment and the ability to run on lower grade uranium allowing countries to fabricate their own fuel without relying on international supplies of enriched uranium from the mid-1960s into the 1990s most nuclear reactors constructed have been a variant of either a pressure water reactor boiling water reactor or a gas cooled reactor this generation of reactors that establish nuclear power as a viable energy source are considered generation 2 reactors with generation 1 reactors being considered the first experimental endeavors into the technology in the past 20 years reactor designs have gone through evolutionary developments aimed at reducing cost and increasing the safety of generation 2 reactors these designs are considered generation 2 plus and generation 3 reactors and it was expected that they would reignite interest in nuclear power once again despite these advancements almost all nuclear reactors to date operate with separate mechanisms for fueling moderation and cooling they require large complexes that are carefully designed with consideration for power demand fueling operational logistics safety and security for the region they operate in their immense cost and construction time limits their deployment to large-scale near-decade-long projects currently the next generation of reactor technologies are being developed categorized as generation 4 reactors many of these designs operate at higher temperatures by using gases molten salts metals or water held in a supercritical state as a coolant dramatically increasing their thermal efficiency among these concepts are several proposed fast reactors fast reactors sustain their chain reaction with higher kinetic energy fast neutrons and do not require a neutron moderator however they do require relatively higher enriched nuclear fuels though many of the proposed fast reactor designs can be fueled by a wider range of fuel elements from the actinides group generation iv reactors also introduce new approaches to reactor fueling beyond rods of palletized uranium and plutonium molten salt and metal reactors for example can be designed to utilize nuclear fuels directly dissolved into their cooling medium while gas coil reactors are becoming the focus for the implementation of a novel fuel packaging configuration known as a pebble bed reactor pebble bed reactors are a unique design that are powered by spherical tennis ball sized fuel elements called pebbles the outer shell of these pebbles are composed of pyrolytic graphite which not only serves as a neutron moderator but also forms a structural containment shell around the fissile material that is twice as thermally conductive as copper immune to corrosive effects and can withstand high stresses and temperatures exceeding 2000 celsius what makes these pebbles so groundbreaking as a fueling technology is found within the graphite shell known as stri-structural isotropic or trisol fuel this unique fuel configuration is characterized as a micro fuel particle trisol fuel is an engineered particle that consists of a half millimeter sized fuel kernel of a uranium based fuel material coated with four layers of isotropic materials these layers are deposited through a technique barred from the semiconductor industry known as fluidized chemical vapor deposition these thin solid layers are composed of a 10 micron porous inner carbon layer that contains the fission reaction products a nuclear moderating and protective 40 micron pyrolytic carbon inner layer a 35 micron silicon carbide ceramic layer to contain high temperature fission products and add structure to the particle and another protective 40 micron pyrolytic carbon outer layer unlike other nuclear fuels trestle fuel is incredibly robust and resilient they can survive extreme thermal swings without cracking as well as the high pressures and temperatures of fission cooling systems because of this ruggedness they are capable of containing their nuclear fuel in even the most extreme predicted nuclear accident scenarios trisofeel was first developed in the mid-1960s as part of the united kingdom's dragon reactor project where they were used in conjunction with helium to form one of the first high temperature gas reactors or htgrs gas cooled reactors work especially well with tristalfield because of their ability to operate at high temperatures while remaining chemically inert when combined with trestle fuel they offer incomparable levels of nuclear containment several generation 4 tristal gas cooled reactors are even attempted to reach higher operating temperatures near 1600 degrees celsius in a configuration known as a very high temperature reactor or vhtr at these temperatures an unprecedented thermal efficiency as high as 50 percent is predicted to be possible in addition some of these designs are claimed to be passively safe and can maintain containment even under total system failure along with being more efficient and passively safer generation iv reactors are ideal for a new paradigm in reactor construction known as small modular reactors or smrs smrs are nuclear reactors of relatively small power generation capacity generally no larger than 300 megawatts they're designed with modularity in mind using factory fabrication techniques that take advantage of the economies of series production and short construction times while traditional reactors require long-term large-scale on-site construction smrs are designed to be manufactured off-site on an assembly line and transported to the site and installed they can be installed in multi-reactor banks to increase plant capacity and they offer the benefit of lower investment costs and increase safety through containment while no smr plants are currently in commercial operation due to the hurdles of the current regulatory environment their modular nature makes future plant size deployments of the technology far easier once a single module is approved for use in march 2020 the department of defense had awarded three teams bwx technologies westinghouse and x energy contracts to begin design work on a long sought after but never perfector technology a mobile nuclear reactor called project pele the program is designed around the two-year design maturation period where a generation iv reactor design will be adopted to small-scale mobile use within five years the program is expected to design build and demonstrate a fully operational micro-reactor that can produce between one and five megawatts these microreactors are intended to be transported into combat zones generating power for remote regions disaster areas and military bases they should be able to generate power within three days of delivery and be safely removed in as few as seven days therefore mobility and the ability to safely tolerate direct attack is key to their design requirements x-energy in particular has promoted tristal pebble bed technology as the ideal choice for such a rugged reactor design trisol pebbles are passively governed by negative feedback they starve the reaction of neutrons as the temperature rises independent of any active or mechanical control their high temperature resistance shell also mitigates the risk of fuel melting when exposed to catastrophically high heat the fuel kernel can also be made from uranium oxycarbide instead of traditional uranium oxide to reduce flammability in cases of particle rupture these characteristics keep the nuclear material contained and prevent runaway reactions even in hazardous environments the structure of the reactor is also simple in design the fuel is placed within a pressure vessel containing helium where it circulates heat through a steam generator located outside of the pressure vessel the helium is inert and does not irradiate easily making vessel rupture less hazardous the fuel pebbles can also easily be replaced and evacuated from the reactor without shutdown by dropping them through the reactor by gravity project pele is expected to serve as a pathfinder for the commercial adoption of small easily deployable smrs and mobile microreactor technologies providing new tools for disaster relief and critical infrastructure support in addition the full-scale deployment of 4th generation nuclear reactor technologies will have significant geopolitical implications for the united states while reducing the nation's emissions one of the surprising aspects of designing a nuclear power plant is the incredible attention to detail in the systematic logic of how they operate each system must not only interoperate elegantly to meet power demands but also be able to withstand a significant amount of failure while still maintaining safety with as little human interaction as possible evaluating logic is a critical part of design and it's fundamental to our
