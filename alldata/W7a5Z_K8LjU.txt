one of the aspects of this strange time is how the extremes start to meet and how certain discourses can be held in opposition within a very same team and then can also be held the two opposite discourses can be held within the team that they're supposedly opposing so what i want to do right now is that in the wake of the covid crisis as we're still going through it and it's still playing out politically i want to show you some post-modern strategies and how post-modern theorists and post-modern activists used the structure of viral infection to affect society they did this consciously they did this deliberately and so we're going to look at that and how it is very strange to see the the discourses flip one side and the other in this situation [Music] this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world one of the reasons why i am quite worried right now to see where things are going and this of course has been i've been sounding the alarm at different levels since i started speaking online obviously not doing it all the time because who wants to hear someone screech all the time but i haven't sounded the alarm at the danger that is ahead of us of noticing the extremes start to manifest themselves to notice the extremes of chaos and uh mixture and madness right up to the extremes of control and order and uh you know hyper naming the idea of completely identifying and controlling on the other side and so one of the fascinating and disturbing things that have happened in since world war ii is of course the rise of post-modern thought and post-modern action now i've talked about jacques de geada before and so i want to quote something from jacques de gea i'm going to go through two quotes one from jacques de geada and another from a more contemporary source on queer theory and we're going to look at how they use the image of infection and the virus to defend the way or to talk about the manner in which they wish to affect society so the quote from jacques comes from a series of interviews that he gave called positions all i have done is dominated by the thought of a virus which could be called a parasitology a virology the virus is in part a parasite that destroys that introduces disorder into communication even from the biological standpoint this is what happens with a virus it derails a mechanism of the communicational type it's coding and decoding on the other hand it is something that is neither living nor non-living the virus is not a microbe and if you follow these two threads that of a parasite which disrupts destination from the communicative point of view disrupting writing inscription and the coding and decoding of inscription and which on the other hand is neither alive nor dead you have the matrix of all that i have done since i began writing so what is going on here so jacques tries to show by emphasizing the exceptions by emphasizing the margin by emphasizing all these categories that i talked to you about in terms of the the in-between categories the monster the stranger and also the virus that is the virus the parasite is something which does not is not part of your original identity you would say but nonetheless is living on your body in a manner that is transforming the reality of your of your body and so the virus will infect you and will break down the manner in which your body communicates amongst its different elements and so that is what post-modernism is and if you understand that that's what post-modernism is and the post-modern strategy is you can understand why it emphasizes the things it does you can understand why why we have seen this glorification of the exception the glorification of the outsider the glorification of in-between identities of identities which neither fit one side or the other because by introducing this these monsters within discourse what it does is by pointing to the exception you can what you can do is you can put an exception in something and that exception will start to feed on the main body just like a virus or a parasite will feed on the body that it occupies and so the body the parasite can grow and grow and grow and will disrupt the normal functions of that body until they consume the body completely until they deconstruct the order of the body so that is what a virus does and that is also what post-modernism tries to do now did this in language he tried to show with reason because if you understand the traditional worldview you understand this hierarchy of manifestation and we i've that's why i talk about gargoyles and monsters and all these exceptional beings that are on the edge of the world the carnival the place where order breaks down where it starts to flip and spin and do funny things humor irony all of these types of meaning making structures that are on the edge of being i want you to understand them because because these are the tools that are used by post-modernism to destroy to destroy the world and the way that i want people to understand them is to understand that they are also an inevitable aspect of reality that you also should be very careful in trying to completely cutting off these marginal elements getting rid of them because there is a connection between these marginal elements and the untouched and there's also a relationship between these marginal elements and transitions between identities and we need these buffers like veils like the like sphinxes like all these in-between characters these guardians of identities are also at the same time those that if if you're not if you don't encounter them properly they can devour your identity now the best example of that of course is in the story of the sphinx where this sphinx poses an enigma and the enigma that the sphinx poses is not just the question that he asked but it's also his own existence is the enigma which is is being posed to oedipus and oedipus has to answer the riddle of the sphinx and discover what it is that he's talking about um well i won't go into the answer the riddle i think i've talked about it in other videos but the idea is that this faints is this riddle and if you answer the riddle of the sphinx then you can cross over you can enter into the next world or enter into the sacred place or enter into you know enter into the house and to enter whatever it is that this marginal thing is guarding um but if you don't if you're not able to answer the question or the enigma of this this exception then that thing will devour you um and so this is the place where post-modernism puts its foot in in to the discourse and starts to use the methods of parasite and of of uh exception to try to destroy the rule and to try to for the exception to devour the rule and i think that if you're attentive to social discourse i don't have to give a million examples because we see that happening all around us in terms of the way in which in way in which society is laying itself out so i want to read for you another quote and this is a more recent quote this is from a paper uh which was published in the uh it's published in the journal of queer social studies of gay and lesbian social studies i think that's the title of the journal and it's called fetishizing the health science queer theory as an intervention by tyler m arguello and so his quote goes like this queer theory also recasts the meanings of viral and hybrid identities the health sciences privilege essentialized notions of human beings and populations encumbering them with objectivity and empirically determined values beliefs attitudes risks and social trajectories hiv calls into question the centrality of this certainty through contesting binaries and continually exposing social iniquities whereas medicine pathologizes hybridity as the subjectivity of contagion one that creates instability around human identity queer subjectivity tries to interfere in the reciprocal institution constitutions between the naturalized body and the normative social order enabled by medical discourse queer theory looks to dislodge this concordance to insistent adoption of viral processes of rapid transformation mutation and momentary identity processes against which the normative subject wishes to defend itself on one level the endgame of queer theory would be to use these viral processes as a way to infect and hence transform the body politic so i want to go over the elements of this quote with you because it's using you know uh scholar speak and kind of theory speak but what it says is quite clear and quite simple to understand if you look at what it's saying now it says what what queer theory does is it recast the meaning of viral and hybrid identities and so it talks about how ordered identities the the let's say the world is privileges essentialized notions of human beings and population so we have identities a man a woman uh you know a human an animal and a uh an american a canadian you know you have all these different identities a father a mother all of these are essentialized identities that is they are identities that are above your individual but also normalize your potentiality normalize the your all the let's say the messiness of your being they normalize it by giving you an identity like i said man woman father there's all these different identity and so this is what the health science also privileged this according to this theorist but you can understand it in general as a notion that ordered societies ordered structures privileged essentialized uh essentialized uh ideas beliefs attitude all of this is there and so what he says is that hiv he calls into question question this centrality and so what it does is it's not just hiv of course but queer theory itself what it does is that it goes into the idea that that hybrid identities that parasites that these marginal things these in-between things that are there it changes their function instead of seeing them it decentralizes the identities and so it goes in and by creating identities that are rapid succession that change so you one day you're this one day you're that yeah you know one day you're this sexual orientation the other day you're that you have this desire you have that desire by by bringing in this type of rapidly changing and and indefinitely multiple identities what it does is that it questions the supremacy of these essentialized identities right and so even though we we tend to pathologize hybridity we tend to see things that are mixtures between two other things as something which is dangerous and which is not normal and so what it does what hiv does and what queer theory does is that it tries to break that pathology pathologization he tries to to open up you know this notion that the relationship between the relationship between i know it's crazy because it sounds like this shouldn't be possible that what a virus does to a body is not a pathology right it's not it's not disease is not a pathology disease is a way to decentralize these normalized identities it's breaks down identities and in that sense it has to be encouraged you know it has to be it has to change the way we did we view discourse um and so it interferes with this these constitution between what he calls the naturalized body and the normative social order and so what these queer identities what they do is they they jam themselves between the essence man let's say and the body which is kind of a mess of jumbled possibilities and though so in normal in in society there's a connection between the two but what what this type of theory does is it goes in there and it places a bunch of different identities in order to open up the space of chaos right to kind of put to put chaos lift chaos up and kind of bring it up into the normalized order in order to break apart the relationships of authority and power um and so you'd think that this most people don't realize how conscious this is most people look at what's happening they see all the kind of breakdown that's happening and they they're surprised they don't realize that that this is actually a conscious action it is a conscious action to break down the break down the normative order it's there's nothing else that's going on now now one of the craziest things and one of the scariest things is that in order to understand this in order to understand the relationship between the way that postmodern theory and postmodern activism especially the way that it views itself and the way it acts in the world and the way that it recognizes things like you know like a kind of glorification of the exception of the in-between of the hybrid of the viral of the virus uh all of this is actually happening but to order understand it in a complete sense you have to understand what it's reacting to you have to understand that this is a post-world war two phenomena and you have to understand that the nazis and the fascist states they actively viewed the exception the foreigner the the the in-between categories the hybrids they viewed this exactly in the way that jagdev and this queer theorist is saying they viewed it as a disease if you read my camp or if you listen to some of the speeches that adolf hitler gave he talks about these this disease which is in this state and he identifies it with all the same things that the postmodern theorists will talk about so what you end up having is a crazy situation which is you have this nazi idea that everything which is exceptional and hybrid and marginal is acting like a disease which is breaking down the normative order of a society and in their opinion has to now be cut off and chopped off of society but facing it right ahead across from it you have the postmodern type theorists saying yes yes what you're saying is absolutely true we are doing that we are that and we are doing it consciously we are trying to destabilize normative order we are trying to destabilize the identities of family of men and women of countries all of this we are trying of religious identities we're trying to disrupt all these identities and so it's a scary moment it's a scary moment to realize that you know that you know the the unironic yes meme the chad yes meme well this is what you have you have one side saying you're a virus and the other one's saying yes that's what you've got [Music] and so it's a scary thing now what's scarier and why i'm bringing it up today is that as we reach the end of this weird process because we are dealing with the narrative of a pandemic then we have this fl these really dangerous flips these really dangerous extremes that are manifesting themselves and so on the one hand you have the demonstrations you have the the riots and the demonstrations which are there to manifest the side of the viral postmodern kind of weird neo-marxist philosophy and then you also have the clamp down the masks the social distancing this kind of social clampdown to prevent infection and to to to eradicate infection because at first they said we're just going to slow down the virus but no it seems like that's not what they're doing because because all these measures are continuing and are still are still being emphasized it means that they have this weird idea that there can't be anybody who gets this disease we won't stop until nobody has this disease anymore so there's a a strategy of eradication and so and the same people who are on one side are emphasizing the other side in terms of the disease and the same people the the people who are on the other side are emphasizing the other side in terms of the disease maybe it's not as clear in terms of size but what i mean is that the tendencies let's say of two opposing forces and so we're in a very very precarious and dangerous situation because this is all happening in a somewhat maybe not maybe not unconscious i was going to say unconscious maybe it's not unconscious hopefully it's unconscious if it's conscious it's even scarier but this is happening at the same time and these contradictions and these flips of discourse between one extreme of pr of closing down and the other extreme of opening up on both sides in different ways is leading to an explosion it's leading to it's leading to an explosion which it's not clear which side it's going to go on or maybe it's going to go on both sides at the same time which is just the most frightening possibility it seems you know when you there's crazy meme that you might have seen this notion that it feels like we that there's 1984 and a brave new world and and fahrenheit and all these dystopian novels and that somehow we're able to join them into a oncoming dystopia because you don't see it doesn't seem like you could join 1984 and uh and a brave new world but because of our weird like entertainment and culture mixed with a a massive clampdown of control and all of this is very very it's just very very frightening and dystopian and so look what i mostly wanted you to do is to notice this and to see it and to understand that one of the reasons why i talk about the importance and the value of the margin in its proper place where i talk about the possibility of saint christopher of the holy monster of the cherub of the sphinx of the uh you know the all of these marginal creatures is to hopefully help people understand on both sides the role and value of these these identities on the edge because if people don't understand them what's going to happen is there's going to be a fight between the margin and the center and we saw that happen there's going to be a fight between hierarchy and equality or kind of inverse higher or upside downness and we saw that happen a hundred years ago it wasn't pretty and so we definitely don't want it to see it happen again and so guys sorry for the dark tone of this but you know these are dark times and uh all i can say is is uh thanks for your attention and thanks for your support and i'll see you very soon as you know everything i'm doing on the symbolic world is thanks to your support there are many ways you can support what i'm doing you can go to my website the symbolicworld.com support and check out the different ways to support it and you can also look at some of the designs that i'm doing with different people uh trying to uh give people some images that they can that they can identify with in terms of the symbolic world we just developed a new design called the symbolism happens design which uses the very process of symbolism in the design itself that is we wrote symbolism happens kind of in an ancient medieval manner without any space between the world words and hopefully when people look at it they don't understand what it is at first and then suddenly the meaning of the sentence jumps out at them and they get a little bit of insight and hopefully a little bit of what it is that all you guys try to get from my videos and so once again everybody thank you so much for your support and your attention in these strange times and i will talk to everybody very soon
