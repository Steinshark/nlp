ladies and gentlemen in this video I'm going to be sharing with you probably the most insane Chess World Record that I have ever been lucky to witness couple of days ago a chess game was played on chess.com and the two participants involved in that chess game are Magnus Carlson arguably the greatest chess player of all time 17 time world chess champion and fatino Oro FAO is 10 years old originally from Argentina now he's being referred to as potentially the Leonel Messi of Chess falino defeated Magnus Carlson in the game that they played on chess.com fatino did not know how to play chess until 2020 3 and a half years years ago his account was made on chess.com at the bottom left hand of your screen June 2020 his Blitz rating on chess.com was 200 fatino is born in October of 2013 a month before Magnus Carlson won the World Chess Championship this is one of the most stunning results of a singular chess game I've ever seen in my life and I'm going to share it with all of you

folks here we go I told you that I would share one Conant with you in this game and I'm will'll do it right now this was a bullet game it was a one minute chess game played in the chess.com bullet brawl tournament so some of you might already be looking at this and going ah one minute chess what a that's silly play him in a real game well they can't because they don't get invited to the same tournaments chess does not have an open style tournament system like tennis so I doubt FY and Magnus will play each other for a very long time over the board but in today's day and Agee a lot of Chess is played online and also I would argue that a one minute chess game against literally the best chess playing human in history still counts for something so FY shows up to this game at uh the age of 10 and a half and he opens up with D4 now FY plays everything I've played falino in a match uh it was very very close uh I lost by one game but I know that he plays Knight F3 E4 D you know he plays a handful of different openings plays D4 in this game and and I and and I and Magnus plays G6 the reason I said I is because I've actually played G6 many times against foso and generally his playing style is to not let the opponent have fun so what he does against me is he puts two Pawns in the center and I play D6 and then he plays like C3 he foso just plays very solidly not in the most critical not in the most aggressive way but he's a very good practical decision maker uh he's a position I player so the the games that he likes have a level of stability and calmness to them uh and he's 10 which is crazy cuz at 10 years old most kids just want to attack attack attack attack they want to you know sacrifice blah blah blah so in this game because it's bullet Magnus plays Knight F6 you would first of all you would never see Magnus playing this in a in a serious classical chess game period but Knight F6 in particular is a bad move uh because you just allow white to walk into the center and attack your knight like that while also having very good control that is a motif that happens in an opening known as the alakin or alokin defense but you know Magnus does it here there's another opening that Magnus likes to play quite a lot which is known as the Norwegian rat or the North Sea defense and it is very idiotic looking but it's actually it's actually not that horrible so he kind of goes for the same approach here except now he cannot play Knight H5 because his Knight can't go there instead he goes here and runs around and this jumping around with the Knight is very uh reminiscent of E4 Knight F6 E5 and as we can see the exact same Pawn structure watch this I'm going to show you a magic trick ready 3 2 1 d That's this is actually the position that's in the game foso plays Knight C3 Magnus now plays D6 because that's the entire purpose of the black position he runs around with the Knight a little bit he stops white from trapping the Knight gives the Knight a breathing room now this bishop is going to come out now this bishop is going to pressure the center so Magnus plays this kind of provocative way against the young man because he knows look this kid is this kid is Young all I got to do is get into a middle game and I'm going to you know I'm going to overtake him I'm going to win falo like I said very solid so if he has an opportunity to kind of remove tension from the game he will falino likes to play chess in a way that's not going to cause him to get a migraine uh black now plays e takes D6 not actually the best move according to any machine taking with the c Pawn maintaining a level of imbalance with you know no ENC Pawn is is actually preferred I'm sort of surprised Magnus took symmetrically uh I would have thought maybe he would have wanted to create a little bit more of an imbalance but he takes this way which is fine uh and now foso plays Bishop B2 you'll notice foso is not losing any time at all uh that's because it's bullet chess he's playing very very quickly in fact the crazy part is he actually pre moved four moves in a row so FAO played this then he pre moved this move and if Magnus had known that he would have went here to attack his Queen right but that's obviously you know so he pre moved this then he pre moved this move as well which is very funny because that was a capture and then he knew Magnus would take back so he pre moved this move as well so foso pre-moving the entire opening okay castles castles like I said falino likes stability Magnus his pieces are sniping the white position from a distance the game plan for black is to move the bishop to the center and then take the night uh and by the way just a little side note if my microphone cuts out a little bit it's been having some problems recently I'm going to get a new one uh but if you randomly can't hear me that I I actually wouldn't know because it's been cutting in and out for no reason so we see this move Bishop G4 from Magnus right this bishop is a little bit overloaded it's defending two different things but you can't really take here because then you will just get your piece trapped in the corner okay so Bishop G4 white can do a lot of things here white can play Bishop E3 Bishop F4 Bishop G5 Rook E1 you can play for H3 you can play B3 and falino very very solid he's just going to play B3 he's just making sure everything in the position is protected this now loses a little bit of stability but black is never really successfully going to play C5 uh because then white will play Bishop E3 and Rook C1 and just finish up his development so Magnus has gotten all his pieces out so how's festino both guys have developed their armies now what right black can play D5 black can play Rook E8 to activate yet oh activate yet another piece very very tough game very tough position lot of decisions yet to be made in fact that is what happens Rook 2 E8 and like I said foso is a simple man he played Pawn to B3 to defend the pawn on C4 to enable the movement of the bishop which is why he plays H3 now if I'm playing Black here I'm playing Bishop F5 I actually don't really want to take uh I would rather Slide the bishop back to the F5 Square just so it survives just so I have some activity right just so I'm doing something Magnus though follows the bishop into the position and decides to chop off on F3 and pressure the position like this now if you ever want to move your knight you're going to need to defend the pawn on B7 which is why this is the longest thought of the game that Magnus takes and he plays Rook to B8 and again there is no imbalance like the the pawn structure is completely the same white just has an advantage now which is traditionally known as the bishop pair it is better to have two Bishops than it is a bishop and a knight in particular on an open board because the bishop can see to the opposite corner of of of of Earth really uh and uh yeah everything in falo's position is perfect now the the problem with falo as a player when you are his opponent is he takes his time he doesn't just get this little Pleasant position and go D5 and then you know obviously that lose the Knight but I'm just saying like he doesn't just give up weaknesses that easily he's very annoying to play against so in the span of 6 seconds he just plays Queen D2 the idea of Queen D2 is just he's protecting everything and he's going to bring his Rooks to the center like he just doesn't weaken his position you have to provoke fatino in order to get something going in this game Magnus was ready that's why he took on F3 right that's why he played Rook B8 he's now going to wrap the Knight to the F5 square and that is exactly what he does now again this type of play by foso is not necessarily always the best but it is very very solid and very annoying like right now it very well could be the best move could be to go G4 you know it it I don't think it is but a move like G4 is not even half bad in fact it's one of the best moves in the position now black has to play D5 if black doesn't black is going to be much worse you see like me personally I would play G4 here put my Bishop back and then even bring more pawns just to control this I'm not worried about weakening my king but that's the difference between myself and foso foso is like you know what I don't really care if Magnus wants to put the Knight on F5 I'm not going to weaken my position to try to thwart my opponent's plans Knight F5 well now Magnus is making progress right now the advantage is kind of gone it's back to 0 one he's going to take on E3 so the White's Bishop pair Advantage is gone and then black is going to have pressure on that pawn so he's going to put the bishop on H6 for example which is very annoying very annoying and falino plays Rook e one Magnus takes foso plays Rook takes nice little trick right he takes with the Rook because the alternative was to take with the pawn and then potentially risk just having this annoying situation over here and then Here Comes Magnus on the dark squares and again it's just about controlling your opponents and balances so falino sets a mini Trap mini mini because Magnus would never fall for this this move looks like it pins The Rook to the queen but the Rook can move and The Rook will go here taking the rook and it's check that is the most important thing and then all of a sudden foso will be up a full Bishop but Magnus is not just going to lose a piece like that okay Rook E3 Queen E3 FAO gets out of the opening the bishop is not getting to H6 this bishop is very strong pressuring that side of the board this Knight is looking a little bit offside like it can't really go anywhere this Rook is going to control this the only thing Magnus really has going for him is the pressure on White Center but white but he's about to go C5 like A6 White's next move is C5 and suddenly the position for black is falling apart I mean it's completely being disintegrated so very tough moment already and and an an unsuccessful opening definitely for the former world champion but you goat yeah not a great opening and falino has played 18 moves in 8 seconds so the initiative the momentum of the game is definitely with falo so much so that in this position Magnus decides to bail out Magnus could play in a way here that's provocative like he could play Knight D7 what does that do right well you just take the whole file right but then he's going to play C6 and basically this is like when a fighter puts his fists up and he just like come on come get me I'm going to sit right back here I'm going to wait for you to come to me I know you know and I know you have the better position you got to come to me right he could have played like that he could have played a little bit more kg but he decides and he does a little calculation here he forces the issue Queen E8 that's a massive decision because the Queens are coming off the board but more importantly that Rook has to guard that pawn so Magnus already admitting that foso has a better position and he is fine losing the pawn on B7 to potentially create some counterplay with the move C5 here's the problem okay here's the problem with this plan is that best case scenario black will make a draw black is now just down a pawn in an end game he has six pawns white has seven now if everything gets traded here like let's I'm again this is not what's going to happen but let's just say the Rooks come off right the Rooks get traded okay and then in a couple of moves some other stuff gets traded all right like you know black can take on D4 but then we have Knight B5 like what's going to happen in this game is if the Bishops go on the opposite color it's going to be a draw so this is a draw look how quickly it went down to zeros so it's about keeping material on the board and Max doesn't have to do this but foso is like wait a minute C5 uh that's hanging and that's hanging Knight B5 I couldn't take and suddenly black is much worse so all of a sudden the best chess player of all time is in a situation where a split second decision to force the issue in the game leaves him with a very unpleasant end game he's not going to be playing this for a win I mean if he was playing me he'd be playing it for a win but he's not going to be playing it for a win and if he takes on D4 all the pawns will fall B all of them you're going to take on D6 and then it's very simple we're going to advance this Pawn until it becomes a queen so he plays Rook E7 he attacks the bishop on B7 falino by the way could take on D6 here to defend himself but then you would get Bishop D4 and some pressure and The Rook is coming down to E2 so even here with a free Pawn completely free bastino says no thank you no thank you because he understands that black wants counterplay so now Magnus plays A6 Magnus undermining the Knight and the defense of the pawn Magnus wants to land the bishop on that square to put pressure falo takes on C5 puts the Knight on D6 and we have Rook to D7 it would have been slightly better for him to actually take on D6 and allow Bishop D4 but this is a tough position to allow this bishop is very strong so instead of that he tries to go for this still Knight D6 is uh Bishop D4 is playable but okay Rook D7 now what do you do so again falo has a very solid straightforward kind of noons playing style the best way for white to play here to win against this majority is to play B4 B4 undermines Bishop D4 and if Pawn takes you push to C5 and then if black plays something like Knight A4 you have Bishop C6 if black plays something like Knight C but really I don't even know what you can do by the way the Knight is almost trapped you have to look for magic like Bishop B5 so if takes there's takes and then you play from here foso just very simple very very simple Knight E4 not concerned about any of these tactics just trades Magnus does in fact put the bishop on D4 now in a long time control game this is likely going to end in a draw because again Black's disadvantage is no Bon black is down a B Pawn in a king and pawn end game it's losing in a knight end game it's losable in an opposite colored Bishop end game it's not losable and if you don't understand why opposite colored Bishop end games are notoriously very very very difficult to win cuz if you do the math at the end the bishop could sacrifice itself for the remaining pawn and it would be a draw uh and there really there's nothing there's no way the Bishops could interfere with each other so this would probably be a draw King F1 King E2 right falino is going to play though I mean it's a bullet game what are you going to do offer a draw no never King E7 he plays F4 Magnus plays F5 so these pawns are on the same color Square as this bishop if the bishop ever makes it over there there it's going to be really bad news it's going to be like big bad wolf blowing on the house Knight F2 A5 Magnus creating a dark Square Fortress with the pawns on C5 and A5 falo plays Knight to D3 in a in a perfect scenario what will happen here for white absolutely best case is something like this okay uh King D2 let's just say you know black literally does nothing except Shuffle you would play something like King C2 Knight B6 A3 Knight C8 and you would try to play B4 and after you successfully play B4 you now have a one on zero right so now you're going to go over here and you're going to try to push the pawn but if you notice it's it's not looking particularly promising that is the idea King F3 Knight E1 both guys are shuffling but Magna is completely just taking over right I mean the Knight gets into C3 he forces falo to make a pawn move yeah that's it now this is White's extra Pawn it's this ugly duckling on B3 it's never going to go forward there's no way to get to A5 or C5 H yeah it's just a draw Knight to A2 falino plays G4 he's still trying he's still trying Magnus plays King F6 smart move Knight to D3 Knight to C3 Knight C1 and in this position disaster strikes disaster strikes Magnus just moved from A2 he just brought the knight from the A2 Square and I think what he was thinking to do here is to continue to shuffle what Magnus should do in this position is probably just move the king back and forth I guess he could also Play Bishop G1 Bishop D4 but black can't do anything there's no there's nothing black just has to move back and forth and black shouldn't take there's no need to allow white have to have more space like this but in the middle of bullet shuffling Magnus plays Knight A2 it's bullet which is why you know I I hesitated in covering this game because I was like it's not as if it was a wire-to-wire victory it's not as if it was a you know a pounding of Magnus and no they were shuffling late in the game and uh you know what happens it's bullet but I will say just the ability to just completely stay toe-to-toe with Magnus and have zero chance of losing and be up a pawn at 10 years old very impressive and yeah it just you know I'm not saying the victory in and of itself was impressive I think falino will be the first to tell you that but at this point fasino was on stream he was streaming this game and he was like if I lose this if if I can't win this game uh I should retire and uh yeah retire at 10 years old by the way uh and now just very simple by the way you have to extract this knight from the edge of the board the only way to do that is to bring the king he wins control of the dark squares Knight C3 Knight D5 check King C2 he kicks out the bishop and he just takes it and um that is by far the easiest and now this bishop sees this Pawn so the king cannot actually leave the pawn and uh the way you would win this with white is you would play King D2 black would play King G6 King E2 anytime King moves you would take so you would walk the king over here black would run out of moves you would take this Pawn you would take and then you would Queen and then you would win which is why on the 48th move fosa Oro played King D2 and Magnus Carlson resigned now now again I'm going to tell you right now even for the Argentinian fans who watch this I think you can understand that there are more impressive ways to win a chess game than the opponent you know just play playing really quickly and making a mistake like this so some of you are going to be disappointed okay the chess purists are going to watch this and go he didn't actually beat him play him in person play him in a f- minute game play him in a classical play him 10 more bullet games see what happens I understand yes Magnus Carlson is a better chess player than foso Oro for now we don't know what's going to happen with F's career I understand all of that this doesn't make it any less impressive foso had a fantastic opening he played solidly he played great and he forced Magnus to make an uncomfortable decision make a couple of inaccuracies and he was at in no danger of losing this game ever and I will remind you as I did with the full screen the kid did not know how to play chess in 2020 he learned how to play in the middle of 2020 at the end of 2020 he was 1500 he is now a 2900 Blitz rated player he's in the top Point 1% of chess players in the world on chess.com he's 2300 over the board uh he has one IM Norm to become an international master and he's he's the youngest player ever in history to become a f master and get an international Master norm and he just beat the goat he learned chess three and a half years ago he just beat the greatest chess player of all time I don't even know what else to say how's that get out of here
