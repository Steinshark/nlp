today we will talk a bit more about the kind of foundations of graduation in terms of kind of a more simplistic or theoretical way of thinking of validation and how to use that to design your next validation so this is not the teacher how to use spreadsheets to create a bar chart but to say what makes a good pie chart the point I want to make here is there's no kind of universally accepted the framework or Siri about what is a good validation so to some extent it's almost like art there's still lots of like say personal interpretation depends on particular data or user cases just says that I I assume there's no Universal way of writing a good novel people would have their own implementations even they've been centuries people trying to do that computer science are not designed then very good question so actually um so take the validation just because it's nature is kind of across a few different fields so obviously even within the computer size it was related to computer Graphics which is a more on the visual side but also the human computer interaction in terms of how people use it and in my work actually I see quite a few colleagues from the psychology or even Neuroscience departments or the understanding the more fundamental thing for example in the human brain part how the sea react to different visuals so it's kind of very cross-disciplinary so today I really just only want to cover Graphics which are these things the video things you see on the screen and it's composed of two parts and one is called the marks and the other one called channels these might be called different names in different context of discussions and the concept here is probably the more important part and so first and Marx is what I would call data items so let's assume you have a spreadsheet which lists all the products in the supermarket or shop so each row is a product which is an items so these can be represented visually as a mark and so you can imagine you can potentially use a point to represent one product depends on what the validation is maybe a line in your bar chart a bar or you can have more funds repetition for each product and as a shape or even 3D shape you can have different dimensionality without the mark but this really represents one data items or one entity so that's marks and then the other one called the channels which is the visual representation of the attributes of your item so you could say you can think about the Paradox it has to say the name the weight and it will be associated with information like the sales the profits these kind of I call attributes of the items and usually if it will be the columns in your spreadsheet and these are the things you probably want to also include in your audition as well so you want to show the product and then other information social with the product like the names the price the profit and so on so forth um so a large part of the validation is just say mapping the attributes to the visual so I say I want to show the price then I can choose to use say the color or maybe the size to show the color then there's a choice there and often there are more than one attributes you want to show and then you have a choice between which one to use which channel just taking a very simple example to explain this so if this is like a scat plot and we have some showing the some kind of product information and we're showing the profits of each product the sales product and then the type of product so it's showing three attributes in the data we are using a 2d graph because and the color itself is not the spatial Dimension but also that's usually actually a good thing because if you're not limited to spatial Dimension that means you can be on 3DS so you can go say five six seven ten and so on and so forth okay and then back to the marks and channels what are the marks here okay the marks are the uh the type the colors basically is that right uh I think that's the channel uh oh sorry yeah so Marx is the one the dots exactly exactly so the marks represents each items in English will be each product which will be the dot and then the channels we already said colors color and also the place on the graph yeah exactly so I mean more formally we call these positions basically X Y coordinates or the positions so this looks a little bit busy but really to show you it just says okay when I have some attributes that I want to show for example the price what will be the best channel to show do I use position color or maybe 3D or maybe tilted the levels yeah so I'm not going to go through that you've got the list but generally what people did is did lots of experiments for example they want to find out whether use position is better or using colors better so lots of small experiments the pairwise comparison the kind of eventually become this list and it's not second absolute order for example these two say either using the luminance or the grayscale or use the saturation level of the color they have kind of similar level of effectiveness so the third and the top is the more effective ones in general at the bottom are the less effective one thing they are particularly old so very quickly see the position X Y is actually very effective and then say for example 3D shapes is usually not very good so at least in academics there's a big part of the visualization research Community think you probably should try to avoid 3D if you can just because it's not very good at the replanting and also we have these two parts so the left part is to represent numbers basically so these are type of data you can see Europe and use serial number say price profit and on the right hand side is the more categorical type of values for example different type of products say they have they have distinction but they you can't really do think any operations they're not usually a member and again so there's a limited number of channels usually can be used for different type depends on type of attributes the effectiveness is also a little bit different okay uh yeah and so this is people do experiment try to understand how accurate a channel is so each line you have is one channel and then so this one would be the actual value the x-axis and the y-axis will be the perceived value and so you can see the purple line here is lens essentially similar to position so the actual value is very similar to the user perceived values so which is a good thing so anything under this for example brightness that means people underestimate so if for example if you make twice as bright and then people maybe only think only increased by 50 percent whereas on this side about this purple line are the ones which people overestimate and so what they included here is electric shock so if you're increasing voltage by just a tiny bit the people feeling is way way more painful yeah you have a number there which is 3.5 times more painful but yeah but I think the more important thing is just the kind of General saying you over and estimate and also the important thing is you try to be in the middle as much as possible that which give you an accurate yes but otherwise you have to you can actively compensate for this which is not what we usually do as a human okay and so this is the last one so we're going to do a one of these little experiments we mentioned earlier on just to see how accurate we add human and do we actually tend to over underestimate the visual representations and so I have three representations here so we're all representing a number so the first one I use color so I use say the darker the color the bigger the value and they're going to ask Richard to pick say do you think this one on the right is one half times bigger or darker or or more saturated or or twice or two and a half times more saturated compared to the color on the left um so if you're trying this yourself I would recommend trying not to sing too long about it always think about it because when you usually look at the audition you would not think about is it accurate or not or question your decisions so just take your kind of instant and gut reaction and go with it and I will show the answers after this but if you're interested and you can put that in the comments what do you think it should be I'm going to say sorry this is darkness is it yeah it's a darker means more larger value I'd say twice two okay and we're gonna do all of these three and then come back to look at it yeah and then this one is using lens so I think that's two and a half times two and a half times okay and this one is area the last one 1.5 yeah 1.5 okay now I'm looking at it and I'm changing my mind straight away because no no don't think so this is the important thing so the key here is not to think too much and use um kind of your first intuition for reaction because and when you look at the actual the devil Edition you probably would not just think about there really is it's just say you'll have some impression immediately and then that's what will be answered most of the time you're not going to scan carefully think about the question of your choice is so the answer is actually it's always twice oh they're all twice always twice ah okay and so I mean quite a few times people actually overestimate this part as well also thinks maybe it's more than twice darker than this obviously they can set the RGB values if you look at the here before so the saturation is about here so it's people tend to overestimate and then areas here people tend to underestimate yeah so again so it doesn't work for everyone I think even I do this in class right I have like sometimes close to 100 students each person would have slightly different accuracy for these channels but but in general I think these are kind of much larger scales experiment with hundreds or even more people and it has been kind of revalidated afterwards as well so that's usually accurate all the changes that it's made to the image it now thinks that that is over 99 likelihood of being a coffee mug can you see the coffee mug there if it is it's uh it's definitely by one of the more abstract the way we solve this is with something called a Bellman equation so the Bellman equation describes how good a particular action choice is
