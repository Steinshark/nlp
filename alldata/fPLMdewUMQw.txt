ladies and gentlemen this video has been such a long time coming let me say you got a friend if you've got a family member if you yourself have ever seen one of these ads these walmart automation or amazon automation ads and you're thinking of getting involved this is the video you need to watch if you've ever wondered man is it really true that i can just make 100k a year with an amazon store is it that easy this is the video for you so i had to get the suit on because honestly i wanted to be authoritative it's teaching time boys this is my new this is the sifu suit in the 10 million dollar studio guys with the lambo in the back that's how you know i'm trustworthy guys is the fake lambo in the back honestly this video is very unprompted normally i have my topics that i'm going to cover and this one's off course it's off topic it's off track why because one guy really pissed me off dude now let's go to the board so i can show you more okay what got me all in a huff right uh well it's guys like this okay now these aren't the guys this is just the setup okay for the record okay hey what's going on my name is logan i am with the man the myth the legend right this guy you've never seen before in your life mr cgi face anyway what whatever what's his name what's his name here this is the e-commerce wizard he's been doing oh-ho he's the wizard dude e-com wizard bro e-commerce automation for a minute helping hundreds of clients make money online manny why don't you just take a second and explain why e-commerce automation makes sense in this day and age it makes so much sense right now because where else can you make you know 15 a month on your money 15 a month on your money guys that's just the start of the bold bold claims that these guys make now i feel like this whole industry of uh people should be called douche bags in front of expensive cars selling scams because you know these guys are honestly a dime a dozen you see this guy here he's another guy and he's actually the guy that really pissed me off he's the reason i'm making this whole video he's here selling a little amazon automation store as well what's up guys nolan johnson here you've probably seen my ads talking about drop shipping and why it's not a good business the reason why is because a lot of people don't know what they're doing so what we do is we actually set up a fully automated amazon store in your name and we handle everything from a to z it's a hundred percent automated a hundred percent automated guys just like that and you know what he just started a second branch too where he's selling a walmart automated stores he's charging fifty thousand dollars up front and saying that you can make 100k a year in profit that's what he's projecting uh now that's ridiculous and i'll explain why in a second but he says how to have a completely automated walmart store to make you daily profit and then up here he violates a walmart's trademark right there and uses their slogan to i guess try to affiliate himself with walmart like make money live better isn't that that walmart slogan save money live better walmart uh but then he go ahead he has these right here which is like as seen on and it's every single news outlet in existence it seems like uh which this is a graphic pool and it's it's on a bunch of other websites as well um i found it on mattclarkagency.com i'm at selfstorageinvesting.com with a simple reverse image search so uh that's it's not even his image he just like pasted this graphic to try to seem authoritative but then you know you go up here he says 100k a year in profit literally in the tiny fine print he says we cannot guarantee sales income or profit your results may vary well vary by how much you're putting 50k down and then guess what that's not even the end of the story then you got to pay for inventory you got to pay for everything and then if you're lucky enough to make a profit you get 70 of it and they're saying oh we're going to make we're going to make 100k a year what if you don't well uh you have all the risk that's the beauty of amazon automation and walmart automation is no matter what the guy the guru the guy standing in front of the rich the rich car they make 50k right away if you open a store no questions asked look they don't do anything and they've made fifty thousand dollars maybe they run your store a little bit they pass it off to a few uh workers of vietnam a few va's virtual assistants in vietnam this is how the business model works maybe they make a few sales to tell you hey go shut up for a little while but maybe they don't and what happens what happens if they don't what's your exposure to risk well you have all of the risk they put up no money for your store and they say they they make excuses that the reason they make these stores the reason they need to invest with you is because oh i can't open more than one store on amazon you ever heard this before i can't open more than one store in walmart that's why i have to partner with you that's not true it's not even true yes they can why wouldn't they do this look if they're so confident they're gonna make all this money why wouldn't they take their own money invest it and just have put it under someone else's name and pay them like five percent to be the uh you know non-working managing director or ten percent i'll tell you why because in that case they take the risk no no they don't want to take the risk these people have figured out that a lot of people are dumb enough to take all of the risk and only have a small amount of upside what's worse is they encourage you to go into debt they tell you that uh you should take out a personal loan for the cost of the of the store okay that's that's a gem next question what if i don't have that much money what if you're a sucker who doesn't have any money you're not a qualified buyer what do you do you take out a personal loan right credit scores are in the 700s and you have good income with a good debt to income ratio lendingtree or sofi will give you a personal loan all you have to do is visit their website and then come back and apply do uh work with us that's right guys use a personal loan for a business high interest rates that's great dude this guy's encouraging this look at this guy not only does he encourage personal loans check out what else he encourages let's say you have 20 000 available on your credit card ooh 20k on your credit card to fund those orders yeah you forgot that you're also finding all the order forms go ahead charge up the rack up that credit card to fund these orders we can help you make roughly ten thousand dollars a month in profit if we max your card out every single month guys just just max your credit card out every single month do it for the amazon automated store guys again do you notice do you notice you take all the risk and they take nothing and then watch how he tries to compare subway where you get a store like a physical store and a known brand to drop shipping and tries to say oh look how cheap the franchise fee is we only charge 50 000 that's one-fifth the price of your average subway what you can't even compare the two what one you're getting a store the second one you're getting nothing what are you getting walmart seller third-party seller account that you could have opened for free these people literally have no there's there's there's no morality here guys there's no there's no thought of like wait what's gonna happen to these people if they they lose their money they lose their 50k investment now at this point you might go to their refund policy and try to you know feel better because they say that if they don't profit enough within the first 12 months to cover the upfront investment they will refund you wow that's very nice of them until you figure out it's void in the event of and they have a bunch of really common things like hey if you if you don't have the exact amount of capital at the time you've already maxed out all your credit cards hey lack of necessary capital that restricts store growth and which is any time that they can't fund the order right away hey lack no refund void you get your voided refund but you know what else is crazy any potential refund is void in the event of any suspension of the client store guys do you know how common it is for amazon stores to get suspended for example i know we're talking about walmart right now but you know how common it is for amazon stores to get suspended we haven't seen that many walmart uh suspensions yet and i'm sure those are coming though as all of these shady guys get involved in the business it's all the time and the key is that that happens not when because you're not touching the store not when you do something wrong they do something wrong and then the refund's gone so they screw up it's written it's literally written in the contract that if they mess up your store you get screwed out of your 50k you literally can't make this stuff up how mind-blowing is that and these these terms and conditions are common dude they're common across the industry now finally i want to use some math to break down why these guys are scumbag liars and i say these guys uh very loosely and i also say scumbag liars as an opinion guys you know so i've got an alternative plan for you that you could ask any amazon automation store guy or any walmart automation store guy to help you or sorry to help them and they'll never take you up on this deal even though theoretically if their numbers were right they'd make more money with my plan okay so you ready go to your amazon or walmart automation guy and when they say hey front me the money uh because basically i i need to create more stores but i can't because of these suspensions that's what they say right that's their explanation for why they need your money they say i can't create more than one third-party store instead tell them this tell them hey i'll put my name on that store if you just give me 10 of the profits not 70 like they're talking about they always talk about the 70 30 split right they're going to give you 70 they're going to get 30 say no you you the amazon automation guy you get 90 i'll get 10 but i don't put up any money so i'm just putting my name on the business i'm letting you open up as you know another third party store uh you just give me 10 000. so let's run their numbers let's say you know your store makes a hundred thousand dollars in the first year like they say it's going to they're gonna say it's a hundred thousand dollars in profit if they have it their way year one they make with eighty thousand dollars hope everyone's clear on how i got to that number my way where they get ninety percent of the profits they'd make more money in the first year you see that why would they do this if they're confident they could make a hundred thousand dollars a year why would they do this were they only taking 30 of the profits it's worse for them well wait let's let's repeat that if they could really make those numbers why would they choose to make less money when they're the ones putting in all the work they even say you don't even have to put any work so what am i getting at here they know that with my plan where they just pay somebody to take you know to build a store but they they put in all the risk they know that they're taking the risk and they don't they're not confident they can do the stores they can't get the actual profits they say they can't they know that so what do they do they rig it so no matter what they make 50k they make the initial storefront fee and they run they know they don't need you anymore they have the money it's no risk on them what are you going to do if you don't like it you're going to sue them oh they'll fight you with your own money that's the problem with these scammers what you're going to sue the guy who charged you 50 000 he'll fight you with his 50 000 good luck and maybe he'll settle out of court you know later like how where are you getting your money back guys so i want you to think more intelligently about this stuff these people are absolute scumbags because you got to ask yourself do the math why would they if they could actually do what they say why wouldn't they just take the money why would they give you such a high cut in all of these automation things they always give you like 70 of the profits why would they do that if you're doing no work if they could really do it it is literally a confidence game it's a confidence scam i know most of you guys this is obvious right it's obvious to most people that you know these guys can't really do it they're fly-by-night salesman they literally they literally are encouraging you to go into personal debt and maxing out your credit card every month okay and yeah that's basically it send this to your friends family loved ones brothers sister mothers uh if they're getting involved in a scam because i know they are listen my mom got in a scam the other day i'm just going to be honest he'd be straightforward with you she got in a ponzi scheme mlm i'm sorry it happens to everyone even sifu's mom just is what it is uh so yeah that's it basically thanks for watching i'll see you next time i know what you need this ain't what it seems nothing but a trick trying to sell me on a dream but that was where you lost wake up smell the me [Music]
