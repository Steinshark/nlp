ladies and gentlemen welcome to the next chess drama chess drama which also revolves around the subject of cheating which as we all know over the last year plus here in late 2023 has been a very hot topic particularly in the case of Magnus Carlson versus Hans Neiman but extending to other players other personalities uh weighing in on the game and in this video I'm going to go through an event that happened yesterday which was November the 20th where basically hiar Nakamura yes that Hikaru Grandmaster Hikaru Nakamura the one that we all know and love and watch all the time was kind of accused of cheating now it wasn't a full-on accusal it was basically everything but an accusal it was kind of more like a let's look into this and I'm going to unpack all of this for you and this Channel and myself in particular I've developed a bit of like this reputation like oh if drama happens he's going to cover it and I would go to argue that while I will cover certain dramatic things in the Chess World because we as humans are we're like flies drawn to poop you know we're going to watch the dramatic stuff and the beefs and whatnot you're still going to get in my opinion an objective balanced take on this channel and I like to provide as much context as possible and leave you with my opinion like I did during the Hans nean thing which hopefully you can confirm or deny this in the comments I thought I did a pretty neutral and decent job relaying that information so what am I talking about and who accused Taro of cheating and what is going on okay yesterday I logged into Twitter oh and by the way last night in London London you've been incredible just amazing events here and I will be back um I saw this tweet from Hikaru Vladimir appears to be referencing my record is he really accusing me of cheating and he tagged uh levov chess which is a big big big and very good YouTube channel and then he said uh this is yanish said are you jumping on this accusation as well by tweeting this garbage and I was like what and so I S I started going into the rabbit hole right so who who's accuse what's going on so I clicked this tweet right the Yan tweet and said because he's the hero Gotham deserves but not the one it needs right now now this is a quote from The Dark Knight which by the way just an incredible Trilogy I mean just incredible Ben Affleck is also an incredible Batman but uh that trilogy with with Christian bill was spectacular and by the way I don't know if Yan did this on purpose to just like throw the Gotham in there or if that was accidental if he did it on purpose absolute Mastermind um and what he is referring to is Vladimir karnick Vladimir kiik is the 14th World Champion uh legend of the game arguable top five definitely a top 10 you know we could we could debate that and he's referencing Vladimir's chess. page which says some small new piece of Statistics recently noticed that a player had scored 45 and a half out of 46 consecutive games against an average ELO of 2950 which is an equivalent to 3600 performance in those 46 consecutive games I believe everyone would find this interesting interesting I believe everyone would find this interesting now again when uh chess players uh play against people and we think that they are cheating and we are making content out of it we frequently refer to their moves as interesting I saw that Grandmaster Eric Hansen AKA chesra said the same thing I mean I am echoing what he is saying that's what you say because you don't want to directly accuse it's interesting we should look into it um now kramnick said that that is that is what karnick put in his ch.com profile and Vladimir kramnick over the last let's say 6 months or so here in 2023 has put out a lot of things which I will get into and he uses this kind of like a Facebook status you remember that back in the day we used to have Facebook statuses that was like a thing we did he he Updates this all the time and I will show you some others and he's really gone on like a like a cheating mystery Expose and and a research and everything and I will talk about that momentarily but what does Jan's tweet mean chess players are so weird because we never just come out and say anything everything is layered everything is always like hidden everything is always so people were like is he just confirming is saying that like kramnick is the hero that we deserve but we don't need him right now I I don't know I I don't know I really don't know I don't know how people read this um but Hikaru clearly was like why would you even you know respond to this and and actually Yan pishi who I hope one day will follow me um tweeted uh you know this re a while back which was for you people when they discussed wearing headphones during chess and Yan said it is impossible to I'm just reading this in a Russian accent cuz Jan's Russian it's impossible to imagine that a player still is allowed to play with headphones you know cuz hearo was allowed to play with headphones and again it's like one of these things like you know rules for the you know is he just saying that hikaro doesn't play by the rules because he's too big for the rules right like you know I don't know what he's saying or if he's just insinuating that hikaro gets the play with headphones but I and that could be fair play an issue again uh should the players not play with headphones probably so I don't really know what happened in this instance I would imagine that Hikaru is not deliberately violating rules of of a tournament I you know again but I don't know the point is that hikaro responded and kramnick is talking about somebody that went 45 and a half out of 46 is that Hikaru this is hikaru's games from November 16th to November 17th this was during hikaru's run back to 3300 on chess.com if you count the top game versus Ur that is one then we go to the previous page and now we start counting up two three four five 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 this was a draw 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 hikaro won 45 out of 46 games yeah I mean right oh oh God I mean if a new account on ch.com wins 45 out 46 games getting banned like it could be Hikaru playing from his toilet you know one day when he's bored but he's going to get banned because they're not going to know who it is um so he's talking about hikaro right like again unless karnick just found another person uh which is weird that that was that's a weird thing to put out publicly like about about that's a weird like CU he knew what he was doing I so what was the logic of putting it out publicly to get us talking about it what would we find interesting about this let's dive deeper what what what is so interesting about this Hikaru did what is called farming okay not where you you know use a hoe and grow crops and tend to animals farming is when you play against people who you can beat a lot and Hikaru has to because there's not a lot of people at 3200 on chess.com so he played a 2900 and he beat that 2900 and then he proceeded to play that 2900 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 more times and that 2900 ran away and didn't want to lose 10 games in a row so then hikaro turned his attention to another player who is rated 29.95 and his fed rating this is I believe leevon brigad I was reading I I I don't maybe it was on his CH like I don't know I I think I saw that somewhere um but uh maybe I'm completely making that up but I think I saw it in like a Tim stamp of a Hikaru video um and you know hikaro beat this person 1 2 3 4 five six seven times in a row and this is I am right about 250 points lower rated than Hikaru yeah so he beat him also many times in a row then and by the way 99 right here it's an 11 move game right so hiar was averaging like 80% here he played 97 he played a very nice game probably what his opponent blundered 83 you know 92 whatever I mean it's and then hikaro played Liam putam now Liam putam is a young 13-year-old title player who played hikaro a lot and lost a lot because he's not good enough to beat Hikaru like ever and if it was it would be like one and 15 that's I'm not being disrespectful to Liam hikaru's probably the best three player on the planet and second best Blitz player on the planet and could vary in 40% of the days he's the best B player on the planet 60% of the days is probably Magnus and hearo beat this guy then he beat angal like one game then he went back to beating Peola you know like and then he beat arton from from Iran and again it's like Hikaru beat a bunch of people in a row until he lost to this this Turkish dude uh several times who's 3100 and is capable of beating Hikaru sometimes now he's talking about hikaro why why is he talking about hikaro we will get into that in a moment um well let's get into it now what yeah I did anybody find karo's record interesting because I was just like he's farming people is it like an exceptional odds I was reading somewhere somebody did a report like hik Caro's odds of winning every one of those games based on the ratings was like this and then you know the odds of him winning 45 out of 46 games was 2% like the odds that he would lose a game were at least once were 98% um yeah it was like an improbable run having said that you have to realize like when you're down 7even nothing you want to get it over with I mean there's other psychological effects there you just kind of want to like play and hikaro just beats you down morally and I mean I'm sure if Magnus decided to play 50 Blitz Games at some point he would do the exact same thing Magnus frequently logs in and beats people like 18 to one right so I don't know and Hikaru has played Blitz online for like 20 years like hikaro was playing Blitz on the internet before the internet had chess okay this guy's been playing Blitz on online forever I mean literally forever and he is able like Steph Curry like you watch Steph Curry can make 49 out of 53s right like is he on steroids like I mental physical I don't know right I don't know how steroids even work in basketball so that was just a weird thing and you know karnick has said a lot of things that I like understand and agree with um this was recently uh KCK has been on this Crusade this was after he played a few games and recently and he said I have decided to stop playing on ch.com from tomorrow on too many obvious cheaters here nothing is done to clean the platform from those small Crooks harsh words but true would continue informing those who care publishing interesting statistics though and he has apparently by by by saying this about Hikaru uh hope interesting yes he did say it was interesting hope would come back one day if it will be clean from at least obvious cheaters I promise I will continue trying my best to save chess from this disease as much as I can fighting with natural squeamishness what a word I don't even know what that means which is the main reason my chess come departure the strength is in truth peace I want that as a tattoo because there's a g in the letter strength but I I want that as a tattoo with the piece the strength is and Truth look um here's the problem right uh because Vladimir has actually said several things that I do find interesting for instance he once you know went on chess.com and published some statistics and you know he had the statistics which said um you know he is sharing uh uh accuracy of various strong Grand Masters in recent rapid tournaments 15 minute 3 second bonus um and uh you know the most accurate player is the young Bellar Russian Grandmaster Dennis lazovic who is rated like 2560 Fay and his average accuracy over 32 games is 95% on the flip side Dennis lazovic plays really solidly and makes a ton of draws right and then you have Maxim vrav 18 games 93% accuracy fuja 92 Sean 92 artv 92 kamsky Carlson so it's like you know he published this list and so I don't exactly know what the argument is right like I don't know uh but but but he just publishes these stats and what are we like are we supposed to look at this list and go anybody that's not in the top 10 of chess players in the world does not belong here like lavic mvl is outside of the top 10 but he's a really good rapid and Blitz player um Sean kamsky you know like is that what we're supposed to do so I don't I don't know I don't know what the goal here is because Hikaru is not even on this list right like Hikaru either doesn't have enough games in this time control or plays at an accuracy below 88.9% % which you can see up here is the lowest on the list it's an e giri so but this is like what karnick has been posting and kramnick also recently posted something perhaps the only statistics of his that I've looked at and been like oh wow that's really interesting so this is a this is very very very blurry but essentially what this is is title Tuesday players players who play in title Tuesday the the weekly tournament on chess.com that happens two times every Tuesday with lots of money these are a bunch of players and this is their performance rating in the 7th to 10th rounds the money round is the 11th round the final round of the tournament so if you do well between rounds 7 and 10 you will be in the money generally and this is a list of people who perform at this level between rounds 7 and 10 so let's say you're performing player two and you're 331 performance when in the last round you are fighting for a prize you perform at an ELO of 3,224 now that either means one of two things you are really clutch like you have great nervous system and when you have to play for the money you need to win you win and the difference between these two numbers right here is 1993 when you don't fight for money you actually play worse cuz you just don't care so again this list is basically saying some people are clutch or they're cheating right I mean that's those are the only like unless I'm missing something am I missing something I don't know like you know again why does your performance go up so much in the money round when you are playing for the money either you're really good you hold yourself together I can't I don't hold myself together but essentially I think the point here is to say a lot of people have you know an abnormally large win rate in the final round or performance in the last round of a money event like title Tuesday okay okay and karnick has brought up other things that I actually kind of agree with for example literally millions of people cheat at chess every single well not day but millions of people cheat at chess thousands of people cheat at chess every day for no reason you probably played a cheater in the past week it could be a 14-year-old hanging out with their buddies that like found a chess bot and they're all hanging out in a group chat together and just cheating against people cuz they they that's what they do for fun and then they're going to get banned it could be somebody that like the way they play chess is they they I I've you know I know I've not I don't know people like this but I've heard of of things like this people will just play games and use stockfish every now and then because they think that somehow teaches them and it makes them better they'll get banned like they will but people cheat all the time in completely actually truly meaningless games at like the 1500 level 800 level 700 level I don't know why I went down 100 I meant to say like 300 so kck's point is why would title players not cheat online if money is involved and there have been other discussions kramnick said he thinks 20% of title players cheat Fabiano Carana said he thinks 50% of title players like have cheated I think that's the he didn't say that during a title Tuesday half the players cheat um but he said something like about the 50% like just at some point hikaro thought it was closer to karnick I think he thought the Fabiana one was a bit high but I might be misquoting him and Danny wrench on the recent state of chess.com which is a show that he does every quarter basically where he talks about updates on chess.com developments on chess.com fair play and cheating on chess.com said it's more like 3% something around like 3% people who have been banned title players have been caught cheating banned confessed on ch.com because on ch.com to get a second chance account which is a account where you know you can play again after they discover that you were cheating um you know you said yeah I was cheating and I'm sorry please let me open a second account nobody says anything um me personally I don't know what the number is but I do subscribe to the theory of if a 2700 rated Grandmaster a top 10 top 20 even top like 40 grandmas tried to cheat during a title Tuesday and needed to cheat four times over 11 games just for one move I don't know how you catch that frankly I'm not sure you can catch that maybe if Danny was sitting here with me or somebody from the fair play team they they would say we would have a debate but I don't know and to me that is the scariest part not to mention Daniel dubov Russian chess grandmas super strong guy by the way after you watch this video go watch him do muscleups there's like videos of him doing muscleups it's like an unbelievable stuff uh on YouTube uh he went on a podcast and he said here's the real problem and this is fascinating let me let me f food for thought before you go to that muscleup video stockfish Leela modern engines are 3600 3700 it would be really stupid to cheat with those Bots right because all the algorithms now are revolved at that level right however a chz bot from 200 let's say 10 13 years ago can still beat generally I think every human on the planet in a fate in a heads up game equal everything so what if they Ed that modern day engines would analyze a Bots games from 15 years ago and go this is such an idiot human they probably will not even this is this is what dubov said I'm not saying this is fact I'm simply reporting all of this to you I am saying that a bot that reviews a Bots games from 15 years ago go what was he what was he doing like what an idiot you know and that's the real issue in my opinion it's like I'm actually not sure you can con conclusively lock in a cheating accusation with evidence against anybody unless you physically catch them now chess.com does a seemingly very very very good job at this meaning they have a massive list of people who they have said you are cheating and the person said yep sorry and that's really weird because that opens up another whole topic of like should getting banned on ch.com and confessing to it mean that you can't play Live tournaments do you get a live suspension too like who's the international governing body of the game cheating wise right because we have Fay live over theboard tournaments in chess.com hybrid events online events but I mean ch.com is probably a larger International entity and known by more people than fay F is the established governing body of course but somehow they they they got to work together and that's this is really weird this is where it gets really weird for me because uh I'm not like I'm I'm I'm I don't know I listen to some of the stuff karnick and Fabiano say and I go yeah I mean I can you know I totally get their point um last thing today hikaro played against Magnus in title Tuesday and hikaro started with H4 um because I guess they were trolling each other and I guess Magnus was also playing H4 and H5 in every game and then you know it was H4 B5 H5 Battle of the 3300s perhaps the highest rated game ever in history on ch.com 3318 versus 3302 crazy absolutely crazy Magnus now higher rated than hearo and ch.com and what happened in this game is absolutely wild A6 was played Knight bd2 they traded and in this position Hikaru played Bishop to C4 he played Bishop to C4 he Mouse slipped he meant to play Bishop to D3 of course just developing his Bishop he played Bishop C4 he mous slipped and Magnus did not let him off the hook he took right away it was a mouse slip uh and then you know again the rest of the game is not really worth looking at hekaro a sportsman doesn't just resign after playing Bishop C4 plays a little bit probably could have beaten me like in a handful of these games down a full piece because I would have been terrified but you can't beat Magnus down a piece Magnus chases him around is going to win all his pawns he going to you know hunt this King he resigns um and then afterward Magnus tweeted when he took a screenshot of the move Bishop C4 and he said wins all of these online events yet doesn't know how pawns capture interesting which of course is a reference to the original which is some small new piece of Statistics uh you know I believe everybody would find this interesting and this is the Chess World in a nutshell uh passive aggressive Petty sarcastic trolling each other constantly this is this is very funny because when I read this I read this as a jack jab at the original you know at this I read this as a jab at at that and um this is now going to be an existential problem for chess uh do I think that there are titled players who cheat I've actually never thought about that I always just assumed no no way like why would they it would jeopardize everything right um but now I'm not so sure because I've started really thinking about it and I I frankly am am not so if if people don't want to oblig by the honor System we could have a cycling situation remember I think Lance Armstrong that whole thing happened and if the excuses everybody's cheating so I'm cheating guys I don't know where we're headed guys I don't know I know where I'm headed I'm headed to um I'm headed to the airport quite soon so um I'll be back in New York London was incredible uh chess cheating scandal part three new chapter hikaro versus kramnick and nepo and I mean crazy I just and for the record uh I don't I guess I really didn't mention this throughout the video um I I don't think Karu was cheating at Jess I like it's a laughable thing to even again it's binary right he either is or isn't and to me he is very very very very clearly not um and if he was and like other players were like where do we even stop like they're all cheating like they're all cheating and I I don't know the whole thing is just so laughable to me uh I don't know and it's it's very it's tough for me because I agree with some of the stuff krck post I find it interesting like him Fabiano and then and then this I just I don't I don't even know what to do I don't know I don't know that's all get out of here
