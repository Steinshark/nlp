- We have a $30,000 budget for this video but we're gonna start off with a penny. So we're gonna slowly work our way up and then do $1,000. - Is this a joke? - 5,000. - What? Is this fake? - 10,000. - Do you guys know what's going on? - Watch the whole video. The further you get into it,
the crazier the tips will be. This first one's a penny. - How are you? - Hello.
- Hey. - Two? - Yes.
- Yes. Thank you. - So do we just tip the penny and just walk out? All right, viewers, here we go. One penny. So we get bigger the more we go on. Trust me, we will do $10,000 eventually. It's right there. Do you guys have a cup of water? - We have bottled waters. - How much is it? - 1.89. - Thank you. I don't want the change. Thank you. This is a dollar in quarters and we're gonna head out. This time, we're gonna tip $5. Ooh. Don't worry, guys. We're slowly working our way up. We're #pranksters, man. This is gonna be a gnarly prank, bro. Over here. Five smack-a-roos, five
smack-a-roos, 10 smack-a-roos. 10 smack-a-roos right here
on the corner of the table. - I don't know but I don't wanna take it. - All right, Jake Paulers, we're gonna leave a 20 and abort, abort, abort. These waitresses, they're doing a great
job giving out water. You take that one, I'll take this one. So we just did 20 so now they get 40. There we go. So next we do $100, right? - How much? - 1.61 with tax. I can't break 100 unfortunately. - Okay, you can just keep the change. - No, I'm sorry. I cannot accept the change of 100 for a bottle of water though. - That's fine. Thank you. - Thanks.
- Yeah. Some good water. - We actually don't... We're gluten-free.
- Yeah, I don't want any. - Sorry.
- That's fine. - We're gluten-free, apparently. $100. - How are you doing today? - Good.
- Good, how are you doing? Just a water.
- And a water. I took a picture of
what's on the snow card. Roger, roger, delta, delta. Am I making sense? All right. $200. - Hi, it's gonna be $30.59. Appreciate it. Here's all your food. Sorry, by the way. - That's good, man. Here you go. Here's your tip. - What? - Here you go. Our little secret. Shh. - Hey wait. - Subscribe to MrBeast, he's a good guy 'cause he just helped

best thing I've ever had. Thank you. Have a good day, man. Can I just sit here? - Thank you.
- Here, you're welcome. - Thank you. First before we leave, we
must taste test the water. - That's good water. - Has a hint of styrofoam. That's how I like it.

- There you go. 21 Savage is on the table. ♪ 21 ♪ - So we're breaking
the rules a little bit. We got kind of hungry so we're not just
ordering water this time. We're ordering water and some food. So as you can see, our bill was $111. So that should cover... that should cover the bill, right? So then, is that what we should tip him? - Nah. - This is $2,000. Let's see how he reacts to
$2,000 compared to a penny. - He just walked over, dude. - Do you mind if we sit here? - Anywhere. - Okay.
- Okay, thank you. - Hello, how you guys doing? - Hey, good.
- Good, how are you doing? - Can I have a water? Honestly, some pretty good water. - That is a very good water.

thing I've ever seen happen. I really hope that was on camera. - Oh my God. - I saw what they were doing, just enjoy the moment. Just smile. - They started laughing,
they knew something. - Oh my God.
- As they enjoy their puddin'. - This is incredible. - Something about a bearded man spoon-feeding another guy. - All right, Jake Paulers and Logangsters. How much money is that? - A grand. - How about that? - Two grand. - That's three grand.
- Three grand. - How about that? - Five grand.
- That's like four and a half. - Okay.
- How about that? That's like seven. That's 10. Dude, just holding this feels insane. - I wanna hold it. - Hey, Jake, you act like a waitress. Give me... or a waiter. Give me a water. Here's 10 grand. - Hey, guys, how are y'all doing? - Hey. Good.
- Good, how are you doing? - I'm good, my name's Alaina. I'll be taking care of y'all. - How do we pull this off? - Thank you.

some service over here? - Yeah. Can you wait on them? - I'm like, "Hey, can I get
some service over here?" - Can I get you guys something to drink? - Do you have any water? - What's going on right now? - You tell us. - I have no idea. I'm really confused. ♪ MrBeast ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ MrBeast ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ MrBeast ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ MrBeast ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ - I went over there and Brett was like, "I
think they need help." So I came back over here
and nobody was over here and it said "Water was great." And, like, a stack of hundreds. I don't understand. Why did they do that? - Why not? - That was way too big of a tip. - Funny story. We recorded this video a few days ago and since then, a ton of news
stations have picked this up and ran stories on this. We were on the front page
of Fox News, Sky News, all these different news
stations were covering it. Snapchat covered it. We were on Indian national television and just so many news
stations picked up this story about me ordering two waters
and then leaving a $10,000 tip which is kind of funny
because I've done many videos that are much bigger than $10,000. But for all of those who
are just watching this because, you know, you read
some news article or, you know, you heard about me from some news station, I just wanted to give you a quick montage of some other things I've done because, like, literally, this
isn't even the craziest thing I've done. - What on earth? My mom's not even answering. Pick up the phone, Mom. $35,000 donation, this is unreal. What is happening? Oh my God, oh my God. Wait, MrBeast just donated another 9,000. - We're gonna give her 15
seconds on a stopwatch. Every time she blinks is $1,000. All right, let's see this. - That's one. - Yeah, right there. Two. She got two. All right, it's been 15 seconds. Hey, wow, that was fast. - Oh my God! No way. - What's up, guys? We have tons of money
right here, like, $20,000. We have a drone. Drone 'em. Yep, we're gonna drop money from the drone on completely random people and yeah, this is going to be interesting. - What the heck? - Eric, my whole life, everyone's told me, "Money doesn't grow on trees." Like, what do you say... what is this? - Seriously, dude? What the heck? - I know, dude. I'm tired of people lying to me.
