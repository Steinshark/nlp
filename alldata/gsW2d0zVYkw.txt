what's that so that's paul's last words is you just go to church you know find an estuary or at least some club like a knitting club or something like you know be connected with people build your family ships with people that's right learn to learn to build relationships with people because again my sense is with a lot of younger people like you're right when we were growing up you were just with people there wasn't any of these screens to be with people through or to have this deceptive form of community and those are skills you need to learn to develop and it's a lot better than having a six-pack or being your ideal weight or getting some great degree or some you know some uber great job the the the skill of interpersonal relationship is the most one of the most important skills you can develop in your lifetime and there's no other way to do it but by doing it with people in real life this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world [Applause] [Music] so how do we it so let's just say hi to everybody because we don't know it's like we don't know how to introduce it conversation with you paul and jonathan yeah we we the thunder bay conference is coming up where john vervicky jonathan and i are going to be meeting with another professor from um from thunder bay that's coming up in september i've got this trip that i leave next uh less than a week from now for europe trying to sort of gather and strengthen the estuary groups and i'll be talking to a bunch of people and so i asked john and jonathan to meet john is traveling today so he couldn't meet and what well why don't we why don't we talk about well why don't we talk about the status of the conversation i put out a video uh last week when i got back i had some personal vacation time that i was taking and then i listened the the video dropped of your conversation with john and david fuller which i thought was a terrific video and i also thought that your conversation with jordan and john to me that that conversation felt like okay we're sort of getting things back on track in some ways almost all the way from 2018 you me and john have sort of kept um pecking away at this jordan's kind of been on the outside i thought your conversation with jordan right when he got back was outstanding but how i mean where do you see we were talking about consciousness that's what the conference in thunder bay is going to be about we're talking about attention i thought jordan's conversation with ian mcgill chris was very interesting i haven't watched yours with him yet um so where do you see well let's talk about the conversation then let's talk about the embodiment so where do you see the state of the conversation right now well the first thing to say too is that the conversation that jordan just put up with john viveki and the conversation that happened with david fuller those two parts those were filmed like two days like on this oh like one day after the other and so there's like a there's a through line in terms of the conversations there's a you know there's there's a not a mood but there's there's a lot of things boiling that we ended up covering you know both in the conversation with jordan then also in our conversation together because we record actually recorded this conversation with jordan first and then the other the next the conversation that came out uh earlier we recorded after so some of it was actually going back over some of the things we talked about with jordan um and so i think that i think that things are moving at least to me things are moving in the right direction and you know i also did some discussions with some more cognitive scientists ian and renato uh castrop and also don hoffman to to kind of see if the ideas that we're playing with in terms of in terms of first of all the the primacy of attention also in terms of what you could call the levels right i think that's how you talk about it the idea of a fractal relationship between these different levels so kind of self-same structures that embody themselves uh embed themselves into each other um if those make sense to them like if they make sense to these other cognitive scientists and the answer is yes like it really there seems to be although you know in both of my discussion with with don and with bernardo for example there were some things that that kind of scraped a little bit you know the don hoffman's idea of like the vr glasses like he doesn't see he doesn't have this sense that john verbaki for example talked about beauty as revealing he also he sees it completely as a as a almost like a lie like as if our experience of the world is this lie and i was trying to push him to say like okay well then what like you know so so i think that i think that everything is kind of moving along and what i'm noticing is that more and more people are understanding what the subject is they're understanding what it is that we're talking about they're also understanding this question of level i think most people understand that now and how attention let's say something like the highest form of attention is something like worship that one a part of the highest form of attention is something like sacrifice that sacrifice and worship are related um and that that is what creates bodies and that it's not just about something that happens mentally is that the sacrifice of attention the sacrifice of worship creates the body in which we then move you know uh and so so i think that that's i think that that's where we are that most people would kind of understand that and understand that it it happens individually in you right it happens at it at in terms of families in terms of teams in terms of the church and also happens in parasitic ways sometimes when we talk about when we talk about demons or parasitic processes that are both individual and social or at larger scales that we can see this these we can most people now i think not most people may i don't know most people at least a good group of people understand what this is about and it can now make sense of something like angels and demons and a lot of the language that is in scripture in a way that doesn't seem arbitrary to them that seems now like okay this is actually this is not just like a declaration of someone who says he saw god and god told him to say something and now he says it now this is saint paul is describing reality in ways that are extremely powerful and that if we can just have the key to what he's saying that it it's it's as relevant as anything these cognitive scientists are saying so i think that i hope that's where we are maybe it's more of a hope that i'm expressing well i i think i think at least those who are following these conversations um i think people are getting you know even even the way in which we grasp or appropriate this knowledge is is not um the way in which we in a modernist frame imagine what knowledge is and how we appropriate it i don't know if that makes any sense because i think you know when i look at what's not just information it's not just you can't just get it from accumulating information there's a there's a change that happens it has to happen like a like a you know a conversion we could say you know in a small c conversion that needs to happen or else people will think and you've seen it like people are some people are saying oh there it's all gibberish what they're saying is just a bunch of gibberish because they listen they hear but they don't because they can't see the how what it is what it is that you have to change your world view but basically to really understand it and that's not a mental process it's something which is actually precedes mental processes it's like a insight an intuition it's a i don't know it's it's a vision yeah and i think so you know i when i listen to these conversations i always try to see if i can translate it into terms that people who maybe didn't go to college or i mean the kind of people that i preach to on a regular basis in church um i the video i just put out this morning i've been looking at oliver sax's work and he had a really lovely chapter on the simple and um the the simple are those who can't do abstraction but they very clearly live in the world of the concrete and i i was struck in listening to that chapter in his book the man who um who mistook his his wife for a hat um there's a there's a level here of of practicality and so so okay i look at this and i hear i mean someone like nate up in the uk saying oh this is just gibberish and i talked to him on twitter a little bit this and i probably will talk to him again about it but i i think it's i think still in sort of a modernist world view people look at this conversation and think well this will help me get what i want instead of understanding that this will change what you want yeah yeah that's a great way to say it this will change what you think is good what you think is beautiful and what you think is true and it's actually at that level of transformation that uh we do need to be changed and i i think i think part of what's powerful in let's say having these conversations with with john verveiki with jordan and with let's say david fuller is that in some ways um you know because these individuals are are on the different side of the the christian line let's say in some ways that i think for the church i mean where i come at this thing is as a preacher intelligibility is key and what's been happening for the last 200 years in a lot of ways is that we've seen the church accommodating to modernity and trying to do that translation through it and now i think we're beginning to see it from the other side where there's at least been enough of a sea change that the church can point to things that are not modern they might be older than modernity and they include things that are now coming after modernity but the church can begin to make intelligible for me it's it's making the bible intelligible again actually because that's that's my main job as a preacher to make the bible intelligible and the more i you know the deeper i got into lewis let's say and you know part of the reason his book miracles has been i i i it to be quite honest i remember seeing jordan peterson and i'd seen something there that was in the biblical series and then in his classroom lectures i said wow this is really helpful in because i've been reading c.s lewis's book miracles like two three times a year for a couple of years wow to sort of combat modernity in me because i just i just felt myself increasingly becoming a reductionist modernist and i knew part of me knew in my formation that this was this was untenable this this this this doesn't fundamentally work and so then when i was listening to jordan i was connecting it with some of what lewis was saying in that in that book miracles and i thought boy jordan should really read this book and then i thought i could send him the book but that's pointless so then i thought what i really have to do is i shouldn't really worry so much about jordan but i should i should address his audience and so that's that's really how this thing got started for me now part of the irony and and sometimes frustration and all of this sort of thinky talky space which i think is essential and i obviously participate in it and we have that at the conference but part of the reason i'm so excited about the conference coming up in thunder bay is exactly what john said at the end of your conversation with jordan and john and is that and what jordan said too is that when we're having these conversations in the same room when we're physically together i i get a sense that you can make more progress that you're actually the physicality the embodiment you're actually making more progress in these areas that let's say the words on a page or the speech captured in a video can't fundamentally capture i think you're absolutely right and i mean my experience of when i went to toronto and spent those two days with john viveki for example i felt like our conversation really jumped quite really jumped a lot a lot farther i like i finally understood what he meant when why at least i finally understood at least why he resisted the the notion of narrative as being let's say the basic substructure and why he why he and so i finally got it like okay i understand because there is this basic ontological hierarchy which is not let's say a narrative and you see it like the story of moses is the best example right so it's like the law is not a story right it's it's i still like how can i say this like i still think that it's it's it's anchored in the story but i think that there's a there's an importance to this order of beings that we have to attend to and so it's like i was like oh i finally understand why or at least what he's what he was trying to get to when we were talking so to me that was a massive breakthrough um and also i think the more we've been discussing about beauty and with has been a massive breakthrough those conversations as well so i'm really excited for sure to to be with people but not just not just you guys although i'm looking forward to seeing you guys it's also just having people around that are that are interested that are curious and you know having informal moments of discussion and sitting around a table at dinner and those things are very precious you know we luckily now we you know with kovid you know with kobit uh let's say i would say i won't say ending but at least with covid not being an issue anymore you know we have that at the parish again like we have it in our church we have coffee hour and we have that camaraderie and that that communion but that is so precious i mean that has so much value to to to be able to be with people and to exchange and it's funny that we'd say that as if it's not a normal thing to do but it's become very it's become almost exceptional because we're so caught up in this this online space you know well and and yeah i love how earlier you talked about body and of course in in christian terminology that's that's christian language when we gather together on sunday or during the week or in our homes or let's say in an estuary group we are we are creating we are creating body uh we have the body politic political parties are have you know our bodies um i mean that's the language that obviously paul started in yeah you know in corinthians and that has permeated the western world it's completely you know under betting our politics and i think you know my my questions and and my desires when i okay so i'm watching you and john and jordan talk and david fuller you know i'm going to be in the uk i'm going to i'm going to get together with david i'm going to get together with justin we're going to have a bunch of estuary groups part of part of also what i what i really i think part of the challenge we face is is that of celebrity in that um we we see jordan you jonathan me perhaps to a degree and even though let's say in the early church i think church fathers bishops were in some ways celebrities you look at cyprian you look at augustine um i don't think this i think this dynamic of celebrity has everything to do with attention but i do think that the goal of for me the goal of all of this stinky talky stuff has to be knitting people together into bodies yeah that because i think we are we are far more transformed by our how we are in these bodies than we are through the the fire hose of abstracted talk that is coming at us into these things we're putting on our ears or into our eyeballs yeah i i mean that's why i always that's why i tell people go to church in the sense that i think that yeah this has to hit the road like it and it it's also it's also what makes what we're talking about real in the sense that i'd say my like my brother and i's notion of symbolism is obviously embodied it's not something which is just floating up there and i think also that the manner in which john viveki talks about relevant realization he doesn't see it as just a mental process he sees it as an embodied reality right uh move moving in space and and encountering things so so i think that we're not let's say that we're not gnostics and it's very important and that's also one of the things that will make this this project whatever it is will make it successful because it is trying not in the ways that the more that the that the rationalists and the modernist thought but it is trying to bridge the word of the world of phenomena with the say these spiritual ideals it's but it's not doing it through chemistry or like you know like the way that the weird ways that that people have tried to do it uh like creationism or that kind of stuff but it it's trying to do it in a still really in an embodied way so it's it's it's connecting your experience to your daily life to to these higher understandings and so and that like it scales right it's not just you and it it has to it has to embody itself in your family and in the intermediary communities and in church and you know one of the things that jordan for example has said is the best thing you can do right now is like you know clean your room and become a better person but there's also the scaling there's also because one of the problems of the modern world or the contemporary world is that it you know there's an extreme of chaos and an extreme order is the best way to understand it you have you how you see the states and these these organizations even corporations becoming more and more powerful more of more authority they could say coercive and and and authoritative and also permeating your space and then we see the people becoming reduced to their idiosyncrasies as much as possible like to your little thing and so a normal world when we talk about these embedded hierarchies the normal world is mediated all the way through and and it's interesting paul because i've been thinking about this in terms of exodus for example it seems like that's something one of the things that's going on in exodus where god is like god is this raging fire like god will destroy everything you know and then the people are in egypt and you know it's they're all scattered you know they're a bunch of slaves they're mixed multitude and god's like okay i want to make you to a people but if i if i co if if if i connect with you it's just going to burn you so we have to create this mediating structure between and it's it's both the law but it's also the the structure of uh of authority of the the you know the thousand the hundred the tense the whatever the fifty the tens that gets set up so you get this mediating reality of small embedded structures in each other it's like that's how it works that's how it works but the modern world wants to reduce have all this power up here and reduce us to individuals so one of the best things you can do and it's just like is really go to church or join a team or be part of an actual group of people that are working together you know that that are that are together towards a common attention and it's a normal thing for humans to do but it's something which has been made harder by covid by by the internet by you know getting caught up in these these online spaces so so it really is embodying this stuff at different levels in a family in in the church and in a group is the is necessary or else it's not going to have fruits it's not gonna yeah well i think one of the key elements of this is the very anti-modern i i think you said it very well the individualism the the anti-modern practice of commitment i think i mean john talks about transcendence i don't think there's any more powerful self transcendence than the the sacrificial burden of a costly commitment um you you that happens when you let's say you marry because you you say okay i'm sure that if i live another 50 60 years after this marriage i will find another um attractive person that i think is better for me than you um i am sure that i am going to find jobs and opportunities that will take me away from you and and so in a commitment you say you know in in the old english vowels forsaking all others it's like well you're going to do that in your 20s you know think about all of the optimization you're going to turn your back away from for the sake of this and and so then it then with children it becomes even more because children are these little you know they start out these little parasitic blood suckers that they take all your money they take all your time they take all your attention they you know they're just such greedy little things but if you actually devote yourselves to them and you pour yourself into them then they actually grow up and they thems themselves can become you know people who uh people who love and give and sacrifice for others so it's this it's this dance that creates but um i think part of part of what this what what this depends upon is the the making and keeping of commitments and especially i think i think the orthodox church has seemed i don't know i don't really know the church much but the orthodox church has seemed to maintain some of that better than at least in a lot of protestant churches now commitment is sort of the complete opposite of consumerism where consumerism is i'm going to act on what i perceive my best interest is now and the moment that i perceive those interests and desires changing i'm going to hop to the new thing yeah i'm gonna hop to the new partner i'm gonna hop to the new job i'm gonna and there's a degree to which you know when it comes to uh where you buy your things or that level is appropriate for a bunch of things in life but if that then becomes connected if that's the way you approach everything in life and i think you know even you know i've talked about about my channel before the the churn i mean youtube understands that okay you're watching vander clay now you're watching pejo now you're watching peterson now you're watching viveki now youtube doesn't care who you watch yeah just that you watch yeah yeah so i you know i think even though on one hand we're certainly making use of this medium i think we do our audience a disservice if we don't continue to remind them that it's going to be in having in real life commitments to one another and a face-to-face way all of this talk about self-improvement self-transcendence none of that is going to happen if you don't if the if the tyranny of the individual isn't broken and the the most obvious breaking of that is by keeping making and keeping commitments that makes sense that's that i think that's true and also the idea that commitments you have scale of commitments that's super important too because one of the issues so when you were talking i was thinking you know there there are right now let's say cults that will understand that and they use that they weaponize it right so they they actually demand so much commitment from you they demand supreme commitment and then in doing that and so you think why would anybody join a cult right and it's actually because people know that it's fulfilling to to be committed to something and to kind of give yourself to it uh and so cults will weaponize that and so you can recognize the difference between a cult and a real commitment uh whereas a cult or a parasitic type of relationship like that will demand all from you right we'll demand all and will see any other commitment you have as competing with whatever commitment you give them uh and so that's a good way for just people watching or listening to know the difference and you so you know it's like even in your relationship like if you you're in a relationship with someone with let's say a man with a woman and then that person wants you to give up all your friends and give up your family and give up give up you know and and renounce your your parents and everything it's like okay well no like that's not that's not a good relationship that's a bad relationship that's a you know the only thing that you know that's why we have the idea of god like god is the only one who can demand all our commitment and then thankfully he gives it back to us in in in fractal participation right in marriage in churches and in friendships and all of that so so that's one way to see the difference but you're right that if we find these these healthy places to to commit ourselves then then that's that's how yeah that's how that's one of the embodied ways that we can deal with the meaning crisis what what do you hope what do you hope for people who now i talked to catherine and i they've sold about 100 tickets they had 60 airsoft tickets and apparently jonathan john and i are all going to participate in the airsoft which and i fully expect that we are going to get pegged that's right more than anybody else just by virtue of hierarchy of attention and you also by virtue of a hierarchy of scale like you're just gonna be so much taller than all of us that everybody's gonna be shooting at paul we're gonna get massacred yeah but in terms of um in terms of the people well i i very much want people to come to this conference and i think i think there will be for for those who are watching online who can come to this concert now i realize that thunder bay is a difficult place to get to yeah if you're in a commitment though paul it's a commitment that's right it's a commitment if you're i am not actually my first one i looked at air flights i first looked at okay i gotta fly got like two steps into toronto then i'm gonna spend the night then i gotta get to thunder bay and i decided no i'm going to have one flight over to minneapolis and then we're going to do a road trip from minneapolis up to uh up to thunder bay because it's only about five hour drive from from from minneapolis and minneapolis for those you know say flying from other places in the world uh who can get into america which is not always easy um but those who are in the united states who want to get to thunder bay i would very much recommend get to minneapolis and then get up from minneapolis to thunder bay what do you want for people who listen to your channel and have been let's say how can i say this because i don't because again i don't think what we really want is fans i know i one of the great things about this conference that i'm looking forward to is that we're there for several days and so and it's also going to be limited you know they have a limit of people that can come so it's like i think they said 300 would be the limit but they're thinking more like 150 maybe uh you know 200 people and so it's like 200 people if you spend three days together two days together it's not the same like you have time to well you know we'll eat we'll sit we'll talk there'll be a lot of breathing room and so i think that that will be in some ways very refreshing compared to you know the one-stop evening uh you know presentation and then a few questions at the end uh that's really what i'm looking forward to really is to have just time and to and yes as to end with you and with john and to to be let's say to have to be able to talk with you and john and have other people sitting around that are that are chiming in that are that are giving their their ideas um yeah that's what that's definitely what i'm looking most forward to and i think that it will it will i think it will cement and i think people will create relationships there as well like because a lot of them say the zimbabwe people are the estuary people they meet online but yeah going there meeting in the flesh spending a few days together that will definitely cement and i definitely see people visiting each other and then calling each other afterwards and staying in touch that would that's definitely what i hope yeah that's that's what i hope for too and the the thing that i've appreciated most over these last four years has been i'm trying to get rick to go now rick's going to listen to this he's going to it's really he's got to get a passport first but um but even even the idea of going to minneapolis you know carpooling doing a road trip together as a minister i've often found that um car time with people yeah in our culture is really valuable because you know the cell phone doesn't work that well um you're in a car you're just you're in that confined space for a number of hours with people you you can gain a level of fellowship of personal knowledge you can find people that you actually click with and can maybe you know build longer friendships you know friendships again i just saw a video someone was saying that generation z is the loneliest generation which is you know astounding given the fact that we're all running around with these little devices in our pocket that it supposedly connects us to the world the quality of that connection is is weak no for sure yeah kids don't right now kids don't see each other a lot they they they are they're on instagram or on snapchat or whatever sending each other photos and and writing text but they there's hard you know it's not i notice it like even my kids they actually my kids see a lot of their friends maybe more than a lot of people but they still i feel like you know when we were kids during the summer you would you would spend all day with their people like you just go you would leave in the morning and then you just spent all day with people and then you come back home and that's not the case like it's not it might be happening somewhere but it's definitely not happening around here uh so it's just so so you're right these friendships are going to become more and more going to become more and more precious as time kind of kind of moves forward and we'll have to be deliberate about it we can't just think it's going to happen well and i also think a lot of the the self-improved so there's a there's a lot of this sort of self-improvement stuff on the internet right now and in some ways we're sort of adjacent to that given clean up your room and you know jordan's sort of in a self-help thing yeah his couple of his books but i think and a lot of that focuses on well eating better and cleaning your room and having a better job i suspect that part of what's going on with gen z is that they haven't developed the interpersonal skills to really build lifelong relationships with one another because the only way you can actually build those skills is to be with people just spend a lot a lot of huge amounts of time with people exactly and learn that talking in a certain way or talking about certain things that doesn't really progress the conversation and then learning how to read the subtle cues from someone else to engage in a conversation and you know as jordan says you engage in the conversation in order to have a next conversation and another conversation and to allow the relationship to go deeper and to be more stable and and so i i think that i i think that part of you know all of these skills are there they're basically necessary for having a a satisfying church life a satisfying romantic relationship a satisfying relationship with a parent or a child or a cousin or a sibling and you know it sounds i i hope that if people are there's a lot of digital i won't call them digital nomads i won't call them digital monks i'll call them digital recluses for the digital recluses to get out from behind the screens and be in a car with people and have to do all of that difficult work of learning to relate build a relationship build a friendship maintain a friendship um feed a friendship because i think all of this is actually the knitting that builds these bodies that we're talking about definitely and so what about you in terms of the estuary because you're doing this little estuary tour tell me a bit about that you're going you're going to europe uh and and so so who are these people like how many are there it's it's hard to know um so i am doing a bunch of um more conferency type things so in this all got started because the german estuary decided they wanted to do a festival and so they've got a band called two more v's well two more v is gonna be there yeah yeah i know i know so two more visas gonna do music and they got burn power coming over from tbilisi georgia wow and i'm and then um [Music] um matea said to me he said you know well if we paid your way would you come and i thought yeah i'd come and then john vindonk was like well if you're going there anyway why don't we make it a big thing so the the german festival started it out and then the hollanders got together and said you know well let's use that to kick off our dutch estuary the netherlands is small enough that you know people can get around pretty easily so i'm talking to a guy who was their national theologian and a journalist and another philosopher so we're doing a conversation there i think we're having another um estuary type group there so we're going to launch a couple of dutch estuaries the german estuary has been going well so they're going to have a festival and they want to make that a yearly thing one of the things i was just in chicago one of the things that i've been noting is that these estuaries like the chicago estuary they meet together quite regularly but every year now they're doing a bigger event okay draw a little bit more attention and organize themselves and give them sort of a project that they can push themselves to and i think that's pretty helpful so i'm meeting with some theologians in the netherlands and then the german festival and then john van donk and i are taking a train through switzerland through france under the tunnel all the way to the uk yeah um and then i'm going to go up to ireland northern ireland and i'm going to do an event with um marcus yeah that's so amazing i'm so jealous of that like i would oh man you're making me so jealous yeah it's going to be a little bad so tickets i've got the i'll put the links below for these things you can still get tickets for that and then i come back down to london and i'm doing an event with um with glenn scrivner and tom holland nice whoa this amazing paul that's gonna be wonderful so i think there might still be uh things available for that and then i'm preaching in a little church in london that's actually one of the things i'm most excited about preaching at church in london oh yeah there's a little church and i and the church writes me but we're a little church i've got a little church i much prefer a little church because we can see each other yeah and so i'm preaching in a little church in london and then we've um i'm going to meet with justin brierly a little bit and i'm going to meet with david fuller and i'm going to have another estuary meeting in salisbury i think there's a few other estuary meetings that are going we're going to have a meeting in manchester just an estuary group and i hope uh i hope nate um comes down for that because uh nate's been uh nate's been critical and i i you know the book of proverbs talks about the fact that in many ways you know our critics can be a blessing because they can open us up to maybe things we're not seeing so i think um i think i'll i'll have a good time nate and i have talked he's he's he's one of the few guys that managed to get himself banned twice from the bridges of mean discord surfer he had joe ban him but um but you know as a pastor i deal with that you know you're always dealing with sheep that behave badly so i have a i have a heart for sheep that behave badly that's amazing that sounds like so it's all going to be recorded most of it it's going to be i'll i think the bigger events are going to be recorded i don't know we'll have to see and then we're also hopefully so there's another guy who's been talking about he's a hollywood um cameraman and he was just down in greece filming a sequel to the big fat greek wedding okay and he's gonna come up and he's actually been talking about um thinking about doing a documentaries that he teaches documentary filmmaking at biola and he's starting to think about what would what would a documentary look like focusing on this little corner of the internet well that'd be interesting because there's a lot of attention going to jordan but um i i'm i'm more excited by what i hope we're knitting together with me and you and john and estuary and i you know part of what estuary for me is about from a church perspective is that churches you know church has to continue to do what church does but there's been a there's been a gulf between the church and the culture and there are a lot of fundamental misunderstandings about what church is and what church is for yeah and and there's a lot of you know given given the history of church in the west and perhaps to the east in the eastern church as well there's a lot of anxiety among non-churched people about churches at a cult is it uh is it something that's tyrannical yeah and um i think i think anybody who's you know there certainly are tyrannical churches and tyrannical pastors for sure but anybody who's had a living healthy relationship in a church should understand that church is fundamentally not tyrannical we talked about making and keeping commitments that's a making and keeping commitments is a different thing from a tyranny that's right it's hard because some people today let's say might think that that's that that's it like a lot of people seem to think that just authority itself any authority is is immediately tyrannical but that's not usually that's not especially in a church because the thing about a church is that it's not you're not um especially now like there's no one compelling you to go to church and so it's a negotiation like even if there is real authority it's always going to be a negotiation because it's not like uh not like there are any consequences to you not going to church especially now so yeah and and and yet well i i thought your conversation i think it's with glenn when you talked about authority i i'd love to hear you talk more about authority in some of these venues because so my wife is an elementary school teacher and she is she's she's in a waldorf program so she went um first grades first through eight with her class i remember that first class that she sort of graduated i mean those kids gosh those kids would those kids would do anything for her because what she did through those eight years was she's very demanding she runs a very tight ship in terms of that classroom but she can do that because she pays very close attention to each of them as an individual and the kids very quickly pick up that she wants what's best for them yeah and so it's not tyranny it's love yeah yeah but it you can see it like there's also i mean i think everybody's had that experience in school i remember my best teachers were actually not like the the the just the nice teachers the ones that are just trying to buddy up to you and to you know they're actually the teachers that were both demanding and strict but involved and caring so it's like you know they they will put in the work they'll put in the time they will pay attention they'll listen to you they'll listen to your question they'll take them seriously but you better step up and you know so there's a sense in which it's a though that seems to be at least in terms of authority understanding that for sure if authority doesn't love then that's not how it works right i mean saint paul sets it up pretty clearly it's like the authority has to love and then the the the the people that are submitted to that authority have to submit but it's a it goes both ways right it's like if you don't you can complain let's say you can be an authority and you can complain that nobody's listening to you if you you know but and you can say well they should you know this is god's way like they should listen with like okay you can say that as much as you want but it's still not going to work it's not going to happen so so i think yeah the question of it and just i mean i think it has to do with hierarchy people don't understand also that hierarchy is always negotiation not in a bad way not in the sense of like a like a fight or some kind of conflict but it's a negotiation in the sense that whatever thing wants to find body has to deal with the body it's going to find right it's like a maple tree growing in a in let's say on a rock won't has to negotiate its body out of what is possible for it so the the structure of a tree will be related to the soil in which it is and that is just a natural relationship between the pattern and its instantiation and that is true for any type of of hierarchy any type of authority there is a negotiation between the pattern and the structure and the and the potential that will instantiate it there's there's no way around it's not never just top down top down is not is not at least not i don't think there's any way to argue that top down is the christian way of seeing the world like it's a it's a it's a call-in response like the song of songs that's why that's why you know the fathers see the song of songs as this relationship between god and man but you can see it fractally as this relationship between authority and those that are submitted to it as this as this call and response of two lovers that respond to each other and want to come together so well i think that's why we want to create bodies that i think that's why we meet together because you know the attention the love part of the part of the i remember once you saying that you know these screens and people looking at us right now we are beings of light but we are in that way the screens are deceptive yeah because um myself you john verbaki jordan peterson any of us if you meet us in person part of you is going to definitely be disappointed that's right that's for sure we will and and one of the huge disappointments that i think the deceitfulness of their these technologies are a blessing but there's a deception in them yeah in that right now this is a very immediate relationship that oh i i feel like paul gets me i don't get you at all i don't see you at all i'm looking at a camera and a screen here and i've even you know i haven't even gotten to know john and jonathan beyond you know conversations less than one on one hand that's not real knowledge no yeah um and i've certainly listened to them plenty and thought about them in germs but but the you you cannot really form a body uh a durable life-giving authoritative yet loving body without you know immediate relationship and just by virtue of the dunbar number i think part of what made jordan so powerful especially in those early years was that he was able to connect both he had authority and people would again and again say that to me oh he's you know he speaks as one with authority oh okay i've heard that before um but partly because it on one hand he he was able to make a um a credible demand of people that people could say yeah i should clean my room yeah i i'm sponging off my parents i'm i'm wasting my life that's a credible appeal and a credible challenge but at the same time you'd see him when he was talking about the loss of humanity that let's say someone living in their mother's basement covered and covered in cheetos dust doing video games and porn all the time you know when he would break down into tears about such a person you saw then that mixing of challenge and care and love but and the screen sort of said well he cares about you well to the degree that you're participating in in the fraternity of porn and cheetos dust perhaps but that's not much of a fraternity to be a that's not much that's not a good body to be a part of no um yeah well it's a spark like it's a it's a spark that can lead you to into something real which is why i think like it's i mean i think that both of us have have had different ways of going about it like i think the estuary that definitely seems to be what you're trying to do is saying okay well we need to get this to land you know uh and and i'm focusing more on the church idea but the estuary is like an intermediary space like a space of you know a bubbling space of discussion and exploration that i think is also super necessary right now and part of for me estuary always has two problems one of it is i'd love people to form groups make a body participate in it commit to it figure out how to make that a life-giving life life-producing network of relationships but the other part for me is admonishing the churches to say look why aren't you doing that yes why is it that no one imagines a church would be a good place to go to in order to get into a body that you know that has these kinds of conversations i see what you've done in terms of your symbolic world in a rather estuary way so you have here you have the church fathers here you have the church but you are translating that and trying to make it intelligible via symbolism to a much broader audience and and and some have figured that out and then found their way into the church um i you know as a preacher that's always in a sense been mine but i've seen the church as so at least the protestant church in some ways has was so formative of modernity and especially in the 19th 18th and 19th century they they thought they could basically retranslate the bible into into science and yield of technology that would i mean there's there's a real difficulty in protestantism there yeah and yet for you know that people say well why are you still protestant well because i'm committed to a body i'm committed to i'm committed to lots of bodies these are my people and so um at one point someday you and i are gonna have to have a longer conversation about the protestant reformation which which would be absolutely fun but um yeah i also do it in private with like a glass of beer and you know or bourbon and cigar or something which was exactly what lewis said lewis said protestant reformation should have been a conversation of that nature rather than what it ended up being so so yeah so there's there's so there's thunder bay coming up and there's my europe trip are you are you doing any anything look there's a lot of stuff i mean there's a lot of stuff coming up it's all none of it is super clear like i it's i mean people have noticed that i've been that jordan peterson has kind of kind of taken me along i guess is the way to say it he's like all right jonathan let's go there let's do this and i'm like okay sure why not like i'm you know i love it uh we did this this uh we did this 10 year 10 day seminar on exodus uh which was great which a lot of fun we didn't finish the book we actually got to the law basically in 10 days which is crazy but you know it was a lot of it was like a wild conversation uh dennis frager was there and then greg hurwitz stephen blackwood for people who kind of followed jordan have seen him uh and uh james orr from the uk so it was it was great it was wonderful um and so i'm probably i'm probably going to the uk in september okay so there might be some events there but it's nothing is clear yet so okay so at least for now it's like it's thunder bay people come to thunder bay so this this seminar on on exodus any of this recorded or was this pretty much it's all recorded oh no it was recorded like daily wire recorded it was it was like you know with five cam six cameras and lighting and the set and and makeup and it was like it was so like another world i like being in another world but i mean it was it was great it was wonderful like i really i did enjoy my time there and a lot of down time also with all these people you know just chatting and discussing and so that was great but uh but yeah it's definitely hype high production well i would love to see um because you know as a pastor i know you say okay people should oh i'm gonna start reading the bible they go through genesis like oh genesis was great and i go through exodus and you get the sinai and wow exodus is great and then after cyanide yeah we're not there yet i know i keep telling like okay you you we better like we'd better set up some some some notions or you better set up some structures of understanding how this is applicable right now because when we get to take a sword and cross the camp and slash as much as you can like when we get to kill all the you know it's like you we better have a way to understand this because like our ideals about freedom and whatever like all this stuff that people want to put into exodus and about like freedom from slavery and all this stuff like you better be ready because what's coming is rough and i think there's there's way there are ways to talk about it i think the church fathers have ways to to discuss it if we understand reality fractally then then the application that is made personally is not just a metaphor it's not just it's actually not just a like an arbitrary allegory that the fathers came up with it's actually applying the pattern of the story to yourself you know and then the sacrifices become self-sacrifices right the egyptian that you kill is the one in inside you and so it's a transformation of the interpretation into to the person and and then all of it can be applicable uh but unless we do that then good luck like good luck with the with the with the purging of the camp there fellows well not only that but also the the furnishings of the tabernacle yeah like how are you gonna understand any of that stuff right why all of these chapters god is giving detailed instructions on this is what the tabernacle is supposed to look like i mean it's it's almost like he's i always liking it sort of like that the tabernacle is sort of like a nuclear containment unit because what happens often is god breaks out into the camp and people die and and so the kind of attention given to the furnishings of the tabernacle the um the rituals it ends with the description of the tabernacle yes and so but that's the body like that's the embodiment that we're talking about it's like the final embodiment of all of this where it's leading to which is an embodiment of sacrifice and worship like that's actually the mediating so all the mediating principles are now in place in terms of the law and in terms of space and in terms of relationships of people and and relationships of authority all of this has now been established and now it's practiced it's right and people always think that the that what happens on sinai is just about a bunch of moral code you're supposed to use like you said it's actually mostly about the tabernacle it's mostly about an order of worship an order of procession right a manner in which we engage with each other in in in a in a ritual worship sacrifice sense that's actually what's probably the prime the prime drive of where we're going in terms of of of exodus so so but that's all related to what we're talking about it's very exodus is actually i'm really happy that we're doing exodus because exodus is really about the discussion that we're having now and understanding the relationship between the embodied practice which which instantiates these patterns that are that are above and that's what exodus is about the whole time and some of it does include you know having to remove the patterns or remove the things that don't fit and it looks weird in the text because it does look weird in the text it's like well yeah it's killing a bunch of people i understand that that's that's difficult but it's like you can either just be annoyed and angry and just just scream and shout fine or you could try to understand it and realize that you know whatever you get involved with that has this pattern you're gonna do that right it's like if you're if you're in a basketball team and then someone comes with a baseball bat you're going to say i'm sorry you need to go home because this is not what we're doing we have to purge you from this team because this is not it does not fit with the aim that we're that we're going to uh and so so unless we are able to to look beyond i mean i don't want to minimize the madness or some of the things that look really crazy to people in that book but if we want if we don't if we if we want to understand it then we need to to be able to to see how it what it what it's referring to in terms of a pattern and in terms of embodiment so anyways sorry but it's like we're not there yet because we're just at the law like we've just basically in in the the exit seminar we've come to the ten commandments and we've read the ten commandments and then that's it like we didn't even interpret them because so but there's already some of it like when you see moses going up you see the problem like when moses goes up the hill and then the people forget him and then they make the golden calf and it's like it's like okay so mo you know so because god says to moses your will be god to aaron right you will be god to aaron and then aaron will be your mouth to the people and so you can imagine it's like the hierarchy it's a hierarchy of manifestation so then moses leaves and then aaron makes a golden calf it's like that's how it works folks it's like if you don't stay connected then these things at the bottom become idols and so unless they're connected all through then that's what that's the problem that's when things become idols and so it's it already makes i think people are going to be able to people who watch our content like people who who listen to john or watch my videos and everything will be able to understand you know what what's going on in the books of exodus because it's all about that well i you know there's the there's definitely the problem of um let's say canaanite slaughter so we've we've got those issues but to me also the question is you've got the second half of the book of exodus which is all about furnishing in the tabernacle how does the tabernacle function and then you've sort of got the decalogue the ten words but then you've got all of these particular other little laws yeah and then of course that's going to lead to leviticus which is even more of that and then it's going to lead to deuteronomy which is sort of a i remember in seminary doing a little bit of a detailed study between the laws and exodus and comparable laws in deuteronomy and the changes between them of course that gets in biblical scholarship that gets into a whole thing but the i mean a lot of the heart of the conversation is okay how do we then live um because quite clearly the tabernacle and the more specific laws flow out of the exodus and the decalogue and it's all the application and i think you know part of what i would like to hear from you and from jordan and especially in conversation with others we have some um we have some some jewish um members in our bridges of meaning community um is okay how do we deal with you know okay you can't weave you know you can't wear a garment of two fabrics i mean all of that that's super easy to understand by the way paul yeah that was super easy but that's the low-hanging fruit yeah yeah um the temperature yeah why the tabernacle is set up the way it is like i i think that some of the details of the tabernacle i think are definitely obscure to me like there's some like you know the hoops and the like some of it becomes like okay like at least in terms of meaning like it seems like okay well you need hoops to hold the thing and that and i hate because we were like oh jonathan's saying just right transcendence just to hold the thing uh but i i just because i don't i don't totally enlighten but in terms of the basic structure of the tabernacle i think that it's extremely coherent in terms of uh in terms of an ontological hierarchy and it actually repeats the story in genesis it's actually it's it's almost a narrative repetition of the fall moving from the tree you know the candelabra let's say and the the the cherub on the altar so you have a little mini paradise and then you have bigger versions of it moving all the way to the to the garments of skin uh and then ultimately to the to the altar of the fire on the outside the fire and water on the outside you have the the lava and you have the so it's like you see it like it's an exodus right the fire the column of fire and the column of water in exodus are related to what you end up finding in the the the tabernacle a good way for people to understand it is that during the plagues those get mixed up it's like there's fire and water and it's destroying and it's all mixed and then god separates that into two guiding principles two pillars you could say and then those end up in ultimately in the tabernacle they also end up ultimately in the temple as yakin and boaz as the two pillars of the of the temple and so there's a structural element like to understand the structure the thing is i'm not sure one of the things i think i might do is because obviously this is a conversation between eight people and so you know i was you always measure like you're like okay when should i make it when should i make say something and i need to make it impactful i need to make it relevant one of the things i might do is when the exodus seminar comes out i might make my own exodus like good you know just to kind of say well if you like what i'm saying there and you like what jordan's saying there you want more like here's here's uh here's a bunch of videos that go through exodus as well so i'm thinking about doing that just because obviously some people are going to tell me like why didn't you say this like why didn't you i was like you know it's like you you're with eight people so you you you find the moment and you you try to measure your your your involvement so but it was fun it was a lot it was a lot of fun where did you do it in miami we recorded in miami oh did someone have a place in miami or was it just kind of a rented space that they use well daily wire daily wire they basically run out of two places out of nashville and in miami oh okay and so they rented us they have a staff studio they went there and they have a team that comes to film and so okay yeah well any idea when that's going to be released i think it's in november but i think it's for the daily wire plus i think that's what i that's my understanding there we go i got my i paid for my year because it was cheaper a month someone on twitter right away when that got announced someone had twitter this means paul vander clay's going to get a daily wire plus subscription i thought no i'm not going to do it it was a day later i bought it it's like why not i got to do it well i mean yeah because i mean some of the contents of these definitely i think i think they're going to do some some public some they're going to do both i don't know we'll see but i was happy that the conversation with you and john and jordan that that was completely on youtube um i was happy about that and i understand i i totally understand that for jordan you know i say this and sometimes sometimes people criticize me for saying it jordan had a life you know he had a life he was a clinical psychologist he was a university professor you know he did his little ontario public tv things and then he spoke out and his life was taken away from him yeah and so i don't begrudge him he he's got years left in him hopefully to to have a vocation and and so now he you know he like brett weinstein and you know they're kind of you know verveiki talks about domicide in terms of their vocation jordan peterson and and brett weinstein they were they were sort of kicked out of their professions and so now they're living in this intel you know public intellectual space and so i understand that youtube is not probably a stable reliable platform platform necessarily for him so i don't think that's something definitely to at least in the long term as things get like as things get closer to so now there's the midterms but when we get to the next election things are gonna get wild like things are gonna get so crazy like we have people don't like don't think that you've seen it all like it's gonna get really bad so in a way the people that aren't in some ways at least aware and preparing for that on on social media and then make it in this space where we're made using these these massive google and these massive companies to make content you know don't be naive it's going to get next election cycle's gonna get really bad so which again is why i think people need to be embedded in a body yeah and they need to have um you know when you look at rod drears latest book and when he talks about i mean what what you have when these mediating structures are sort of liquefied by the chaos that's going on what you really have are relationships of trust where you look across the way and say i trust this person and i trust this person not because they're saying all the things i want to hear but because i've been with them and i've watched them i've watched them live yeah and you know no none of us are completely trustworthy but we get a sense of what we can trust people for and what we can't and it's all that detailed real life connection that finally um that that you really need when um when chaos reigns so yeah yeah yeah what's that so that's paul's last words you just go to church you know find an estuary or at least some club like a knitting club or something like you know be connected with people build your family ships with people that's right learn to learn to build relationships with people because again my sense is with a lot of younger people like you're right when we were growing up you were just with people there wasn't any of these screens to be with people through or to have this deceptive form of community and those are skills you need to learn to develop and it's a lot better than having a six-pack or being your ideal weight or getting some great degree or some you know some uber great job the the the skill of interpersonal relationship is the most one of the most important skills you can develop in your lifetime and there's no other way to do it but by doing it with people in real life so there's my message that's great pastor paul has spoken thanks thanks this is great i definitely i'm looking forward to seeing you very soon looking forward to seeing you and and john too and and and you know i've you know i've gotten to know catherine and eamon who are setting up this conference they're great you know yeah they're quite well and so i really look forward to meeting with them in the flesh and yeah so all right have a great trip to europe too good place to land the plane yeah and uh i hope i if i can find intricate reliable internet connections from europe i hope to have you know unlike my vacations people people on my channel have been you know you're not putting out the content i'm used to well if i can find internet connections hopefully vendank and i will talk and

thanks a lot bye-bye bye-bye hello everyone i want to invite you to an event which will be happening from september 16th to the 18th in thunder bay ontario called consciousness and conscience it is going to be a conference where i will be there with uh john verveiki with paul vander clay and also with dr richard mondro for those who follow the uh this little corner of the internet you will see that this is the closest thing to a conference bringing us all together that we're going to have in a little while it is the closest thing to a symbolic world conference as well it's going to be several days of talks of discussions and it's even going to start a few days early on the 14th where we're going to have an airsoft and barbecue and it really shows you what is the the purpose of this conference is to to get together to discuss ideas to also get to know each other so i'm really excited to participate in this my own talk will be called love and attention and i'll be looking at the manner in which love binds together our attention and why i think that this is really the glue of consciousness in general and kind of one of the secrets to how reality presents itself to you and so but mostly really i'm looking forward to being there with you guys with paul vander clay who i've never met with john vivek who i always love to be together and discovering also dr richard monroe who
