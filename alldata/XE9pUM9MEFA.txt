- No! I don't wanna die. I don't wanna go. No. - See you on the other side, boys. Okay. - What's up, guys. Lego right into the video. - Shut up. - Hey, that kinda hurt, but
I still love you to pieces. - Shut up. - Are those Legos? - Yeah.
- Those are awesome. - Thank you. - Get ready to go.
- Three, two, one, go! Go faster!
- Yeah. - To sheetz! - To sheetz. And get a banana. - Their go-kart doesn't
seem to be working. - We've had zero problems until right now. - Their car fell apart. Know what? I got the solution, boys. Here's what we do. - What do we do? - Try it now, it should work. - All right. - Darn, I really thought that would. Come on. We built a Lego car. We can do it. Oh, this is not a good idea. - Not good, no, go. - This is such a bad idea. Woo hoo! All right, we're on the main road, boys. We're fulfilling our Lego dreams. You know, being normal. - Yep. - Ow. Hey, what's up man? Yo, come back here. Look.
- No! I don't wanna die. We almost died. - Not actually. - Sorry, we just had
to fill up real quick. One second. - Oh, we're like kids in a candy store. - You're good.
- Okay, back to work. - How do you get in? Oh, this is so cool. This is my new car. - It's totally built using only Legos. Nothing else? Like, so re the tires,
only Legos, right, guys? - It's a Lego tire, don't worry. Yeah. - That's cute.
- I would never lie to you, guys. - And it really like runs, like it's real. This is so cool. How long did it take
you guys to build these? - Like five minutes,
just threw 'em up there. - It said ages nine and up on the box. So it shouldn't be too hard. - It's gonna be put on Amazon. - I thought Lego cars were supposed to be fuel efficient, but this took 82 cents to fill up. - Unbelievable.
- What the crap, man? 82 cents?
- Get it together, Obama. - I know, right? You're not a Viking anymore. It is the big dude with a beard. - I have a name. - Big dude with a beard. - You're just jealous
you can't grow a beard. - Oh, oh, get after him. - Get back here. - That doesn't sound good. - Doesn't sound good. I hope they don't die. That would suck. - 'Cause insurance. - Well, then I wouldn't be
able to upload this video. - Yeah, you would. Then you could title
it my employee's gone. - Wrong, you're right, all right. - Ah!
- Ah! Push it! Grab that!
- Ah! - You know some old mom has
called the cops already. There's two guys in Lego cars
driving down the highway. - I had to tap my brake. We're being passed! Hey, what's up? How you doing? Chris, your head's in the way? - Good. - Got the **** out the way. We're now on the sidewalk. He was not having that ****. - There's not a lot of room here. There's not a lot of room. - He got stuck at a red light. What did Chase fall in? Hey, what's up fam? - Hey MrBeast, I love
your YouTube videos, dude! - Yeah!
- Thank you. - Good content, man. - Yeah!
- Yeah, thanks for holding up traffic for us. - Hey!
- Yeah. Yeah! - Are we about to drive
past the police station? - Yeah, the police station's coming up. - Yeah, we're literally about to drive past the police station. - This is dangerous and illegal. Hey! Where'd you go? - Oh God. - Oh! Go right by, go right by. Hey, hello.
- How are you doing? - We made it. - We're alive, captain. So much for fun on the sidewalk. All right, we might have a... - Cop, cop, cop, cop, cop! Get over here. There's a **** cop. - We're done. We're done. - Cameraman] No, we're good. - Hey! - She didn't notice. - What? - A cop just drove by
and didn't do anything. - Those ding dogs are like let's be super reckless
at this exact second. - I know, right? We're like, "Cop, cop!" And they're just like, "What?" - What? Drive more reckless and
draw more attention? - Excuse me.
- Don't mind our Lego car. - Excuse me. Visit once, no big deal. - Hey.
- Hello? - Is this Florida? - Yeah.
- Okay, sweet. - You're here. - Yeah.
- Florida State. - Florida State University.
- Do they have anything out there? - Sweet. Oh, look, a cow. Look, it's the cow. Welcome to the south. - Ah!
- Oh no. Oh God, Chris. Oh, that's a bump. Oh, I saw, we all saw it. - I didn't see that. There was a whole squad of us. And then we just started
driving through the campus and we lost all our
friends and our comrades. - We're lost.
- Yeah. - He said me at Sup Dogs. - Okay.
- Oh, here we go. - We are like pioneers. The pioneers used to ride
these Legos for miles. - Oh God.
- Hey, excuse me, sir. Is Sup Dogs on this road? - Which way is Sup Dogs? - Well, I don't know,
but such a cool car, man. - Thank you.
- Thank you. All right, well, that's all we needed. We're gonna make-
- No left hand turns. - But we make our own.
- Right here, right here. Yeah, we can do it. - Can we fit.
- Make us fit. - It's good.
- Oh, okay. Oh, wait. Oh, okay. - Are we here?
- That was the journey. - Yeah, we're here.
- We as a squad, just went through hell and back. - Thanks for coming, Tyler.
- I'm all right. - I don't know where the hell
we are, but we did something. We just drove. No offense, Tyler, but can you
get the **** outta the car? I'm kind of like, I have no room. - What the hell is this ? - This is our car.
- Yeah. - Is it all outta Legos? - Yeah.
- Are these Legos? - This is Lego too. It's all Legos. Do you know where our comrade is? We lost him. - Actually, yeah, he's
over there by McDonald's. - Really? - They were like with a truck, they were running on the road. They were pushing it. - Hey!
- Hey! Hey! - You guys like our Lego car? - Yeah.
- Pretty awesome. - We built it this morning. - Yeah.
- Cool. - That's really cool.
- Thank you. - You like our whip?
- Sweet. - We built it ourselves.
- Foreign cars. - Built it.
- Yeah, Legos and screws. - Legos and screws.
- It was like $200. See it says butts, so that way you know
where to put your butts. Genius, right?
- Yeah. I know, I always forget where to sit. - Exactly. - We're gonna go eat. Can you not steal it while we eat? - Yeah, I got you guys, don't worry. You need me to stay
here and post up in it. - Yeah, like you're ripped? So like just like, no.
- Oh yeah, you know me. - No.
- Tyler, go try to steal it. Let's test him. - Yeah.
- Sir, sir, sir. - He got the bounced.
- He's a good one. - You're got bounced hard. - All right.
- Thanks man. - We trust you with this. - It's not here when we
get back from eating, boys. Riot against him. - So, you like our car?
- Oh, it's nice. - Yeah?
- Nice? I bought it for my daughter. - Now we're just gonna use it. - We stopped and got some food, but we're back on the road again. Our padres are back there. We're gonna go hit up a park. Our comrades, they broke down. Well guys, what happened? - I don't know, man. It's not-
- It's not working? - Trying to put the pieces
together, but it's broken. - All right, guys, hop in our whip. Hey, you like our whip? - Like our whip?
- I like it, man. - Thank you.
- What's up, man? - Not much. - Yeah, I look like
freaking Tom cruise, but- - No one thinks you look like Tom cruise. - I hear it all the time. I look like Tom cruise, right? - Yeah.
- See? - See? - She just said, yeah. That doesn't mean anything?
- I'm not lying. - See, she said, "I'm not lying." - I said I'm lying! - Oh.

- Yeah. Let me get in there.
- All right. Yeah! - Y'all are the coolest
people I've ever seen? - No, you're the coolest
people we've ever seen. - I love your car. I don't understand it, but I like it. - You you'll see it. You can ride in it if you want. - It looks so cool. I'm gonna take a picture

- That's a dark. - No. - Is it okay to be here? Pulled over here? - MrBeast! - Okay. - Get off it, please. - Yeah. - You have your license and
registration on you, sir? - I don't, I don't have
my wallet or anything. - Okay, so you don't have
any identifying information? - No, sir. - Is there any reason
why we were operating this vehicle on the road? - No, just filming a video, man. - But on street in the middle of the day? - We had to get it back. - Okay, stand tight for me. - All right. - Another one showed up. - Legos are dangerous, I mean, this is serious stuff. Forget people like robbing and stealing and killing right now. The Lego car is a priority. - Pretty impressive though, right? - Did you make it?
- Yeah. It's like 100 degrees out here and cops told us to stop
driving on the road. Lego lives matter too. Tego, what do you think? - Lego lives matter? - I know, right?
- What else is there to say? - I need every comment. Lego lives matter too. - They told me technically I
could have lost my license. So, thank you.
- Hell yeah. - Thank you for letting
me have a warning, guys. - We're done breaking the
law, for today at least.
