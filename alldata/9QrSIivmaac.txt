hexing the technical interview I'm gonna turn off alerts now here we go camera throb me camera throb me long ago on sveld when you were a young Witch of 43 your mother took your unscarred wrists in her hands and spoke vidrun born of the sea Wind Through the spruce vidran a green tinged offshoot of my bow Joy of my burden of life vidran Fierce and clever mayor Clan's wisdom be yours never read Hacker News this is great advice okay this is great advice this is why I make these YouTube videos is we take the 98 rating and you guys get out not  okay it's it's it's a hard job but somebody has to deal with it okay somebody has to do this uh but Hacker News has read of you in their snickery is Snicker slicing sticker slithering sirential Warrens I can't I do I can't say all these words together uh and word has spread which is why the young man offering you a smorgasbord of a micro kitchen Delights looks mildly suspicious already what was it what was the thing with Google a micro kitchen must be within how many feet of any engineer at any time did you hear this there's actually like they designed their campus around the smallest distance on average from any one engineer to micro kitchen Google truly is adult playground it is truly adult daycare we must not have these engineers get up and move okay okay Bonnie for when they get tired tired of code and give them food soon as possible that's a he who whisks you into a glass shoe box on a conference room which somehow manages to be claustrophobic despite the open Sun Lines the sight lines you make a mental note to avoid this conference room in the future but reassure the room is nothing it's a reassure the room it's nothing personal I have never reassured a room anything so my name is Tim and I'll be your first interviewer today Tim is making every effort to be cheery his ears slick a stick out a bit or tip you know why do you think I wear headphones okay you know what you know you don't want to see me catching air with these Dumbo ears uh and in the dark let's see and in his dark brown hoodie and cream t-shirt perched expectantly on the table he resembles something of a pine marten you like Pine Martens and therefore Tim as well okay before we get started is there anything I can tell you about the company by the way this is like this is cue for you to not be a dummy right I want you to know this when someone says this phrase if you are interviewing at a place and you're like no no like if there's an easier way to to get up to bat have a bat be put on a t-ball thing and then get handed a tennis racket and all you have to do is hit the t-ball and somehow you miss this is the time that you miss okay it's ridiculous don't don't be that person you would like to ask what kind of call Tim would make or were he guarding his cache of eggs and nuts against other Martin instead you giggle to yourself lean uh lean your sprig of cloud Pine against the corner and then settle comfortably uh to the floor Tim leans it in to get a clearer view of where you've gone definitely you think to yourself so um perhaps you could tell me a bit about uh your background he hasn't read your resume no man can this is fair this is actually Fair uh in the winter you begin above the ice locked fjards Liza Creek white ash white with the ghosts of glaciers you know what he interrupts it was a beautiful story but perhaps you can tell it later how about we do a little programming together just the basic exercises so I can get a sense of how you think that sounds nice Tim okay great Tim seems reassured to be back on track so let's open up an editor would you like would you would you like to have a seat come you Pat the ground next to him it is safer this way Tim stairs at the parrot the parenthesis of salt with disbeliefs shakes his head and reluctantly sits by your side Tim retells an old riddle though he does not know its Origins and has the words wrong a group of Travelers are lost in the woods upon the wind winding mountain path and worry that they have been Travelers in circles or traveling in circles they must know does their path lead to Freedom or constrain themselves to wander forever in the wilderness what a lovely story you know nothing makes me happier than when they add a really stupid story to a word problem how about you just tell me the problem you know like I'm not a kid you're an adult let's be adults you know when I have a problem with somebody unless if this is some sort of like Prophet Nathan's story to Daniel or David I am not telling a story right that's not a gotcha a tradition sets down uh the group that must split let's see a tradition sets down that the group must split the fastest runner goes on ahead and while the rest continues slowly if the runner catches them the trail must loop back on itself this is a singly linked list does a singly linked list contain a loop uh so we should start with a linked list you smile reassuringly yes Tim says but um just a regular linked list please I know you're up on well functional programming but we're a more pragmatic shop here building real software we want something practical this is also why TJ will probably never finish the primary act site he did choose ocamel it's unlikely to be actually ever achieving production at any one point but TJ swears it's gonna happen please please move your copied as a versus capitalism discussion of privately owed to DMS by the user US government thank you thank you for that incredible insightful com uh comment TJ a perspicacious comment one would say um the prespicacity of TJ knows no end I tell you what yes of course you Ascent practical got it one of your spy one of your spiders you can you can't tell which is picking uh up its way careful oh my goodness is picking its way up carefully up to shoot I cannot read that sentence one of your spiders flip take this out I don't want to sell like flip okay don't do some haha editing where you make me look like a jackass just so that you could laugh about it you and everybody else but me and I'm the dummy one of your spiders you can't tell which is picking its way carefully up Tim's hoodie and you scoop it up before typing oh gosh this is lisp no this is cloture is this cloture are we looking at claw jerk is someone just tossing out a bit of cloture I think if you use closure in an interview you are either interviewing at a place that exclusively writes cloture or you're a bad person there's only two potential options here okay you're a bad person that's probably the likelihood because nobody actually writes closure other than Uncle Bob let's see uh well we're not doing IO here it's just an in-memory list agree politely but delete nothing Power Play You Gotta power play this you got to power play the move never apologize for who you are that's right you just get straight into this a simple mutable linked list Dev type mutable linked list value next closure Lang squealable uh sec lazy sec Constructor value secret next okay yeah classic I mean they say closure is really simple you know I think one of my problems about functional programming is that I don't think you can read it left to right something about this tells me that you can't really read this left to right because you're building an internal stack for what's actually happening deaf node mutable list value Adam nil uh link bang me Daddy uh next node reset with another bang this okay I don't even know what this means honestly I don't I have I I genuinely have no idea what's happening with cloture that's not what I was expecting Tim says no no it's good straightforward and simple I was just you know they said on the internet that you were he Trails off looks to you apologetically you know if I could I I mean I hope one day that I can interview and they say they say on the internet you are and I can just like just I can just love it I can bask in it because then I get to determine which Echo chamber which which Echo chamber are they in smile disarmingly and shake your wrist free of your wool shift then clap your hands place them firmly upon the desk and open a portal to the Underwood gen class I don't even know what any of this means this seems great I'm sorry Tim comments over your shoulder I'm not really a closure expert what's this for just boilerplate don't worry about it Tim appears if anything more worried now we do this all the time okay and then a bunch more uh thank you just imagine somebody pulling this out just a man I mean I don't know how many people interview in chat press one in the chat if you actually run interviews okay we got some people that run interviews we got some um have you ever had someone do something like this I've had it once or it's just like hey let's compare a binary tree and all of a sudden you got like I mean we're talking about Constructor functions and it's just like it the person's really going deep on everything but the problem like Enterprise solution possibly even possibly even doing tdd on the Whiteboard and you're just trying to figure out where the hell this this interview went wrong but at the same time you gotta let bro cook right you gotta let bro cook you can't just you can't just stop a bit of cooking you know and even if you toss out you know maybe we don't need tests for this and what do they do what do they do you know what they do agree politely but delete nothing never apologize for who you are this is closure is a dynamic language you explain uh helpfully so when we call back and forth with Java classes there's usually some reflection going on it looks like you uh built a class loader specifically to return a single byte array for a particular class is that is that normal yes you insist I flashing Dangerously I put the s from eyes here and didn't say it right there what is wrong with my brain why can't you just write the algorithm in closure performance you explain holy Earnest since Circle checking is going to be uh uh be a tight inner loop we don't want to write it in such a high level language let's go that's beautiful that that's beautiful uh uh okay Tempstar so you're gonna write the cycle detector in Java then and call it from closure something like that oh baby hitting him with the old hit him hit him with the old baby the cafe babe get him with that Cafe babe right there uh what are these magic numbers you are after all a witch every class begins with a babe in a cafe what you know uh beautiful uh a beautiful man the kind like from the movies relaxing in the afternoon by the Promenade he has a uh a calf a I don't know what that is uh and his orange glass is gleam in the Sun and perhaps some other nice men are jogging by if they are lucky perhaps he will lock eyes with one of the joggers and they will smile and find a brick lined Alleyway together what his lips pressed upon the what the hell am I reading and he feels the heat of the sun infused in there excuse me just half it there if you were uh to be honest you've never understood son's rationale for the story or why the Java virtual machine is specification normally so prosaic lapses into lustful Rhapsody for so many estanzas in section 4.1 we're using version 49 because it doesn't require stack Maps while which keeps things simple now we need the number of constants remember the future never forget that people never forget this dude I don't know what I'm reading at this point what have you guys done to me uh this is a common trick for protocol Wizards many of whom live uh as Merlin did writing constants and buffer sizes before after having written Unwritten the buffers themselves recall that 22 suffice then write that down classic classic I'm sorry Tim blinks but isn't 17 decimal 23 not 22. again you recite sing song Till javasan beg your pardon I don't know how to do this the the javanasi uh surely you have heard of him he is a small magical man something like a gnome who inhabits every jvm if you do not set out an extra constant for him he can cause seg faults but keep the javanus uh happy and your immunities will be fair is this real is this real Java is there actually a gnome that you need to have some sort of constant in a specific place or or it shits the bed this is not chatgpt okay let's ask chat GPT what it has to say uh the passage you presented appears to be a fictional or humorous representation of the jvm development practices it combines technical terms with physical elements to tell okay stack Maps okay don't care the number representation this is hexade decimal representation which is uh which is indeed 23 not 22 is a fictional playful construct there is no Jeffersons in the jvm lore or in specification it seems to be a Whimsical addition perhaps a drawing from European legends about house elves or other creatures I don't even want to read I don't I don't I don't what am I doing here who Am I who am I it is a story from your childhood you remember your mother chanting offsets as she stirred the stew to biter for a Buffon and Evans and okay I can't read that it is it is a happy memory and you lose yourself and until Tim clears his throat oh yes Constance we'll need our superclass object of course ordinarily I'd use existing class to save weight but we're only dealing with interfaces here so object it is and a class for ourself I suppose are you just writing oh we're just writing this in bytes okay you're just writing this in jar code oh is this what a jar is made out of oh is this the constant that some jar needs by the way I've I worked in embedded systems and um is this just jvm by code is that all we're seeing here uh I've worked in some embedded systems for a while and I cannot tell you how many times you'd see a comment next to just some hexadecimal number where the number is just genuinely wrong like it is genuinely incorrect and you're just like what do I do with this number how do I deal with it because it's not what it's supposed to be it's it's it can be very emotionally draining because then you have to go to the actual text spec manual okay so it looks like we're just we're just raw dogging some some bytecode or something and with the iterator we'll need the has next and next the bytes are coming in faster now so this is much better than the old west Norse hexa hexography where both odd and even digits share the same rune cool okay there we go Tim has gone silent now you'd think you muttered that the code would be a common thing to put in the class and therefore might have dedicated by tag but instead we have to put the word code in every class and use it to identify code attributes I'm glad that this is just a retelling of how the jvm might do things finally our signature it is an iterable and returns a Boolean beautiful beautiful 22. the UTF string of 23 bytes to do this boo Boolean boobling Boolean uh every young witch in your clan is required to memorize these bites such Pride you felt when you first encanted a class without training wheels of java C our method yeah forget javasy Flags 21 means code let's go method name starts with lowercase uh letters Tim asserts his voice Rises like a question only by convention almost any string will do and we already have this one in the constant pool well done well done reusing things uh maximum stack okay number of local variables let's go wait wait wait hold on Tim is seized upon a piece of Flotsam in the storm only four variable slots four arguments plus locals oh two till Jefferson you remind him he sputters while you try to remember how many instructions you have written size of bytecode you know your size byte code beforehand okay well done uh your method begins with creating a pair of iterators for us let's see from a single iterable argument okay okay that I'm just gonna say that sounds good to me I I just happen to don't know I don't know bytecode of jvm okay so I don't know that I I'm sorry I don't know these things off the top of my head did you let's see did you mean a store two to mass trying to be helpful variable zero holds our first argument right it did you agree but we won't be needing it again but those aren't even the same type that's illegal if it were meant to be illegal you remind him stagely Sun Microsystems would have made it unrepresentable it's true it's true it's by all accounts true here this is Elden Java ring this is uh one will be a fast iterator her name is jaroon and her legs are strong from years of skiing she flies forward with powerful Strokes thank you thank you for all of all of this and sure fat okay beautiful I I honestly wish this could happen in in an interview if someone could do this for me and make a static Hermes typescript compiled code by hand hire them instantly Bjorn in register zero is fat and lazy he ambles along like his namesake damn calling out a bear like that uh jaroon not to be outdone takes another stride her footing sure beautiful with their positions on the path at hand you check to see if they have run into another and if they uh and if not repeat process again okay beautiful look at that we're gonna do a little offset jump beautiful you're 60 bytes exhausted you sigh contentedly and inscribe the ceiling ruins upon your spell before coercing each number into a single crooked bit bite Tim has been gently trying to steer the interview back on track bless him but not too well or he'll follow you around on Twitter for years to come asking for spells to soothe every computational Milady that befalls him perhaps a ward against minor file system corruption would do milady what no I mean this is awesome I love that we have a linked list and you're doing the whole you're like we're you're writing this all but what is the purpose of this what are we doing I don't know what any of this means I don't write closure what am I doing with cloture it rhymes with chaos you informed him helpfully non-appla uh plus he asked uh see half spot unit test do you weave a story of of a path in the woods which Loops upon itself in preparation beautiful cycle test before casting the spell you invoke four cardinal directions as scars around your wrist h j k and l let's go that's the direction we need only the J wind answers your kind but it never hurts to be polite rent one test containing three assertions zero failures zero errors 350 56 bytes you to claim and stretch and satisfaction J uh J Java C would have produced roughly 580. we have saved a lot by omitting the stack map and line mappings of course but we have also cut the number of variables and cut the Superfluous uh a store and a load Ops as well and of course since this class is never instantiated we don't need to generate an init method or a call Super Tim stares at uh you in mute concern his hoodie gleams with quick melting Frost perhaps you have been hired reach into your pocket of your shift and gently with slow movements as so as not to startle him and send him scurrying back into his burrow extend your hand open your fingers and offer him a walnut is this genius or Insanity I have not the skills to distinguish [Music] [Applause] come on come on people this was beautiful
