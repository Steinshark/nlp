ladies and gentlemen it's currently July 22nd 2023 and as of this morning a world champion has been crowned in the world of chess but on a more important note it's my Grandma's birthday so happy birthday grandma and after I make this recap video I am actually going to uh get on a call with them chat with them show them the dog and it's going to be a great time also happy birthday to any of you in case it's your birthday as well on that note it's time for the final three games June June versus late India this is the Women's World Chess Championship 2023 a best of 12 and yes after 12 rounds we do have a winner we pick things up in round number 10. I've been making Recaps thus far the match is tied four and a half four and a half Jew and June has three games to play so does lighting jab a Jew and June gets two games with the white pieces because that's the way the colors were drawn and she is looking to punch her ticket early she plays the move Knight to F3 in fact those of you that have been watching all of the Recaps know that the last time the Jew and June played with the white pieces she played already with E3 B3 and G3 very sideline type of stuff um taking her opponent out of any known territory and she won a long complicated game so obviously if something works you then proceed to play it again or for the rest of your life like in your case right all of you England Gambit players you uh you're kind of like addicts right yeah no amount of rehab is gonna help unfortunately uh but she plays the English she does not play uh B3 G3 E3 and she is looking to play in English E6 E3 her opponent plays in a very principled way later she plays the uh um which plays the uh the Queen's gamut declined B3 Bishop to B2 and now take take and in this position there are three approaches by white approach number one is to play D4 immediately approach number two is to play Bishop B2 and approach number three is to play Bishop B5 I like to play Bishop B5 because I like to put pressure on the Knight and then play D4 take take and play against the hanging pawns right um which is completely reasonable now if black plays D4 white could get their Bishop trapped if white is stupid uh she's not you might get your Bishop trapped I'm not saying you're stupid but I'm also not saying you're not not not not not not not not stupid there you go anyway A6 A6 is effectively saying well you're never gonna get the bishop to B5 and also I'm gonna play B5 and maybe C4 and maybe D4 maybe D3 and trap your idiot trap your oh that's a blooper trap your Bishop like like an idiot like Gotham said trap your idiot I mean I don't know maybe the bishop is an idiot that's hilarious oh I can't wait to see that in one of those Gotham compilations D4 takes Knight D4 and Latin Jia is playing with what's called an iqp isolated Queen's pawn bishop B4 Bishop blocks why is Zhu and June happy to make this trade because when you play against an isolated Pawn it's good to trade pieces because that pawn is going to very slowly lose Defenders and become unguardable uh Bishop D6 black does not want to trade the Knight goes to D2 because she wants to create a blockade on the Square in front of the pawn and now it's time to have a maneuvering game uh position looks really nice for white nice blockade of the pawn a fundamentally unsound decision here would be to do something like this when you would just be helping black out but this Pond would become a bit of a weakness so uh Knight two of uh Knight two F3 Knight E4 Knight to D2 back now I really wonder what would happen if latex repeated moves right I mean I I don't think that there would have been a repetition you will also notice Knight F3 Knight D2 Zhu and Jun spent 23 minutes on this move had to calculate that real quick 23 minutes she went Knight F3 her opponent played this in about seven then she went you know what I'm not sure I got anything better so she has a great position but it's really hard to make progress why let's say you try to make a move like Bishop to D3 Knight B4 now you're like oh damn I really don't want to I don't want to lose my Bishop Queen F6 okay I'm gonna play A3 and kick the night out yeah but now you can't take right so let's say you play I don't know something like Rook A2 Queen H6 and then and all of a sudden it's actually black that has all of the attacking possibilities so she realizes that and goes back to D2 and her opponent takes the knight in the center and does the exact same thing I just mentioned Rook H6 Rook G6 all of this nasty stuff Queen H4 looking for for checkmates on this side of the board I am hot it is hot today in New York oh my goodness and I can't even turn the air conditioner on because then you're gonna hear the annoying noise in the background um F4 Bishop C5 take take take take take take take take here here take massive Exchange Bishop C5 was offering a trade of Bishops might have been a bit of a rush decision maybe black should have gone Rook H6 and continued with that plan because after this uh White is able to get a centralized Queen and then also win a pawn and then and then Queen B7 my friends this is not the first time in this match if you've been following this match we have had a recurring motto lateing jet hates hates pawns she has been down a pawn in three quarters of the games I don't know what it is about her playing style she is never up upon she is always down upon and right now it's a very bad Pawn to be down she is down a a queen Side Pawn so if the game just proceeds I know the queen is hanging but just like bear with me for a second a position like this is is is very difficult to defend with black like very difficult because white is going to try to expand over here I know the computer says it's equal but the computer is a scumbag you would lose this position with black um and white probably the point is that white just has a majority so if a Rooks is traded if a queen is traded like white is going to very slowly grind black down in the end game and and again the stockfish is going to defend this position successfully by restricting the white position creating checks at top play this is drawable at your level it's really not drawable um Queen D5 though Rook D7 and black continues the pressure right Queen C6 very difficult now for white to try to make progress because the pawns have been split rook d8 and late India still has enough here she just stays active look she's threatening mate Rook A2 Queen C4 a lot of pressure on the position she trades and now she takes and this is going to be a draw because both sides have exactly symmetrical pieces we go to a rook and pawn end game and uh I'm going to hit the forward button just a friendly reminder like you know you you gotta you gotta understand moves like Rook before just lose the game take take D4 F5 King D4 is a draw apparently is King E5 winning yes F6 King E6 you forced the king back and then you go after this Pawn King and pawn end games are very sophisticated had you rushed black would have played F5 and then we would have had a gigantic race look at this Insanity A4 King H3 A5 G4 A6 G3 A7 G2 and we Queen at the same time anyway tldr game 10 is a draw and after 10 games at the Women's World Chess Championship it's five five so it's gonna come down to the last two games if one of them can win they're gonna pull away if latexia wins right now with white Jew and June is gonna have to even out the match but we know it ends in 12. so either this game or the next game has a winner we have an Italian lateing Jam plays an Italian D3 this should be and Knight C3 Knight C3 and A4 very exotic stuff uh not C3 92 Knight F1 H3 like the maneuvering Italian no she plays knights3 A4 super super big sideline and then she plays Bishop G5 so all of her pieces are out she's trying to expand here and also prevent black from expanding and the bishop is always able to drop back black plays Bishop E6 to fight back for the light scores in the center we have take take and now the light squares in the center are being dominated a lot this is very intense Knight to B4 hits the bishop she says no now at this point uh Zhu and June has a big decision to make she can play c6d5 or she just plays D5 right away I I like this less I I like C6 a little bit more but it's a bit slow because the Knight has to go back so D5 take take castles and now white just has a powerful bishop and is gonna spend the rest of the game applying pressure and and and really just trying to break and that's exactly what she does she's gonna play rookie for look at this look at this Titanic battle for E5 this this this this this this this I would argue that White's Bishop is better than Black's Bishop but there's a lot of pressure here and it's not very clear now look at this H4 and if left unchecked white is gonna play H5 G4 G5 like it could get very ugly so H5 she's like no you actually cannot attack me G3 G6 okay now what Unstoppable Force immovable object pressure in the center looking like we can break through but Black's position everything is very very well defended if you play something like C4 that's a disgusting move because after night before you have to sack your Pawn because if you don't sack your Pawn your Bishop just dies okay you can attack The Rook congratulations The Rook will move so this is a very unpleasant position Queen E2 look at the tension A6 A5 Something's Gotta Give something's got to give every piece is staring at a central pawn queen queen D7 the night starts rotating the queen pokes out now June says why am I getting bullied F5 look at this The Rook is pushed back the king slides out of the way of the pin and now black looks to be taking over this game the pawn here is loose Knight C4 the king walks up a little bit Bishop slides back to C2 Queen C7 Queen G2 Knight back to F6 Pawn F3 she's blocking her Queen out but she's stopping E4 the E4 square is being stared at by one two three four five six white pieces one two three four black pieces ten pieces stare at E4 and G3 gets some Vision on it afterwards is the position at any point going to expand will have a massive building tension and all of a sudden on move 34 E4 the position is exploding oh my goodness Chu and Jun has had enough she has six minutes to make five moves white has to be very careful if she takes like this double check and the game is over double check and she is going to lose so she takes with this Pawn fe4 if you play D4 here it's C5 it's E3 it's blocking the queen from the defense so King C1 late castled just to walk her King all the way back F1 E1 D1 C1 look at her King Knight takes E3 in this position Pawn sacrifice Knight to E3 and in this position Zhu and Jun has one of the most disgusting stockfish lines I have ever seen she is unable to play Bishop G5 and pin the Knight to the king because the pawn is covering the G5 Square so instead of that stockfish recommends that you play Bishop G5 anyway what how does that make any sense okay Pawn takes well now you play Queen takes G5 and if you play rookie one rookie eight King to D2 right that that's what it looks like so after rookie one you don't play rookie eight first you play Rook Cafe the queen slides back to G1 so now there's Rook F3 King to D2 Rook G3 and apparently black is winning so what do you do after Rook f8 you don't play Queen G1 you play Queen G2 but then this this is unbelievable stuff Bishop to G5 to bring out the queen and then play Rook to f8 not rookie eight but Rook f8 and the whole point of that is that if you just play Rook f8 Knight F5 check is a counter attack so black has to sacrifice the bishop to open up the f file it's absolutely insane and it's all because the light squared Bishop is Dorman that Bishop is just standing on a shelf it's not actually participating in the game so Jew and June actually has an opportunity to sacrifice the bishop and win with black I'm not saying she would have won if she played Bishop G5 it was still very complicated but with just minutes remaining on her clock she goes here instead and unfortunately that gives just enough time and now if you play Bishop to G5 let's not forget this is too slow so now if you try to go for the exact same line I I can I can run I mean it you you are not fast enough I got here in time so rookie one Knight takes E3 and now all the pieces fly off the board black grabs upon it's Queen Bishop 5 Queen Bishop five and after a maddening scramble the game ends in a draw and it all comes down to Game 12. Winner Takes all next Point wins in basketball on the on uh on the on the court at the playgrounds here it is Juan June is with the white pieces this is her sixth game with white she's already had six games with black she's gonna try to win will she over press that is the major question tensions are high she plays D4 she goes away from Knight F3 E3 B3 she goes to the main opening of her repertoire Pawn to D4 we have D5 Knight F3 Knight F6 and in this position we have E3 it's a big sideline E3 E3 is a weird move a lot of people if they don't want to play C4 they play C3 to try to play a London with a slightly different move order because against the London their opponent wants to go C5 so they play C3 oops so they play C3 so that their opponent can play C5 and then they take usually against E3 people don't really play C5 they can of course and that's what actually happened in this game but generally they'll play E6 night you know this B6 something like this let's see Jam plays C5 okay and now June sends it back to the system that she wanted to play which is this she takes on C5 this is not a Queen's Gambit this is take on C5 and hold on to your pawn pawn to E6 and in this position B4 that's rare this is very rare stuff okay and a friendly reminder that generally these lines where you try to hang on to your Pawn like this they happen like this C5 takes E6 B4 A5 right E3 and now we go back to the exact same system take take undermine if take take with check right and that's exactly what's gonna happen in this game it's the same position it's the exact same position just with a slightly different move order she played E3 she grabs the pawn and she builds up this Pawn Mass on the queen side gives the check on B5 perfectly reasonable move Bishop D7 trades off now if you play C6 there's Bishop before check you definitely don't want that so instead of that white plays A4 and the idea of A4 is that after it takes there is B5 this is an absolutely fascinating position white has two past pawns a b no Pawns in the way if this was an end game it would be game over white would just be winning because the black king would need to stay occupied against these pawns and in the meantime white would just go on to do other things and try to attack in the center and probably try and try to win um but it's not that and what this is is kind of what's called a reverse note boom there's an opening variation where black actually gets these past bonds so Queen C7 Bishop B2 Bishop D6 and both sides Castle winner take all you literally cannot ask for a better game where somebody needs to win it doesn't get any more imbalance than this Knight bd2 now black has multiple options black can play Rook FCA black can play E5 black and play C4 and bring the Knight right like I've I've had this position myself with black it's actually quite terrifying Rook CA Queen C2 and now we advance with the move C4 um there's good and bad with C4 it's also a good idea to go here but that removes your control of the light squares and after E4 if you play D4 I just get a dominant position with Knight C4 and you'll notice the eval is skyrocketing because this bishop is dead blocked in by its own pawns these pawns are now gonna come alive look at the eval it's just growing more and more because black is just going to lose Rook B1 Bishop to C1 and I just pushed my pawns and I win so if you're playing with black you cannot get blockaded okay you cannot get blockaded C4 Bishop C3 white is trying to blockade these pawns and then play A5 B6 the closer that white gets to promoting the pawns are going to become a greater asset because they're going to take a lot of squares away from black or they'll become a liability because white is going to overextend and lose one of them white also doesn't want to be located which is why white is trying to escort the pawns along the dark squares Knight C5 A5 oh my goodness this is really really bad uh black now has to play Knight D3 allow B6 and try to blockade on the light squares okay that's that that's what she has to do it's a very terrifying position look how close the pawns are the queening it's very unpleasant all it takes is a momentary lapse of focus rugby one is there A6 is there uh you just lose I mean also there's just B7 okay there's just B7 obviously but that's what's gonna happen so late team Jeff plays Knight B3 and the idea of Knight to B3 is that it takes takes and this opens up right so Knight to B3 and the other idea is that if something like Rook A2 you can maybe already take on A5 right with something or night takes and then Knight E4 and bring a second Knight in this position needing to win the win the the the Women's World Series championship plays Bishop takes F6 gives up the rook in the corner and comes back to take it even if it costs her one Pawn this is nuts it's a rook and a pawn for two pieces seven eight times out of ten the two pieces are better than the Rook why because just count the material one two three four five one two three four I just have five pieces I have more pieces that can do something all right we both have Bishops but I have Knights right you're you have two Rooks and the rook's power grows the closer you get to an end game and I would argue that we are pretty damn close to an end game so in this position Jew and June Place Queen C3 spends 19 minutes and offers a queen trade black takes and now an end game an imbalanced end game of two Knights versus a rook in a pawn will decide the Women's World Chess Championship in 2023 Rook B8 Knight D4 the pawns are blockaded can The Rook wander in here yeah but it's not actually doing anything so it might have to attack the bishop which is very well protected and then white is going to bring the king all while keeping an eye on these pawns and it's not you know what's amazing for black black has six very healthy pawns and I got news for you it's not easy to push any of them she tries but the second that she tries that's weak so now Knight F5 if you play E4 here you're a lunatic because your pawns have no Mobility I mean obviously you'd also hang a bishop but just in general so the bishop goes back to f8 giving up this for this now Zhu and June will never promote a beep on the game is now going to be decided in this rectangle all of the A and B lines are dead the only pieces that can claim any territory here are Black's Rooks which are very powerful G4 it's an interesting move G6 kicking out the night the Knight blockades The Rook infiltrates but I told you a little while ago The Rook infiltrating doesn't do much but black should have done here is played something like Rook B6 white would love to get all their pieces stacked and pressuring the black position black needs to kick out the bishop so in this position Zhu and June finds the move at may win her the world championship match she plays Knight to B1 undeveloping her Knight completely unafraid of Rook A1 why because of the blockade now black cannot protect themselves against D5 and ultimately the loss of the C Pawn this is why two pieces are oftentimes better than a rook because there's just more pieces The Rook cannot even get close The Rook cannot even defend the pawn there's nothing The Rook can do can't even give a check can't move anywhere can't move here here here or here can't go anywhere useful so Knight to B1 lighting jet plays this and unfortunately she now has to play defense But Here Comes Rook D1 white just has more pieces our value of a rook is Five Points value of a knight is three points but the relative value of a piece depending on the position goes up and down this is a four-point rook these are not three point nights Rook to D6 B6 Knight back to E2 she brings the king she advances forward she plays Rook C1 she plays Knight F4 who's gonna guard the pawn I got news for you nobody she has to give it up but now Juan Jun has a passer G5 but now look at the blockade of these pawns Knight E2 she tries to break away but GF and it doesn't matter King E3 the king is coming Knight F4 let's not forget the king is also an end game piece Rook B8 there goes the pawn Rook F6 Rook C2 sliding up Knight B5 the knights dancing Knights come back to the center King is moving up it's a beautiful display of Peace Harmony every single piece is participating this is a true group effort C3 like the Miami Heat Knight E2 except against the Nuggets Rook B2 King D3 but everybody lost to the Nuggets Rook B1 Knight C3 my friends the pawns have fallen late thing Jeff tries to play this and now we see the idea of Rook to C2 so many moves ago do you know why she played Rook C2 six moves ago to protect the rest of the pawns because six moves later when Leighton get infiltrated the position and tried to get one Pawn back Pawn to F3 defended she just has more pieces takes takes Rook F1 Knight D4 back this game is going to be decided by one pawn and one Pawn only and it is The d-pawn Rook back to B2 King C5 Knight B5 she gallops forward Pawn to D6 Black's time is up Pawn to D7 the pawn is going to Queen Knight D6 Rook B8 sealing off The Rook if you give a check it's just a matter of time I'll play King to D4 the pawn is going to promote and it was in this position 62 moves into the final game of the Women's World Championship Match 2023 resigned and Juan Jun defended her title and is now I believe the fourth time women's world champion it came down to the wire regardless the title would have stayed in China it would have either belonged to late India or Juan Jun and this is actually the first time that since I believe the Soviet Union existed that the two Chess World Champions are from the same place so China's got I mean I hope I hope there's a there's a strong youth movement going on in China to play chess I know it's not the most popular there plus there's also Chinese chess uh which is a thing so um incredible stuff and a great fight to the very bitter end and and what a move what a way to win and what a fight I mean Knight B1 Knight C3 the backwards night move creating the blockade on the dark squares for the pawns very instructive very nice positional game and there we go we won't be having any world championships for a while so this is our our last one until this year we have the world rapid and Blitz in 2023 I hope you've enjoyed the coverage and I'll see you in the next video it won't be a recap you know what to do get out of here
