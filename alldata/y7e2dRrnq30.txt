you can make fun of the strange hat of a pope or of a a bishop and you think that that's funny but somehow you still understand why you need a uniform to play sports you know it's like these are all different levels of the same [Music] reality this is Jonathan Pedro welcome to the symbolic world [Applause] [Music] one of the reasons why it's difficult for several people to understand religion and religious behavior is because they tend to want to isolate religious behavior from other human behavior and so they have this little category here called religion and it's broken off from all the other things that humans do so because of that the religious behavior Can appear arbitrary superstitious ridiculous uh sometimes also people want to reduce religion to a set of things that you believe rather than understanding it as a a coherent uh you know set of behaviors and beliefs that kind of go together I found that the best way to understand religion from a secularist perspective or from a even from a a a purely materialist perspective is to see it as an extension of other types of behaviors and even I would say as an extension or similar in nature to some behaviors that animals have and so uh one of the things that I've noticed is that looking at the way that an animals ritualize behavior is actually a good way for humans to understand why it is that we ritualize behavior and what it is that ritualizing behavior can do and so the first thing to understand is that actually all behavior is is ritualized that is anything which is moving towards a goal has to be ordered and so if you don't like the word behavior let's just use the word ordered so ordered Behavior will happen as you move towards a goal so if you have a purpose the things you do you know will you'll probably experiment a little bit at the outset but at some point you'll realize that you know if I want to get to the river this is the best way to go at first maybe I'll zigzag I'll do this but then a trail will set itself up in the forest to go to the river and then that behavior going from the village to the river for example will become ritualized in the sense that it will become ordered and will have kind of reduced itself to its best uh to its best line you could say to get to the river and so this is something which happens in all types of behaviors whether it is you know the way to hunt or the way to prepare food all of these will become ordered not like 100% ordered but there'll always be a little aspect of variability on the on the out on the margins but the behavior will become ordered and so you could say that when you order Behavior the more you order it you do it in order to avoid the cost of the behavior so you know it's like if I I could get to the river by going all around and going in circles and doing all this and then I get to the river and it's like okay but that's very costly it takes a lot of time it takes a lot of effort and so what I'll do is that I'll start to order my behavior in order to Res reduce the cost that it has you know in terms of energy in terms of time and all of that and in terms of consequences you could say and so you can imagine that this is something that happens even in animal ritual Behavior so think of for example ritualize conflict between animals the animals will ritualize their conflict and will ritualize their capacity to recognize who is the superior and who is the inferior and they will do that to avoid the cost because if they go all out and they fight it out then that becomes very costly both for the one that ends up on top and for the one that ends up submitting to the higher power uh and so because of that we the animals develop this kind of ritualized version of a conflict which looks like a fight but isn't complete does reduces the cost towards something like meaning and we're going to use the word meaning for now we could use other words but purpose maybe we could say is a good way to think about it as you move towards purpose and meaning and as you kind of Encompass you know the reason why the fight is there in the first place then you can ritualize it in order to avoid the cost all right so you can understand how that's as true for going to the river as it's especially true for animals that will ritualize uh fighting Behavior or animals that will ritualize a type of uh mating behavior as well which is that the animal will have certain certain type of dance or certain type of colors that will that will make the choice of a mate less costly than it would if those things weren't there like I said all aspects of behavior are ritualized they're just different levels of ritual so you could understand that if you extend that into the human sphere then you can see how we of course do the same which is that you know we've developed shortcuts uh shortcuts of meaning in order to avoid the cost of something so a good example is when you meet someone we shake hands we look into each other's eyes we have found ways in order to encounter someone in a manner that cuts to the chase right gets to the meaning of it which is that we're we're we're meeting we're not in Conflict we we recognize that there's a kind of peace between us there's a certain level of communion and so we've ritualized that in the type of behavior shaking hands all the other ones that that we have which reduce the cost of figuring out you know how who this person is what it is that they want from me trying to you know trying to move around asking questions I don't know what type of other types of behavior could exist in order to figure out the intentions of the person in front of you but you you can imagine that that these types of behaviors shaking hands and all this you know was was uh was chosen out of a a set of possible behaviors that were maybe a little more costly okay and so as you move towards more and more contracted Behavior what you do is you move towards something like meaning and so what happens in that type of behavior is that what happens in religious uh rituals especially those that we consider religious is that the meaning becomes more and more uh compressed and more and more pure more and more crystallized which is that you know if there's a manner in which let's say we eat together as as a as a people and so we come together we eat together and what that does is it binds us together as a people people we we noticed that if we eat in a certain manner together if we sit together on a table or whatever there are multiple ways to do it but if we aim towards that purpose there's a limited amount of ways that we can do it that it binds us together that it makes us also share in the in the food makes us share in the identity makes us recognize each other as one for example then we realize that wait a minute if I can scale that up and so if I meet together with my family or with a friend and I eat you know that does something but if I have like a banquet at the city or or a marriage banquet where we all kind of come together or some ritual where we're it's a bigger meeting let's say we have a a banquet to celebrate you know the the 30th Anniversary or the you know 100th anniversary of a city then all of a sudden we realize that this type of behavior these ritualization of of Ceremonies of coming together bind us together towards higher purposes and so you can understand then at some point people inevitably started realizing that the more you ritualize it and the let's say the higher you aim the more it binds reality together and so religious ritual is an extension of the lower rituals or lower behaviors all the way up so that you're like oh wait a minute if I offer this up to God if I offer this up to something which transcends my group or transcends you know the the the things down here then I am in some ways uh bringing together all these little meals let's say let's talk about a sacrifice of food all these little meals together and so I'm giving you I'm pouring out a libation or I'm giving up food to to to the ancestors or to the gods and when I'm doing that especially think about the ancestors for example is a good example it's like if I give something to the ancestors then I am doing more than if I eat with my parents because I am binding ing myself to something which is bigger something which holds us all together and so if I kind of play that out at some point you realize that giving up to the gods giving up to to to principalities which are higher above whether it is something like paying taxes to the king that if I pay taxes to the king then it binds us together as a society uhhuh but if I pay taxes to a higher level if I take my my things and I bring and I give it up to a higher level then it it basically binds me up higher and higher and you could imagine you can see how people realize that at some point that kind of moves up and up towards more and more meaning until we reach something like the infinite source of all things right the Infinite Source which is the the you know the god that is being and non-being the the god that is the that is love which binds the universe together you know the manner in which the monotheists start to talk about omnipotence omnipresence all of these infinite qualities which end up binding everything together and so if I act together with others you know towards that then I realize that it's an extension of you know paying taxes to the king and and and also you know binding together as a family but also even within yourself so it's important to kind of see how ritualization in terms of religious practice is has to be seen in uh let's say the the scope of all other types of behavior which are ordered now once again as I say this you have to remember that all behavior is ordered and so it's not like religious behavior is ordered but this other regular Behavior we do is it no that's not true it's like as you move towards religious Behavior it's more and more ordered more and more containing meaning and as you move to the more common space then it is ordered maybe less and the tra tradeoff is the trade-off between meaning and power or meaning universal meaning and particularity that's the way to understand the trade-off and sometimes you actually need to make that tradeoff it's not you know if you ritualize brushing your teeth in the same way that you ritualized the Eucharist or you ritualized a sacrifice to to the gods then then you would lose some of the particularity and so you would it would actually become a it would actually not be the right fit of ordered Behavior and the thing you're doing a good example of this a good example to understand this is to understand the way that martial arts uh develop themselves so you can imagine that martial arts start as fighting right you people are fighting fighting and they realize that if I order my fighting if I if I have a technique then I can beat the other person because I'm kind of I'm I I am Contracting my Behavior towards a certain thing but then there's also a meta thing which starts to happen which is that if I understand certain rules certain ways of doing uh martial arts then I am also going to limit the allout cost of fighting you know just even very similar to the way that animals ritualize Behavior so people notice that in tribal Warfare for example there is Extreme ritualization which means that there's still a fight but often the fight because it's so ritualized it will avoid massive massive casualties because the ritualization you know and and it's kind of not even doesn't even have to be conscious people just kind of learn this behavior and perform it the ritualization will be able to show who's winning the fight without completely decimating everything so you can imagine that even in the world of martial arts that will happen where certain behaviors are there to manifest you know uh it's say a kind of Imagine like a knight's uh the way that the Knights had uh certain ethics about fighting it's like the gentlemanly way of fighting right you don't hit someone in the back you know you look at them in the face all of these types of behaviors are there to avoid the massive cost of fighting and push it towards more meaning but still keeping within the the the arena of beating your opponent now you can imagine that in the world of martial arts especially in Asian cultures people started to notice that you if you ritualize martial arts more and more it can become it can Encompass more and more meaning to the point where it also almost becomes a type of ritual Behavior where it it is almost metaphysical in the way in which the movements are capturing more and more meaning you know if you think of uh of putting DS principles into certain Kung Fu uh Kung Fu moves and Kung Fu uh forms all of this is happening and so it moves towards more toward W more meaning so that actually at some point the martial artist is transforming himself he is he is learning about reality he is moving towards higher and higher meanings as he is practicing his martial arts now one of the things that happened in the 20th century is that somebody realized that that in terms of power it was losing power as it was moving towards ritualization so if you look at what the MMA fighters did is that they said no forget all these forms forget all of these these these flighty things that you're doing when you're prepar when you're doing your your Martial Arts forms it's like get to the cut to the chase use what you need to use in order to beat your opponent and so what happened is that they the the the MMA fighters were able to make a tradeoff between ritualization and power and they move towards power now this is something which is there's nothing it's like it's not that one is better than the other to be honest it's just that it's a trade-off between ritual and power so think of an animal imagine now in the world of the animals where the animals have a ritualized behavior and they understand and they're they're kind of dancing where one person show you know that I don't know the wolf shows its neck and the other one kind of comes and kind of puts their their paw on the other and and to show that there one is submitting and the other is dominating now imagine if there was one wolf who was smart and said man forget all this rituals it's like when the other wolf thinks I'm down and I'm showing my neck and and he's put his paw on me I'm just going to go for the throat and that wolf would win in the moment that Wolf by breaking the ritual the ritual would actually increase his power tremendously and so the and so but what would happen is of course that would also lead to to uh uh let's say in the long term if if a lot of a lot of wolves did that it would lead to the allout conflict between between the wolves and so so this is the same thing that happened with MMA and by the way with MMA you end up having now a new ritualization which is that as you move towards more power you have to have rules in the fight because obviously you don't want to kill your opponent and as you move towards power that possibility of just killing your opponent with one hit or in the right doing the right thing to kill your opponent becomes more and more possible so the the type of ritualization that happened in kung fu or in some of the in some of the more ancient martial arts gets re in capitulated in The Meta rules of the fighting game which is that you're not allowed to do this you're not these things you're not allowed to do because you're just going to kill your opponent so the ritualization reestablishes it itself in another way but what's important to understand is mostly to see just how it is to think of to understand just this relationship between ordered Behavior moving towards more meaning and then finding the balance of order and power you say in a behavior in in order to accomplish what it is you want to accomplish and if you do that then you can understand everything from brushing your teeth to going to church because all of these ordered behaviors kind of Stack Up and scale up towards the the Transcendent towards the infinite good that binds the universe together then all the way down to when I'm learning something new and I don't know how to do it and so I'm experimenting and I'm kind of fiddling you know I'm trying to figure it out so it's messy and it's and and it's uh it's experimental and then when I figure it out I try to order it at the right level so that I can accomplish what it is that I need to do moving towards the purpose of what it is that I'm doing and so hopefully this is helpful to kind of help you understand a little bit how ritualization works and how how it is better and it's more productive for us to understand religion in relationship to all the other behavior that we do rather than isolating it when we isolate it then we we we we just look at these weird types of behaviors and these strange hats and and you know strange costumes and we're like What You Know What's the what's the point but if I can tell you that you can make if you you can make fun of the strange hat of a of a of a pope or of a a bishop and you think that that's funny but somehow you still understand why you need a uniform to play sports you know it's like these are all different levels of the same reality and why you would want the policemen to wear a strange hat because you want the policeman to be recognized in his role as an authority but you don't think that's weird but you think that that the pope wearing a funny hat is is hilarious and superstitious and ridiculous that's how if you were able to connect all these things together then you'll be able to understand more appropriately why it is that religion looks the way it does so hopefully this was helpful uh to understand this to understand things and don't forget folks uh you know if you love what we're doing if you appreciate what we're doing please consider supporting the symbolic world at the symbolic world.com we've been growing quite a bit in the past few years you know I now hired several people full-time to kind of do this and so all your support is there to make this grow as much as possible so thanks everybody and I'll talk to you very soon next year February 29th to March 2nd we're going to have the very first symbolic World Summit in Tarpon Springs Florida a lot of people involved in this sybal R Community will come together to explore how we can recover the ancient Cosmic image to further this community and to further this type of thinking in the world
