i have a big announcement that is a story from kim kardashian's instagram where she shield a scam crypto coin to 228 million followers is anyone else sick of these so-called influencers right scamming working class people their followers and then pretending like it never happened it continually blows my mind that they're allowed to do this and get away with it but i i want to make this video as a very clear warning to people to stay away from this coin it's called ethereum max okay promoted by none other than the hobbit herself my girl ain't no habit and i know i'm a fine one to talk here but uh anyway let's let me tell you all about it let's go to the board okay ladies and gentlemen welcome to the 10 million dollar studio i'm your host coffee zilla and we've got to take a close look at this thing because it is sick what is going on now first of all i know a lot of you guys are excited about getting screwed by kim kardashian but let me tell you this is not the way okay she posted her story saying this guys again real account i cannot believe we're at this point right we used to have the paul brothers ripping people off with crypto now we have kim kardashian basically mrs america herself at this point guys i have a big announcement big announcement guys and then it reads i gotta pause it for a second because you blink and you'll miss it it says are you guys into crypto because you know you know kim big proponent of crypto always talking about it and then the first part is our favorite line on this show this is not financial advice it's always this is not financial advice uh but here let me let me shill this real quick this thing i don't believe in and never heard of prior to five minutes ago my my publicist told me i could make a billion dollars she says but sharing what my friends just told me about the ethereum max token yeah you know guys her friends who also happened to pay her to do this because make no mistake this is an ad i know it's not clear from this wall of text a few minutes ago ethereum max burned 400 trillion tokens that were made up their digital it doesn't mean anything okay literally 50 of their admin wallet giving back to the entire emacs community emacs hashtag disrupt this story ethereum max hashtag wtf max hashtag g-o-p-max at ethereum max hashtag ad and then you have that lovely swipe up uh just in case you weren't clear that this is a paid promotion okay and this is not for squarespace or audible or you know some legitimate product line it's not even like a makeup that you you could say kim kardashian would know something about this is about cryptocurrencies okay and specifically ethereum max is not like a legitimate cryptocurrency like ethereum you might be confused you might think what is that just like ethereum no actually ethereum max is trying to hijack the ethereum name by calling an ethereum x it has nothing to do with ethereum other than it's an erc token like everything else right now or i guess there's some bse tokens right now but you get my point anyway you go to their page and they don't have a single white paper on here instead they're just one of these tokens that redistributes a little bit of the money every time that someone buys their cells by implementing attacks which literally every token is doing right now there's nothing original about this token it says it's considered a lifestyle token it considers itself the culture token emacs provides access to vip experiences it says it has an nft marketplace only it doesn't exist yet it's going to be launching uh sometime i guess this year it's got a few other buzzwords on here but here's the main point you need to know this post sums everything up 39 minutes ago ethereum max had its one month anniversary meaning this thing barely exists the control c control v code base was just created and kim kardashian couldn't wait to get out there and shield these tokens but why you might ask yourself i think that's a really good question like why is it that all of these influencers are promoting garbage scam coins it's an epidemic why is it peak influence or stupidity well yes but there's also a more sinister factor behind all this right it's that well with all these new coins that are popping up that are just copying other people's code bases uh or significantly copying huge parts they don't add anything to the crypto community what they do is rather than spending money on developers they spend nearly all their money on marketing budgets it's all hype right which means they think their real value proposition is like getting enough influencers on board which let me tell you isn't enough to launch a fintech company i'm sorry it's not and so as a result they have some of the largest marketing budgets in the business right now they're paying enormous unfathomable sums of cash to get people to promote little 24-hour stories and as a result their market cap goes like this which they use by the way to sell off some coins and pay the influencer off it's a weird scam scheme where like the influencers really complicit in this thing like it's pretty clear that if influencers didn't spend their time shilling these coins these scam coins wouldn't be able to scam even half as many people and so when i see stuff like uh kim kardashian promoting this garbage i just think to myself you're hurting your own fans and you just don't care but she's not the only one floyd mayweather you know another person who knows almost nothing about cryptocurrencies was also caught rocking an ethereum max uh shirt which again if you just see these influencers doing that that's the first sign you run away like if if gigantic influencers are being paid to shill it run away guys i i promise you it's not worth it but yeah he also showed this token to his followers because of course floyd literally doesn't care about his fans he cares about the money he's said as much he literally says they say it's not all about the money well your kids can't eat legacy he was saying this in response to him scamming his fans with a bogus boxing match with logan paul and ethereum max is the same you could go up to floyd right now and say hey you scammed people with ethereum x he would just tell you like well yeah i mean my kids can't eat legacy right but i for one don't buy this whole like my kids can't eat legacy thing because floyd mayweather's kids are not in danger of not eating the only thing he's doing is just squeezing every last drop of money out of you out of your soul um so that he can be more rich and buy more rolexes and more lambos i mean let's not pretend this is some altruistic thing to feed his family this is i want to be more rich so screw you i guess this is really the attitude of people like this uh who are going into the crypto space and really squeezing every last drop of this scam wave because here's the thing guys these scam coins won't be around forever and these influencers know that and they know they gotta strike while the iron's hot while it's easy to get rich off of your uh failure and you your accounts blowing up they know it's a limited opportunity and they're taking advantage of it so please guys be very careful and the last thing i want to just show you real quick um is this ethereum max chart i mean this coin has only been around for a month and it's already almost hitting new lows i mean it is down something like 80 to 90 of its all-time high value which was right after all this you know shilling took place with floyd mayweather and stuff kim kardashian hilariously has barely showed up even as a blip on this thing over here you can see right here this is when she started to promote it and it looks like people actually have been selling because she bought it which is hilarious but honestly i take that for a good sign i mean seriously when the people who brought you bound to are promoting crypto coins it's time to get out when you burn uh-huh your plastic stars
