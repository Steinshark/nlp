Hello, in this episode we're going to be looking
at arrays and lists, which are both ways of storing a collection of variables of the same
type. Let's start with arrays:
Imagine we want to store a number of different names. Instead of creating a new variable for each
one: string name1 = "Fred"; string name2 = "George"; and so on, we can rather create just one string
array variable, which we do just like creating a normal variable, except that after the type
we place a pair of square brackets. If we want, we can directly assign a collection
of values to the array by having a pair of curly brackets, inside which are all the elements,
separated by commas. Somewhere in our code we can now access any
element in the array by writing "possibleNames", followed by a pair of square brackets, inside
which goes the index of the element we wish to access. Now there are 4 elements in this particular
array, but arrays are indexed starting at zero, meaning that the first element has an
index of zero, the second an index of 1, and so on. If we try access index 4, or greater, hoever,
we will get an IndexOutOfBounds exception. Now lets say we want to pick a random name
from this array for our character. The first step would be to generate a random
number between 0 and 3. So if we're working in Unity, we can simply
use the Random.Range method, and pass in 0 as our min value, and possibleNames.Length
as our max value. The length of our array is 4, but remember
that the random.range method returns a value that is >= to the min value, and < the max
value; which means we are actually getting a value between 0 and 3 like we want. So, now that we have our random index, we
can write string characterName = possiblesNames, with an index of randomNameIndex. Ok, let's look at another example. This time I'll create an array of integers,
which I'll call powersOfTwo. Say we just want to store the first 5 -- well
we've already seen one way of assigning these, so lets look at another. We can set the array equal to a new int array
with a size of 5, at which point all 5 elements in the array will be equal to 0, since that's
the default integer value. Somewhere in our code we can then write powersOfTwo[0]
= 2; powersOfTwo[1] = 4; and so on... Much smarter though, would be to use a loop
to initialize all of these, and we'll be seeing an example of this in the next episode on
loops. Note that we could also leave the initialization
out at the top here; but then we'd still have to define the array's size before we can use
it. Once we've initialized the array's size, we
cannot change it, except by setting the variable equal to a new array with a new size, which
of course will destroy all the elements currently inside the array. Now arrays don't have to have just a single
dimension. Say we want a 2dimensional integer array to
keep track of the pieces in some board game. The syntax for creating this would like so:
... The size of each dimension is separated by a comma -- so here I've create a 3x3 board. A single comma is also placed between the
square brackets at the declaration, indicating that there is space for 2 dimensions. We could now visualize the array as looking
like so, with all elements currently initialized to their default value of zero. The indices work how you'd probably expect,
with the first index determining the row, and the second index determining the column. So in some method, if we wanted to set the
value of the bottom left square to 1, for example, that would be as simple as writing
board[2,0] = 1; Now perhaps the game requires a starting configuration of pieces, with different
pieces obviously represented by different numbers. Well the syntax for this is the same as a
one dimensional array, but now the entries for each new row are surrounded by curly brackets
as well. To make this easier to read, we could separate
each row onto a new line, which gives us a nice visual representation of the array; You're not limited to just two dimensions,
by the way; for more dimensions, simply add more commas! All right, let's now take a look at lists. Say we want to do something like keep track
of the names of every character that our player kills so that we can display them all at the
end of the game. We might think to make a string array called
slainEnemyNames, but unlike the previous examples, the size of the array is uncertain, because
we don't know how many enemies the player will end up killing. To solve this problem, we can make use of
the List class, which is in the System.Collections.Generic namespace. Now to create a list of strings, we write
List, followed by the type string inside angle brackets. We then of course have the variable identifier,
in other words, its name, and we can initialize this to a new empty list. Take note of the syntax for this, we have
the new keyword, followed by List of type string, and then a pair of parentheses to
call the contructor of the List class. Say we now have an OnEnemyKilled method, which
supplies us with the name of the enemy. We can add this name to the end of the list
using the Lists Add method, -- so slainEnemyNames.Add, and pass in the supplied name. Accessing a certain element from a list uses
the same syntax as with arrays: just the variable name, followed by square brackets, with the
index inside. Just like arrays, lists are indexed starting
at zero. Recall that to get the size of an array, we
could use the Length property. You can keep track of the number of elements
inside a list using the Count property. Lists also have some other functionality that
mere arrays do not. For example you can use the Remove method
to remove a given element from the list, you can use the Contains() method to check if
the list already contains a given element, and theres even a Sort method; so if you have
a list of numbers, calling sort will cause them to be arranged in ascending order, and
if you have a list of strings, they can be sorted alphabetically. We'll even look later at how you can instruct
the sort method to follow your own custom rules. So since lists can do everying arrays can
do, as well as change size, and they have helpful methods for things like searching
and sorting, you may be left wondering why we even need arrays. Well I think it's important to know that behind
the scenes, a list is actually storing everything inside an array. Whenever the internal array gets filled up,
the list has to create a new, bigger array and copy all the existing elements over into
that new array. Purely for interest's sake, on the screen
at the moment you can see a heavily simplified version of the List class, just demonstrating
how the array is resized as new items are added. So in general, arrays are slightly faster
that lists, although in most cases this difference is negligible. The real reason you might sometimes want to
use an array over a list is if the collection should logically have a fixed size. For example representing a game board, or
storing the items in a player's inventory. In these cases the concept of "adding" an
item doesn't really make sense; you only ever want to insert an item at a specific index. I should mention that its entirely possible
to have a list of arrays, or an array of lists, or a list of lists, or an array of arrays,
or pretty much any configuration you can imagine. I should also mention that arrays and lists
are reference types. So if I have an empty integer array, say with
a size of 5; and I now create a second array, and set it equal to the first array -- then,
if I set one of the elements to 99 and print out the value of that element in the other
array, we'll see that it also now has a value of 99. If this seems strange to you, please go back
and watch episode 17. Anyway, to recap: arrays are for storing collections
of a fixed size, and can have one or more dimensions. Lists are slightly slower than arrays, but
are able to resize themselves dynamically as you add and remove elements, and also provide
some helpful methods, such as Contains(), and Sort(). Finally, arrays and lists are reference types. That's everything for this video, until next
time; cheers.
