the reason you need the same standards is because if we go outside the wire and I expect you to do something for me you expect me to do the same damn thing and if a guy comes out of that building and he's coming at me and I'm compromised you better pull the trigger or you better jump on him or you better do whatever it takes because we have lowered the standards we are putting people in places that are going to get others killed full stop you and I go outside the wire okay you get shot I'm beside you who's picking you up it's that [Music] [Music] simple hello everybody I'm speaking today with Kelsey Sharon she's CEO of brass and unity and author of brass and Unity One woman's Journey Through the hell of Afghanistan and back she's a distinguished Canadian veteran we walked through her story she was a martial arts Champion as a child she joined the Canadian military when she was very young she served in Afghanistan and had a a series of well what you might describe is extraordinarily rough Adventures there we talk about that we talk about the state of the Canadian military talk about the state of Canada for that matter talk about her um pathway back to something approximating happiness as a consequence of her experimentation with psychedelics for example um we cover a lot of territory so welcome aboard for the ride let's start when you're a kid okay what do you like as a kid tomboy aggressive I started fighting at four years old fighting tech window you start oh yes and and why did you do that my mom saw a demonstration at the cob Mall in Ontario and it was kind of what you see in uh in all these like crazy YouTube where it's like people jumping around kicking boards and breaking boards and doing all this big kind of demonstration to bring people into their Club my mom called me on a pay phone and she my dad was like oh talk to her about it so he told me and she said look if we sign you up you got to stay for the time we signed you up that's just how it works so do you want to try it I said sure let's try it so I did and that was the rest of my existence so it was wonderful were you a little four-year-old yes so I am only 5 foot and about 110 pounds on a good day so I've always been really small but what we did find out later on is that because of how aggressive I was in Taekwondo and how how I was fighting and how often I was fighting I actually stunted my own growth I was doing two a Days by the time I was 12 what what does that mean so I was training in the morning and I was training at night and I was training during the day if I was not at school and I was a second degree black belt by the time I was 12 and a national champion so I took it really seriously and that meant weight classes as soon as you hit a certain age and by you know working in the sauna and skipping and doing those types of things constantly having such a low body fat my puberty didn't come on till later so they think that my height didn't quite go with it either I see yes I see yeah so what did tawan do for you discipline Drive belief in myself the ability for self-reliance you know it's a individual sport for the most of it Taekwondo is something that's really fascinating to me martial arts in general I think are by and large one of the most underutilized um activities for kids for discipline and for ownership and for responsibility I think a lot of people are afraid of the violence Tendencies with it and like I get it it's a striking sport you don't want to kick somebody in the head too many times we understand head injury now much better than we did before but what it gave me was this uh idea that if I showed up each every day and I did the work and I put in the time and I trained and trained and trained I could be the best at something and because of that it was really the self-reliance this piece of it doesn't matter what's going on around me if I'm solid and I go into this fight then I'm going to be just fine and so that's kind of how my life went and turns out I got pretty good at it pretty quick so I became highly addicted to it and it not only gave me a self-reliance piece it also gave me that identity Within Myself very young so when I started to go through the bullying phase where I cut my hair about this short and I wore tear away pants and I wore you know a wife beater tank top because I was always training when the teasing came along and all that traditional stuff that happens to kids it it helped me handle it better I got bullied a ton like lots of girls would pick fights with me and whatever that's fine but I never fought back unless I was hit first I was always taught that you never hit first but if you are hit you make sure they don't get back up and so I do remember the one time I I did get in a fight at school and I was not afraid of my parents at the school I was terrified of my master because he was coming in from Toronto that weekend and he doesn't like when you fight in school and I found out what happens when you fight in school he puts you in the ring and puts you through a wall so yeah ta window was fun so why were you bullied and when did that start that started really early I was always more of a tomboy I didn't really fit and I always did a lot of activities with the boys and I didn't really want to be around the girls it didn't make sense to me because I trained with boys my my uh my coaches were men I was just always in that environment where it had you had to be a little harsh a little harder I also grew up in the middle of nowhere in Campbellford Ontario so I grew up in the woods I come from my mother's side uh came over from Hungary right when the Soviets came in they made it and then my dad's side of the family you know had no running water till he was 12 and he was like this baby of seven kids so I come from this really uh to hard pared parents environment and so going into that sport made sense but that also created the identity of who I was which was a little harsher maybe and in case you haven't noticed I don't have a problem using my voice so I would use it and that's irritating for a lot of people so how old were you when the bullying started um I would probably say like six sixish it was mostly girls yes and what did it consist of at first it was just vocal and they would tease me for my hair because I used to wear you're GNA love this I'm sure there's a my psychiatrist is going to watch this and laugh um so I used to wear uh I my hair used to be really really short because it was easier with a helmet all the time right just constantly sweaty you just always have a helmet on and so I used to wear bandanas when I was going through the growout phas but I also only used to listen to Eminem and so like I like really young was exposed to like this I say like Angry music but like Eminem back then was you know not sober Eminem and so I went through this phase where it's like I was training around a lot of music like this I was around really hard people I went into school and so I just kind of like went into myself because I didn't relate with anyone in school and I was at a Catholic school and I didn't understand and I you know they do their best to kind of teach you what God is and all of these texts and and but they weren't really making it applicable to life it was this is what God says this is what you do this is what you don't do this is why you do it and there was no room for discussion there was no room for explanation or asking the question why so that's something I that I didn't I didn't work well with me I wanted to know why I had more questions and I just wasn't getting answers so I just kind of went into what worked for me and once I did that that's when the pattern of behavior started and then you know then it got to a little bit of violence when I got a little older probably 9 10 because then once I got my black belt people were like oh you think you're MH and I was like no I I really don't in this weight class around somebody around this height for sure but outside of that you know Taekwondo is not really Jiu-Jitsu it's not really applicable in real life I feel like unless you're really good where and was the bullying almost all from girls I had a uh for a little bit there there was boys and I remember a distinct incident where I was on the soccer field and I was wearing te ways and they ripped my pants off I just thought they were not being nice I didn't think anything of it um and at that point I was used to it a little bit I mean I had little clicks of friends but again I was at the club my elementary school was here and my club was right here so I would walk it so I was always there I was there in the mornings I was there after school I'd be there late I used to teach once I had a certain belt level did you have friends at the club oh yeah oh my gosh that was my that was my everything I didn't that's the problem I didn't care about anything outside of it right nothing mattered right yeah right with that masculine attitude of yours that young what do you think would have happened to you in a school now oh I would have been transitioned it's funny that you say that uh I had Natalie Eva Marie on the show she's a WWE Superstar with pink hair and she's very girly now but we're having this exact conversation because she was the same tear away pants you know slides the whole thing she grew up around boys and I said my God thank God we don't live right now cuz we would have been put on puberty blockers I would had my breast cut off I would have been told I was in the wrong body I would have told that that I I wasn't who I thought I was I knew I was a girl I was good at being a girl I grew up cutting and splitting wood that's to me what it meant to just be a girl I could clean the house I could cook and I could cut and split wood so what what why can't I do all of that why do I have to be the opposite sex to do those things and so yeah I would be transitioned and it's really tragic what was it like for you when you hit puberty strange I went from flat as a board both sides no body fat at all to just like disproportionate chest it was a very strange uncomfortable feeling but it somehow at the same time I was going through a whole other level of what I would consider trauma now looking back doing you know a decade and a half of therapy I've realized where a lot of that anger kind of stemmed from in high school and it came because my coach who was my guy since I've been four started sexually assaulting people say sexual assault raping my teammate and she was 14 and my entire world exploded when that all got exposed and I stopped training and I stopped having an outlet and I stopped having a community and I stopped doing the thing that made me who I was and because of that I became radically angry but with no place to put it no understanding why and how to even fix it and my parents didn't know how to fix it they just were grateful it wasn't me what came of that with him he went to prison um he was at a minimum security prison it was statutory rape is what he got I think he did two years years he has since been remarried to another one of the girls we trained with and has twin daughters which makes me real uncomfortable because that behavior isn't by accident and that behavior doesn't go away right right yeah so I could imagine that was extremely hard on you because you you said you lost your community at that point as well yeah we couldn't we tried to take me to a new club to train because my goal was the Olympics from like I I can remember it from like the moment I saw somebody come in with Olympic rings on them at the gym I was like what's that they're like that's the Olympics I went to the Olympics I was like hold up you can go to the Olympics for Taekwondo and they're like yeah and it was over after that that's it that was the only path I could see for my life I didn't see anything else ever not once and so once that was ripped out I couldn't train with anyone I couldn't trust anyone I couldn't trust men couldn't trust anyone around me cuz what if what if it's going to happen again and then that became that also then became a part of my identity this just very angry Ry child and no fault to my parents but my you know my dad's a Long Haul truck driver my mom is now too and my dad was gone a lot and my mom had my brother and I but you know she did the best she could but sometimes like comments would come out like there's something wrong with your head you know those types of things those like borderline gaslighting conversations that happen like there's something wrong with you it's like no I know there's something wrong with me but I don't know what it is and I don't know how to fix it so that point you know I had gone through an interesting childhood the school had called uh had called child services on my mom because one time they were passing out Timbits and I said I couldn't have it because I had to lose weight right yes I saw that in your book so that followed me till I was 18 I had to see a pediatrician to make sure that my mom wasn't abusing me which was ridiculous right but understand I understand it but do you think that that event that betrayal when you were a teenager tilted you towards post-traumatic stress disorder later I thought I've really thought on that I've really meditated on that a lot the reason I would say more likely know is because I think that when you watch someone die the way I've watched people die you're going to have a mark anyway so whether or not it was more severe because of it so maybe yes it tilted but I don't yeah well it was a pretty fundamental betrayal no for sure it is 100% I don't disagree with with you on that at all but you don't see an obvious connection I think I think where the connection lied for me more more than that obvious connection would be so that happened then I went on deployment and a major authority figure after my injury threw all my chit paper in Afghanistan at me and told me it would have been easier if I died so it's like the authority figure here that was a male the authority figure here that was a male compounding on the injury that already happened and told me telling me I was worthless because when you look at this situation and this is where it's this is a little convoluted and and it can seem really weird for some people to hear so just bear with me the person that was assaulted was my training partner her and I were hyperco competitive though don't get that Twisted even for a second this is an individual Sport and I wanted to be like her when she cut her hair I cut my hair right so when it she older than you yes by two years so when it happened to her there was almost this like weird thought of like was I not good enough to even try like you know it's really really messed up to even think that but you get the connection and where I'm saying it's like I was never good enough there I was never good enough here and then I was never good enough in the service so there's that that that kind of identity that runs through it and it's it's unfortunate but I think that was a big part of my life for a long time it's not anymore I know I'm very good I'm very I know my worth now but looking backwards you know that's been the beauty of the psychiatrist I got in 2011 this he's probably about your age very similar to you dress is very similar same attitude in Canada he was one of the first to do post traumatic stress uh research on post Rwanda veterans he served in Rwanda in Bosnia as a medic and this I call him my old man this guy he has put up with everything but he's been the only person outside of my father who has never told me that I'm not good enough even when I went through all of the things with him since 2011 the amount of times I call him tell him I'm going to kill myself I can't do this anymore and the response would always be I have treated you Veterans for 40 years you're not doing this to me I've never lost one I'm not losing one today and that was always the conversation and he was always telling me the truth so I I think a lot of the healing came in a lot of different ways when I after the deployment I think it was a blessing in disguise that's why when Constantine asked if I regret it I said no I don't regret any of it I needed to go through those things to come out the other side and be who I am today and I like who I am today I love who I am today I couldn't say that before I couldn't say that five years ago so you've pushed yourself really ever since you were a little kid ruthlessly yeah and I got the sense when I was reading your book too that I I don't want want to say that you were trying to prove something but because that's a cliche but you obviously pushing yourself up against your physical limits in in your Martial Arts and then you decide to enter the service and so let's talk about that so why did you decide why did and you and you picked a hard route too you went into the Infantry which was probably the most infantry by accident artillery by trade so it's very strange so about 200 I think it was 15 the United States started to integrate women into combat arms roles so I was Canadian and when I deployed my unit went to an American fob so we were working for the 100 verse we were working for Americans we were the only Canadians that were with an American set of human beings we were firing for them and that was in Afghanistan and that was in Afghanistan so so that was different and then I end up doing infantry because the British called and they didn't have a woman to do the job so they pulled me right so I worked with all of them but before that joined the army because I went to college in Ottawa I went to Algonquin for about a month I tried to get out of the town as quick as I could and out of the town you grew up in yeah well I grew up in Cobourg and then we moved to Campbellford and I I went there at grade 11 so up until that point I'd gone to Catholic School my entire life and then I went into a public school for the first time so that's fun transition point and I went to like this Farm Town of this really like you know really small town Vibe hockey team kind how big was Campbellford I don't even know this I don't know the number but it was Tiny we had one at the time we had one bridge and we had a Tim Hortons yeah and we invented the tuny that's our claim to fame there you go it's massive tuning not relevant at all but ridiculous nonetheless and so so yeah we we went there and then I left and I went down to the Remembrance Day ceremonies I always go for Veterans Day in America and my that was one thing my mom always taught me is we always go on Remembrance Day and so we went I went and I took the bus back to alonquin and there was a lady on the bus that was in an Air Force uniform with but like a like a plethora of metals you don't really see that in Canada too much you see it a lot in the states it's they're everywhere they're hanging off of them but in Canada not so much so when you see that it kind of Sparks a little so I went over and had a conversation and just kind of like asked her about what she did and she was a I think she was a pilot or she had flown one of the first females to fly a whole kind of thing in Canada so after that I got off the bus and I just said I think I'm going to join the Army so I went to the recruitment office in right outside the rido mall how old were you I was I just turned 18 I left at 17 yeah and had you graduated from high school I had yeah I had I went early to Al gonin to try out for the soccer team first and then um I went so I started school in September and then I went there right around like November 15th and then I got paperwork that I was accepted in December and I got sworn in in December and I was in basic training on January 3rd so was a quick great yeah right was that a shock I don't think I even had time to be shocked I just made the decision and we were going and that was how it was going to go you signed on the do line so we went right and and so tell me about your basic training what was that like I loved basic training uh basic training sucked but I loved it at the same time there's something about Collective sucking together there's a that that when you call it trauma Bond or whatever you want to put on it but I liked the competition within your group you have men and you have women and everyone's in a different trade and a you know Air Force Army uh Navy and then who's going where and I again loved the the idea of being underestimated it worked for me it's something that just drives me because normally I'm the smallest or I'm the woman or I'm the whatever kind of like title you want to put it on none of it matters to me at all and so we had a couple women so immediately there was a clash with that cuz what happened was we would go down and do the 10k run in the morning and then would because we weren't allowed the elevators and then I would Sprint up the stairs but I was first so I got to the shower first it's like okay you want to be first be faster so they didn't like that I was just standing out I started to stand out a little bit and um I mean it was good for the most part it was a little rough I had a little bit of the same sort of stuff from elementary school kind of happen there and it's like okay if it's happening everywhere you're the problem but I didn't know at the time that it was a thing that I was doing turns out I'm just way too masculine and I'm way too aggressive for a lot of women and that rubs some women the wrong way and so now knowing that I understand that then I didn't and so we we went through basic training and it went well graduated on time nothing went crazy how many women in basic training compared to like what was the mix we had like five women in our group and the rest were men how many men oh yeah okay yeah so we had what did the men think of the women depended on the woman okay explain that some were sleeping with the women were competitive with the women some other women were a lot smarter than all of these guys put together they were like doctors that came in and were like I'm going to join the Navy you know so there was some we had some switched on women but then there was there was a different level of physicality and because we all have the same PT tests because this is when we didn't lower standards we were all one standard which we should always be MH uh some women some women didn't pass the push-up test the first time it was I think the push-up test was five or 10 push-ups MH um some you couldn't pass the Beep Test you couldn't beep is beep so you know in a gymnasium they put uh uh like one of the lines over here one of the lines over here and it would beep and you would go beep and you have to run the other side before the next beep and go beep and then you have to run and it would get faster and faster and it was a long drawn out activity and you had to hit a certain amount of beeps to be able to qualify for the physical and a lot of people didn't couldn't hit it people were just overweight and so if you failed a certain amount of times you went up to the 13th floor which I believe is the 13th it's called fat camp and you go up there until you can do it and then you get put back into a new group so that was always a fear for some people um I didn't struggle with that because I came right from Sports into that so I was in great shape right so you didn't have any trouble with the physical element no no no because basic training isn't isn't the heavy stuff it's the cardiovascular work it's the ability to be yelled at and not break it's the ability to uh learn task on sleep deprivation can you function with little sleep and so for me that was not too bad cuz my dad would wake us up at some ungodly hour to go cut wood I was pretty used to it so it worked out and then after basic we uh graduated and then we all got posted to our trade specific training I was a artillery Gunner so I went to Gagetown um engag town is where you do your SQ and your dp1 grenades machine guns all the major weapon systems that you get the opportunity to shoot you learn them there once you're done that then you go to your hyper like trade trade so artillery so then I went to the 105 guns and the mortars did you have any familiarity with weapons before oh God no i' had never been exposed to guns my dad had a a 22 for raccoons you know I never hunted I never shot anything nothing at all so it wasn't like a draw to the raw raw of the the Weaponry or the the violence of it it was more of a this looks cool I think I could do this but I think everyone knew I was either going to be a cop or I was going to go do something else I just didn't know at the time MH and so so we went through training there and that was fantastic and how did how did the women do when the standards were equivalent like I said some women failed yeah yeah for sure 100% just I presume some men failed as well oh there was definitely a few we had a couple individuals you'll find this comical who joined because they said they were good at uh what's that like not Halo but it's a video game it's like a war video game and I couldn't help but kind of do one of these and yeah they out they just overweight mhm because again if depending on the floor you live on that's how you get up and down well if you think about how many sets of stairs you had to do in a day we're on the ninth floor we have to go down for breakfast because you have to swipe that card if you don't you get in trouble then you have to go back up so there's two then you have to go back down for PT there's three you got to go back up there's four now you're going a 10k run you're doing log stuff and you're doing all this stuff now you got to go back up and you and then they would just run you just because they felt like it and then you would do the same thing at night and then if they decide to toss bunks you do the same thing again so that if you're not in shape like that's hard for anyone to do all the time and so when we got to Gagetown they kicked it up a notch right because now you're you're dealing with real guns real weapons and how do you handle them how do you carry them and I remember the first time I shot a Carl Gustaf which is this just the massive big guy here that goes on um goes on your shoulder and it feels like you're just getting like sucker punched by Mike Tyson in the face when it goes off so be it's a run by two people so one person holds it one person loads it and so we went to shoot my girlfriend and I who was one of the tiny ones as well and my sergeant looked at me and went no and he just went over and wrapped both of us together and did one of these and uh I remember shooting that for the first time and it was like oh okay okay I get it now this is not pretend these things are for real mhm and then we switched to artillery and once we went to artillery that was a whole new animal we were on 105 so they only have a 40 lb round explain the difference the weapons y so Carl gustoff is a you know shoulder propell rocket launcher um I don't has an explosive head it does have an explosive head I didn't shoot any of those overseas so I'm not like hyper familiar with them we just did those in training um then we have uh for me the things that I shot the most of was my C7 which was a long barrel uh shoots a 5.56 or 762 round and then we had hand grenades um they don't look like the pineapples they're round like a baseball the modern ones and then we had mortar rounds um that shoot pretty somewhat accurately 5 kmers within m so we had those and then we had the 105s which how does a mortar work so to the best of my recol recollection um so it run by it's run by two people it's a it's got a a round plate in the ground that sits there that can hold it down and it's a long tube and at the bottom is a firing pen and then you've got a site on it it just kind of looks like a metal off piece here and then what you do is somebody lines up the site with the the grids they're given and then um the other individual comes with the round and they hold it on top of the tube and then then they say fire and you just drop it and you duck your head to the side of it and then it shoots it goes down hits the firing pin and then propels out and so we did a lot of those because that's our job artillery is also moriman and then we when we went to the 105s those are what I kind of described to people like if you've seen any war movie with like the horses or You' seen them with a boom that's what that is and the 105 is a 40 PB round goes about 20 km I'm probably give or take on that and it's got the big brass casing that you kind of see those big round guys that's what that one kicks out at the back end um that's what you train on but I then deployed on the trip 7s which is a55 millimet Howitzer same sort of deal modern site um GPS you can use GPS guided rounds on it it shoots around around 100 pounds it can go up to Max 40 km I believe and so that thing is a different level of hurt I mean it's 100 lbs of H or Loom or white phosphorus or whatever you're going to shoot and it's you know I they the saying is it's it's like the hand of God it'll Reach Out And Touch you wherever you are M and so that's what I deployed on and when I got posted from Gagetown I went to a French unit and that only happened because another individual was struggling with some kidney problems from heat exposure he was taking too much creatine and had really been one of those guys in the gym that was not looking after himself appropriately with all of the supplements and so his kidneys crashed out in the Heat and so at that point they said okay he can't go to Velar and you're going to pahua and his dad's at Paha and I was like well I'll trade so it gets French and I'm like yeah we'll learn it's our second language isn't it and so I went to Quebec and then I got there and uh no one spoke English and I had a female officer and that was about it and so I deployed with those guys I got there in September of 2008 did you learn to speak French uh just by being around I don't speak it anymore cuz BC doesn't speak French right yeah it's every other language so I don't practice um but I learned kind of as I went my first interaction with my sergeant was I don't want you and I went nice to meet you and so it was a good start yeah using the internet without expressvpn is like not paying attention to a safety demonstration on a flight most of the time

toaster kind of stuff so I would be I would ask him like use him as a human translator I would be like glass and then he would just translate words and eventually I would start to pick up little sentences here and there and then it was franglish then it got to a point where I could understand and I was the remote weapon system Gunner for the Tav which was a turret tank like a tank that we have that has a turret that shoots um shoots a I believe it's a C6 puts a machine gun and it's a computer system so I learned that in French and then I went and learned all the trip 7s in French and the commands in French and the radio commands in French and the motor systems in French how did your how did your fellow soldiers react to you on the French side you've been to Quebec R yes I lived in Montreal for a good that's right so you know when you hit like Quebec City and you go north they don't really like English people as much yeah so it was about that and then when you look at the gun troop and then you get one of your gun troop members as five foot and 100 pounds at the time you go oh great now I'm going to have to do twice as much work right and so it just again it's that prove yourself here we go again and so I was fine with it and we did it and it was all good and once they got a little confident once they could see I could load around once I load around it's like okay she'll lift things at least and um it was strange there had to have some conversations my sergeant now we're friends um now and we've spoken since he goes yeah we we had to have constant conversations about them leaving you alone just like sexually cuz that stuff was just rampant it's still rampant it's just not ever prosecuted yeah yeah so okay let's I want to for sure wander into the Afghanistan territory and your experience there but I'm also curious about your feelings about um women and men in the military yeah so you were you were in early obviously and you were in before there were differential standards yeah and you made reference earlier to the fact that you think that the same standard is appropriate 100% okay so tell me why you think that perfect example you and I go outside the wire okay you get shot I'm beside you who's picking you up right it's that simple okay so what do you think that implies for women in the military like I mean the the idea is that women can do anything men can do that's not true yeah I know I know it's not true and it it it doesn't even seem to me that it's particularly appropriate but it isn't like I exactly know how to deal with that I mean you obviously worked yourself you know half to death in order to be able to manage this and you did manage it and so it's hard to say well it's hard not to say well good for you right but by the same token it seems to me odd that we're insisting as a society that especially in I would say especially in direct combat that men and women can play the same role and so what do you think about all that I think it's really complicated and I'll tell you why if we were fighting on average an enemy that played by the same rules or had similar respect for women yeah well that's also a big problem but that's the problem that's the main problem right well okay so we could talk about that a little bit too well it seems to me that women are at risk if they're serving in the military in a way that men aren't not sure okay I can count on all my fingers and toes right now the amount of men who have been assaulted by other men in their units by like special operators too I'm not just talking about like say like grunt people you know what if you're captured you take that risk yeah but God that's oh yeah it's hell we've seen it we've known women who have we there's videos of Israeli women who were captured who were tortured to death and raped to death and and we have that on every platform so I get it but at some point it's you have to make the decision I was willing to risk it because I genuinely the people that I was with did you know what you were risking when you were willing to no I don't that was the thing I you know what that's funny that you said it Constantine said the same thing he's like do you really know like what you got into no and anybody you can say that about life in general but this is a very extreme situation and I can't imagine what would have happened to you if you have fallen into the hands of the wrong people in Afghanistan let's say you know I I've never thought about that but I don't know I don't think they would have been able to keep me very long I would have been a problem problems get eliminated fast like honestly I I'm that person and in in that time in my life if you said I need you to go run and jump over that wall and you're probably for sure are going to die mhm if I knew someone was on the other side of that wall that needed to get pulled over that wall I'm risking it MH I'm risking it every time I hate that about myself sometimes because it's like the sacrificial like I will I'll risk it if it means getting somebody who needs something or somebody needs help I'll risk a lot I'll it's probably not a great trait on some levels um but I will and I have and I do it again what about the standards now the standards were in place okay and and what's changed okay so standards were in place you know push-ups sit-ups y yada the reason you need the same standards is because if we go outside the wire and I expect you to do something for me you expect me to do the same damn thing and if a guy comes out of that building and he's coming at me and I'm compromised you better pull the trigger or you better jump on him or you better do whatever it takes now women become a distraction I don't they become a distraction because two reasons men act different when women are around we know that we know that they just respond different if a woman's getting hurt doesn't matter if he likes me or not he's going to respond differently he could put himself in danger now he's going to react differently and secondly because we have lowered the standards we are putting people in places that are going to get others killed full stop mhm we are actually making it more dangerous for people in service on planes in other areas by lowering the standards in society together and we're doing it and we're seeing the repercussions and we're not stopping it so where's the line I've been asked do you think women need to serve if you want to respect the rights of the people we are fighting unfortunately I need to be there women have to be there there because the Taliban and Isis and God knows how many other enemies we've continued to make there are women on the battlefield and they will use them if they are covered head to toe and they will put men in those burkas with AK-47s and suicide vests and they will think a woman is walking up to them who's not a threat and they will detonate and they've done that and they did it time and time again the Taliban got smart and realized that we as uh westerners to a fault will follow the rule but they don't have to and when that started to happen people started getting killed more because they would hide themselves in women's positions so they're like okay they're not going to bring women on the front lines with them so the women and children would flee and that's how it would be and then we started going well we have to do something about this because they were hiding weapons money jewelry indicators that they were working with the Taliban in like women's hair and like under their burkas and under their breasts and like things like that so when I finally started going out there you're finding all kinds of things cuz all of a sudden there was a woman there to actually search people and we had never done that before cuz a man cannot touch a woman and so as long as we want to fight fair as long as we want to fight up against the you know current individuals we're fighting whether that's Hamas or Isis or the Taliban you name it speaking of the Taliban side tangent here 2 seconds have you seen the new article that came out and they were like oh my god did you know the Taliban have started stoning women again that that doesn't really shock me when did it stop Jordan I'm sorry and also all of these people who have something to say about it where were you for 20 years when we could have done something about it when we were standing there watching it and you said we can't do anything about it so why do you care now you don't care selective outrage I'm over it sorry D who are you speaking about particularly with this elective outrage oh you name it anybody on social media with a face anybody who's uh an influencer or a political commentator or these people who have made their careers off of just adding more negativity to the world it's constant nihilism for young people to click on and become obsessed with the next new rage event it's really hard to watch now you had a particular role in Afghanistan you said for example that you were searching women did I was searching women right so and that that's a specific role for women Andre you believe that that's a useful role what now what what do you think what do you think has been the consequence in general of introducing women into the Armed Forces I mean there's a there's obviously continual sexual scandals in the armed forces in Canada it's always been there we just haven't reported it okay meaning meaning it's always been there in what way because there has been women in the Army right just not in combat arms roles in other countries for us there has so those assaults have been going on for the the individual for example I won't say his name he's got a world of hurt anyway uh who told me that I it would have been easier if I died he's been charged with seven sexual assaults but he made it to Major and he's not being arrested or put in jail and he's getting to leave with a pension so what does that say to everyone else below him do it just make sure they're quiet about it and that's why it keeps happening we don't actually take accountability for our actions we never have because if we did it would stop okay so I I read a an article in the Canadian military Journal I don't remember the name of the journal but it was their Dei um uh issue right and their what would you say recommendation for decreasing the frequency of the sorts of things that you're talking about was a retooling of the entire culture of the Canadian military well I don't exactly understand what that means because the culture is going to be a War culture right and I presume that there are downsides to that as well as upsides I don't I don't know how to understand the downsides in terms of the relationship between men and women but if you have a lot of young men together who are single and a lot of young women together who are single then there's obviously going to be uh sexual interactions on a Non-Stop basis and I have no idea how that can be like reasonably regulated I suspect that the Dei approach is not going to work very effectively no yeah so Dei that's a trip Canada's lost its mind uh okay so I spoke to Buck Angel recently and I was asking him his opinion on how the Canadian military has just put tampons in the bathrooms yeah yeah and then and then made it uh what a particularly punishable offense for the young men to take the tampon dispensers out of the bathrooms which is obviously exactly what they should do they should never have been in there in the first place well yes that's for sure yeah so bad leadership right you might say that already we can go with bad leadership that rolls downhill we have a saying in the military uh rolls downhill and so that's obvious so Dei is rolling downhill and it's rolling down to a already crippling military our military complex in Canada is shrinking astronomically and not only that it's shrinking because veterans aren't being looked after uh people at gag 10 are having to rely on food banks to eat because they're not being paid enough uh no weapon systems are coming in people are having to pay for their own flights come back from from where did they go was it Lithuania they were over there excuse me they were playing War Games I.E they were just trying to be a show of force or Putin anyway so and then we bring in Dei so here's what's happened since I got out this was a trip I got to go back in 2020 one 22 to New Brunswick to go shoot my last round as a gunner I didn't know this was a thing but when you're like super old or something really bad happens they bring you back to shoot your last round you are you super old or something bad happen you're going to be 35 this Jordan so we're going to go with something bad happened and they really messed up and they know it and there was a book written about it they didn't like it so so what happened was I went and I shot my last round and it was this you know all the big wigs came out and all of this and it was amazing because there was actually a female there that was a colonel that I actually respected and so it was a really big honor to get to shoot with her and so I'm there but what I saw was really troubling to me dis shuffled beards long nails piercings jewelry weird colored hair and beards we had lost the standard we stopped doing the standards of what it meant to be in the service men have to be clean shaven women have to have short nails you have to have one earring you can only wear where wedding band like you don't do these things their hair was a mess they just looked a mess and I said what am I looking at here so this is the new standard so if you start to lower the standards people who have served like my friend Dallas Alexander who got slapped by the government for going on Shawn Ryan people like that leave right the experienced people who you need to teach these standards the best people leave oh 100% And so this is what's happening so now you've got Dei so what happens with Dei well Basics that we know men now are in women's spaces vulnerable spaces men now are allowed around women in environments that they just shouldn't be in service in general meaning we we normally get our own shower time right and where we get our if we have enough women we get our own tent if you didn't you just you you're with the guys and you're used to it it's fine and so what was happening is people say that it's an assault issue it's a control issue it's a leadership who has been told time and time and time again you can get away with it it doesn't matter you're going to get away with it if you're high enough rank you got the right people around you you're going to get away with that so what does that say to women it says well I don't really want to be in the service so now you're losing women or you're having women transition to men so they're accepted in men's spaces and they're accepted as a male so maybe they won't get raped because you've got you had a Navy ship just have to come back recently uh in the United States because there was like 30 assaults in 30 days and women were just pimping themselves out early so they didn't get raped they said well I'll just do it now because then that way I won't get assaulted so it won't be like traumatic it'll be my choice and so people are saying well why are we why are we allowing women how about you just stop raping people guys where is the accountability on the man where is the accountability on the staff where is the accountability on the leadership to go hey if I catch you doing an assault this is what's happening to you you're out you're gone you're your job is over and you're GNA have a dishonorable discharge for sexually assaulting someone then you're going to get a criminal charge why aren't we doing that well why do you think because we already have no one and also there's a lot of people that are old school that are still in that are going to cover because oh what if a guy's like one year away from his pension Kelsey let's just let this one slide you don't want his family to not have any money right you don't want his family to lose his pension you don't want them to have that name in the school do you like it is a it's a hypocrisy there is the service is filled with some of the best people that we have to offer and then it's filled also with some of the worst we have to offer because it attracts A type personality there's bad eggs and everything you know with the police yeah there's some bad eggs but they're not all bad and that's kind of what's happening with the service Bad Eggs not all bad removing funds what happens shittier people so it's happening in the police now it's happening in the service and we already have one of the smallest armies so we're being bought and paid for by the CCP left right and Center approvable by cus on paper and then now we have weak borders no military no weapons running out of artillery rounds and giving how many billions of dollars somewhere else why would you want to join the service why what you can be patriotic and I applaud that I have people come to me all the time my daughter's going to join can you talk to her so I'm not going to talk anybody out of anything there their path if they believe they need to go do it they will go do it but at the same time I'm sorry this is not the country I fought for so why do you think this is happening to the military in Canada it so it's really easy to control people when they don't have somebody to stand up for them look at the look at the protest okay so when our own police turned on people at the protest you mean the trucker protest yes so I was involved with that in NBC and um my parents are truck drivers who do you think I'm going to support and also my business was crashing because of them and I was losing everything that I had just built post Army because of them you actually think that I'm going to stand for this and watching what I was witnessing anybody in their right mind was not okay with this so I came out and I did a sign and I said I stand with the protest and everything just went and I started talking to some friends and then next thing you know we got like a leaked WhatsApp chat from the RCMP and it was like saying some really nasty stuff about how they were going to like take their Jack Boots to the protesters face they were using Nazi comments they were doing some really nasty things and what I realized right there is who is going to stop us us when the police turn on us it's like at least we have the service at least we have the veterans like our it's not the military that's going to stop it because they're weak-minded at this point if you're a Dei you know believer in that service I'm sorry you're not if you believe in Dei for the Army or the Navy or the maybe the Navy but or the Air Force I'm sorry you've lost the plot you forgot why you joined you forgot what real war looks like you're delusional and you're going to cause harm people are not going to like that comment I'm going to get all the hate I don't care because that's the truth you're not a free thinker your job I get you've been told that you were supposed to follow in suit but there's also a point in your life when you come to a fork and a road and you go do I believe this if you go no it's going to suck but you have to stick to what your truth is and mine is that behavior is not acceptable so who is going to stop us well it looks like the veterans CU it's not the military because the veterans are the ones that know what war is cuz we've all been there for the past 20 plus years and now we're all rocking into it again the military doesn't look after its people doesn't equip them properly doesn't feed them properly doesn't look after the families and puts you on a increasingly dangerous amount of pharmaceutical intervention instead of actually solving the problem so why would you serve I'm sorry never again not for Canada so what happened in Afghanistan you went to Afghanistan you were with the French unit I was with the French we went to fob this was when uh so I went uh so I got to Valar in September we deployed in April of 2009 2009 2009 how old were you I was just turned 19 and so we went my uh battery R uh troop Alpha we went to fob ramrod so they go two guns at a time so two gun troops so we had two triple sevs and then two people two uh sorry troops filled with enough people to run both those guns the comms and the officers so we got dropped off there in the middle of the Mayan District it's just like a 3 kmet fob really small in the middle of nowhere and that was the first time I had been outside the wire and went oh there's people out here that want to kill me it was very shocking and um immediately we we transitioned with the other Canadians and we we started right away and so we got to know some of the Americans uh the French didn't want the Americans on our side and the French wouldn't speak English to the Americans but I did so I wasn't chummy with everyone here because I couldn't really talk enough to have like full conversations so I started talking to the Americans and there's a lot of guys from Texas and from all over the place and it's wild because everyone thinks the military is racist but it's like the most welcoming group of people I've ever met there's people from everywhere all walks it was crazy and so that was great loved the fob um when we were shooting it's boring otherwise you're just working out or you're you know you said love the the fob tell me f uh Ford observation base and so that's just where our little home was we had our tent that's where we slept that's where we shot guns how did you understand your mission like what what was it that you I wasn't given a mission set I wasn't given a mission set that was a gunner it was you go here you shoot the guns when you hear the fire mission run to the gun follow orders right yeah right right and the only other time is we would go up onto the op Tower and that we had a bunch of op towers and Canada's Tower was this one so oper um um it was oh my gosh it was the something post uh oper observation post holy brain get it together we're going to get there and uh you would do four hour shifts uh with the machine guns and you would just watch that's what you did and then you do radio calls so I like to mess around with the Americans and do them in French it was just fun for me and um and then any time there's a fire mission you ran to the gun so that was like my life for a long time how long um I think for that was like the first couple months and then after that uh I got a well A call came down to the Tower and said Kelsey you need to come into the tent and I went into the tent and Sergeant Leblon was there and he said hey so there's about to be a big operation and the British need you to go with them I've told them no and I was like hey man I want to be infantry don't don't take my dream let me go do this dad like I want to go do this like let me go live my life you know and he goes I don't want you going I said why why and he goes because you don't understand he had deployed uh to Bosnia and he had deployed before and he had used his weapon in combat and that wasn't artillery right so it was small arms and he's like I don't want you going and I said okay and um he said but they're not going to say no they're not letting you stay so what he did is he said come with me and we went and got my my rifle kind of sorted out he stripped his rifle down because he had deployed before he had all the Gucci kit and I just had this like old sight that doesn't work unless it's at like 400 km it's not going to work for close combat at all like it's terrible and he got me you know the the the tack light and all the cool things and gave me all of his this is where it scared me a bit he emptied his vest and took all his extra mags and went you're going to need these and he laid it out in front of me and it was a lot of magazines and I was like you really going to need that he goes okay and then he took me to the the little range we had there in Aero my weapon and then he said they're going to come get you tomorrow so they were taking Small Arms fire on the way and they couldn't come get me so they said if they don't come tomorrow you're not going so he was all happy they came they picked me up there was a bunch of tpps on there and a bunch of other individuals interpreters sorry yep and um within that there was just a bunch of random people on the shinook you know bits and pieces from all over different places of Afghanistan people going to the hospital some interpreters some of the military and they Dro me back off a calf which is the um it is essentially the massive base within Kandahar where everyone flies in and out of if you hear about the Tim Hortons or the Pizza Hut it's there and so that's where the British were and they dropped me off and then they dropped me at the British gate and they said here you go and I walked into the British and I introduced myself I don't know how to read the ranks so I don't know who I'm talking to they just have all different little you know we had Chevrons at the time they had different stuff and so I must have been talking to someone high up and I think it was a command calhon Commander no idea didn't just terrible and I said hi I'm I'm going to work with you and they said okay you're going to be our female at so just female Searcher you're going to come with us um you're going to go see the RCMP here real quick they're going to tell you what you can and cannot do they're going to give you some zip ties and some gloves and we'll come get you so I went to the RCMP they gave me a quick overview of what I could and could not do and um what could you and could you not do I couldn't so I could not put uh duct tape on them but could zip tie their hands um I couldn't put them in certain positions I couldn't put a bag over but I could tie their eyes um if I was removing things from the women they had to be set down in front of them so they could see that we weren't stealing it that we were just removing it from them and then uh you know just pressure points I wasn't allowed to push said okay and then I got gloves and a bunch of zip ties and then I went back to the British and they said okay we're going out tonight at uh 1:00 in the morning and this is what we're going to do you're going to go from house to house to house to house and anytime there's women we're going to call you and you're going to follow that guy right there with the bombb dog he's got a black lab named Benji and you're going to follow him everywhere he goes don't lose him he's with you the whole time I said okay and then uh they said you can go sleep and I said I don't think I can and then we set off in a little school bus over to the Airfield and then hopped on a shinook and I sat on the floor which was a bad idea and then people stacked around me and then we took off and we went out um it was the first time I used like uh nvgs so nods to see at night and all of that so that was interesting and that was about it to be honest that's all I got told and then we went out on foot and we had a hot LZ and we landed yep so we I'm going to get I'm so sorry no problem um we were taking some small arms fire when we came in and they dropped us off really quick problem was people were sitting on my legs so I couldn't feel them so when they I stood up my legs I went to run they gave out and so a Brit a Scottish guy just grabbed the back of my vest like this and did one of these and just kicked me in the butt and it was like I off you go and I was like here we go and so we went out and then we waited until morning prayer because of the respect we have we wait till they're done their morning prayers and we kick their door in and then I was told they're not going to use me a you know Burns we haven't had people women and kids around a lot they've been leaving I said okay they told me we're going to be out there a week I was like okay first house we need her and I go it was my first experience of what 12 women and kids screaming and crying in a room by myself looks like and that was a being a mom now I really wrestle with some of that stuff I didn't then I had no reference point but being a mom now I I really wrestle with wrestle with what kicking people's door in in the middle of the night M with your

Taliban or anywhere near sort of IED which are improvised explosive devices uh any of those farms and that's all I was told and so if I were to find big wads of money or I would have find cell phones and and any of those things I was like bring them to them like okay this is what I found who I found it onh and so did you H yeah yeah we found a lot um they hid stuff in women because they didn't think I'd be there to search them and so so does that help you reconcile yourself to what you did no why not cuz I still did the thing I still inflicted the trauma it was still a part of the pain doesn't erase it it's there though so it's an uncomfortable feeling something I've definitely worked on a lot but it's definitely there like K my door in the middle of the night yeah yeah you know mean it's very immediate hey what you're involved in is very immediate and it's like bang it's just like it's just like screaming and like Madness and chaos and you know it's right after they're praying it's just dirty feels dirty like I get why like don't get me wrong I'm not saying like we shouldn't have done it that way but like shock and awe is how you don't get killed right it's like my buddy used to say to me I'd be like how did you guys like how did we lose so many more people than the SF he's like we move at night quiet we get the job done and we leave conventional forces we roll out at the same time every day we go down the same road every day you know we're we're sitting ducks it's different so anyway so it's you got to be quick and you got to be shocking all a bit right so that's the tactic and so we started doing that for a while and that was going okay I had a couple scuffles with men in the family thinking I was a boy going into a room so we dealt with that a little bit which is always fun the interpreters didn't like that I was there there's not a lot of respect for women especially a female Soldier so that was an interesting relationship to kind of work around if you will and and then we had a couple situations so situations wow I would have so that's an additional difficulty of being female in the armed forces in in in those countries yeah absolutely because if you're fighting a country has little to no respect for women by and large across the board depending on your level of extremism yeah you know you you're going to be dealing with uh a different trust issue right yes well I would imagine that you're particularly hated too oh yeah you could feel it like Burns through yeah you can feel that but that's okay I equally hated them just as much and I made sure they knew it so again this is where that masculine side switched on and there was no feminine left and So within a couple days of being out on on on on our on foot operation I was with except you said that it bothers you now that you're a mother it does bother me I mean I think it should bother anyone you're a I'm not disputing that oh no for sure I just think that feels natural to me I feel like if I were to say oh I had no problem with what I did to those women and kids yeah I think that would be slightly sociopathic yeah right and I'm in I consider myself a painful empathy like for a lot of people especially you know post psychedelics and really opening and doing work on myself that that kind of shell and heaviness isn't there anymore that like need to protect my heart is not there anymore now it's like painful all the time like right before we came here there was a woman at lunch just yelling at her child and I could see that she was stressed but it was like watching the child take it oh I just I stopped eating I felt nauseous like I'm painfully empathetic now and it's almost a I almost wish it was a bit the other way it's easier how much of that do you think is a consequence of becoming a mother mean that's a big change oh yeah I don't think it's as much as I thought it would be because when I had my son I wasn't well yet so there was still that hardened part there and thank God it happened so early where he couldn't remember what I was like he gets to see happy mommy now he doesn't see Mommy crying on the stairs like he did when he was 2 and three right so how long did you search we only did a week we did a full week of just nonstop and because it was non-stop I went from alpha bravo charlie and I was shifted between every single unit so if they were kicking a door there was a women okay then I would go over there and then if they they would kick and wait and then they would go okay wait we got women and kids they put them in a room and then they would wait for me to come over here and then I would search over here and then' be the same sort thing over here there's not many of us so you're used a lot and so how did you get along with the Brits I love them how come they didn't question me they didn't make me feel like I needed to prove myself I was handed to them and they said do you know what you're doing and I said probably better than some of you and because I immediately fired back and didn't just cower into my shell they're like oh she's Lippy is she and then they started calling me the seword in a good way and I was excited about that cuz I was like oh I'm starting to be one of these people okay okay I can do this and then you're still only about 19 at this time yeah I was 19 the whole time yeah yeah and it was just they respected me if I said stop everyone stopped they weren't like oh why should we stop they were like stop Burns said stop something felt wrong and so they respected me and so I I got on with them just fine and it was really lovely there you know I had South Africans English uh Irish um uh who else is it fijians and they were just this amazing eclectic group of people and they all just were good with me there there was no questioning it at all no one was weird no one pulled any sexual stuff no one said anything offside that I considered offside it was it was a really respectful relationship and I liked it so when they respected me I was happy to be there and so we're out and we were all on hold there was a road to clear and I was had my back up against a wall and on the right hand side there was a road and then there was another compound and then uh they had a second story on that so we put a sniper up on the roof and a spotter over there and we had some guys over here waiting then we had all of us up against the wall and we had an interpreter beside me and then just down the road there was a road and it kind of went from a big open field on the right hand side and then off the road was like a deep ditch but was like super green in that ditch like they like really tall trees people don't think Afghan is like really green but it shockingly is and then at the end of it there was this massive grape Hut and they're like okay we want to clear that before we go down this road what did you call it a grape Hut so essentially it's like a mud hut with a bunch of holes in it so if you hang things through it it aerates so it'll dry things in there I see and so we sent two guys out and one had a metal detector and one was a machine gunner and he was just going to watch his back and so everyone's kind of watching this this massive open area and it got weirdly quiet and that's that's never a comfortable feeling and so we're just sitting there hanging out I actually have a photo right before it somebody took a photo of me and I'm smiling like this like it's like one of my only photos from outside the wire and next thing you know you just heard this like boom and the whole ground just like moved and I whipped my head to the left and you saw one of our guys what was left of him just boom and my eyes this was the guy with the metal detector and the machine gunner yeah the machine gunner was sitting at the door so the blast hit him to the left side and it ripped his kid off shredded his arm down his body took his like his whole helmet like I didn't understand how that happened but like everything was off of his body like that's velcroed on and like clicked in I didn't understand like what I just witnessed I couldn't I can't stress to you how foreign I didn't it there was no like I didn't get it I didn't realize what I was seeing and to the left of me all you heard was the Icom radio which is this radio that the that the um interpreters have when it's really clear we can hear the Taliban right that's how we we kind of like wire tap Taliban and so when it got really clear they were close the signal was good and it was Crystal Clear cuz they like to watch right they like to watch you blow up videotape it and use it for propaganda and they're always watching and we know that and so they did it and all you hear is and I like I'll remember that to the day I die and like the level of Rage that I did not know that could exist in a human being just overtook my entire body and I looked over at banan and I said we need to run and he goes wait and they all had radios I didn't have radios so I could just hear people screaming over radios and then next thing you know it just got chaotic quick they're like okay go go go go go go like I'm not supposed to be in this position this is not my job I don't know the hell I'm doing I'm just being doing what I'm told run run got it autopilot on so we jump down and we start running and I'm over with the medic and uh one of the guys comes he come the machine gunner comes running down and he's like I got him like he's taping him up and he's just saying where so and so where so and so and he's kind of like right out of it he just like hits him with morphine and they get him off and they're like go and so we start jumping into that ditch that hadn't been cleared and we just start running the only way I can describe it is if you listen to a movie and it's like a slow motion and you're in that black tunnel and it's just like all you can hear is like and you're running and running and you can't go like fast and I'm running with I had like 60 pounds a kit on me at the time like a like a gazelle like I'm just sprinting as fast as I can we get to the road and they're like on three run we're like one two three we run across the road and we walk in and there's some other guys that are in there and they look around and I look around and this it's like I hate that I said it but I was just kind of like where is he cuz I literally had no idea what just happened and they're like What's Left is left start grabbing things and I didn't have gloves on at the time so we started with evidence bags just putting body pieces into bags over and over and I'm was grabbing this was the man with the with the metal detector what was left of him and so we're doing that and then there was a boot he must have like hit it with his foot or the metal detector but there was a big improvised explosive device at the back end of that um grape Hut and he must have hit it and it set it off and so his boot was still in there with part of his leg but it was Lac up and dark humor boots okay and one of my buddies just tapped me on the shoulder and he's like I burnt good and that was like the moment I felt like a dissociation happened MH I called the light switch but just like we're done now bye um and I became the version of myself I was for a decade after that you call that moral injury yeah that was a good time um and so we're collecting everything and next thing you know all hell breaks loose so if you know anything about the Talan or terrorists they love a good secondary device and so they wait till everyone rushes in and then they hit you again and they did that so next thing you know mortars are I know how inaccurate those things can be so when I hear them coming down I'm like oh oh we got problems and so they start just sending mortars and our guys are like sending mortars to try to deter the Taliban that are on the line coming in and we're getting taking Small Arms fire and they call in the Pedro flights which are the two Blackhawks one's going to come in and it's going to pick up the dead and the hurt and the other's going to lay down hell and so they come in and I don't this is just chaos they go okay you need to whatever you have in your pocket's good take your weapon sling it grab his weapon put it on and then take both helmets so I do that and we start running and we're just running down this road that hadn't been cleared just going through open fire and it was the first time I'd experienced like the The Whiz and the pop really close and then we tripped and we dropped him what was left and then we had to put them all back in while this is going on and then next thing the Blackhawks show up and it was it was it was I would just didn't want to die and they came through and One landed and the one guy was just like where is he where is he and everyone's like oh we got him mate we got him we got him it's all good it's all good hit him with morphine and meanwhile he's covered up right beside um what's left with a tarp and they're just like oh he's on the next FL like he's good like just don't don't get him any more stress and so this other one comes through and this was the machine gunner yeah the machine gunner um and the other Blackhawk takes off and just we get back and I'm covered in blood and I'm taking off all the kit and putting it on there and the Machine the guy on the blackout comes through and just like just like lays down like living hell and I can't tell you how good that felt like I felt that in my bones I was like more harder do it again after that I just lost all sense of empathy and I just wanted to kill them all and I hate that I say that but I did and I don't I don't apologize for it either um and then I started to the medic caught on I'm still good friends with him did the trauma experienced to what degree do you think that was a consequence of of the Mayhem that you saw and to what degree do you think it was a consequence of that hatred I think it was uh I think at because there was a lot of other things that happened on that one that really compounded it aggressively but uh I think it was more the shock to the system of watching someone die the way I did and then the hatred came in secondary to really compound like just the pain of it all yeah well that's a real transformation of Personality yeah yeah it was not I got quiet that's how everyone caught on I just stopped talking I stopped eating I stopped sleeping but when we came back to the when we were getting everyone out right before we kicked off again I started obsessively rubbing my hands like like this and like trying to get the blood off um until this day it's what 2024 I still don't touch raw meat with bare hands I eat meat I eat predominantly only meat but I don't I don't touch it I can't touch it I haven't gone hunting yet because of it I'm really bummed about it yeah we're working on that one that's my last Bugaboo yeah yeah cuz I didn't have gloves when I was grabbing him so that was uncomfortable yeah I think that's fair to say yeah yeah so I make jokes about it now cuz it's

we just kept going and then I don't know if it was the next day or that same day cuz everything started to become a blur after that we we just started getting hit every time we walked somewhere every time we moved we were just taking it Small Arms fire mortar fire we were just getting clapped like constantly they were everywhere and so I got put in a weird situation again um I was with one of the troops I was with um Stephen um stepen Noble's guys and we were walking into a small Village and there was screaming up ahead in a compound and it was like women and whether it was like a Target or whether it was a setup or whatever that pulled us there he says we pushed into this compound like get on the roof and I was like let's go like now it's my turn right so they lift me up cuz I can't get on that roof they lift me up onto the roof and there's another guy to the right of me and then there's me and then there's a sharpshooter right beside me to the left hand side which is like a sniper but the Brits call them Sharpshooters not quite snipers um and another guy there and we are just laying down hell like I'm feeling nothing we're just laying down hell and the Sharpshooter goes I'm out of ammo I got to jump down his rifle and I'll show you a picture of it is the length of my body when I stand up from buttstock to end of barrel so I'm laying down rounds he jumps down as he jumps down on the left hand side we get flanked and three rounds go hit his butt stalk protects my hip and just misses me so after we're done the firefight we jump down and he pulls out the rifle and he pulls out the casing and I was like tell me that's mine he's like no chance you have a picture of it though and I was like that was my hip and he's like yep it was so if he was there he would it would have went through him would have hit the butt stock and hopefully would have stopped but because he wasn't there hit the butt stock and it took enough of it that it stopped it so I was very fortunate in that situation and then after that I started having uh we started just the next compound we went to I was searching a group of women and there was a particularly combative set of women here we had known at the point that this was home of the Taliban like we had we knew somebody there we knew that they were T like we knew that and so um when I was searching some of the women they chew uh there's a drug they chew there right and it makes them really disoriented and it's really hard to search them while I'm searching one of them one of them comes at me with those like um shears yeah just one of these I just I don't I wasn't issued a small arms like a handgun at all which makes no sense um and my Barrel is this long so I'm not getting that in between us so I just kind of do want this and just kind of knock her down so she's down so at least then she's diffused and it was fine but then after that what happened was I got really just angry with all of them so I started instead of taking something from them and setting it down it just was out the window out the door there was no respect anymore there was like I don't care if they're in prayer kick the door in let's go I'm not waiting for this we got places to be and you could just see it just get worse and worse and worse and we were just in firefight after firefight after firefight then our other guys got hit then we lost two interpreters then we had one of the other females there she was a mess cuz she was in right behind so now we had to get them out and it was just this it was this really really really terrible operation that just didn't go well and all of those guys I was with I bonded with and they were talking to me checking on me and listening to me or just sitting still because they knew I was not doing great um and then we got back to calf we finished the operation they picked us up we got back to calf and they said see you later and I went back to the Canadians and I was told by by a captain that how long was that period of time about a week I think it was I have the exact time stamp it was I believe it was the 9th at 0100 and then we got pulled out at 215 a.m on the 15th and um I went back to the Canadians and I was told right away to just not talk about anything that happened because no one's going to believe me anyway and then I went back out to the fob and I almost pulled a trigger on a kid because when I was doing the tower the little girl that came outside the fob all the time she was she would wave but this time I didn't see a wave I saw a gun and I racked around and the guy beside me was like yes girl like what are we doing and I just looked at him and I was like what and he was like no and I ran off the tower and I went into and I told my sergeant something's wrong wrong something's wrong and they said okay and then they sent me back to calf and then they sent me to the doctor and they said um we're seeing signs of acute postotic stress disorder we're going to put you on these pills cuz I stopped sleeping I stopped eating I did that what did they put you on I have a I have a list but there's 11 okay I have a list though so there's 11 uppers you know sleep meds anti-depressants um um any anxiety you name it just those types of medication got it yep and then um they said okay go on your hlta which is your holiday so I went to Dominican Republic with my mom for 3 weeks and in that time frame we lost more Canadians that I was with and I was angry and I drank and I was not fun to be around and I just wanted to go back and I went back I went back out to the fob told an officer off and they sent me back to calf again and they're like oh don't worry don't worry about your stuff you're coming back don't worry about it so I left all my stuff at the fob and they brought me back to the doctor and they're like this is getting worse and then they sent me to the qm which is quarter Masters where you get like your inventory stuff and they made me start counting pens and then my braid wasn't good enough so an officer a warant officer yelled at me and then I Unleashed living hell and um I was told uh had to go back to the doctors and I did and they said you're going home in 3 weeks so I went home three weeks earlier before the rest of my gun troop and I never saw the British again and I never saw my unit again and then I got back to my unit in Quebec before everyone else and they told me I was going to the hospital and see you later and then I went to the hospital in Ottawa and then I was there until they deemed me acceptable to try to retrain at the canot range and it didn't go well because I was working on a range and then they decided they were going to Med board me out in 2011 so I got Med boarded out with severe post-traumatic stress disorder and an undiagnosed traumatic brain injury and what was the traumatic brain injury from how was that acquired uh so what we understand now about machine guns Carl gustoff's artillery rounds the concussive blast off of one round will give brain damage and I did a lot of that right yeah so because we have 11 of the same 13 symptoms right so my TBI was actually a big contributing factor to why it wasn't healing but we weren't treating it because we didn't pay attention to it right because it wasn't written down right and what kind of care did you receive when you got back to Canada uh a social worker I found out recently I had a social worker at Ottawa who was trying to work with me they tried to do hypnosis they did EMDR they did medication they did um exposure therapy we did all those things and it just got worse and then the medication increased and then I moved to British Columbia with my now husband and I was given to the operational stress injury clinic in Vancouver which is an okay place but luckily Dr passy was there and he was given I was given to him and he was the gentleman that you mentioned ear psychiatrist yeah yeah and he was helpful I still work with him weekly why was he helpful what did he do right he had walked the walk so I know know he understood so I didn't have to explain myself to him mhm and he gave me the space and didn't tell me I was broken he said I see this all the time you're going to be fine kid MH just give me time and I said okay and the idea of being the only suicide he ever had like would haunt I couldn't do that I didn't live because of me or wanting to be here I lived because I had an obligation to others mhm and so who my now husband I've been with for 14 years I met him right before deployment and then I moved up you right about that yeah yeah yeah and um I just can't I can't let people down it's like the it's like it's like the worst so so I stuck around how are you doing fantastic how come psychedelics Community purpose love all of it in combination M the Catalyst point though with my husband did the best he could for as long as he could my psychiatrist has never failed me but what I had lost and people don't really talk about this when you transition out of anything professional sports military police going into the civilian world it's not the same and if you lose that that Community right so you're hurt and you don't have an identity yeah and I was told that 21 I'd never work again so that's a great label so you have post-traumatic stress is where you're never going going to work again and you're broken we become the stories we tell ourselves we know that so I told myself I'm the injured veteran who's never going to work or get better because that's what I was told so why wouldn't I believe that by the people who are trained experts in their fields and it was only when my doctor said to me one day like we know you want to get pregnant but you can't be on some of these pharmaceutical meds so what about cannabis and I was like I grew up like that's a no no like no no he give it a try and I was like okay so I slowly started to integrate cannabis and remove sleep medication MH and that worked then we got down to the last what did cannabis do for you it allowed me to get to sleep and stay asleep oh yeah okay yeah because my problem was waking up from nightmares and the night sweats I was really violent at night when I'd sleep and so I was never sleeping so I was never resting and we know that was it Tak 72 hours a break someone without sleep it's not it's not much and so from there on I said okay I'm going to go down this more holistic route and I started my art therapy my doctor suggested art therapy I started on the kitchen table in 2015 I started building uh bracelets out of old spent casings that my friends would send me from the range which I found out really quickly was illegal when the RCMP cornered off my culde sack and showed up out my door with guns they were like so do you have rounds in there and I was like nope I'm like do you have a warrant they're like nope like seven ,50 Cal rounds on the other side of that door they just they weren't actual they were just casings but you can't take those so I was building jewelry out of them and I slowly started to develop this purpose and I never wanted to run a nonprofit but I wanted to impact our community and I didn't know how so I was like well if I can make something then that can be the vehicle that puts that money with those Charities that's going to do the boots on the ground work so then I'm impacting change and I'm funding something so that was my mentality going into the business what did grow into brass and unity now is oh my gosh uh so brass and unity I mean it took off in 2016 I met with Kevin Hart and he gave me the best piece of advice I've ever been given which was at the time it was called her wearables he goes you need to make it a unisex name and I was like right so we did he tweeted it out and a a year later I was on Ellen and it you know Julian Huff and Michael bé and all these people started wearing it for suicide prevention and I was like okay we're cooking with something then next thing you know we were nominated for what were you making that they were wearing just these these uhhuh just bullet jewelry like with actual like casings that's it oh yeah yeah oh yeah just pull use your muscles I believe in you thank you thank you sorry I'm a positive affirmation individual yeah well those are very nicely made thank you yeah so I started making these and then we started selling them in the Fashion World now let me tell you about the fashion world and bullet casing it doesn't mix I don't know if you know that uh it seems it seems logical yes right so long and short it end up kind of skyrocketing and we by 2019 we were in L fashion magazine all of these things all these stories all these celebrities 200 retailers I had hand signed myself just hustling my way through North America and Co hit and I lost my entire business overnight talk about a lack of purpose having your whole identity wrapped around a jewel company that was a bad idea isn't it well it worked it did its job it did what I needed to do it got me up it got me moving it got me not want to kill myself every day so all in that time frame I got married I had a baby ran this business and then 20121 kicks over and I get this phone call again from the same guy who introduced me to iasa so in that time frame I started getting really suicidal Again by 2019 I was drowning I couldn't figure why I'm doing all the things I'm I'm doing what I'm told I'm trying all the exposure therapies and the why isn't it working and my buddy calls and he said hey what about um iasa Griff's like you know do you know of heroic Hearts I said no they said they take veterans to do iasa I was like what's iasa they're like this tea and I'm like all right let's do it last last kick at the can give it an honest try 30 days later I went and did it with a group of operators and black Blackwater dudes and Army Rangers and I realized in that moment it was less about the iasa and more about the community I was welcome I was brought in again I was seen so we did iasa for three days in the woods three days yeah and my life changed what did you learn that the way that I was taught that God exists isn't true that God is everything and that I wasn't going to go to hell because I wanted tattoos and that there was nothing wrong with my head and that I was going to be okay if I just had faith in something bigger than myself that was when what year was that 2020 2020 mhm so after that I've never been on a pharmaceutical drug again H is that right from that point from that point wow yeah we're going into 20 202 soon here how is you sleeping fantastic well that's a good deal well it's a combination of that and brain treatment I did in 2022 what did you do so I went down to this place um called resiliency brain health center in Dallas Texas they treat Army Rangers Delta operators you know NFL dudes and what had happened was in 2021 from starting that my podcast um I met Griff within the first four episodes so I did psychedelics and that carried me through and I integrated that I did psychedelics like I did iasa again that October and then after that I had some really popular people on the podcast and this organization was like um something's wrong with her eyes and the only reason that happened is because my husband started dying so all while this is happening in Co my husband and I were in the garage and we're watching a Joe Rogan podcast literally the same pattern of behavior we have every day and I was smoking a joint before bed he'd sit in the garage with me while we just have this like routine he looks at me and he goes Kelsey something's wrong and he grabbed his right side and I did my paramedics after I got home from the Army and I was like wrong side BR he goes no something's wrong and he stood up and he goes I think I'm dying and he dropped with the ground and he just was gone and so talk about move slow again I started screaming we called 911 they put us on hold I said I got a new Tesla let's let's test this thing out so my neighbor came and put him in the car for me and we drove him to the hospital in less than 5 minutes and the ambulance called and like pull over Beat it I'm gonna get there faster than you Canada didn't help Canada kept telling us it was mental health it was not mental health my husband was a professional Super Cross racer he's hit his head more times than he can count but what we're starting to understand about TBI is they can be delayed he was fine until he wasn't everything started to spiral after that he couldn't get out of bed his depression he started getting suicidal he was losing weight he wasn't functioning he just didn't want to live anymore and he couldn't figure out what was wrong we went to every hospital we did private doctors MRIs you name it they're like it's mental health it's mental health like it's not mental health friend of mine was on Instagram and was like I'm at this brain Clinic I have too many head injuries so I voice messaged him I was a ranger and I was just balling I said will you help me I don't know what to do can you get them to see my husband this was Wednesday we called them they said this is no problem know what it is he was on a flight and he was there on Sunday Canada two years nothing nowhere nothing one week Texas yeah so we went down there and he was there and they also treat civilians and this was who treats the veterans the resiliency clinic and so this this lovely lady named Donna Cranston who runs Defenders of Freedom sat down and she goes is your wife Kelsey Sharon and he goes uh yes ma'am goes we think she has a TBI her eyes are all messed up on her podcast we'd like to treat her and I was like okay I'm like you know she's Canadian like we're going to get special permission don't worry and they funded the whole thing so they flew me down to Texas for two weeks after I did the 4x4 by 48 with uh another charity because goggin likes to make the rest of us suffer and um I went right there right after and I was there for a two-e intensive program and I found out that I not only had a TBI I had disautonomia in pots and that's one of the reasons I wasn't getting better my vestibular system was completely aak my hormones were a complete nightmare you name it I couldn't tilt my head backwards without my whole body thinking I Wasing upside down I was CAU I was couldn't drive a car I was getting nauseous all the time couldn't be in a you know passenger seat so I did treatment with them and then uh I continued to use things like micro doing to help not all the time I do regiments eight weeks at a time and then I go off and I integrate um but I still definitely have a tendency when I get depression I don't go as low as I did but I go a little but enough to go okay we need to are we sleeping are we eating right are we moving enough are we having enough water what was I watching was it triggering was it Tucker Caron all week maybe let's take a let's take a break let's go into something a little lighter and so I start looking at all those things before I go to the next solution and all in that time frame I you know wanted to help veterans differently so we donate 20% of our proceeds from brass and unity I started journaling and writing a book I started this podcast that was kind kind of taking off and then I was like might as well become a psychedelic integration coach so then I can help these same people that help me and that's what I did and then now cut to where we are in 2024 where the book came out last year and um I'm healthy and I'm happy and I love myself and I know my worth and I know where I'm going and I have a direction and I am so godamn grateful for the people I have around me because without them I wouldn't have been here and they didn't give up on me our government gives up on everyone else but no one gave up on me and it's only because they didn't get a hold of me in time because if they did I wouldn't be here all right ma'am thank you very much for walking us through that so for everybody watching and listening I'm going to continue to talk to Kelsey for another half an hour on the daily wire side um I'm not exactly sure what we'll talk about maybe the maybe more about the state of the military in Canada and uh
