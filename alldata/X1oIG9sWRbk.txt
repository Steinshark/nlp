ladies and gentlemen if you know anything about the game of chess then you know that the best player in the world is named Magnus Carlson you also know that my channel is essentially a PR friend for all things Magnus Carlson uh and yesterday he did something extremely Sensational and I had to share it with all of you Magnus played in the chess.com title Tuesday tournament and he went 11-0 he played 11 games he won all 11 games he beat people like Hikaru Fabiano caruana and other Grandmasters and he made it look completely effortless he completely decimated the field it was not even close and I'm going to share highlights of every single one of those games with you right now so yeah from my hotel room in Europe to all of you at home uh let's enjoy Magnus Carlson absolutely embarrassing and demolishing absolutely everybody in his way I said absolutely twice but I'm not going to re-record um when is the last time you did something 11 times correctly in a row I feel like you probably can't even like urinate 11 times in a row correctly you probably like pee on the floor or something I like seriously I mean 11-0 is like seriously impressive stuff so Magnus begins title Tuesday uh with the white pieces uh against a 2500 rated player and he begins with the bird opening because you know why not uh he plays then E4 so now it's a French defense with opponent F4 uh he plays E5 so it's kind of like an advanced French type of thing and we get a position where he dances the Knight to C2 and plays the move d4 all right looks like a pretty reasonable position for white um his opponent was very aggressive early trying to trade off pieces trying to attack magnus's King Magnus built up a very nice dark squared Pawn formation and then Magnus put all his pawns on dark squares to activate dark Pawn Jutsu A4 it's a real real thing chess.com will drop down a little achievement and tell you you managed to put all your pawns on dark squares in the game that's not actually true and then then Magnus attacked his opponent's Kingwood G4 his opponent played King H1 King h8 and Magnus kept attacking King on H1 King on h8 absolutely nothing in front of the king at all we're still playing the pawn to H4 he's able to play this because the center is completely deadlocked and that makes attacking a lot easier his opponent tries to fight back Magnus plays H5 anyway his opponent tries to fight back Magnus is like you know Consuela from Family Guy when she's just like no that's essentially how Magnus plays against lower rated players he's just like no I I win there's there's just not much you can do it's just Bishop E3 you play F4 like his opponent actually is playing very very decently like very decently fighting back not letting himself get bullied The Rook goes back to f8 Magnus plays King H2 and the queen goes back and like his opponent is actually doing a a pretty decent job and it it's just a matter of time I mean Magnus Just Dances around with his King he's actually an a bad position but it's just a matter of time he wins the opponent F4 rotates the queen over jumps in with the Knight And Trades down into a winning end game because if you take the bishop on the G7 so Rook F3 King G4 this is hanging this is hanging his opponent resides that was game number one game number one of title Tuesday is always a little bit shaky you don't know what what's gonna happen but the rest of it was hilarious Magnus won all his games by also disrespecting his opponents every step of the way he would play A6 Magnus played A6 every game with the black pieces I'm not exaggerating in the second game of title Tuesday he played a 2600 rated player because that's what happens in tournaments you go up like that and then he played a Karo Khan he played H6 he took an E4 and he turned the game into kind of like a weird Caro thing he allowed the Knight to go to D6 this looks very annoying but he just gave a check traded put the queen in the center and broke with E5 Castle long and then traded everything down into this end game which no human on the planet should lose to any other human on the planet unless you're playing Magnus it's rook and Knight versus rook and Bishop and it's completely symmetrical but he's Magnus so he's going to win he also missed something really funny there was a stockfish line here he took on E5 sacrificing his Queen to take and then take the queen back but actually his opponent could have played King F1 and if Magnus had gone here after Rook d8 he would have actually been losing so sometimes you gotta avoid a few things against the uh the 2600s you know what happens Magnus brings his King he trades the Rooks again no human should lose this to any other human on the planet Magnus advances his pawns he creates a very strong post there takes with the Knight brings the Knight back to the center and it's just a matter of time as he has completely Frozen the side of the board but his opponent only has 10 seconds loses upon trades down to into a losing King and pawn end game and Magnus is going to Queen with check and that is why he is going to win this race and there it is one square before queening it's check and if we go back just a little bit Magnus knew that was going to happen all the way back here check take the bishop and he knew he was going to win the race because after King G5 the King has to take both pawns because otherwise the pawn cannot get through so white takes both pawns and lands on the Square that geometrically loses him the game and it took a little while but his opponent resigned 2-0 now it's time to go up and up now we're going to face 2750 actually I know the person that he's playing here with the black piece is very strong uh young player from the US I've actually played uh Jessica inclined many times Jessica had a rough game this game um probably part of that was the fact that his opponent was named Magnus Carlson it was a rue Lopez it was a Berlin and it was D4 which is sort of like a really weird Berlin he gave up both Center pawns but he starts firing away at his opponent Knight takes C6 there's a line here Bishop takes H2 is a super crazy move King H1 and now you have to play Queen H4 you have to go here and Jessica forgot that and did this first and unfortunately after this this I don't have to take your Rook you see if I take your Rook Knight takes F2 wins me the queen but before that I just do this and that's it and and and then black resigns so Magnus plays a kind of a edgy sideline against the Spanish his opponent doesn't remember all the Cutting Edge lines loses unfortunately in 14 moves because that's the way chess goes sometimes Magnus is 3-0 okay well his next game is with the black pieces and he's playing Vincent kaima German player from this point forward Magnus is only going to play 2900s three thousands and 3 100 rated players and he's still going to win every game spoiler alert sorry so Magnus begins this game it's insane right it's insane Vincent turns the game into a London basically arguing that the move A6 is stupid so Magnus responds by londoning the London he's like you want to play the London against me all right let's do it his opponent turns it into a Queen's Gambit and now it's like black has played some sort of weird Queen's Gambit with a Pawn on A6 magazine 56 just completely unconcerned puts up a little Triangle Pawn setup Magnus is now trying to get the Jutsu of the light squared pawns he just needs to play G6 Queen B3 targets the pawns on Magnus plays Queen C7 Magnus is not a guy who lightly pushes his pawns like he does not want to play moves like B5 if he can help himself he's going to develop his Queen Rook C1 and just look at this I mean this is so funny staring into the eyes of danger because the Rook is completely unguarded so there's no useful Discovery I mean you can play an id2 but something tells me Magnus is going to see that bishopy too Rook C8 now if you move the Knight for example Knight takes D5 Magnus is gonna sacrifice his Queen you know why he's sacrificing his Queen because he can that's it that is literally the reason Knight H4 and the way Magnus is going to end up winning this game is he's going to by the way by the way by the way by the way by the way by the way all pawns on light squares so Magnus has put all his pawns on dark squares he has put all his pawns on light squares he is unlocked he's doing side quests in the middle of title Tuesday and he sacrifices The Rook to get to an end game where he has two pieces for a rook and the computer evaluates this as equal but it's not it's not equal because one of the opponents is the best endgame player probably of all time unless you want to make an argument that it's capablanca we go to a queenless end game Magnus has his two pieces versus The Rook two pieces are going to be to Rook like eight times out of ten and this game is no different has Magnus lands of fork immediately and white resigns but the truth is it was already very difficult for white um because absolutely everything in Black's position is defending everything else and it was just a matter of time for black you know to go here Knight D5 Rook B2 and just start hunting down all the weak Pawns in the white position and black has absolutely no risk for a no while playing A6 now his next opponent is three thousand okay which you know 3000 is a very impressive rating when you play somebody like myself Magnus is 243 points higher rated than this person which is so stupid I mean that's just I can't believe his rating is that high this is Anton karaboff you would not know that from his legal name on chess.com which is go gif I don't I have absolutely no idea what this means by the way if anybody can tell me I would be really impressed Magnus plays B3 this game nimso Larson completely normal stuff plays D4 um and in this game we're going to see Magnus not disrespecting his opponent not playing anything stupid or ridiculous but rather a beautiful attacking game of chess he plays A3 B3 to prevent anything from coming over here he plays Queen E2 Knight E5 centralizing and the second his opponent castles there goes the warning shot Pawn to G4 with ideas of Pawn to G5 obviously with ideas of H4 H5 and with the idea to Castle queenside opposite side castling the gloves are off it's a hockey fight at the Face-Off Knight to G6 he takes and now Magnus plays King B1 and King A2 because he needed to evacuate his King to safety before starting his own attack he could have maybe played H4 but Queen E7 looks really unpleasant and you might just need to go H5 and just kind of go for it Magnus isn't like that he's a calculated cold-blooded killer Rook C7 and now he plays H4 and now he plays Rook H3 and there's just absolutely nothing black can do black probably needs to sack The Rook that's like literally what you might have to do to slow white down but 94 by corabov Magnus just takes and now he just gets rid of the C Pawn as a weakness altogether so maybe now black has to play things like B5 but instead korob plays F5 Magnus plays H5 he's knocking on the door of the king side H6 and H7 and let me tell you right now this bishop on B2 is going to absolutely Slaughter the king in the corner magnus's H Pawn waltzes through the position he shreds it open entirely utilizing all of the open lines and he ends the game in style Knight takes E4 why Knight takes E4 because of this and because of this The Rook is not actually hanging because if you take it Queen to G8 and then I promote to a new queen and I got news for you I don't even care if you take the Rook that's literally my threat because I will promote to a queen and it will be made in fact the position is so disrespectful you can take this and promote to a rook I don't know why it's not letting me but maybe it's because it's a capture you could promote to a double Rook Checkmate that is how brutal Magnus attacked core above in this game this man sealed off all of Black's pieces look at this cluster of pieces that literally never participated in the game they just never got a chance to move all of korob's pieces stood Frozen as Magnus bashed open the position and one in style folks look at the position after Rook C7 Black's pieces literally never moved they were frozen as Magnus infiltrated and brutalized the black king I mean it's just insane 5-0 next opponent Dennis lazovic strong Grandmaster from Belarus a young player like 16 17 years old d4a6 doesn't matter now we go back to akaro Khan this time it's an exchange variation and black has played the move A6 which is really not a very useless move Magnus plays Knight E7 plays F6 and brings the bishop back to the F7 Square from where he wants to play the move E5 then he lands a knight into the center of the board we have Queen to B4 offering a queen trade and we get a queenless middle game this is still a middle game I would say because so many pieces are on the board but it may be very early stage end game black has good chances here against this pawn and against these two pawns let's see what Magnus does he plays root B8 which looks very ugly but the idea is probably to mobilize the pawns very soon or rotate The Rook back to the center it's a very locked position very big maneuvering game here and now we have a trade leaving black with this kind of ugly Bishop so let's see how Magnus is going to put it to the test B6 first we kick the Knight out then we kick out the Rook then we put Rook C8 and and Rook C1 and we trade off one Rook do we trade off the second Rook okay we kick out the night the night goes back to A2 and at some point we're gonna activate our Bishop there's the bishop and the bishop is going to infiltrate you can't really take me probably because I'm going to dislodge the defender of this Pawn lasovic plays Knight B5 here comes the king oh Bishop comes in Bishop comes back King to d8 he gets a couple of Pawns Knight takes D4 it's a mad scramble it's four pawns each is magnus's three gonna be broken here we have a king Bishop King Knight end game it's a king race the bishop goes to D5 the king is active G5 A4 taking away all of white space uh oh and it's a mouse slip deep deep deep in the tank G takes H4 was what white wanted to play and this game would have went on for a while and probably white would have drawn it because I just don't think there is enough here but of course Magnus would have posed as many problems as possible well he posed time problems in this game and his opponent played G4 and that's just the end you gotta get a little bit lucky sometimes to get 11-0 just like you have to get a little bit lucky to win the World Series of Poker 6-0 The Big Three are yet to come his next opponent is Matthias bluebomb this time he plays A3 with white dude this man just won't stop I mean this is the most disrespectful thing on like he's playing A3 with white now D5 now he plays a London with white he played a London with black with the move A3 now he's playing in London with white Bishop D6 he takes on C5 and he kind of turns it into a little Queen's Gambit decline type of situation okay Rook D1 Bishop E2 relatively symmetrical may be slightly better for white E4 taking a little bit of space E5 taking a little bit of space but blue bomb is doing a good job here queenie2 and it's time to attack the black king symmetrical Pawn structure DNC pawns missing from both sides takes takes blue bomb plays the move Rook to d8 looking to trade the Rooks Magnus plays Bishop D3 and now H5 and Knight E4 and then I jumps into D6 now black is still doing okay here according to the computer prior to that move but too many tactics Bishop hits this bishop hits this and blue bomb has to go here lose his Rook Bishop takes E6 is a discovered attack on the queen you cannot take the bishop and Magnus escapes with an extra exchange and when it's all said and done he's just going to be up a comfortable amount of material in the end game is this drawable because all the pawns are on the same side Maybe could stockfish dry it against the human maybe but Magnus is not just human he is kind of a juggernaut so it's rook in two versus knight and two but the pawns are not the same Magnus walks his King forward pushes the black King backwards centralizes his King G3 pokes and pokes and pokes and there's the king and the Pawn's not going anywhere because the Rook can always come back to stop it and the Black Knight and black king and black pawn are immobile it takes some 60 60 moves but Magnus simplifies into a winning King and pawn end game and uh checkmates his opponents and moves later effortless for him aidano 7-0 I don't even know seven seven no I think I've given him an extra point next game he's playing Fabiano A6 this man played Fabiano caruana in a world championship match and he's playing A6 against them in title Tuesday Fabi plays C4 which is probably the critical move because it prevents black from playing a normal looking Carl Kanki plays D5 anyway it prevents black from playing defunct Knight F6 now it's like some weird cairo-esque position right Bishops are out Bishop H5 Fabi developing very nicely uh pushes his pieces back rookie one Rook C1 Magnus plays F5 fighting for the light scores on the king side because Knight E5 initiating complications Magnus takes this Pawn because this Pawn has to guard the Knight five goes here Bishop takes E2 first and now Fabi sneaks in Bishop F4 Bishop is still hanging and there's some discovered attacks here G5 that's a Chad move leaves the bishop hanging thrusts upon in front of his own King and threatens to get tripled pawns Fabi goes rookie one extremely tense game where all of magnus's position is kind of put to the test rookie seven now here come the Rooks they get traded off it's Queen and Bishop versus queen at night there is no way Fabi can lose this position right the queen slides in but it doesn't really matter because the king is safe Bishop G7 looking for Bishop here and then Queen to G1 mate Fabi plays Queen D1 back A5 that pawn is is asking questions okay but there's no way there's no way you can lose this with white right it's kind of a fortress he's taking away his squares but how is he going to win the position threatening a queen trade the king is walking to the center of the board oh my God he's walking his King and he's eating fabi's pawns Queen to D1 was threatening mate and King C4 and Magnus wins this game by walking his King to the other side of the board when all things were equal when it looked like white had set up a very nice defensive Fortress where he protected everything in his position the way Magnus won this game with tripled isolated F pawns last time I've seen three F's is on your report card he walked his King to the other side of the board to join the party the king just took a journey facilitated the advancement of the pawn and he won the game against Fabiano caruana in style A1 is Unstoppable Fabi never had a chance to break forward with any of these pieces I don't know next game he's playing against Baku Boulevard uh this is um Ralph momidov I believe E4 C5 and this time we have Bishop B5 check we actually have a normal game um no A3 Magnus attacks in the center gets the two Bishops and then gives it right back in order to control some squares on the side of the board develops his night out to C4 to control more dark squares develops all the rest of his pieces literally Rogue Bishop Queen everybody gets a turn now that Rook goes to the B file and now as always H4 his opponent plays Knight E7 we go to a this is an end game I would say Pawn to C3 offering up this Pawn for the B7 Pawn his opponent says yes his opponent takes on A5 Magnus takes Rook takes bishop and now it's Rooks and multiple pawns on the board Knight back to C4 in fact Magnus is actually trailing by a pawn but it's going to be very difficult for his opponent to defend the rest of these pawns and uh it's just a matter of time King back to G8 Knight goes to E3 and we have four pawns each in a knight versus Bishop Rook end game centralized night brings up the king kicks Out The Rook back to the G6 square and activates the king a little bit further it's a slightly better position for white but he is up one and a half minutes on the clock he pushes the black Rook into defense and as always Magnus trades one Rook if you want to win a rook end game a good way to do it is to trade one Rook obviously momentov doesn't want a rook trade but it's just a matter of time I mean yes the position is equal but there's a lot of questions being asked black has 20 seconds versus magnus's 150 and if you're gonna play a Blitz game it's your responsibility to manage your time wisely it's just a matter of time Magnus is going to find different angles and approaches to infiltrate and post problems and and he does get his Rook trade he hits the F7 pawn and he removes the defender of the bishop and he wins the game in style 9-0 his biggest test is yet to come in the form of Hikaru there it is this is the matchup that we tune in for every single time we get a title Tuesday it's exactly what we want it's the equivalent of watching the two biggest kids in school fight on the playground every Friday or Thursday or anytime they want to fight and Magnus starts this game against Hikaru with the move basics very nice he's been playing A6 the entire title Tuesday I'm actually kind of shocked Hikaru didn't go for A3 instead he plays D4 and he actually disallows Magnus from playing the move D5 but this is an over commitment I mean I'm not coaching Hikaru he obviously knows what he's doing um he just didn't want Magnus to play D5 it was kind of more of like a psychological thing it's a little bit of an over commitment though because black doesn't actually have to take and can just play Knight F6 and now both of these pawns are kind of Under Fire but that was all part of hikaru's plan takes takes oh excuse me takes E5 so now the Knight has to go this is all part of the the Hikaru strategy Knight takes D5 now Magnus plays here but Hikaru runs into some problems here with Queen A5 check and losing the pawn in E5 like again I don't really know if this was pre-planned but he's just a pawn down with the white pieces what he does have going for him however is the fact that the black queen can sort of be used like a pinata and now he activates his Queen so it's just total chaos Hikaru is fighting fire with fire the Knight is hanging the pawn is hanging the Bishops are staring at each other he's gonna Castle long maybe he's gonna put his Knight on D6 Magnus plays D5 Hikaru grabs the pawn on G7 forcing Magnus to move his Rook now he can't Castle takes takes it's a fire Fight Night back to E3 the queen pokes at the B2 Pawn you can't actually Castle because Knight takes F2 is going to be a fork so we have Rook to be one Knight to C6 developing and Knight Hikaru goes here and removes the knight from the center of the board before playing Queen F6 Queen F4 but now F5 and E5 is a problem because E5 is going to be the start of a pawn Avalanche so Hikaru plays Knight C4 and now Queen C7 and the players begin shuffling moves now I really wonder if after Queen C7 there was anything better than Queen to d8 this might have been the moment this could have been the moment that Magnus would have gotten his title Tuesday ruined on the perfect run because I'm not sure there's much better after Queen to C7 maybe Magnus would have tried to go for something and just take a worse position but Hikaru is the one who chooses not to repeat moves but now E5 and Bishop to E6 and probably the most gangster move of this game was played right here Hikaru was like well I'm gonna play F3 because magnus's King is in the center I'm gonna play F3 I'm gonna get my knight out I'm gonna castle and I'm gonna smack him down the f-file and I have Knight D6 so Hikaru plays F3 and Magnus says call an ambulance call an ambulance but not for me King to G8 Magnus manually castles she doesn't Castle in one move he has to walk his King out of danger to the castling position and now it's actually white who is going to get butchered on the f-file and in just literally three moves the position goes from worse to e takes F3 losing for white because the Knight on C4 is on pre Hikaru has to lose a couple of Pawns but Magnus now approaches the queen comes in pawns who have three and it's game over in 35 moves as Magnus plays Rook takes D6 this and this and this is on the way and Hikaru resigns 10 and oh this man cannot be denied and you already knew when he got to 10-0 Ain't No Way was this man not going to win the final game of title Tuesday Alexander Bortnick in his way Magnus goes for a double fee and keto plays D3 Knight D2 and plays Rook A2 and queen A1 now this looks like Magnus is disrespecting his opponent um he is but this is actually a real strategy I mean it looks kind of absurd but and if you do this you should be banned from chess but he knows what he's doing the point is that now he has a Target from the corner of the board and he also can now double his Rooks kind of at will and it's an end game it's an eight Pawn middle game it's a it's an end game the more pieces we trade and Magnus begins marching his opponent down 10-0 the bull going straight at the Matador waving the red flag this is essentially what this position is is Magnus going to successfully March his opponent down or will he be repelled cb5 Magnus takes that way so that the Knight takes and there we go the imbalance has been created it's only four pawns for black it's five for white and this Pawn might be a liability for black Rook A2 Magnus goes for the bishop versus knight end game and you know what if Rook takes D5 were to be played you know what Magnus would have done he would have traded the Rooks he would have traded the Rooks and he would have tried to go or he would have played Rook B7 Rook C8 he would have tried to go for that type of end game Ed Bishop F5 here comes the king he is unafraid it's a rook end game he's pretty damn good at those Rook takes B7 Rook back to B4 and he's up a pawn it might be equal according to stockfish his opponent is not stockfish Magnus marching forward King F3 King F2 might be a draw might be holdable but it's probably just a matter of time as the advantages growing the King has pushed back the Deep on advances and it's just a matter of time until black has to resign Magnus transforms the game into a winning King and pawn end game as he has done so many times in this video promotes to a queen 74 moves game over title Tuesday over 11 and oh in a variety of different ways and styles and ridiculous openings and configurations Magnus beats an average rating pool of like 3 000 plus 6 grand Masters at times it looked dicey but it was never in doubt 11 games 11 wins stockfish level performance what more do we want more do we want you know what I want I want you to get out of here
