Hello everyone, and.. welcome as the title suggests, I literally just ran my S2000 into that uh, those shelves right there um... and so I'm gonna show you what happened on the other side,  and its not too terrible but I want to give some context as far as whats going on behind the scenes so I've been working with this company called XPEL, to put a clear bra on my S2000 and before I did that I wanted to make sure, that I was gonna repaint the front bumper because the front bumper has a lot of rock chips dents and debris have been kinda taken out a bit on the very front on that front lip so I wanted to get that sanded down, repainted ready to go before putting on the clear bra on the car Now.. I just came to an agreement, literally today with this company, and we said let's go ahead, let's do this And so, I was like, Great, we going to go move forward I was looking at body shops to have this front bumper repainted Aaaand I was going to the gym I know it doesn't look like I go there very often It's a rock gym, skinny people can excel there uhh Rock climbing gym I should say And, I thought, you know I haven't driven my S2000 in a good while good to get all the fluids circulating, things like that so I was like, I'll take the S2000, It's a nice sunny day And, I thought to myself before, you know maybe I shouldn't maybe I should just get this thing fixed get this you know sponsor video that's gonna come up out of the way and make sure everything goes smoothly but no, I had to drive my car aaand i thought to myself, you know, what if something gets messed up and sure enough I am the reason that that happened I ran into my own garage So, when I park in here, I intentionally park very close to that wall very close to those shelves because I want to have enough space between my S2000 and my Crosstrek so that I can open the doors and not have them hit each other so you know a passenger gets in they don't have to worry about it, they got plenty of space to get in and I can get in my S2000, open the door wide open and crawl in so in trying to avoid damage I damaged my car :( um.. so not thrilling and all of this was because I was planning to have the front bumper repainted and fix the car, and now I'm going to have the front fender replaced because I've damaged it So first things first, here is the very obvious of where I ran into these shelves on the side here, you can see the yellow paint taken off from my car. This is what i looked at first and then my heart kinda sank, and I felt crushed and so... Here we can see the actual damage (warning) That occured to the fender.. so, punched in there uh, it does look like the bumper itself is kinda bent downward a little bit and you can see, of course, you've got the cracking of the paint there the fender is all punched in um.. and you can see that it no longer is flush with the body so the bumper itself is popped up here where as on the other side you know you've got a nice smooth panel gap and you know and very small panel gap there VS, going back to what I just did... all busted up and crushed in this side right here so pretty frustrating and very likely that this will need to get replaced I'm hoping that this isn't bent enough that we can maybe still use it, but I dont know if you know because of how much work will have to go into sanding it it might be cheaper to just end up replacing it and repainting it, all together Now I want to talk a brief moment about happiness um, and why I'm not, you know, totally devastated I was extremely frustrated when I first pulled in and scraped it, and looked at the wall, and saw the paint and thought, oh God, what have I just done? um, it's very frustrating, and I try not to get angry about things like this, but it is extremely frustrating I think the key to happiness and not getting super mad in these scenarios is to be grateful and to be grateful, is to appreciate what you have and I have alot I do not need this car, it is purely a toy there is absolutely no need for me to have it I have it because I want to have it it is purely for my own joy And so because of that, if it gets damaged, it's just a toy it's not a part of my life that's necessary and I shouldn't get upset about it and that's the way I try to approach it and so, I'm I'm not, you know honestly the car can be fixed, the most frustrating part is, I think that that fender has to be replaced and now there no longer is an original fender on there It's going to be you know, an OEM replacement of course but it won't be the stock fender that came on the vehicle which will be dissapointing then of course, there is a monetary value lost I'm losing money because I damaged my car I have to pay for it to get fixed part of that If you watched the ad before this video Thank you, you are actually helping me pay for that and if you didn't watch the ad Thank you regardless, because you're the reason I get to have this YouTube channel and do what I do and I tremendously appreciate that regardless of if you watch the ads or not so, you know you're the reason why I get to keep doing this and thank you for watching I do have plans for this S2000 this is just a little, you know, speed bump that I gotta deal with Uh, I have brakes they're in my house, ready to put on it some new brakes, and I'm going to do some performance testing with those Uh, I have a special part getting made Uh, which will be shipped across the pacific, which I'm pretty excited about Um, and I do want to supercharge this thing eventually there are some other things I'm doing in between those projects clearly, I want to get this clear bra put on and I wanna get Uh, the front bumper repainted, and I want to get that fender fixed uh, so yea, it's uh, it's uh road block that I have to deal with, it's uh an inconvenience, it sucks, it costs money but ultimately, this thing is a toy this thing is purely for entertainment and as a result, you know I have to be grateful of the position that I have and not angry, you know, that I damaged it but rather appreciate that I get to do this at all Soo.. Thank you guys for watching um, if you have any questions or comments, feel free to leave them below if you know some really good shops in the Boise, Idaho area which are great for repairing and especially matching paint colors, that's what I'm most concerned about feel free to leave some suggestions I do have shops I've already been referenced, so I've got an idea of where I'm going but if you guys have had personal experiances with some shops in the Boise, Idaho area let me know.
