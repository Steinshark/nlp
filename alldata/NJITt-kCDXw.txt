ladies and gentlemen the game of chess is closely associated with intelligence mental capability and critical thinking but not in this video in today's video I'm going to throw all of that out the window and I'm going to show you a brand new chess opening for you to test run called the egg the egg e g g the egg opening you can play it with white you can play it with black and the egg is kind of a Gambit in the sense that you were going to be inflicting tremendous psychological pressure and emotional damage to your opponents after you defeat them and if you lose well it started the game with a little bit of a handicap I'm gonna play three games today against my subscribers shout out to them for volunteering themselves they have no idea what they've gotten themselves into I just asked for volunteers for Blitz and I'm going to show you how to play the egg if you clicked on this video with the intention of becoming a grand master or a world champion yes sorry that's not gonna happen but but we are gonna have a lot of fun uh and you can test run this as much as you'd like all right the first game this is actually against a moderator uh of my channel shout out to Vlad this person is 1800 okay and I'm starting with E and I'm going to play G and then I'm going to play G again um unless that happens you see if your opponents develop in a way where they covered that square you might need to add an H Pawn before you do it you could play the egg Gambit which is G4 um but it's egg the egg this will be like the egg you know so I'm gonna play this I'm trying to play the egg you know again if if my opponent had not played this move wow that's extremely disrespectful my opponent is trying to stop me from playing the egg that's wild y'all clicked on this my opponent had no idea what they were trying to do but I guess that's what happens when you get an 1800 well if they play H5 the good news is you're still gonna learn something I'm not gonna exactly get the egg but they have overcome wait now I can just play the egg again it just blocked this okay I'll do it maybe that was on purpose um maybe that was on purpose maybe they felt bad that they were that they were getting uh getting rid of my egg now I can play G5 so the Rooks have been traded we've now completely cut off this rectangle of the board I'm attacking the knight uh and uh now the egg opening actually was first I think seen somewhere in an Eric Rosen video like I'm not the inventor of this opening um it actually the way it came onto my radar was by a good friend of mine as a student and that student told my friend and I was like oh that's really funny this opening looks hilarious I might go test you know test run it and then it turned out that it was like deep somewhere in a viewer Challenge on an Arabic Rosen video so maybe that viewer in Eric rosen's video invented the egg that might be the whole lore um the pawn is under attack I want to go here but first actually I want to develop my queen because I don't want to block my queen in when I when I when I kick the Knight out like and also when I play Knight F3 so I'm expecting this or this at which point I will play Knight F3 defending my pawn and then I'm gonna go here also I can go here so I'm expecting my opponent to play G6 which is a a very natural move in fact a very good move uh okay there's nothing wrong with that move um D3 kicking out the Knight and this kind of shows you like what might happen if your opponent prevents you from playing the egg egg none of my opponents I think moving forward will have an idea of what's going on hopefully I would like to get one normal egg right so my queen was hanging so I had to move it um and in general we're going to be playing on this diagonal and this pressure do I have any advantage here no am I instigating on my opponent's Knights because of the strange development that he chose yes so opponent plays A5 which means the Knight is is gonna stay there it's I'm not going to be able to get rid of it um it also means that probably he's going to try to Castle this way and uh I mean I can play Knight H3 Knight F4 I can take some space I can move my Bishop I think I also just should play fast and confidently because I have a high rating and it's you know very intimidating um I'm looking potentially to grab the bishop yeah if this I think I can give a check actually but then the bishop will go back so I don't actually know if that accomplishes anything if Knight F4 I have this check I can take and let's just stay patient why don't we what do we write just go here life is good what's the rush what's the rush all right and this is sort of what might happen if the opponent over commits with a pawn trying to get you to go here but we're gonna have two more games if you're bored of this game because it's not exactly the egg is my subscribe my my moderator decided to uh to throw a wrench in the wheels if you will we're well I I Still Believe in Us I think we're still going to get a nice a nice big uh big big egg after this all right anegor two in fact I now have an idea I'd like to go here and then after it takes I'd like to take damage the structure and then play some sort of f4 but I do have to be careful my king is in the center it's a little bit unpleasant um now my King's no longer in the center now I'm definitely going here I'd really love to grab that Bishop so my light squared Bishop is the one surviving this move had no real threat uh it's not a bad move but it doesn't actually like I would love to go A3 but I can't really do that now we take and um maybe just F4 taking a little space queen is looking good and again I'm anticipating all of this I might have to Castle too uh I might keep my king in the center because I'm feeling edgy that's a good move maybe I will not be keeping you know what king in the center I've I've played an egg now let's keep my king in the center and uh play might rotate over this way now I do have to be a little bit on it like a tiny bit on edge not a crazy amount on edge because that pawn is hanging uh but maybe maybe it's not not the biggest deal maybe Knight B5 maybe I'll play B3 I have to be careful might not just a little bit a little bit uneasy here Let's Play Bishop F3 defend my queen looking for Rook H1 and then we can always get our Our Queen in there as well in a move or two this is a the well positioned Knight Pawn to D4 okay that's a it's definitely a good move I mean I think it's a good move I don't actually know if it's a good move um if I take the queen can come in I think I'll take I don't think I'm that scared I don't know what opponent thinking about okay that was disturbing F5 trade the Queens Maybe Bishop E3 looks I do like this move The Bishop's looking nice and nice and sturdy here on the diags Knight B5 could be next if the queen goes back to a square that's exploitable that score is definitely exploitable now I'm not now I'm getting a little bit of steam a little bit of momentum I'd love to go here but then this so I might bring my rug might also go here uh let's see let's see let's see now the egg power is showing the diagonals are looking good C3 kick out the bishop Bishop here I just pushed take as much space as I can yeah I'm I'm liking this I'm picking up a little bit of steam now D4 shutting down E5 looking good nice and nice nice big clamp we blocked our Bishop but it's okay because we needed to defend our center now I can grab the bishop I can get the bishop pair which I do like uh maybe B3 but then the Knight is coming to D5 like it's it's never it's never quite finished you know it's never quite finished I'd like to play B4 the light is coming to D5 and it's just not just gonna go here I'm gonna let him do this it's very scary but it might be worth it in the end he's thinking it's a good sign ah that that could be huge for me but there is Knight C4 which I really underestimated actually oh my goodness that's very scary looking okay luckily Knight D5 played still not I mean not finished by any stretch I'm gonna take because I think the queen end game is actually better for me I'm gonna play Rook F1 targeting this Pawn push my opponent back and now we just have to win a good old-fashioned end game unfortunately that is how a lot of chess games finish you have to actually play chess and uh the egg is no different it's a very fun opening and I and I obviously have a lot of space and my position is looking very comfortable but um I still have to win the game I'm gonna accidentally blunder this pawn and then oh I don't have Rook C1 wait I do have Rook C1 because after check I have this and when he takes my Bishop it's very nice very nice we're picking this up and we will get the job done took a little while 1800 was tough but okay well The Rook end game is certainly I mean the bishop end game is certainly winning for me I want to take take that take that and uh not let the king get close King F5 and my opponent will play until Checkmate because you never know I mean I'm a good player but even I'm capable of blundering a stalemate that but but now any move there we go okay that was a fun game um this is again the worst thing that they can play like Queen's pawn and Knight to stop you from playing the true egg um I was really hoping my opponent after H3 would just let me do it and just go here so it's the EG HG but unfortunately it was uh it was not meant to be and and I had to do it the way I did it but now hopefully we get we get a real egg uh we are going to play now with 12.50 and then we are going to play a and again Knight and Bishop could be a thing there it is but if they let you play like this this is what I'm looking for e g g I hope one of these people lets me play a normal egg you know with white you're supposed to just be able to play an egg you're not really supposed to have to uh you know beg for it but this is what it would look like now we're taking a look at where the opponent is going to Castle we can develop our pieces like this opponent has castled short um one of the nice ways to fight here is to put the knight in front of the bishop and then play G4 and H5 now to fully finish this I I might need to play this WOW A4 okay that's a peculiar move um I guess I can I can just develop I can also Castle let's just Castle let's not play in any wild way our Bishop is always going to be good this is very much instigating but I have my own pawns dude and this is the benefit of having played the egg I gained a little bit of space on that side of the board already so my pawn attack is actually quite a bit faster now you could Castle the opposite way but there was no point because my opponent already started hostilities here um Pawn to G4 looks good I like this move send the Knight back send the bishop back and just walk straight into the position Pawn takes is actually a good sneaky in between move but I just take and then maybe F4 first was a bit more accurate but see now I guess there is this move actually that could be a bit of an issue boy I'm not playing that great today I should have been a bit more patient okay my opponents are are not are not punishing me and uh they definitely could have that that last move was was not the most accurate but now we have this and you see what what what what the egg can turn into the turbocharged egg and if Pawn to G3 I'm I'm not taking I'm I'm getting in closer here and I gotta tell you this looks really unpleasant for white I mean F3 is like almost mate if you take I've got Knight H4 if you take I'm going Knight H4 Knight F3 maybe I also can take this let's just not forget the very powerful Bishop that gets developed with the egg uh can really cause some problems there and now I could have taken I could have taken to try to open this but I didn't like the fact that if I took then my queen would be locked we might trade Rooks so I decided to keep it a bit more closed um wow F3 first of all my knight is hanging right so that that's what that move does I have to be a bit careful it's a good move clever move um F3 is not a mate it it's a good move but it it's not delivering a Checkmate unfortunately so I probably should reroute my knight this looks like a good idea or come back or sack my Rook for absolutely no reason because I'm I'm trying to win this game in a in a highlight reel way um but that's that's just not that's not a good move if you have to go back E5 is a great counter move I have to think about it maybe I take take I can take but then we're gonna trade which is something that I didn't really want um I really don't want to leave the position do I have to leave the position can I sack my knight I sacrifice my Rook uh it's it's it's not it's not a move that I'd really like to make so I'm gonna come back let's see if my opponent finds Queen C2 which is another really really smart follow-up um which would Target my my knight on G6 okay opponent takes first I'm not a huge fan of that I kind of liked the pawn was blocking a lot of my movement but to each their own Queen C2 I might have to throw in this move and also now I can play Rook F6 which was a move that I couldn't really play on the last move uh with the pawn gone I can play that move I've been thinking about this but I but I thought this just facilitates what I want right like I've been talking about getting this Pawn to ah it's just game over I just go back oh my opponents succumbed to the pressure E5 was a great move but then unfortunately they followed it up with a catastrophic plan that night was an anchor that night was stopping G2 mate for now uh but now this is just game over because Queen H3 is coming and I mean my opponent has to move the king and play Rook G1 that's the only thing they can do they have to move the Rook and then try to protect against this because there's no way to stop that and in the meantime I'm going to take this which is uh which is a fatal loss of material unfortunately yep Queen H3 and that's just game over that is just a forced Checkmate I don't even need to sack my Rook so this is how the egg attacks all right um I could have done it in a more controlled way and we are going to analyze that I sometimes I you know again I'm playing lower rated subscribers and I'm I'm thinking okay I'm just gonna it's gonna be a little bit easy I'm not taking their rating maybe as seriously as I should and then they find exceptional moves this is just a sacrifice to try to give me another check I didn't have to take I could have played King h8 but you never know when you'll need an insurance policy and that made us Unstoppable but you shouldn't pre-move it because Queen F3 is the last thing that might this is a safe pre-move because you know taking your own Pawn is not actually possible um and that's game over I mean there's just nothing here that plan of moving the Knight into the game was bad uh and we are going to analyze I'll just play Rook F5 and I told you I don't pre-move made now you can pre-move it all right so a couple of moves ago like this movie five was just a fantastic counter counter punch and and I had to leave the territory and if my opponent had played it a bit more accurately life would have been good for them um of course the computer always likes the I mean it it's going to give the egg an advantage right like it's it's not it's it's like a 0.8 opening for white it's just always better for white but by the middle game and me playing F5 I actually completely reasonably got back into the game and I got a position where I was better I should have been more patient here I should have defended my Pawn like this and kept the center locked a closed center benefits the attacking side actually we saw in this game what happens when the center isn't closed this is possible this is actually a perfect example of why you need to close the center before you attack somebody all right um I didn't and in this game my opponent made a very quick uh counter play measure but then after that this was incorrect and this was even worse and then here if my opponent had gone back to E1 I'm not much better but my plan is the same Knight C6 get in here and a permanent attack is brewing where it's very difficult for my opponent to move so we actually saw in this game um how the egg which normally is egg got a position like this and wasn't even that bad I mean I finish my development and then I created a same side pawn attack and like I gotta tell you I I was equal right I mean you you can play like this yes I'm a higher rated player playing against subscribers but I didn't do anything insanely out of the ordinary and my opponent found a really nice countermeasure so I I like this I mean the way the way we got this position same side big attack looking really really nice and obviously opponent fought back I should have taken them a little bit more more seriously defensively but E5 was a phenomenal move um that caused me some serious problems all right next game is against Atomic banana now again you can start with E you can also start with GG um hopefully they don't okay with white you are more or less guaranteed to get an egg unless again they play H5 which is like if all of these subscribers act up like this that would be very annoying um you can play H3 right you can prepare it but now we have actually played our very first official egg of the of the day e g g we've played an egg all right and now we're gonna try to play this in a in a similar style uh to uh to the other games we're putting our Bishop here it's like a it's a little bit like a grab but it's you know not exactly the grub E4 allows us to have a Target very early I'm not a huge fan of E4 because black has already moved that pawn and it was really comfortable where it was here it might just help us like it's just going to help us get developed um if Queen takes there is this so I might take with the pawn although I again I I just don't want to go for a queenless position so I'm going to do this if Knight F6 I can even already begin playing G5 so I don't even need to keep my Pawn passive on G4 um I can keep it a bit more active on the uh on the G you know on the G5 square and then like this so okay this person is just trying to trade off a bunch of pieces I don't want to allow this and I don't want to get rid of my knight um I thought about putting my knight in front of my queen but I don't really see why I would do that so we can we can add another element of of the egg now which is um potentially some some Queen pins and and all of this stuff um or I can make a big Center maybe a big Center egg blocking my Bishop but huge Center and then maybe F4 as well and maybe all of this so slightly different than the last game we have a lock Center this time maybe H3 and then F4 to just get all the the EFG pawns rolling in that's the way we're gonna do it this time um obviously something might come to B4 so A3 is always good A3 B4 always good now uh I can go for the Giga egg might as well play like this maybe F4 there's Queen H4 check so yeah this is very risky and completely unnecessary and I could have just finished my development with like Knight D2 or A3 B4 Knight T2 uh or Bishop F4 and then something like this but I gotta go for the Giga egg right this is all my pawns going together Center is locked and and I'm you know it's stupid looking but it's actually not that bad like we saw in the last game stockfish gives it a slightly worse evaluation but it's nothing drastic all right Queen D7 trying to win my egg Pawn um I can Uno reverse it on my opponent that might be kind of funny um I have a feeling my opponent's gonna go for a queen trade Maybe but I can just kick my opponent out okay here come all my pawns so there's the big Center uh if Queen G4 I might not have a choice I might actually have to trade Queens which is all right no problem we'll we'll play a queenless game now very important you don't allow anything here so A3 comfortable move stopping anything from going to B4 and uh A5 is played that's not an unreasonable response and maybe I'll play like Knight D2 and and then B3 or or maybe just B3 um let's go here I also don't know where my opponent is going to commit the king also my opponent is uh probably like 1500 rapid because they're playing very very well I can trade Bishops so I can bring my king forward and trade Bishops the other way I can trade Bishops this way I can also play Knight B3 and not trade Bishops but if I play Knight B3 where's my not going after that right that's how we have to think about things um let's play Bishop F3 I'm gonna offer get this developed and then I will make my next decision after that so this time we're not getting a big same side attack although although we could like that's still a thing it's it's just okay opposite side castling We're not gonna get that um I can still play a move like F5 and and and you know have a lot of space but this is looking much more like an end game so we gotta get our King involved and we've got to finish our development we've got to find where we're putting our Rooks so this is an egg end game right F5 is a is a good move trying to Win Some central space Maybe which is exactly why I thought that I you know I should play F5 um I can't play B4 so let's play B3 Bishop B2 ig6 is also a really tough move I should have played H5 okay maybe I'm gonna I wanted to go here but then D3 so I'm gonna go here and hit the bishop but yeah even even my 900 rated opponent is fighting back today the subscribers today came to fight I mean really really came to fight which I which I like I I appreciate that very much um I can take but then the Rook is active so maybe we we do this this is this is tricky stuff we're opening up our Rook and potentially deflecting one of these pieces off the D4 square but I think a move like Knight D5 is is totally reasonable um it's a it's a Gambit like I'm I'm gambling in the end game to try to open up the b and a lines and it's again okay my opponent respected me so now I can play B5 which I think was a little bit passive but again that was sort of the idea hopefully get them a little bit on edge and now I have the a file so I have the a file to work with it was a bit of a bluff and I feel like stockfish would have called it but luckily I'm well I don't know if I'm playing stockfish but I don't think I am Knight D4 uh there is a tactic here which is this this and then Rook D4 but I think yeah I think I have B6 and I also have this I don't know which one of them is better but this looks quite vicious this looks quite vicious now utilizing the bishop and the pin and this is how the egg attacks on opposite sides all right in the first game we had a we had a pretty imbalanced egg a weird egg this time we have opposite side castling egg Knight D5 but that hits this but unfortunately this is a check so I win material beef oh that's that's not they should have went in front of me now I can just pick up material hit a couple of these they gotta go back yeah chess is hard yeah unfortunately unfortunately we're gonna we're gonna deliver the goodies here I think Queen C5 was Queen C5 was made in one there we go all right let's analyze that was a fun one thank you for the game um again G4 clearly not a good move it's going to be slightly worse according to stockfish however E4 gives some good chances back to me uh and D4 is already allowing me to to consolidate how I want like the computer likes this setup a lot it likes H3 if this even F takes is fine but Bishop takes is also good and we saw these Bishops in game one come alive and then Knight here and night and uh bring my Rook out and everything I did it this way and I tried to create the Giga egg even this according to stockfish is not even that bad Queen D7 G5 and and in this position um F4 was too much I mean F4 was just was just a little bit too aggressive uh I I obviously should have focused more on on development but I decided to show like how you can play this is a great move and a really annoying move because I didn't want to allow the queen to just be here it's a huge pain it's very annoying to deal with I can't get rid of it maybe I would have had to play like F5 to try to trap the queen but um yeah it's a bit a bit a bit silly um so I traded and I did it this way and my opponent played very well I mean I equalized you know I I got a decent position of course here I should play F5 um but they played out five themselves which was a fantastic move F5 severely restricts the Knight and if something like this you know I'm more than happy applying pressure for the rest of the game and this is again we saw in the last game how my massive Pawn cluster moved forward in the egg when your pawns get rolling like this you actually can get some very serious positions so um this was a real egg this was egg there was no h in the middle to prepare it but the H Pawn is super useful in a lot of these positions as we've seen either to play a bit more passively and just have a very strong Bishop uh or uh like the way it did in this game which was helping me expand with all of my pawns to try to create an attack now uh is this like good chess and will the egg get played at the world championship or the candidates tournaments or anything like that no uh at the high level this opening allows a very quick advantage to the opponent but the problem is for 99 of chess players they don't exploit this opening in the right way even people at my level I've played Blitz Games Against 2700s they very frequently do dumb things and they do not exploit this opening in the right way and if you just play a couple of natural looking moves like Knight F6 for example um after something like G5 white just gets a very comfortable position and is no longer worse and it's just an exotic and slightly different way to play chess so my friends I'd like to introduce you to the egg that is literally it uh sometimes you need to play H3 to enable it or else you're going to lose the pawn get your Bishop on this diagonal and do your best sometimes you attack with the bishop on the queen side sometimes you create huge same side attacking possibilities as we saw sometimes it's opposite side castling and there's all sorts of weird Dynamics where you can create attacks sometimes your king stays in the center sometimes it castles even into the expanded Pawns but in short that's the egg now get out of here
