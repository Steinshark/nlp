so I've never had this happen during a article read I had one strong opinion at the beginning of the experience and I ended completely different this is a wild ride what goes on with reddis all right I know I'm a little late to the party but apparently reddis has adopted some dual Source available licensing thing okay so I I I actually haven't watched any of this but or I haven't read on anything and we haven't watched any videos we do have potentially a video somewhere on here yeah the downfall of reddis man it sounds we have the the the pr that it happened with and we have a specific comment that apparently is pretty intense about it all but we will start right here with the actual release and then we're going to go uh forward maybe we'll look at the video maybe we're going to look at the GitHub issue maybe we'll do all of them okay let's just hey let's just run the let let's hey calm down okay I see people being like you didn't even watch the video the video does it let's let's let's get the whole thing let's get the whole thing in okay calm down future reddis releases will continue to offer free and permissive use for uh of the source code under dual rsv2 and SSP lv1 licenses so I actually don't I've never even heard of these licenses I mean this one sounds like an encryption algorithm this thing sounds like something my wife has a a subscription to I don't know what this I what is this uh these releases will combine Advanced Data types and processing engines previously only available in the Reda stack I don't even know what are we trying to say okay anyway so things happen beginning today all Futures uh future versions of reddis will be released with Source available licenses starting with reddis 7.4 reddis will be dual licensed under the reddis source available license and the server side public license consequently reddis will no longer be distributed under the three claw Berkeley software distribution BSD from day one redus has provided a foundation of performance and simplicity for the applications and data infrastructure that power the modern inter uh internet now 15 years later we're proud to serve millions of Developers across the globe by supporting real-time applications the world depends on every day we have already implemented dual licensing for our Advanced redus modules under the Reda stack distribution which have has been well received by the community is this by the way I is this is this is this the truth are people happy in the advanced reddis modules that they got this new licensing uh in fact more than 50% of redis IO downloads from redis 6 and Beyond come from redis stack we now believe that extending this licensing to Reus itself will enable us to continue to evolve the most holistic set of data models processing engines and develop and developer capabilities for our users all right so I guess I have a question right away with what they're saying is what they're saying this hey we've been developing this product for 15 years and we've been unable to effectively monetize this well cuz to me I assume this licensing is for some sort of monetization and we're looking for a new way to monetize and thus we're not even talking about like our our Advanced modules we're talking about RIT s we want to be able to move it into such a place that commercially using redus will cost you money yes they need money because they can't maintain the product anymore that's I mean that's fair uh is this another rug pole and software it's I mean 15 years is entirely too long of a long con that's a long okay can we all agree that this is a long con right here so no my guess is this is not a rug pole my guess is that um that's exactly how Boomers operate they think ahead for decades um they weren't even Boomers back then okay they weren't even Boomers okay they the term didn't even exist when they did it it's to extract money from Amazon if I don't know if Netflix uses reddis or some version of redis I'm sure they do I think every big company uses reddis pretty much and so my ass my assumption is that the point is to be able to extract money out of larger um larger corporations correct redus is effectively everywhere and so by doing that that's that's that's my assumption behind this uh goorse reddish yeah uh rent seeking Behavior well it's not rent seeking Behavior so let's just pretend that what I've said so far is absolutely and perfectly correct it is this is the same argument that we all recognize and have said about open source which is open source is largely a thankless job in which people will not support it right do you think that they would have done this if everybody who used it commercially all the companies who used it all the individuals who used it and had their problem solved they all sent them some amount of cash proportionate P based on their usage and usefulness do you think this would have happened my guess is probably not but maybe still it would have happened in that you know in in an effort to kind of grab B any money you can but it's truly the problem of Open Source is that whatever you have a good product that everybody uses nobody appreciates it and when nobody appreciates it it just leads to some like especially something like reddis where they need to have money to develop it you know I'm not saying what they're doing is good behavior I'm not I'm not even trying to ad justify their good behavior I'm just trying to rationalize why this Behavior exists do I think it's good I I mean the hard part is you built it open for people to use you got a bunch of people and companies to use it and now you're changing it I can see why people would feel like this is a rug pull I can see why people would feel this is really bad right the new source available licenses allow us to sustainably provide per uh permissive use of our source code we're leading reddis into its next phase of development as a realtime data platform with a unified set of clients tools and core reddis product offerings the reddis source code yes okay there you go reddis product offerings how they make money right it stinks but it's not morally wrong or anything yeah I it's hard for me to justif like it's hard for for me to say what they're doing is well yeah it's hard I'd say that this is an extremely I it's not see okay I know you're probably just trying to get me to get all upset but this really isn't cap don't stop it with the capitalism this is not a capitalism problem right this is the fact that people have been working on a product for free for what appears to be a decade and a half right I'm sure there I'm AOL take this is such an AOL take it's greed isn't it you know it's this really is the shambles I mean if you look at the X XZ exploit it's because one person was exploited for their work got burnt out got pressured into giving up full and unified control and Gan gave us the biggest backdoor Wing we've ever received in our lifetime luckily that backdoor wiang got caught by the way if you don't know the back door Wing reference that is a sand bakman freed reference it it sounds like how it sounds okay so just just deal with it um anyways uh so you you get the idea like you get the idea the the Redd uh the redus source code will continue to be freely available to developers customers and partners through the reddis Community Edition they're still offering reddis Community Edition is that for free uh future reddis Source available versions will unify uh core redus with reddis stack so Reedus stack must be because they're doing capital S on this one this must be like their commercial product including search jesson vector probabilistic and time Seri data models in one free easy to ous package as now downloadable software this will allow anyone to easily use Reedus across a variety of contexts including a as high performance key value and document store a powerful query engine in a low latency Vector database powering generative AI applications damn damn even got even snuck AI in there primon we've seen it so many times and we'll see it again but you either change the license and make money or you stop developing I think this is a I think this is a fair statement right which is that I I don't think it's unreasonable to say that people shouldn't be forced to cre create and maintain free products that you use right because that's kind of the inverse of this and that's where this moral gray ground is for me because I I can't I can't justify I I don't know how to justify it 10 Amazon did it doesn't it it doesn't matter yeah they they helped I get it they helped but that doesn't justify it like right you're justifying the fact that you think it should be something different it's not your product it's not your cha choice to make is it shitty that they did this yes I don't think it's great where a bunch of these people now feel like they have to choose a forked version of redis or not and guess what's going to happen you know the community Fork that's going to come out for uh redis it's going to have the same problem do you think that just by forking it and a bunch of highly motivated individuals won't eventually fall into the same problem Amazon already backed this Fork so okay so Amazon's already backed the fork of I wonder I wonder what what it means for Amazon to do this really obviously Amazon did this because it's it's it's probably very very valuable it probably would cost them so much dang money that they uh that they didn't that they made this choice right which is they can pay significantly less money by supporting a fork which I mean can we all take a step for just a second and realize also the shittiness of that right can we can we minimally understand the kind of shittiness of that right that Amazon is using something and they're able to effectively pay less by supporting someone to Fork it and move forward with their support right I mean I'm not like I don't think any of it is like there's not like some sort of moral High Ground I I I don't think there's a moral High Ground argument here why wouldn't they do that no I agree it's it's it's it it makes sense that they did it because monetarily it probably it probably you know it probably makes more sense yeah it might as well support the original uh the original creators yeah I mean there's a whole problem here you know this is the problem I have with these kind of these kind of changes is that you'll see people that get pissed off like about AI generating art that's in the style of somebody else or generating art that's been trained off of all these things and like you why W you just support the original creators and then you have things like this where it is a similares vein where the original creators despite them not I would I'm still on your team I don't think it's good I think what they're doing is not great but at the same time can you not see how you're not supporting the original creators here you just a lot of people did a lot of free work the hard part is free and open source software is is is genuinely a lie it's effectively impossible a few companies will do it but most will never ever ever be able to do it or sustain it reasonably for a long time they're they're not actually the original creators they're probably I'm sure there might be original Creator somewhere on reeda still probably there except Linux yeah Linux is that's why I said there probably is something there uh certainly today we've encountered uh peculiar issues because of capitalism yet Alternatives prove more detrimental when open source projects becomes monetize it's uh it's for specific reasons either greed or necessity it's important not to overlook the fact that many companies also benefit from this period it's true many companies benefit from it I don't know I I have a really hard time siding with either side in this one uh llmt he used certainly fact uh the success of redis has created a unique set of challenges redis has been sponsoring the bulk of development alongside a dynamic community of developers eager to contribute however the majority of Reedus's commercial sales are channeled through the large largest cloud service providers who commoditize arus Investments and its open source Community I wonder I wonder what company they're talking about what company could be com uh commercializing Reddit or redis like this I mean it feels bad I mean maybe redis should have done this for themselves but despite uh efforts to support a community-led governance model our desire to maintain the BS SD license uh delivering multitude of software distribution simultaneously across open source source available and Commercial software optimized for different on premise and Cloud platforms is that odds with our ability to drive reddis successfully into the future under the new license cloud service providers hosting reddis offerings will no longer be permitted to use uh the source code of redus free of charge for example cloud service providers will be able to deliver reddis 7.4 only after agreeing to licensing terms with redis the maintainers of redis code these agreements will underpin support for existing Integrated Solutions and provide full access to forthcoming redus Innovations so one problem I have with people getting up in arms about this is the amount of people always yelling about companies needing to pay their fair share when it comes to open source okay I know but look at what it said it said if a company uses this if cloud service providers uses it then they have to agree to these terms I don't does this does this account for for individuals that's that's what I'm missing here because if individually then and developers don't have to pay anything that are just using it for themselves I don't see why people are as much up in arms about it they're reselling it yeah they're reselling it right am I completely off base here individuals are not cloud service providers right one would assume am I like real talk am I completely off base in this thinking because I I'm trying to like I'm trying to I'm trying to rationalize why people constantly say how commercials needs to support open source software open source software makes license change to force commercials to support them people say you're a jerk for doing it I'm trying I'm like I'm trying to figure out where where the problem is yeah older versions are still under there L take for lovely take people just like the [ __ ] and moan uh I read it as no change for developers if if you're just a developer using it individually then that's I guess that's the real question I want to know if if that happens so uh instead of continuing on down this route let's because it doesn't look like this is all just like in practice nothing changes for red reddest developer Community who will continue to enjoy permissive licensing under dual license okay so the community reddis developer community so at the same time all reddis client libraries under the responsibility of reddis will remain open source licensed redis will continue to support the vast partner ecosystem so is that saying what I think it is is that yeah uh rdus will continue to support its vast partner ecosystem including managed service providers and system integrators with exclusive access to all future release updates uh releases updates and feature development are developed and delivered by reddis through partner program hey man there's a bunch of useful information on this page but I think you should just sign up okayy do you want to sign up hey you want to fill in this form hey this form's right here for you to fill in just why don't you hey why don't you fill it in I was just wondering what the partner program is uh welcome to the reddest partner program when Innovation meets collaboration would you have like an llm try to be a LinkedIn [ __ ] poster and businesses thrive on the foundation of speed performance and flexibility Enterprise matters and redis partners understand your business needs inside and out they deliver tailored Solutions ensuring you get the most out of reddest and best-in-class Technology stack scale smarter and faster with the support of our Global Partners find a partner I know there's a lot of arch users that could use this button in their life that might have been the harshest thing said on this stream uh anyways all right so let's let's let's let's let's let's watch this video because now okay so now we're all on this page as far as I can tell there's no change to the individual developer hosting their own Reddit for their own site doing something there's only changes to commercial we get it now and people are up in arms saying reddis is crazy man I hate to I I feel like I'm why do how do I feel like the bad guy for saying this feels really hypocritical of most people that complain about open source what if I told you that redis was not actually created by reddis if you are confused right now you are in for a ride R okay so maybe there's something more that I don't understand here that actually makes this more interesting okay so so we got to let this guy cook so this this this does show that maybe maybe we we we got something okay okay okay I could be wrong it ended in the very recent events of red is changing their license to actually not be open source anymore and scamming their Community contribut this and even the founder of reddis himself it all started in 2007 when Salvador San filipo better known as Entz on the internet was building a tool called LL o g it was a very early competitor to is he competing with Minecraft Google analytics the main selling point of L was their realtime visitor tracking feature which Google analytics did not support until years later because of the massive amounts of data written to the database they ran into performance issues using MySQL antias believed that using memory instead of the hard drive to store the data like masel does would solve the problem and yo dummy why don't you just use the memory instead of the disc of course of course it's faster duh you dummy what do you think dummy what if we lose power program the first prototype of what we will later know as redis in 2009 antiz published a redis core on GitHub to say it with his own words at this point the server may not have been perfectly stable but soon it will be an essential part of many web applications and massively impact how we design modern software architecture that is really great foresight I didn't realize how I didn't realize the origin I didn't know the origin story to Reis so that's that's pretty impressive that that he was able to say like yeah this is going to become increasingly important that is one big Arrow by the way this is a statistically non- average arrow for those that are wondering to this day the first hecka news posting of reddis did not get much attention at all only 23 uploads and a few comments but anti continued to work on reddis and soon reddis started to spread in the Ruby community and attracted startups will later turn out to be unicorns Instagram was entirely built on reddis in its early years get wasn't early reddis just like just purely an in inmemory key value story so so how did they have any was there no historical I I didn't use Instagram in the beginnings so does that mean there was no like historical data to Instagram like every time it went down it was just like everybody starting over everyone sign up with the new account Instagram just didn't have a database oh S3 buckets okay it just Jam a bunch of stuff into S3 buckets reddis does write to dis okay so it does Peri periodically our sync okay it's eventually consistent so you may lose a little bit okay I thought back then redus was purely just an in-memory one okay I didn't realize that it it it also synced with disc and had like a refresh State okay yeah that's cool yeah I don't see why you couldn't do that let's go talk about talk talk about some Scrappy cating what was it what was it $32 per us user that Instagram sold for I can't remember how much Instagram sold for but it sold for just an incredible amount of money per user ithub used it to build a chop queuing system and Twitter improved their timeline page performance using redis after gaining more popularity VMware started to sponsor and hired anti to continue his work on the inmemory database oh in 2013 he got sponsored by the VMware spinoff pivotal soft ware in the same time period around 2011 companies started to offer consulting services for redis oh there's a second big Arrow here okay we have conflicting arrows one of them was guarante a data which will play an essential role in this entire story in 2014 guarante a data tried to Rebrand to Red is DB but after the push back of an they reverted the rebranding and rebranded to Red is Labs instead which is still very confusing around this time Redd Labs also transitioned away from offering consulting services and focused on providing hosted red services on top of AWS instead in 2015 a common investor of pivotal software and reddis Labs suggested moving anes to redis Labs which employed him shortly after that and sponsored reddis from this point on investors play a crucial role in reddest Labs because that company is stacked stacked up with VC money they ra they raised 347 million us damn that screen tearing hey the screen tearing is for free for you bed over $347 million Us in seven rounds from Goldman Sach the Silicon Valley Bank and Silicon Valley Bank mentioned let's go let's go more to set this into perspective if we wanted to just fund the open source project with let's say five developers each a salary of $400,000 a year this would come to $26 million over the span of 13 years less than a tenth of the funding of red is lab okay so I think I'm starting to understand why this license change was as bad I I I did not know about a lot of these uh I didn't know about some of these changes which makes that things seem uh a little bit different right there's some change here so you know maybe I am the [ __ ] maybe I am truly the [ __ ] here after anti transferred over the Red's IP and trademarks to redis Labs he left the project in 2020 in the block post he explained the reasons for stepping back he never wanted to be a softer maintainer and used code to express himself but what G it Chad who who wants who wants to who wants to maintain that code who wants to maintain that one I just want to I just want to express myself in code I just want to say how I feel with my code dude G dude chat chatted anti res is the real deal yeah yeah well I mean he did predict how useful Reddit would be and created Reddit and did it so yeah you you can't dunk on the guy for not actually he expresses himself very well in code one quote Reddit sorry Reddit did I say Reddit side of his goodbye blog post hits quite a lot harder today I believe I'm not just leaving Redd is in the hands of a community of expert programmers but also in the hands of people who care about the legacy of the community spirit of redis in there goodbye Block it's kind of funny you know you know this is sometimes where politeness is kind of goofy I'm leaving this in the hands of the people who care the most and they kind of you know I it kind of feels like he got Bamboozled you know I'm not going to I'm not going to lie to you there kind of there's kind of a bit of like bamboozling going on here red is lab stated that the core of the reddest project will remain under the three class BSD license as it has always been but this will only hold true for a few more years red is was now led by a team of five people three of them are from redest Labs one of them from I can see why they needed to I I see why they needed $340 million from Alibaba and one from AWS one year later red is Labs officially rended to just redis is what they wanted all along redis the company was still developing hosted redis services on top of popular Cloud providers essentially dude this back door this was a bigger back door than XZ like real talk this this was the this was the this was I mean this was the long Pole right here this is an actual rug pole competing with AWS elastic cash and we'll find out soon that they were probably not very successful in doing so or at least not successful enough while the Redd is core team remains small red is the company oh red core team remains small 700 employees okay you know this could be me being ignorant hey I could be ignorant I could hey real talk I could be ignorant but that just seems like a lot 650 scrub Masters lots of lots of scrub mastering 700 is small yeah but okay 300 of them are salese what are the other 400 how many people it seems like it's it's you know again this could just be ignorant speaking you know sometimes you think you you're like it shouldn't be that big but then you realize like okay that's why it's that big but has gone to over 700 employees today I could not even make upes for all of those people if I wanted to but browsing through the Wayback machine snapshots of the reddest website makes me think quite a few of them were busy updating the web design a concerning amount of time and on March the 20th 2024 the day arrived where VC money defeated open source in the company R is announced in a block post that they will move away from the three class BSD license to a dual licensing model which basically means that they offer it under two different licenses and you can choose which is the Lesser evil while the three class BSD license is one of the approved ones by the open source initiative the new licenses are not which they acknowledged in the announcement therefore red is will no longer be called Open Source before I continue by The OSI definition so that means yeah because they're referring to themselves as Source available meaning that you can look at the source but it also means that you can Fork The Source can you Fork The Source if you Fork The Source you can't change the license right so you can only fork The Source starting from 7.4 not anymore you can't even look at you can't even look at it Fork The Source change the license can you do that you can Fork source and profit and profit from it I don't think you can do that it's just text I don't think that that's how it works I I'm I'm try to stop I don't need to try to stop you but you know that lawyer that's going to just take you to pound me in the ass prison they're going to be the ones that stop you I'm just saying it's a little it's a it's a little it's a little bit difficult to be like it's just it's just some text I just did a f and replace I don't know uh valky already forked it yeah but they must have forked it at 7.4 right they forked it under the BSD license thus it's legal to Fork it at that point now you can do it office space mentioned that is office space mentioned social credit score minus 100 yeah yes correct they they forked it at at a time in which was allowed to okay I have to say I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice in any way the new licenses are called side public license and red Source available license 2.0 the sspl was originally created for mongodb and requires everyone who uses sspl license software as part of a service to release the source for the entirety of the service in hold on with a modified 13 that requires making SSL license software available to third parties modified or not as part of a service must release the source for the entirety of the service so mongod DB had this as a li did did people that used mongod like oh is that mean if you use the source code that's different that's different than it's different than than using the product versus using the source code right but I guess how do you use the how do you use the product without a bit of the source code on there right it's kind of hard right because you you kind of need like the the the thing that communicates to to the item which is probably a part of this viral licensing I've heard about the I've heard about these viral licensing that are very um very uh very dangerous yikes including with imitations all management software user interfaces application program interfaces automation software monitoring software backup software storage software and hosting software all such that a US user can run an instance of the service using the service source code you made available well this sounds like a nightmare especially if you have some sort of proprietary license software in your stack that you simply cannot open source for legal reasons after the sspl was submitted to the open- source initiative as they wanted to become an approved open- Source license the open source initiative made a hit piece calling it a fox pen Source license because it restricts who can use L it yeah that's that's rather wild this is a hit piece dude that you know the this is the part of software that like I just I literally have no idea about it's it's supposed to be faxen right F A ux is Fox um but you know what's kind of wild is that I wonder if you could I wonder if you could make like a viral hit in node with you know because you know how many npm packages there are there's like literally a kajillion npm packages I wonder if you could just how could you do that if you rebase and throw in something in the past is that and you made it like a or you didn't have to throw in the P you just threw it in there and you threw it as like 1.01 so it automatically gets updated in people's code and then they use it and if they use it they have to open source it it's kind of wild like is even s SPL dude I know how F would that be it need to be fair what needs to be fair this isn't a real Tech and no one is really enforcing it well I mean what happened if you could I'm just saying this stuff is super you know I knew this stuff basically existed yeah a viral license bomb dang kind of kind of wild viral license bombs version attacks like that exist I know it's kind of this is like yeah a supply chain license attack yeah know exactly I mean that's the thing is people are going to make a whole whole there's going to be a whole Cottage can there be an entire cottage industry of people making somehow money lawyering off of these type of license changes I don't know it's kind of wild the other license in question is the reddest Source available license 2.0 this license does not require you to publish the source code but it restricts who can use it directly in the license terms it says you may not make the functionality of the software or a modified version available to third parties as a service or distribute the version or a modified version in a manner that makes the functionality of the software available to third parties now again I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice but this sounds like a very vague definition to me and you may not make functionality of the software or a modified version available to third parties as a service or distribute the software or modified version in a manner that makes the functionality of the software available to third parties it is vague so how did they Fork it they forked it at 7.4 or whatever whatever was the last one it is extremely vague right I I can I I can understand why people are saying this is is extremely vague right me putting on my various lawyerings hat and my bird law hat meaning I'm not a lawyer but just me trying to logically argue out exactly what this means I cannot come up with an exact thing right meaning that let's see or distribute software or a modified version in a manner that makes functionality of the software available to third parties what does that mean like does that mean if somebody in a third party logs in and the logs in the logging in uses reddis that's like making functionality available to a third party which means have we just hit have we just hit ourselves into a problem this feels like bird law okay again my various lawyer Rings yeah there so that's the people are saying that's the point that they uh that the let's see their lawyers want it to be as vague so they could Define how they want it in court yeah I mean that is part of the problem with this I think that I think it's also hard to make it stand up in court because whenever you do something I mean the problem is when something is so so vague it's very hard to make it also stand up in court but yeah but the judge gets to decide yeah that's that's the that's that's the hard part um yeah I wouldn't I I would probably I would probably not uh I would probably not touch this with a with a 10ft pull right like this sounds wildly even though it's only $5 a month or distributed version or a modified version in a manner that makes the functionality of the software available to third parties now again I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice but this sounds like a very vague definition to me yeah it is very and when we look at the fqs for redis modules which were already relicensed to the same licenses before they State multiple times that the change should not affect you but if not even reders themselves can tell me with certainty who can no matter where exactly the limits are it is very clear that under none of the new licenses Cloud providers like AWS will be able to provide HED reded services without paying a fee which I mean again I think that we can all agree that that's probably in some sense fine right I don't know is that fine man I have such a hard time going back and forth on this one but I mean AWS now forked it and now that they forked it at 7.4 or whatever it is it's just like that's valky is already out there I know everyone's okay with AWS the L right you should never you should never make a rule in your head because you know that one big company can get screwed right like a a generally good rule of thumb is you should try to think through a problem and what its implications are not that we all can't agree that like yo yeah yeah make Amazon pay right like sure but you got to think through the problems and what does it actually mean to the people that aren't Amazon cuz once you do once you do it with the big company it keeps on on goinging right it doesn't stop at Amazon Amazon's just the first it Amazon's the precedent that wins all the future cases right and that's where things kind of get in the murky Waters and so so Amazon isn't going to eat that price yeah I don't think they will that's why it is a problem that's why this is a problem [ __ ] flows Downstream yeah yeah which was obviously the goal but it is also important to note something else if redis would have had this license from the very beginning guarante a data would have never been able to offer the services in the first place without open sourcing their entire infrastructure they destroyed the very thing that made their company exists in the first place yeah that's a fair take okay you know what I have officially changed my stance I have I have officially changed my stance this is is a rug pull I played myself played myself like a fiddle hey I'm willing to be wrong I'm always willing to be wrong it's a scumbag move they themselves profited off of something in which they then in turned were able to capture the whole thing maybe potentially just due to how close their naming was and however the VC incest party went that caused those two people to like work together right I mean the fact that the original redis guy sold all the IP or whatever happened I mean he just wanted to cash out it sounds like he wanted to be done with this crap I don't probably blame him probably was like hugely political super super awful not something you want to be a part of not something I want to be a part of I think we can all give the original Creator uh a free pass here i' take the money too right I don't if anyone thinks they're like on this moral High Ground that they would have been like I would have stood up for truth and Justice it's like nah you wouldn't have no no you you you you wouldn't okay okay you really you really would not have stood for truth and Justice okay you know all heroes uh all heroes costumes eventually wear out yeah I'll stand for it after I get the bag I'm gonna get the bag and then I'm super angry that they did it right all right hold on someone someone just posted a a good comment here all right it's time for a solid fork with custom restrictions Banning uh reddis Labs from ever using the new code from new Forks let's starve them yeah I would actually say that you you you theoretic could do this and how you would do this is you would have to create a public Fork I mean can we be real here for a quick second Amazon Amazon is most certainly profiting the most from this okay they're the ones that are going to be able to effectively make it out like a bandit while everybody else carries the tax right they're the true winners in this situation cuz they're the ones that are going to be like oh man we're going to give you guys a 100,000 a [Applause] year hey yeah and they're going to be just like hell yeah sponsored by Amazon they're like for five years two correct we're going to make a we're going to make a billion dollars off this [ __ ] right because that's their most profitable Center is AWS they make in in just inordinate amount of money off of it sponsored by fizer and Amazon don't forget to get your new migraine medication um anyways let's see honestly I don't care if reddis would use code from the new Fork it's open source for a reason we can't become the thing we are bashing and block blocking Rus from pulling commits really defeats the purpose of original license we are all upset over them removing man this guy's we have found an honor we found an honorable individual Gilda is just like yo [ __ ] that guy principal to a fault yeah it's it's principal to a fall which I think if you the here so here's like kind of like my take on this one which is that if you really want to make sure you don't become the thing you don't like you have to even allow the thing you don't like to be able to Pro like you have to be able to even allow them to use you I I do actually agree with him if you wanted to be fully like this is the Open Source One then you'd have to make it open source for all right because once you put in restrictions the restrictions can grow and then who knows hey extreme Ownage principal stat principal stance though I can see why people would be upset about it I don't know how to thumb apparently am I not signed in I'm not even signed in what a loser new computer still okay just switch browsers okay just switch BR don't don't judge me like this here [ __ ] fire Firefox oh gosh don't get embarrassed what was his it was it it was what is it Ownage thumbs up see I dude I I I I code I'm not just an influencer guys you know what I mean I'm one of I'm one of us you know what I'm talking about Bros I'm not a Dev I'm not a devell stop I'm not a devell with the license by the way that just single-handedly just like made so many people's day worse by me just dunking on on devels like that alone just made a bunch of people's days worse and I'm sorry I'm sorry that you've chosen to be a Dev all right all right all right got him all right let's go let change the AWS employee medeline Olen who worked on the project for 4 years announced that she will no longer be able to win work on the project and that there was a real price to pay with losing such a beloved open-source project but not only some of the main contributors are unhappy with the change the pool request with the license change is flooded with un and users of reddis again this is not legal advice but redis did just relicense code that was contributed under a completely different license and they removed all bstd notices which are required by the the three Claus BSD license I cannot imagine that is what anti meant when he was talking about caring about the legacy of the community Spirit of remember when I said polite comments you know this is one of those things where you know I I talked earlier about like always being wise with your words and communicating in kind of like a polite way because you don't want to come back and haunt you but if you have like hey these people are dangerous maybe you should be willing to say that right there just throwing it out there it's definitely a balance is with the legal un people will look for Alternatives and to say honestly to be real he's probably he probably had to sign some sort of like hey you're going to sell it all these things and you get all these things but you have to leave and you have to leave and you have to say good terms and you can't say yo these people are a bunch of [ __ ] don't trust them that they will find them there is already kydb which is a drop in replacement for redis and just a few days before redis announced a license change Microsoft released garet a cashore that can be used with existing redest clients both of them are open source and it would really come as a surprise if AWS won't jump in as well and develop their own red is Fork as well as they did with open search when elastic search changed their license it is really a Nob brainer for anyone starting a new project to use any of the Alternatives and for the most part you can probably replace them in your existing project as well without any problems so when the license change man I feel I I I feel like completely Bamboozled right now I I honestly feel like I haven't had this big of an emotional swing on something in a long time I I am chook right now I am genuinely I'm I I feel Bamboozled right now which introduces so many more challenges and legal uncertainties driving away the community from reddis why on Earth would they do it it's not first off this video is extremely good but it's the fact that we read only their their statement without much understanding of the the history and so how many people don't have I mean I'm sure there's a a bunch of there's a bunch of people that didn't have the the the history of it it's just like you can't understand the change of it and so I mean I'm I'm I'm eating some serious Crow right now I'm eating some pretty serious Crow right now because I was out there like and then now I'm just like it's okay it's okay you're okay man I I damn anyways they have to have known the consequences of their actions we've seen those exact scenarios play guys I did have the flu okay I I had the flu I I I I was taking medication for the flu I'm sorry for what I said before in the end it is hard to see how this is not a big cash grab by a massively V funded company where the investors finally wanted to see a return an investment can I be real here for a second just a little quick second just a little quick thing I love Investments capitalism stock market and all those things but the constant drive for greater and greater returns has most certainly caused a lot of issues and it does make me sad you know what I mean like don't get me wrong I'm not a fool I don't somehow think that that some alternative system is just gallons ahead right the problem is is that greed alone is bad right greed with virtue like if Society said we don't need to make as much money but we want to make like a good Market where people can exist like that's a good thing right I think we can all agree with that but man The Continuous the Unicorn internet ultra wealthy potentials has really caused like a lot of problems and it makes me a little bit sag about it you know what I mean because really what happened here is I mean you can you can just watch it happen like it's it's it's this 300 whatever million dollar investment coming home to roost right rampid greed is damaging everything uh I mean I think I think the underlying thing the underlying truth to this is that any of like the bad motivations even if the initial outcome is good does lead to a lot of a lot of problems and nuke he licensing the co-founder over Bengal stepped down as a CEO and was replaced by Ren tou who is also the person that published a license change announcement on their blog Wen trob was not involved with r before whatsoever he was previously the CEO of a call center provider called 59 and was probably put in this position by investors to finally make the company profitable is this Jack Attack is that who we're seeing right here is this Jack Attack for those that don't know the reference what's Jack's last name avato Jack Attack was the brought in CEO that makes the box it's from Silicon Valley and and he comes in as Jack Attack and Barker the conjoined triangles of success like is this guy the conj dude is Rohan trop trollope is he the conjoined triangles of success action Jack Barker literally is this guy [Laughter] literally oh my goodness the story somehow is actually worse than what it was before how's it gotten this bad damn I know I know the fact that troll in is in his name it's just too on the nose is this nominative determinism is this what this is supposed to be it's unreal I know is this nominative determinism like this has to be right Silicon Valley writers didn't even realize they were both saying what existed and accidentally predicted the future where is the company will will probably make a lot of money in the coming months and maybe even years from companies that use Redd is deeply integrated into the stack or as a hosted service but this comes at a cost the cost of losing such a beloved open source project hold on I have to do something flip marker marker flip it's a marker marker flip take it out you know he would sometimes leave those in just to mess with me do you know that flip he literally called me up and he said that he spends most of my his time he said it in more colorful language than I'm going to say it he spends most of my time or his time making me not look like an idiot just to find times to make me look like an idiot and there's like this irony here that he lives he lives this this dual life where one half he's just like well I got to prevent you from looking like an idiot and then on the other side he's like and you're an idiot there is a debate to be had about the funding of open- source projects but this is not about funding AWS and Alibaba showed that they are willing to contribute to this project by paying people to work on redice while there are way too many of them this I think the hard part I have generally with with with this stuff right or they're just like Alibaba and Amazon are going to you know pay them to work on this product the money in versus the money out is incredible like what they're getting out of what they're putting in is like an investment that any sane person would make add infinitum and it's one of the hard Parts I have is that redis will still or reddis 2 whatever we're going to call it um is still going to have a lot of the probably some very similar funding issues and so I don't see like I don't know how much it's going to change you know I it's always sad I mean I think open source is is wonderful and sad all at the exact same time because there's just so many issues to begin with you know they never had a funding issue they've never had funding issues I just somehow doubt that I don't really know much of any projects that aren't always wishing they could have more funding right open source is rough open source is rough this is not a story about faed open source funding this is a story about a company that failed to out compete the competition was pressured by investors to deliver and did so by destroying it for everyone else as of the moment I'm recording this video neither anti nor the two other main contributors employed by Rister company have spoken up about the LI is that literally Gil foil change so we do not really know what happened behind the scenes or what their actual opinion about all of this is but it is hard to see how they are not feeling wared by all of what happened if you want to find out more about the history of anti-ras and reddis I highly recommend you to check out this blog post which I Linked In the description down below if you want to see what antes is up to now and better understand how he views the world you should take a look at his blog where he regularly posts updates on his projects since leaving redis he also wrote a science fiction book about artificial intelligence and also one man's living the dream out there writing books that previous one was doing something with doing something with hardware and not using a digital analog converter the the the man's out there renaissanc thing right now he's probably wearing a shirt with poofy sleeves one more special shout out to this blog post by momento who I might have stolen some memes from all the sources for this video are linked in the description down below I hope those memes were MIT what happen if those memes weren't properly licensed then what this might slowly disappear over the next few years but the art of antes and its Legacy will live on see you in the next video Dang there was a lot to that there was a lot lot I was not ready for that damn someone's did whoa did you guys see that damn someone's putting I'm definitely not attracted to a a bunny is this Lola I definitely not attracted to a bunny guys um okay is this furries or is what what's her name is it Lola is that from Space Jam okay is that the space j furry confirm okay it's not a I'm not a furry you're programmer airgo for okay okay okay there okay there um man that's a that was a that was a much deeper that was
