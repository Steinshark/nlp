ladies and gentlemen I got a question for you where is the weirdest place that you've played a game of chess of course you've played it at your job you've played it at your home you've probably played it in school and gotten some teachers upset with you I don't know maybe played in a public park train what about a sauna against another individual wedding funeral what about outer space can any of you say that you've played a game in outer space that is the purpose of today's video this game was sent to me by an individual at NASA like real NASA not like a spam email pretending to be NASA because trust me as creators we get plenty of garbage emails from people that aren't actually uh human um this is not that this is a chess game that just finished between Mission Control in Houston Texas and a group of astronauts on the International Space Station which floats hundreds of miles above the earth I think I think that's correct if it's wrong I apologize and this is actually a series they're playing more games and they get Grandmaster titles because they have Cool Jobs they're not actually Grand Masters they're just chess enthusiasts and it made for really nice and fun content so I'm going to share it with you and let me know if you enjoy this and we can see if the losing side will be able to get revenge in game number two uh also that'd be really cool if I could play in outer space but I'm too terrified of that uh Mission Control uh in Houston Texas began the game with Pawn to E3 unconventional move but you could say going to outer space is unconventional in the first place so can you really blame them and black responded with the move E5 principled move taking the center white plays Knight F3 which immediately by the computer is deemed as an inaccuracy uh it's deemed as an inaccuracy because it allows black to play the move E4 and E4 is a good move which takes Center has to kick White's night around white has to kick their Knight around and then you know black can start playing C5 and taking a lot of space and bringing the knights and it's not a it's not a horrible move I mean Knight F3 is basically like a very annoying teacher in school that you know docs points from your test for like any reason but black just plays principle Knight C6 white plays D4 very good stuff in the opening thus far and if you notice that neither side has an ELO that's deliberate because uh well we can guess it you know it's a group of individuals playing so maybe take their average elope D4 is a good move black plays E4 uh and now this is a very different story than the E4 I showed you just a moment ago because a moment ago white needed to move into the center now white can go here and this Pawn actually there's an argument to be made that it's overextended because if black plays the move D5 defending it you immediately play C4 and I don't know how you're going to support the center and the center Pawn because after Knight F6 something like this white chest has a clean and very very healthy extra pawn and then white will go here and here and Castle uh I don't like what mission control does here because in chess as you improve you're going to learn uh you're gonna kind of learn a concept to a point and then you're going to tear down that concept and relearn it for example in the early stages of the game if you're training a knight for a night it's good and that's that then you're gonna get to a level where it's like nope in every exchange of pieces there is a winner and a loser one side is usually more happy and in this case uh it's actually black who is more happy because this Pawn is very tough to defend and that pawn can be attacked and you can also use that pawn as a trading mechanism to further your own development so you just used white to develop more in the game uh the astronauts play something very deviant they play the move C6 which on its own is not a great move because you're not actually getting anything developed but there is a really nasty threat and also this can be used as a building block you can try to play Pawn to do five later the Deviant threat here is playing the queen out to A5 which is so nasty they want to Fork Mission controls King yo they got to be careful by the way taking Mission controls pieces because I'm pretty sure Mission Control can give them the wrong instructions home and I don't know they better end up on Uranus or something that's not actually how you pronounce I think technically it's Uranus but I'm seven years old at heart so you know uh is Pluto a planet by the way I know it like wasn't has it been reinstated did it like go to Planet rehab I I I haven't kept up with all that but this is their idea they want to capture Mission controls Pawn in the center um Knight C3 though is played and that move doesn't necessarily defend against the threat uh but Queen A5 is still possible it's actually kind of tough to defend this Pawn but this Pawn is now under attack uh they play Queen to A5 and uh the pressure was still on the pond here and here oh my goodness Mission controls fine finds a fantastic move uh here they defend and attack at the same time you can say they protect they attack uh but most importantly they bring astronauts back and that's uh Queen to D4 uh they defend the pawn on E5 from the queen on A5 this is under Fire and white is on the verge of getting a fantastic position the computer here finds I think what the computer wants is the move F5 yes okay and the point is that you defend this and if I guess you have Knight takes and uh and you're fine I guess that's the idea maybe there's something else I don't think it's D5 because that just loses yeah that looks really bad so I I don't actually know why the computer is unconvinced here of the pressure I'm pretty convinced I don't know I mean the attack here looks very very menacing but of course I mean the computer will will always find something um they play Bishop B4 which is given a double question mark which I think is a bit harsh I mean look at the stockfish eval it's 0.6 like why is it giving them you know I guess it's different types of uh of stockfishes this is as far as I'm concerned an excellent move a lot of noobs here would go here because it develops a piece but that just hangs a clean Pawn uh that's not any good Bishop B4 is what you call a tactical defense it essentially prevents the threat of Queen takes Pawn by threatening a tactic somewhere else which is great it's a great move now what white should probably do is attack the bishop that's what I would do uh get this don't trade bring your Bishop bring your other Bishop castle and then with the queen in the center you always have you know the queen is a violent piece uh things can open up very quickly for the queen so E6 is very very reasonable uh Bishop D2 is probably the best move though um because now the knights movement is re-enabled and also the Queen's movement is re-enabled because the bishop is defending the Knight so excellent stuff um International Space Station plays F6 I don't hate this move uh the point is again that you are actually striking back at the center and if Pawn takes F6 there's Knight takes F6 and black has gotten development uh black is a move away from being in fantastic shape for instance Bishop E2 black is gonna go D5 uh Black's position is really nice visually Queen has sort of got no targets now so it's very important right now for Mission Control to strike all right it's important that they do something right now um and don't just kind of lazily play on and again this is what I just mentioned in chess you learn Concepts to a level and then you have to play in a different way like you have to put asterisks you don't always have to do that for example here uh for a beginner I would say move the bishop and castle that's what I would say like just move the bishop and Castle or Castle right now you know castle in the other direction um but actually right now there are there's an opportunity for white to get an upper hand and I think they can get an upper hand with the move A3 because black is stretched a bit thin here and their King is still stuck in the center so by creating threats that do not weaken your position in any way you can create long-term improvements and you can make beneficial exchanges for instance if black packs up to E7 suddenly The Queen Is Under Fire and uh Black's in serious trouble after something like this and then you know if the queen goes back there's Knight D6 and it can get very bad the computer is not convinced because the computer's a scumbag um but Bishop C3 Bishop C3 now white has a major advantage uh as far as I'm concerned again computer completely unimpressed and is sitting there trying to tell you that it's equal um you will see it's a very difficult position to maintain why because black traded a dark squared Bishop but has five out of seven pawns on light squares so you have a light squared Bishop stuck behind a bunch of light squared Pawns right and you don't have a dark squared Bishop anymore white is also more developed white has the more powerful diagonal attackers on an open board uh White is very happy here probably black should trade Queens if I'm being honest black should probably try to Queen trade uh in the game uh International Space Station plays Queen F5 which is also a pretty reasonable move and as I've just been saying uh there is Bishop E2 there is castling either way I love White's next move which is long Castle love this move um on the surface it hangs upon but it is look at the advantage that white gets if black takes a free Pawn it's it's really Sensational stuff it's the reason is the lack of development and the poor King safety so right now probably something like Queen E5 is good uh and black is forced to move the king out of check and if black tries to stick around in the center it's probably going to go from bad to worse I mean I imagine white can play Bishop C4 I imagine white can bring something to D6 maybe you need to guard this I'm not so convinced you need to guard that pawn I think you can play Bishop C4 okay you lost the touch of Advantage but it's still fine and Black's just like in no position to fight back with a move like D5 because there's no threat I mean there's simply no threat so you can play Rook F1 then sacrifice and etc etc I'm doing this blind I don't have the engine open uh but uh yeah Queen F2 is too dangerous so black plays D5 uh and I actually hear the International Space Station won a game within a game they won Connect Four I don't know if they were you know playing the new version of Chess where you win if you put four Pawns in a row uh and right now what white needs to do is open up the board like what's the game plan right in chess everybody struggles in this phase of the game like this is in chess single-handedly the hardest thing the opening is over what now well you always look for checks captures and attacks in this position the only check white has this queen E5 and if I asked you like who is happier with the queen trade it's very tough to say but it's probably black because Black's King is still in the center so a queen trade look what happens to the eval it plummets right I mean it's back to roughly roughly equal but uh white doesn't have any substantial threats so you don't want to play Queen E5 so what do you want to do maybe bishop E2 or something you also want a pawn break you want to break these apart because your position will improve drastically if you can get into Black's position so white snacks move is really interesting it's F4 it's not really a pawn break unless you play on passant but if you don't play on poisson like let's just say you develop then white is going to start very quickly look at this look oh my God look at that eval all of a sudden the pawn wave is coming and there's a fork and that leads to some good stuff and now you're a piece up I got news for you it's not it's not over anytime soon and I have a cannonball of a battery pointed at that direction so I mean I'll say things are going pretty well right so black plays e takes F3 black actually does take on passant and here Mission Control gets a little bit spicy all right Mission Control gets a little bit spicy and what they should do is of course take back don't over complicate things just like going to space you know you over complicate things could go real bad um you don't want to play hope chess in chess Sometimes the best move is just the simplest you want to recapture if you don't want to recapture go here because it develops a piece and it attacks the queen but just simple a kiss keep it simple stupid all right they're not stupid they're really smart but I'm just saying keep it simple like G takes F3 why okay yes this attacks a couple of things but we just developed also that's not a real threat so you can just take the file right if castles they're castling directly into the barrel of The Rook so that's not any good instead after onpasson uh Mission Control plays Bishop C4 how many of you have played moves like this and if you think moves that just hang a bishop that's not what that is you are all more than capable of doing that but moves that are like I'm gonna play a move because my idea is if they take me I have Queen d8 yes everything you just said is right I'm gonna play this move if they take me queen d8 is the verdict of that thought move no because you never thought of I play my move what if they don't take me you only proved yourself right but you need to disprove yourself and that is why in this position International Space Station just played here they just took another Pawn because they're not going to take the bishop they saw the threat right so now white has to respond right and uh and and in this position um International again keep it simple right keep it simple Rook G1 rookie one you know go here and listen look castles now now that's a real threat it wasn't a threat to move ago so don't have tunnel vision back up and look white can get back into the game very quickly I mean I'm telling you these cannons pointed in this direction it's ugly and I mean it's real ugly like there could be sacrifices looming this might be a little bit rushed but all of this is possible and there's a very different type of sacrifice because the way I just sacrificed the bishop was a forcing sacrifice there's a difference between how you sacrifice this is opening the king he's got no choice the move Bishop C4 however uh it is a choice black doesn't have to take at all there's no right um so now Bishop D3 is played attacking the queen and here uh International Space Station deserves uh a brilliant move for this uh they play Pawn takes rook and they make another queen and that was missed again you don't need to move the queen if you can get another queen and now we got a situation here on our hands uh and uh Rook H1 is played but unfortunately after all of this black now gets to move their Queen and it's just upper Rook they are just up a rook but it's not over H4 and you'll notice that the black king is still in the center Queen to G4 Queen E5 check all right now there are plenty of ways to lose games of material look at this look at the eval it's back to nearly equal despite blank beat Black being up a rook because three of Black's pieces aren't playing and the king is about to get butchered look at this Rook F6 is on the way white is winning you could be down a p you could be down a rogue but completely winning Bishop before King F7 here's a way to lose just straight up lose the game right so in in chess the two most important things are material in King safety Queen E6 Queen G5 castles like gets the king to safety and now has sufficient defenses in place look at this Rook G1 H5 literally white utilizing every resource but the problem in chess is that you need two more attacking pieces than Defenders black is solid and let's not forget black is upper Rook so black is bringing help that is fantastic stuff Bishop before trying to take away some squares um black plays Knight E4 and now the fun is over uh because the bishop is blocked and now the queen is under attack and black begins active counter play B6 C5 trying to kick out the bishop anywhere the bishop moves it's gonna get taken and one of the ways to win a game of chess is to attack the opponent the other way is simplification Knight takes Bishop that's a fantastic move now white is down to three pieces and I told you one of the other ways to win the game is just a crushing attack using your material advantage D4 and that opens the door to the queen and that's fatal because uh White has to cover that and lose this Pawn now the bishop is activated on the diagonal and um Mission Control here tries to go for danger levels hitting the queen and the queen here but uh I mean I I would just take I wouldn't even you could just simplify but unfortunately Queen F6 is just a brilliant move I mean queen F6 is a sensational move by the International Space Station the queen is hit and even though the Rook can be taken with check black plays the move King f8 now there are no checks on the king the queen is hit and it's not just the queen because the queen on F6 was threatening Queen A1 mate I mean that was a surgical technique by the International Space Station team they pushed the d-pawn to infiltrate with the queen White had to stop that so they took and now the pawn prevents the king Escape and they met the queen attack with Queen F6 which was only made possible because you forced white to play B3 so D4 forced B3 opened up the I mean that opened up the diagonal and just incredible stuff black in this game uh I don't know what their average rating is um they didn't play uh perfectly but I would say I mean listen they played like 16 1700 level chess white probably played around more like 1100 1200 level Chess at least in particular in this game but again a lot of it comes down to the opening like the opening was very shaky for white and black played quite well this move I don't think deserves two two question marks uh and uh yeah I mean black was you know like kept it simple white played a couple of risky moves here and they sort of backfired um but I can see this also being like you know a 1500 playing with white just sort of like going for tricks and they don't work and then oops and black just converted so the score is one to nothing International Space Station leads over Mission Control let me know if you'd like to continue the series and um this is day three of uh day two of vacation with the plant we've got a few more days to go and then we'll be back home get out of here
