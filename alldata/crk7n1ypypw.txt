hello in today's video i'm gonna be doing a setup tour [Music] i've redesigned my setup quite a bit recently especially the stuff over here and i put a photo of it on discord a few weeks ago when i finished it and lots of people expressed some interest and asked to see like a full video on it so i'm going to show the new setup basically but first a word from today's sponsor today's video is sponsored by wing fox wing fox is an online video course platform they've got loads of stuff related to vfx they have an actual cg vfx category and they also have similar categories for things like game art concept design animation film production etc they have loads of courses very similar to the stuff that i teach on my youtube channel they asked me to pick one specifically that i thought would be good to recommend to my viewers and i chose this one here this is a course that covers making a cinematic car chase in blender at the moment the course is only 19 it lasts seven and a half hours and it's an intermediate difficulty level if you're interested in checking out this course or any of the similar courses on wing fox i'll leave an affiliate link in the description where you can find more information so i guess let's start with the most eye-catching part of the setup which is probably the three monitors my main display is an lg gaming ultra wide the one off to the right is a 1440p benq monitor and then the one at the top is just a dell 1080p normal monitor for vfx i rarely use more than the main monitor but for editing i really like to have all three i have the timeline on the ultrawide then i have the playback on the right hand side monitor i shoot everything in 4k so it's nice to view it on a high resolution monitor and then i have all of my footage and media bins and everything on the top and i find this a really comfortable setup for editing audio wise i have two krk rocket fives i got these mainly for music work but i use them every day just for playing music out of while i'm working so i like to crank them up nice and loud they sound really really good they're really nice speakers i also have a pair of headphones which are currently hung up under the desk and the output to the speakers and the headphones comes out of this rack unit that i have on my desk it's all plugged into an audio interface in the middle and then i have a patch bay and a compressor and a preamp and a few eqs and things along the bottom this is all hardware analog recording equipment when i do music stuff and it also doubles as the audio interface going into my pc for recording things like voiceovers for peripherals i have an rgb mechanical gaming keyboard i have a wacom intuos pro medium which is the graphics tablet that i use this thing's done a lot of mileage especially since kovid and i'm now working remotely as a vfx artist most days a week apart from when i'm in the office and i also still have the toolbox neo on my desk if you watch all of my videos you've probably already seen this i got sent it by a company called toolbox it's basically a little macro keyboard you can bind loads of custom shortcuts to then down to the workhorse of this whole setup my pc i recently upgraded my graphics card to an rtx 3090 and it's absolutely amazing the other main parts are an intel i7 6700k processor i've got 32 gigs of ddr4 ram and i've got three terabytes of mechanical hard drives and an ssd with windows and stuff on it so it runs really quickly this is what the setup looks like in the dark but for when i'm recording videos with a face cam i have a big soft box off to the top left-hand side of my setup on a c-stand it's controlled by a smart plug that's connected to the google home in my living room so i can turn it on with my voice hey google turn on video lights that's pretty much all the stuff on the desk then also attached to the desk i have my rode ntg-1 which is my recording microphone it's on a road broadcasting arm so that it's out of the way then i can pull it down whenever i want to record something off to the right is stuff that you guys never see on camera i've got some draw units that are just full of music cables and stuff there's a few things from when i've been to harry potter world you can see the lightsaber there from my star wars short film stuff that i don't really have the heart to throw away then off to the right is my guitar amp and for some reason it has a matching orange skateboard on top of it these are the two drawers that are just absolutely full of music cables then to the right of that this is stuff that's directly behind me when i'm sat at the desk this is a neumann tlm3 studio condenser mic i also have a full sized keyboard behind me not that i can really play piano particularly well and then one of my favorite things in this room my rack full of guitars on the floor is the pedalboard these are all the guitar effects and then above that obviously is all of the guitars and lurking in the background there balanced on the radiator you can see my snowboard as well and this is a look at the whole thing if i slowly walk backwards through the room this is my little creative hub this is where i make all of my youtube videos and music from it's a really nice creative cozy space so there we go that's an update on my setup i've built it in a way that i think is the best for the way i work and it allows me to be as creative as possible with as few limitations as i can physically avoid it's also adapted a fair bit since everyone started working from home post pandemic i've changed quite a few things around so that it's optimized for allowing me to work professionally from home and then also having my personal setup in the same place look at that editing magic i apologize for the drop in quality i'm on my phone now because my camera battery is charging but i'm just going to very quickly elaborate on that point about working from home because i forgot to touch on it earlier basically in this horrible mess down here in this drawer i have basically a second computer set up this box here is a box made by dell that you plug an ethernet cable and your keyboard and stuff into and it allows me to control my work machine at the mill so basically i have a displayport switcher and a usb switcher in here so i can switch my keyboard and mouse and this monitor from my pc to the dell box so i can go back and forth and it means that nine to six in the week i can have my work set up here and i don't have to go behind the desk and unplug anything or have a separate monitor and then when i log off at the end of the day from work i can literally press the usb switcher and the displayport switcher and then the monitor will switch back to my pc and i can flip my keyboard and mouse between the two as well and also the wacom tablet so it's pretty hideous it all comes out of a hole that i've drilled in the back of the desk but my idea with this is basically that the draw can be shut and you would never know from looking at it that i had a second computer set up in there so hopefully you enjoyed i'm sure the people that geek out on setups will have absolutely
