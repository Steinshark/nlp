inside this box is not one not two but eight top of the line 16 core ryzen 7000 gaming CPUs and I know what you're thinking this makes no sense oh it just broke it even if super micro was crazy enough to put consumer chips in a server they don't support multi-chip configurations ah ah they don't need to every one of these rear blades contains everything you need for an entire PC networking pcie expansion storage power CPU and RAM which there's no Ram there's no CPU this is a system for that but sir this is LTT I can't make a video without any CPUs but we don't have the CPU they don't have a seat sir I could pee into the AMD Booth from here tell you what get me power get me networking and I swear to you I will not leave this exhibition haul until I find a CPU and RAM for that matter and power the Sun the people need to see this beast in action and I swear to you that I will not begin my quest until I finish this segue to our sponsor us wait what all right LTX 2023 come hang out with us on July 29th and 30th in Vancouver Canada it's a city we have over 65 Creator guests tons of activities swag and more get your ticket today at the link below realistically we probably don't even have to go to AMD for this anyone who's got an overclocking demo is going to know they're probably going to kill some CPUs we need RAM G skill let's go [Music] where the hell is g-skill oh it's right there oh yeah OC World Cup they're definitely gonna have CP they're gonna have trees of CPUs I really hope Waze there I want to see him yeah Frank Frank's good too Frank is here hi Frank and we'll find ways soon don't worry Frank do your thing see you later uh I can't find my way okay I'm leaving goodbye well I thought I was gonna find him right away yeah oh my God insufferable if he's eating we might have to wait I don't know if I can wait any longer oh my god really now you're doing its way okay we have a problem okay that's the problem and I know that I probably should have warned you but I didn't want to he said not to we found a computer yes that uh is kind of cool this is an am5 computer but it has no CPU and no RAM and we thought maybe you could help us sure can you find a way to help us oh my god oh we get you the ramp yep oh I need a CPU we need CPUs too okay you have you have an OC World Cup over there you must have CPUs [Music] what what are you kidding oh my God I didn't think that this could be there is no way one of these computers none of them have AMD there is AMD ones but I have a screwdriver [Music] I don't have to ask who you can just say that we stole it all right tell you what let's start with the ram but you're not allowed to ask permission it has to be a surprise when the video goes up otherwise it's no fun if it's a problem we will make it up to you you can be our new Ram specialist at the lab give you a job how about we put it this way if you can't get Ram we'll go to Team group oh no oh my God how are how are none of these systems oh here's here's one oh that makes sense because you guys want to show high speed memory can we power this one down temporarily we'll bring it back I promise like today we'll bring it back today in an hour here let me help you thank you way we'll be we'll be waiting oh wait this is the 48 gig sticks what uh oh well Jesus Trident Z5 Royal boys we can get started on the ram before he gets back with the CPU hey thank you oh my God oh my God bulk thermal paste I love it can we take the heat spreader off oh my God and you're giving me a hard time for asking for so much I mean we're already this can we take the heat spreader off or do you have one that doesn't have a heat spreader well those guys got to have heat guns at the OC World Cup and to think we could have given him a heads up well we could have after all he's gone through we have to show g-skill memory worst case scenario we just leave the next note over empty and we put this one in oh my God he's back with a heat gun he's never appeared on the channel before but this is our G skill rep we make life really easy for him right yeah sweating poor guy you like my Hello Kitty Transit card oh my God Jake it's cute tell me if I'm like burning you or anything it's a little warm yeah go yeah go left I'm trying not to burn your fingers oh you got gloves no we don't need those anymore we're going gloves these are not gonna fit me I'll wear the gloves yeah okay so the small hands yeah we got it small hands are my superpower okay watch out Jake watch out I'm lifting it up just don't want to pry the ICS off of the memory module success on the one side give me some g-skill talking points fast memory for gamers so fast that the heat spreaders just fall right off with a heat gun and a plastic card oh my God Jake that's not so fast by the ram that's a Byler Ram this is the worst thing we've ever done this is how you overclock right by the way the new Royale memory looks amazing If You're Gonna Go cringe I say go full cringe I love it now obviously we wouldn't recommend taking the spreaders off of your G skill memory they do actually serve a function especially if you're running at high speeds and also they look really cool but nothing should prevent them from functioning like this and now they're low profile enough to fit in our server module plus it's going to be in a server with a lot of airflow which desktop computers not so much oh wow there's so much thermal compound I think uh I think we're good thank you okay I'm gonna do one of my trademark uh vertical CPU removals okay thank you bye see you soon I'll cover you the evidence and we're back all I gotta do is put these little shrouds that I took off earlier back on oh my God these are finicky why are these even here yeah what is the point of these all they do is cover the ram this is a airstrike that we can cover it so we can make sure the old airport will go through the CPU oh so we don't want cooling on the ram just just a little bit just a little bit tiny cooling oh yes tiny coating ah okay okay okay all right I'll figure out how to put it on then I don't have anything yeah they're looking we could go on another side quest and get a USB to ethernet dongle I think the CEO framework is kicking around on the show floor maybe he has them what about that laptop is it for a specific demo oh thank God oh my God I've never wanted to see you more in my life we're at the super microwave I'm filming right now hi this is Sasha he's like one of our Asus contacts he's awesome we're at the super micro Booth we're trying to do a video on a server I want to connect to it via Ethernet but I don't have ethernet on my laptop I need a laptop that has Ethernet or like a USBC to ethernet a laptop would be better because then I can very easily do an ASU shout out easier to do because we have Spears for us yeah if you have a laptop that has ethernet though of course of course like a big one like this one right here see look how's ethernet right there well Jake's on our second side quest I'm gonna run you guys through what this is exactly and what it's for at its heart is an am5 socket supporting up to the ryzen 7950 X 3D and that seems like a really weird choice for our server CPU even if we factor in that AMD does unofficially support ECC memory but it's not as weird as it sounds because server products tend to focus on performance for what efficiency is King in the data center but that tends to come at the cost of Maximum per thread performance whereas gaming CPUs are all about boosting as high as possible so for certain server applications like Game servers where customers want High single threaded performance and tend to be price sensitive something like this is fantastic each blade supports up to 128 gigs of ddr5 memory three nbme storage devices one on here and then two in the front for each one and up to 25 gigabit networking and when you consider that you can pack eight of them into just a 3u chassis it's a really attractive option yes does it work it's already on yes I'll be back in like half an hour thank you now just because it's a consumer CPU at its core doesn't mean that you're likely to use this for your gaming rig oh speaking of gaming rigs very nice I got the world's most baller ethernet Jack you could fit almost nothing in here in terms of gaming Graphics but what it lacks in gaming prowess it makes up for in manageability it has a single ipmi Network Management Port here that actually assigns eight different IPS to all the different nodes and it has a built-in switch so you can daisy chain this chassis to the next to the next to the next making the deployment super simple you know we've got a cable management product coming really soon that I think would be just great for you guys still haven't decided what to call them though leave a comment if you have some ideas hey it's this guy you remember him co-starring in our uh promotional videos we were doing there you go yeah you did great thank you oh hey there she goes boys okay Jake I hope you're ready I gotta like do configuration so there's actually an indicator light to show which ones are active this is the one we put a CPU in Ram in so it gets a green light and these ones all get no green lights it's working I had to set a static IP on this interface and then I restarted it and now it's found DHCP discover so okay so theoretically we can manage it now oh wow we don't have to manage it over the network they've got a standard KVM Port back here that'll do serial USB and VGA and then they've also got a USBC port on this thing so I guess that's cool but we're gonna log into the oh I never mentioned the Redundant power supplies 2200 Watts wow you could probably do the whole thing off just one of these then wow that's not a lot of power look it's got a web interface too there we go there's all our IPS okay so I had to set a static IP in Windows for that interface and then it just finds any interface with the static IP and runs the HTTP so you've got all eight of them yeah look at that okay let's find the working one like can I unplug a blade while it's on okay 5c hopefully I put this in the right way it's awake now the question is do we know what the default password is admin admin what are the odds I start with that well they don't usually do that anymore oh it is that okay usually super micro servers now have a randomly generated one which is better better But I hate it CPU memory oh yeah look at that it's even got to navigate things so fast this is cool oh well yeah okay like the power supply warning and you know let me drive stop touching 79.50x that's working that's sick what about the ram did it manage our weird 40. it has one stick and it thinks it's a 16 gig stick okay well g-scope they make great gaming memory I probably wouldn't rip the spreaders off and put it in a server it might just need a firmware update because realistically the memory controller is on the CPU yeah and it should be actually fairly board agnostic but you can still run into issues oh cool so under the power supply menu in each of the nodes it shows you all the other nodes and it also shows the power consumption this is super cool and all but I would love to see one that actually has room for a GPU land centers or something like internet cafe yeah baller internet cafe yeah 37 degrees on the CPU considering how freaking hot it is even with the AC running in here I consider that a win the ramp the Ram's only 29 degrees Yeah I mean assuming it's reading that sensor correctly given it has no idea what's in it yeah it thinks it's a 16 gig stick of RAM and it only detects one of them so we might have killed one oh look at this multi-node and if I click on one it opens the ipmi for that one oh that's super cool and you can pick each one and it shows you all of the different things power consumption fan speed well I consider this a win yeah all right let's look at some of the more conventional servers this is interesting in front of me I have the infamous Ponte Vecchio also known as sorry Intel GPU Max 1550. there's eight of them in this 8U chassis and this was meant to be a competitor to nvidia's a100 series and then it was very very very late the good news is that it actually is competitive against h-100 the successor to the a100 in certain workloads uh like HPC for example you might want to use it for simulation but it's not competitive in AI but word on the street is that it could be available for as little as around half of the price making this the budget multi hundred thousand dollar solution to be clear Intel has certainly made some improvements to help it compete with current gen this is all pcie Gen 5 connectivity and rather than using pcie for GPU to GPU communication they're using what they call xelink which turns the 128 gigabytes of hbm or high bandwidth memory on each of these GPU packages into a total of one terabyte of memory that's accessible to all eight gpus that's pretty cool for HPC workloads even with that Advantage though Intel's in a bit of an interesting bind with this product because for very small customers who might be looking to Save A Buck they're gonna have to redo a lot of their software to make use of this making it maybe impractical and then for large customers well they can afford the Nvidia solution anyway so they might as well just get the industry leader so hopefully they find a customer for this but uh maybe it doesn't matter we can just wait for next gen assuming that ever arrives this is one hell of a beefy cooler what are these things let me guess let me guess let me guess 600 watts really yes like exactly right or a little bit over under exactly I'm good at this point what if anything would prevent me from removing the processor itself yeah I mean yeah it doesn't seem like your problem right I mean realistically as long as the video has like a million and a half two million views by the time the HQ sees it you're not going to get in trouble this is the best thing about trade shows because you get to interact directly with the people who kind of don't give up now it's moving a little I think I may have undone entirely the wrong screws to start okay now I'm a little scared because this is taking more Force than I'm accustomed to what is wrong with it well what wouldn't you do the same thing I mean yeah but like what about these little ones hold on maybe there's more oh yeah just takes a professional ah what the hell you made me think this was a real one okay well what am I holding but this board is just for a show okay so there would be an actual interface there for this okay highly confidential trade secret authorized SCC blah blah development only hopefully I can figure out how to get this back together or hopefully someone here can figure out how to get this back together more realistically woke wow I mean I guess that's what happens when you pack one of the most complex chips ever conceived and 600 watts of power delivery onto a board the size of freaking a mid-range GPU see part of me was expecting to see memory around this kind of like we saw with nvidia's Grace Superchip but that wouldn't be the case it's hbm so it's right on that gigantic complicated Ponte Vecchio package under here does anyone know how this goes back together don't worry about it just put it on our team yeah you guys will figure it out okay I'll put this here I mean this is all like broken anyway right or does these do these work well not yet wow yeah all right thank you very much for being so accommodating you guys hey it's us again ever wonder what it's like making one of these videos floatplane is a great place for you to get to know
