[Music] the original super mario bros has to be one of the most iconic and well-known video games of all time it was one of the first games ever released to feature the now widely recognized mario it was bundled with the original nes when it came out back in 1985 and as a result millions upon millions of people have played it but of all those people a few like to push the game to its absolute limit right up to its breaking point and beat it faster than most can ever imagine [Music] [Music] super mario bros has become one of the most popular speedruns to watch over the past few years and part of that can be contributed to its short length it's exciting when watching the stream to think that at any point a new world record could be set in only 5 minutes for over a decade players have come and gone each one grinding the record down a little bit further than the last and today i'm going to show you how the time has progressed over time to start it's necessary to understand that the way you can gain or lose time in this game is different to a standard video game because of what runners call the frame rule players can only lose or gain time in increments of 21 frames or approximately 0.35 seconds in every level other than class level 8-4 this is because whenever you finish a level the game only checks for completion every 21 frames instead of every frame to quote current world record holder derbian it's as if at the end of every level a bus arrives every 21 frames to bring it to the next level even if you missed the bus by just one frame you would still have to wait 20 frames to catch the next bus sometimes though you'll arrive just before a bus does you'll hardly have to wait at all of course this doesn't apply on the last level since timing stops immediately once you touch the axe at the end although a speedrun of this game is short there's quite a bit that goes into it 1-1 is simple enough you run through take the underground pipe and finish the level 1-2 is an underground level with a few precise jumps but due to the frame rule system you could actually afford to slow down a little bit and not lose any time at the end use the warp zone to go to world 4. 4-1 is really easy you just run through and beat the level in 4-2 you need to take an above-ground warp pipe to go to world 8. this world is where the ground gets really really brutal 8-1 is the longest level in the game and it features some of the toughest jumps in the entire run 8-2 is another long level with koopas that can spawn in different positions that can trip you up 8-3 is filled top to bottom with hammer bros and their patterns can sometimes kill you no matter what you do finally the last level 8-4 features it all brutal jumps a precise water section hamburger brothers and of course bowser at the end the first run that we're going to look at is scott kessler's 510 which he achieved back in april 2004 this run was riddled with imperfections but it didn't matter to most back in 2004 speedrunning was a fraction of the size of what it is today so minor mistakes were largely overlooked the fact that kessler is able to beat this 20 year old game with such precision and skill boggled the mind of so many one thing to note is that back when this run came out it was believed that hitting the top versus the bottom of the flagpole didn't matter since either way the flag would have to slide from the top to the bottom keep this in mind for later months passed and another runner came out of nowhere to challenge kessler trevor sagan sagan and kessler took turns lowering the record from 510 to 507 then to 506. this 506 stood for a couple of years and in that time four players were able to tie it including a 16 year old under the username andrew g in 1990 finally though in september 2006 scott kessler achieved a 505 which in the opinion of most runners at the time seemed to be a pretty much perfect run and from watching the run it's clear why so many people thought this the most difficult sections were executed beautifully and there weren't any visible mistakes so a 505 seemed to be the end of the line for super mario bros unless some major new strategies were discovered and that's exactly what andrew g did since andrew g was just one second away from the record he set out to find as many new strategies as he could the first tone was the decision to stop having super mario bros be a glitchless run there were a couple of known glitches in 8-4 that could save about a second and a half total the first one was a wall jump off of a pipe which required both a pixel perfect and frame perfect input and the second one was a wrong warp with this pipe because super mario bros only had the capability to load one warp zone at a time once you passed a certain point on the screen the game would load the water section so all you have to do is go to this point then turn around and go back to the pipe the reason that neither these glitches were used was because under twin galaxies rules of the time which is where these runs were being submitted to no glitches of any kind were allowed utilizing both of these glitches on top of a perfect run would be able to get the time down to a 504 andrew g wanted something more though he wanted something that would set his run apart from the others so that people could say that his run truly was the best and his answer was in the level that would become infamous for years to come 4-2 normally you just climb up the vine and go to the warp zone while in the process having to watch the cutscene of the vine going up then mario climbing it finally mario getting off andrew realized that the beginning of 4-2 works similarly to the wrong warping a4 if you fool the game into thinking that you're farther back on the screen than you really are and get closer to the right side of the screen then going down this pipe will take you to the warp zone too except it will completely skip the cutscene with the vine the only issue was getting close to the right however one day andrew finally figured it out if you backwards jumped into certain objects in just the right way you'd be pushed to the right typically if you do this three times at the start of 4-2 you'll be far enough to trigger the wrong work to work so now andrew had the strategies he purposely didn't reveal them to anybody and instead grinded the game without telling anyone for months finally in april 2007 his efforts paid off and he's able to cut more than five seconds off of the record unsurprisingly this video blew up on youtube which ushered in a new era of super mario bros speedruns the reign of andrew g once again andrew had achieved what seemed to be a nearly perfect run he had beaten what was already considered a perfect run by five whole seconds so it's no wonder that isran garnered this title for a few more years nobody really got close to beating his time he was on top of the world of the video game that was arguably on top of the retro community that seemed like nobody could touch him but finally in late 2010 andrew g asked himself the question is it possible to beat the game in under 5 minutes he once again started to grind and in december of 2010 he broke through but not quite in the way he wanted to he lowered the time by two tenths of a second and when he took another look at the run he noticed slight imperfections that he could potentially fix so he pushed onward and the very next day christmas eve he was able to cut the five-minute mark finishing with a time of 459.4 for the first time in history somebody could say that they could beat super mario bros in under five minutes andrew had executed everything that he wanted to in this run so he took another break from super mario bros for a while about a year later though a few more improvements came to his attention the biggest one being where to jump on the flagpole in his previous runs if it wasn't easy to jump on top of the flagpole they just jumped wherever they could since they figured they wouldn't lose any time however look at this comparison if you jump at the top instead you don't brush on the block at the bottom and you accelerate more quickly towards the castle this saves a few frames and sometimes saves enough time to get another framework combined with a newer slightly faster method of doing 4-2 andrew once again pushed his time down slightly further this time to a 458.89 another year passed and andrew g came back to the game once more this time he got two more improvements in the same week and streamed the live on twitch [Music] [Music] all right that i don't know what that time [Music] oh my gosh i think i do this again at this point andrew set a goal in mind he wanted to take the time down to a 457 no matter how long it would take him there are a couple of ways to go about it one way was to go for a faster version of 4-2 which would save one frame roll and the other way was to go for the bullet bill glitch which would save two frame rules this glitch involved having the bullet bill shoot at the end of 8-2 then jumping on it in just the right way so that it could clip into the bottom of the flagpole skipping both the flag coming down and mario walk into the castle andrew quickly ruled this method out as it would involve both getting lucky to have the bullet fast enough which almost never happened and getting the glitch to work if it did shoot which also almost never happened it's too slow he decided the only way to do it would be to go for this faster version of 4-2 play the rest of the game absolutely perfectly minus the bullet bill glitch and then play 8-4 as good as anybody had ever played it at the end of a run the main issue with this was the trick that would soon get the nickname fast 4-2 in order to get the wrong work to work you need to be pushed at least 20 pixels to the right if you get pushed 20 pixels you need to go down the first pixel of the pipe if you get 21 pixels you can go down to the first or the second pixel and so on and so forth any backwards jump can push you between 7 and 10 pixels so the way that andrew used to do it was to get pushed three times and then be able to easily go down the pipe with fast 4-2 however you would only get pushed twice you need to get 10 pixels from each bump which is rare and pretty much completely out of your control and then stop on the first pixel of the pipe and go down it even on his best days andrew wasn't able to pull off this trick more than 1 out of every 20 tries and it led to streams of him playing the first four levels over and over again and then resetting but anytime when he got past 4-2 it was as if time stood still there were just four levels separating him from the 457 andrew's usual banter with the chat would stop and everyone watching would be extremely focused for the next few minutes there were only a few moments like this each stream and they more than made up for all the resets in 4-2 and every now and then he had finished a run as a new world record and andrew's reactions were always the best oh my gosh i don't even know [Music] oh my gosh [Music] oh my gosh [Music] what [Music] what [Music] i don't even know [Music] it's gonna be like it's gonna be like 450 8.03 or something i'm gonna die but finally it seemed like the stars had aligned on one room that he had he had gone past fast forward ash2 and was on pace for a 457 all the way and now i might beat my 458 holy crap for those who just tuned in um i broke the warpless record i got uh 1926 i think and now i'm ahead of my work record right now i am a frame rule ahead right now if this is a 457 i'm gonna flip out this is crazy [Music] no [Music] he kept grinding and his time kept dropping but it still remained at 458. finally in march of 2014 his time was just a tenth of a second away from a 457 458.09 ultimately he said he didn't care if he ever achieved the 457. he felt as if he had mastered the game and that he taken the game to where he wanted to after all he still had the world record he was only a tenth of a second away from hitting his ultimate time he had done what he could do with the game and it seemed like nobody could beat him [Music] [Music] one morning in june 2014 speedrun fans around the world woke up to find this video trending on youtube super mario bros beaten 457.6 uploaded by speedrunner blubler in this run leveler opted to not do the fast 4-2 but instead did the bulletproof glitch which saved an extra frame rule from what andrew g was going for how did he get the bullet bill to shoot well turns out enemy patterns can be influenced by what frame rule you're on if you start the game at the same time every time and play through the game on the exact same frame rule you can control when the bullet bill will fire all blubler needed to do was find a good frame rule to start on then play through the level in just the right way without stomping on any koopas which influences the time at which the bulletproof shoots he was able to get the glitch in a run and shocked the world by beating andrew g by four tenths of a second once again this run stood for a while and not many people were really trying to beat it but finally in may 2015 a fairly unknown speedrunner called derby and rose above and got a 457 for himself [Music] what that has to be a 457 and then got another one just two days later both of these runs utilize the bullet bill glitch but not fast 4-2 darby and grinded more and more trying to get closer and closer to the record and then in october 2015 after more than 6 000 attempts he broke through and beat the record by a matter of just 4 frames [Music] i don't know what that was [Music] i have no idea what that was a few months later the game was receiving more attention than it ever had in the past derby was trying to improve his record androgy was trying to take it back and another player by the name of cosmic d12 who was andrew's closest competitor when he was going 4-4-57 was trying to get it for the first time himself they decided that the ultimate time for mario would be when a player got a room with fast 4-2 the bullet bill glitch and an extremely good 8-4 nobody knew if this goal was even realistic since getting even fast 4-2 or the bellow glitch alone was incredibly difficult so getting them both in a run would be absurd but in december 2015 andrew g proved that it could be done when he became the first person to get them both in a run [Music] yes yes yes come on after getting it that run was on the best pace that any run had ever been on before andrew was visibly uncomfortable oh my gosh he ended up getting the wall jump and the 8-4 wrong warp oh my gosh but a slow water section ended up preventing the record no no no no no [Music] the run still ended up being a pb for him 457.993 18 months after he gave up on getting a 457 andrew g achieved two amazing tasks in the same run proved that a run with fast 4-2 and bullet bill glitch was possible and he got his own 457 a month later darby was able to put a decent 8-4 at the end of a run that had both fast 4-2 and the bullet bill glitch and took the record down another 2 tenths of a second boom that's it but the last level had a few small mistakes that he knew he could fix and once he did a couple of months later [Music] oh my gosh [Music] he claimed himself that he had reached his goal and that it was as far as he was going to push the game after all there were no more known frame rules that could be saved anywhere by a human and the 8-4 in the run was incredibly good he did manage to accidentally beat the record by one more frame while hardly even trying a month or two later but it really seemed like that was the end for super mario bros but the category was dead but if there's one thing that people should have learned by this point it's that when people call super mario bros dead it never really is people once again began to examine the run deeply and look for anywhere where an improvement could be found the ants are laid in a trick that was considered task only at the time the flagpole glitch by getting lucky with your positioning jumping on the perfect frame and then by doing a series of incredibly difficult inputs it's possible to clip into the bottom block below the flagpole and skip the animation of the flag being lowered think of the bullet bill glitch except that it has no bullet bill but it only saves you one framework instead of two for years this trick seemed to be impossible to pull off by a human but thanks to some research about mario speedrunner mav6771 a setup was found that was just barely humanly possible and in august of 2016 darby and was able to pull it off in 1-1 and save a frame rule in the process 3-5 seconds [Music] well we're gonna find out right now we're gonna find out right now if he was able to do that in a run then get fast forward ash to and then get bullet bill butch play everything else perfectly and he would be potentially able to get a 456 but unfortunately success rate at getting the flagpole glitch was just too low for it to be viable so it was put on hold for a while then sock folder came onto the scene thanks to his work with tasking the game he was able to solve the most difficult part of the flagpole glitch getting on the right sub-pixel which is positioned smaller than a pixel that you are normally unable to control you need to be positioned on the correct sub pixel for the flagpole glitch to even work thanks to stock folders work though you found a series of inputs that you could take to ensure that your sub pixel is correct from there it's just getting those inputs jumping at the right time and clipping into the block this trick could be done on 1-1 4-1 and 8-3 to save time although the manipulation needed to set up the 8-3 flagpole glitch was pretty difficult 1-2 and 4-2 didn't have flagpoles to gain another framework 8-1 you would need more frames than the flagpole glitch saves you and 8-2 already has the bullet bill glitch which saves more time than the flagpole glitch so the flagpole glitch is never used on those levels both derby and cosmic e12 incorporated this glitch into their runs cosmic decided to replace fast 4-2 with the flagpole glitch in 1-1 and derby and decided to do the same but also do an additional flagpole glitch in 4-1 cosmic was the first one to find success he was able to tie darby's world record [Music] and then lower it by three frames just a few days later [Music] i don't know i don't know what it was i think it's 0.19 [Music] but because darby and was going for an extra flagpole glitch in 4-1 he had the advantage over cosmic he's able to take the record back from him and recorded the first 456 a time long considered to be absolutely impossible three days after cosmic took it from him [Music] that was it that was it that was it and as of january 2017 that's where the record for this iconic game stands over the course of 12 years the time came down from 510 to 456. each time players set a new limit on what they thought the best time could be first it was 505 and then andrew g beat that by 5 seconds then people thought that there would never be a sub 5 but androgyny beat that one as well then people thought that a 457 would ever happen but blobler pulled that one off then people said you couldn't get fast 4-2 and the bullet bill glitch in a run andrew jeeve proved them all wrong once again then people said at 456 is impossible but sock folder found the flagpole glitch setup darby and got a 456 now people are saying that a 455 is theoretically possible if you got the flagpole glitch in 1-1 4-1 and 8-3 if he got fast 4-2 and the bullet bill glitch on top of an 8-4 that has never even been done at the end of a run the point is even for a game as famous as super mario bros where it seemed like every trick possible is figured out you can never say with absolute confidence that a record won't be improved if you do there's always going to be somebody to prove me wrong thanks for watching everyone i'll see you next time [Music] you
