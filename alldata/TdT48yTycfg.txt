summoning salt merchandise is now available on teespring check out the storefront right below the video enjoy [Music] one of the fastest growing speed runs of the last few years is new super mario bros wii close to a thousand runs are on the leaderboard a mark that not many games have reached naturally competition at the top level is impressive because not many people can call themselves a world record holder a world record demands near perfection honing in skills that come after thousands of hours of gameplay few people have gotten to that level but those who have have etched their place in speedrunning history this is the world record history of new super mario bros wii [Music] [Music] let's start up here at the beginning new super mario bros wii was released on november 12 2009 normally it takes months or even years before a speed running scene develops around the game for new super mario bros wii it took four days people nearly instantly gathered in the speed demos archive forums to route the game for a speed run in the following weeks times of 45 minutes and 35 minutes were claimed by mwl and chrono rocks respectively although neither have video proof for the next several months runner uc pro would both route the game and complete speed runs and in may 2010 he claimed the 2605 but once again he didn't record it to get to the first recorded run we have to jump to may 2011 when ryker z uploaded this run a time of 26 minutes and 56 seconds riker z started in world 1. level 1 1 is quite straightforward where you want to run and jump through to get to the end as fast as possible however there are subtle optimizations you can make sliding down the hills gives you a slight boost of speed and running through the checkpoint is the fastest way to power up riker z also picked up the propeller mushroom for later in one two he tilted the wii remote to create downward slopes he could quickly run down and picked up a star midway through which increases your running speed in 1-3 ryker z used the propeller mushroom to fly up and access the secret exit which unlocked the cannon to take him to world 5. in 5-1 he had to deal with the water in the latter half and he simply fell in and swam as quickly as he could it slowed him down by several seconds after 5-1 you're forced to run into the piranha plant on the overworld map where riker z collected the 8 toad balloons albeit with a bit of a slowdown you then have a choice of either playing 5-2 or 5-3 and riker z picked 5-2 it's a pretty straightforward stage where you bounce on top of wigglers and run through the rest next was the world 5 fortress a vertical stage where having the propeller suit helps immensely reikersi was able to propel her up from platform the platform then defeated iggy with three jumps on his head the next stage was 5-4 this stage is intended to be an auto scroller where you ride on this raft while enemies rain down from these platforms above it's designed to be long and slow not ideal conditions for a speedrun so instead ryker z decided to implement the first game breaking trick of the run [Music] this was first posted by uc pro just two weeks after the game came out and takes some practice to get right but thanks to the propeller suit and navigating and jumping at the correct times it's possible to skip the entire stage by jumping on the platforms and blocks ryker z did so beautifully making a few brief hesitations but still flying through after 5'4 came the world 5 ghost house where ryker z took the secret exit once again to unlock another cannon this time taking him to world 8. the fastest path through world 8 consists of 5 levels 8182 87 the airship and finally bowser's castle in 8 1 ryker z had to deal with randomly falling meteors and he got hit twice he powered back up only to intentionally take damage again later on to boost through some lava in 8-2 ryker-z once again took the secret exit to unlock 8-7 a hidden level that bypasses most of world 8. 8-7 itself is a long stage consisting of jumping from spine coaster to spine coaster world 8's airship isn't an auto scroller like in previous games instead ryker z had to run through and traverse it as quickly as possible he picked up the propeller shroom again to jump across big gaps instead of having to wait and slowly bring the platforms down the bowser junior fight was simple hitting him with three bombs that he dropped and finally there was bowser's castle reicherzee used the propeller suit quite a bit to navigate at the start which isn't always the fastest the last part of the run is the escape where you have to guide bowser's heat seeking fireballs to destroy the path in front of you then navigate through an obstacle course to the finish in all riker z finished after 26 minutes and 56 seconds it was a good starting point there were some obvious slowdowns that could be cleaned up but no huge mistakes or deaths and the video quickly went viral on youtube over the next several months ryker z would continue running the game to push his time lower at the end of 2011 he posted his first new time a 2549 this run actually saved time over the 2656 in every single stage most of his strategies were the same but were better executed in 5-1 for instance he dealt with the water much better jumping out earlier and just barely being able to make it to the end one of the biggest time saves was in 8-1 where he managed to avoid getting hit by the meteors and didn't have to power back up but the best improvement was in bowser's castle he guided the fireballs much better in the escape using nine fireballs to clear the path instead of 18 in his old record in 2012 riker z would get two more records a 25 31 and a 25 27 these runs both optimized existing strategies and utilized new ones in the escape ryker z was able to use just seven fireballs to clear the path ahead the fewest ever achieved in 8-2 he picked up a star to get additional speed instead of damage boosting as big mario and in world 5 he chose to play 5-3 instead of 5-2 it was a more difficult stage but a slightly faster one if performed optimally reiker z had left his mark on new super mario bros wii speed running four world records in a year and a half he stopped running the game but then something very interesting happened despite years going by and many new runners emerging reicherz's world record remained unbroken the leaderboard grew and players got better but ryker z's years old effort was too much to top finally in 2016 someone broke through his name was green uprooter and he beat riker z by one second but unfortunately he didn't record it green uprooter had recorded competitive times before this run and is a trusted community member so his 2526 is taken at face value but it can't be viewed today that left the world record in an awkward place it had taken three and a half years to shave one unrecorded second off the record now there was no telling when it would be broken again but in early 2016 a new runner was climbing up the leaderboards quickly it became inevitable that he was going to be the next record holder in april 2016 he officially did it closing out a 25-23 to beat green uprooter by three seconds but this guy wasn't just any world record holder he had reached the top and he intended to stay there for a long time his name was ochguard ottgard had been around the speedrunning block before achieving top times in mega man x3 crash tag team racing and many other games it makes sense that he was quickly able to get the record in new super mario bros wii but what nobody could have expected is that the very next day he did it again a 25-22 and the next day another record a 25-19 otchguard had set three world records in three days he was more consistent than any player who would come before him meaning he hit tricks more often and made fewer mistakes a big place he saved time was in the escape navigating through the platforms quicker and hesitating less and overall he was able to execute most tricks more cleanly shaving fractions of a second off in several stages after these three records ochsguard took a break from the game nobody came close to challenging him with the closest active runner still being 16 seconds away his skill level was far ahead of the rest so he didn't really need to keep defending the record but he came back in august anyway and immediately got a 5 second world record oshkard's 25-14 was his smoothest run yet he cleaned up a small mistake in 5-3 from his last run doing a small jump to be able to run under the blocks while on the log his 5-4 execution was also smoother as he didn't pound the blocks he landed on and was able to continue moving and in 8 1 he didn't slow down as much while propellering over the lava these all added up to a few seconds of time save and he didn't lose any significant time anywhere else with a 25-14 ochgard had pulled way ahead 12 seconds ahead of second place and 21 seconds ahead of any active runner he had set a total of four records and barring any new developments it seemed like nobody else had a real shot of catching him but still probably ottgard's most unlikely feat was the three-day streak of records he had back in april even setting a record on back to back days is extremely rare so extending that streak to 3 days it practically never happens not only did it show complete dominance of a category but it showed a level of consistency that was unrivaled it was undoubtedly a once-in-a-lifetime accomplishment for ochgard yes from august 16th through the 18th octar once again set three world records in a row doing this once was staggeringly unlikely but in all my years of research i've never heard of someone doing it twice all three records were 25 12s but each one was slightly lower than the last the time saves were minimal but impressive in their own right the first record had a particularly clean bowser's castle the second cleaned up a mistake in 5-3 and the final shaved a fraction of a second on the rolling hills in 8-2 but still these three records weren't good enough for ottgard two weeks later he'd lower it again with a 2510 his eighth world record ochguard was quickly approaching a barrier a sub 25 minute run he was 10 seconds away did he have that much time left to save well there were still fractions of a second he could get from cleaner movement throughout the stages in terms of stuff he'd gotten in a run before all that time save would put him at 2505 still five seconds away but there was one other trick he could go for it would be the hardest trick in the run by far but it would get him to sub 25. this is 5 5 6. in the second half of the world five fortress the spiked walls move back and forth on a cycle throughout the entire level normally with fast movement you make it to the top and then have to wait a few seconds for the spikes to finish their cycle so you can get to the door typically you enter the door with 546 left on the timer however with unbelievably fast movement it's possible to barely reach the top a cycle early you can just fit in before the spikes move and block your path and you wind up reaching the door at five five six this was originally thought to be tool assisted only as the precision involved is truly incredible your moves have to be just right where the instant you land you have to be starting your next jump up but in late august 2016 ottgard became the first human to pull off 556. he just barely squeezed in before the gap closed but with this he proved that it was a human viable trick it saves seven and a half seconds since the in-game timer moves a bit quicker than a real second which means that when combined with the stages of 2505 a sub 25 was indeed technically possible so the goal was now in sight with nobody else close to his skill level ochgard was the only one with any chance to do it it was still a long shot goal but at least there was a narrow path to sub 25 he would have to shave time off wherever he could then nail 556 to get the bulk of the time save if he could pull all that off it would be an essentially unbeatable speed run for the rest of 2016 oshgar played more than he ever had before and over the next few months this is what happened [Music] oh my god you get it you did yes [Music] [Applause] after weeks of trying it had happened the legendary unimaginable sub 25 this was very close to being a perfect speedrun at the end of a run that had gotten 5-5-6 that was 5 seconds ahead of the record otchgaard was able to get a gold split on bowser's castle it was the fastest he had ever completed the last stage in a run his movement was impeccable and he saved all the time he could ochard could finally celebrate and take it easy he had gotten his ultimate run and there was no need to bother defending it and so he didn't for the rest of 2016 and throughout 2017 nobody was really doing world record attempts in new super mario bros wii the community considered och guard's time to be essentially unbeatable and it made sense why first you'd have to get 556 which fellow top runner gex01 described as a one in 50 trick then you'd have to find a way to save time in one of the other stages och guard did not leave much room for this and finally you'd have to match his incredible bowser's castle split which ended with a 5-11 on the in-game timer as 2017 progressed people did improve their times but nobody was close to 24-58 entering 2018 it really did seem as though octoguard had achieved an unbeatable world record otchgaard himself felt that maybe on the outer limit a 2455 would be possible by doing quicker wall kicks in 5-4 doing spins later into jumps in the airship so mario moved faster for longer and other small optimizations like those he stopped short of calling his record unbeatable but it's clear that neither he nor anybody else in the community felt there was much wiggle room and then in april 2018 this happened [Music] 24 45 how on earth was that possible well certainly this run pulled out all the stops like 5 5 6 right no this run didn't have so it lost a little over seven seconds well certainly this time was achieved by an established runner like otcard right no it was from a new runner named fade vanity alright so what happened here well fade vanity was a runner who quickly rose up the leaderboards in early 2018 until he had a low 25. he performed the 2445 on april 13 2018 and other than missing 556 the run was incredibly smooth from start to finish 8-2 in particular was fantastic finishing with a nearly unheard of 4-24 on the in-game timer but that's not why this run was the record this run had a massive time save because of a huge new trick in the airship and that trick is called bombless [Music] at the end of the world 8 airship you have to fight bowser jr the intended way to fight him is to wait for him to drop a bomb then ground pound to send it back up to hit him do that three times and bowser jr is defeated for years that's how players fought him in runs however in august 2017 runner i love smb found that in the world six airship it was possible to defeat bowser jr by jumping on him three times instead of using the intended clown cars runners then theorized that this could apply in the world 8 airship fight as well which is what you do in an any percent run however the gap between bowser jr and the top of the screen is smaller than mario's hitbox so despite players trying nobody could fit in the gap to hit bowser jr on the head for a few months that was the end of it but in january 2018 former world record holder green uprooter figured it out the key was bowser jr's movement he not only moves horizontally but also vertically in a sinusoidal pattern oscillating from a low point to a high point so if you fly up to him then perform a ground pound in a one to two frame window when bowser jr is at the lowest point in his oscillation mario's hitbox briefly shrinks just enough to fit in the gap so you can hit bowser jr if you're able to pull this off it saves 13 seconds an incredible amount of time for a run like this the problem is it's really difficult the only way to practice it was to load a file with propeller shrooms then play the second half of the stage over and over when green uprooter first discovered it in january 2018 it was thought to be an related trick because nobody could hit it with any consistency in fact it took two more months before somebody hid it in a run when gixx got it in march doing bomb lists saves up to 13 seconds but doing double bomb lifts where you skip two of the three bombs saves up to 20. triple bombless would actually lose time since simply ground pounding the other bomb is faster but despite double wamless being theoretically known to be possible nobody had ever performed it even in practice you'd have to hit the most precise trick in the game twice in a row it just wasn't realistic so that's what made it even more crazy when fade vanity got the world's first ever double bomb list and finished the run as his 2445 world record [Music] i did it [Music] i did it i did i did i did it oh my [ __ ] god i did it sadly fade vanity quit speed running in 2021 and deleted all videos of his runs so many of his world records are lost today including his 24-45 a small amount of footage from this run and others were preserved in conor 01's record history video so we can see glimpses of what he did but when he set this record in april 2018 the community was absolutely shocked at his accomplishment and still there was clearly more time to save he didn't get five five six so a run in the 2430s and possibly lower was possible fade vanity was the new top runner of new super mario bros wii and while little footage remains of what he did over the next several months his impact and legacy continued to this day with time still left on the table fade vanity committed to attempts and went all out to drive the record down [Music] my god [Music] let's go let's go let's go we [ __ ] did it let's go 3x come on let's go [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] let's take a stroll over to the new super mario bros wii leaderboards you've got a number of runners with a low 25 minute time and a few that had just broken into the 24 minute barrier with the lowest being a 24-56 then you have fade vanity one of the most dominant record holders in all of speedrunning he had set five records now and when combining 556 double bombless and tight execution all around he managed to take it under 24 30. fade took a break after this and his record really didn't seem to be in jeopardy a few months went by and while runners like the coding boy and dca did creep into the 2440s there was still a lot of separation it had turned into a battle for second place which changed hands a few times in late 2019 but nobody had a chance of catching fade vanity nobody had his consistency or skill as for fade himself he initially didn't have much of a need to continue playing the category but by early 2020 new strategies were found once again the days of huge time saves seem to be in the past but minor strategies like this would be crucial in finding time to save over the record they both came in world 8 and were both found by astix in 8 1 normally you have to significantly slow down after propellering over this lava however by picking up and carrying a shell you can throw it and end mario's spin early meaning you slow down much less in 8-2 the rolling hills throughout the stage can destroy your speed however aztecs found that by crouch jumping and releasing the crouch at the top of the jump mario speed is reset back to normal and once again you don't have to slow down as much in total these tricks saved about a second and a half meaning the potential was there for faith to continue lowering the record and on january 9th 2020 that's exactly what he did gas broke the tie broke the tie what tie well the new super mario bros wii leaderboard was going through a transition at this point see whenever the game fades to black it's loading what comes next these loads vary from disk to disk console to console or even within the same disk or console each load might only vary by a few tenths of a second but over the course of a run this can add up to 15 to 20 seconds that means that a player can have a much faster run but fall behind because of loading times outside of their control so the community was transitioning towards subtracting all loads out of the final time this would level the playing field and as a byproduct lower the time of each run by a bit over two minutes fades 2429 converted to a time of 2220 without loads in january 2020 a runner named uvidio completed a run of 2435 with loads that the community thought might have tied fade's run when re-timed without loads hence the comment at the end of fade's run it ended up being just behind it with a 22-23 but when fade got his 24-28 that removed all doubt and fade was securely on top once again in march 2020 timing without loads was made official and the world record was now a 22-19 it's also worth mentioning that in recent months players discovered that the way they originally retimed runs added a couple seconds in certain cases fades 22 19 was originally timed to 22-21 but for this video i'll be using re-timed times for accuracy through the first few months of 2020 the leaderboard was starting to get tight at the top the record remained the same but people like you video were now just seconds away fade vanity had been in the top spot for over two years setting six records and lowering the time by half a minute in the process he was the third long-lasting record holder in the game's history mirroring the domination that ryker z and ochgaard once had but other players were starting to catch up everyone's record reign needs to end someday and with increased pressure at the top of the leaderboard it seemed inevitable that a breakthrough was coming and on july 2nd that breakthrough finally came this is pidgey pidgey was early on a clear candidate to take the record he was a former world record holder in new super mario bros on the ds so making the switch to the wii version came naturally to him after running the game for just a few months pidgey was within seconds of fade vanity's time and on july 2nd 2020 he got a 22 19.4 just barely ahead of fade for a new world record new strategies in world 5 were a key for this run there was an even easier method for getting 556 developed by tutti polo by doing an additional wall kick here you're set up to more easily make it to the second wall kick and have a much better chance at getting the fast cycle and in 5 3 monster found a trick nicknamed the weird shell strat if you're fast enough you arrive at this koopa right after he stops to dance and can then pick him up to kill the bramble and save half a second there's also randomness on the overworld maps the world one goomba moves three times clockwise meaning there's one direction he never moves if this one direction is up you save 35 frames since the goomba's up animation takes the longest on the other hand if that one direction is down you lose that time since down is his shortest animation world 5 has similar randomness with the piranha plant but it's less understood than the goomba these two spots have about a second of time variance combined which is entirely out of the player's control so in july 2020 this was the state of the new super mario bros wii leader board in first place you had pidgey the newcomer who clearly had enormous potential and just a half second behind him you had fade vanity the veteran who had proven himself time and time again so who was better well just four days later pidgey would set his second world record a slightly lower 22-19 he saved time by successfully getting the shell boost in 8-1 but lost a bit in bowser's castle two records in a row from pidgey it seemed he might be there to stay but just two weeks later fade vanity was back fade got a 22-18 marking the first time in the game's history that someone reclaimed the record after losing it the time save mostly came from optimizing movement and fade was back on top six days later he was dethroned a 22-16 from pidgey a run that matched the fastest he had ever performed bowser's castle before in october a 22-15 from pidgey a month later a lower 22-15 from fade vanity two weeks later a new record from pidgey that was seven world records in the last five months one new option they had was bombfall in 5-4 this stage had many small movement optimizations over the years but bombfall was the biggest one yakker tracker found that if you precisely jump off the first bomb spin at the right time to bounce off the second bomb then do a blind twirl and bounce off the third bomb it's possible to make it to the end of the stage without hesitating it saves two seconds but is incredibly difficult and most players didn't choose to implement it a few months later pidgey would strike again with a remarkable 22-13 but in may probably the most bizarre moment in the game's history took place a runner named skippy had been a world record contender for months but perpetually remained a few seconds behind the top spot his skill level was right there but stringing everything together for a world record run is incredibly challenging on may 2nd skippy got a run off to a good start essentially remaining tied with pidgey's record through world 5. however he started bleeding time in world 8 with a worse transition into the pipe in 8-2 and some sloppy movement in the airship combined these lost him a couple seconds so despite matching pidgey's bowser's castle a new record was out of the question still after the run he subtracted the loads and he could see how much he missed the record by [Music] he hadn't missed the record skippy had just gotten a 2213.167 a new world record by half a second this did not make sense he was tied going into world 8 then lost some time and finished the run he didn't gain that time back anywhere it was still a very well executed run but this should not have been world record yet somehow the time was faster than pidgey's run what happened well the community looked into it runner curran joseph made a video removing all gameplay from skippy's run leaving just the overworld screens and cutscenes he then compared this video to pidgey's non-gameplay sections everything was roughly in sync through worlds one and five but then they arrived at the cut scene after stage 8-7 there it was skippy's cut scene was almost 2 seconds faster curran quickly figured out why you have the choice of playing new super mario bros wii in a 4x3 or 16x9 aspect ratio skippy played on a crt tv so he selected the 4x3 mode the game runs identically in each mode for an any percent run except during the cutscene after 8 7. in 4x3 black bars are added to the top and bottom of the screen the game still loads these regions despite them not appearing visible so the airship above stage 8 7 loads when it's off screen and the camera stops moving about two seconds sooner despite this seeming like an obvious find players didn't discover this before skippy's run because nearly all runners played on a flat screen in 16x9 mode in fact only one prior record holder played in four by three ryker z way back in 2011 and 2012 the time save wasn't known about back then so with it being unearthed nearly a decade later there were suddenly two more seconds on the table so now at the top of the leaderboard you had three real record contenders skippy was the first obvious one he was the current record holder and while he may have benefited from the faster cut scene he was still an incredibly talented runner the second contender was pidgey all he had done was set the record six times in the past and he was still competing to lower it but the third contender was someone i haven't mentioned yet someone who had snuck up to the top with a 22-15 just two seconds behind the record this is billy joe 66 billy began to ascend up the leaderboards in late 2020 by the end of the year he was in the top ten and a month later he was a bonafide record contender he'd had a tragic run in february that hit bombfall in 5'4 and was about 3 seconds ahead of the record into bowser's castle unfortunately he misguided a fireball and had to use an extra one and upon re-timing the run he missed world record by half a second but billy didn't give up there he did thousands of attempts and partially thanks to the boost given by playing on 4x3 he found himself on world record pace with regularity and a few weeks after skippy's record billy was on another run deep he lost a bit of time in the second half of world 5 but cleaned up the mistakes that skippy had made in world 8. with about half a second lead he entered bowser's castle and tried to close it out for good billy's run finished at 22 12.367 a world record by just under a second he was now the seventh record holder in the game's history and he had earned it this was his 59th run to the airship since his last major personal best he had finally been able to chain together double bombless and a clean bowser's castle and the result was a world record once again the game was approaching a barrier with all time saves being utilized a time under 2210 was starting to seem feasible but what time was left to save well most of it was in world 5. cleaner movement would save a second in 5-4 and bomb full would save a couple more there were also minor improvements to be made in the fortress and ghost house those time saves would add up to a run just under 22-10 but there was work to do to get to that point the record was still about 2.4 seconds away from a sub 2210 as time goes on most speedruns see smaller and smaller improvements to their records and new super mario bros wii was no exception the last several records had all been improvements by a second or half a second or even less than that to get an improvement of 2.4 seconds you have to go 11 records back in time to fade vanities 24-29 the point is it was gonna take a while to get the record under 2210 multiple improvements would have to be made and players would have to grind hundreds or thousands of attempts an incredible run was on the horizon but it would take time to get it there and then in one attempt pidgey decided to lay waste to it all [Music] he saved the time in world 5 hitting everything but bomb full he got the shell boost in 8-1 and the crouch jumps in 8 2. after hitting double bombless it became all the more real this was easily world record pace but was it sub 22 10 pace maybe it was right on the border between 2209 and 2210 it was coming down to the wire pidgey just had to finish the escape and the sub 2210 could be his nice [Music] new super mario bros wii has motion controls for certain actions if you shake the wii remote with a propeller suit you fly into the air pidgey had made it to the end then put down his controller to hit the split button but he did it a fraction of a second too soon and it registered as a spin at first the community wasn't sure if this would still be a world record they couldn't tell until they removed the loads and retimed it and when they did pidgey found out that he had missed the world record by two frames it goes without saying how hard it is to come back for moments like this when you're so close and lose your ultimate goal to something as trivial as motion controls and it's exceptionally hard to accept when you have competitors like pidgey did billy still had the world record and skippy was just one second behind he had done nearly 4 000 attempts ran the game for over two years and had never had a pace this good this deep into the run and sadly there was no telling when he'd get there again eleven days later pidgey had pulled a dave steve it took him just a week and a half to get back on the exact same pace and i mean the exact same pace it was almost an identical run into bowser's castle he'd had a nearly flawless world five other than skipping bombfall and hit the same tricks in world viii he nailed double wamless and just like that pidgey had given himself another chance once again he had to get through the escape [Music] redemption for pidgey his miss from 11 days ago could have haunted him for months but instead in one straight shot pidgeot jumped all the way to sub 2210 it was a landmark world record and as the community celebrated it was pretty clear that this one was gonna stand for a while there were still other competitors at the top but pidgey had gotten nearly everything you could get in the speed run of the game it was too tall of an order and so throughout the rest of 2021 and into 2022 pidgey's 2209 remained alone at the top in early 2022 competition continued to increase new names appeared in the top 10 and pressure was starting to mount but pidgey's records still remained strong the fact that he had gotten a 2209 when nobody else could get below a high 22-11 was indicative of his skill level even after months of attempts from the world's best runners no one was beating it the simple fact was without getting bomb full in 5-4 pidgey's record would be next to impossible to beat and nobody was up to the task of getting it in a fast enough run until billy came back on march 26 2022 billy had a fairly clean run into world 5. he hit bombfall in 5-4 gaining a couple of seconds over the record and instantly making his run much more serious he then gained more time in the ghost house via the meme jump through the boot ring unfortunately he lost time in both 8-7 and the airship so despite making it through double bombless he was about even with the record into bowser's castle he'd need an unbelievable last stage for this to have a shot at the record and all billy did was proceed to have the best bowser's castle ever performed in a record run and he beat pidgey by less than two tenths of a second this run is the current world record of new super mario bros wii sub 22 might seem close but right now it's quite unrealistic a theoretical god run could clock in a few seconds above 22 minutes but it's hard to see a path to a record below that at the moment that being said i have little doubt it will one day come eventually we'll hear of a 21 minute any percent run but that
