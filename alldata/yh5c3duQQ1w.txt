[Music] I'm here in New York at the Brooklyn Basketball 
Academy because today we'll be looking at the math   of basketball answering such questions 
as are you all ready for this   what copyright and we'll find a way 
around that y'all ready for maths if you're unfamiliar with the game in basketball 
you typically get two points if you get the ball   in the basket but if you shoot from outside 
the three-point line which is a long way out   you get three points a fifty percent increase 
and I have the general impression that over the   last decade or so three-point shots have become 
more prevalent not just regular threes from the   line some deep three-point shots so my first 
basketball stats question is is that an actual   significant change in the sport specifically 
the NBA or is it just a rough impression I've   got but it's not actually a fundamental change 
in how the game is played and if it is my second   question is is there a strategic reason for 
why that happened and if that's also true my   final question why didn't this happen earlier 
why did this change only happen in the 2010s   to enter these math ball questions I'm joined by 
my friend Tim who is currently in Residence at the   Museum of mathematics which is why you're in New 
York and why we're doing this video you normally   work at I guess you still do at Davidson College 
which is in North Carolina so what do you do at   Davidson well I'm a math professor I teach 
math and computer science and I also lead a   sports analytics group that started with three 
students and became 100. you've got a hundred   students working on sports stats and analytics 
and yeah that's so good and you've advised the   USA olympic team yeah it's an MBA teams yes can 
you say what NBA teams or is that uh yeah we're   not really supposed to say that but also the 
league teams what was that awesome also the   league office just MBA League office yeah the 
zeroth team and the one major question I had was   to my opinion because I watched him play 
basketball in the 90s and I have not I have my   abilities have gone downhill since then but I've 
continued watching the NBA and to my mind the game   I'm the first person to say this obviously has 
moved out yes and now three pointers are almost   non-stop so what we thought we would do is first 
of all have a look at the statistics like is my   impression watching the NBA correct and so you 
downloaded every single shot taken in the NBA   between the 1997 season and the 2022 season yeah 
yeah so I've got literally every shot with the XY   coordinates of where it is on the court so if the 
shots have been drifting out we should be able to   see that we just need a really nice way to plot 
them like a very fun interactive math 3D plotting   so anyway um Grant grunt if I got some data 
can you plot it for me excellent we'll do that Grant Sanderson who you might know from 
3blue1brown very kindly took all of Tim's   data and plotted it onto a 3D representation 
of a basketball court and you can see as time   progresses the shots seem to move around in terms 
of where they're most frequent but to have more   of an Insight you know what let's rewind back to 
some key years so if you go back to let's say the   year 2000 in 2000 you have these two spikes big 
clumps of shots on the Baseline on either side of   the basket and then you kind of got this Forest of 
other shots from the top of the keyway out to the   three-point line if you fast forward now until 
2010 those clumps of shots from the Baseline   have moved out to the three-point line there's 
suddenly way more shots happening out here but   you still got a pretty similar Forester shots on 
the top of the keyway however by 2020 we've now   got almost no shots happening on the Baseline 
which used to be an incredibly popular shot   two decades earlier loads from the three-point 
line out here and then run the front look at   this Great Wall of three-point shots that is just 
solidified on the outside of the three-point line   and inside there's this empty Tundra a desert a 
almost complete void with no shots happening from   the top of the keyway just inside the three-point 
line where these mid-range shots used to be much   more prevalent so we can see statistically modern 
NBA players are taking way more three-point shots   than their predecessors from two decades earlier 
to find out why we now did an experiment run by   Noel and Liz who were math fellows at the Museum 
of mathematics and they set up markers at four   foot nine 9 14 18 20 and 23.75 feet corresponding 
to various standard distances on a basketball   court including the high school college and NBA 
three-point distances and I took 10 shots from   all of them and we kept track of my data which 
looked like this so you can see close to the rim   I'm getting well sixty percent fifty percent it's 
not great I'm out of practice that then drops off   dramatically before an unusual little uptick 
which to be fair is Two Shots instead of one   shot so that could be a statistical variation 
it could be what residual muscle memory I have   left from my youth making shots at the specific 
three-point distances who knows the point is I   was more accurate up close and then I actually 
dropped off dramatically as I got further out   and to make sure that's not just me everyone 
then had a go everyone took 10 shots from each   of those six markers including back my co-host of 
the A Problem Squared podcast and once all six of   us had had 60 shots each this is the final plot 
you can see very similar to my shots you're up   sixty percent fifty percent accuracy for the close 
shots once you get up to the three-point line that   drops off dramatically although I suspect for 
NBA players they're a little bit more accurate should they take shots from the three-point 
line I'm gonna [ __ ] with x's and y's running   the numbers as the coach nuts so I thought I'd 
work it out I had to be just over four and a   half million shots taken over 24 years of the 
NBA that Tim had given me and here you can see   them all I've plotted each year individually to 
start with but the issue with that is because I'm   running to the nearest inch you get a lot of like 
these one-off like this is a single shot taken in   that season that went in but because I'm running 
to the nearest inch there was no other shots that   season in that category but if I was going to 
do this on a year by year basis I would use   bigger bins like bigger categories but I know 
I'm gonna take all of the years all the way up   to the 21 22 season and combine them and that 
gives us a much nicer plot we've lost all that   variability here it's collapsed into a nice neat 
line once you get further out though we're back   in the same situation there weren't just that 
many shots taken this far out and you can see   there's a lot of times there's a single shot taken 
at that distance that missed hence all these zero   points down here so I'm actually going to do is I 
think the useful data stops about here and that's   roughly where the half court line is so I'm going 
to remove all the shots which are further out then   roughly the distance of half court which just um 
gives us this wonderful plot we can break it down   to three regions you've obviously got the really 
close shots up here I mean this is people dunking   at almost 90 percent you've got you know pretty 
much at The Rim this is roughly uh 75 chance of   these going in there's a weird spot down here I 
think that shots that are just like so close it's   awkward but this is kind of the main event and 
this tapers off uh down to about here which is   approximately 48 inches from the ring or four 
foot and just coincidentally that's where the   restricted zone is in the MBA if it's an NBA game 
or in fact a lot of basketball this line here is   exactly four feet from the center of the ring and 
in this region a defensive player can't draw an   offensive foul from someone coming in trying to 
score and it seems when you're this close you're   way more likely to score I worked out it's pretty 
much exactly you lose one percentage point of   accuracy for each inch you are further away from 
The Ring until you get down to here which is like   the outside of the restricted area then after that 
it flattens out it goes real flat for a long time   although one thing I want to point out well I've 
got the picture up here is the backboard there you   can see is like not up against the Baseline it's 
further in it's like hereish if I cut to a diagram   of the Court you can see the backboard is a little 
way in it's four foot in from the Baseline then   there's like a six inch gap between the backboard 
and the ring and then the ring is 18 inches in   diameter and so actually the center of the ring 
is five foot three inches in from the Baseline   so actually some of these shots here were taken 
from behind the backboard back behind the ring   so I thought you know what I'm going to change the 
data so any shot where your y coordinate which is   coming out this way is negative so it's behind 
the ring I'm going to flip the distance to be   negative and this is what the plot looked like 
when I did that I'm like wait a minute there's   there's way more over here so if we rescale 
that you can see here's our ring at zero inches   here's all the positive shots from the front side 
of the court and then this is behind the ring so   you have the kind of symmetric drop off here but 
it gets way worse these are shots from like behind   the backboard really awkward shots and then this 
blur these are shots kind of coming out along the   Baseline here and they're spread out again because 
we haven't got enough shots in each category to   get a good average like we do on the front so 
I was like you know what it's kind of fun to   see these but I I don't think there's much we can 
learn from them other than I quite like the fact   we've taken them out of this data it makes this 
data a bit neater and just to tidy things up I'm   going to go back like to a negative restricted 
Zone distance and Lop off all the other ones   but these are just here to remind us that we have 
taken the negative shots out of our positive data   and to finish our tour you have what I call here 
the the big flat this is at 39.6 accuracy that's   everything from the basket all the way out to 
the three-point line anything in here it seems   to be distance and variant it doesn't matter where 
you're shooting from it's roughly 40 Precision in   fact in recent years this has gone up slightly so 
if you just take the most recent five years this   line is at 40.8 accuracy but over 24 years it's 
39.6 accuracy and the three-point line is about   here and then you're actually starts to drop off 
after that but we're not here about accuracy we   hear about points so first of all I'm going 
to rescale this down so we've now instead of   going from zero to one we go zero to one then all 
the way up to two which means as well as plotting   accuracy we can also add in points if you put the 
points on exactly the same diagram you get this   curve so up until the three-point line it's just 
this one doubled because you get two points when   all of these go in so that's the average number 
of points you're getting which means the big flat   here is around about eight points per shot and 
then here you've got the three point line and   this is a slope it's not an Abrupt change because 
the three-point line is not a set distance away   from the basket so from The Ring straight down 
here that's only 22 feet away but then as you   go this way it gets longer and longer and longer 
and longer until here that's 23.75 feet and so   you've actually got this kind of a transition in 
the distance and I unsplit them out this is just   the distance and the average number of points from 
that distance because I could pull the points out   separate from the data I wasn't using the distance 
to determine what kind of shot it was that's   labeled independently in the data and you get this 
huge jump up here and then you get basically the   same plot from here this is after all the shots 
from here are after the three-point line and so   this is just this plot but now multiplied by three 
as opposed to this plot over here multiplied by   two and the transitional zone so what can we 
learn from this well the first thing I did was   I took all the shots which are one foot past the 
3 every point line that is maximum extent and for   that single one foot region here the average 
points per shot is 1.12 and you're like wow   that's that's amazing 1.12 points per shot if you 
only get the same value over here you're going to   be 26 inches away from the ring there's two foot 
two inches before you're averaging 1.12 points   per shot on average so it turns out taking three 
point shots gets you the same points on average   as being about two foot away from The Ring like 
that's absolutely incredible this is way higher   than I expected it to be and then there's drop off 
this drops off a lot slower than I expected and   yes that's a spread out because there are fewer 
attempted points per inch I probably should use   bigger categories out here but I can still draw 
a line from this and I worked out when this dips   below the big flat and it's at seven foot past 
the three-point line you need to be seven foot   out how about that in context here we've got the 
three-point line here we've got the middle of the   court and seven feet out is about here it's 
thirty percent of the way out to the middle   of the court so shots from out here I mean these 
folks are all about seven foot tall if you have   a single like metric basketball player out that 
is where you're going to get the same points on   average shooting as you would anywhere in here 
anywhere outside the restricted Zone if you're   shooting in here you're getting the same points 
on average as shooting all the way I mean these   are some deep threes out here and actually that's 
Steph Curry is kind of a mascot of this change in   basketball who fun fact went to the same College 
where Tim works it all comes together nicely and   Tim remembers when Steph was playing college ball 
there and just how revolutionary his style of play   was of course because it's Steph Curry he just 
nails that shot from all the way out there I mean   the the he's not human it's absolutely ridiculous 
and so what this plot is showing us is why we're   taking so many three-point shots now because the 
average points you're getting all the way out   here I mean for a long way out for the seven feet 
out from the three-point line you're getting more   points on average than if you took a shot anywhere 
inside the paint and just for comparison here's   our plot from earlier our precision and if you 
multiply that by the number of points you get for   each shot you have pretty much exactly the same 
curve I think this is you know identical to the   NBA really I just went for the NBA threes I didn't 
do any of the closer three-point lines so you just   get this tick up at the end so there you are this 
is us as you can see indistinguishable from the   NBA and the moral of the story is why would you 
get 0.8 points per average here if you can step   back a few inches and get 1.1 points so we know 
NBA players are shooting from further out we   know they're doing it because they're getting more 
points on average from those shots the remaining   question is if the NBA introduced a three-point 
line in 1979 why did it take decades until the   2010s before the average shot distance moved out 
in a substantial manner one of the big things   is that there was a presumption that this kind 
of mid-range shot not close and not beyond the   three-point line was not as efficient but people 
were used to shooting in it it was when the shot   data came that they could study it carefully so it 
really was the data that convinced teams that the   mid-range shot was inefficient and it was worth 
training for three point shots I have a question   actually so when when they said oh it looks like 
three pointers or something that's a little bit   more uh higher expected value for the points was 
that based on the existing shot data or were they   saying assuming you train for that and like you 
specifically changed the way that you coach and   you change the way you train we could bump it up 
such that the expected value for threes is bigger   yeah that's an interesting question I think part 
of I'm not quite answering your question but in   terms of the the change in the game is that 
for certain players in the game at that time   it was still very true that they were shooting 
three-pointers well enough that that what we see   today was efficient for them but now the game has 
changed where some of the big players come out and   shoot that which was not true in the 90s when 
some of us played basketball a lot and it's not   just basketball Tim has a huge team of sports 
analytics data people at Davidson College and   they cover an incredible range of sports finding 
useful insights that the coaches can use we do men   and women's basketball men and women's soccer or 
football we do American football swimming Field   Hockey baseball and volleyball a lot of times 
when we were beginning in any sport that we   do we work with the coaches to actually learn 
not only what's coachable in the sport what's   coachable for that coach saying for instance that 
you need a certain three-point percentage for it   to be a efficient for you to shoot from there 
is coachable because you need to practice until   you have that saying for instance your third in 
defense is not coachable because it's just it's   just a stat and it's like okay I don't know what 
to do with that and one of the first questions   if anyone's trying to work with the coach is 
what do you do with numbers what do you wish   you could do with numbers that's just the basic 
question and then you go from there is there a   systematic kind of blind spot that people will 
have before they dig into the data before you're   able to come and help versus after the two blind 
spots for the coaching staff that's usually how   much of their gut they want to go with and so 
you have to be careful not to intrude on what   they want because they may be right with it 20 
of coaches who use their gut do more important   yeah and then one of the biggest things for a 
sports analyst is that you kind of wanted the   data to say what you already think is true about 
the game and so you it actually helps to have very   math-oriented people who don't know Sports very 
well and sports people who may not know the math   very well and people in the middle all part of 
a sports analytics team at least in the group I   work with so you don't have the confirmation 
yes exactly okay that makes sense [Music]   the context seems to sometimes matter like if 
you have stats on Matt's percentage but he's very   rarely given the ball right and it's uh he's only 
given to it in Desperate circumstances whereas   the easy shots are given to the good players 
right does that mess up when you're saying oh   well we looking like Matt's shot percentage is 
like 10 but if he was given more credit like if   the coach had assumed uh you know he's going to 
make more and he's given more of the easy shots   it might like by giving different coaching you're 
going to change what the probabilities are yeah   yeah there's two things with that one is just 
literally sample size so in every single thing   we give coaches we always give the sample size we 
just say how many times it happened right because   you know if you shoot once and make it then 
you know you're amazing because you're 100 the   um the other part that plays into that is is just 
the fact that you really have to be careful with   the numbers in terms of will they hold like if you 
play really well for 10 minutes will you continue   to play well for 20 minutes right and we can't 
predict that all the time so you just but you have   to state that even though most coaches are aware 
of that at least analytic minded ones are some are   but not more again at a gut level than an analytic 
level yeah I guess what I'm sort of getting is   like is there a difference between do you consider 
differences between the statistics like the data   gathered and then the probability like given some 
new assumptions given what you're going to do uh   how do those numbers actually influence what you 
expect moving forward because like once you change   the coaching it changes some underlying aspects 
of how someone's playing and things like that yeah   one I think this answers that one time we had a 
player who had really bad knees and we had this   isn't exactly what you're asking but we were asked 
he can only play for 10 minutes what are the 10   minutes he should play in the game well he hadn't 
played that way the whole season so like we had to   make the best educated guess we could of those 10 
minutes and turned out that we did really well but   there are of course examples where the coaches 
then went okay let's refine those analytics a   little bit yeah so yeah it's those types of 
things but it you work hand in hand with the   coaches and that's what enables good decision 
making to happen now we saw your basketball   progress before it isn't true that your wife 
actually has the highest shooting percentage of   any player on the Chicago Bulls practice Corps yes 
yes she does she has a hundred percent a hundred   percent hundred percent exactly she's better 
than all of them how many shots did you take one that's the important of sample size just before 
we go I'd like to thank Grant from three blue   one brown for coming down playing some basketball 
recording some stats and Grant has just announced   the third summer of math Exposition this is 
a thing that Graham puts on over the summer   where people who are thinking of getting into 
math communication can make a video a blog post   an interactive you know they can make whatever 
they want and it's supportive environment lots   of feedback lots of help and there's prize money 
provided by my good friends at Jane Street so if   you've ever considered doing mass communication 
please do check out the link in the description   below and yeah once again thanks to Grant I'm 
always hugely appreciative when Grant makes   time to come and join me one of my ridiculous 
mathematical Adventures I want to show you two   things yeah one of them is a little special 
something I got for you so first of all I got   custom jerseys made did you get a pie creature 
Jersey well no it's just the pie symbol okay it's   just it's just you know just normal existed before 
the pie mascot so I thought team math this is play   another pie right and this is my one here so I'm 
back there you can see all your customers yeah   yeah so you're number three one three one four 
one and I went as far as I could reliably get   them to print digits fair enough my theory is as 
much as you need to get to the moon yeah exactly there so now I can play I'm clearly you're too 
mad but I still hang on I can't order a shirt   just for me are you this is just what's up man 
are you large or extra large you really get medium   okay here we go no offense taken   I take it I get more Exes in front of my L as 
uh the years going so Grand I guess the real   question is what number you gave from me well 
okay we're just off the bat you also got pie   oh well but it's team pie yeah like the actual 
proper number the reason you got that is because   they could only print One Design so you've 
also got passes so I'm also Burgers it's nice [Laughter] yeah uh well okay I was anticipating 
a little design work but that I'm Josh   team match yeah let's do it y'all ready for maths thank you so much for watching the video and 
Tim is the distinguished visiting Professor   here at the Museum of mathematics where they 
have this fantastic hoop curves exhibit where   we put the ball in it will I've been 
told make a shot every single time foreign strictly speaking anyway if 
you're anywhere in the New   York area make sure you come down and 
check out Mo math it's really good fun eyes on the prize with a large sample that's 
never lies should they take shots from the   three-point line I'm gonna pluck with x's 
and y's running the numbers as the coach   nuts to the stats show what they knew 
in their guts use the distribution is Maps stats fast
