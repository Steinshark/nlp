six months ago Matt Damon told us all that fortune favors the brave in a commercial that appeared to be about sailing flying and rocket ships but was actually about a crypto exchange the implication of course being if you don't buy into crypto in 2022 you're a chicken a coward and you're gonna be crying to your grandkids trying to explain why they can't eat because you didn't listen to the janitor from Goodwill Hunting and this was the beginning of a major spending spree for the crypto exchange called crypto.com they were gonna do things differently while other people bribed celebrities like Jimmy Fallon with pictures of apes crypto.com was going to be smart and judicious about their spending which is why they spent 100 million dollars on this ad comparing going to Mars with buying crypto and they followed It Up by buying the naming rights to the Staples Center for 700 million dollars now I know what you're thinking 800 million dollars that's a lot of money to spend just on ads but fear not they have a great Revenue business plan they're going to make money on trading fees and also on people investing in their coin called Kronos or Crow but of course getting people to go to your website is one thing and getting them to invest in your token is quite another so to make this happen crypto.com hatched a plan they were going to give an insane offer a debit card which gave you eight percent cash back on all purchases they would pay for your Netflix account they pay for your Spotify subscription Amazon Prime they would even put you in a private jet Partnership if you bought a lot of their crypto and promised not to sell it by locking it up also known as staking the more you staked the more you earned with their tiered system they had several cards on offering the top one being the obsidian card they advertise it gave you eight percent back on all purchases instantly all you have to do to get it is invest four hundred thousand dollars into the crypto.com token and stake it for like six months or something now of course if you're too poor for that you can try their lower tiers like the icy white or Jade collection in both cases you get slightly less rewards for paying a lot less money but if this is starting to sound like a Ponzi scheme locking outrageous sums of money into a system to get outrageous returns we haven't even gotten to the best part which are the staking rewards the other part of this whole scheme is that while you staked Kronos coin you made Kronos coin apparently they were giving 12 percent per year extra in Kronos to people who staked Kronos that's in addition to the subscriptions they're paying for eight percent cash back all of this stuff all you have to do to get all of it is be brave like Matt Damon says and give them four hundred thousand dollars for a while so that's the plan in a nutshell what could possibly go wrong oh oh crypto.com slumps 30 of staking rewards are slashed crypto.com soon after assembling every everyone in their website for this Flagship marketing campaign kind of was like yeah uh we're actually not gonna do that because it's unsustainable in in their words because you know all these crypto Arenas they have to buy they don't exactly have the money for it so as of May 1st they took all the cards and basically obliterated the rewards here's the change on screen you can see things like obsidian and icy got their rewards obliterated now understandably they're investors who staked incredible amounts of money into their Crow coin were completely pissed off about this because not only is their card in most cases nearly worthless also the price of their Crow which is locked up and they can't sell began to plummet right after this news was announced here's some quotes from their Reddit so I staked for Indigo at the peak because of the three percent cash back made it worth it micro is down over 50 percent and now they're slashing the cash back rates wow so basically people lost money on their staked money while also having the ability to get cash back slashed but the people in charge of crypto.com clearly felt like they were between a rock and a hard place on the one hand they had promised unsustainable things and spent their money on advertising on the other hand they might go bankrupt because the price of their token is going to zero and it was at this point the CEO decided to backpedal and give something back to the community he said in a comment quote the community has always been really vocal with regards to the changes to the card program announced yesterday we care deeply about the community and we'll always hear you and always listen to you as a result we're revising card staking rates it was at this point they gave a small concession back to the community they were going to re-implement the staking at a slightly lower rate but from the reaction it wasn't quite enough this guy says didn't know we were haggling for price at the fish market did we haggle to have a different stake amount when we applied for the crow card no we didn't and couldn't and here we have crypto.com spending Millions on Advertising now haggling with us on the rates so if we didn't make noise you would have just sliced us and diced us the answer to that of course is yes definitely yes and the worst part of all of this is that even after wrecking people on this sort of bait and switch deal crypto.com is still advertising their eight percent cash back rates even now and so what's the lesson here well as kind of trite as it sounds the real lesson is that if it sounds too good to be true Matt Damon will promote it anyways and by the way crypto.com CEO Chris uh that guy you should probably know before starting this crypto exchange he left his last job quote amid accusations from customers and business partners that they had been ripped off um but if that's not bad enough check this out one business owner quote claimed Chris's platform had issued promotions to boost its Revenue just before shutting down deals that were then left worthless so I don't know maybe you should add that in your commercial next time what does Matt Damon say on that Bitcoin commercial fortune favors the brave my dad said he listened to Matt Damon and lost all his body yes everyone did but they were Brave in doing so
