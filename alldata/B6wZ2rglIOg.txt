all right so I'm gonna be real right away when I look at this flux keyboard I get an immediate I have an immediate problem with it number one no concavity number two it's not even split to me this is gonna give you shoulder problems this is going to give you risk problems this is going to give you all the problems in the universe um but I'm willing to take a look at it but I I'm just telling you I personally no matter how amazing these keys are apparently magnetic floating keys or some nonsense I would never personally use this due to the fact that it is just all in one little square I mean I I used this thing for fun this is my gaming keyboard I use this for fun for a week straight I had wrist pain again for the first time in 10 years and it came on quick one week of typing on something like that damn okay hey get it split and get it concave boys concavity okay put those hands deep in the concaves you know what I'm talking about all right so let's see what happens here all right that's my hot take but I I do like seeing these new keyboards constant is change is that true what about Planck's constant does that count what about peep nerds pressure times volume equals nrt okay there's n okay there's R and like T changes sure or the noble gas law T changes but come on everybody knows about beef nerds and the multiple constants in it it does look beautiful I must say that to that looks like the tools we use to be in motion and control was that a twisty knob did I just see a Twist did I just see an effing twisty knob right there is that a twisty the only constant right now is an erection um this is extremely beautiful gosh I wish this thing was split but yes fully constantly erect right now [Music] to speak a universal language I like how they said to speak a universal language and they're showing various languages to speak a universal language to back up my point with dramatic footage and music Here's four separate different languages you're like what what you mean chat GPT chat Jeopardy you got some Jeopardy in there [Music] oh my goodness I I dude that was so sweet got that Borderlands man the floor oh no hey hon that wasn't Borderlands what am I saying that was uh taken for Borderlands that was uh yeah that's octane okay nevermind right that was okay introducing flux keyboard oh yeah flux makes computer interface paradigm the flux keyboard combines the tactility and speed of a mechanical keyboard with the adaptability of a touch screen I'm pretty sure at this exact moment that if you took this inner Venn diagram this intersection you made it into its own Circle and then you made a circle of people who are furries same Circle HD display yeah automatically fast to reveal the most relevant keyboard shortcuts and fully customizable macros for any software or in any language I'm confused by that last statement fully customizable macros in any language they run on wasm on this bad boy is this some sort of like wasm that'd be sweet imagine if they had like a little wasm Builder that'd be pretty that'd be pretty cool I mean that'd be pretty cool but you'd have to have like an API right does that mean they have to build an API in every language they support like how does that work it is an ergonomic nightmare I am actually completely shocked that a company that is like trying to Target people who program is my guess at least when I look at this this looks like a company that's Target you know targeting you know programmers OR tech people maybe they're targeting gamers but this is like not a tech person company or a keyboard This is not this is not this is not a tech person it doesn't say it has to be gamers any background image video or an interactive style which reacts to your actions you can program a little game that's pretty cool okay come on anyone come on can we can we agree here if that would be pretty cool to make a little Asteroids game while you're programming you can bam bam toss it on there Doom yeah I mean of course do do I mean Dooms the thing about Doom is it's already made it on one of those uh pregnancy monitors so I at this point our pregnancy tester so at this point of course it's gonna make it here like of course which also should just go to show that when you build something under super constrained resources man does that thing can just go anywhere today we have we are gluttons with the available CPU and memory that is available today it's crazy all rendered on an embedded processor allowing compatibility with any computer [Music] that's visible through a set of transparent maglev key switches actuation and Rapid trigger functionality for gaming that's kind of cool this idea oh that's kind of cool you can adjust the oh that's kind of cool I I would like that it would be super cool to be able to like adjust exactly how much pressure you want in it that's pretty neat but here's the problem does it click is it thonky does it thought uh what happens like do you get a little bit of this a little bit of that when you're typing or is it just like that's the sounds of magnets by the way if you didn't know if you didn't know keyframe can be swapped instantly typing for gaming [Music] four modules can be added to the keyboard to enhance your productivity and creativity we're at the rewind there for a quick second I I'm not even sure if I I understood what they just said the gaming on these key switches are all contained within a modular keyframe which can be swapped instantly between tactile keys for typing and linear keys for gaming [Music] that's pretty cool it'd be really cool if they could at least make this like a columnar columnar columnar layouts right can they change the layouts could you at least like kind of create something man if only they could make this split down the middle so you could like separate like do something other than I mean this is a great idea up to four modules can be added to the keyboard to enhance your productivity and creativity the side dial features a aluminum Wing transparent Rock I just hear myself an aluminum the proper way to say aluminum is that did we just all hear that a little aluminum going on this man's from this man's from across the pond the the music is giga cringe saying the phrase Giga cringe out loud but re reading it doesn't sound that bad but when you say it out loud damn that sounds even more cringe than the music that's Giga cringe bro sound like a dingleberry switch [Music] the triple dial module enables volume mixing or adjusting multiple variables and the triple key module makes important functions instantly available [Music] wise was that yet another game can you make a game for a little module oh my goodness digipets are coming back ninja pet or digimons whatever the hell they were called they're coming back Tamagotchis tamaguchi's baby I like that we're gonna call this bad boy tamaguchi written in Rust safe as feed me Daddy completes this revolution in interface design the music is literally like I'm watching Interstellar I'm watching Interstellar right now [Music] this is the is the free eight oh why did you have to do that this is where marketing department they just they can't do that okay Control Alt create just screams soy Dev to the highest okay it's just like hey bro I use wsl2 I'm a hacker man also you're like damn at least it's not Powershell I guess [Music] every synthwave video synthwave video man it's real it's so real the synthwave video flux me Daddy um all right flux if by any chance you come across this you watch this you obviously built a super cool keyboard but man you gotta figure out your target market you gotta figure out your target market okay folks oh is it folks false it's false clearly it's false I guess I've been lied to uh anyways false you got to figure out your target market are you going after gamers are you going after designers like what are you going after because what you built is like too many cooks got in the same kitchen and all tried to make something and now now look at it okay because this is not a programming keyboard it's just not it's not this is not a programming keyboard and anyone who programs on this may God have mercy on their souls and on their wrists and on their shoulders and on their spine you'll probably end up with Achilles tendinitis type it on the keyboard like that okay you don't want that you don't want to be that guy that gets Achilles tendonitis because you're using a shitty ass keyboard okay then you have to go around telling people why you got achilles tendonitis and No One's Gonna understand why you have it come on ridiculous the name is the primogen
