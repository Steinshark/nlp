so hello everybody i'm here with dr mario vagos some of you who are following all of this exciting universal history that i've been doing on my channel have seen my discussion with him on the kind of the mythical aspect of constantinople uh mario is the uh the author of a very interesting book on the symbolism of kings and emperors and from the near east all the way to byzantium and so uh he really he's really bringing to light the the things that we want to talk about in terms of the uh let's say the more legendary aspect of of these civilizational motifs and so today what we want to talk about together is this image of the the immortal emperor the image of the marble emperor and the notion of this emperor that kind of goes to sleep or vanishes and then comes back at the end that we see in the byzantine tradition but also we see in the western tradition in all kinds of motifs and we're going to dovetail that into a discussion about apocalyptic motif in byzantine thinking so i'm very excited to to uh to continue the discussion on universal history with uh with dr mario [Music] bagos this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world [Music] so dr mario thank you thank you for for joining me a second time i know that the reaction to our first discussion was really really exciting and people were were very fascinated by the things we talked about so i'm looking forward to our discussion today likewise jonathan i'm very much uh honored to be here again and um and i thank you for for inviting me again it's a great blessing yeah so tell us a little bit so i think we just need to dive right into it so tell us a little bit about the legends uh of the the marble emperor and the different versions of it and how this kind of ties into universal history okay well i was thinking of the best possible segue into such a vast topic because it's a big topic and before the recording we're talking about the various avenues that we could uh take in approaching it but in the 1970s and your greek uh viewers and listeners will know about this the the singer george dalaras and um harris alexia they released an album called asia minor migratia and on this album so this is what 50 years ago 60 years ago there was a song called the marble king or marmara menos vasilias and it talks about uh well hardy it's a female singer speaking about sending uh two birds to the red apple tree to hear about news concerning the marble king the red apple tree is a motif that appears constantly in the later byzantine apocalyptic literature it's either the place where the arabs or the turks originated from or on the borders between byzantium and and um islamic territories and these red apple trees in a region where those things that are written about us are the prophecies and everything else and those birds one is killed the other is wounded and they never return uh concerning the marble king there has been no word the song goes on to say um only uh he's only talked about in the fairy tales that grandma sings to young children so it's the motif of the marvel king is very much still in the popular consciousness of the greek people in 1998 stamatis who is a um a greek composer actually he composes a song with a choir called he will come like lightning or you will come like lightning sun and this song uh puts together a lot of the motifs concerning the marble king constantine dragas paleologos or constantine the eleventh the final emperor of byzantium uh who died defending uh the city from uh the final onslaught of the ottomans in 1453 the city of constantinople that we spoke about in the last video fell on may 29 1453 and so because of the circumstances surrounding his death we which we'll discuss perhaps a little bit later there are various let's say i don't know notions attributed to him the most famous one is that he was plucked from the point in which he was defending the city against the turks near the saint romanos gate one of the many gates in the theodosian walls that were on the landwood side of constantinople and that hadn't been breached up until that point the crusaders during the fourth crusade managed to get over them but they were breached for the first time with cannon fire we discussed that in the last video and so he was plucked from that spot instead of dying and was taken to the golden gate theodosius golden gate which was the main triumphal entrance into the city and there he was turned into marble by an angel and placed in a subterranean cavern um where he sleeps in this state of marble until such a time that he will rise and sort of take back the city and all these sorts of things um this song uh by spanish brings to the for all of the motifs that are associated with constantine by leologos [Music] king of kings helped the king vasilev vasilyan vasily which are the four beaters that appear on constantin paleolava's flag which you've probably seen it's red and yellow um mercy mercy heavenly god constantine constantinos by the grace of god emperor of the romans which is the way that he would sign off his correspondences at the gate of saint romanos writing his white-legged beast a steed story uh four betas uh which refers to the flag mercy mercy marble bosphorus and black tuesday so there's it's not really a narrative they're just various kind of images i mean taken and thrown together in this song that was just in 1998 um but the you got me thinking uh in preparation for this uh podcast what would let's say compel a christian civilization of course not authored not all orthodox were expecting the return of the marble king uh immediately after the fall of constantinople um it's more of let's say a superstition on a folkloric sort of level like a popular thing it's not something that uh either the saints of the church would really speak about or fathers or literati or anything like that so what would make them desire the return of the last emperor byzantium when the king had come already and has come already and will come again as we recite in every divine liturgy in the nicene creed we expect the resurrection of the dead and the life of the age to come the second coming of our lord jesus christ and he's already come so you know why the need to think about or to desire to expect a terrestrial ruler to set everything straight for us when the terrestrial ruler might be fixing the let's say sociopolitical circumstances or something like that restoring a worldly kingdom right irrespective of what that kingdom was constantinople of course was in endowed with much spirituality too and so is the byzantine empire but why expect the king to restore a worldly kingdom when you have the ruler of the kings of the earth our lord jesus christ that's the way he's referred to in the book of revelation um who's defeated death itself in his person with his resurrection on the third day and within the framework of the church the orthodox church we believe uh endows us with the let's say the grace to participate in his victory over death so if i can go to my local orthodox church and participate in its rhythms and its sacraments and have a foretaste however sinful i am of the resurrectional life that christ the king of kings the ruler of the kings of the earth gives to each and every member of his body the church why will i need a uh a terrestrial ruler to come back so that's what i've been wrestling with um and mostly because that motif is not just there in constantinople because it there are legends now i'm learning there are legends in almost every single christian nation that has this idea whether it's charlemagne or uh i think it's barbarossa and like all these different these different kings or our king arthur that is also kind of waiting in avalon to return so it seems like this motif is uh is one which is all over the the christian civilization and and uh the example in constantinople is just one kind of shining example of that of of that legend or that motif let's say that's right it's a shining example it's a very fascinating example i'll tell you i'm brought to tears nearly every time i returned to um to reading about the uh the circumstance that led to the fall of the city and and the death of its final emperor he was truly a heroic figure um he's not a saint but he's a heroic figure and we can maybe discuss a little bit later he's not considered a saint but uh if we look at this motif there must be something abiding because we're talking about universal history and we can also do universal history which is what you do so you know uh contemplating this approach um i was led to um i had written in the past the announce historians the french historians jacques legoff and george to be who speak about the structures mental and psychological structures that change only very gradually over long periods of time long dure and this motif of the final king the final emperor is one of the of those uh richard you know who is um he's doing great work in this uh in this area with you in in the previous podcasts uh he basically narrowed everything down to you know this uh this book here the apocalypse of pseudomethodius as being that watershed text that standardizes the byzantine and let's say western medieval image of the the last king the king who will return to put things right just before the second coming of christ if we're going to just hone in a little bit more in terms of the definition so uh he's absolutely correct i've been returning to this material and trying to trace the various trajectories that it that it leads to both in the east and in the west but um today with you i think we can go um a step further back in time before we move forward in time because a lot of this has to do with the way time functions and is perceived of and experienced in the middle ages and in the ancient world and we should look at the ruler cult which is uh let's say something it's a phenomenon that is uh associated with the rise of civilization at least in recorded history in relation to recorded history the propensity to venerate and even worship the ruler the king the emperor the pharaoh whatever you want to call him as a god as a deity um shall we go down that path yeah i mean i think that that's important mostly because can i say this mostly because the king because the first of all the image of christ is is an image of kingship you know this descendant of david the the image of king david is also an image of the kind of high point of israel you know even though it has its faults to it david and solomon are the high point in the story of israel uh you know the building of the temple all that is related also to kingship and so i think it's important to see how let's say how it existed it's been existed for millennia and then also how it was transformed in the in the christian story let's say i think that's that's definitely important well i'm so glad you mentioned uh king david and um the history of israel because that's precisely where things change you know he's not a god i mean it's palpable it's clear that he has weaknesses he has thoughts he's a servant of the most high god and so are his successes meant to be he's distinguished by his repentance of course um but uh and he's also his glory is in in whatever aspect of him is servant of god that's where his glory is and then in all those aspects where he is acting like almost he's acting like any other king would have let's say just by doing his own thing and taking women and doing all that then he is seen as being faultful and and needs to repent on that on that front let's say well that's right that that's so important for the whole uh penitential tradition and um and christian worship and experience isn't it i mean and it's all refracted through christ um whom david anticipates according to the flesh so all of this is that's where we're headed but we'll go back let's say to okay sumeria or mesopotamia i mean that happens to some of the material that i address in my book and i i also address king david um in the historical record uh it's in the 2400 bc around there where we have two rulers of agade which is a mesopotamian city a civilization that flourished there um sargon and naram sin who are seen as representatives of ishtar the goddess and ishtar uh was supposed to hold in her hands the principles of being for all of creation the meh or the mez in plural something like the logos and the logi but not articulated in such a philosophical or even in such an existentially meaningful way not as yet um they were participants in this what we could call demiurgic activity of ishtar so by demiurge creator deity four state he's considered demons from the perspective of the church okay so we acknowledge all of that but we're just looking at the trend of thinking here it's the earliest example that we have of the ruler cult of the ruler being worshiped as a god either because they represent the goddess in this case or they participate in the god or goddesses world shaping activity and this is reflected primarily in architecture ziggurats you know that represent the cosmic mountain so what the ruler kind of does is he reinitiates the cosmogony the creation of the world i spoke about this last time and this is even clearer in egypt which is almost simultaneously if not a couple hundred years later you have the pharaohs recapitulating the cosmos within their temples and acting as servants participants and embodiments of the demiurge in this this process the most emphatic example is you know uh the constant experience of the egyptians was when the nile floods everything is chaos so chaos and cosmos come into this the king generates cosmos to stave off chaos and there are deities that are agents of cosmos the demiurge being the principal one there are also deities that are agents of chaos so uh when the flood waters recede little hillocks was seen throughout the course of the nile and the egyptians transposed his experience onto their creation myths and said well at the beginning there was the formless expanse the waters of chaos the nun those receded and a hilly merge which represents order the demiurge simultaneously emerged posterior to mata and creation that's an important point to make because the christian god the trinitarian god is anterior to mata and creation because he creates the world out of nothing it's a massive revolution in terms of the history of religions and the way god is perceived of an experience how god reveals himself to the world but anyway the damage is posterior he does his shaping and ordering and the pharaoh participates in that in various ways whether he's building a temple whether he's holding a ceremony or a festival he's also fighting off the agents of chaos but all of this is a retrospective return to the time of creation the way that they perceived creation this is also the case to an extent uh with israel the people of israel except as um is the name of the russian uh author that you had with you recently also yes he speaks about the judeo-christian inaugurating a linear view of time um in the video and that's true it's not it's not exclusive to judeo-christianity and judaic christianity is in fact multi-layered because although you see a linear view of time manifested there's in time moving forward towards an expected outcome uh transformation of the world or something like that um the uh heavenly kingdom in christianity can be participated in which is the eternal kingdom at each and every divine service so eternity and the linear uh let's say duration of space intersect okay we talked about it as being kind of like a spiral like it's not it's it's it's it's kind of the joining of a circular in the sense of of there's a sense in which the the eschaton is a return to paradise but it's also above it's also above paradise there's a there's there is the circularity in even in that that's what you did you did talk about it yeah there is a circularity but it's not a it's not this eternal return it's really is like a let's say an upward spiral um of movement so yeah anyways perfect that's right it's not an eternal return the myth of the eternal return is what mircheliade uh used to describe the sort of phenomena i was just talking about in the mesopotamia but in uh although you have it in in israel for instance the the temple of um in jerusalem the temple uh is a recapitulated uh recapitulation of eden uh in the genesis narrative so the monumental pillars jaqen and boaz represent the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and so on and so forth and you have this recapitulation of that sacred pastime in the present but there's this linear trajectory and that's reflected throughout the text that linear trajectory is there in greece to the dawning of more or less a historical consciousness right um but you know you have a change in kingship providentially in both israel and greece but the greeks even though they were cynical towards their kings let's say at the beginning of greek civilization classical civilization in the 800's before that you have the um the mycenaeans and then before that the minoan so although they're cynical towards their kings the previous civilizations you see some cynicism with mycenae um and that's reflected in in homer because you know they're all battling each other and feuding and feuding and all sorts of things alexander ruins it all for them what makes it better whichever interpretation you want to take because he represents himself as a god as a divine world shaping agent and combines that with the notion of the philosopher king coming from plato who was the master of his teacher aristotle so with the greeks that ends but with the jews it's persistent the king is a mortal agent who serves the only true god who discloses his will to the prophets and the king the two branches that say of of jewish civilization in order to draw the people to god you have from a christian point of view the disclosure of god as father in a hinting towards the coming of his son and david is the paragon there as you mentioned david is the one who unites the 12 tribes of israel david is the one who conceives of the idea of the the temple which is built by solomon to house the ark of the covenant which is where god resides david has his failures um which we just mentioned and he repents but he becomes the paradigmatic king to such an extent that uh it was always expected that kingship uh in subsequent generations would imitate the davidic model um okay until the sixth century when the babylonian exile happens and the davidic line is severed forever kingship is then re-re-thought of then in order to project it into the future as a son of david who would come to restore israel back to this immediate relationship with god where everything was peaceful where he would execute judgment and before he could uh let's say create this just and peaceful civilization with the temple and god residing within it in its center he had to fight off israel's enemies and liberate them from bondage and you find this motif motif uh in ezekiel in isaiah in all of the old testament uh there already is a hint at least of something a pattern which is similar to this pattern of the returning king or the you know the idea of the the broken line which will be restored or however you want to to phrase it whether it's the actual king or his line that will sprout you know the the surprising sprout of the king which appears um so it seems like there's already a the motif is there even in the image of the messiah as the son of david it's it's there like so it's it's even before these medieval versions of this this this tradition in the messiah himself there's something of that of that trope let's say of the of the king that fell that died that disappeared and now will return at some point to restore things i couldn't agree with you more it's there it's there the king's line is broken the king will come a son of david will be raised by god in order to restore the kingdom uh to israel firstly and reinitiate this communion with god but something else sneaks into the prophecies there and that's disclosed by god providentially it's um the fact that the virgin shall conceive and bear a son and he shall be called emmanuel okay what's happening there what version i mean this is in isaiah right and then you have micah speaking about bethlehem as a place where this future figure will be born then you have the suffering servant motive which contrasts to the idea of a warrior king okay the one who will take the iniquities of israel upon himself and who as a lamb before his sheers remains silent you know he's beaten and afflicted for these of the people the son of man motif is then made very explicit in the book of daniel chapter seven where the son of man and that's the suffering servant figure that can be conflated he's not going to reign over one particular people as you see in isaiah and various other prophecies but he's given authority by the ancient of days interpreted by christians as god the father to reign over all peoples and all nations and that's christ because christ identifies himself as the son of man he's also identifying himself throughout his ministry as the son of god um and as the son of david so son of god son of man son of david all of these motifs are then transferred to christ in various ways we see that in the new testament he self-identifies as the son of man continuously in order to show that he's precisely this figure and as his ministry unfolds and widens let's say even after his ascension into heaven you see that he's the one gathering all people into his uh new community which is the church initially a refounding of israel through the 12 apostles who are like the 12 tribes of israel reconstituted but what kind of a king is he the master of the cosmos the pando as we spoke about in the last talk the son of god the father the lord who all things came into being who empties himself chaotically and assumes human nature as christ right the humble king utterly humble there's no the depths of humility are penetrated and encompassed by christ and that's what that's dramatically reflected in the final week of his um life before his crucifixion and thereafter his resurrection so riding into israel on a donkey which is a despised creature so on and so forth um my kingdom is not of this world he's saying to pilate and uh what does this king well what does he endow us with um material goods and glory and uh no actually uh he endows us with the conquest of death itself um and sin and devil that had the power and the devil that had the power of above through his resurrection on the third day so different kind of king the everlasting king what happens thereafter is something that we were talking about before jonathan is that the church which is the body of christ as it goes out into the world as it goes on let's say its journey to witness to um to christ and to the fact that he's inaugurated eternal life in his person he himself gives the mandate go forth and baptize all nations in the name of the father and the son and the holy spirit and i'll be with you until the end of the age as the church does this it encounters hostility and opposition from worldly powers worldly kingdoms one kingdom in particular rome and if we speak about rome we have to speak about augustus of course who is uh the first roman emperor uh in the same way that alexander was the first greek king to uh initiate the rule of cult to call himself sacred in perpetuity in his lifetime at least his uncle had the uh you know the good sense to be uh made of god after he died by the senate exactly yeah that's i always but there there's an interesting there's an interesting moment because there's also an interesting moment in the sense that to understand that christ was was alive at during the time of augustus that there is almost this these two narratives being set up or these two stories of a divine king that are that are let's say put in parallel because it says also that christ was born like in the in the bible it's it's made explicit that he was born during the time of augustus so there seems to be there there right there in scripture there seems to be laying up these two images of what of a divine king let's say you know one which is truly the divine king and is hidden in the world almost like almost like king david was hidden when saul was king so saul is this king and king david is a hidden king that no one knows about until his fruits are revealed later but you get it you get this so you do get this you do get this image of of of these two divine kings let's say the contrast between these two images you get a contrasting image which for apologetic purposes the church will try to temper and that's reflected as early as the new testament you know saint paul appeals to his roman citizenship christ says render unto caesar what he sees as unto god what is god's um you know saint paul says elsewhere pray for your rulers at the same time these rulers are presenting themselves as divine and when christians refuse to take that extra step which is to worship them as gods to pour libations on their statues and like incense to them they're murdered they're killed these are the martyrs who die as intercessors to christ as you know and reign with him forever but the the interesting thing is now you have two trajectories set up um a kind of more conciliatory approach towards the world because after all the world has to be baptized for christ right and one which is a bit more perceptive of the underlying reality behind the world outside the church which is let's say in its fallen state a satanic or demonic one and this is reflected in the book of revelation which you've discussed um uh before um the uh now we're gonna talk about the scholars and i don't know whether but um the scholars like to say that uh the two beasts one that comes out of the sea and one comes out of the the earth in the book of revelation that are raised by the devil which is the other beast many beasts and who can keep track of how many heads they have and horns and and everything else right but um the one that comes out of the sea is the roman imperial cult and the emperors generally who demand to be worshipped as gods and the one that comes out of the earth is the priesthood encouraging people because that's what the second beast does it encourages people to worship the first beast yeah that's right so um and then the two witnesses there enoch and elijah they're interpreted as enoch and elijah and that's the martyrs generally uh simultaneously so what you have is a possession of the roman ruler cult as uh evil and rome is identified with babylon and all these sorts of things and um this came directly out of the christians experience they were being massacred we know that the nero um in order to find a scapegoat for the fire that he himself lit and burned down much of rome uh put christians on uh spikes and burnt them alive um so we know we know that um that there was this kind of uh hostility towards what had come into the world the light that had come into the world with christ and which was being disseminated through his apostles and and and the churches that they established uh the apostles 11 of the 12 are martyred of course the exception of saint john saints peter and paul are martyred in rome famously during the reign of the emperor nero and so we have um all of this happening and martyrdom is a paradoxical phenomenon we lament the deaths of the martyrs but they participate immediately in the kingdom of christ in the eternal kingdom so they are translated to paradise forever now well this is happening but you know the church will still in the intervening let's say decades and centuries be declaiming the romans for unlawful unlawfully putting them to death and casting aspersions about you know uh their behavior and you know the sacraments and all these sorts of things which the romans had misinterpreted and at the same time they're trying to encourage them to uh you know we pray for you uh you know uh we wish you all the best but we're not gonna worship you and it's this back and forth and you find that in the apologetic literature minutes felix in the in the west and st justin mata famously in the yeah that's really important to me this point that you made is very important because there's a sense let's say in popular understanding and in i would say in kind of modern understanding that if these things are in opposition that there there's a sense in which the people they tend to decry rome or decry the emperor decry the king in modern thinking kind of modern democratic thinking uh as being opposed to god necessarily the very k the very in the idea of kingship or the very idea of authority is somehow wrong and we need to worship god and then be suspicious of of authorities right especially in american culture you kind of have that that sense but the christians even the early christians even though they were martyred even though they were persecuted they would still say obey the rule but this like except for this they were they were seen as model citizens except for the fact that they refused to participate in pagan cults and worship the the emperor but for all roman laws they were they would tell christians to obey the laws obey the rules you know follow what the these authorities are given to you by god but we will not participate in the the aspects of them which are psychologists and which are which are demonic but we but we still recognize them as being given to us by god and so there's a key in there where it is that when suddenly the authorities become christian then suddenly there is no reason there is no reason to continue to oppose the rulers because they were already subject to them and already obeying their rules yeah well this is a fascinating point and actually you know the providential arrangement of all things if we believe that providence grace and god's presence is there in all events and all factors in life i mean that doesn't make him a causal agent in all of them so that people don't you know associate um persons in in all things with you know the uh him causing people to die or something like that we need to be careful and that's actually another topic of the odyssey but um because providence arranges things to bring about ultimately a good end for as many people that choose to respond freely to this providential let's say outreach that god does for each and every one of us right then he permits the circumstances including uh the governments and kingships of the past and because of our fallen state because we you know we have our passions and our sins and we don't want to repent and turn to god he permits um even the martyrdoms that took place there because without those martyrdoms i mean we can decry them and you know it's a horrible thing that the apostles were killed from their point of view perhaps it's not as bad saint paul says i can't wait you know i'd rather be with christ and disappear in the body not that the martyrs and see it's all very slippery slopey because uh the martyrs were discouraged from actively seeking martyrdom right when these one or two examples came up later on um but because god discloses even to the martyrs that they will die as martyrs this creates an incredible testimony martis is witness a witness which brings more and more people to the gospel and initiates them into the life of christ so the martyrs as they die go from this world to the next only forever those who they bring with them at the moment of their martyrdom live forever with them and this in the early days included pagans who converted on the spot you know um and the testimony kind of extends beyond that to people who read the materologies who venerate them in church you know we have this panoply this great cloud of witnesses if you like that intercede for us so even the the roman empire persecuting the the saints from a certain point of view was good for the church but don't misinterpret me i'm saying this more to the listeners you know i mean yeah well it's a christ says scandal must happen but woe to those by whom it happens it's it's not a praise of scandal but there's an understanding in which these events and these these deaths act as as seeds for the future world uh but it doesn't justify those that killed them the martyrs and those that did those horrible things it doesn't thank you for pointing that out but then what happens after that that period of let's say intermittent persecution up until our favorite person comes along saying constant in the grave is here um what did he say that we're the three people who still uh love constance still have constantine yeah that's right but look i'll tell you what uh jonathan i really do believe at the moment in 315 a.d so he'd been a christian officially for three years you know after seeing um the uh in dutonica by the sun conquering the sky and defeating maxentius and you know he's in rome and they're erecting that triumphal arch to him next to the coliseum the amphitheater of larvian and constantine refuses to participate in the sacrifices to jupiter that is a fulcrum point in world history right there and there are a lot of moments like that in the reign of constantine so you know i mean for a roman emperor to go no you know to be disgusted with this kind of uh behavior idolatrous behavior it's just it's it's a changing point anyway i'm curious one question i have is also about the art about the emperor worship him itself and so was there a change during the time of constantine because we know that from the time of augustus it seems like the the emperor seemed to have that almost almost inevitably have this title as as god himself or son of god or some kind of divine title and so is there something that to help us understand how constantine reacted to that tradition well look some people say that he might have committed sacrifices to be done in his uh image in various uh territories in the empire but there's there's no way that that would have happened in those territories in which he was erecting uh christian churches almost everywhere uh in and around rome constantinople the holy land so he's a transitionary figure which means that he needed to placate the pagans while at the same time christianizing the topography he retained the title pontifex maximus the greatest bridge between heaven and earth which was not uh relinquished by emperors until either gratian or theodosius gave it to pope really the ma with the masses yes and i'm pretty sure it's theodosius because he was incredibly uh pious yeah he gave over the title of pontifex maximus is not befitting the the emperor interesting yeah yeah so constantine still had it but you know you need to put the man in his context it would be unfair to say just because he still had it that he demanded to be worshipped in the same way that caligula did or something like that you know these two things do not stand together uh especially in light of all of the other uh pro-church things he did that we discussed last time so there's no chance i think in dwelling on those but constantine changed the game and then in the fourth century immediately after his reign we get the first apocalyptic text which was already mentioned by richard that speaks about a final king and that's the tibiatine sybil if i'm pronouncing uh it right now the symbols being the oracles the roman oracles who spoke about future events and and you've already addressed them at length but this is the interesting bit i've got the quote here that refers to the name and it's the only text in late antiquity and in the byzantine period that refers to this final king a final emperor by name um and it goes like this then we'll arise a king of the greeks at the end times and always the end times are preceded by uh devastation destruction and all these sorts of things um that lead to a final renewal that christ says this about the end times as well but what we need to before i read this it's important to mention what we need to articulate in relation to the christian experience is that christ has already within himself objectively accomplished everything that will unilaterally and universally happen at the end which is the transformation of the universe in light of his kingdom the final judgment of the righteous of the unrighteous the defeat of the devil and sin and death they've already happened in his person with his resurrection ascension into heaven and while it's happened in him objectively all these things that happened in him objectively they unfold subjectively within his body the church when people participate in the sacred rhythms of the church through repentance participation in the sacraments prayer and the the proof of this we have the saints who are able to do by christ's grace what he did and does uh but not to the same extent that yeah well i i i think that for a lot of people watching this that watch my channel understand this fractal pattern which is that you know that christ and christ first of all plants us a seed which contains the pattern in itself and then also has the cosmic pattern in the end which will be kind of the totality of of in the incarnation playing itself out cosmically and then it plays out at different level levels whether it is in the lives of the saints whether it is in the liturgical year it is our own participation in the liturgy and then also even historically plays out in these mini cycles where you see little images of the kingdom of god appearing in different places in the world where there are moments where things seem to to come together and we see like in the example of constantinople where constantinople is a little image of the new jerusalem it's not a complete image it has still has its fault it still has it it's uh it's its difficulties but it nonetheless is a little glimpse and a little fractal version of the the giant cosmic one that we see in in revelation and that's a beautiful way to put it so i mean that that's the standard now and so everything that we're looking at uh from this point onwards in relation to the final emperor is a deviation from that standard in some it can be a benign deviation right because you know the the final king is not christ therefore you know it's something that christians from a liturgical perspective uh from the point of view of the the essence of the life of the church they don't expect it but it comes up in popular culture it comes up in times of stress and anxiety and desperation and and this is why it's important to to understand it so that you know when we do endure difficult circumstances we don't we aren't beguiled and necessarily into thinking that the solution is in you know many cri mania for false christ and antichrist have indeed come is what um saint john says in the in his epistles and that plays out throughout history especially around the time of the reformation but we we might talk about that later so returning back to the tibriton uh sybil then will arise the king of the greeks his name is constance he will be king of the romans and the greeks and he will be told of stature of handsome appearance and shining face etc so describes his physique it describes the fact that he's king of the romans and the greeks greco-roman civilization roaming compass greece but why constance uh you know i couldn't get past it because i looked through this book by paul j alexander the byzantine apocalyptic tradition that analyzes this text briefly and i couldn't i couldn't find a solution we do have a constans in the fourth century immediately what happened after the death of constantine and let's let's to answer this question we have to look a little bit at the end of his reign so constantine did a lot of good stuff at the church he's a saint of the church i accept that you know venerate him because of um of all that he accomplished and you know the inner life of a person no one can know so let's just accept tradition and not the eight million other constantines in scholarship that we get right um and uh he gets he described in his war with lycenius his final rival emperor because he basically um demolished the tetraki the rule of the four emperors that uh uh was set up by diocletian the persecuting emperor the one who initiated the great persecution just before constantine's reign and lycenius was one of the last to go he refers to him in his letters the dragon lycenius assimilating him to the dragon which is the chaos entity the monster the devil in this sense and according to eusebius's life of the emperor and you see mrs caesarea i love you cebus he's very important but he's also incredibly problematic because he does all of that uh pagan panigalizing of the emperor which gives the emperor a bad name actually that's part of the reason why uh eusebius uh had a mixed reception in byzantium but everybody read his history his history is one of the most important works of playing antiquity so um in his life of constantine which goes well beyond the norms of any rising constantine he describes a panel set above the entrance to constantine's palace in constantinople which had on it the crystagram the cairo a land so the cairo was on top of a javelin and on the lance was like a crossbar with a um a portrait of constantine and his three sons and this lance was driving the serpent into the abyss so you can interpret this um as uh spiritually you know through the reign of the christian uh emperor um uh the evil is being or spiritual evil is being kept at bay through the churches he built all these sorts of things and that's fine but there's also a historicist way of interpreting this as the emperor defeating his terrestrial enemies and they are the actual uh evil ones not the evil behind them and all of us that attempts us to sin which the only real enemy of the christian people along with death so you know um this particular image uh what is it well what do you do with it yeah well the interesting thing about it is that it seems at least the image like let's say if you take the symbol is the very symbolism of the image itself and we don't try to give it um we don't try to interpret it historically like what the dragon is it's a dragon let's say it's just a dragon there's a sense in which this could be an image of the proper emperor right so you have above at the top you have this image of christ as the i really as the son of god as the the son of man as this cosmic virgin of the king and then below then you have a an image of the actual king and his descendants who are below the image of christ that are kind of let's say being a tool or or an image of of of christ and then then they becoming a tool for christ in the world to to vanquish evil or to push away the the the evil aspects of reality so that's one way then the other way the cynical way is of course to see the emperor as using christ to justify whatever that they want to do politically which is that which is those are the two images of of civilization let's say and you always hear one version you hear the version that especially in modern times we hear the cynical version you know that that let's say kings and the church or whatever use the excuse of god or christ to then do whatever it is they wanted to do and to defeat their enemies but i think that we always need to be able to understand the two interpretations because it is also true that god uses our our civil authorities uses the powers of the world to hold chaos at bay because without civilization you know we would be eaten i i know because i've lived in places where civilization was breaking down and where states were fallen and it doesn't look like a nice you a nice happy a world where people hold hands it looks like a bunch of warlords that will come and take whatever they want and you have no way of stopping them and so there is a there is an the reality of civilization can really be a tool for god to bring about a kind of peace in the world i agree with you i agree with you 100 and actually what you mentioned about the way civilization is used to generate order out of chaos is another apologetic motif that's used by minutius felix and others that uh uh providentially christ is one actually we chant this and i don't remember in which um in which service christ is providentially born during the reign of augustus the one who united the disparate king and this is augustus who's let's face it idolatrous right you know so he's he he calls himself sacrosanctus i am holy perpetually in his um gusty the uh the epic graph um epigram that uh was distributed throughout the the empire he intended it for being distributed after he died in greek and latin but anyway but even under him right because he manages to unite all of the warring and disparate factions [Music] this multiplicity and divisive multiplicity seen as diabolical his unifying agency is in the background behind the scenes engendered by god so that not directly not as you know like so that we don't confuse christ augustus but behind the scenes god allows this unification to happen so that christ the one true king of everybody can be born within a relatively peaceful context so that's an apologetic motif and it's uh uh it's recurrent in the early period and still in the church but uh look the fact that the lava or the lava room that's what this uh image is in constantine's palace of the speed javelin the the snake or the dragon the lava is still used in orthodox services points to the fact that it is the spiritual interpretation because we have the lava not necessarily with constantine with the resurrected christ on it we have at my parish at saint catherine's uh saint catherine on the lavaro and so on and so forth and we process it it's a spiritual tool it's the roman let's say standard spiritualized and that's fine because the church did that with a lot of things so but what we um what we have with uh happening in the fourth century thereafter is precisely the cynical approach that you mentioned picked up by constantine's successor he's one of his sons and that cynical approach inaugurates a trajectory whereby the ruler cult is rehabilitated under the aryan kings that govern intermittently throughout the fourth century until theodosius the great another awesome emperor if we're going to be extilling constantine we have to extol theodosius as well okay they're about saying to the church in any case theodosius comes along and he puts an end to all of this but that's in 381 constantine dies in 337 and in the into nicene period 325 is the castle of nicaea 2381 the second ecumenical council in constantinople it's like all hell broke loose against the council of nicaea that affirmed that christ is one essence with the father fully god because if he's not fully god and thus and eternal in such a way he cannot save us liberate us from the opposite of eternity which is death okay so the church had already experienced and always experienced christ as fully guarded eternally but it articulated this in a specific way at the council of nicaea all hell breaks loose against his council and saint athanasius um the bishop of alexandria athanasius the great um is the locus of a lot of this antagonism because he's the great champion of nicaea in this period again he's misinterpreted by scholars they've done a lot of damage to athanasius's reputation but on my academia page you can find a chapter and an article uh that rehabilitates the traditional approach to ethanasius and and it's it's more sound than what scholars come up with why am i talking about athanasius who is exiled five times in the 300s by aryan kings who in fact points out their their use of the ruler cult because arianism is more palatable to the rule of cult if christ is made a the highest of all created beings because that's what arianism posits that he's a creature he's not of one essence with the father and thus eternal and god in the same way that god the father is god but if he's a creature i'll be at the highest creature nevertheless he's a bit closer to the emperor don't you think because he's on this side of the ontological gap between the uncreated and the created if he's in one essence of the father he's uncreated in the way that the father is uncreated eternal divine what is distinct is his personhood but he shares the same nature and essence with the father and the spirit does the same but if he's on this side of the created order well the emperor can still go about masquerading as divine and he does that constantius constant sun because three sons take over various parts of the empire and to make things even more confusing they're all named in some ways a variation after constantine so there's constantine the second there's constans who's mentioned in the tibetan sybil i believe it's him and there's constantius the second not the first that was constantine's father constantius ii is the aryan he kills off constantine the second and he fights with constance athanasius accuses constantius a second and a couple of bishops around him airing bishops and he says concerning these two bishops lusakis and violence they dared to call the emperor eternal while at the same token they belittle the son of god and call him a creature so they continue to refer to the emperor's eternal anyway constance protects athanasius and he even threatens to go to war with constantius over the protection of athanasius because constantius wanted him dead so is it this constantius uh he's gotten a mixed uh the reception in scholarship and again you've always got to put the question mark up in relation to the scholars because you don't know what hermeneutical lens they're using to interpret figures but he was according to the traditional sources the ancient sources an orthodox king who protected athanasius and he went down in history that way why i mention nothing else is he dominates the literature in the fourth century sozumen's history socrates history theodoran's history written in the 400s they're all talking about athanasius so it could be him anyway this emperor's reign is characterized and now we're going back to the tibia time sybil um by great wealth and victory over the foes of christianity and end of paganism and the conversion of the jews so what we have here the antagonistic forces to let's say emergent christendom in this context in the fourth century are the uh pagans and jews and that should not be interpreted because people are quick to jump on the um vilification bandwagon there was uh conflict going on between these three groups for centuries up until this point you know the first christians were jews and then pagans were brought into that the jews persecuted christians then pagans persecuted christians so don't read more into it i'm saying this more for listeners and viewers than what's there okay so uh christianization of the empire is what will happen and he will vanquish the emperor will vanquish gog and magog mentioned in ezekiel richards spoke about them you both i spoke about gog and magog the unclean cannibalistic worse than the haredream you know uh driven by alexander the the great beyond the gates of the north he seals them in that later text the apocalypse of pseudomethodius um after defeating these unclean nations uh the emperor goes to jerusalem puts off his diadem from his head lays aside his imperial garb and hands over the empire of the christians to god the father and to jesus christ his son and this is still in the sybil now this is it yourself wow so it's all there right there in the fourth century it's all right there in the fourth century this anticipates the apocalypse of pseudomethodius which takes up all of these motifs except um and you know it's the same kind of trajectory with uh the sybil you have constance defeating um the enemies of christianity and then um uh later on the future emperor in pseudo methodius and other texts defeats the ishmaelites with the arabs and then after that gog and magog appear on the scene um after defeating them or before facing off against them he defeats them he defeats gog and magog um [Music] and then he goes and gives up his scepter and his crown um at golgotha dies and then the antichrist comes and you know the second coming happens just after that there are variations of this kind of model and the antecedents are there in the tibetan uh civil um the surprising thing is that a lot of these motifs are going to appear again with the final king of constantinople um the eastern roman empire founded by constantine uh in thrace shores of the bosphorus we spoke about it last time and that's what we're going to move to how are we going with time uh jonathan i mean i'm fine to keep going i think i think it's important so i'm not a we can just you can just we can just continue if you if you're okay i mean i would i would say we can maybe kind of move towards the towards the towards the the different legends but i think this is important to set the base you know of where this kind of tradition comes to comes from let's say in terms of the the the sybil and also um but yeah so but we can slowly kind of move towards also why why there's a sense of this this this emperor that is potent in potential or sleeping why like if you have a sense of why that is why that happens um and then maybe the difference because there is a difference between let's say the divine emperor and the emperor that that gives over his his his diadem to christ you know that it might seem uh for some people it might seem like a uh they may be cynical about it but in terms of narrative there is a difference between the cult of the emperor and the emperor who who ultimately gives up his power to christ you know even in his own victory yes you're right and in fact that's something that i argue towards the end of my book that you know often the byzantines um eastern christian romans and generally christendom is accused of caesar's papism but especially byzantium the fact that the emperor was both priest and king in the way that made him kind of semi or quasi divine um notwithstanding the fact that uh paneer assists even up until justinian's time used that kind of rhetorical language about the emperor uh quasi divine language and um and in spite of the fact that the emperor would kind of represent himself with a halo nevertheless caesar a papism did not necessarily apply because the more suitable model in an environment which is conditioned by christ and his saints through the church and its shepherds and teachers the bishops is the old testament model it's not the pagan model the pagan model dissipates and every time you have an imposition of the state because the state lapses into this hubris several times in byzantium the most emphatic example we just mentioned the aryan controversy in relation to constantius ii but later on the most emphatic example is iconoclasm when they begin to break the the icons and they begin to the empress begin to act in a way which kind of gives the impression that they are in charge of the church but at that time god raises up he raises up saints shepherds of the church usually of bishops but also monks and nuns and lay heroes to tell the emperor you know take care of the world outside the church and leave leave the church to its shepherds and teachers in fact the church is never under the empire in byzantium which is a mistake that many scholars again make in relation to assessments of this empire even when the church works with the state and constantine initiates this when he convokes the council of nicaea they are working together but he's not presiding at the council it's a bishop of the church who's presiding at the council saying oh she's of course over so we need to make this very clear that the church is one thing the state is another when the state in spite of its ostensible christianity would um exert itself against the church uh uh impose heretical doctrines or behave in a way which was scandalous the church very often accused it of such and castigated it and um if it was persecuted then subsequent emperors would have to learn from the disciples of the martyrs of the previous generation whose boss and this happened back and forth throughout the history of this empire it's remarkable one of the reasons why the empire is considered as falling and again things are nuanced and complicated it's not just a matter of the empire compromising at the end although it did on an imperial level have all this great spirituality we spoke about it last time one of the reasons why it's interpreted as ending is because of the imperial court's questioning acceptance to come under the roman catholic church of the time in order to solicit imperial support and he didn't listen to the church so you know so we need we need to that's the broader the broader let's say framework but let's let's delve into it then talk about the sleeping king you're right the sleeping king who wakes up rouses off his drowsiness and goes to fight the enemy let's say clearing the path for the second coming of christ it's not um let's say doctrinal eschatology it's a variant it's it can even be a dangerous one but it's nothing like the divine kings of the past he's a servant still this king irrespective of how good he might be but where the motif of him slumbering and waking up comes from is actually from the syriac pseudomethodius um just to recapitulate uh it's attributed to saint methodius of olympus um in the syriac text or of patara in the greek text fourth century this was a fourth century figure but uh again this text was composed in the seventh century um after the um islamic conquest of syria palestine and egypt so you know it comes from a different context um we saw with the tibetans uh sybil that if it's constance that it's talking about there's a lot of socio-political um and religious chaos in the fourth century um we have the same circumstances happening in the seventh century so these prophecies arise whenever civilization is destabilized okay and so um definitely that was fertile ground the 600s for the um rising up of this particular kind of apocalyptic anxiety um so the manuscript um again it speaks about it's not the history of the world so it's part chronicle part apocalypse so chronicles were at least in the christian context initiated by julius africanus the apologist and later you see mrs caesarea just tables and dates really of um the reigns of kings cross reference of the olympiads because at that time at least before the onicious exiguous came up with the no domini dating system and various other chronographers and uh computational thinkers let's say came up with the anno mundi dating system it's reflected in this text to some extent because it goes by oh gosh more and more stuff is coming to mind it goes through uh the unfolding of time from the creation of the world adam and eve through thousands of years leading to the year 7000 right which is modeled upon the recurrent week of time that we see in genesis and that we in fact experience a seven day weekly cycle the end of the seventh uh the end of the six thousands of the year beginning the seven thousandth year inaugurating that apocalyptic time and this is known as millenarianism that year reign of christ with his saints and there are many people in the middle ages trying to figure out and in the dark ages trying to figure out whether or not christ comes before the uh beginning of the 7000th year or just after it when will antichrist come just before the inauguration of the year 7000 or just after it um or where did christ come at the beginning of the year 6 000 and does this represent the millennium up until the beginning of the year 7000 where everything will end you know so this um it can all get pretty messy but it's the backdrop from a chronological perspective to this text and that factors in later on when we talk about constantinople so um this text goes for a history of the world and you've spoken about with richard already you know the various important junctures that it talks about talks about um again the rise of this ishmael and you know again many people would interpret this as you know the muslims taking over christian territory and they're seen in a very antagonistic sense well they are because people who are conquered are seeing them this way and sees pseudomethodius this way but the reason why these conquests happen is because of the sins of the christian people that's what he says that's also reflected in later uh resentions of this text in the slavonic daniel it's called which is written in the circumstances the the arab conquest of sicily from the byzantines so again a different same yet different kind of text but the accusation is never against the terrestrial enemies the act well it's a description of what they do let's say in times of conquest but it's a uh reflexive accusation that's meant to lead to repentance it's because of the sins of the christian people that these things happen right and you know that's that's there in constantinople with the fall of the city in 1453 um the first ecumenical patriarch after the fall of the city uh before he becomes patriarch he's still a monk at the time he basically says you know uh romans you're losing your city because uh instead of putting your faith in god you put your faith in the italians you know so um in terms of coming under roman catholicism so there's all of that right apocalyptic anxiety um uh kind of introspection concerning why these things might be happening and um the references to after the uh sleeping emperor rises and defeats um the ishmaelites gog and magog and all of that but here is where the texas syriac text describes the sleeping emperor for the first time this last roman emperor will go forth and will be awakened or aroused against them that's the arabs like a man who shakes off wine one who plots against them as if they were dead so something about you know amidst the sins of the christian people he's um he's kind of like uh neutralized until this shocks him into action okay yeah there's a sense in which like even the idea of shaking off wine in the sense of being asleep not just being asleep uh in terms of attention too in the sense of being distracted being being uh you know falling into conflagration and being just this this kind of uh dissipated king let's say that wakes up from from his drunkenness so it's a it's it's it's a little different from the idea of the marble king but it definitely those two images together are very interesting if you to actually kind of join them together it's like fielding almost uh that's where my mom yeah exactly yeah very much like that image of their man that's a good that's a that's actually a good uh in terms of the waking up from being from being drunk or asleep in that sense yeah that's a good image that's that's uh that's right um but that that actual description this is strange because the author of uh pseudonym authorities is not going back to the book of revelation necessarily because of the all of the anti-roman imagery in that text right he's got to look elsewhere revelation is the backdrop to to some of it of course but this uh depiction of the sleeping king actually appears originally in relation to the lord to god in the psalms and in psalm 78 verses 65 to 66 we read then the lord awoke us from sleep as a warrior wakes from the stupor of wine he beat back his enemies he put them to everlasting shame it's basically transposing role that belongs to god to this last emperor of the romans the lord waking up which is strange for us to really you know this very anthropomorphic way of describing god waking up yeah but you could also see it because it says that it's the emperor that shakes himself off like someone from wine so you could see it as if it's god waking him up like he's the warrior being a being awoke being woken up in the psalms like it says in the psalms that god will wake up the warriors and so maybe it's the king that is being made awake that is being woken up by god as someone who was drunk and kind of dissipated let's say well that's a reading of it definitely i mean that's the way that they would have read it i think that the apocalypse you know god waking up the sleeping king but in the psalm it's it's a simile in relation to to god yeah i mean yeah it's an interesting nuance but the greek translation changes things a bit which will i mean tell me what you think of this so the greek translation of pseudomythology says and i've taken this not from um this version uh the de martin oaks version translated by benjamin garcia i've taken it from paul j alexander's translation in the byzantine apocalyptic tradition the greek translation of the text says then there will suddenly arise against them the ishmaelites with great fury and emperor of the greeks or romans he will awaken from his sleep like a man who had drunk wine up up to this point it's the same but he's added great fury okay who men considered like one dead and utterly useless in the previous texts they are the ones with the enemies are the ones who are dead in this text it becomes reflexive it's the king who was like one who was dead and utterly useless so i mean this fits into the image that you were drawing actually recently i i thought of that when i was reading this um and i can't wait to see how that uh that ends up but um another interesting motif that's very important in the apocalypse of pseudomethodist is the connection between and this is more richard's stuff but i just want to mention it very briefly because it comes up in later apocalypses um okay alexander is the one who uh chases the unclean nations uh to the north and puts up a gate with a special kind of a material on it that actually has no correspondence in reality whatever magic whatever it is uh to keep them at bay right and then after that we read about the marriage of uh beezus and i didn't see the ethiopian video yet so i don't know did richard discuss uh the marriage of business and who said a little bit we're going to talk about it more in the next one but we we we mentioned a little bit how uh the importance we of uh ethiopia appears in a byzantine apocalypticism right and it's the place where out of which let's say the the emperor will the hidden emperor kind of is coming out of ethiopia let's say at the end yeah oh yeah i mean i'll touch upon it briefly now because i don't want to kind of uh uh you know impose upon what comes up next with you and richard but the visas of course is business of mercado who founded byzantium uh the greek polis later turned into constantinople by constantine husseth is the daughter of the ethiopian king so greece and ethiopia are connected they have a daughter named byzantia who is married to rome to romulus amelos and then romulus hameles gives her rome as a dowry so that's that's interesting because there's a whole shift politically speaking from the old rome to the new that's manifested in 381 with the second ecumenical council that makes new rome constantinople second to the old rome in terms of the um let's say that the taxes the order of the ancient seas of christendom and by the time you get to the 500s in justinian's time that becomes the pentaki the five main seas of christendom rome first among equals later then constantinople alexandria antioch jerusalem after the great schism it becomes constantinople alexandria antioch jerusalem so that that's interesting i think um and uh then uh you know it follows the same kind of trajectory that uh the king of the romans after being awakened defeats the ishmaelites and then there's an invasion of the unclean nations who are the gog and magog defeated by the king and then he goes to golgotha lays down his crown receptor dies the cross goes up to heaven because it's meant to go before christ when he comes again then you have uh the revelation of antichrist the son of perdition which is the way saint paul refers to him um in thessalonians um once he appears and kills enoch in elijah you have the second coming and nothing is said about what happens after the second coming and that's basically the apocalypse of pseudomethodius uh following to some extent the tibetan sybil um except it doesn't give a name for the king it it mentions in more detail based on the psalms this notion of the king being asleep and waking up being aroused from drunkenness um the greek text ads being uh as one who was dead and then he springs into action i mentioned earlier that later on um in the 9th century we get a further reduction of this text but all of the chronic chronographical and chronological material leading up to um the rise of the last roman emperor is omitted it's all gone you get the same stuff happening later uh ishmael likes gog and magog goes to jerusalem gives up all world the authority antichrist comes and then the second coming happens but um instead of being given to methodius of olympus or patara this revelation is disclosed to the prophet daniel by the archangel gabriel and it's being written in the ninth century um it's been dated to around the early 800s so the second wave of iconoclasm has affected the byzantine empire theophilus uh the emperor was probably on the throne at the time and iconoclast and that's actually reflected within the text because the archangel gabriel says to the prophet uh daniel four beasts come out of the sea and that's that's harkening back to daniel and the first one is the isorian dynasty which was the dynasty that initiated the first wave of iconoclasm in the 700s that's a beast so you see it's not just a matter of criticizing um the ishmaelites or those outside it's also a matter of criticizing uh the imperial court which had betrayed the ordinances of god let's say the tradition of the church um in this case being the isorians and and i think i think one of the things that's important for people to notice here also is how the let's say the apocalyptic motif it really it's not only it's ultimately not just talking about something like this cosmic end of time but seems to be brought back and reused as a kind of pattern of manifestation which which appears in these moments of difficulty and so we could we can we can i think that if we're a little perceptive we can pull back and notice how it's acting as a as a kind of a lattice or a narrative lattice to help people gauge and help people see how difficulty happens and how we kind of come out of difficulty like the image for example of the emperor which either falls into drunkenness field in theoden style right and and kind of is uh is is gone or goes into hiding and becomes a hidden seed aragon style aragorn style right so you have these two images of the of the lost king let's say one which is fallen into dissipation and one which is kind of this hidden seed which you can't see yet but you know that at the final moment when it becomes important the the the sprout is going to come out and going to to to recapture the world let's say like that's actually a pattern of any moment that you break down right like any any breakdown that exists in any society or even at a personal level when you fall into dissipation but then your attention goes into hiding let's say and when when you come out of sin or when you come out of any kind of difficulty that you have those motifs will play out right that they will play themselves out in yourself and so i think like i just want to kind of help people see that the reason why we're talking about this does have a cosmic and historical aspect but it also has a even an aspect in yourself that you can understand as a pattern of manifestation of how things fall down come back up fall down come back up and keep happening all through history and there is a kind of cosmic version of that so anyway so continue on no no you just did a remarkable kind of phillicalic internalized reading of the text which is which is fascinating because in that time of crisis hope arises in the form of this last roman emperor let's say and that can be interiorized perhaps this is an externalization of something as you mentioned that's being experienced uh internally incrementally and you know your your reading of it in relation to theater and aragorn i mean come on this is how you interpret tolkien what talking society this is it you know where's richard um yeah especially especially these days with the whole this whole scandal around the token society it's like we need more we need more we need more than the zodius a little more pseudo-methodius than our talking look 100 because this is existentially meaningful whereas you know anyway let's not go down that road um no no that's that's uh really interesting and i guess uh the same kind of uh distress and desire for renewal comes up again in the west whenever this motif appears because you don't you have in the dark ages a lot of obsessive computation to work out when antichrist is going to return the artists of modena and um uh lotharius of saint armand and others and the years 500 and 800 are identified as uh the beginning of the year 6000 which some people were expecting to inaugurate um it's known as a millennialism so that reign of christ with his saints leading up until uh the final judgment but um of course this was shifted to the year 1000 when dynasty six secrets came up with the anno domini system and you had a lot of expectation but precisely because of the dark ages because people were experiencing at least on the continent and i know that they've been exaggerated the dark ages my my brother reminds me of this a lot actually because um he's uh uh his field of research is um celtic and welsh geography around around this period and so because you know the church was there in the west i'm like of course i know you know but at the same time on the continent you had the dark ages so um that's not withstanding gregory the theologist and all these other great figures uh but definitely because of this experience of a devastation lack of civilization brought upon by the visigoths and the vandals and those who destroyed the western roman empire throughout the 400s they actually want christ to return imminently to alleviate them of their suffering but that's problematic because christ himself says and perhaps is a good juncture to bring this into it concerning the last things what we call the apocalypse or the eschaton or the second coming he says in matthew no one knows the day or the hour not even the son but only the father so if he himself says that then why is it that you know we obsess about when he will come back to transform the cosmos universally when he can be experienced at each and every divine liturgy and the saints already experienced him in anticipation of that final resurrection so if we have confidence in the church look ultimately if we have confidence in the church this there's no need for these but that being said i've never been through um a famine or uh you know uh the collapse of society so i don't know how i'll react you know i'll probably be running in the first to uh to write a you know scribble on something you know he'll be back you know next week at a certain time of the day because i want it all to end the misery at the end but that's that's basically where all of this um uh what gives rise to this uh desperate uh hope for it to be pinpointed it's a hope but it's a beautiful hope that one day he will come we expect that he will come but there's a desperation behind trying to calculate when and how and where and in what circumstances because he himself does not disclose that so you know getting back to the slavonic daniel again written in palermo oh sorry yes sorry i'm i'm muted that's why let me just bring in one image i think um in terms of because one of the things we're showing like we're talking about this idea this image of uh of an emperor let's say that is bringing back order in christ's name you know and but there's also this image of antichrist which is there right in revelation and which strangely comes right after or right before you're not sure so it's very disturbing because you have an image of a worldly power which is which is supposedly restoring order in the name of christ and then you have an image of a worldly power which is taking power and in storing a kind of order in an anti-christian way and so it's like which one is it and it's not that simple because you have a sense in which antichrist is parodying christ and that even the even the you know even the faithful can be deceived so it's like how do we recognize the difference between christ between let's say a holy emperor an antichrist between the holiness something which would which would be kind of a holy order and an antichrist and uh anyways the way that i see it because it seems like even in the imagery of rome that you see in revelation you have a sense in which i've talked about this in my q a recently where there's an image of the beast and the prostitute right and and it said and a prostitute is basically a place where all the nations trade right where all the there's this confusion of identity where all the wasted seed goes into this this one place let's say so it becomes like a place of mixture of confusion and all of that but that's what that's what a prostitute is then you have this image of the new jerusalem and it says in the image of the new jerusalem that the glories of all the nations will be gathered into the city so what's the difference between a prostitute where all the wasted stuff goes into and then a city where all the glory gets gathered into one place and so it seems like that's the mystery or that's the difference and and one of them like in the image of alexander for example like the good version of alexander where alexander rises up you know with his griffins and then reaches up to he comes close to the prime mobile then here's a voice which tells alexander enough go back like you've you you've gone high enough you can't go higher than this and then go go back down like it seems like there's a key in there that there there's a sense in which the emperor that gives his diadem up to christ indeed in the difference of the emperor or the the ruler who wants to gather all authority to himself and wants to be to act as a god in the world now how what does that look like in practical terms it's because sometimes you could you could imagine an emperor pretending let's say or or politically using that that image of himself you know because i'm thinking about let's say even what's going on in russia let's say division of putin for example so there's a cynical vision of putin which is that putin is using the church to to reach his political goal and there's a less cynical version of putin which is putin is genuinely wanting to incorporate christian value and christian let's say rule in russia so it's like is it both is it one is it the other it's hard to discern that it's it's hard to discern that but i think in relation to the church and this goes not just for the circumstances that you mentioned in russia but throughout orthodox countries and uh extending back to the byzantine period the church is meant to witness to christ in the world for the salvation of the world it is beyond the world we have no lasting city here but our citizenship is in heaven that's both in the epistle to diagnose us and harkens back to st paul um nevertheless within this world there has to be an engagement with it and that can take a political artistic philosophical literary whatever means in order to accomplish this drawing of people to christ i think when one sees and let's say an explicit testimony to christ in the world that draws people within the within or into the sacred space of the church to participate in its rhythms and the sacraments because the church is the body of christ then that's a good thing even if if someone is doing it cynically and it leads to that outcome god brings about that outcome that is still a good thing and we that kind of harkens back to what we were talking about in relation to the martyrs from a certain point of view it's horrible because our massacre from another point of view they become intercessors to christ for each and every one of us and they reign with him forever and ever so from their point of view saint euphemia actually said this to saint paecios because she appeared to him what 30 40 how long ago 50 years ago she appeared to him after he was in treating her do you know the story so he had been entreating saint euphemia um because he wanted to know how it was that she solved the impasse in relation to the fourth ecumenical council in relation to the condemnation of mere physicism or monophysitism that christ only has one nature which would have substituted his human nature now in the council of chelsea and in 451 the church uh affirmed that christ has two natures he is fully divine and fully human um in one person in the office in one person in two natures in the office he means in two natures divine and uh and human uh as uh he's fully god and in that way he's able to save us from death and he's fully human so that we might participate in his victory over death she wasn't fully human we couldn't participate in anyway saint fema performed a miracle um he had been praying to her he heard a knock on his door in the door of his cell um he ignored it because there was no one else around and then he turned around and he saw her standing inside his cell and in order to test her he asked her to venerate the trinity with him and she did that and then in the course of their conversation he asked her how did you enjoy your martyrdom and she said to him something like if i knew all the glories that came afterwards i would have allowed that martyrdom to last a lifetime or something this is a communique let's say from a third century saint because she died during diocletian's persecution to a modern saint uh so you know bad circumstances good and again if the circumstances uh initiated by a ruler uh lead to participation in the life of the church ultimately that's a good thing that's whether you're talking about constantine or anybody else there's a cynicism in relation to that that comes up again and again um especially when people are let's say preoccupied with the sins of a particular people or or group um in the world um you know there are there are certain junctures at which the church cannot compromise not trying to in relation to morals and it should prophetically castigate the world when it behaves in an evil manner uh but ultimately if people come to the church to venerate the icons and to be conditioned by the life of the church if it leads to their undertaking uh introspection and repentance and and all of the things that we experience as orthodox christians then that's a good isn't it that's my only answer i i don't know if i if we can dwell upon that uh no i think i think so i think so i think what fascinates me like in terms of the image of let's say the sleeping emperor and this idea of a return of an emperor which will serve christ as it's collated like that is right next to the image of antichrist or a kind of antichrist vision of an emperor to me there's something to me there's something in this duality which fascinates me which sometimes i wonder if it has something to do with the very ambiguity of rome itself in the history of christianity or the idea that rome is both the beast the but also then the conversion of rome ends up being an image of the new jerusalem whether or not there's a sense in which like when christ talks about how the wheat and the tares are growing together right where that there's something of that where there's something of civilization which becomes a vehicle for the glory of god but nonetheless contains in itself always the problematic problematic aspect of the lineage of cain let's say right the dark aspect of civilization that those two kind of continue on until the eschaton to exist together until they're finally solved in a cosmic way i'm not sure it helps in terms of practical i'm not sure it helps in terms of sometimes knowing what to do in in a practical sense but i think that at least conceptually it helps me to understand why these images seem to always kind of be next to each other let's say in in in the imagination of people yeah the the uh rome is multivalent in other words civilized i mean saint augustine might uh anticipate the the difficulty because he says something like this in his city of god the church is in the world and the world is in the church and they will be intertwined until the eschaton which is the wheat in the tears example being interpreted there so how this uh relates in a spiritual sense to the to the christ antichrist dialectic let's say and how that's transposed civilizationally well the church is always above each and every respective culture and civilization because it is ultimately christ's transcendent kingdom which takes on the forms and modes and morality modalities of uh the world to a degree you know we enter physical buildings that are built by people icons are painted by people but god's providence is always active there and through tradition passes down the holy spirit passes down the way things are done in the church in a very secure manner from generation to generation so the church is one thing it engages with the world constantly but the world is another thing and the church can take the good from the world and interpret it in a positive way and use it but it also has to reject the bad in the world and even prophetically denounce it and that's a complicated thing that i think can only be judged as you mentioned on a case-by-case scenario by those who have discernment namely the saints and i'm not one of them so i don't know i mean you know but yeah at least it's a call for us to stay vigilant in terms of to kind of have us a certain vigilance and also it's almost like there's a sense in which sometimes we're overly cynical of of the the of the reality of the state or the reality of how christ can manifest themselves through through authority and then sometimes we're overly enthusiastic about that right and so it seems like those two people seem to slip into those two extremes constantly in the history of christianity and that ultimately what we would need is more is a a kind of balanced vision where we are capable of seeing christ the fruits of christ in manifest themselves through authority but also be cynical enough to not be to not confuse the emperor and christ himself let's say something like that or not confuse the state with god and god himself look i agree with that i think you've nuanced it there because you know it's like be enthusiastic about christ but know that in the worldly circumstances you know he might permit certain circumstances to be that way for a reason and what we might perceive as good might be genuinely genuinely good and intended as good or it might be bad but he might bring it about to a good that we don't know about yet so it's good to almost even you need discernment and that's hard that that's what the saints have like i can't i can't even begin to to understand uh what they see in worldly circumstance where they say for instance uh you know something that looks terrible just wait and you'll see how it'll turn out down the track you know that's um that's a charism i think that that the saints are endowed with um in relation to the final emperor uh motif and and it's it is a a deviation it's not eschatology which is you know the uh the way that we formally define the study of the end times from which in greek is a plural noun meaning the last things um it's not the last emperor motif is relegated to a subdivision we don't expect this christians a final emperor to come we don't we we expect the king to return the lord jesus christ but you know in times of distress this motif appeared again and again and there was perhaps nothing more distressing than the fall of the city of constantinople the queen of cities so do you want to jump to uh constantine paleologos i think so i think like we've been going for almost two hours so maybe we can go to constantine and then and then and call it call it after that so maybe talk a little bit about about this kind of final image that appears at the fall concentrate poland and we'll yeah okay um jonathan uh well there's a lot to say i know sorry there's a lot to say so you know because it goes back to let's say um the circumstances that are conditioning the empire from the 1200s you know after the uh constantinople is sacked by the crusaders in 1204 three uh kingdoms spring up in uh nicaea in emperors and in trebezond of those three it's the empire of nicaea that makes it back into constantinople and initiates the paleololos dynasty which rules until the fall of the city in 1453. before that during the the empire of nicaea within the empire of nicaea which is in asia minor just before the last great dynasty there was an emperor called saint john vartazis and saint john vartazis who was known as saint john the merciful he's the saint in the church he's after the city was reconquered in 1261 by the byzantines it was uh the michael paleoloros after the laskorids who went in there and took the city the relics of saint john vatachis were taken into the city the incorrupt body of the saint and it was believed that he was sleeping um and that one day after the fall of the city that he would also wake up to reconquer the city so the the motif of the fall of the sleeping emperor appears uh also in relation to this king but it's crystallized with constantine paleologus now constantine palullos was dealt a pretty uh poor hand in relation to uh you know when he was born in other circumstances maybe he would have done wonders because he was a brilliant tactician a great leader um his his older brother was john the eighth paleologos uh who in 1438-39 went over to ferrara florence to broke up the union with the roman catholic church which was militant at the time as we know and this was done in order to bring back support for the byzantines who had now been encompassed by this stage by the ottomans the ottomans had taken thrace murad ii the father of mehmed ii who conquered constantinople in 1421 um he took um idirni adrianopol which he renamed it didn't he which is in the race and made that his capital so a stone's throw away from constantinople so it was surrounded all that was left to the empire was the city itself and the peloponnese in greece in southern greece the more and constantine in fact kicks off his career in the moria in the peloponnese he becomes the despot of mistra which is nisbata and it is there within that framework which was a place of letters of veridition the seeds of the renaissance were there that he um first sean as a leader and in the [Music] 14 early 14 1440s so after the failed reunion council ferrara florence because when john the eighth came back saint mark of ephesus refused to sign the the documents of the council refused to accept it because it was a unilateral imposition of roman catholic doctrine which considered heretical onto the orthodox church without discussion without so the people rejected it uh and that caused a lot of tension in the city which plays out up until the fall of the city plays out up until the fall of the city constantine then um you know he he doesn't make uh his uh let's say view of the union of ferrara florence uh known he gives a lot of time to the anti-unionists which prompted a later historian to say that he was only pretending to go go along with it what's interesting is this um they did manage to get the initiative for another crusade uh comprised of poles transylvanians and burgundians to attack the ottomans as that crusade was moving through eastern europe constantine as the despot of the peloponnese in misra takes his chance to extend the boundaries of misra into mainland greece and to take back little principalities that since the fourth crusade belonged to the italians but there was a prophecy in relation to the border between the peloponnese and attica in corinth separating the gulf of current from mid and northern mainland greece is a six mile wall known as the hexamelion and there was a prophecy that said that this six mile world hexamillion would be built four times and the fourth and final time that it would be built it would last forever you know the first time was during xerxes the second time uh you know the battle of the persians in ancient times second time was during justinian's reign it was rebuilt then the third time was during um uh constantine's father manuel paliologos he rebuilt it but each time it was demolished constantine rebuilt it in the 1440s and that was seen as a fulfillment of a prophecy that's his first foray into prophecy and then he extended himself beyond the moreau when the ottoman sultan murad after he defeated that fourth crusade and discovered what constantine was was doing he came back smashed the hexamelion and basically undid all of his work it was very tragic uh constantine was appointed emperor after john the eighth died and basically had to oversee um uh you know the empire in times when uh which would lead to the ultimate conquest of the city in 1453 on may 29th let's jump to the final months of the city because that's when we get a lot of apocalyptic imagery emerging so um [Music] there is a desire on the part of constantine to get western help so he um actually performs he allows for the performance of a union liturgy catholics and orthodox together in a sophia in the cathedral church believing that that will well that was the term set upon them by rome that if they showed that they had accepted the union between the roman catholic church and the orthodox church that they would send over a crusade what they did get was a former byzantine um what was a visiting a bishop who became a roman catholic carbon with the council ferrara florence isidore of kiev rock up with 300 archers for constantine at the time was better than nothing further help does arrive from the west not in the form of the crusade a mercenary named justiniani longo the genoese mercenary justiniani giovanni justiniani longa arrives with 700 soldiers so that encourages the emperor even more all the while the correspondence with mechmet ii who wants to take the city is floundering um and we don't have to go into the reasons why that's the case in the spring of 1453 mcmet's forces between 60 and 80 thousand strong marched from ebitda towards constantinople and on april the 11th the ottomans attacked the city walls with cannon fire in mid-april an attack on the landwood wars was thwarted by the romans in the genoese working concert compelling mcmahon to turn to a naval strategy and that's when if you imagine constantinople as a peninsula um a promontory surrounded by three sides of water with land wood walls on its western side they got the ottoman ships which were in the bosphorus across the northern tip uh across the uh the golden horn from constantinople there was a piece of land known as pera or galata they managed to get 70 vessels over land and put them into the golden horn which was just off the northwood walls of the city and that happened uh around the 18th of april to the 22nd of april so beginning of the end let's say for the city uh on the 16th of may on the landwood side of the city sappers were creating underground trenches to reach the outer walls and these were discovered and destroyed by the byzantines and on the 19th of may a turkish siege tower was repelled and then there are the portents now i don't know what to make we have to might have to discuss these because these are very interesting on the 22nd of may the moon was eclipsed and on the following day at midday on the 23rd the icon of the mother of god she who leads the way was processed around the city for the lattice protection but a terrible thunderstorm broke out and the icon slipped and fell from the frame on which it was mounted and the procession was then immediately abandoned in fact the sources say that they couldn't lift the icon up that an invisible force was keeping it pressed to the ground on the 24th of may that's the next day after the procession this city was enveloped by a thick fog until the evening when a red glow was seen on the dome of aya sofia the main cathedral of the city we've discussed it before uh and a glow this glow rose to the peak of the dome of the sofia and disappeared and this is recorded in both the byzantine and ottoman sources what do we make of this i mean what do i make of what importance in general or of those importance in particular importance of these potency i mean they're pretty they're pretty they're pretty obvious i don't see like the idea of the of the sky becoming red or the moon becoming red or the idea that this is related to death somehow um you know you hear that in lord of the rings once again where it says you know the sky is red means that blood was shed today or whatever uh i mean i think that these porns are are very intuitive you know the idea of the icon that falls and cannot be cannot cannot uh be lifted you know it's not a it's not that um there's nothing mysterious about the importance in terms of what they of what they signify you know we saw there have been recent importance like that that have been pretty astounding if you think of for example pope francis trying to release two doves for the peace between russia and ukraine and then one dove and both dove being attacked in in the sky by a black bird and a white bird you can see you can find their pictures of it there he releases these two doves by a young girl and a young boy dressed in blue and red it's almost like this image and in the release of the doves and then one bird gets attacked like a crow and then the other bird the other dove gets attacked by like a seagull and uh and and it's like yeah there's not gonna be peace between russia and ukraine it's like it's one of those it's one of those things important happened i don't know what to say it happened this is the thing this is the thing uh because you know while i i ask you uh to provoke conversation you know i'm not trying to put you on the spot but yeah because while of course i don't believe in the myth or the legend of the final roman emperor i believe everything that we've discussed about christ um and the saints but you know uh here i have no trouble accepting these importance because this city was so inundated by relics the presence of holy figures we know that you know what if there were unnamed saints in the city and this is what we know happens in such circumstances when god's uh beloved um under threat uh it happened in relation to saint john chrysostom when saint john chrysostom was exiled from constantinople on two occasions the first time an earthquake um occurred during his first exile during the second exile aliadoxia again rule occult stuff but in relation to the the female empress she died and i think the the cable church mysteriously was set ablaze so you know these things happened in relation to to constantinople and um the fact that uh these signs were corroborated by both sides that's that's very interesting anyway um and on the 28th of may so after the portence um uh and again you know you can understand this given the what was taking place uh uh everybody gathered in sofia and um put aside their differences and um they they celebrated the liturgy together and when um when constantine communed and asked forgiveness for his sins from the people and left to do a final inspection of the walls a terrible moaning and wailing was heard a very very moving stuff when you read the accounts the final siege began on may 29th at 1 30 a.m um there were three waves of attacks on the landwood walls with cannon fire as well the turkish cannon bombardment began at the saint romanos gate which is basically in the middle of the landwood walls you can find a gate against a a map of constantinople and you will see in any good map where the saint romanos gate is um the sultan sends his irregular troops to attack the land with walls but they were cut down by the byzantines and after two and a half hours of slaughter met calls them back at 4am a second wave of troops and anatolian army many of whom were former christians were attacked and also repelled and at 5am the third wave janice series made up of former christian uh boys converted to islam these with the janissaries uh and trained as the sultan's elite guard was sent to attack and these were the basically the hard hitters the emperor constantine led the defense which seemed to be holding ground at this point one of two things happens one before the other there is at towards the north of the landwood walls a gate known as the circus gate where some of the german soldiers under giovanni longo the bukiardi brothers were undertaking skirmishes of the walls and back in and they had forgotten to close the door so uh some of the ottoman soldiers uh rushed in and were able to put up flags on the ramparts at the um at the northern side of the theodosian walls at around the same time uh justinial justiniani longo who's fighting with constantine uh around the saint romanus gate uh he's he's mortally wounded and it's he's been wounded a few times these people were fighting uh sleeplessly for days uh and he he asks constantine for the keys to the gate behind them because it's a three-tiered wall theodosian walls um so that he can go back into the city in order to get mended and constantine gives him the keys and his soldiers the genoese they take him away but then other genoese were there think that he's retreating right think that their people are retreating so they leave and they leave the romans alone uh to fight at this spot on the saint romanos gate and here the accounts vary we don't know what happened to constantine paleologus um some people say that he threw off his regalia at this point this moment knowing that all was lost and threw himself into the fray others say that he was trampled um by the on rush of ottoman soldiers um some say that he uh you know had a few um jewels with some ottoman soldiers and uh was uh killed in that way that he was decapitated uh during uh during the jewel or that his body was discovered afterwards and decapitated or that he was buried um in a mass grave and the way that people identified him one or two people identified him was because they saw the purple boots of the roman emperor would wear we don't know what the reality is here and they don't have there is people don't have his body no yeah his body does even though um uh there were many uh people who believed that he was buried in various places so some people later on said that he was buried in the gul jamir which was once the church of saint theodosia which the feast day of which is the 29th of may so it's one of the late ecumenical patriarchs who refers to the belief so not necessarily that he himself believed it but the belief is in the 1800s that constantine is buried in the because there were certain turks and romans would go there greeks would go there and uh and uh venerate his tomb um there was the uh there's a belief that uh he a small non-descript grave in one of the regions in istanbul is described as being his grave uh as believed as being his grave again so the people who are writing about it they don't actually believe it by edwin uh augustus grosvenor who was a american uh historian and uh tutor in constantinople for a while right now i think he was a pastor in one of the protestant churches and while he was tuning in constantinople uh in the 1800s he would see greeks going to a a grave in a district known as um where is it in constantinople and this was put to an end by the ottoman authorities and he himself says in the description that this was not his grave uh the turkish accounts all have him uh let's say uh being um presented in one way or another to the sultan like he's been decapitated his head taken to the assault on something after his death but we don't know the legend quickly arose however that um he's not dead that he was plucked from the spot by an angel and taken to the golden gate but he was put in the subterranean cave um this is the subterranean cave is important in terms of the seed that i talked about before the idea of the the emperor's ship moving down into a seed form where the king vanishes uh but like like i said vanishes in invisibility but then but then is hidden in the earth like a treasure or a seed that it will sprout again later but yeah that that's that's analogous in terms of the symbolism that's right i mean um and this this image emerges within the next century in laments that are written about constantinople and the final king so these laments uh form part of the popular folklore and um and literature but there's a few interesting things that are recounted about him in relation to uh they look exactly like some of the motifs that we discussed earlier just to bring everything full circle in relation to the tibetan cereal pseudomonas methodius and the slavonic daniel it's called the sylvanic daniel i didn't mention it before because that rendition of the pseudomethodius with uh which is transferred to daniel the prophet only exists in a slavonic version that's why it's called the saronic daniel but um there's this one lament that talks about constantine just before the city falling seeing um a queen entering a church of the virgin now constantinople was considered protected by the virgin mary the invincible champion from around the 7th century onwards and he follows her into the church and she sat on a bishop's throne and looked very mournful then she opened her holy mouth and addressed the emperor this unhappy city was dedicated to me and many a time i have saved it from wrath now too i have entreated my son and my god but alas he has decreed that this time you should be consigned to the hands of your enemies because the sins of your people see it's the same kind of reflexive and uh introspective way of viewing things blaming oneself for the calamity instead of one's external enemies which is the christian thing to do we're meant to love our neighbors so we're meant to love the turk and the italian and the roman catholic and everyone else so i say that to mitigate any possible objective that will might come up in the comments you know it just happens um so i've been treated my son my god but last year's decree this time you should be inside the hands of your enemies because the sins of your people have inflamed the anger of god so leave your imperial crown here for me this like fourteen hundreds fifteen hundreds seven hundred years after slavonic daniel you know and it's come up again in the byzantine context leave your crown here for me to look after until such a time as god will permit another to come and take it when the emperor heard this he became very sad he took his crown and scepter left by the last roman king who was asleep and woke up after his defeat of gog and magog and the ishmaelites at the foot of gold arthur he leaves his crown inceptor at the feet of the virgin i know it lays them on the altar sorry and he stood in tears and said my lady since for my sins i've been bereft of my imperial majesty i resign also my soul into your hands along with my crown so he's relinquishing his life to her the way that the last roman emperor would relinquish his life at golgotha in the previous texts um the lady of the angels replied may the lord god rest your soul in peace in the company of these saints the emperor made obeisance and went to kiss her knee and she vanished and her eunuchs who are angels vanished with her but neither the crown nor the scepter were found where they had been left for the lady the mother of god took them with her to keep until such a time as there would be mercy for the wretched race of christians how epic is that yeah definitely that's amazing that brings it all together and you know uh what's very interesting donald m nichol who translated the text that i just read to you uh he goes okay so that was in this book the immortal emperor which is the book on the legends of the last uh king of the romans constantine palullos the lady he says takes the crown and the acceptable of his sword what a constantine by the law of lululus's sword well a 19th century italian ambassador to constantinople named tekko claimed to have it in his private collection of arms and to have taken it from the tomb of macmitt ii in 1866 a delegation of the greek or roman the romney community from constantinople presented a ceremonial sword to the danish prince constantine heir to the throne of the helenes because the greeks were ruled by german-laded kings from denmark you know and uh on the occasion of his coming of age claiming that it had belonged to constantine the eleventh value laws they even referred to this new constantine as constantine the twelve so this had um a long i never heard any of that that's that's mad it's all in here actually when the new greek state was founded after the um uh the hellenic independence in 1821 in the 1800s and it's the 200 year anniversary of that this year so that's um that's also very interesting because the modern greek nation um was founded uh uh by people who you know cannot saints heroes but they were they were very much interested in the celebration of orthodoxy publicly and so that's all very interesting but you know they went looking according to a reference in this book um they went looking for an heir i don't know who went looking some of the representatives of the newly formed government for an heir of constantly by laws in the west but couldn't find one and there were many people who claimed to be heirs in the west and in the east when there's a whole trajectory outlined in this book but i think that's very interesting concerning the sword uh and concerning um uh uh the kind of afterlife of this uh belief in the final king which we saw was popularized in the folk songs that we mentioned at the beginning of of uh our talk um uh you will come like lightning and that's actually very in that particular song which is a beautiful song and i can send you the links maybe you can put them for people to listen to he conflates imagery that's associated with christ with the emperor so you will come like lightning you know um uh you will bring light and all these sorts of things it's just uh it's very interesting um uh do we have time for i think i sorry if we have time for what for one more reflection here let's have one more reflection all right go for it okay thanks sorry we've gone for such a long time it's really fascinating stuff but so but yeah go for it it is thanks jonathan thank you for your your patience for this um the historian ducas relates the following in relation to constantine's column and this again harkens back to the apocalyptic literature from earlier centuries because the slavonic daniel speaks about the last emperor yes he's aroused from sleep and everything else well not right from sleep he is discovered sorry through divine revelation divine revelation discloses him in the slavonic daniel in the text written in the 800s in in sicily so he wasn't sleeping but he's poor he's like a pauper king now dukkha says the following concerning the fall of constantinople um when the turks broke in this is a historian writing in the 1400s the christians rushed to aya sophia the great church and that's what happened monks and nuns men and women carrying their babies and abandoning their homes the street was packed with people making for the church the reason for their stampede was this there was an ancient and false prophecy that the city was destined to be violently captured by the turks who would slaughter the christians as far as the column of constantine this brings it back to our talk from last time the column uh the from the point from which constantine began construction on his city as we saw at that point however an angel bearing a sword would come down and hand over the sword to an unknown man a very plain and poor man standing beside the column the angel would say to him take this sword and avenge the lord's people that's this pauper king manifesting now from the 9th century transposed into the 1400s so this literature was alive and well in concert that's amazing because that's so close to the image of arthur who takes the sword from the stone without knowing what's going on and nobody knows and he brings the sword anybody's like what what what does this child have the sword and he's he's revealing secretly that he is the the future king yeah that's right the symbol of the power and might of the sword well this is something that of course it bifurcates it kind of goes east and west like this you know yeah yeah i mean that's another topic in itself and so so this popper who receives the sword next to the ends up being the hidden emperor let's say uh that's the implication because he will then chase them to monodendrion which is where the red apple tree was which we talked about the beginning of the talk um either at the borderlands between byzantium and uh the ottoman empire or where the turks came from or the arabs depending on when you which text and when it was written um so yeah that's that's then the new final emperor let's say um this poor picking so you know they had a long lifespan these uh these uh myths and legends of the final well thank you so much i think that maybe i want to add one last thing before we end it's mostly for people to to be able to pull back from all these stories and to on the one hand understand that we don't always have we don't have to see these stories these tropes these patterns as happening explicitly in the way that some people might expect them to happen or not happen but we need to be able to understand them as valuable even in their most even in the most folkloric way that they appear we need to be able to understand them as valuable as manifesting patterns of how things happen and the way in which they are captured mythologically and in legends can help us nonetheless have insight on how things go away and how they come back how they come back for example the image of the idea that hidden in a popper is the king it's something you see in fairy tales all the time that you have this imagery of the golden ball which falls to the bottom of the the pond or all these imagery of a value being hidden in the field and then being being found by in a surprising way you know hidden in something and so all of these images can help us understand how reality works even if we we have to be careful not to become not to become too enamored by them so that we start to to to become obsessed and because you see that right you see people become obsessed and start to see like what the science and the science and the science the world will manifest itself in science and we will see the signs of the time but we have to be careful not to become too literal in the in the bad sense and and remember for example i keep wanting to remind people that when it says in the old testament that elijah will return before will come before the messiah that that elijah was john the baptist and that really is how that pattern ended up manifesting itself now for a literalist at the time it would have been very frustrating for them to hear christ say well yeah elijah did come it's john the baptist and it would have been very frustrating for them to see that but for someone who's able to kind of pull back and understand these as these kind of the way in which the world kind of lays itself out in these patterns uh it becomes it becomes at once less dangerous and more insightful for you to be able to see how it is that reality unfolds so so that's my last i don't know if there's a last thing you want to say on top of that i think i agree with everything you just said and you know the um the stories themselves are tragic too and they give some sense of hope to people who were suffering i mean this is um what we see unfolding in each of those contexts and you know this you know it's these these stories because they gave comfort to subdued and subjugated people uh in the 7th century in the 9th century and in the 15th century they're benign more or less unless we become literalistic and uh you know preoccupied with them to avenge ourselves on aries we're meant to love our neighbor love our enemies in imitation of christ and we can take the good from these stories as well so you know you've got even deeper by saying that you know the expected outcome might not be uh in the literal sense you know the final king or of the antichrist or how or whatever motif that we touched upon tonight it might come in a way that we don't expect and that's a very deep way of reflecting upon that and i appreciate that um the symmetry is interesting this is a last just because i forgot to mention it some of the writers uh around the uh this period they say two things they say that uh the city itself uh its fall actually saved orthodoxy because of the fact that um the imperial court that had gone under rome dissipated and the paradoxical putting of all of the orthodox nations under the ecumenical patriarchate uh which was considered a um a millet a kind of like a ethnaki uh that had contained within itself all of those people that ascribe to the same religion through which the patriarch would be responsible to the sultan and vice versa that providentially preserved orthodoxy because the serbs and the bulgarians also were going over who attempted to go over previous centuries to catholicism to get military help so that's this that aspect but the fall of the city had a positive outcome for the church there's another aspect that there's a symmetry between the founding of constantinople and its fall in terms of the fact it was founded by constantine who had a mother named helen and it fell with the constantine whose mother was named helen she changed her name to ibomoni when she became a monk saint pomoni but that symmetry is eerily mirrored by the old rome which was founded by romulus and ended with romulus or costales so there's a pattern there that was made manifested twice and that confirms i think uh what you just said jonathan yeah all right everybody well thank you for your attention and i hope this will be this is food for a thought and you know we'll put in the resources more resources obviously in the links for people to look into this and uh and yeah and and symbolism happens even in the most even in the most historical sometimes tellings of the story and you know it's like to remember that the city falls through the circus gate is something that we all need to remember right now in our world of dilapidation correct that's right so thanks for thanks mario thanks for your time pleasure pleasure really thank you
