ladies and gentlemen the ultimate title that you can achieve in the game of chess is grandmas it's the highest possible distinction meaning that you have a full Mastery of the game I suppose you can make a technicality and say that becoming the world champion is another title but officially recognized title is Grandmaster and I'm not a Grandmaster uh I have a long playlist on this YouTube channel of my trainings that I did when I made a comeback to tournaments I have since retired for various reasons that I've talked about at length and if you're even confused about how to become a grandmas you can find that in another video I did some years ago that's not the point the point of this video is that sometimes I have really good chess days we all have really good chess days sometimes other days are horrible I'd like to share both the good and the bad with you and yesterday I had a really good chess day where I performed at a 293,000 level on chess.com like a strong Grandmaster would days like this make me want to come back uh to competitive chess maybe I will at some point in the future and one of these games actually was against a world champion Contender whose name is gakamsky who I have played a couple of times probably been featured a handful of times in my videos 2846 2880 2860 uh were the levels of my opponents as well as 2941 so we are going to look at a bunch of these games you're going to learn a few things and I'm going to show you some uh a lens into my emotions good bad and ugly some of these games were horrendous so you'll get a chance to uh to learn from that too so I was playing against a Polish player Mighty GM Pretender who I suppose pretends that he's a Grandmaster his name is um Antonio kak and uh he's a 2440 Fay rated Untitled player so his International rating is 2440 he has no title and he played the modern defense against me with G6 I played something super goofy the most principled way is of course to put two pawns and maybe you could even put three pawns and put a knight and try to attack I played like this cuz I was actually hoping that he would turn the game into a Sicilian Defense and then that would be like an A3 Sicilian which I do play quite a bit th this is fine but it's not considered the best way to play and then I definitely played it in a way that's not the best way to play because here instead of developing a night and castling and doing all of this I waited for him to Castle this is actually a way that if you go try this in your own games if you develop your pieces in a way where you wait for your opponent to Castle and then throw your Your Flank Pawn forward it's actually pretty lethal and so here I played H4 and the idea is just to play H5 and you know there's other ideas like going here first taking the Knight so it leaves control of that square and people are really bad at defending themselves against these attacks which is why I always tell people play H5 okay play H5 all right my opponent did not play H5 and instead tried to Target my Bishop so I kind of left the pawn there but then I played H5 myself and you might be wondering but what about the knight in the pawn yeah what about the Knight and the pawn well the idea is I'm going to sack my Rook I'm just straight up going to sack my Rook now normally this is a very bad deal but actually here you can see the computer says it's it's in the balance it's because I have this bishop my queen is lurking around the position I'm down two points and yet the position is in the balance and that's because I'm going to get some very quick development on this side attacking possibilities when I Castle long my Rook will come join my queen on the H file so what does my opponent want he wants to trade Queens if the Queens come off the board right now white is dead lost so he goes here now I'm monitoring the queen trade I quickly develop my knight to gain a little bit more control he goes here now like I said if I take the advantage is massive now it's not completely lost but it's a very very very bad decision to do that so I get out of the way I don't trade the Queens I want to go here here bring my rook and then I want to bring in my Knights I want to start plugging my Knights into the attack cuz I have a very clear plan of action right so he goes here in this position I thought it was a very bad idea to trade because I figured when I did he would take secure Center control and activate his Rook by capturing with the pawn every time a pawn moves in chess you got got to think about what else is being affected now that would have been a very bad decision by me but a good decision actually is this crazy kn2 move rerouting the Knight immediately not worried about moving the Rook I thought that was a little bit demented uh but uh apparently that that that is not the worst idea in the world I didn't do that I decided to just quickly castle and just say you know what if you take me I'm going to move my knight out of the center like that but uh but I'm going to be but I'm going to be okay now what's really crazy here here is that I did not need to take at all I have a zishan zuk an in between move in this position which is including the move Knight H4 threatening the queen and the point is if the queen tries to defend the bishop now I go Knight F5 and apparently apparently I'm winning like I don't understand but apparently I'm winning if he moves The Rook I can go here here and uh Queen G3 and it's mate like it's it's insane but mate comes out of nowhere yeah I I didn't see any of that I did this and then I played Knight H4 anyway and we just kept building the pressure he push my Bishop back but again these pieces are going to come back into the game because I'm I'm going to play G3 I'm going to play Rook H1 I'm going to use Pawn breaks to get rid of the blockade and reactivate my pieces so that's what I did I put my knight on F5 he went here I played Queen H5 which I thought was a nice idea if Knight takes F2 he gets my Pawn but his his Knight just dies so he gets a pawn Pawn like a lot of people here especially the beginners would say I take a pawn and I attack a rook that's so good no it's not cuz he just moves The Rook you got to think like what is your opponent going to want to do and I went G4 we traded and I again avoided a queen trade and I was ready to bring my Rook now at this point I realized this is a tough position this blockade is really powerful and if we go to an end game The Rook versus the two Rooks is really going to be felt cuz I have a knight but it can't really get into the game so I going I'm going to need to rely on Pawn breaks I'm going to need to break the center apart so I targeted the queen I don't have a rook pin to the to the queen so I did this I'm looking at Knight F4 I'm looking at routing my knight that way I'm looking at D4 I got to break apart the center quickly okay so I play D4 all right we're both down to about 30 seconds I'm trying to pry the defenses apart Rook G8 I take I take and now Black's position is a little bit more more fragile so I play Queen H5 I'm not threatening mate but I'm immobilizing the queen I'm making it very difficult for him to offer me a queen trade right or Target my position he goes here I go here now I'm threatening something really lethal I've got pressure I've got pressure and actually I am threatening Knight takes F4 in some positions the point is he can't take because I would deflect the queen away from the defensive mate so that is my major idea I also have to be very careful because there are checkmating ideas on G1 take take is May but I can block I don't actually have to take the queen when it arrives Queen G1 is crazy so what I do in this position after Rook D7 is I played B3 and I made sure that my King was always going to have an Escape Route he played Queen G4 and so now I played a move that I thought was really good which was Queen H6 he had to defend himself and stubbornly like play like this but he blunders he blunders under the pressure the best move here was to take take and actually play F3 removing the defense of the pawn but I was not in really a queen trade mindset I thought there's no there's no reason I should trade the Queens but I have a tactical justification which is that I got this he can't take and then I'm all right I have a knight and a pawn for The Rook which is which is very decent and I have ideas like Knight E6 and the position could get very bad very quickly so the best thing to do is actually to make a draw to just repeat moves because my Bishop has to you know there's this but then there's Rook d8 um so there's actually Rook C7 sacking the rook and then winning the night that's crazy but my opponent uh played this bishop G7 and he hung mate in one but I was happy with this game because it was a very interesting way to play and I I actually suggest this for your own games if there's positions where you can wait for your opponent to Castle use that H pawn attack especially against the fian ketto bishop and then don't trade the Queens bring the queen back and slowly build up some attack it is very very very tough to defend as you can see from this game now this game was the opposite this game was not a goofy uh opening uh it was actually just an opening success I played against uh I always find this person's username hilarious because stolen has one L so technically this person's username is pronounced Stalin Monster uh but it's I think it's stolen monster so I E4 this a 2900 rated player uh from Russia I believe and I played a ponzani which is crazy like ponziani at 2900 level not supposed to work opponents are all supposed to know Theory very very highly recommended uh opening I have an opening called best beginner chess opening ponzani very well could be he went here I played the mainline Queen A4 pinning the knight uh to the king and now black either has to defend the center or know this tricky line where they give up the pawn completely it's a free Pawn but they attack my queen with the bishop they take and then they play things like Knight F6 Bishop D6 and and you know black is fine according to the computer but after you develop like D3 castle castle white is just the pawn up like the computer thinks it's equal for black if you play aggressively and play F5 but my opponent went here and I know that's not the right move because what that move does do despite getting the active Bishop is it doesn't secure the center and actually the bishop is a target for me because I'm up a pawn so I'm happy to trade pieces the reason why the bishop needs to go to D6 black wants to avoid exchanges black wants to activate pieces but not trade so what do I do I play all the ideas of the opening I try to trade the Bishops I finish my development he castles and then I castle and the opening is over and I am still up a pawn right so now I'm like oh man I'm up a pawn against this 2900 rated player so my opening was a success in chess you have checkpoints in the game you go do I did I forget the opening did I play the opening correctly yeah I played the ponziani exactly how it's supposed to be played now my opponent goes C6 and now it's a matter of simplification so what I have to do is simplify in the correct way if I take and activate his Bishop for him that's the wrong way if I keep the tension and play a move like Knight E4 which is the best move now I'm threatening this this eyes on that and I'm going to trade a few pieces if he takes me which he did I'm going to UND double my pawns so my D pawns now become d and e and I'm just a clean Pawn up it's not even a double Pawn the whole argument previously is that I have a double Pawn it's not doubled anymore he plays King h8 and now it's like well now I have to just not rush he plays King h8 to get off of this diagonal this is a very instructive move sometimes when you're you saw last game right I was down material so I had to attack attack attack but sometimes you're down like a pawn and sometimes you're down a pawn in a position like this which is very sterile there's not a whole lot going on so he gets the king out of the line of sight of my bishop and now with my queen there he's going to create counterplay with F5 so I I still have to be careful because I can definitely still blunder here and I started getting a little bit nervous you'll notice I have a I have a Time Advantage watch what happens to my time I got so nervous in this game Pawn takes F5 I don't you may be wondering why did I take and allow The Rook to take cuz just cuz they can attack you doesn't mean they're going to win you you can centralize everything is safe just ask yourself can they take anything no Bishop D3 is coming with pressure and made ideas this is a very bad position for black so he took with the bishop I slid the Queen off the line of sight of The Rook he went here which is a good move I should have traded faster I should have taken on C5 faster I traded and then I just brought my second Rook look at the time look at the time I went from 138 I spent 30 seconds on that move that's crazy that's my nerves that's my nerves kicking in right he takes I spent another another 11 seconds on that move then I quickly took which was easy then I spent 25 seconds M now I'm down to 33 seconds so I am actively sabotaging myself because I'm so nervous I'm like oh my God he's going to get my queen he's got this and this and then he's going to mate me I'm seeing ghosts That's What's happen happening I'm seeing ghosts right but I'm also looking at things like wait a minute The Rook hits the bishop and the pawn right and what if I play Bishop A7 and then Queen A7 Rook D6 and then I was like wait a minute then there's Queen C5 which is which is a you cannot end your calculation on your move right so instructive moment in the game if Bishop takes Queen takes Rook takes does that mean that I play that no cuz you got to think can my opponent do anything to me Queen C5 is a fork so I'm like okay Rook E1 he goes Rook F6 I'm I'm terrified at this but I play Queen H4 I'm down to 30 seconds Queen C7 I spend another 10 seconds I'm down to 21 seconds on the clock I get a little bonus time every time I make a move but I'm trying to trade he declines to trade but now his Bishop is stuck and I'm going to just very slowly unwind here okay Rook G6 I I I get a little closer with my queen now I make sure that there is no discovered attack I 15 seconds on the clock but I'm lucky because despite all of this he has no threats Bishop F4 I go Bishop C5 attacking his Rook I go here and then I force a bishop trade and now I'm completely winning like it's no longer a question not only am I a pawn up he has a ruined structure so it's going to be just a matter of time until all my pawns swarm my pieces swarm the pawn rather Rook f8 I take take rookie for two pawns up two pawns up dominant position but six seconds on the clock the way you win this with white is you quickly simplify you get a rook off the board you make sure you don't get mated he went here he's trying to snipe my Pawn I I brought my pieces back I defended all my pawns he goes Queen B5 I play Queen E4 check Queen E4 check is like a like an Impulse move because you're like I got to give a check and then I went here so now I have no Pawn weaknesses all my pawns are defended but he goes here I'm nervous I'm going to lose my Rook so I now I play Backwards why did I play back it's just a free Pawn this is a third Free Pawn completely free everything is defended but I I went back Rook F5 now I needed to defend my F Pawn so I played F3 I got 4 seconds on the clock he goes here I centralize and now here I'm like okay I can go back but that's a free pawn and I blunder I blunder Rook takes F3 and the game is going to be a draw I can't take the Rook because he actually gets a Perpetual check and I blundered a draw I blundered a draw with two seconds on the clock I got nervous I threw the game this is like vintage Gotham but my opponent was feeling generous my opponent got arrogant here and instead of taking the draw for reasons I cannot explain he took my Pawn he was trying to play on my clock he thought I was so nervous maybe he seen my content where I openly talk about having serious doubts and and and mental gymnastics and everything and I and I had to play like this now it is still a dead draw it's still a dead draw it might be Winn aable but he didn't want a draw he did not want to draw and as it started to happen I started picking up his pawns and I've just got more of them so by the time he takes my pawns he's going to lose all of his and with just 3 seconds on the clock I managed to protect my king centralize my queen and now and winning completely winning now I have two passers and my king is going to run that way that's exactly what I did I mean it's it's a but look at my queen defending everything he gives me checks I run my king over here and a very easy way to end this game Queen C4 check Force the queen trade of course I can just advance but Queen C4 check hits the king and the queen I'm going to get my two pass pawns I'm going to go join them he's going to go defend I'm going to go win that pawn promote my H Pawn and that is going to be the end of the game of course I can also just push my C punts I really this was the exact type of game that I always mess up I just panic I get low on time and I and I allow like a trick and I and I throw the game and I it's just crazy because it was such a dominant game from start to finish and and that's what I did now this game I was very proud of I thought this was a very very nice game this was against Kel kukin who I've actually never defeated before I checked our games I was like 0 and4 against him some of those games were a while ago but uh he played the bird um and then I you know I just I just played B6 Bishop B7 I played kind of my my my famous E6 B6 system this game got really weird really quickly because we both fought for the center but here's there there's actually a major flaw with what he's doing and this might be very deceiving to some of you but you know the the whole point of playing the bird right which is what he's playing is to secure the E5 Square secure the dark squares in the center quickly develop and then use that f file use the F Pawn to your advantage to try to create an attack when you start playing and trying to be greedy in the center like this when you push too many pawns forward Pawns in the back get weak not just pawns complexes right so here the very simple Pawn takes D4 made me realize oh he's in a lot of trouble already because he created too many openings for my pieces he did not develop his pieces fast enough even though he's 2860 it's so like sometimes that's what happens and now rather than give the check first I play Knight E4 and it's like when you hit a ship in Battleship you can choose which side you're going to go to next Knight E4 sets up irresistible danger to the position he plays Knight C3 because he kind of has to like if he plays this bishop B4 he can't blocked the check he has to move his King up which is miserable so what he does is he plays this and now Queen H4 is okay but believe it or not despite that like he could get a position where he loses his rook and he's actually not that much worse and I realized this cuz I was like it's kind of nuts that I can play Queen H4 and he can like give me this and then just like take and he's not even losing cuz he can quickly create counterplay against me and I I noticed that and and I and I focused on that side of the board my idea was just to quickly Castle but then he then he undeveloped his night and then I was like you know what Knight C6 and here's my idea he's going to play A3 I'm going to make him take and then I'm going to shove my Pawn into his position A3 I took remember he's lost a bunch of time his Knight went here here there there he also has weaknesses he has a weak King is he's not castling anytime soon and now it's a matter of do I try to strike at his center with the move d4 or do I Target his Knight with Queen F6 and that's what I did and I'm going to get my Rook quickly on the same file or I'm going to Castle I'm going to get my king out of the center and now it's just how do you attack an opponent who has kind of violated opening principles right who has not gotten his development and now this a very important move instead of castling I'm more equipped to start a fight so I play D4 and now I'm going to pry apart his position piece by piece he goes here which is a nice move I play Queen D7 guarding against Knight D6 and also threatening the pawn here where the Rook had to move to defend the Knight so his whole position is falling apart now he goes here and here and he tries to advance into my position I take once I dart out of the way but he still puts the Knight on D6 and now we continue to try to wreck his position with the move E5 and he's just a move behind he's a move behind I have too many threats against his very very weak King he decides to get desperate here he goes here gives up a pawn tries to Clos the position but he's a pawn down and the position's bad so I give a check now I give the check cuz his King loses the right to Castle now he's a pawn down with a bad position and he has no right to Castle so now it's just a matter of I got to get rid of these guys I got to get rid of these pieces I make sure he doesn't take my my Bishop I don't trade Queens I could have traded Queens but my queen is more active and powerful than his Queen F6 centralized the Knight creating a lot of pressure on his position F3 hitting this now it's just a matter of how do I get rid of this blockade I shove my Pawn forward right we both have like three seconds on the clock here Play Bishop C6 that's mostly just not to lose on time but uh it's actually the top computer move which is nice Rook D1 and now I sacked an Impulse move not the best move not necessary I could just play Rook B8 but I decided to sack cuz I get this and this my Pawn is so strong maybe I'll take this in the future it gave him some chances but I had a really powerful blockade and I've also got Knight G4 on the way so like his King can't escape and this Pawn is an anchor of my position so it's going to put pressure he tried to uh sack a rook back but he just doesn't have enough I'm up too many pawns and now it's just about cleaning house Queen C3 A5 we trade I'm up four pawns now and we win this game by opening up his King and uh the king gets opened up rook E2 we swarm in and that pawn ultimately did thoroughly restrict his position I was very happy with this game because as early as move seven I was actually able to spot the fact that he created too many weaknesses and it allowed me to transform the position in an advantageous way like punishing him for this kind of weak uh weakening of his position early on so this was very instructive I thought uh of how I handled his lack of development sacrificing my own castling desire to play D4 and then later in the day I played a very creative game I was very very happy with this game my estimated ELO in this game was 3,200 this is against gakamsky if you look up gakamsky dude's got a ridiculous ulous resume he played a Sicilian Defense against me and I played this line that I've been playing recently I even made a pretty Advanced course on this like a chessable course on this um so if you're like 16,700 over the board which is probably about 2,000 online 2100 online you can study this course it's it's a very interesting course but the lines that are very high level take take and the idea is white puts the queen back allows this Tempo winning move but this is a major sideline with some very interesting chest that can arise because you get some very creative positions you castle and got played this in a way where he puts the Knight on G6 he tries to fight for the center with the night he will loses a little bit of time but then he played H5 and I played H4 we met on the H file which I thought benefited me took a lot of risk in the beginning B5 and then here I got a little wild I was feeling very confident I had a lot of momentum I could have probably just played like Knight F3 gotten a bit more development maybe F4 F5 but here I took a massive risk and I played Knight D5 and uh that's a very common Sicilian sacrifice where if your opponent's king is in the center just like the last game just like the game against Kil um you can play moves like this that open up the position and the idea is very simple I want to play Knight C7 and you can't stop it you actually have to take my knight probably and now I have the open E file so I thought Knight B4 was the best move but then I'm still threatening Rook E1 and D6 you actually can't stop both you can play Bishop C5 I will give you a check you have to move King f8 and then your knight is still trapped so I'm winning the Knight back no matter what so got spent a little time put the Knight on E5 I took I sorry I didn't take I played Rook E1 first and now I'm guaranteed to to win back the material cuz the king is in the center to my surprise G just gave me material I like I thought maybe he would want to keep the pawn but he said no take the Knight and then take the pawn twoo take take take so now I'm up a pawn I'm actually just a clean Pawn up uh and I thought there's no way he can Castle cuz I play Rook H5 actually apparently he can but you know he I thought he was going to play like something here get his Bishop out but I thought I had a really nice position he plays Queen D6 I develop uh rather I could have developed my knight to defend my Rook but instead I went here and I was actually already setting up some very nasty ideas the point of Queen E3 is to prevent castling so now is Bishop will be under attack if he castles the other idea was that if he plays King f8 he can't move his Bishop because I have Rook E8 made so I thought this was a very flexible Choice by me Queen E3 now I develop my knight now he plays Bishop G4 he wants to take by Knight and so I thought okay I can develop my Bishop here uh and I don't really see any other move right because I need to get my rook in the game I need to play Bishop D3 I need to play Rook F1 so that's what I did I played Bishop D3 and notice different from the other games my time managing my time very well and here I I made a slight mistake Bishop F6 and not a slight mistake but I I actually like it it seems like a mistake but I had an idea and I'm super proud of this idea and it's the top recommended idea of stockfish my position is so good and my king is so much safer the f file is a Minefield for the black king also Black's lack of castling is preventing The Rook from getting into the game quickly so I had an idea here if got plays Bishop F6 I'm not backing up in fact if he wants to create danger to my Rook I am going forward now I threaten rookie a check winning the queen if he takes I go here now I threaten mate if he goes here then I win the game with Bishop E4 or Knight G6 so he can't do that so then I don't know what he's going to do okay I don't know what he's going to do I don't know how he's going to try to defend himself with Rook F1 coming right that's that's my idea now here you went here so now Rook E8 doesn't work because the queen is protected and he's really trying to take and he's trying to get his rook in the game if he can get that rook in the game it's it's a it's a devastating position for me but here I found rookie one rookie one recreates the threat of rookie eight because now I have backup so he can't take me with the King rookie eight I would take and then I would take the queen or I would take the queen first so now he has to take me he has to take take take and he is under a lot of pressure a lot of pressure now what's crazy about this position is let's just say it was something like uh A5 King B1 like I know I'm I'm just saying if this is position white is winning but my King's position because I never spent a move on King B1 G has a defensive move here in fact it's the only move otherwise I have an overwhelming attack otherwise black has to go here I play Queen D4 I play Rook F1 my position beautifully coordinates to swarm him where material doesn't matter because his King is so weak it doesn't matter that he's up a little bit of material but got here finds the critical idea Queen H6 and he's threatening a queen trade so I cannot M him but what I can do is utilize the pin while I'm pinned Knight G6 check his King cannot go to the file I actually cannot take the queen because then The Rook gets out of the way I can't take the Knight I can't take the Rook with the Knight because he takes my queen but what I do have is Perpetual so we repeat moves and that's that's as good as I can do all right as good as I can do um and you know Queen H6 was the only defensive move he had to force a draw otherwise white would have had a very powerful attack maybe I would have messed it up later maybe not but he plays Queen H6 cuz it's the only it's really the only move in the position I was very happy with this game I was very happy with this night sacrifice idea uh and uh the pin and winning my night back and then keeping my rook in the center all right a worthy sacrifice Queen F4 I thought this was super clever and it turned out that stockfish blessed this whole attack and it came down to one square if my king was on B1 Queen H6 obviously doesn't work but that's life and you know uh it's the second time I've drawn G uh and I was very proud of this game so I didn't win all my games I lost a few games as well uh but um overall pretty pretty happy with my performance one good title Tuesday I got eight out of 11 and then in the evening I got seven out of 11 wasn't perfect but it is what it is and days like this make me uh you know make me uh think that the GM title is not not completely over not completely lost so that's all I have for you today I'll see you in the next video get out of here
