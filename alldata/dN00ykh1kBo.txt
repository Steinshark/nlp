250 bucks that's the minimum for a current gen gaming machine and then you need a display and some games and maybe an off-brand controller for your annoying little brother emotional damage can I at least skip the gaming headset what okay all right realistically you guys are right many popular and free games are just plain better when you can talk and interact with other players and realistically all your friends are hanging out in Discord anyway so all right peer pressure I'm gonna open my wallet one more time but what's everybody else buying these days the g9000 pro gaming headset from bengu I've never even heard of these guys and at just 22 dollars they're listing console and PC support based surround whatever that is a dedicated mute switch I mean this thing sounds too good to be true and it looks pretty bad in the pictures so just why the family friendly content is everyone buying this gaming headset Maybe so they can use it for this segue to our sponsor Asus the Asus Pro art pa-148c TV is a 14-inch portable monitor designed with creators in mind with a bevy of ports a physical dial and industry-leading color accuracy your creative side is sure to thank you check out the pa148c TV down below [Music] from the packaging to the products the g9000 pro could be best described as a little basic with the Box containing no protective foam and the headset itself being made of mostly shiny plastic that feels like ABS the band is flexible though and feels like it should be pretty durable and there's even a thin metal strip to reinforce it the foam is thick enough to keep it suspended off of your brain case though the material choices are decidedly low end and that carries over to the ear cups both for better and For Worse again the foam is thick but it's quite firm which means it could easily create pressure points especially because the ear cups themselves can't be repositioned the cover is a synthetic leather material that again feels durable enough but isn't breathable at all so if you weren't a sweaty gamer already you will be now the biggest issue for me with the ear cups though is that they're pretty small we'll talk about that a little bit more later basically these things feel cheap but unlike the Tommy Hilfiger headset that we looked at recently it's because they are cheap and there's a lot to like about them as well the band size adjustment mechanism it's a little bit finicky but once it's in place it doesn't slip it's got a flip down noise isolating microphone and it features a sleeved cable with a volume control wheel and mic mute toggle that terminates in a single 4-pole gold-plated three and a half millimeter combo Jack this is super handy for console Gamers who plug into their controllers and they also also include a USB port wait what oh okay well uh that's a feature you're never going to use on your console unless you go to the trouble of plugging in a USB extension all the way over next to your TV um so no that USB port is not because there's an onboard deck that is only for the lighting effects though that's not a huge disappointment for me most of the devices that you'd want to use this on still do have three and a half millimeter Jacks and frankly the DAC that bengu would be including for this price would probably be terrible anyway my only real issue with the USB port then is that I have to have the stupid plug hanging off it to power lights that I can't even see while I'm wearing them but hey they're closer to 20 bucks than they are to 30 right now so unless they sound like absolute garbage I can excuse a lot of inconvenience and low end materials they're actually not crap they're not that bad they're not that bad like they do suffer in terms of bass response a little bit but I actually wonder if a big part of that is just that they don't seal that well like if you get lucky and you happen to have a head exactly the shape of the product designer I can already see what you're talking about with the pleather ear cups though your ears are gonna get warm if you wear these for a long time like this this material is not great unlike the GPU plushie from lttstore.com now that's great of course I don't expect you to just take my word for it so we sent the g9000 pros over to our lab and it looks like our subjective Impressions were actually pretty close they are objectively not awful what you're looking at right now is a frequency response curve it represents a headphone's ability to accurately reproduce audio across the entire range of human hearing this dotted white line is our Target frequency response curve and while it's obvious that they're trying to overcompensate for a lack of sub bass and that our upper mids are getting a little lost that's probably what makes them sound a little muddy they're not that far off I mean here are some much more expensive and objectively worse ones from Tommy Hilfiger for comparison and what's really shocking is the mic isn't that terrible either while there are some complaints in the user reviews about it we're going to get to those soon don't worry I didn't even notice when ploof was using this during our weekly writers meeting I mean is it going to make you sound like your favorite podcast host well no but my goodness temper your expectations it sounds okay so then what's the catch with this thing not much apparently it's got over 96 000 reviews on Amazon making it their top seller in the gaming headset category and a whopping 82 percent of those reviews are either five or four stars that is darn impressive however some of the low star ratings contained some valid and even concerning feedback that might make you think twice about supporting this company for starters we found not one but two instances of bengu trying to pay or guilt trip reviewers into upgrading their scores and wherever you see one or two people with the Integrity to refuse an offer like this there are almost certainly many others who took the bribe so who knows then how many of the four star reviews were actually upgraded after the fact pretty scummy so then that raises some questions like who exactly is bengu according to their website they were founded in 2014 then again and they're pretty unethical so who knows and the g9000 pro seems to be one of their Flagship products their mission is to offer customers reliable and affordable consumer electronics products and they are apparently a young team but then so was OnePlus remember when they definitely weren't owned by BBK and then they definitely admitted that they were I don't know there's not really much else about them here they've got headsets mice speakers keyboards and even a wireless PS4 controller all at pretty attractive prices so the company at least appears to be real and aside from that one spicy nugget of dirt that we dug up complaints in the reviews are mostly stuff we've seen before and mostly agree with though some people might have overblown them a bit like some of you absolutely hated the Dual cable design others had issues with the mic or the speakers not working properly that's fair enough everyone can get a lemon once in a while and several of you hated the build quality things like that they're too rigid to tight too small Etc though we saw some grossing about the mic that we thought might actually be user error with people pointing out that it seems to pick up the entire room I mean it didn't seem that bad to me let's give it a shot here I am talking right now into the microphone and ploof is working on cleaning the real house or whatever maybe he's got a vacuum cleaner hey there you go yeah woo I don't know I'll let you guys be the judge I do think it's possible that buddy accidentally had their laptop mic active or something like that the two and the three star reviews are a lot more of the same but mostly just from people who aren't quite as mad about them there were some added complaints here though about the cable getting wrecked and twisted over time the poor quality of the ear cup cushions and most importantly an issue with hearing others talking during gameplay this last one actually makes a fair bit of sense considering how bad the top end looks in our frequency response graph here with that being said most of the four and the five star reviews seem to indicate that people can hear clearly so this could be a hint that the performance of the g9000 pro varies a fair bit from one unit to the next for those of you who are wondering we purchased Ours from Amazon so it's not a golden sample or anything but we did only buy one so your mileage may vary moving into the high star reviews but most of you seem to love about these things aside from of course the incredible value is the same stuff that we did the volume control the mic quality the durable construction the sound isolation the cable quality and the Comfort there are some patterns in the complaints here like the ear cups are a little small and the quality could be better but one user put it I think pretty well when they said my seven-year-old doesn't know any better and doesn't need any better yeah they are a little on the small side for some adult ears that is unless you like on-ear headphones but for younger Gamers I think it's fair to say that these are perfectly adequate the Pinnacle of mediocrity or are they a lot of products are perpetually on sale to make them seem more premium and the g9000 pros are no exception thankfully bengu's own website has enlisted for just 29 thanks for nothing Amazon you deceptive and even on Amazon you'll usually find them for anywhere between 26 and 22 which is what we paid and at that price man I don't know it's kind of tough like if you up your budget you can pick up these GSP 300s from epos uh these are currently just 32 dollars and use considerably more premium materials than the g9000s these ones don't really look it but that's because they've been daily driven for about three years and the cups are finally starting to fall apart but from the plastic to the cloth to the pleather it's all a pretty significant upgrade for just ten dollars more I mean there's no cool blue LEDs but instead you get volume adjustment on the side of the ear cup the mute mic is on the flip down so there's no need for your cable to look like it swallowed a Hot Wheels car and the cups are significantly larger and they swivel a bit which could be quite a bit more comfortable depending on your ear size and placement meanwhile if we go lower in price meanwhile if we go lower in price it's honestly mostly just kind of junk these red dragon h101s are straight up listed at 17 bucks so there's no phony baloney regular price credit to them for that but while they will get the job done they sound worse and feel even cheaper than our bengu best seller super light with a plastic only band and with all the same Comfort concerns but even more so benue might not be the most reputable company but at least you know that if you don't like them you can probably just write a bad review on Amazon and get offered freebies or some sort of compensation we'll have all these headsets listed down below bottom line then bengu not bad especially for the price but if you can afford to save up a little bit more or you want to treat yourself or someone you know to something significantly more premium I would recommend grabbing the GSP 300 instead they have a similarly great rating on Amazon and come from a much more reputable company like
