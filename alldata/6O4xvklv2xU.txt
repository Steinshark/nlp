pixelmon was sold as the greatest nft game ever they promised the largest and the highest quality game the nft space has ever seen that's the promise that investors spent 70 million dollars on the hope for a virtual metaverse where you can play with friends battle and trade pixelmon and more the founder was anonymous which is always a good sign this guy cyber he told people pixelmon is the next blue chip this is financial advice don't do your own research and oh boy did people listen zero research was done and 70 million dollars was raised at a price of roughly ten thousand dollars per jpeg now what do they have to show for it well we've been waiting patiently here at coffeezilla and finally the team revealed their nft artwork who is that pixelmon [Music] i assume they modeled him after the average nft investor and brace yourselves because it gets much worse bulbor uh you know get it a a light bulb with with eyes ten ten thousand dollars guys ten thousand dollars and also we have bormon now borman i've gotta tell you guys is my favorite because he has the same expression i had when i realized people paid ten thousand dollars for this now off rip let's be honest with ourselves this looks bad actually that's being polite it looks horrible we've regressed in time this looks worse than gen one pokemon back in 1998. i mean need i remind you back then you could spend 30 on a finished game that you could play with your friends now in 2022 nfts have come out and people are trying to charge you 10 000 for an unfinished game where the only friend you can play with is kevin and nobody likes kevin now unsurprisingly pixelmon have already lost 90 of their value which is still way overpriced but many people might be wondering how did this happen how does this keep happening every week i feel like we're reading about the same story and as the internet detective i'm here to explain it for you guys but i also have to credit two guys zack bxt and kobe on twitter who helped document this meltdown go give those guys a follow but now let's answer the question what went wrong most of pixelmon's success is because of a game demo that was given before launch which looked kinda good there wasn't a lot to it the demo lasted like a minute and was only a basic world but you have to understand in the world of nfts even the smallest amount of effort makes you seem like you're the next mark zuckerberg which is why it basically sold out despite some noticeable flaws but given how ambitious this project is you might wonder who's behind this who's the founder who's going to execute on this dream of pokemon meets metaverse meets nfts because as the saying goes it's the man that makes the project and in this case that man is a boy his name is martin and he's 21 years old and in charge of 70 million dollars now we have to pause here a second and appreciate 70 million dollars that's aaa game funding like you could get a blizzard or activision game with that and instead it's been spent on someone with zero experience which i think personally is an interesting experiment because already i'm playing 70 million dollar games made by competent people and i hate them i'm kind of curious what happens when someone who doesn't know what they're doing gets in charge of that 70 million i mean could it get worse well according to early reports yes for example this investor minted his nft and literally got nothing he didn't even get a kevin he got the minecraft default cue and i've got to say right now that's probably the only thing i would have paid ten thousand dollars to see the look on this guy's face after seeing this concept art and getting this he says quote thanks pixelmon i got an invisible character worst mint of my life at least give me a character i can't even give away this now i know that looks bleak but to be fair to the pixelmon team they're saying that look that's just the nfts the actual game is going to be way better because they're going to outsource that work to an actual game studio magic media but if this is their plan to outsource the work i've got to say things are looking pretty bleak i mean it's kind of like being relieved theranose hired a blood scientist to help make the tech work it's not exactly a vote of confidence that all the actual work is being outsourced i mean the problem remains the leadership the massive promises just having tons of money to throw at the problem doesn't mean you'll succeed millions of startups get funded and fail every year what makes the difference is the idea and the leader which in this case are both mediocre but of course you might be thinking wait a second there is another option the founder could just return the money which investors asked about can we be refunded the response is classic crypto no that's not how the space works over promise under deliver that's how this space works right so you might be wondering if no refund is coming how does a 21 year old with no experience build something no one's ever done before well the answer is simple you just go steal work from people who've done it before see apparently some of the sneak peeks of pixelmon were actually just stock assets on the unity store like this snake which can be found for 159 dollars here's another example of the founder looking for this baby dragon he wants to use another guy sources it and he says oh yeah haha bought that yesterday now i want to be clear the pixelmon team claims they didn't use these assets for the actual nfts but instead paid artists to modify these assets slightly which isn't really that much better especially considering that some of the artists that were hired didn't even know their work would be sold as nfts for example this guy who designed some of the dragons said i don't actually endorse nfts because exactly this other people get rewards for the artist's work and he's right he made six thousand dollars designing dragons for pixelmon and pixelmon made 70 million dollars now not only that remember that this whole thing is supposed to be getting designed by some aaa game studio magic media that actually has the experience but so far that isn't what's happened at all in fact in some of the models you can see upwork which is a freelance website listed in the save file so apparently part of the 70 million dollar game you guys just bought is being designed by freelancers who might not even know if their work is going to be used as nfts and all this just shows the inexperience of the founder he's rushing around trying to fulfill impossible expectations and the result is exactly what you'd expect a mangled mess of stock assets freelance work and botched art but to be clear i don't think the founder holds all the blame here pixelmon doesn't seem like a rug pull the way a lot of nfts are it's a terrible investment absolutely but that's not the same thing as a scam where people just run away with the money that actually hasn't happened yet instead the situation is you just have a 21 year old inexperienced developer with a 70 million dollar war chest and i think that's kind of on the investors they're the ones who put millions of dollars into a game with zero credibility and that isn't out yet and honestly i don't think there's a good answer for this i mean i think it's on the people who wanted to get rich and decided to gamble because it's fine if you want to do that but when you lose it's kind of on you now of course i'm sympathetic to you guys so i'm not going to leave you guys hanging if you lost money on pixelmon i do want to help you guys out with a friendly tip there's actually an open world game called pixelmon as well that is out today you don't have to wait for it and believe it or not you can play it even if you're broke because of pixelmon because well this pixelmon is free and comparing the two a free game which is already out to a 70 million dollar disaster i think the only reaction to have here is this so that's basically it pump the stock by liking and subscribing see in the next one
