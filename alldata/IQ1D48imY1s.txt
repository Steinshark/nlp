so apparently Rich Harris wants to Fork JavaScript okay the truth about svelt I have been deceiving you all oh by the way I really like Rich Harris I I actually I should have just had him on for this but that would we'd have to like align schedules and take like a week anyways I've uh I had you believe that svelte was a UI framework unlike react and view Etc because it shifts work out of the client and into the compiler but a framework nonetheless yes yes because he also doesn't uh do this pedantic masturbation about his react to the library or framework uh but that's not exactly accurate in my defense I didn't realize it myself until very recently but was felt three around the corner it's time to come clean about what felt really is sveld is a language it's fair it's fair specifically svelte is an attempt to answer a question that many people have asked a few have answered what would it look like if we had a language for describing reactive user interfaces a few projects have answered this question Elm imba Idol Marco and probably more I I don't know this one ideal ideal is that supposed to be ideal is that ideal or ideal I don't know I can wise I can never pronounce a y you never even know Maria Elm uh ideal is an outlier as it's geared toward a specific use case rather than general purpose app development uh but I think it qualifies as an example I actually really like these type of things that are trying to solve a specific problem as opposed to trying to create general purpose Frameworks I do think there is something to that that's really really uh that can be really really good these projects are very are all very cool but there's a reason why they haven't hit Mass adoption they want to control the entire world you cannot adopt Elm or IBA uh imba uh incrementally and they do need a dedicated tooling far beyond just a compiler itself I EG syntax highlighting unless you're uh unless you like your code a monochrome this is good this is dude this this is such a good point this is exactly what I have my problem right now with Zig which is the tooling is just not quite there great language great Concepts seems like a real true spiritual successor to see but tooling ain't it yet right in some cases Elm stands out to interrupt with JS ecosystem and is less than seamless yeah beyond that they have a steep learning curve which is hard to justify when there are so many uh options that are more accessible Thinking Inside the Box what if we had a language that was designed for building reactive user interfaces but also worked with your existing tools what if you didn't need to discard all your years of experience with hitmal CSS and JavaScript because it was uh because it extended those languages it would extend HTML by adding JavaScript expressions and markup directives for controlling behavior and reacting to input syntax for conditionals loops and asynchronous values it would extend CSS by adding a scoping mechanism that kept style styles from clobbering each other it would extend JavaScript by making a reactivity a language primitive that's what the dollar signs for this is actually really good bridge is very very smart and I effectively if he handed me Kool-Aid I would just drink it I do love HDMX though but I could also love svelte I feel like svelte and htmx are are the two that I could love uh how do we make reactivity a language primitive without introducing invalid syntax or breaking the relationship with existing tooling like typescript by hacking existing syntax this is another reason we read this yesterday and I know it'll be on YouTube shortly which is talking about the ecosystem of JavaScript and why svelt is so amazing because every single Library doesn't need a wrapper when you're using svelte it just works it's felt just works oh you have a library well guess what you don't have to go through all the rigmarole of making it work with react you just simply go import Library use in spelled right like that's a very beautiful thing it's like inverted to react react you import react wrapper of said Library chart JS react and then you use chart.js react to render it out because that's the only way to do it whereas was felt you import chart.js you set your data to charge JS you use the docs for chart.js and you write charge as right that's way better how do we make reactivity a language primitive without introducing invalid syntax or breaking the relationship with existing tooling like typescript by hacking existing syntax people are saying well what what about uh solid.js solid.js in some sense suffers the same problem which is that you ultimately in the end need all these wrappers and it doesn't quite work the same way you know when we instrument assignments to variables and properties so we add a dollar statement yeah this is just a label labels are completely valid JavaScript that's the best part they're not introducing new syntax they're using available syntax a little uh known label construct that's how you break out of an outer for Loop if you have two for Loops you use the label and you can effectively go to uh that whenever the their inputs change value we tie it all together with an opinionated scheduler uh this to me is the best of all possible worlds we can lean on Decades of accumulated wisdom by extending well-known languages author components and delightfully concise and expressive way and yet still generate apps that are bleeding edge in terms of performance and everything that goes in it always bet on svelt always bet on Rich Harris I think Rich Harris is an incredibly incredibly incredibly smart person right very very uh I'm very impressed by everything he always does um okay where are some of the later comments do we have some later comments okay so this is actually older than I realized but this is it's still completely beautiful because when they said spell three I was like I thought they're on spelled four uh he's the real lawnmower he's a real lawnmower honestly that man's a lawnmower I don't want to read the comments the comments are all stupid but this is actually really really good which is the thing I really love about this is that it introduces svelte allows you to do a bunch of things kind of in like this one file and then it kind of compiles everything together but still at the end of the day you're just using HTML you're just using CSS you're just using JavaScript right and they have all built-in like tools that just makes it nice I just really like it I think it is really the best thing and I think the obvious answer of why it's good is truly when it comes to the library importing and the problem with react I think that truly should be the biggest thing that kind of gives it away which is if you want to use something and you have to wrap it you have to add additional complexity you have to do this constant adapter layering then maybe what you're building isn't the right abstraction right it's a wrong abstraction it's an inverted abstraction because a good abstraction does not require continuous adapters a bad abstraction requires continuous adapters right if you want to use anything and you have to adapter it something is wrong something has gone wrong somewhere I'm not saying it is the worst I'm just saying there should be red flags things should be popping up in your head going what's wrong anyways I really like spelled I really like Rich Harris the name I like feltagen
