you know I had a vision of Heaven at one point um it heaven was a place where people were eternally playing and it was a place where everything was good but everyone was playing to make it better yet so it was a combination of what was really good but that wasn't the end of it and maybe that's because being itself is not good enough you want becoming as well right you don't want things to be static and perfect you want them to be as good as they can be but Dynamic so there's still something to do and so you could play at making things better and better and that's that would be lovely if that was true right if you could have what you wanted if you really think it through you might think well it would be lovely if everyone could play a voluntary game that everyone wanted to play that was aimed at making things good but even when they're good the aim was to make them even better and then it would even be better if when you were doing that it was marked by a sense of what would you say a profound sense of positive engagement and the cessation of negative emotion and one of the other things we do know about play is that it's quite disruptable by other motivational States so it's not that easy for children to play if they're hungry or tired or anxious or upset or hurt if your children are playing spontaneously it's actually a Mark that what you've created around them is a Walled Garden right the walls protect them so there's not too much chaos and uncertainty and the garden is is this place where things can flourish a playground is a wall Garden in in any you know in any real sense wall Garden Paradise paradesa means wall Garden by the way it's a balance between culture and nature or between structure and possibility you could also think about a wall Garden as a game because a game isn't you can do anything you want a game is here's some principles rules you might say here's some principles by which you can govern your behavior within that set of principles here's some play right some freedom to maneuver not so much that you drown and no one knows what they're doing just exactly the right amount so that it's playful that's how it looks and so back to treat yourself like you are someone you're responsible for helping well you want to approach other people in the spirit of play but I would say even though you probably shouldn't teach people to play with themselves so to speak um it's the right attitude to bring to bear on yourself too and that's a hard thing to do you know like we tend to think that most people if we're cynical we think well people are rather selfish they're self-centered they only want what's good for themselves it's like first of all that's actually not true there are some people who will routinely take advantage of other people to get what they want in the moment but that's pretty rare in its extreme forms which would be psychopathy let's say in its extreme forms it's never more than about 3% of people and then around the Psychopaths there might be another kind of cloud of narcissists who are inclining in the same direction but haven't got quite so far and maybe you could add another 5% on that you know depending on the severity but that's it's just not the case for most people most people have the reverse problem they treat themselves worse than they treat other people and why well why would you do that well you know maybe you treat other people not so well because you think they deserve it and why would you think that well cuz you know things about them aren't as good as they could be uh and you know that they've made mistakes they've they've walked off the pathway they've done things they shouldn't have done and so you don't treat them as well as you might otherwise but then you know that about yourself more than you know that about anyone else right you have privileged access if you want it and even if you don't you sort of have privileged access to the entire panoply of sins that you're responsible for and that's a lot you know and most people bear a pretty damn heavy burden of existential guilt and some of that isn't warranted you know lots of times you see people in the Freudian sense who have a super ego that's yelling at them too vociferously you know one of the things you do in therapy for people who are hyper conscientious to the point where their own internal voice is a tyrant is you try to moderate that and and so people can call themselves out on their misbehavior too much but even if you don't do that generally you have quite a lot of misbehavior and as a consequence of that you're ashamed and uncertain about your own value and so then you don't think you really need deserve to be treated very well and so then you don't and one of the things you do as a psychotherapist is well what a lot of what I did for example people sometimes would fall into a situation where they were being terribly accused of some misbehavior by maybe in a divorce case or maybe at work and I would help them mount a defense for themselves it's like you know we have the presumption of innocence right which is a complete bloody miracle that presumption it's it's such a miracle that that our legal system actually starts from that perspective because be so much easier just to say you're accused of something hell there's 20 million people in the vicinity we don't need you maybe you're guilty off with your head that's way simpler than despite the fact that 40 people are coming after you with accusations we have to assume you're innocent God and it's very hard to do that for yourself you know to mount a defense and one of the things I used to have my clients do if if they're in such a situation is write out a defense it's like treat yourself like you're innocent just for the sake of argument we can also do the same thing on the guilt front you know maybe you should make a case when you're in trouble about why you're guilty as well as why you're innocent to lay out the whole territory but at least you should defend yourself and then we might say also if you think other people are worth taking care of if you think that if you think that other people have value well they're individuals like you and it doesn't seem all that plausible that they could have value and that you don't unless you're the worst person around and you're probably not I mean you're bad enough but on average you're no worse than everybody else maybe in your worst moments you know you managed to climb to a new Pinnacle but generally speaking you know other people are carrying a fair weight to guilt around on their shoulders too and so if anyone has value then you do so what would happen if you treated yourself that way and this is a dead serious question and it isn't a matter of thought [Music]
