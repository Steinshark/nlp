when i was just starting out as a documentary filmmaker i read and watched everything i could find online about how to improve my skills and get better i taught myself a ton just by watching youtube and actually that's a big part of the reason why i wanted to start my own channel so that i could give something back to the community instead of just being a consumer but what i found is that no matter how much i learned when i got out into the field and started shooting for real i still made mistakes messing up here in my office is cringy enough but doing it in front of a whole film crew can be horrifying in a perfect world i'd like to never make a mistake on a shoot again but when i look back on my career making mistakes has taught me lessons that i've never forgotten and if i hadn't made them i'd probably be worse off now so in this video i'm going to go into five of the most common mistakes new filmmakers can make and how you can avoid them on your next shoot hey guys welcome back and if you're new here my name is luke forsythe and on this channel i teach the skills i've learned over 10 years working as a documentary filmmaker and photographer okay so you're ready to shoot your next documentary project and you want to do the best job possible and not make any stupid mistakes the first thing i'd say is not to expect perfection and to try not to get too frustrated when things inevitably go wrong because that's just part of the process but if you can at least focus on getting these five things right you're gonna have the best possible chance of having a smooth shoot if you haven't watched any of my previous videos before i come from a stills photography background i was a photojournalist based in southeast asia before i ever started shooting video and now as a dp or even as a director it's natural that i give priority to the visuals beautiful imagery can really up the production value of your story and in my opinion it's always worth trying to get the best dp you can find to shoot your dock luckily these days camera technology is so accessible that there's no reason for things to look bad and i'm sure for the rest of my career i'm always going to be pushing for the best visuals possible in any project i do but the picture is just one half and arguably the less important half of your story in documentaries it's audio that forms the backbone of your story you can hide bad shots by cutting away to something else but without clean audio there is no way you can move the narrative ahead and while people might be willing to sit through shaky or badly exposed shots if your story is really good if your audio sucks people will lose patience right away and that's the first mistake to avoid when shooting your first dog not paying enough attention to your audio i was as guilty of this as anyone when i first started in fact early on i was hired to interview a famous politician for a huge tv network that you've all definitely heard of and it turned into a massive disaster because i ignored the audio basically i spent so much time setting up the frame that by the time i started miking the guy he was in a rush and i had to do it really quickly so i clipped on a lav mic as fast as possible hit record and then sat back in my chair to check focus for the rest of the interview that was only when the interview was done and i got the footage onto my computer that i realized how badly i'd messed up because of where i put his mic his silk tie was rubbing on it for the entire interview and basically none of it was usable i should have been monitoring the audio the whole time through headphones and i should have also never left so little time to get it set up properly in the first place i sent in the footage and i got paid but i never heard from that production company again and i knew it was because i did such a bad job if at all possible these days i push for a dedicated sound guy now i know that's not always in the budget especially when you're just starting out but i can't stress how important good sound is to telling a documentary story if you do find yourself shooting something without a sound guy just make sure you've got a pair of good headphones all the time so that you can be sure you're getting good clean sound from all your different mics the next mistake to avoid is a classic for people like me who come from a photography background in video unlike stills you need a huge variety of shots from all sorts of different distances in photo you're often looking for that one decisive moment that tells a story in a single frame but in video the story takes shape in the edit afterwards and you'll need a ton of variety to tell a good story and cover up all your editing points and that's the second mistake you should avoid not shooting a wide enough variety of shots on one of my first jobs the dp i was working for told me that no matter what i was shooting he needed me to get him a wide a medium and a tight shot every single time that advice has stuck with me throughout my career and it's saved me on more than one edit it can be really easy to find a good frame on a character and then just want to hold that for an entire scene but what you need to be doing is covering a scene and that means getting different stuff for the editor to work with the easiest way to think about that is by following the advice that dp gave me all those years ago get a wide a medium and a tight of everything if you can the wide is your establisher the medium is typically your main shot and the tight shot is for details and cutaways it's always a balancing act between making sure you cover the important action rather than just constantly changing shots but that's where your audio will cover you and you can keep the story moving forwards even if the camera is changing position so when you're shooting try repeating wide medium tight wide medium tight wide medium tight over and over wide medium tight and you'll thank yourself when you're editing later speaking of editing it's really easy to get caught up in the moment when you're shooting and forget all about the person has to sit down in front of a computer and put it all together not thinking about how you're going to cut your scenes together is a really common mistake that i used to make all the time and it's the third thing i try to avoid on your next shoot if you want to become a better filmmaker and tell better stories thinking about the edit as you shoot is going to be a huge help imagine you're filming two or three different scenes in a day one inside one outside and one in a bar maybe how are you planning to transition between those different environments how are you going to show the change from day to night how are you going to explain to audiences that one scene is over and it's time for something else this is where thinking like an editor comes into play do you need to shoot a few time lapses before you wrap or maybe it's as simple as letting your character clear the frame before you cut so there's a convenient edit point to work with when you finish a scene you need to ask yourself how are we going to get out of this location same goes for starting a new scene or introducing a new character you need to visually signal to your audience that you're changing gears or the story will be hard to follow there are a million ways you can do this but thinking about the edit as you shoot not after is going to make a massive difference i've sat in front of adobe premiere pulling my hair out so many times cursing myself for not getting a shot of a character walking out their front door or for not grabbing a quick shot of the moon to show the transition into night you can't fix these problems in post so make sure you get them on the day and you'll be much happier later now that's going to help make your post production easier but what can you do before the shoot starts when making documentaries it might seem weird to think of writing a script because how can you script reality don't you just go out there and start filming everything and then make sense of it later i used to think that as well but that's the fourth mistake you can make over the years i've learned the hard way that not writing a script ahead of time is a recipe for disaster a documentary script isn't the same as a hollywood script where every single scene and piece of dialogue is set in advance a doc script is more like a rough plan of what you think might be the best way to tell your story and what scenes could help to tell it if your doc is about an athlete for example it might be a good idea to get a scene of them training maybe another one of them in a game one or more at the after party and then maybe something at home to show what kind of a person they are away from their sport from here you could think about what times of day might work for those scenes then create a schedule and work off that this is a documentary script at its most basic and it gives you something to fall back on when you're not sure what to do next a doc script should be one possible version of how you might tell this story if it were totally up to you it's a guide not a rule book and the most important thing about one of these scripts is that you allow for it to change whenever the story dictates it it's not like you write up a script and then force your characters to follow it because then it wouldn't be a documentary your character should tell you where to go and what to film next but the script will sit there in the background and help push things in the right direction whenever there's a lull because believe me at some point everyone is going to look at you and say okay what next and since you probably have limited time with your crew and your characters you need to have an answer so take some time and write out a basic version of how you might like to see the story unfold and then allow it to change as you go the last mistake i'm going to talk about today is probably the most common one new documentary filmmakers make when they're looking for a new project and if i'm being honest i still struggle with this myself we hear about something in the news like i don't know cyber bullying and we think hey that's a great topic for a documentary and you're right it might very well be an important issue but a topic alone isn't enough to tell a story and that's the last mistake i'm going to touch on in this video choosing a topic and not a story pretty much every story ever from the odyssey to star wars to shrek follows the same basic structure it has a beginning a middle and an end a story starts in one way and then after a series of events or changes ends in another luke skywalker goes from the dirt farm to blowing up the death star shrek goes from a hated monster to getting the princess and a good documentary should have the same levels of progression a story doesn't have to have a happy ending but you'll need something to change over time usually from the perspective of a character if we go back to that cyberbullying example if you just film a bunch of experts talking about the issue with some b-roll in between it's going to be a pretty boring film there's no beginning middle or end it's just a summary of how things are now this might work for an academic report or something but in film people want to be told a story so when you're choosing the subject of your next film ask yourself do i have a story here is there a beginning a middle and an end are there characters who want something and change over time if the answer is no you need to go back to the drawing board before you start shooting so there we go five mistakes you should avoid when shooting your next doc i have personally made every single one of these mistakes before so it's totally normal but if you can work on fixing each of these issues one by one you're going to be a much stronger filmmaker in the end hope that video was helpful and if you like that maybe check out this one on one of my biggest failures as a filmmaker see ya [Music] you
