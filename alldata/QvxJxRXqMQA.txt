if you look at the tech job market today it certainly seems like this is the end of the self-taught programmer companies don't seem to be hiring selft developers anymore they seem to want everyone to have a bunch of experience already which is of course impossible if you have no experience because you need to get experience to get experience etc etc for the past 5 years we have witnessed a modern day Gold Rush of people jumping online and learn the code as the resources to do so become more and more accessible and the job demand for programmers was skyrocketing but it would now appear that the Gold Rush is over as even people with computer science degrees seem to be struggling to get hired in the job market which sure makes it seem that if you don't have a degree then you cannot possibly be competitive anymore so is this really the end of the self-taught programmer well not really let's calm down let's look at the situation logically what is really going on is that with AI and everything improving really the bar is just Rising as in you need to be better and better and better to today if you want to be able to land a job in the industry but as long as you're aware of a couple of things that you actually need in today's market to stand out you can absolutely still get hired even above people who have degrees if you don't have one yourself but before we get into that and exactly what you should do today to stand out based on my research and based on what I have seen work right now we first need to understand how we got there as well as the psychology of tech companies that is making it seem like they are no longer hiring selfo developers or even Junior developers and also how you can get around the situation so the field of programming was not always like what it is today for example right now I'm reading the biography of Elon Musk who actually in his early days was really into programming and code and all of that and the way it is described it really sheds light on what programming used to be it didn't used to be this industry with these high paying jobs and all these tech companies and all of that it really just used to be the kind of thing that the tech geeky nerds at universities somewhere who actually had access to computers because not everyone even had access to computers those days would do on their spare time to like code up some game or hack some weird thing like they were not the cool kids back then that they are today but everything started changing around 1969 when the internet came about so the internet significantly changed the software World in many different ways and eventually in the late 1900s and the early 2000s this spurred the creation of companies like Google who started creating these really scalable and high growing Tech products using Code the world as a whole started seeing how writing code with his infinite scale ability give anyone in the world with the skills to do so the ability to create products for the entire world to consume and so we started seeing more and more technology focused companies being created at the pays faster than any industry in history and the thing about tech companies and Tech startups in general that this is still true today with tech companies is that in the beginning their focus is not on profit their focus is instead on growth which basically just means pouring all the profit that they generate plus all the invested dollars that are coming in into growing the company further and the thing with tech companies is that they don't have a lot of expenses the only major expense is their employees the engineers which allows them to just scale massively so because all of these invested dollars are now essentially being poured just into hiring more and more engineers and because at the time it was actually very difficult to learn the code you probably needed to go through a computer science curriculum in a university or something like that writing code was a lot more difficult because we didn't have high level languages like python which meant that the supply was low and the demand was extremely high for engineers which led to this massive growth in job opportunities for those with the skills to write good code now this was known as the.com bubble but basically eventually many of these companies realized that their business models were never even that viable in the first place so the bubble ended up bursting and there was a massive decrease in the amount of jobs for programmers but the thing is after this bubble in the past 10 to 5 5 years we sort of actually saw a similar thing happening where there was all this positivity all these new tech companies being founded all this venture capital investment coming into the tech industry to all these Silicon Valley startups who now again needed a lot more Engineers that the world could produce which again led to massive increases in the salaries for software Engineers so it's was basically a situation where as long as you just knew how to code you could just basically get a job almost automatically well maybe I'm exaggerating but it was sort of like that the difference is that this time the world was more aware of the value of programming so since like the 2010s the programming industry has been changing in a different way as well coding boot camp started to pop up that basically offered you like a fast track to learning to code from zero without having to go to university and actually get the skills to land these really lucrative jobs at these really big tech companies in fact in less than 8 years around 95 boot camps will be introduced and this essentially led to the democratization of programming where anyone with an internet connection and a laptop could simply learn the code if they wanted to and this coincided with the fact that high level programming languages like python now made it a lot easier to write code in a lot less time which means that it was now easier and easier for a single engineer to produce a lot of Highly valuable code that might have taken like five Engineers to write in the past now this was all went un good until around 2022 when this Tech bubble also started bursting which was spurred by the covid crisis and the general recession that has sort of been happening in the past few years now as again startups started realizing that okay maybe our business model isn't actually that viable and they started basically going bankrupt and as layoffs started happening at the big companies as they realized that oh yeah actually we don't need this many Engineers to produce our products or things like that we were now again in a world where there were less jobs but getting into coding was also much much easier than it was in the past where it has now led to the situation where there is so much more competition for a lot less jobs than a few years ago and hence companies are now in a position where they can simply require people to either have a degree or have a lot more experience already because there's so many Engineers competing for the jobs that they offering and with the rise of AI and things like this it is becoming even easier to write code and even easier for companies to produce the same code with a lot less Engineers so with all of this said how can you actually compete in this market because what I've just told you sounds a bit gloomy but it's not actually nearly as gloomy as it sound the first thing to understand that this is an entirely natural development in two kinds of ways the first thing to understand is that whenever in the world there is some skill or some industry that is really high in demand people are eventually going to realize that and the supply is going to meet the demand as more and more people get into this really lucrative thing and the other thing to understand is that the economy will always go up and down like there will always be these sort of Bubbles and there will be crashes and things like this we just now happen to be in a situation where there's a lot less Venture Capital Money available for tech companies which leads it to be more risky Converse Less jobs available Etc but eventually the economy will start Rising again so what does this mean for you first of all it means that if you now right now start learning the code and you get the skills to get hired once the economy starts Rising again which I think is already sort of happening now I don't think the recession was actually as bad as people expected you will then be in a position to have the skills to get these new jobs which will now start popping up what has simply happened is that what we thought of as a self toop programmer before is no longer in enough today but you can still become a selft thought programmer you just have to sort of learn more and go a bit further than you might have in the past so in the past it was enough to just learn HTML CSS and JavaScript and as long as you were able to like build a basic website or something like that you could probably get a job because that was like a pretty rare thing to know how to do back in the day that is simply not enough today so what most people are stuck believing is a device from 2 3 years ago when something like that might have been enough and that is what is leading them to believe that oh selft programming is dead or something like that when in reality selft programming is absolutely alive and well because companies don't actually care about whether you have a degree they don't care about all these kind of things they only care about one thing are you a competent programmer or not if you want to get hired there's only two things you need be a competent programmer that means actually be good at coding like actually be able to build software and then number two you need to be able to prove that to the companies you need to be able to somehow show to them that you have the skills the psychology of these tech companies that makes them like have these crazy requirements in their job application forms is that they just want to screen for candidates that they think have a high probability of being very competent like in absence of all of the information someone having a degree is sort of a proxy for them being competent even though I actually don't think that is necessarily the case but if you know nothing else about a person them having a degree from a prestigious University shows to them at least that okay they were able to first of all get into that prestigious University and have the discipline to go through that curriculum and pass but that is not the only way to show to a company that you are competent in fact I think even better ways to show that and the first and best of these is just building projects and the reason why building projects is so great and so valuable as a programmer is that it sort of takes care of both of these two things at the same time first of all when you build projects you automatically become a good programmer because think about it if you manage to build a pretty complicated piece of software that automatically means that now you are a good programmer because you were able to go through the process from zero to building this project and it also takes care of proving because you can just show to an employer on your resume this project that you built now essentially proves to them that you know how to code because they will know that there is no possible way that you could have built that project without actually being good at programming which is why what you need to do is simply pick up and choose a complicated project which today has to be more complic licated than it would have been in the past but that is fine you are hardworking right so you should be able to do that but this is where we get into the P where actually getting hired could actually be easier than it was in the past because the thing about these trends like democratization of coding anyone can do it and AI writing code is easy if you just learn how to use these new AI tools you learn how to use these new framework these new IDs the new tools that make writing code easier than ever you can also code up a lot more complicated projects than you could have ever done in the simply by mastering how to use chbt and these tools which is honestly not that difficult like I'm now building a mobile app in Swift and I've never coded in Swift before but I'm getting pretty far without actually learning anything about the foundation of Swift because I can just use AI so if you can just do that and build a couple of pretty impressive projects using AI you can stand out in this sea of applications of people who don't bother to do that because they're either too scared or they just don't have the confidence or they're just too lazy quite frankly companies simp simply want competent employees that has always been the case and that will never change as long as you can keep showing the companies that you are a potential competent employee you will always have a chance but before you can do this there is one more massive skill that you need to learn if you want to get hired if you don't learn the skill you basically can't do it because the skill is like a gatekeeper between you and the highest paying jobs and that skill is a skill of data structures and algorithms so if you can go through a process of learning data algorithms in the way that you then know how to solve the exact problems that the biggest tech companies tested their interviews then you will essentially have access to the highest possible salaries in the tech industry and most people have no idea how to go through this process by the way so what I've done is created a video down below that goes through the one strategy that you need to master if you want to be able to learn dat instruction algorithms and solve this coding interviews so go watch that video down below it's completely free that will show you exactly how to do this even if you don't have a degree even if you haven't solved any coding problems before you can do this so go click that link below I'll see you next time
