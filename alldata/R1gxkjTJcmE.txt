everyone knows that 0 * 
anything equals 0, but why? your intuition is probably telling you 
that multiplication is repeated addition and if I add zero copies of something 
then of course I have zero things if you have a bit of math knowledge 
you might go beyond intuition and say "that's just how multiplication is defined: 
0 is the base case, 0 * anything equals 0, and multiplication of larger numbers is 
defined by saying (y + 1) * x = y * x + x" but we use the symbol "0" for a lot 
more than just the natural numbers 0 the natural number * anything equals 0 0 the real number times anything equals 0 0 in modular arithmetic times anything equals 0 the 0 matrix * anything equals 0 the constant zero function times anything equals 0 and even the zero function 
convolution anything equals zero these are all different types of zeros 
and different types of multiplication they're definitely not simple repeated addition and yet we still end up with 
0 * anything equals 0, why? let's prove it and see what about 
zero actually makes this happen start with the expression 0 * x for now you can assume these are real numbers but we'll see shortly that's not necessary 0 is 0+ 0 because 0 plus anything is that thing then because addition distributes 
this is 0 * x plus 0 * x at this point in the proof we don't know that 0 
* x equals 0 but we know that it's some number and we know that number has a negative so let's add that negative 
to both sides of the equation then group with parens and since a number plus its negative 
is zero we get 0 = 0 + 0 * x and since again 0 plus anything is that thing we finally arrive at 0 * x = 0 in this proof the only facts we really used 
are: that 0 plus anything equals that thing, that addition distributes over multiplication, that every number has a negative 
that cancels it to give zero, and if you want to be real technical we 
did also use associativity to group parens we don't even need commutativity 
of addition or multiplication which is good because matrix 
multiplication is not commutative if you're applying for grad 
school you might describe this as "the identity for an associative 
invertible operation is absorbing   for any other operation that 
distributes over the first" that's why it works for matrices, 
functions, convolutions, and many more because all these types of 
objects satisfy common axioms which in particular include the properties we need and no this does not prove 
that 0 * Infinity equals 0 the proof only works if 0 * Infinity is 
defined so that we can do algebra on it but 0 * Infinity isn't defined so no proof although if you're a teacher it's a fun exercise   to ask your students to explain why 
the proof breaks down for Infinity anyway you're probably wondering 
"well what about those assumptions?" is there a similar trick to show that 
0 plus anything equals that thing? it feels like a very similar kind of problem usually this is just shown manually 
because the behavior of zero under   addition is closely aligned to 
the definition of addition itself a lot of the time you give the label 
zero to an element of your number system precisely because it has the property 
that it does nothing under your addition so maybe the real question is "how do 
we normally define addition at all?" great question, maybe a topic for another video thanks for watching, as always thank you to my   viewers who support the channel through
