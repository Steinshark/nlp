you think it's a meat but until snap oh saved his life until Snapple came in and turn my life upside down see how it's empty because it's so just good and it also helped put out a fire mokey to bury you should tell people that you snap Oh put out fires kind of put that one that holy snap oh can do wonders like that we want to lost this whole forest if I were them for Snapple if you just pay me what quit normally pays me I'll get you at every video last time I was coming home and I noticed my front door was wide open my back door just was kicked down and just about everything expensive was missing as you know there was a TV here but that disappeared with my stupid roommate left they threw everything stole the PlayStation 4 but they left the Xbox 360 I'm a little confused why the robber didn't steal my anime posters and those precious things enlarges no you probably just didn't see it I mean come on like but Jimmy I tweeted about it and Dolan darker replied to my tweet like and Dolan dark can you please not reply to my tweet and get more likes than I get it's kind of embarrassing I feel like no he didn't steal anything out of my kitchen this is how the robber got him he kicked down this door we got it repaired last night yeah so put it up on the screen so yeah I mean you can see the wood and stuff for when he kicked it down this road why did you steal the oculus rift headset but not the sensors like he started you can't even play it if you're gonna rob the property right so in here he spit my bed did he take your seat he's like I'm gonna do this just to say you to this guy I don't even need these he destroyed your closet I actually had tens of thousands of dollars worth of clothes I went to New York and shopped with some of my YouTube friends that blew like 10 grand on clothes like you know Oh Lou Vuitton bag of Louboutin shoes Gucci all that stupid and he stole it also but at least he didn't steal the most important thing easy million right there yeah that's right I'll just sell that and file my Gucci stuff back I wouldn't know what this guy was thinking when he walked in my room and saw just a wall of Asian stickers he probably thought he was robbing a serial killer he probably just walked in my room was like I just like took the TV and ran as I hit the other house oh by the way if you want to help me out visit mr. beast dot shop that is my shop I'm currently selling Asian stickers you should go buy some Asian stickers to help make up for all this I don't need the money at all but I'm gonna use this for sympathy money it's crazy how he didn't steal each of these or $600 apiece there's a TV down here the cops said that he didn't steal my computer because stuff like this is apparently hard to flip so he didn't steal it cuz I'd be hard for him to sell I don't understand we can grab all this and no one noticed I live in the middle of a neighborhood and somehow this guy pulled a u-haul into my backyard and drove off and kicked down my back door and no one noticed your neighbors don't care about you at oh I know I'm going to move out so this place but how are you gonna bring agent sticker with you agent sticker could suck up you'll protect my house or anything you have forsaken Beast you're banished we keep on telling him page and sticker his name's Eric I'm sorry well he's agents do pisses me off don't you just love when you get robbed and you're about to move out so you just don't give a good boy Chris only you can prevent wildfires
