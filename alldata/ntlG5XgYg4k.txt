can of spray paint I'd recommend you don't do this at home we're probably gonna die this approve it is spray paint does work uh we need to wait long to make a lot not doing anything I think it's

we're in a microwave is a can of x-ray should I open it or leave it closed open it open it all right it is open you're doing this I you'd do anything at all so after microwaving acts for five minutes
