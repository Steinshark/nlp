ladies and gentlemen did you know that according to my YouTube analytics 75 of you are between the ages of 18 and 35 No of course you didn't know that because if you had access to my YouTube dashboard it would be weird that means that most of you got into chess or got back into Chess at that age maybe you played it when you were very young but did you know there are kids out there who are three years old and they are really good at chess three I learned how to move the pieces when I was nearly six and in today's video I'm gonna be telling you the story of Mikhail osipov Uh Russian three-year-old chess Prodigy who first came to fame like in an explosion because he was on a Russian TV show where they Spotlight these types of talents and in today's video I'm going to show you clips from the TV show I'm gonna show you the game that he played against world champion Anatoly karpov and at the end we will also look at this little three-year-old dude solving ridiculously hard chess puzzles and then you can show this to your kids and go you see how much time you spend on the iPad you could be Michael and by the way there's a second part to all of this uh which is uh the fact that he came back to the show a little while later when he was four years old so I was going to show you the clip but as it happens even though it's in Russian it's fully copyrighted so instead of showing you the clip I'm just gonna hope that I can click through the clip without actually playing it and setting off copyrights this is a show called Lucifer this is Mikhail osipov he is a tiny tiny human he is three years old and on this show they clearly invite guests who are extremely talented at their field of work and he is so small he can barely get down a flight of stairs the the show host offers to give him a hand coming down the steps by the way if you guys want to watch this video it's great it's got English subtitles uh in case you can't understand and um they sit down and they start having a chat and he he's he's tiniest feet to two sets of his legs could not touch the floor and they talk and and he asks them you know do you know how the night moves which is ironic as Andrea botes asked that to Magnus Carlson at the World Chess Championship last time um and then you know they they talk a little bit and he says he's three years old and he likes to play chess and uh he asks him a few questions and then they bring out a chess set uh he's uh that's not his mom but his mom is in the audience and they sit down and they're gonna play a game with this kind of analog style clock uh but here are the show host admits that he doesn't know how to play chess and they have a surprise guest and this is like a very famous meme uh it's called chess final boss and basically uh the show host invites the 12th world champion Anatoly garpuff you know Sportsman of Russia winning some medal you know the Medal of Honor like you know some some countries they have like this Sports medal um and and they bring out and it's only karpov and then this kid's like what the  he either was not told or he forgot and he's looking around this is like an extremely hilarious Meme and you know Anatoly karpov does a little walk out in the tunnel this is a I can't play it because they'll copyright it hopefully they don't copyright the still images uh and then you know here uh Mishra says we studied your your chess textbook against uh Victor korchnoy uh and and he can barely speak I mean he can barely say any words it's it's adorable I mean it's it's completely hilarious it's so cute and karpov like asked him a few questions and um Mishra takes the white pieces and uh they sit down and they play uh 10 minutes for Mishra and two minutes for karpuff so ten to two not very fair but you know one of them is three and the other one's a World's former world champion and uh you you become a world champion for life it's kind of like being president you know they call you president uh X well uh you know world champion and a totally karpov uh and uh now I'm gonna show you the game and then I'm gonna show you a little bit of the epilogue all right it was it was incredible I mean here's like a still image of them just actively playing you know it's just unbelievable stuff anyway I would have shown you the clip but they copyrighted it so instead I will show you this uh enjoy the game and I will show you the exceptional puzzle solving skills a little bit later uh this video is a few years old obviously uh it was filmed in like uh 20 I don't remember I don't know I don't know my perception of time completely got warped after covet I don't know how long ago it was or or what year but um he's not the only one and so what I want to do on this channel is I want to Spotlight uh individual talents like this so all super started the game with the Queen's Pawn like okay Knight F6 from karpuff C4 E6 this slow man is just straight up playing real openings like he's playing the main line Queen's Pawn he's not even playing a London he's not even playing like a neutered chess opening like the London just kidding London is great but he is playing principled chess openings now Anatoly starts with Knight F6 E6 rather than putting a pawn in the center it's actually considered very mildly inaccurate to play this move order of the Queen's Gambit declined uh if Knight C3 happens the reason black played like this is to fight back against the move E4 with the move Bishop before pinning the knight uh to the king if you know your chest openings you know this is called the nym so Indian if you don't know your chess openings now you know this is called the nimso Indian defense and it's one of the most classical openings in chess it was something that karpov played his entire career in the mid 20th century and late 20th century and here there are a multitude of different lines there's kind of like the ignore line which is E3 and finish your development like this or Knight F3 uh there's other lines though one of the lines now I I don't necessarily thinkov knows that he is playing Mainline Theory I think he just saw a bishop and decided to attack it but it just like you know it so happens in chess sometimes you play a random move in the opening and it turns out to be a line This is called the same-ish variation and basically white just says I don't like your Bishop there take my knight and black says no problem I'm gonna take your knight now why would black give away a bishop so early while black is blocking White's natural development and damaging uh the structure so it's going to be a little hard to get this bishop out obviously on that side and you're most most likely going to have to play E3 so this bishop will get stuck if you play Bishop F4 black will try to very quickly put some pressure on those double pawns so it's uh it's good and bad all right both sides have some problems in the position and karpov plays a C5 which is uh one of the main lines now white here has an approach to very solidly build up the center or this is actually a line that I like to play very much so F3 is kind of like the main line samish and the idea is to play E4 just very very quickly um and in a perfect situation uh White gets something that looks kind of like this and this is really nice white can then play Bishop Knight castle and white enjoys a massive advantage of space but as you can see according to the eval bar it's still equal because such as chess um now C5 proved to be a little bit too enticing uh for the young man uh and he took the pawn now taking on C5 believe it or not I mean as cruel as chess is is already a borderline losing mistake not at his level and not at your level necessarily but at Anatoly carbox level this is a fatal error it's crazy that taking a free pawn and being up one Pawn on move six at the highest level of the game is fatal why is this fatal you shouldn't have tripled pawns you especially should not have tripled isolated pawns no D neighbors no B neighbors everybody needs some D and so tripled pawns uh completely completely weak for the remainder of the game black will play Knight A6 Knight C5 black will play Queen A5 Valkyrie 94. black is gonna get one of the pawns back and then white is still left with all the difficulties of having the bad structure is three years old he just saw Free Pawn and he took it can you blame him all right so Knight A6 and in this position uh Misha realized well I'm not gonna be I probably shouldn't hang on to my Pawn even though moves like Queen D4 moves like Bishop E3 are all enticing um it could do more harm than good because as you can see the eval drops even more if you try to defend your Pawn right so instead he plays Bishop G5 now Bishop G5 is it's not the most accurate move but he's developing a bishop all right he's not trying to be greedy he's developing a bishop he's pinning the Knight to the queen uh and life is good now here karpov just kind of playing the principled move which is taking the pawn back and now karpov will be castling and he will probably put his Knight on e4 like I said black has regained the pawn and he still has the benefits of the position what does black not have certain dark Square assets right this bishop could try to get in all people develops his Knight I mean he's just developing his pieces like normal okay he's slightly worse is playing Anatoly carp of arguably one of the greatest positional chess players to ever live B6 carp of delaying castling in order to finish his development and play in typical nimso style in the nimso Indian all the way back to this move C5 black wants to apply pressure to these pawns by virtue of Knight A5 as well as Bishop A6 and in this game we're not going to get Knight A5 we have Knight on C5 but karpov wants to apply some C file pressure to those pawns and you kind of see white got the bishop pair early but because white captured on C5 white has certain drawbacks right so we have B6 um and now we have G3 I mean he's he's going here now carp of a machine all right you understand carpal was developing his Queen side was gonna go B6 Bishop Basics but the second that little osip of played G3 trying to develop his Bishop to G2 Anatoly did not play Bishop A6 trying to win this pawn and it totally played H6 why did he play H6 now because if he had played H6 in this position the bishop would have gone here and G5 the bishop can just escape and there's nothing the second the youngster played this to finish up his development now Anatoly went here because now you ain't got this yeah you ain't pinning nothing cause I'm trapping your Bishop one subtle pawn move and World Champion plays H6 now mishra's young he sees his Bishop as hanging he probably saw Bishop H4 G5 so he said I'm gonna take but now remember White's entire advantage of this position the only thing that white could cling on to was the bishop pair he no longer has it however the position is still materially equal for a kid this age this is ridiculous uh now he just plays Knight D4 why did he play Knight D4 not Bishop G2 he saw this was hanging and that's really tough to protect you could play Rook C1 but then your Rook is kind of passive Queen D2 there's a fork he he probably thought Knight D4 I'm gonna go here and I'm gonna attack his Rook unfortunately Mr karpov was a little bit faster here but Misha played the best move F3 not afraid of weakening his position he's gonna go here here and Castle carp of castles Aussie puff plays Bishop to G2 finishing up his development and now that Anatoly has sort of finished the opening stage it's time to start taking over the position utilizing the advantages that he got from the opening stage and he plays Bishop A6 right so this Pawn is going to be very tough to defend if you play Knight B5 you stop the attack on this but I got news for you unfortunately you exacerbate matters and now it's gonna get real bad and uh Hiroshima plays one about he plays F4 plays ponza F4 counter-attacking The Rook he's three damn it dude you know how few of you would see F4 like I don't know 200 000 of you this dude is three years old it was a matter of weeks ago he might have not been able to use the potty he might still not I don't know when kids are get potty trained I don't have one I have a dog he's he's barely potty trained all right he's body training I don't know why I'm throwing him under the bus he's great he's wonderful he was awful the first six months but now he's wonderful uh I'm sorry Benji you're great can you get me a pet food sponsorship yo pet food companies hit me up I'm just don't spend money on those Super Bowl ads like 30 million I'll do it for half Rook C8 castles Bishop C4 now here there is a funny moment folks remember how I told you that it was 10 minutes versus two well here it's about a minute each Mishra was playing a little slowly because he's three so karpov's here says well you know you and I are even on time so and even in the position do you want to draw and ownership of looks at him and goes not understanding that he's probably gonna lose on time and well unfortunately he strikes at the World Champ the World Champ doesn't doesn't allow any activity here doesn't allow any of this stuff he closes down the position and in just a couple of moves he secures a clamp on the center everything is defended pressure on the position and here uh unfortunately Mishra always people have lost on time now it was uh it was in a it was uh it was sad it was definitely a little bit sad to see um he was very teary-eyed he cried a little bit he was very overwhelmed by the moment and by the way it's a separate discussion bringing a three-year-old in a television program but he was very overwhelmed but he was any any ran to his mom his mom comforted him but then I mean Anatoly was so so compliment he was saying I've never played somebody this young his understanding is that of a mature Sportsman it's beautiful incredible I highly encourage you to watch it especially because it's subtitled then they brought him back they gave him a medal and uh and and and it was it was amazing it was uh well I'll show you it's after they played uh Mishra was a bit upset he was a bit overwhelmed by the moment uh with you know the crowd and everything and and he got a bit teary-eyed and he ran to his mom it was a very very sweet moment and reminding us that he is literally three years old which is just so mind-blowing um and then what they did is they awarded him a medal and they invited him to solve puzzles on the monitor so it's tiny Misha and a totally karpov in the show host and Mishra is just solving tactics on a big screen he's solving tactics I mean look at this this is this is crazy he's solving checkmates in three which I will show you I will show I'm gonna show them to you separately um and at some point the host you know he solves another one and you know Mishra I have no words and at some point the host asked Anatoly is this impressive for a three-year-old and anatoly's like unbelievably impressive like so impressive um he is solving some absurd chess studies like like impossible positions that can arise when they are you know made like somebody creates the position because the solution is so beautiful and sophisticated and this three-year-old boy uh is solving them I I mean it's it's just unbelievable stuff so I just wanted to show you this I would have showed you the clip but I can or else they'll you know not allow me to monetize the video or even upload it so enjoy the footage uh of of him solving these positions this little man solved this position it's made in three I mean you you try to solve it you're the person you want pause the video try to solve this Checkmate in three this three-year-old solved Checkmate in three he said Knight H6 because Queen g7's night night takes here that's not mate you hunt the king out and now the king is cut off geometrically Knight F5 prevents but how okay he's good but can he solve a study this is not a real practical position it's white to move do something super creative and win the game Knight G5 okay Rook G5 this dude said this answer before it even appeared on the screen look at F6 Rook D6 mate a king and Rook mate in Reverse in this in the middle of I mean come on this is ridiculous and so the producer has carpool he's like is it actually like quite difficult to solve this when you're three it's quite difficult to solve this if you're 45 and the last one I mean was absurd so it's white to move Checkmate in three you actually try to solve this white to move Checkmate in three first of all this position is not legal because there's no way it can be white to move unless uh the King was just on that square or something because that that that's you know and and white gave a check and black didn't take the Knight um this is so sick this one and he solved it Bishop F6 and now the pawn has to take the bishop the pawn didn't have a legal move now there's there's King f8 it's stalemate but the pawn moves get at it I mean this is just now now I because this was a few years ago so Michelle was like I don't know nine or ten now hopefully he's still playing what sometimes happens is when a kid and when anybody has so much High behind them they very very they don't they don't live up to it sometimes you know LeBron James is probably the greatest example of somebody who has avoided trouble and lived up to the hype right like in in terms of it's what a lot of people say I can't I can't speak about football I don't know about you know football prospects um but uh it's just incredible so I really hope uh he um you know turns into quite a good player and these kind of like early media runs don't totally uh take away from his confidence or uh you know make him Starstruck and I've known kids like I used to teach at schools if anybody's still here watching I used to teach uh before I was a YouTuber I taught at schools I ran my own chess program and um the the the the scariest thing for me was rushing a young kid into big things like I I taught a few four and five-year-olds that were exceptional students they were great they love chess Natural Curiosity it was amazing watching their brain connect neurons and fire them and learn new things but the second they went to competition that was it they couldn't handle it the stress the pressure all this stuff so uh I wish him all the best and and I I want to cover you know some more young prodigies on this channel because learning chess and being this good at it at three is uh is is is uh unbelievable feat of the human mind I really I I mean exceptional stuff um I'm glad I could share mikhailos with all of you and um I wish you all have a great rest of your day or evening get out of here
