ladies and gentlemen everybody loves a little bit of drama and if you remember what happened at the end of 2022 in the world of Chess we had quite a big drama and it involved a possibility of cheating in the game of chess now all the videos that I make on my YouTube channel when I talk about cheaters do very well there's something fun and exciting about deviance and my ability to catch cheaters or potentially expose them and if I don't expose them then at least I use them for Content like today in today's video I'm going to show you a story of a chess cheater like no other a person that cheated over the course of two years now he didn't cheat consecutively for two years that would be a very very bad spot to be and if you're the chess.com fair play team that's not what happened this is the story of how an individual cheated took a break from chess came back tried to play on his own failed in spectacular fashion and then violently cheated for a span of two weeks until he was banned also if you notice I'm obviously not home but I do have a big plant behind me um and I would like to name this plant so if you have any ideas in the comments do let me know um we can name this plant something and I guess you know the the top uh the top comment wins so We Begin our journey of this cheater back in June 2021 this is one of the first games that this person played on chess.com they were already cheating okay they were so nervous about playing chess on their own that they were using a bot okay now what this person uh would do is they would play like a very very designated opening okay and back in their early career This Is How They played they would play this kind of weird offbeat French Sicilian type of thing uh and then they would do this and you know obviously they're playing a 400 like they're playing somebody who doesn't even realize that the Knight and the queen both support the pawn on D4 okay you remember those days some of you might not even be 400 right now some of you might not even enjoy chess much but you like my videos um now our cheater would not cheat on All Phases of the game uh you know as you can see here black is not making all the best moves but at some point and you know when you're playing a 400 there's probably going to be a moment already that you're just completely in control um but black would start to cheat at some point for sure now obviously white is just losing all their pieces so it's not a particularly impressive by the way Bishop takes knight uh is just an absolutely clean piece it also has happens to be the top engine move now taking the pawn as the top engine move now developing the Knight is the top engine move and of course trading Queens when you're winning is the top engine move now most normal people here block the check why because if you move your king you lose the right to Castle but King E7 is actually believe it or not the top computer move because the computer wants to play Knight F6 and it also doesn't you don't need to protect your king so much when your opponent has no pieces uh White loses another Pawn now you might say what is so interesting about this content white is just simply losing all of their material right well black just completely butchers this 400 I mean takes all of their pieces now proceeds to take every single one of their pawns keep in mind this is one of the first games that this person played on just.com now Knight takes G4 is mate Knight to F3 is mate this is stalemate the cheater misread what needed to take on G4 and instead of mating in one move drew the game of course there is another potential story here which is the fact that the cheater didn't want to get caught that's what cheaters do sometimes they think oh if I draw this game then I won't get caught I mean sure I played every top computer move and probably outperformed everybody else at the 800 level category but I'm not gonna get caught so Rook takes G4 right I mean you move away from mate you are up 23 points of material and you play essentially the worst move on the board in fact that is the worst move on the board because it ends the game and you don't win there's no way to lose here I suppose I mean I guess you could go here and then allow them to make a queen and then get mated but right now this is literally the worst move including G5 G5 and Rook takes G4 are the two ways to get stalemate here so yeah Rook takes G4 now this person cheated for quite a bit of time in the early part of their career and then they left this is where the story gets really interesting this person cheated for like a week or two in 2021 and they got up to about 1400 and then they left and keep in mind when you make a new account on any chess website your rating goes up and down like 200 points so they got up to 1400 and then they left and this is where the story gets really fun because this is where they came back okay uh this is where they came back um actually no this is not where they came back I actually forgot I even included this game nope this is not where they came back this is one of the games that they played right before they left apologies you know new location got a plant behind me I I don't know why that's an excuse to forget my script but that's okay this was a very funny game our cheater played uh because the cheater actually ran into another cheater now in this game uh you you can see that you know cheater one who's the protagonist is playing cheater too look at cheater two's game plan cheater too would sacrifice material early in the game to sacrifice their cap score like to be like oh look I don't always play the best moves and then we cheat the rest of the game so um for example in this position the move A3 is actually like one of the top computer moves which is very funny uh and then H3 and then rookie one and then uh you look at black black just voluntarily gives up the night both cheaters think that they're making uh you know they're messing up their cap scores and cheater one was used to making bad moves for a long time and then cheating and winning but in this game uh look at this watch this your knight is pinned and if you move it you're gonna lose your queen you see that so you trade queens and you go Knight and and then before you move your knight you damage your opponent's Pawn structure and then you move your knight out to the edge of the board now white plays the top computer move which is Pawn to B3 I don't even know Rook B8 now now another top computer move Rook infiltrating Bishop to G7 now another top computer move A4 Rook C8 H4 just improving the position and then cheater number two actually trapped The Rook with B5 and cheater one was like what took the bishop and just resigned fascinating story of a cheater who Who's Cheating then proceeds to play a cheater and is like uh what is going on why am I not winning despite sacrificing why it resigns leaves for two years and comes back and tries to play on his own at the rating of 1400 now the three games that you are about to see are a person who cheated then came back to chess like I was when I was uncovering this information I was a guest at how much content there was here um this person came back to chess after two years tried to play on their own and God slaughtered completely like lost every game that they played and as always I don't make fun of people for losing I make fun of people who are cheating and then try to play on their own it's very different um it's like you know if an athlete gets caught taking it like I'm a UFC fan right so UFC fans mixed martial arts fans that they they they they know people pre-usato post usada like Johnny Hendricks the guy who in many people's as B George Saint Pierre before George Saint Pierre retired like there was a period of time there was no performance enhancing drug tests and then after there were and there was people whose careers well it's you know we're affected drastically this is kind of the same thing here all right um now here are three games of our cheater trying to play on their own after stepping away for a while F4 E5 F takes E5 F6 so far so good right Bishop b4k black is playing some weird stuff some 1500 Blitz game okay why just hangs upon it's just a clean Pawn hang okay Bishop C4 check King h8 I love how the feedback is on for this all right no white just loses the pawn all right and plays D4 uh black plays Queen F6 and um is apparently now much worse white plays Knight E5 which is a good move um I actually think white cheated for these two moves if I'm being honest 95 uh and C3 which were the computer stop choice now we have Knight F7 now Knight F7 looks really appealing it looks appealing to most intermediate players because it actually forces Rook takes because if black plays King Jade there is Knight D6 which is a discovered attack um from the bishop so Rook F7 Rook F7 and now we have Bishop takes H2 which is obviously a mistake uh you should probably go hunting with the Queen White plays King F1 and now our cheater trying to play uh on their own uh plays the move Rook f8 check which they thought was made and that just loses a rook then they proceed to hang their Bishop and then they not only fail to develop the Knight into a night that's also a fork of king and queen are cheater playing games on their own lost a rook a bishop a knight and a queen a rook a bishop a knight and a queen 20 points of material were lost in the span of five turns that is unbelievably impressive I mean that's like that's really impressive a 1470 doing that wow it gets better I also noticed that our cheater had a game plan that they like to implement in every single game which was putting the bishop on the diagonal and then playing Queen B6 this was so fascinating to see because we got to see into the into the brain of a cheater when they only play on their own and this is what this person did every single game they would bring their Queen out attacking this and have their Bishop here as well and it was surprisingly effective the problem is even though they had this really genius opening that could like defeat you know 14 and 1500s after they landed this trick they lost every game so white was you know white accidentally blunders the pawn on B2 okay that's a problem and then played Bishop back the problem is this was literally where the cheater's ability of Chess completely stopped on their own like they could only play Queen B6 Queen B2 and and they were doing this in basically every game I mean they was playing Queen B6 and then and then taking the pawn now he would develop white would try to trap the queen and then you know for some reason the queen would go all the way back and white maintains an advantage despite being a pawn down because of so much activity E5 is a great move now the cheater just moved the Knight multiple times right so White's move Queen C1 very clearly making a battery pointing at that Knight that you have just moved two times and obviously you know you're in serious trouble here because this is your only safe move and then white can play G4 it's a problem or you could just lose the Knight I had such a blast I mean you just moved your knight twice right the guy goes here andrego's Queen C1 very clearly lining up a cannon this way and you just have no idea you just don't even you know F6 you just busted up here uh and then you push Pawns in front of your king and white just obliterates the king's position this was so satisfying you know Andre trading the Rooks you shouldn't trade Rooks if you're gonna give up an open file like this and and this is just game over I mean there's a multitude of ways to win um black can probably defend by trading the Queens but then I don't even know I mean rookie seven looks really good I have no idea what the best move is here for black the best move might be like hanging your bishop and then try honestly I don't know I don't know why it's only minus 2.7 because I think if Queen d8 there's rookie seven okay Queen d8 apparently is The Right Move rookie seven oh there might be a miracle defense here Rook F7 wow look at that and then there's a pin wow that's crazy I don't even know what the best move is here for white this is nuts rookie five to defend the that's crazy that's all right see this is how a human thinks in chess um this is how like a you know and yeah our our protagonist here just got uh pulled apart I mean just broken broken one more fun game for you uh that they played completely on their own in their comeback to chess remember I told you about this game plan that they liked what even is this the guy just lost so instant replay last game the guy got hit with this right the cheater was playing Black got hit with this and did it took this and and try to use it themselves oh my God but there's nothing there there's no night so what are they doing now they're trying to play you know Bishop out opponent moves The Rook all right at least they got a decent opening position um now what happens when you leave a beginner on their own in the middle game they drowned Knight E2 Knight G5 everything is well protected stop taking these random night Journeys out that don't even do anything of course just H6 is coming right just H6 now the Knight has to come back uh now black takes a free Pawn and white plays Bishop H6 now to his credit he actually did learn from the last game which is really interesting it's interesting to see human brain development right Queen C1 Bishop D2 which six and the exact same thing here Queen C1 Bishop D2 and he's like oh wow that last time it worked so you know it's gonna work for me here a black plays D5 take take yeah so again this person we just watched them learn from the previous individual uh what they obviously did not learn was um control of squares and here we have Knight Chief so it's not the first mistake in chess that kills you right Knight G5 losing a knight losing and after this our cheater made a chess.com account in 2021 cheated for a little while didn't get caught didn't get caught logged off didn't log in for two years logged back in tried to play five or six games on their own lost every game I mean honestly if you combine their average accuracy in those games it was probably like six games combined was probably less than a hundred and then they started cheating again and uh this person cheated basically from that last moment so late April 2023 until like April 30th April 29th I don't remember when the last game was played uh this person cheated they got tired of being trash and they cheated and they got up pretty high I mean this person was so mad about losing so many games that um he just cheated and just kept and let's see what what a cheater looks like at 2400 I mean the things this person did to like of course cheating is bad you know I'm more so laughing at how ridiculous this story is where a person tries chess cheats every game and is like walking away from it for two years then comes back and just like well I really love chess let me play on my own just loses like it's no tomorrow um you know uh what this person would do to not get caught is to play moves like this which just lose pawns now of course that's a horrible move C3 is a terrible move but it's not a terrible move if you're cheating right if you're like 2400 it's only Pawn odds computers can beat Magnus Carlson Hikaru Nakamura nowadays up down two Pawns in the beginning of the game which is a massive Advantage All Humans would beat all other humans up two pawns but not you guys I'm talking about top players like Frank and Magnus and Hikaru so Bishop C4 E6 obviously you know black is just developing uh White is cheating every move Knight E5 Knight C6 um and uh again this cheater would uh would would do things in a way that they would try to throw off the average accuracy so you know what they would do things like this of course Knight F7 is just a completely horrendous move it's just down the night and black is just going to play Knight F6 rook f8 and king Jade but this cheater I mean there's a scumbag right like they're they're they're deliberately sacrificing material and they're gonna cheat now white plays F4 uh F4 uh is trying to attack the king before it can consolidate black needs three moves Knight f8 Rook here King G8 so now you want to play F5 uh Knight F6 is still a completely reasonable move uh White is still cheating so white plays F5 now there is no threat here there is absolutely no threat what you should do is you should play Rook f8 and after F takes E6 you should actually not take and instead just run to the corner but that's very hard to do as a human because you're allowing your opponent to take pawns and check you but believe it or not this Pawn is just gonna die anyway and this whole prioritization of just evicting the king and push pushing him to the corner is good because black is up material white is not going to do any damage with just the bishop but black is a human black is not cheating so black gets scared and plays the move Knight A5 attacking the bishop that unfortunately for the time being allows white to still have opportunities here and if you try to evict the king with uh you know Evacuate the king it's not going to work black plays Queen D5 which again threatens mate not a bad move Queen E2 defense and now black plays Rook ae8 which looks like a good move it's not though it's not because of the top computer response which is Pawn to B4 for some reason uh the move B4 sends the Knight back to C6 and temporarily gets in the way of the configuration of these pieces and white can then kind of use the queen in the center as the target it's the top computer move and now the top computer move for black is to play this this queen D4 forking the king in The Rook King H1 and now if you take this white plays Bishop B2 and has monstrous pressure here so the best move for black is not even to take the Rook I mean computers are just absolutely ridiculous black plays Knight C6 and now white plays Knight A3 top computer move again you want to play Knight C4 fortnite B5 looking for this or looking for this or looking for this and hitting the queen black plays Bishop D6 which is also a very natural move it's not a good move though because of Knight B5 and now the advantage is almost back to equal and black plays Knight d8 98 of course very natural looking for this but unfortunately the move Knight d8 allows white immediately back into the game with the move C4 Queen has to go back to C6 and now black is Uber congested what did the move C4 have to do with the what do C4 and G5 in this position have to do with each other this is how engines think in chess this is why stockfish is such a scumbag because the move C4 deflects the queen from defending the G5 square and now white has yet another piece coming to the party and now it is far too late to save the king black still tries to save the king but now white is winning white is winning because of the move what D5 wait but I don't understand what about Bishop takes Pawn takes and then Queen H5 well as it turns out this looks good but after King E7 Queen H7 which looks very natural this is still an issue and your queen is hit and the king is safe so before you do any of that you have to play D5 which basically makes black choke on a fishbone and now this is not a thing so now you go to H5 you don't take the Knight you wait to see where the king is gonna go the safest route is to run through the open Center and try to hide in the corner but black is not a computer so black goes here now white butchers the Knight and now white is able to move the queen already you notice had white tried to just play Queen H5 they wouldn't have been able to take the knight in this position because this would have been mate I mean this is really sickening stuff Queen H5 now you take now that mate is blocked so black plays Rook F6 but now Queen H7 Rook F6 and every move is checked and now if I ask you what is the most natural move here for white like if I ask you what you know how do you continue the attack many of you would say queen h8 some of you would say Bishop G6 you know trying to cut off the Escape looking for something like this you know that's a very human thing to calculate Rook F1 by the way right to play Rook F6 Knight D4 what hitting the queen its only safe square is this but then you play Bishop G6 because the queen has been marooned over here and all of this is coming Knight D4 is so nasty black tries to create tactics by pinning the Knight to the king but black doesn't know they're playing a cheater now any human being here goes here right well first check now takes Queen C5 rookie one King D7 and it looks like the king is just a moment away from retirement it's like uh heist movies you know Oceans 11 Italian job you're so close to getting the money and just escaping on your yacht Bishop F5 and unfortunately your king now has to come to the to the center first you can block white plays the top engine move which is Queen F6 defending the Knight because this is not actually a thing Bishop E6 Bishop G4 Bishop F3 and black resigned because this is mate in the center of the board absolutely brutalized and uh a few games after this one our cheater was uh banned what a story 2021 you get into chess just like most people honestly just like most people if you click on their profile it says their chess.com account was created 2020 2021 22-23 then they cheated then they felt guilty so they stopped then they came back after two years and tried to play on their own and they were terrible they were probably like you know 600 level I'm only saying 600 is terrible because they were cheating then they cheated and they gained a thousand points in like 10 days and they got banned what a fascinating story I've never seen something like this I mean usually people cheat and they get banned in a week this one was really a whole anime Arc so fascinating and um yeah let me know if you have a name for the plant now get out of here
