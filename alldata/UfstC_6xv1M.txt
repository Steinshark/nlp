this episode is brought to you by brilliant 270 years ago the warship HMS Victory tragically sank in a violent storm in the English Channel this historic vessel was in route back to England after aiding a British Convoy besieged by a French blockade in Portugal isolated from its Fleet the victory circum to weather conditions on October 5th 1744 leading to the loss of all 1100 crew members this event is remembered as one of the gravest maritime disasters in British Naval History within the channel among the loss was a notable sea captain and inventor John cers he was on the victory to demonstrate his Innovative creation the whirling horizontal speculum a navigational instrument that would indicate a fixed horizontal plane despite the movement of the ship C's instrument used a mirror and an attached spinning top to produce this Artificial Horizon marking the first use of a gyroscope as a tool of navigation in 1817 German astronomer Johan gotlib Frederick Von bonenberger invented the first device that resembled a modern gyroscope bonen Burger's apparatus referred to as the machine of bonenberger consisted of a heavy symmetrically built ball which could rotate freely around its center of gravity suspended with within three Centric Rings called a gimbal with each able to rotate on a different axis this design allowed for the demonstration and study of the principles of rotational motion Walter R Johnson was among several individuals who independently invented the gyroscope in the 1830s Johnson called his invention the rotoscope and unlike bonenberger machine the spinning element was a disc ultimately French physicist Leon FCO would be credited with inventing the gyroscope in 1852 both coining and popularizing the name itself his version of the gyroscope was designed to demonstrate the Earth's rotation in a groundbreaking manner allowing for 10 minutes of motion experimentation at a time a gyroscope operates on the principle of the conservation of angular momentum which states that the angular momentum of a rotating object will remain constant unless it is influenced by an external torque when a gyroscope wheel spins it maintains its orientation due to the angular momentum generated by the spinning motion the magnitude of this angular momentum depends on two things how fast the object is spinning or its angular velocity and how much mass is distributed away from the axis of rotation or its moment of inertia the faster the gyroscope spins the greater G its angular momentum and the more it resists changes to its orientation gyroscopic procession is a phenomena that occurs when force is applied to a spinning object instead of moving in the direction of the applied force the gyroscope moves perpendicular to it this is because the applied force creates a torque and due to the gyroscope rotation the effect of this torque is manifested in a direction perpendicular to the force the torque tries to change the direction of the gyroscope angular momentum but due to the conservation of angular momentum the gyroscope instead processes around the axis of the applied torque at the dawn of the 20th century German art historian and inventor Herman and schitz K became intrigued with the challenges of polar navigation where traditional magnetic compasses are less effective this led him to develop the gyro Compass a tool that could maintain a consistent reference Direction regardless of external magnetic influences a gyro Compass contains a rapidly spinning rotor mounted within gimbles allowing it to rotate freely this rotor maintains its orientation due to gyroscopic inertia however unlike a standard gyroscope a gyro Compass is designed to align with the Earth's axis this alignment is achieved through the interaction of the Earth's rotation and gravity with the spinning rotor creating a torque that causes the rotor to process gradually shifting its orientation the gimbals play a crucial role by allowing the rotor the necessary freedom to align itself with the Earth's axis this process although not instantaneous results in the gyro compass pointing towards true north or geographical North independent of magnetic influences the gyro compasses ability to resist interference from magnetic anomalies or nearby metallic objects makes it highly reliable for navigation especially in regions where magnetic compasses are less effective in 1905 AMS K along with Frederick trich founded the first firm anuts and Company dedicated to manufacturing gyroscopic navigation instruments the first commercial ship with an anuts gyro Compass was the passenger ship imperata of hapag line in 1913 marking the beginning of the commercialization of gyroscopic instruments for practical use in navigation in 1910 American inventor Elmer Ambrose sper would form the sper gyroscope company to manufacture gyroscopic navigation equipment as the company grew throughout World War I as the sper corporation the newly emerging field of combat Aviation created a demand for a broad range of Gyro instruments one of their most popular instruments was the gyro horizon or attitude indicator much like the machine of Bon Burger this instrument uses a gyroscopic effect to display deviation from a set Horizon however it does this in two axes showing both the pitch and role of an aircraft via a gimal gyroscope that is kept spinning using the suction of an engine powered vacuum pump Beyond Simple instrumentation sper also pioneered the use of Gyro stabilization in a gyro stabilized system a gyroscopes resistance to ch changes in its orientation is used as a feedback mechanism to counteract the overall motion experienced by the system this is typically achieved by using Motors or other mechanisms to apply torque based on the gyroscopes feedback gyro stabilization would prove to be a valuable tool for creating both stabilized gun sights and bomb sights Beyond this when an attitude indicator is paired with a manually aligned variant of a gyro Compass known as a directional gyro or heading indicator the entire aircraft can be put into gyro stabilization using feedback to drive the flight controls effectively creating an autopilot one of spar's early groundbreaking Innovations World War II was a pivotal time period for the advancement of gyroscopic technology as it marked the transition from simple instrumentation to far more sophisticated navigational mechanisms known as inertial navigation systems or ins inertial navigation systems use gyroscopes and other motion sensors such as accelerometers with a computer to continuously calculate the position orientation and the velocity of a moving object without the need for external references originally developed for Rockets simple gyroscopic systems could be found on early experimental Rockets with the concept quickly becoming an integral part of rocketry Germany's V2 rocket guidance systems contained one of the first deployments of inertial guidance technology with its guidance navigation and control system that was driven by two electrically powered gyroscopes and a lateral accelerometer the V2 system employed a simple analog computer to adjust the azimeth for the rocket in Flight driving four graphite Rudders within the Rocket's exhaust stream for flight control an inertial navigation system typically consists of a computer and a sensor system called an inertial measurement unit that consists of accelerometers gyroscopes and other motion sensing devices initially the ins receives its position velocity and orientation from an external Source such as a human operator subsequently it independently calculates and updates its position and velocity by processing data from these motion sensors one key advantage of an ins is its self-sufficiency requiring no external references once it's initialized this independence from external references makes it it robust against jamming and deceptive signals the ins can effectively detect changes in various aspects of motion Geographic position velocity and orientation it accomplishes this by measuring linear acceleration and angular velocity apply to the system gyroscopes specifically measure the angular displacement and by utilizing the initial orientation as a starting point and integrating angular displacement the system can continually determine its current orientation accelerometers on the other hand measure linear acceleration relative to the moving vehicle's sensor or body frame they sense changes like forward acceleration deceleration upward and downward forces within the vehicle however they are unaware if their absolute orientation relative to the Earth since they move with the system to determine linear acceleration in the inertial reference frame the system integrates the current angular velocity and linear acceleration measured relative to the moving system system this integration using the initial velocity as a starting point yields the inertial velocities further integration employing the initial position as a starting point yields the inertial position the computers used in early in systems were either mechanical or electrical Analog Devices that lack the ability to process signals because of these limitations calibrated levels of damping were used on some gyroscopes to perform mechanical rate processing by limiting the free motion of a gyroscope through a spring in one axis a rate gyroscope is created this concept can be taken even further with more sophisticated forms of damping known as rate integrating gyroscopes the gimbal procession could be regulated by a heavy viscous damping fluid or similar damping mechanism to determine rates of angular change integrated over time while gyroscopic ins technology revolutionized guidance and navigation post world War one of the fundamental challenges they face is the issue of drift drift in an ins refers to the gradual accumulation of Errors over time leading to a deviation from the true path or position the root cause of drift in an ins lies in its Reliance on accelerometers and gyroscopes to continuously calculate position velocity and orientation by integrating incoming data over time while these instruments can be made to be highly accurate they are not perfect small such as bias in the gyroscopes OR noise in the accelerometers can accumulate since the ins calculates its current position based on previous data any error however small gets integrated into the subsequent calculations this integration of Errors leads to drift which grow over time making the data increasingly unreliable compounding the issu is the fact that inss operate in a closed loop meaning they do not reference external sources for correction once initialized this is olation from external reference points is both a strength and a weakness it allows in's to function in environments where external correction is unavailable or unreliable but it also means that there is no external data to correct any integral errors that may accumulate the first Ines for example would drift as badly as one nautical mile per hour of operation shortly after World War II the United States would field its own ballistic missile the sm65 atlas ICBM based on Germany's V 2 program the atlas's inertial sensing platform used only two gyroscopes for pitch and roll sensing but made use of three pendulum based axis accelerometers to determine its position the atlas became the first ins to Pioneer the use of Sensor Fusion via external radio guidance these early variants of the Rockets relied on Grom based guidance updates from one of the first transistor-based computers designed by Isaac L Arbok the atlas Rocket series operated on the concept of Delta guidance which is based on the adherence to a planned reference trajectory by the 1960s the Thor ICBM system and the derived Delta rocket program would result in one of the most versatile rocket systems ever produced the Thor system employed a new dogma of guidance known as Q guidance this concept consists of a relatively short boost phase during which the missiles propulsion system system operates followed by a ballistic phase during which the missile coasts to its Target under the influence of gravity the objective of Q guance is to hit a specific Target at a specific time with no Reliance on a reference trajectory this flexibility was a direct result of advancements in computing power and miniaturization the guidance and control equipment is housed in the Ford section of the second stage and provided guidance sequencing and stabilization signals for both first and second stages the system contains three Gyros four accelerometers and conditioning electronics and a guidance computer that processes inertial sensor data to obtain attitude reference and navigational information while providing continuous guidance correction signals based on a comparison of the instantaneous orbit to the desired Mission orbit the computer also issued pre-programmed sequence commands and provided control system stabilization Logic for both powered and Coast phases of flight first and second stage electronic packages receive the guidance commands from the guidance computer in the second stage and in turn Drive the servos for the engine Gimbal and control gas jet operations computer-based ins technology soon became critical to the Aerospace industry especially as the Space Race ensued in aviation the first fully operational ins for aircraft was developed in the 1950s for the B-52 known as the n6 inertial navigation system the system system represented a significant technological breakthrough allowing for much more accurate and autonomous long-range navigation than was previously possible in civil aviation the Delco Carousel was becoming a popular partially automated commercial ins this system used a gyroscope and accelerometer based inertial measurement unit as its reference a digital computer to compute the navigation solution and a control panel mounted within the aircraft's cockpit it was used for long overw and over the North Pole aircraft navigation flight crew would enterr upt to nine individual way points by their latitude and longitude and then the starting location in latitude and longitude the system was so effective that it would be adopted for use in military aircraft and remain in use well into the 1980s as various evolved variants in 1913 French physicist George Sak had set out to detect the Earth's motion through the hypothetical ether believe that the time to be the medium through which light waves propagated in his experiment sagnak split a beam of light and sent the two beams in opposite directions around a rotating platform when an object rotates the light beam moving against the direction of rotation travels at a longer path compared to the beam moving with the rotation this difference in path length causes a phase shift in the light resulting in an interference pattern that can be measured known as the sagc effect this characteristic would prove to be particularly useful for detecting rotational Motion in 1963 the first experimental ring laser gyroscope was demonstrated in the US by WM mck and DTM Davis Jr at the sper corporation this groundbreaking development led to the widespread adoption of ring laser gyroscopes in various High Precision navigation systems ring laser gyroscopes include a ring laser setup where counterpropagating beams circulate a key feature of this design is the absence of moving parts except for the ditter motor assembly and Laser lock mechanism that are used to mitigate lock in a condition that occurs at low rates of rotation where the counter travel distances become very similar this lack of mechanical components eliminates friction a common source of drift in conventional gyroscopes thereby enhancing the stability and accuracy of the Ring laser gyroscopes ring laser gyroscopes can operate in excess of 60,000 hours between failure with less than a 100th of a degree per hour of drift by the 1980s ring laser gyroscopes along with their fiber optic based counterpart began to appear in the in's of a broad range of Civilian and military aircraft their size and reliability also made them well suited for missile use additionally with the Advent of GPS in the late 1970s and the increased power of embedded Computing in's would slowly evolve into hybrid systems that fuse positional data from GPS and other non-inertial sensors such as magnetometers and terrestrial radio navigation systems to produce incredible levels of navigational robustness and accuracy during the 1980s another theoretical method for measuring rotational rate was being developed into a practical mechanism called a vibrating structure gyroscope or coriolis vibratory gyroscope this type of gyroscope uses the principle of vibration to measure rotational rate the key principle behind its operation is the corol effect which affects a vibrating object when its support structure rotates as this rotation occurs the vibrating object tends to keep vibrating in its original plane this results in a cholis force exerted on the support and by measuring this Force the rate of rotation can be determined in the mid 1980s GC Marone experimented with various metal alloys with attached p Electric element elements to produce a functional sensor by the 1990s various other configurations of the concept would be explored piso Ceramics in particular proved to be incredibly durable being able to handle up to 300 GS and 500,000 hours of continuous operation other explored variations used tuning fork structures spheres wine glass configurations and various other geometries ultimately the technology would intersect with the emergence of micro electromechanic mecal systems or Ms and by the beginning of the 21st century a new spectrum of microscopic vibrating structure gyroscopes would be paired with accelerometers on completely embedded inertial measurement units that were not only small in size and durable but incredibly inexpensive to mass produce and interface with software while not as accurate as their macroscopic counterparts these advantages allow for capabilities once reserved for massive airspace and defense programs to be had by millions of consumer products such as smartphones personal navigation devices game systems and Vehicle Safety Systems like many of the Legacy mechanical systems that now interfac with Computing the future of inertial sensing lies in the power of the software that it drives this Evolution will undoubtedly expand their applications Beyond current Realms potentially enabling more immersive virtual and augmented reality experiences more responsive autonomous vehicles and Advanced personal navigation systems Additionally the fusion of gyroscope data with artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms promises to open New Frontiers in Predictive Analytics and motion-based user interfaces as these Technologies continue to evolve gyroscopes will play a crucial role in shaping our interaction with the digital and physical worlds making motion sensing more intuitive and integrated into our daily [Music] lives I find it f fascinating to think that the simple observation of
