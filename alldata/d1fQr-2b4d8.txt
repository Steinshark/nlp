NES for nearly two decades it's had a lively competitive scene with world record holders polishing their skills to see who can beat it the quickest it requires precision and finger speed that would even make Mike Tyson proud because the speedrun Mega Man 2 at the top level you must break it after all walls are just suggestions and ceilings are figments of our imagination this is the story of how speedrunners broke Mega Man 2. this is the history of Mega Man 2 world records [Music] and now a word from this video sponsor nordvpn for years potato sock 500 was the fastest internet surfer in the

really goes a long way so where do we begin the early history of Mega Man 2's world record is an enigma to uncover in the mid-2000s people completed runs both with and without video proof on different versions of the game and with different rule sets at certain points in time what would be considered the true world record was ambiguous and to this day putting together an accurate timeline is quite difficult yet through all that there's one run that's pretty unanimously considered to be the first world record the year was 2004. the runner was Richard euretta and his final time was 30 minutes and 39 seconds [Music] in Mega Man 2 you're presented with eight stages you can complete in any order euretta decided to start with Airman where he precisely jumped on the lips of blocks to avoid slowing down you only have about a 4 pixel window to do so and risk dying from a missed jump he then had to slowly ride on the clouds to make it further in the stage and on the boss fight used the Mega Buster to take down Airman euretta then played quick man stage where he repeatedly rode item 2 to quickly skip through long corridors quick man himself has a random pattern but euretta once again took him down nicely with the Mega Buster next up was Flashman where air man's weapon was used on larger enemies and item 2 helped him skip over the last room on Metal Man stage you're at a froze time with flashman's weapon so he could run through without the spikes falling on him he also jumped forward on the conveyors moving against him so he wouldn't be pushed back item 2 was utilized once again although he had to carefully maneuver around spawning enemies and on the boss fight he used quick boomerangs which is metal man's weakness with four Robot Masters down and metal man's overpowered weapon acquired yoretta went into Bubble Man stage the shrimp and fish are quite weak to metal blades sieretto was able to jump up and shoot them down to quickly clear a path ahead it was similar to how a casual player would get through the stage but the key difference is that euretta never stopped running he precisely maneuvered and barely let go of right on the d-pad on Hitman stage euretta once again jumped from column to column without slowing down he used item 2 to cross the lava Gap later on and used bubble lead on heat man heat has random delays between his shots but since it only takes three bubbles to kill him they hardly mattered at all here more on those delays later next up was crash man whose stage is filled with ladders that you normally have to slowly climb however if you place down an item 3 while you're climbing up the ladder you can then jump off of it and save a bit of time euretta also used item one to his Advantage by letting him bypass ladder sections altogether and avoid having to ride on the slow conveyors and finally there was Woodman euretta's most notable strategy here was using flashman's time stopper to prevent the dogs from spawning after a Charged heat shot to Woodman he had completed the eight robot stages but now the game's difficulty takes a big step up it's time for the Wily stages Wiley 1 is similar to crash man stage and that there are several ladders you have to climb up euretta used both item 1 and item 3 to help then mashed quick Boomerang at the dragon boss for a quick kill in Wiley 2 euretta Shot the leaf shield to protect against projectiles in the long corridor they randomly drop health and ammo which are bad luck in a speed run since it slows you down to pick them up Wiley 3 is the easiest Wiley stage with the only tough part being at the end when you have to jump up and mash boomerangs as fast as possible the final three Wily stages are perhaps the most important in the entire run Wiley 4 features an enormous sequence of ladders at the start with several careful item 3 placements uretta was able to quickly Traverse his way to the top while barely slowing down then you have four Spike screens to get through normally you're supposed to ride around on the conveyor and Dodge enemies but Richard euretta had other ideas in the first room he took damage and used iframes to barely make it across the spikes in the third room he used item 2 to quickly get iframes again and in the fourth room he used item 1 to just barely reach the conveyor early and make it to the exit in Wiley 5 you re-fight they robots euretta used each boss's weakness against them meaning most fights were completed in a matter of seconds for the stage boss he used metal blades to tear through the first phase and then a crash bomb he had saved from the Wily 4 boss and finally there was Wiley six for the stage itself you just walk to the end without slowing down but the alien boss is another story you have to hit him with 14 Bubbles and if you make contact with him known as hugging the alien he tanks your health euretta's strategy was to get hit by a projectile then use the iframes to briefly Mash bubble lead as fast as he could he avoided hugging the alien and closed out the run at 30 39. and with that Mega Man 2 had its first world record it was a solid run with few big mistakes but at the end of the day was it that far removed from a pristine casual playthrough euretta was obviously much more skilled than a casual player and tricks like damage boosting and Wiley 4 did help but running through the stages and obliterating the bosses with their weaknesses isn't necessarily that difficult to do for the next couple of years there would be little activity but then the timeline starts to get tricky see Mega Man 2 lets you play on either normal or difficult mode difficult mode means enemies take more shots to kill particularly the bosses euretta's run was on normal mode since it's faster than difficult mode but in late 2006 a Vibrant speedrunning Community for the game would form in Japan there the game is known as Rock Man 2 and it has one distinct difference it defaults to difficult mode with no option to change it you'd think that would mean it's slower than Mega Man 2 but text cutscenes take significantly less time in Rockman 2. so much less time that it ends up being a wash with the time loss from playing on difficult mode so Rock Man 2 and Mega Man 2 runs are comparable in time but rock mantu is considered the more challenging speed run and after a series of improvements through 2007 despite playing on a more difficult version of the game a runner from Japan named Lambda would beat urata's run by over a minute Lambda saved time in just about every stage despite bosses taking much longer a lot of it came from just being a bit cleaner everywhere fewer small mistakes and Tighter execution this added up big time over the course of the run in Wiley 4 you can see how more item 3 placements and faster movement saved Lambda significant time in all this run felt like less of an expert's casual playthrough and more like a polished speedrun boosted by the fact that he played on a more difficult version of the game in 2008 a runner named Hoshi would set another string of Rockman 2 records ultimately taking it down to 29-15 he saved about three seconds in bubble from fewer knockbacks and about four in Clash from better item 3 placement on the ladders together Lambda and Hoshi had taken Rockman 2 to the next level this was just 2008 yet their speed runs were optimized to levels most games wouldn't see for years but there's one thing to note about these runs they were played according to peer cast rules Japan's leading speedrun Hub at the time and one rule from purecast stated that Auto fire was allowed meaning you could hold down the button and fire your weapon up to 30 times per second this made some sections of the game easier like killing enemies without slowing down and it made some sections impossibly fast like the alien fight in Wiley 6 which normally takes 28 shots to kill in Rockman 2. [Music] but still their runs certainly shouldn't be dismissed it's estimated that Auto fire only saved them about 20 seconds the rest of the difference came from better strategies and execution so while it's a little tricky to say how Lambda and hoshi's runs fit into the timeline it's safe to say that they were by far the best executed Rockman 2 speedruns of their era now about two weeks after hoshi's 2915 the Run would once again be lowered by 10 seconds a 2905 on the North American version of the game by a runner named Seth glass but there's something a bit different about this run see prior speed runs of the game were submitted to Twin Galaxies and purecast websites which prohibited the use of glitches Seth glass was submitting to speed demos archive so he was free to use whatever glitches he wanted and boy did he ever use them [Music] these are Mega Man 2's zips item 1 Rises toward the top of the screen and allows you to ride it until your head hits the ceiling however it doesn't actually check for a collision instead item 1 detects if it's below a ceiling and then disappears once it's a certain distance away so if you place item 1 or item 3 away from a ceiling but stand on the edge so Mega Man is below one you'll get pushed into it since item 1 never despawns how does the game respond to Mega Man being in the ceiling well if he faces to the left it ejects him to the right ceiling glitches had been known in Mega Man 2 for many years but a tool-assisted speedrunner named final fighter was the first to really explore them for their time saving potential I've heard several Zips all across the run back in 2004. many of which Seth glass would use in this run four years later glass's new route through the game which he borrowed from the tasks was to start with Flashman so he could obtain item 3. then in Hitman stage he'd performed the first zip by placing an item 3 while touching the bottom of the ladder then re-rabbing the ladder you can jump back on it while facing right and enter the ceiling you need to face left to trigger the zip but moving left causes Mega Man to fall out of the wall so glass did what's called an a trigger by jumping while stuck in the ceiling Mega Man quickly lands and cannot move for the next four frames so if you press left in that four Frame Window Mega Man Zips all the way to the right out of the wall Seth glass had a 15th of a second to time it but was able to skip an enormous chunk of Hitman stage he then played through Airman and crash Man without any Zips although he used a beautiful new strategy in Airman stage called Fast air by precisely placing and jumping off of item 1 then jumping on the very edge of clouds to avoid taking damage glass was able to make it across the Gap without having to ride on the slow-moving clouds he then entered quick man stage where he'd placed two item ones down so he could jump up and enter the ceiling to initiate the zip glass this time did a b trigger by placing an item 1 in the wall Mega Man then has 16 frames where he can't move press left during that window and the zip will begin B triggers have a window that's four times as big as H figures but they can't be performed if you're out of item 1 ammo or if there's already three of them on the screen triggering these Zips isn't free but it can lead to minutes of time save if utilized across the run so that's exactly what Seth glass did glass would go on to perform Zips in Metal Man [Music] Bubble Man [Music] Wiley 2 [Music] Wiley six in the cases of quick man and Wiley six he had to make sure he didn't soft lock the game if your zip leads you into a screen transition you have to stop the zip by pressing left or right just as you get there if you're too late you soft lock the game but if you're too early you have to wiggle by re-pressing left your zip begins again and you can continue to adjust or wiggle until you perfectly land on the screen transition Runners on speed demos archive were thrilled to see a run of the game with zips but truth be told there were Still Moments where it could have been better optimized over the next year multiple faster times would be set but the timeline of the official world record is problematic in early 2009 Hoshi would get a couple runs in the high 28 range but without autofire they wouldn't have been faster than glass's run in April a runner named Mega Destructor 9 set a time of 28.42 but the video has since been removed from YouTube but as the months passed the timeline became a bit clearer and over the next couple of years the record would see rapid Improvement as players implemented more and more zips in December 2009 a runner named nou1 got a 2838 on Rockman 2 without using Auto fire it stood for a few months until Seth glass came back and set a series of Records on normal mode ultimately getting a run that clocked in at 27.51 this was a legendary record it was posted to speed demos archive and quickly became one of the most popular runs on the site his 2751 would go on to inspire a new generation of Mega Man 2 Runners and stands to this day as a benchmark for high-level Runners to compare against but it would only remain as the world's fastest run for about 10 months when a runner named foremo beat it on Rockman 2 with a 2748 furemo Used Auto fire but only at 10 shots per second this is well within the rate at which humans can Button Mash so it's not thought to have given them any significant advantage in fact he actually played at a disadvantage furemo played on Wii Virtual Console which has a slower frame rate than original hardware and loses about 9 seconds over the course of the Run but forema would only be on top for about a month and a half because in March of 2011 all of the new Zips and all of the new tricks that have been slowly implemented in the preceding runs came together in a legendary performance by nou1 this was by far the best run of Rockman 2 ever completed nou1 would achieve a time of 2721 a world record that would stand for years the first three stages of this run flash heat and air were all similar to previous records however the new Antics began in clashman stage where nou1 performed a zip that looked like this [Music] it looks complicated but behind the scenes it's a bit more straightforward see you don't actually need to climb up this ladder to get to the next screen you do a horizontal zip the game will take him there just the same when you move into the ceiling you activate a horizontal zip that moves Mega Man forward several screens when you move to the next screen the game briefly shows the screen Mega Man is actually on before snapping back to the normal View this comparison by Bisquick shows what's actually happening you then simply walk to the right to get through the next few screens while the game shows you is walking through the ground finally you fall down where there's a ladder and since it's done when the screen isn't horizontally aligned it has the same effect as Dying by Falling in a pit the game then respawns you much further in the stage and by releasing an atomic fire shot when you die the game runs the routine faster the clashman zip was first seen in nou once 2838 and was executed to perfection in this 27-21 also first seen in the 2838 was a second zip on quick man stage after falling at the start you can place three item ones down do an a trigger in the ceiling and zip past a long corridor fortunately the lights turn off since the light switch responsible for turning them back on never spawns that means you have to do the quick laser section of the stage in the dark you have to memorize exactly where the ledges are and exactly when to jump off it's doable with a lot of practice but it's one of the most impressive looking parts of the run it also means you have to do both the later zip and the boss fight in the dark as well once again nou1 executed this stage beautifully next up was Woodman a stage that was overhauled starting in Seth glass's 2751 and continuing in foremost 2748 first there was the dog Scrolls by going into the ceiling when the dog spawn you can do a b trigger and zip to the end of the screen this needs to be repeated on each of the next screens and you must be careful to not overzip but it allows you to skip past the dogs quickly just a screen later you perform a trick called Good Wood it looks like a complete mess but in reality it works just like the clashman zip in that the screen gets offset with where Mega Man actually is visuals from Duck fist show what's really going on you perform multiple Zips and navigate through the stage while being careful not to fall off some of these moves take a large amount of precision like grabbing an invisible ladder in midair there's too much going on to concisely explain here but eventually you're able to zip and fall to your death late enough in the stage that you respawn at the boss corridor with so many moving Parts it's an incredibly difficult trick but it lets you skip over much of the stage and once again nou1 nailed it and finally there were the vertical wraps by getting partially stuck in the wall at the top of the screen the next screen triggers but Mega Man stays at the top this can save you from having to play through a slow screen it's used at times in the Woodman zip but is also used in both Wiley 1 and the first half of Wile E4 all these tricks combined with nearly impeccable execution elsewhere meant nou1 was able to finish at 27.21 this was a monster world record Japan had had a vibrant Rock Man 2 Community for years and after thousands of attempts from numerous different Runners this run seemed to be the final product Runners from the Western speedrunning Community looked on with awe nobody there was close to beating it either for the next two years this 2721 was unparalleled at the top around the time that nou1's record was set a new Runner began playing the game he do attempts off and on for the next couple years improving his skills but still remaining far from the world record but in August 2013 after returning from a break he decided to attempt what no Runner had done in the past two and a half years make a push for the world record his name was Cipher [Music] Cipher's idea was to implement several high-risk High reward strategies from the tasks that could save him time this was a risky move although these tricks had the potential to be faster Cipher knew he would lose a lot of runs going for them the biggest one was the task Clash sip by going for the zip on the first screen instead of the second you could save up to 10 seconds a huge amount of time in an optimized run but it is tough you have to very precisely place two item ones in the right spot and zip multiple times in the span of a few seconds there's practically no margin for error but even with a low level of consistency Cipher felt the time save was worth it other New Tricks included a short zip in Metal Man and a zip with item 2 in bubble man combined these could save up to about 4 seconds and then Wiley 4 he went for a trick called the extended ceiling zip where you wait out Mega Man's stuck state from item 3 and press down on the next screen to clip High into the ceiling and zip further than normal a trick found by a runner named ello these were really difficult strategies but Cipher was committed to going for them his consistency wasn't amazing and he struggled to get a clean run by October 2013 he was still nearly a minute off the world record shave off more than 55 seconds to beat nou1 he would take a miracle to get all that in one run right [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] Cipher had just cut a full minute off his personal best it had taken months of grinding but he was the new Rockman 2 record holder this run wasn't without its mistakes however some of his zip setups were slow particularly in Metal Man and Woodman and then while he won he had missed a vertical wrap altogether but the time saved from task Clash made up for all that and it was still a record by multiple seconds now nou 1's record had stood for more than two and a half years how long would Cipher's record be on top well how about six weeks meet shoka in December 2013 a runner named shoka would take nine seconds off the world record it was once again performed on Rockman 2. by this point virtually all top level competition was on Rockman 2 rather than Mega Man 2. a trend that has continued to this day shoka went for the incredibly difficult task Clash but skipped some of the smaller time saves like the bottom Metal Man zip it was overall a very consistent balanced speed run with fewer obvious mistakes than Cipher's run shoka once again used 10 Hertz auto fire as permitted in Japanese communities at the time but just as before it's not thought to have given him any significant advantage the record was starting to get close to a big barrier a sub-27 to get there someone would have to save nine seconds over shoka's run was that possible well there were a few seconds to save from a cleaner Clash zip and a few in metal from the extra zip and a cleaner stage but the largest time safe potential came from the boss fights specifically we're gonna look at heat man the biggest potential RNG swing in the game after every shot you hit him with heat man can do one of three random delays 31 frames 62 frames or 93 frames they're commonly rounded to 30 60 and 90 frames each delay has a roughly equal chance to occur in speed runs players buffer jumps so they don't have to react to the delay one jump means a 30 delay two means a 60 and 3 means a 90. in Rockman 2 heatman takes 14 megabuster shots to kill meaning there are 13 rolls of the dice for what delay you'll get an average pattern has the same number of 30 delays as 90 delays something like 430s 560s and 490s showcas 2708 got great RNG 730s 360s and 390s that leads to an obvious question what's the best fight anyone's ever gotten that honor goes to a guy named the big boy who got this unbelievable fight [Music] I want to play some manga in one can I just [Music] are you kidding me [Music] 12 out of 13 delays were 30s odds of one in fifty thousand in theory you could get 13 out of 13 but it may never happen the odds of it are nearly one in 1.6 million the potential for better RNG combined with some mistakes shoka made meant Cipher had a few seconds to save here added together with time saves elsewhere and that left enough room for a sub-27 but the road for Cipher would be long his personal best was still 27-17 meaning he was 18 seconds away surely he wouldn't be able to get there all in one go again right [Music] on July 9th 2014 Cipher entered the last stage on a remarkable run putting him on Pace for a 2701 but there was a little bit of time to save on Wiley six if he got a fast setup into the ceiling and didn't have to wiggle to enter the door he would save time over his split the question was would it be enough for sub 27 foreign the Run would be re-timed to 2701 leaving Cypher just two seconds from his goal as you can tell Cipher had mixed reactions to this on the one hand he had gotten a world record by seven seconds but on the other hand he had just missed his goal time where had it gone wrong well he got a mediocre pattern on heat man so he didn't gain any time there he also lost a bit of time in Wiley 2 from some unlucky drops but his biggest mistake was in Wiley 4 where he missed a vertical wrap to lose 5 Seconds that mistake alone cost him a 26-56 one tiny imprecision was the difference between another 27 minute run and the world's first 26. so Cipher knew he had to keep going it had taken just three weeks of attempts to get to 2701. he was prepared to continue a run with just one fewer mistake with just a bit better luck could be enough to get the 26. any attempt Could Be the One but it wasn't happening weeks passed with no new record then months passed Cipher's personal best remained at 2701. and then in February 2015 Cipher announced his retirement from speedrunning he felt that it was taking up too much time and wanted to focus his attention elsewhere Cipher's Legacy would remain however over the years Cipher entertained thousands with his runs and together with shoka took the record down right to the limits of the 27 minute mark but he didn't quite achieve his goal the cipher era of Rockman 2 had come to an end without his sub-27 thank you a trick found by a runner named Ella [Music] foreign [Music] this was quite a situation ello found himself in on Pace for a 26-55 with one stage to go who was this guy well Ella had started running the game in 2013 and started a steady March of improvements stayed well behind shoka and Cipher's records but throughout 2014 The Gap got smaller finally by November he was within Striking Distance his skill level was on par with ciphers and he started doing sub-27 attempts this had been a great run through Wiley 3 cleaning up the mistakes that Cipher had made but the amazing part started in Wily 4. ello hit everything including his own extended ceiling zip leading to a gold split and thanks to beautiful luck and execution and wiley5 he got his second gold split in a row the fastest he had ever completed two of the most important stages in the Run it led to him being six seconds ahead of the record into Wiley six but there's one other aspect of velo's game we haven't talked about yet Ello is an incredible button Masher he can Mash at 16 presses per second 10 Hertz autofire would be a huge disadvantage to him this comes into play in a few spots like the dragon and Wiley one but nowhere is it more important than on the alien and Wiley six the alien starts on the right then moves in a figure eight pattern around the screen your goal is to hit him 28 times by the time he leaves the right side for the second time if not you lose a few seconds even for top Runners this can sometimes be difficult since you can only hit him when he's low enough and you have to worry about hugging the alien but Ella was better at this than anyone and after entering the door in Wily 6 he was just an alien fight away from the world's first sub-27 [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] for the first time ever Rock Man 2 had been beaten in under 27 minutes as celebration poured in across the community ello seemed to be in a State of Shock he'd snap out of it quickly though and spent the next several months working on other speedrunning projects all the while his 2657 remained the only run under the 27-minute barrier he had no Challengers for his record and it remained on top well into 2015. but was it a perfect run of course not there were a couple Zips where he stopped short and had to do a lot of wiggling and on quick man he got a bad pattern and had to waste several seconds waiting for an extra Clash bomb to explode part of the problem with the Run was task Clash the hardest trick in the game Ella successfully hit it in the 2657 but a majority of his runs that made it there failed the trick and had to be reset that meant the overall quality of his runs suffered there was a choke point four stages into the run so a lot of potentially good speed runs never saw the light of day but task Clash saved 10 seconds you couldn't just skip it if you wanted record enter the big boy back in 2012 the big boy found an alternate version of task Clash where he went to the right at the start to place item one instead of climbing up right away it wasn't paid much attention to at the time but it was actually a significantly easier method of doing the trick since it reduced the Precision of your inputs overall it did lose a second and a half but that would easily be worth not having the reset as often trick would go on to be nicknamed biggie in honor of its creator so when ello came back to runs in August 2015 he did Biggie instead of task Clash for a few months it didn't necessarily seem to be paying off no records and many runs dying to the last Wily stages but on October 22nd ello had a fantastic Heat fight 8 30s 460s and just 190. that put him three and a half seconds ahead of the record so even when he lost time going for biggie he was still easily on Pace with a clean quick man stage and faster vertical wraps on Wiley one he was nearly six seconds ahead but that lead would erode over a strong final four splits he lost a bit in Wiley 3 from bad luck and had slow quick and Clash fights in Wiley 5. but a slight lead still remained and after some incredible mashing on the alien it was enough to take the record one second lower one year to lower the record one second that's how tough Rockman 2 runs were becoming it took months for even the best player in the world to get a record Improvement who could say how long the next record would take the very next day Ella was a couple seconds ahead going into the refights Wiley five's boss re-fights is one of the most random parts of the game the biggest points of variance are quick air and heat quick man has random high jumps and Boomerang throws that can lose you time Airman has different projectile patterns he can shoot out ello's goal was to get a two-cycle fight with the leaf Shield but it often wasn't possible even with good execution and heat man works just like he did the first time but only has four spots for delays instead of 13. the execution on some of these fights is tough too especially quick air and wood so ello just had to do his best and hope his RNG and execution was good enough to keep the Run alive oh I got screwed on TV's over you have no idea how much time that costs and then I flew the classified so I haven't even seen the major RNG and it's already over oh sorry I I need 90. [Music] if you didn't know it sorry about it so long it wasn't over the reef fights weren't great but Ella was only a second behind overall and with a really good zip and fast alien kill he could save up to two seconds on the last split [Music] a 55. that's actually ello's second record in two days he was now six seconds ahead of Cipher and had held the world record for a full year but ello still wasn't satisfied he had aspirations for something bigger he continued grinding the game off and on for a few months but was unable to lower the record any further the 2655 was a pretty clean run maybe he had reached his ultimate goal but if he was to beat it again the key would be Wiley five it was possible to save five and a half seconds on that split alone so if he could at least keep it close through Wiley 4 then he could save a few seconds in Wiley 5 to put him back in front he just needed to be within Striking Distance going into the refights one day in late January 2016 ello started up a run and would gain a second on quick man from a better boss fight and from there he chipped away frames until entering the Wily stages one and a half seconds ahead of the record ahead this deep into the Run was impressive he just had to keep it close by the time he got to Wiley five but he didn't keep it close he pulled further ahead with a nearly Flawless Wiley one and two he was three seconds ahead going into Wiley 3. there was potential to lose some time on the Wiley 3 boss he takes 14 shots to kill and you have to jump up and match the fire button in a brief window while in the air ideally you want to do this in three jumps or about five shots per jump but sometimes it can take four jumps or even longer but as we know ello's really good at mashing [Music] this was the first two jump kill in Rockman 2 history seven hits per jump it had been theorized and done in practice but never before had someone hit it in a speed run ello just needed to be close going into Wily 5. instead he was 3.8 seconds ahead and sure enough he picked up some more time on the refights gaining three seconds to put him 6.8 seconds ahead going into the last stage this was the chance of a lifetime for ello he could just close it out [Music] [Music] this wasn't just the record it was the demolition of a video game after becoming the first runner to get a sub-27 ello had now become the first and only to get a sub 2650 as well this wasn't just the best run of Rockman 2 ever performed it was one of the strongest world records of any game ello himself said that he was done the community was in awe of what he had accomplished and nobody would even try beating it as 2016 continued the game entered a period of dormancy at the top people were still running the game but ello's skill level was far above the rest only two Runners had a sub-27 and nobody was within 10 seconds of the record 2017 came around still nothing by this point ELO's record had stood for over a year there was just nobody good enough to Beat It well nobody who wasn't retired at least Cipher retired in early 2015 with his 2701 since then new strategies had been developed that would allow that time to be significantly faster if anyone in the community could beat ello it would be Cipher but unfortunately he wasn't interested in coming back Cypher had moved on and the community would just have to accept that someone else would need to be the one to beat the 2648. and then came agdq 2018. that year a runner named Sinister one was organizing a relay race of Mega Man 1-3 for awesome Games Done Quick and he really wanted Cypher to participate he hadn't ran the game in three years but he was a hugely important part to the game's history Cipher resisted he was done with speedrunning and had no interest in returning but Sinister kept pushing and finally after having time to consider it Cipher agreed to play the game for the Relay race [Music] he had three years of rust to shake off it was hard to say how well his skills would translate after such a long time off he learned the new strategies and built up his consistency with all the game's tricks after weeks of diligent practice race day finally arrived and to give you an idea of how the event went going into Mega Man 2 Cipher's team was in the last place of the four teams 28 minutes later his team went into Mega Man 3 with the lead Cipher had single-handedly taken his team from last to first place and largely thanks to his performance they would go on to win the race Cipher's skill was still clearly all there he hadn't lost anything in his three years of retirement and when combining his abilities with the developments that had been made who knew what his limits could be so roughly 40 months after his last session of world record attempts Cipher decided he was gonna make one more push for the record the road was gonna be tough Cipher had achieved a 2659 in preparation for the Relay race but he was still 11 seconds behind ello while that was good for second place it seemed like he still had a long way to go but suddenly in late January 2018 Cipher would find himself on world record pace and laid into a run after a fantastic eight robot stages and a big time save on Wiley 5 he was two seconds ahead of ello into Wiley six there are two steps to the last stage first you need to get the zip and enter the boss room Mission perfectly accomplished step two fight the alien and get a right side kill oh my God [Music] I can't believe I threw it away at the alien the alien fight had gone horribly wrong he took damage too early and got turned around multiple times while trying to mash it cost him the record but he still did get a decent PB out of it but that's okay he had already gotten a record-paced run to the last stage world record was right around the corner Cipher continued doing attempts now just five seconds away from the record but strangely despite being right there he found himself unable to take the remaining time off his personal best he was getting runs deep but the combination of Wiley 4 5 and 6 were able to shut it down every time even though Cipher could get on record pace through Wiley 3 closing it out through the last three stages is really tough the attempts continued but Cipher's personal best stayed put the time he had sunk into the game was adding up and he wasn't getting the returns he wanted he had come out of retirement for a record grind but while the grind was certainly real the record was nowhere to be found and all the while Cipher felt like he was neglecting something perhaps it's best to let him explain it around that time I was trying to break into the tech industry as a software engineer you know I needed to find a job so during this time I was looking for jobs and in my spare time I was working on Mega Man 2. I did about a month of serious grinding and then I had decided the Mega Man 2 Brian is simply too distracting like I'm not doing as much work as I would like to be doing on the job search and I feel like I need to put down the Mega Man 2. and I decided I just picked a weekend and I told myself all right I'm gonna do attempts up until this and if it doesn't happen then it just doesn't happen and I need to buckle down in the job search so he had a deadline the first weekend of February it quickly approached and Cipher poured in attempts to try and get the record I think I had a nine hour stream and then an 11 hour stream on Saturday and Sunday if they were like I'd never do attempt sessions that long those were Marathon attempt sessions I was probably I mean the the play quality was probably not that great across both of those sessions just because I was going much harder than I would have gone otherwise for a normal attempt session but yeah that's how it was and by the end of it all no new record Cipher's deadline had come and gone and ellos 2648 was still on top it was time to give up the record grind but he decided to give himself one more chance before throwing in the towel for good on that Monday he decided to participate in one last speed running event one that was organized by Sinister one the same guy who initially got Cipher back into the grind with the agdq relay race this event was called Chase for the record hello and welcome everybody this is Chase for the record Rockman 2 and we have quite a show for you today so Chase for the record is an online competition where you'll take typically the best four players in a game that is highly competitive at a moment in time and get all of them to play at the same time to do attempts at the same time and then you can kind of show like who's actually on a good pace and hopefully see a world record during the the attempts which is generally about a three hour window this event would feature four competitors Cipher and Ella were the first two the former and current world record holders the third was Zoda a promising Runner whose best time was in the low 27s and the fourth was cool kid but you might know him better as the big boy he had changed his username and started running Rockman too seriously and had driven his time all the way down to 26-56 a legitimate world record contender this was going to be Cipher's last chance three hours to get it done but the odds of him actually pulling this off weren't great I think Cypher was hoping for big things but you know realistically you can't expect in a three-hour period in a game of such a high level of difficulty that you would actually get the record the odds are very low they're not in your favor it was my last day to do runs and it would have been a sort of historic moment where it would be the first time anyone ever set a record during an event like this so in the beginning of the event typically you want to kind of introduce the game to the audience so we have them do a no reset run just four-way race nice matching there from cool kid he can finish it off looks like 27-28 wow and then it was on into attempts but Cipher has moved on he is gonna be into heat man in a moment and Zoda right into attempts as well I'm not sure I've ever been as focused on anything in my life and Cypher gonna set up this first zip here nicely done right up against the ceiling that's what you're looking to see from any of those uh item one ZIP setups I've got three hours I'm gonna try my best to make it happen and whatever happens happens and he gets the one blade that's probably the most favorable pattern pretty quickly I got a run deep in the game and I gotta run to Wiley too that was on good face I'm pretty sure it was on record face he didn't go far enough to the right that's that's rough ah man he was like one pixel away and he stopped I was a little disappointed but I was like you know what it's just one run we like immediately into another run I was very accepting of the probable outcome that I wouldn't set the record on that show as cool kid makes his way into what many think is the most dangerous stage in the game Wiley four purple hell cool kid managed to get on a run and he actually got a small PB little offer for this just being on the show okay let's see what kind of Entry gets really [Music] anything else happening in the event I was not listening to the commentary [Music] and then he finishes at all I I think I I'm not sure I even knew that cool kid got a PB someone may have mentioned it in my chat Cipher is uh on in the heat man stage here he's he's the only player that's uh got something going so far but of course still early game [Music] I got past the early game Gauntlet of you know air and Clash I got past the biggie special once you get past the biggie special at the start of clash then you have a real run yeah he's he's in good shape here uh yet again gonna be moving on and then I realized I got another run to the Wiley stages within half an hour after losing that Wily toothpaste like I'm I'm just playing out of my mind he's got to be thinking about what happened last time in Wiley 2 here so hopefully he's able to get this ZIP set up yeah I'm always worried about the over correct okay that one is good that one was definitely good Wiley Ford this has been the uh the Bane lately this is it so the difficulty of wily 4 is that you really have to draw on all the disciplines that you have in Rockman 2 you have horizontal Zips you have vertical Zips you have item three drops you have a door crash that you have to do everything has to come together in this one stage where it's very high pressure and I kept just playing well and not losing it anywhere and wiley4 happens went well or to maintain his Pace but that's a 45 so he is on world record Pace going into re-fights so going in Wiley five we knew Cipher was on a good Pace we didn't know his exact Pace because as the way commentators had things set up we can't really see their splits so we knew he's ahead but not by how much he goes air first which can really go badly if you don't get a good pattern and he got a decent pattern so we were thinking okay there's a chance here important he's getting a really nice fight so far ice these little jumps oh yeah this is good once he got past quick man we were kind of like this is probably gonna be it this could be world record right here right now on Chase for the record I just need to do this ZIP and I need to mash down the alien and then I'll be able to achieve this thing that I would just be a massive massive moment and accomplishment for me oh that's a good that's good he's in there we're in there let's go he just has the match [Music] turn everything off but if he can avoid this first shot he'll be in good shape don't touch the alien all right okay oh my god dude we got this we got it it was a truly euphoric moment I uh it was euphoric that's it World Records on the world record 26-43 unbelievable foreign [Music] I I can't describe it any other way we saw that you know not only is this record but this is record by a significant amount I was just kind of floored you know he had done this knowing that you know this is your last time that you're actually going to be running the game it's now or never I was just overwhelmed with emotion and then I just I just started crying the Run would be re-timed as a 26-42 beating ello by six seconds and Cipher could finally take his well-deserved break but at the end of the day you just can't keep Cypher from Rockman 2. he'd spend the next few weeks on other tasks but Rockman 2 was still calling his name and sure enough by March he was back to doing record attempts but this time he wasn't alone cool kid had driven his PB all the way down to 26.47 good for second place and he was coming for the top spot Cipher and cool kid were in a race for the next world record they'd have new strategies to help a high-level Runner named prizzy had developed a couple first there was the clashman manip by jumping and shooting left at the start of the fight you can guarantee the two shot quick kill to save a bit of time second prizzy rediscovered that you could use item 3 to jump through the floor in Wiley floor to save time this had been done in runs years ago but prizzy found that even though you have to wait for item 3 to disappear before doing the vertical wrap it still will save time there had also been a new strategy discovered in quick man stage that Cipher first did in his 2642. by doing a slight hesitation during the first zip you could keep the lights on didn't save time on its own but it made the rest of the stage easier Cipher and cool kid both had a legitimate shot at this but on March 16th Cipher found himself six and a half ahead into Wiley five a chance to crush the category unfortunately despite getting a great Airman pattern he mis-executed and lost five seconds he'd finished it off as a 26-41 still a small world record but Cipher couldn't help but feel disappointed this run wasn't what it could have been it had the potential for a 26 3x time a time that would have seemingly put the record Out Of Reach a time that he had theorized with ello years prior for the absolute limits of the category but one mistake in Wiley five prevented it all [Music] this is it this is it I just need like I need a decent refinance [Music] all right [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] this was the record Cipher had been looking for it was a solid run through Wiley 4. he lost a little bit of time on the Airman and quick man fights in their respective stages but he knew he had time to save in wildly five and he saved seven seconds it put him well into the 26 3x range and he closed it out with a 26-37 and as it turned out this was good enough for Cipher to end the grind he stopped playing the game and his record remained far ahead of anyone else well at least for a little while because just a few weeks later cool kid was on his way his time was down to 2643 still six seconds from Cipher but he was closing in quickly see cool kid wasn't just any speedrunner he was also the Mega Man 1 record holder a title he had held off and on for more than three years it made sense that he would one day hold the Mega Man 2 record as well but he had a really tough world record to beat in 2637 on May 7th cool kid got on a run that had a below average heat man pattern meaning he'd have some time to make up he'd save a bit from a faster air fight then save the couple in quick from a frame perfect sip by triggering it on the first frame possible Mega Man only gets pushed up one tile instead of two meaning you can quickly zip through the boss Corridor as well just about the only substantial mistake through the eight robots was missing the initial item 1 placement on the Woodman zip going into Wiley six he was about a second behind the record if he could perfectly Crash the door on the zip he might just barely be able to get this oh my God this might pull record right foreign the Run would be re-timed to a 26 37.00 beating the record by 10 frames Cipher's massive world record and only been standing for about four weeks and more than six years after his initial biggie Discovery cool kid had become the record holder and then everything went silent for the first time in months there was no Act of competition for Rockman 2's world record Cipher had moved on cool kid had moved on and nobody else was within Striking Distance and so the record stood and it stood for years through the rest of 2018 all of 2019 and all of 2020 cool kids 2637 stayed put as the world record there were no Rivals no contenders nobody could beat the pair of 2637s in the top spots but then in early 2021 guess who came back to run the game look what you just saw look what you just waddled your lane although he hadn't done serious record attempts in several years ello started up The Grind again in January 2021 it had been so long could he still compete with the time set by Cipher and cool kid well he quickly got a two-second personal best then he took another two seconds off and then another now down to 26.42 ello was quickly honing in on the world record it all came to a head on March 26 2021. ello got on a run that game time early but bled a bit going into the Wily stages touring Wiley 3 he was about two seconds ahead this was a serious chance at a sub 2640 but given that his best possible time from here was a 2634 it actually still had an outside shot at the world record this was a small but possible chance to jump straight to the record [Music] whoa my power messes went out oh my God my TV's all I'm not even kidding what the my power just massively flickered and my TV looks completely I'm not even kidding all the colors just went am I still whoa it did it again did it again did it again and my power went out are you serious ello would continue doing runs for a few weeks but he'd never take his personal best under 26.42. to this day that's where his best time stands he's still considered one of the best to ever play the game but it remains to be seen if he'll ever take the record again however it wouldn't take long for there to be more competition at the top level because just a few months later Cipher would return to the game a big reason why Cipher and ello came back in 2021 was a new faster way to play the Wily stages it was first found in a task from 2015 but was rediscovered by Shin Ryu in 2020 start by using item 2 on Wiley 3 instead of Wiley 1 which is still pretty fast but saves a bit of item 2 ammo this allows you to fly through Wiley four Spike screens on the first you want to wait until you take damage then use item 2 on the next screen to avoid having to wait for the conveyor on screen 3 you can place item 2 at the top and quickly make it to the other side altogether this saves about two and a half seconds but it is quite a bit more difficult than the old route there was also a new zip in Wiley 3 that saved a bit over a second and a runner named Endy had a new setup for the dog Scrolls that made them more consistent in exchange for a small time loss all these strategies were enough to make cipher come back he knew the record could go under 2637 but just how far wasn't clear he grinded for months and initially didn't see any results but on July 10th he'd have a run that fell behind the world record early a bad Airman pattern slow execution of Biggie and no frame perfect zip on quick but he saved it all back and more in the Wily stages the Wiley 3-zip the new Wiley 4 route it all combined to save him several seconds [Music] yes oh my God for the sixth time he had set the Rockman 2 world record but you know something interesting about Cipher despite being one of the best to ever play the game the longest any of his previous five records ever stood was four months he was often the first to break a long lasting record but for each and every world record he set someone else would beat him shortly after this 2634 was a nice Improvement but it wasn't perfect he did lose a lot of time early on there was only one way for Cipher to guarantee he wouldn't be beaten get a perfect run [Music] oh don't tell me the pace of mind please [Music] all right this is it [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] yeah that's hilarious it was on Pace for 26.26 Cipher was set up to get the game's biggest record cut in eight years but he went for an extremely quick kill on the alien that's far harder to execute than normal it was supposed to look like this it's the first time I ever did it it would have been his ultimate run it would have been the culmination of a nearly decade-long Journey but it wasn't meant to be and to this day he's still searching for it as for his fastest completed run his 2634 it would go on to be Cipher's longest standing world record it remained on top for seven months but it's not where the world record stands today that honor goes to cool kid on February 3rd 2022 cool kids set the game's current world record it got off to a great start with a fast Airman fight and clean clashman stage from there to the finish it continued on a steady Pace never pulling way ahead of the record but also avoiding any catastrophes he lost a bit in Wiley 2 from picking up health and had to wiggle a bit in Wiley six [Music] I don't know if he's fast enough it was fast enough cool kid and to this day this run remains as the world record as far as this game has come its future is still wide open a sub 2630 is on its way but as players improve and new strategies are developed even lower times will become possible cool kid and Cipher are the two most likely to take it there but who knows who may come along in the future there's certainly a lot of possibilities the top 8 runs on the leaderboard are each from a different country regardless this game still has a long history yet to be written thanks for watching [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
