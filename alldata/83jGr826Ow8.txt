is the keyron Q5 Max the Ultimate keyboard for developers today we're going to find out I'll talk about all its features how it differs from other keyboards it also has a knob I have an opinion about the knob I'll talk about that later a disclaimer keyron doesn't sponsored this video I'm not paid by keyron to do this review they also don't get any input on the contents of this video they did send me this keyboard for free now before we start make sure to check out my new Weekly Newsletter called Friday loop I love that name it is all the latest iron CS news and other interesting things happening in the software industry sign up for free at the Friday loop.com I've been a Kyron K2 user for several years this one has tactile gatron Brown switches this was my first 4A into mechanical keyboards on a modern computer in a distant past I did use a commodor 64 keyboard which is partly mechanic as well as older IBM style keyboards I also tried the keyron K3 I like the lower height of that but didn't really like the feel too spongy the build quality of the flatter keyboard switches also wasn't great in my opinion the keyron Q series is a very different story this is one of the most expensive keyboards that keyron offers cost $219 when you buy directly from them other retailers might offer this at a different price you can get this in a few different colors and switches as well the keyboard has an aluminium body PBT key caps and this one has banana switches which are tactile switches that are supposedly an improvement over Brown Brown switches they're hot swappable why are these called banana switches might be the color there are no real bananas in this keyboard at least I didn't smell anything it's not very consistent though why would you call these banana switches and not yellow switches if you call this a banana switch the red switch should be called a strawberry switch and the brown switch a rotten apple switch now this keyboard also has an RGB backlight it has Bluetooth connectivity but the special thing about the Q series is that it has 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi there's a switch to go between Bluetooth cable and off you can also switch between Windows and Mac settings and there's a USBC port for charging and for regular cable connection this has a 4,000 Mah hour battery that offers up to 180 hours of wireless working with the RGB backlight off or up to 100 hours with the backlight on it has 1,000 HZ pulling rate it's programmable with qmk and VR this keyboard has a double gasket design this means that it has silicone gasket between the top and bottom cases which reduces metal resonance and pour on foam gaskets around the keyboard plate which makes the plate flexible for typing on top of that the keyboard has acoustic foam for sound dampening and there's a knob that I'll talk about later in my opinion this keyboard sounds great it's one of the quietest mechanical keyboards I own and my co-workers love me for it the keyboard is way quieter than my key Chron K2 and it's also quieter than my newy a75 even though that still sounds pretty good to me of course if you want something really quiet you probably shouldn't get a mechanical keyboard but instead op for something like the Logitech MX keys or an apple magic keyboard in terms of feel though I really like the Q5 I actually like the banana switches they need a bit more pressure than brown switches but not too much the is noticeable but it doesn't bother me now the build quality this is built like a tank it's all metal it feels really solid it's also very heavy though it weighs over 2 kg if you plan to move around a lot with your keyboard for example using it both at home and at your office I wouldn't recommend this it's heavier than most laptops can you hit an intern over the head with this you can but it might be a bit much so uh I wouldn't do that actually a limitation of this keyboard is you can't change the height and this is a bit high it's a general issue with key CRS again this doesn't bother me but you might want to get a separate wrist support with this keyboard now let's talk about the layout I like the overall layout the arrow keys are placed a bit lower as you can see right here and that makes them easier to find when you're typing I also like the largest shift button on the left and that the back tick is the key right here below the Escape key and not like here where it's harder to find so these are the typical things that I like in a keyboard for software development M and while you're developing that software you might want to check out my free architecture checklist at the link below if you want to build complex systems and host them in the cloud there's a lot you need to think about the checklist helps you take off the important things and contains a ton of practical tips and mistakes to avoid iron codes SL checklist the link is also in the description of this video a nice touch is that the F and J Keys as well as the five key on the numerical keyboard are slightly deeper than the other keys so it's easier to find where your hands should be placed what I don't particularly like is the enter button it's a bit small I prefer a larger style button like on the Logitech MX Keys keyboard another nice thing about this keyboard is that you can basically customize everything and use the via app which is a webbased app to control the settings of your keyboard you can change the way that the keys are mapped and lots of other things it's really cool now that brings me to the knob I don't like it I mean you can use this to for example change the volume or press it to mute and unmute that's the default Behavior but it's kind of hard to turn because it's very close to the other keys and when I look at the other keyboards that keyron offers with this knob they all seem to have very little spacing between the knob and the other Keys you can sort of turn the KN by moving it like this uh it doesn't feel natural though I I find the volume buttons or function keys to be perfectly adequate when I want to change the volume or mute I typically always reach for those I never used the knob another thing is that in particular for software developers in my opinion there are not that many use cases for a continuous adjustment knob apart from a few gimmicks for example I haven't gotten that working but it would be fun to use this knob to control the type strictness of vs code I want more type strictness punish me I mean maybe this knob is useful for video editing to scroll through a timeline or if you're a musician and you want to control a sound effect with it honestly though for software development I don't see a good use for this not but what do you think what would you use this for let me know in the comments and please keep it civil now overall I really like this keyboard in my opinion this is a great option for software developers the layout works well for software development though if there was a version of this keyboard without the knob and a larger Enter key that would be even better it's not cheap but you do get what you pay for it's a solid build feels and sounds great lots of connection and customization options it's a keyboard that you'll enjoy for for many years myself probably I prefer the slightly smaller and lighter Q3 Max as I don't need the numerical keyboard I still also like the newo for its Sportability but the keyron Q Series overall feels more premium if you enjoyed this video and you want to hear more of me rambling about keyboards then check out this video as well where I dive into several other keyboards and else talk about the things I think are importance in a keyboard for software developers thanks for watching and take care
