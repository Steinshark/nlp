good [Music] luck o E4 so if I play uh E5 you will play your night you don't know you don't know you don't know anything about me Sager stop pretending I'm going to play your kokan against you oh yeah nice I know I know every opening I used to um when I when I used to teach kids I used to tell them I know every opening in chess and they were like what I thought it was very funny um it's not that impressive to know every opening what's impressive is knowing every opening well yeah but you know these tricky lines are always I don't know uh flood I don't know what's happening because I can I can go and win a on but then you have some I'm sure you have something let's see what's there oh isn't this what Eric Rosen used to play or not I don't know who that is who's that never heard of never heard of him in my life so let's risk it wow and let's see so bold is this very bad I have no idea this is as far as I know I uh forgot everything but it must be good compensation yeah yeah it looks pretty good right I don't know it's the problem nowadays you know you just have to know so many openings that's why freestyle chess yeah no no no no freestyle chess is okay for a little bit okay I mean I'm pretty sure I have to go here but maybe [Music] not Saga you know people ask me all the time if I'm going to be GM yes but aren't you much closer why are why why don't they ask you about it people ask me all the time I see and uh then I figured out the right answer to it okay it's like it should really uh make me feel like I want to become one there's no other reason why I would pursue okay and so uh this is the main thing okay you know that she's good I'll let you think yeah I'm a little bit worried about this queen G3 business [Music] um Al my Bishop on C oh this this very good compensation thank I did it myself actually you did it to yourself but get my style of Chess really stupid position nice nice [Music] opening I don't know let's see what can I do I need my Bishop out just don't flag yeah okay let's try to get it's not it's not pretty I I know this but oh my God that move looks like completely horrible but it might be totally fun I don't know it's not good okay proba Sager yes I'm very sorry for this move [Music] whoa does it only look nice or is it really nice I didn't see a defense but I'm very bad at this part of the game making a very very nice move and then it looks pretty good to me though let fun one I think so but I think I have a good move here no maybe not I need to make a mo I know I couldn't find one like honestly not that long yeah I guess I mean just lost right like I is it really just winning hold on I I'm not trying to rub it in I'm just like fascinated I was staring at your position I was looking at a bunch of different moves and I was going to go here yeah this I I saw this and also was very strong uh I was going to play um I think you just have to go back to D7 with the other Knight right no no no I thought I give up some material like I'll this then you take take take I do this and then okay I mean must be bad maybe it's not losing no it's terrible but yeah I just got a horrible position yeah I shouldn't go into such lines with you no no don't yeah you can't you can't wow Bishop do you want to play one more of I want to play like 10 more after that game I want to play the whole night okay yeah I don't think this is a it might be a user do you and uh Tanya have similar playing Styles no maybe maybe she's uh I think she's more aggressive perhaps but yeah I found her repertoire is very consistent like D4 C4 night C3 anyway very classical who was your uh role model growing up I think I took Capa Blanca's book uh when I was growing up and maybe that's really made me sort of go positional yeah like yeah I mean listen if there was one guy in the world to inspire you to play positional chess Jose roblanca is probably a good one yeah yeah I didn't read chess books growing up that's why I have such a perverted chess playing style such a demented uh I play I played what else can I play Sorry night A5 okay oh you thought night B before no but anyway Knight on E7 maybe not the best but I know that for you openings and all don't matter yeah for you it's more important to get a game sometimes last last but last game we played I had a well that you kind of outplayed me in the open like I didn't know the theory and maybe this is your tricky opening course something that you made this this no the one oh no no no that was ah yeah but but I forgot it at the critical moment which is some chesly course that people have to go and get yes yes they have to go and get it um this is a sequel to I am not a GM right here no but we never played we never played yeah we never played but I played with tic yeah you should yeah but then I lost Eric okay I mean I'm pretty sure I have to play F5 right like's shaking his head I'm like I think this position cannot be good it's it's probably not good but then again but show me show me it's not good sagur was very cool when Sam came to New York speaking of saga okay let's put the queen here force you to take hopefully then we have some light Square o castling let's take this guy I feel like you're super shocked at my moves but I feel like they're completely normal moves like I don't have a good position but just like gasping at everything but I no I didn't expect you to Castle I thought we'll go into an end game or something but yeah I don't I don't play End games you know that's why I never I've never had to improve my end games cuz the game doesn't go past move 30 I'm like a heavyweight fighter okay like super fat super powerful true yes but past the first round I'm like a baby oh right yeah not losing right what I'm losing I said I'm not losing right no it's not it's not at all uh losing [Music] but get some pieces [Music] out it's crazy castle see natural moves you're getting surprised I know yeah exactly understand I don't know how to play chess I just know how to you know when I play the pieces just go to the squares you know it's like the moves are in your hand you don't have to think be no it's horrendous but I think King B1 is wrong why I think you needed to play faster oh I'm I'm happy with with not playing faster I'm happy with the pace of the game there's no hurry I feel I feel very close to like achieving something no but this is isn't this like positionally now you are yeah but but how then but then it's uh question like how because I think losing the bishop is really bad cuz your whole your whole idea was to go G4 but now I have a rook on it for I issues I don't know I don't know who this is this is what I love about it's a constant conversation of who's the bigger idiot you know I love it it's great okay so what I'm going to do is uh I'm just going to say everything's good here let's not do anything crazy let's bring our Rook up and play positional chess because uh when it goes to okay uhh know I like that no and see now's when this now's when the self-doubt starts creeping in mean F5 stuff right okay let's do this move no it's okay still no self-doubt [Music] okay I agree but my problem is eally I'll play then I'll play nor [Music] what do I move r b okay what about I kick you away first yeah I thought about that but ah now you come this side huh go let's see if I can win material a little bit stud but it's there all right and now we try to trade one pair of Rooks or maybe I heard it's a colinear move ah nice so you just want to okay [Music] fine it every time I don't know if this is Ultra positional chest so it's it's unfair people understand IDE any I don't know yeah it's so that people are better at I agree with that that's genuinely how I feel I should be better than them with no effort exactly love it I mean admittedly I kind of hate my position you know the only good thing about my position is my night yeah but then I think I'm just trying to confuse you a little bit it's all I have going for me [Music] here okay maybe I confus myself I agree with that this's having a bad day my Rooks are having a bad dayone of your P have got any activity in the last okay let's start [Music] off favorite is yeah I love the what where are you going I'm going with my king no way check what's happening there okay I mean I guess it's just the draw it it's not a draw what's happening it's made [Laughter] no I just got here I was like oh it's a drop but I can force you forward maybe I had to uh not March your king here no this was okay maybe I should have gone back but it was no way yeah yeah no you just I you're losing King A4 Queen A6 maybe yeah it's lost maybe B4 first yeah before and then walk in on the lights first this is yeah maybe this was okay to give the pawn and have this no maybe it's like I think I think once you traded the dark SC Bishop you didn't like it I was not I was not that much worse Maybe
