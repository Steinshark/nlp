and you and I sat surrounded by Broken Glass smoking these cigars and drinking Guinness do you remember at the top of Grafton Street and the thing you said and I agreed with you said you know myth and story is just the best way to talk about almost everything it's the indigenous way to talk about everything it's the classical way to talk about everything it's the Aran way it's the it's the Irish way it's the Russian way it's the Aboriginal way it's what we've always done there's a very old notion I'm interested in which is human beings get made it's actually a process and if you don't have connection to stories rather like a cloak then you are prone to enormous floods of anxiety as you get older as you experience the duress of Life despite all the gadgetry if we don't have this very ancient technology called a story close to hand we're unequipped in some way [Music] this is Jonathan Pedro welcome to the symbolic [Applause] world so hello everyone I am Overjoyed to be with Martin Shaw again he is Martin has been on my channel before we've done some events in Ireland and in England he is a mythographer professor at Stanford uh wonderful writer amazing Storyteller and he is going to be one of the headline speakers for the symbolic World Summit so I'm really excited to be able to continue our our exchanges and so Martin thanks for thanks for coming on oh Jonathan delighted to be here and very much looking forward to Florida in February and so Martin you are are a Storyteller in ways that is difficult for modern people to understand so this is something that I also at first didn't totally grasp and in meeting you I started to understand it which is that you are one of the few people I don't know left in the world not many people that tell stories over sometimes days you know like hours and then sometimes days and you are getting ready now to give a version of The Odyssey yeah that's true Jonathan I'm going to be telling the truncated version from Friday night through to Sunday afternoon really without a breath that's the synopsis that's synopsis uh so I'll report back to you how that went I haven't told it since before lockdown So Stories from a Bic perspective they are erasable animate beings and they require a kind of courtship if you're going to tell them they're not just repertoire they're not just going to show up and so I found that for the first couple of weeks The Odyssey simply didn't want to be remembered by me it had gone into a huff it had gone to the back of uh polyphemus's Cave and wouldn't come out so you just have to sit there with a story and show Fidelity to it until finally it says okay let's try this out but as you will know through our time together I don't tell stories in a kind of recital manner it's very much imagining out loud so um that interest in spontaneity that interest in trafficking in Wild thoughts that was kind of what got me into this in the first place yeah yeah but so there's a kind of a I guess there's a mix between getting the basic let's take the basic structure of the story right you know you know you have the element that you can't transgress that and then weaving through that with a with a kind of improvisation think of it like a recipe that's been passed down through a family and no one is meant to mess with the recipe and for the first hundred times you cook it you cook it exactly as your aunt told you to do but on cook up uh 101 you discover smoked paprika and you don't know if you're a new about smok paprika or not but you can add that little thing it's to do with what they call the sense and the matter of Stories the matter of the story is what you just described it's the A to B to C but the sense of the story is the genius in it and it's it's why three people could turn up and tell the handless maiden but there'd be one telling that you would energetically you'd lean you'd lean to them rather than all three it's not a sort of generic handout storytellers are odd figures who have usually been hurt by the world early on and to make sense of of a cosmos where most mythology is lying in pieces around our ankles stories are sense making devices you know their codes of of a fashion well the Odyssey I know when I told the ancient stories to my kids The Odyssey was the one that just stuck to them my daughter when she was 11 years old or maybe even I think around maybe even younger like 10 11 she memorized the ABC of the Odyssey she knew all the sections she didn't know I mean she didn't memorize the story but she she could tell you what all the narrative elements were and she she did it one time at a campfire where she just kind of enumerated the new the the uh the narrative elements at least of the story uh and so I was really surprised at just how much it stuck and so now and you're rereading it and sitting with it what insights have you come out have come out of that that time well is a strong one uh if you were a Mediterranean Warrior from 3,000 years ago you lived in what I would call a Clos culture not chaos Clos now Clos means imperishable Glory it means your reputation that lives on once you're gone and you remember to a Mediterranean Warrior that's not heaven you're going to it's this far more am ambivalent underworld so you want your reputation to exist longer than you but here's the rub about Clos Clos is in entirely dependent on external validation you can't give yourself Clos your sense of inner nobl it doesn't matter it doesn't really matter there is no you in the way that modern people think about it it is all about how other people look at you so as I come to telling it again I realize we're living in another age of Clos and our screens which are the temples that we now generally serve in and our mirrors which we are entranced in like narcissus we've replaced we've we've replaced what I we've replaced shelter with Comfort religious shelter to spiritual comfort we have a kind of uh alakat attitude towards you know cosmological spiritual religious issues and we just pick and choose what we want so that's been the strange thing and it often happens with the story there's a reason why the Odyssey has now been remembered an active Act of remembering for what 2800 years something like that it's because the Odyssey is happening every day the issues that are going on in it are Hardy perennials they don't go away so the Clos thing has been big for me and so when you say that we that that we live in this new age of Clos you mean in terms of the say the likes and the the the kind of this this kind of outer approbation of our of our of our existence let's say like we need to we need to be seen by the world we need to show ourselves on Instagram and to to have that kind of is that is that what you mean yeah yeah it's a kind of anti John of the Cross it's an anti- still Small Voice these days if we even get in touch with our still Small Small Voice we may be getting fake news from our own psyche because we because we don't tell stories anymore we don't actually do it in the jaw what they call the me Hall of the jaw then stories remain as there's a poet called Friedrich haland and he says Gods be careful you have become decorations in their poems and the reason it's good to tell stories orally is the stories stop becoming decorative or witty they bring their troubles right to your door and they start to do the work that can only be told when you you actually involve it so kudos to your daughter kudos to my daughter who when she was about eight knew all of wolf ran Ving back's paral and I implore everybody I'm so thrilled with what's going on with symbolic world and this whole network that's happening YouTube has become a really interesting place my my one petition would be that when people study a story with you they go away in small groups and tell it to each other just try it out take a risk maybe there are myth tellers amongst you that's an interesting idea we're doing now a kind of intense reading of baywolf with Richard Roland uh and it's and it's really insightful because it's something like a Christian reading of B trying to help people see the Christian cosmology that a lot of the scholars actually can't see because they don't know the Book of Enoch and all these weird traditions in Christianity um but it's a good idea to then maybe take that and be able and and then retell baywolf I I used to do it too I I actually memorize the elements of baywolf and would tell it like at at the campfire we we we'd have this these storytelling at the campfire try to kind of get into the the story yeah I I I'm by the way I'm very interested that you and Richard and thank you for introducing me to Richard's work the man has a a mind as big as a prairie he's fantastic and the two of you together wow from next week on substack all the way to Christmas I am telling the Icelandic Saga of King kol kraki which is the dark twin of bearwolf it's it's darker than bearwolf okay uh just as a just as a uh just in case people were wondering what paganism really look like if voila there you go and that so that's but that's an Insight that you just before we started recording you mentioned something about that you said that you feel like the world is becoming Pagan again but with some differences I think the world is turning the world has to turn Pagan because atheism atheism is simply too depressing and I think the argument of rationality and in uh rationality and irrationality that's been a big religious argument over the last 100 years I think to some degree we're past that now I think people are aware we all serve some kind of Temple and wherever we put our attention for any of time if we look at it in a certain way we afford it enough significance it becomes holy to us that's what happens but I think we are becoming Pagan but without without the influence of the Olympians without the wisdom uh of those you know um those beings that direct and inform those stories uh so I'm not advocating for it but Clos is a pagan response to the world Clos is a pagan response to the world imperishable glory is what was going on in Greek and Roman myth therefore I see through you know being a father and having a teenage daughter what is coming at her in endlessly through social media is an attempt to create just that kind of thing yeah one of the things that I've been thinking about in terms of the Odyssey you know I I've been thinking that it is very appropr to this time now because the Odyssey is this desire to return home you know the the sense of being a drift being kind of you know moving around without without having an anchor and and you know encountering all these strange principalities and the strange women and all of this all of this stuff but then with this desire to kind of return home to to the Hearth and so it feels like it's an appropriate it's an appropriate story to tell today because we all seem to feel that we have this we feel alienated we feel like we don't have a place to stand and that we don't even know where to look at least for now where to look to find that home again yeah now you and I coming from an orthodox background would have the same take on that probably that CS Lewis did which is you're really that nostos that's the word the yearning that adius has for itha is nostos in Welsh it's called hith it's this it's homecoming but it's more than homecoming Lewis sensed it when he used to experience what he in Tolen called northernness it's a feeling it's it's a it's a feeling the yans would call it anima possession but that's a grotesque phrase so forget I ever said it animal possession but the point of it is uh yeah from an orthodox perspective from a Christian perspective that is the Divine World starting to radiate through this one and and call to you but um it's interesting because you will know before you know the other great text from Homer is The Iliad Now The Iliad is not a story of nostos it is a story of War it's a story of a great conflict in the great hero of that era Achilles and achilles has the choice of because his mother is a a goddess he knows things about his life he should not know and one of the things he knows is he has a choice do I want a small life filled with Clos or do I want a long life but absolutely obscure and he goes down the James Dean Jimmy Hendrick dead at 28 route you know yeah yeah but um but I'm fascinated by this because in now the the first time we met we ended up talking about the Odyssey and mid conversation with you I had a thought that I will now repeat because it's significance to me I think in The Odyssey we hear an echo of the arrival of Christ of foreshadowing and the reason why is it's when adius goes to the underworld and he bumps into Achilles who does not have good words for him but he asks Achilles how's this Clos working out for you down here in the dark and and achilles says sooner be a slave to a poor man than King of the underworld now that is that is an antios move and as far as I can tell the Beatitudes The Sermon on the Mount the sheer weird aido countercultural moves of Christ turn all of that on its head you're hearing what 18800 years or something no 800 really I suppose with Homer before Christ you're hearing the end of one age and the beginning of another what's so mindblowing for me is you know capernum was on a trade route so it's possible that a you know can you imagine the Jewish boy is hearing some of these stories not as the Odyssey but he might have heard fragments of them I'm not saying they influenced him it's just a mindboggling thought yeah to think that that would be part of the same kind of Storytelling world I've also seen in in odius when odius returns home and he he dresses as a as a beggar basically as a as a beggar and then he with he wants it seems like he wants his son to recognize him through he wants the people that he loves to recognize him possibly through the the disguise or or or he's using the disguise to get back into to the house there's something about that also about Christ who who comes as who is this King who's hiding in the in the lowest the lowest image you could say I don't know if you've ever thought about that yeah more so recently than before you know the last time I told this story I was a screaming Pagan romantic so a few things have changed in the last 5 years one thing I'd say though is all of the trouble that odys gets into is because of when he blinds the Cyclops the Cyclops says to him who did this and adicus can't bear leaving without announcing his achievement and when he says that the cyclops's father Poseidon says right I've got a zip code for edicius now he's done and again in a reversal of Clos yeah the only way adicus can return to Ithaca he leaves as somebody and he returns as nobody and it's only through that shift does he finally display that wonderful word metis his particular wit his particular cunning to get through being contact with his son tacus speak to Penelope and then all the Mayhem that then goes on but that Christ connection is is really interesting yeah well I mean it's interesting in the sense but obviously Christ didn't have that other part and you can see that in you can see that in Christ you see the opposite which is it's interesting because Christ hides his divinity during the story he actually he always says people and heals people and says don't tell anyone you know you know don't tell anyone what I did this weird this and it it's only as he gets closer to his crucifixion and it's in the moment when he's basically been beaten you know he's been tortured he's bloody and he's standing there in front of the the judges in front of the the Sedin and then he says you know like I'm that I'm the son of man basically it's like and you know the high priest rips his vestment but it's like in that it's it's almost like a very different than the story of adicus which is that first he hides it and when he reveals it it's in the worst possible moment it's like it's in the moment where you're a prisoner and you've been completely humiliated and now you say I am the son of son of man it's it's a wild it's a wild reversal yes and it's why as a mythologist I just avoided my my root system I avoided Christ for 50 years because he was nonsensical to me it's not difficult for me to fall into a kind of biological resonance with the great Heroes of the earlier story stories but Christ is a much more thin skinned pressurized kind of individual do you know it's funny because I'm a Storyteller whenever Christ says don't tell anybody in my mind in a fairy tale whenever you say don't do that it means who that uh now I don't think that's what he meant but I I always smile at those moments because there's nothing more that will be quickly disclosed you know that's a that's an interesting point to think about like it could be part of the the some of the deep ironies that Christ manifest you know like there they they appear especially in the crucifixion but there are these deep deep ironies in his story where you know he he he's humiliated but is treated like a king at the same time so it's possible that when he says that he's it's almost like he's saying you know here's a seed you know keep it keep it safe and then it grows and it starts to grow and it starts to to you know I mean this is this is very much your bread and butter you know your your bread and beer in terms of what you love but the the shock of coming to the Bible profoundly in middle age and recognizing it's this kind of echo chamber where everything is talking to everything else all the time and nothing is wasted there's not a line in the book I can find that is wasted now there are things I struggle with constant I think you're supposed to I I I think that there's something about scripture which makes it that there are some St it's like you you can see exactly what you said you can see all of these things connecting and you can notice that there's this giant web of references that are that are going backwards and forwards and so you you trust it but then you come to some bit where you know in the Book of Judges the man who cuts his his his uh his mistress into pieces and sends it off to the tribe it's like there are some bits that are so crazy and and you know that this probably is hiding a very deep meaning because everything else is but you can't you can't catch it you know it's painful no and I think as modern people we're wired to like or dislike characters we like strong signals about who's good who's bad what's going on and then the Bible has these stories where supposedly good people suddenly do very strange uh things know David is one of them uh I'm telling this story uh The Saga of King hulf kraki right through the Autumn this deep Icelandic tale there's no comedy value none in fact in the sagas if there's too much comedy in you can be sure that that is a a continental influence that's not that's not how the schools would have told it but there's this one character called halty the magnanimous who lives in a bone p he's the only guy remotely approachable the rest of them are just Berserkers and then just as you're starting to like him he bites his girlfriend's nose off in an argument and continues talking to her crunching up her nose and saying well you know I I think this is I think this is it for me and you I'm just not feeling it anymore and and my heart sunk at that moment because I thought halty the magnanimous was all I had you know he was my only moment of warmth in this this this thing and so the Bible can be like that for me and the the way you know I I I find it an act of will sometimes to remember the Bible it's as if the stories they sort of test you they almost want you to forget them they want you to remember them I'm just improvising this as I'm saying that to learn a story from the Bible is like when I'm in Divine Liturgy and father borius serves me that bit of bread soaked in wine that looks all all to the world like a piece of meat you know all to the world like a piece of meat and I'm suddenly in this kind of living iconography you know I'm changed it's amazing I don't do you experience this at liturgy I eat the bread this tiny bit of bread and I am no longer hungry MH I noticed this again and again I'm always hungry obviously I've been fasting since Vespers and I get in there and I eat and I this tiny thing but because of what is what it is it is subsumed in it has this miraculous effect yeah in the story of the Saints you have that you have story crazy stories of saints that live only from the Eucharist wow I didn't know that's all they eat yeah there there are some wild stories sometimes it's like once a year or something like some really crazy story about eating the ugas once a year and surviving all through but there's it what you said about the scripture there's something there's something about the scripture stories which it's also because they've been so glossed that sometimes we kind of see them through the gloss which is not bad because the raw stories are sometimes a little too much to deal with but uh you can actually read all the Bible stories from multiple points of view very much like you could read The Iliad and and you know sympathize with the the Trojans and so you can try to read the story so I you know read the story of Abraham and real and read as if Abraham is not the not a hero at all and you'll see that the the story will tell itself and will make sense and you can do the opposite so there's this weird thing about the story and it's very algebraic that's why it's difficult to remember because a lot of the more ancient types of epics they have descriptions and they'll have they'll be like these poetic types of uh you know description of emotion there's none of that in the Bible the Bible is just like this happened this happened this happened this happened you know and so it's more difficult to but once you see the pattern you realize how powerful it is it just takes more at least for our minds to pierce them yes and you have to be careful because once if you are a chapter and verse Christian and you have so sort of calcified your imagination to the point where that is the only legitimate way those stories are can be can be told or even chanted in our tradition not even told God forbid the intonation of your own voice and expression could come into it you know this is Martin Luther territory uh so so it that has been a struggle for me is how far in I mean the great the great way in recently has been I've been telling and will be continuing to tell the story of Joseph in Egypt as an underworld descent story Joseph in the Underworld I've been telling the story of job as the opening of what I call the Wonder ey where actually I think although we think we're loaded up with questions for God of course in that story in the end God doesn't answer any of job's questions but he does say come have a look behind the veil for five minutes and then let's see then let's see how chat you are um so I'm F I'm finding my way into it I'm thinking a lot about the story of Samson at the moment and others so it's working but um you're he take oh man this story of Samson is it is some I think one of the church fathers said that the story of Samson is the closest story to Christ in the Old Testament uh and that's a that's a but you have to just see it through the right lens which is Samson is trying to join with the stranger that's what Samson is trying to do and so he's this weird character that is moving towards he's trying to join the margin and the center right he takes the door and brings it up to the top of the hill that's basically what Samson is trying to do but he keeps messing it up right he finds he finds honey in the dead line that's what Samson is right but it's like but at the same time he he can't hold it together and then he has to he has to kill himself that's in the the the the the honey in the lion just as the the the sheer unintellectual power of that image there's got to be a Christian group called Lion's Hunter or something it just it just begs it just begs for it but it's it's I mean I I came into stories and I came into myth when I would have been in my early 20s I'd L them when I was younger but I ended up living in a tent for four years I don't know if we've ever talked about this I ended up it became important to me in the late 90s when I would have been in my mid-20s to see if there were any real pockets of British wilderness left so I took off in a black tent without a phone or a computer and effectively to the outside well to some degree disappeared for four years and I just wanted to be absolutely undomesticated I wanted to find what there's an Irish philosopher John moratti calls it your bush soul and so when I went through that experience I found the best way to talk about it without the use of eye statements was these old stories you and I we were once in you and I once went walking in Dublin late at night and every single person we passed was hurling bottles around I don't you remember they just bottles smashing the whole the whole town was in what you call shamini says we are approaching Jubilation they hadn't got to Jubilation but they were approaching it and you and I sat surrounded by broken glass smoking these cigars and drinking Guinness do you remember at the top of Grafton Street and the thing you said and I agreed with you said you know myth and story is just the best way to talk about almost everything it's the indigenous way to talk about everything it's the classical way to talk about everything it's the aruan way it's the it's the Irish way it's the Russian way it's the Aboriginal way it's what we've always done in the there's there's a very old notion I'm interested in which is we don't human beings get made it's actually a process and if you don't have connection to stories rather like a cloak then you are prone to enormous floods of anxiety as you get older as you experience the duress of Life despite all the gadgetry if we don't have this very ancient technology called a story close to hand we're unequipped in some way yeah yeah I I think that there there's something so if you think of something like an ethical code for example right a series of that's fine we need those you know that they they're important but a story is like a tuning fork you know it what it it kind of vibrates and you start to vibrate with it and you can actually be transformed without understanding anything without knowing why it's happening without without having any rational explanation for why it is you're being transformed because because because you're actually you're identifying with the characters you're you're or you're or you're not identifying with the characters and that's putting you in a space where you're basically it's more like music you know you're more vibrating with the with the pattern and then at some point without knowing it you find that your perspective has been transformed yeah and now what's going to H on that thought what's going to happen in a few hours in my life is I'm going to get 70 people responding getting tuned at different polyphonic parts of the story of adicus not just one part but many it's a little bit like watching someone having acupuncture and they go I'm not feeling much here don't feel anything there don't oh my God that that's that's where it is that's where the trouble is now the thing that turns a myth from a reenactment fair or a seance into something that's actually happening in the room now a living myth is exactly that proximity to wonder that proximity to the story doing its cathon work on you before you've had someone allegorize it to death or tell you what it means one of the things that I liked about the Exodus series that you did with Jordan and our mutual friend James or and others is that I was impressed at how much pandemonium intellectual pandemonium was going on I was so pleased that that hadn't all been cut out and we just had the bits where you were all concurring and agreeing and nodding sagely it was kind of messy yeah and that really is its Saving Grace we you and I and maybe Jordan and a few we should do one on on the Odyssey oh yeah just putting it out there you know of enor if you want to understand how we in the west tick you cannot not get there without stories like the Odyssey yeah that's a great idea to do a reading of the Odyssey and to kind of get go through the the images I would love to do that we should definitely organize it tell me about the conference so okay so the I'm gonna speak of this don't know what I know what the means you know and so I've been doing this now for what uh seven years I guess since 2016 slowly building up a a let's say helping hopefully helping people see the world differently I would say that's the thing that I've been doing you know also in line with some of the things my brother has been doing as well and now what i' what I've noticed is that there are people that have been able to transform their thinking and it's impressive to what extent they have been and I find always surprised because for for a large part of my life I felt like I was a freak that I was a freak that thought in a very strange way and that nobody could understand and now all of a sudden there are these people that are that are thinking this way it's transforming their their they're thinking so the idea is to meet in person you really it's to to instead of just doing this online thing to actually come into the same space you know to to to meet each other and also to participate in there'll be different streams there'll be there'll be a artistic Stream So artists will have a chance to meet each other exchange about their work look at how they can you know use this kind of mythical thinking in their work there'll be one which is more like the home how to include these this way of living in your home symbolic living symbolic thinking in your home life um and then there'll be obviously the universal history path which is you know people moving closer to how to reinterpret history in a way that that connects it with myth uh and then you know realizing that myth is the driving power of History to be honest that without the myth behind the history you know we don't care about these stories like the H the ba the boring historical things have no no spark if they're not anchored in something that is transcendent or something that you that you can care about that's why all the ancient people would connect their story to Troy and to and to the Bible you it's like they they had to connect to the ancient Mythic past so basically we're going to be there there there'll be some music you know and then obviously there'll be there'll be you speaking we'll have discussions there'll be father Steven D Young Who I don't know if you've heard some of his yeah he's amazing yeah so I I just feel like even just having the the the three of us together is going to be pretty explosive uh but then having all the people there it's gonna be great well it is and I've also seen you know you've got Vesper Stamper you've got n you got you know Kar Richard Roland Neil de grade like yeah they're all I mean this is this is I go you know I buy a ticket for this I'd be in the audience if I wasn't on the stage for sure man yeah so know I'm really looking forward to it and uh and in some ways you know I think that this you know rediscovering these ancient way of thinking and and and living that's the key to the Future it's it's not easy to connect it to the modern world sometimes it's it's difficult to know how to deal with the technological world and kind of want to go back into this mythical world uh but we have to work through it right we have to we have to find a way to connect them together or else or else we're going to lose ourselves so we are and and I think I think you know of course from a distance everything looks different from a distance you know a lot when I try and explain to my friends that I'm an Eastern Orthodox Christian a Russian Orthodox Christian right now that's not a popular look in Europe I can assure you uh but from the it looks like one thing from the outside just looks like these odd shaped bble onions and strange looking things and everybody's standing up and what's going on but you get in there you get inside and it's nothing to do with a long time ago that's one of the great secrets of myth myth when it is functioning efficiently is not really to do with a long time ago those stories do not get remembered the stories that get remembered are the ones the day that was not like the day before and when you didn't have endless iPads or even literacy you had to decide what am I going to choose to remember it was a conscious Act of Will and as you were saying a few minutes ago stories like the tuning fork um they do something to you I'm very interested in the notion uh of nobless obl which really translates as if you are noble you have to act Noble and to act Noble you really need to be around stories that externally show you through symbolic images what that looks like uh and without consuming that that uh it's very hard to stay focused on it and so you've been you've been on a path like a bath of massive transformation you know in your own personal life then obviously also even I imagine even your readers there's been change in that world like who who is who is coming none of them left who's who's coming to the workshops all of that and so I'm I'm curious to see you know your the change of your perspective and how it has changed your vision of storytelling do you feel like the way that you see stories or that you engage with stories that changed in the past few years yeah and I think I can sum it up pretty quickly actually I would say uh and I'm moving between a sort of a Mythic and a religious perspective and there's almost no difference in the in the world that I live in myth showed me everything I needed to know about the conditions of living different gods and goddesses show show you the betrayals the healings the strange nuances to it all it shows you the playing field it's phenomenal how to live it was the missing element for me and that I have to say is the Christian narrative it's the Christian story because it's so it actually turns a lot of the myths before it kind of on its head because of this last you'll be first antios kind of thing going on this huge enormous Consciousness where we're not just venerating trees and bends in the river and all the thousands and millions of little Elohim and Messengers that are moving around us we're making a claim that we're in contact with the being that is infused in that but also completely outside of it as well I that was just kind of too big for me uh but in the absence of that my life I suppose up until you know up until a few years ago had the familiar kind of chaotic fault lines of not having that essential kind of binding agent uh that is Yeshua so a lot A lot has changed it's not as if my life hasn't been nourished and informed and blessed beyond measure by these stories but the reality is and this is hard this a lot of Christians don't like me saying what I'm about to say the reality is you know I I'm with Augustine all truth is God's truth yeah and I think that a lot of these stories that could be some story way up from the in it and and they and I respect this they may not want to see it in this way but from my point of view many myths and stories are filled with pin Pricks and hints of this great story and so I feel that I was on a kind of drip feed for a really long time and the thing that my heart was swooning for over and over in these stories was something that I could never depend in defend in public but was actually this sort of terrifying Revelation that actually it was the it was the you know the aan of my youth wishing to anounce itself and I ended up I went on a vigil for 101 days I went out into a dartmore forest and at the end of it uh I had a profoundly uh eviscerating beautiful uh unimaginable almost encounter with Christ but in the one place I never expected to meet him I went out there thinking well by the time I finished this I'll probably be married to the wild in some way and I came back married to Christ and I realized that both both of these these weddings are facing each other it's a strange thing to say as someone I'm not a classicist we're talking about the Odyssey I'm not a classicist um in England if you're a classicist that's kind of connected to a class system really connected to a certain level of school that you would have gone to I didn't go to schools like that but I have a real experience understanding and many decades long involvement with uh indigenous and shamanic stories oddly then much much closer to Christ figures than ones that you get in the west they understand very well the idea of the suffering healer they understand very well the one that you're not looking at is the one that is actually kind of binding and through an act of love and sacrifice bringing new life to the tribe so I was I was aware of these things but now of course I see the for example I see you know the crucifixion as the Supreme poetic event of of human experience but I I it was as if I was just not allowed to see it until I was almost 50 it was like this and then God said and now now and and for the last two years my jobian Wonder ey has been opened but for some reason he wanted me to get all this other stuff in me too and so I'm in this thrilling and unexpected M you know what midlife is like you can feel like you've seen all the movies worth possibly seeing so to be in this new world where I'm meeting um I like what Paul Vander Clay is doing you know he's a very interesting man with all his sort of cross associations you see I come my dad is a preacher my brother is a pastor I'm very familiar with all of this but at the same time because of Orthodoxy I've been opened up to I grew up in church all the action was in the Pulpit now the actions in the Liturgy you know the pulpit is the only moment it's the the sermon is the only moment where you can sit down he's like yeah yeah okay sit down this is just me for five minutes and now everybody you know stand orai wisdom and we're off you know so I I kind of know where I am but I also don't know where I am which is a wonderful place to be and I think that with you said you know the idea that in some ways you had to pack all this other all this other stuff in you I think in some ways you know this might will seem a little maybe I'm pushing it and whatever whatever people think but that it seems like to me that's the role that I perceive that you can have right now now in this moment which is you know you use the word the word reing Christianity there are different ways to say it but there is something in the O other myths which in the shamanic stories in the these ancient myths which can can help us see the story of the Bible aresh again because in some ways it's giving you tax and it's giving you ways into it that a lot of people have glossed over through their kind of systematic theology you know like this is this leads to this it leads to this and Jesus has died for your sins and if you believe in him you go to heaven you know that kind of stuff where it's like you've actually stopped looking at the at the crazy things that Jesus does and the crazy things that that are in those stories you you will be aware and I think we have to kind of uh certainly in this in England we have to do our caps to Tom Holland the writer in his book Dominion Tom was the first guy that was saying actually despite the propaganda England and the West in general is profoundly christianized now I go along with that for a while but the problem is we are christianized civically and culturally we're not spiritually anymore we're not this is not a Christian culture and so the Cross isn't quite we got that bit but we haven't got that bit uh so I love the fact that he yourself Paul Kings North lots of others are talking about the fact that we have we can't be taking our cues from a culture that doesn't give a about us anymore because we just get more and more thinned out diluted apologetic we're sort of you know don't look at me don't look at me you know uh whereas actually people I meet people all over the world looking for a Deeper Life and the more we take our cues nervously from a culture that at best has Amnesia if not active hostility to these stories the better but we need to retell them not not uh antha tize them or put in little cues to make them politically correct forget that we just and need them in their pure genius raw form to be to do their work to let God do his work you know uh I think something's happening I have to say it I think something's happening I've never born in the early 70s I've never seen a moment quite as pregnant as this one I've never known so many people talking about things like this I think you're right you know I think that the way that I see it is something like a like an arc you know it's like we're we're actually there's a contraction of Christianity but in that contraction the people that care about it have to do it so deliberately that it cannot be accidental anymore it can't just be something we're surfing it just can't be so we have to look into it deeply we have to we we don't have a choice and so because of it it creates this weird little this this this this smaller but brighter group of people that are can see each other and are you know I'm amazed like you said like you know if you would asked me to predict Paul Kings North and Martin Shaw you know five six years ago I could not have predicted it but then when I see when I see that coming over the horizon I'm like yes that that that's that's it like and I can see that like you said I can see things coming together uh and so it's exciting I mean what what other life would you want to lead it's exciting to be to be in a world that is semih hostile to you but then being surrounded by a round table of amazing nights is like what else would I want yeah yeah I think I think we're all in agreement that church needs to be Camelot again you know I think really and if people people don't think we're in a moment of tremendous Peril they are simply not paying attention they're not paying attention all the ingredients you want for a phenomenal myth are occurring in real time right now you don't need to be nostalgic you didn't miss out there was no other golden age of myth that was more more engaging than this this is the moment and so find your place at the table and I say that to everybody there'll be some kid right now watching us on a phone doing some shift you know his third shift at McDonald's we're talking to you you know we're talking to you Lo locate locate that no bless obl in you and see what kind of trouble you can get into you know
