I'm here with Grandmaster hikara Nakamura number three in the world in classical at 2789 number two in the world in Rapid at a rating I should have memorized before we started filming number nine in the world in did I say number two in rabit the wrong order y damn it all right I'm here with Grandmaster hikara Nakamura rated number three in the world in classical Chess at 2789 number two in the world in Blitz and number nine in the world in Rapid and he is playing in his third candidates here in in Toronto Hikaru to see yes good to see you too uh wow I don't even know where to begin let's start with the third candidates we're here in Toronto what are the uh emotions we're 48 hours away from the start um I think uh I'll be pretty succinct about it it'll either be a very good event or probably a very bad event uh one way or the other I feel like in this candidates unlike the other ones uh not really feeling much of anything emotions wise which is kind of weird to say but uh I would say in 2016 it was definitely at one end of the spectrum I was way too serious uh did everything wrong uh there definitely be players I think who have done that exact approach for this candidates I'm not going to say names but probably have done the same thing or like probably one player who did it in the last candidates who's playing here um so 2016 I just spent every every waking hours setting chess thinking about the tournament in about the month month and a half leading up to the event and I would say that that was a huge mistake when you're thinking too much about the bigger picture of what can happen and you're trying to make sure you have every line memorized to move 30 I mean not always but along those lines uh things tend to go wrong because there's just way too much pressure putting on yourself um in 2022 I would say that actually my preparation I can say this was a bit of a joke I don't think it was anywhere near adequate um but in spite of it I still was in the running uh for the top two place up until the last round when I lost to ding so for this one I think I'm somewhere in between uh between not doing enough and perhaps doing too much but we'll see how it goes when you say inadequate cuz I was going to start there I was going to start in the last candidates and as a as a fan and a spectator right like the last round was a was a crazy round to watch because you were you and ding were half a point apart he needed to win I want to say he got not much out of the opening and it sort of looked like it was you know it was it that was it like that that was sort of the game that was going to clinch the spot but can you take me back maybe to that tournament maybe everything from the preparation you said kind of a joke not inadequate like not not adequate what does that mean like to uh I think what that would mean is that basically you're trying to look at a handful of openings You're Expecting what your opponents are going to play and then you're not looking at everything broadly now uh very specifically I would say for that event I was very well prepared in E4 and not very well prepared in D4 and yet most of the games I faced people were playing E4 on move number one so kind of that that masked I guess uh the lack of preparation some of the stuff I would say um towards the end players did play D4 at this game against dudah where I I was I drew the game but there were a couple moments where it could have been pretty bad uh so it just wasn't it wasn't good enough um but because people played certain opening choices I was able to get away with it now in terms of the last round game uh the opening I played against ding uh this the semi teror this is one thing that I actually looked at a bit but I was never really very comfortable with it either in the runup to the event or the actual event itself but luckily it only happened in the last round and I think because of the situation with ding needing to win the game uh he played a line that wasn't great and there was a there was a critical moment I I don't exactly remember where but I could have uh basically forced it I don't know if it's like a 95 move or 94 there somewhere somewhere in the middle where I I basically could have drawn the game um without him getting any play and I would say that when I missed that and then I realized about two moves later that I had missed the opportunity that was a sort of the start of in my mind going wrong and doubting myself and uh there was one moment later as well where I think it was close to a drawn I spent a lot of time thinking about a very long long variation somewhere around like I want to say move 20 move 21 and when I also rejected that after about a 20 minute think it all went downhill and I think for me um there was also the other big problem that and this has happened in other events even if people aren't aware of it but towards the end of the event it's sort of like I feel like I've done everything I had to do I survived the opening I felt like I was going to draw the game it feels like the event is kind of over now obviously you have to play a complete game um but I just started falling apart mentally and there was actually another example of this uh in the American Cup as well where uh I played against Wesley so and in the finals where I was in the winners bracket losers bracket there was this nimzo Indian game um where he played this queen C2 line um and I was a little bit worse I played a slightly dubious line and he could have put real pressure on me now he didn't do that he played a couple of inaccurate moves game ended a draw and then it looks like you know nothing happened at all and everything's fine but that was also a situation where sort of I just was I felt like I'd done everything the tournament was over and it's all good um so I would say that was sort of the emotion um that was going through through my mind a little bit in in the middle part of the game along with self-doubt against Ding and then after after I missed the opportunities he just played a masterful game I would say once once I missed those two windows to make a draw I I don't know if he played perfect chest but he played very very well for the rest of the game and uh he he was very deserved victory for him is it safe to say going into the 2022 candidates you I don't want to say you didn't expect to be playing for first place in the final game or you just kind of didn't have any expectations period Well I think in that candidates my only goal was to not make a fool out of myself I think uh if I if I go back to sort of the start of the whole process playing the the grand PRI F Grand Prix events in Berlin it was most mostly the same thing I just wanted to be competitive and that was all I was hoping for and I did extremely well mind you I got a little bit Lucky in the canid because I drew this game against eseno uh which if I don't draw that game probably I never qualify for the candidates in the first place but the approach in that was just like be competitive and then the candidates I really didn't know what to expect I I again was hoping that I would be competitive but that was that was about it and the other thing that I think a lot of people Miss um since they talk about how I I could have qualified for the match is that at the time nobody and I mean nobody who was playing the canid actually beli that Magnus was not going to defend his titles so um when people talk about and think like oh I felt like a lot of nerves like yes there was some of that stuff going on but it was not because of the World Championship it's just because I wanted to finish in second place um and obviously I've said this before actually I said this in the FIA interview too if we had known that Magnus was not going to play I I can say my heart of hearts Fabiano would have shut it down he would have gotten second place no if ANS or buts um so uh I just want to play play decent chess in that one um but towards the end certainly finishing in second place would have been really really nice and I think that probably affected me as well as I just thought like I'm going to finish second place it's going to be a great great result and um wasn't meant to be but that's life is it nice to be playing in a candidates where there is no question mark about the world championship maybe there's there's a tiny one but at least it's not will the champ defend does second place matter is it kind of nice to at least sort of be be back to a place of stability yeah I mean obviously there are people who said that D they wonder if ding's going to defend his title I cannot think of any good reason why ding one even if he loses every game gets embarrassed he's still going to get a nice payday and he's he's he's going to play the match I I just don't see any any world where he doesn't so the stability certainly is good knowing that everybody is only playing for first place because I again I think last time around with Fabiana specifically he wasn't sure and that's why he tried very hard to force some wins um and he lost some games that he normally would never lose uh like the dudah game is is a good example amongst others um so yeah having this stability is nice and I think um everybody knows what's at stake and uh you just play and it's a win or take all effectively I'm going to give the viewers at home a very small history lesson because I feel like something like 90% of Chess fans might be from the last four years right but when we look back at the rating charts your Peak was 2815 and that was uh October of 2015 right 201 16 but who's who's counting Point 2015 and then I know you played you played in the candidates the following year um and what I found fascinating about your career was that you played in the candidates in 2016 um but like there was a there was a there was a kind of like a downswing a small period there and then you actually what I didn't know is right before the pandemic like last rating period of 2019 you were something like 2736 which is which is a wild rating for you just as a fan I mean you're you're used to hikaro being 2750 70 80 Etc and then the pandemic happens Co happens we all become influencers and online personalities and now you're back to world top 3 2790 so so that period of time 2020 2021 how has it changed your life obviously as a Creator now but also just for chess the love for the game well I think the main thing is uh the the big the biggest issue with chess and this I think also plays into why people play so badly in the cancer there's so many mistakes versus say a normal top level event is that you're going from tournament to tournament playing and when you have one player who's so dominant the way that Magnus Carlson has been uh like I I'll use myself when I when I was coming up and becoming very good like I was I thought I had a chance of being world champion you're playing to gain ranking spots you think of a shot at that um and at some point like for me I would say around like 20 2011 2012 Magnus just completely started dominating I mean even before that he was already well on his way to that but uh you know around the time that he beat a on which I think was 2013 is it was very clear that that was not a goal that anybody realistically like if you're being honest with yourself it was not possibly become world champion I think that when you have that in your mind it's then you're you're trying to gain ranking spots maybe you can get to number two but there's really no ultimate goal and I think when you don't have that ultimate goal the motivation is very hard to find that I think for myself um because of my talent and my ability for a long time I was able to keep my rating around 2670 27 or 2770 27 80ish um but then in 2019 it all kind of went downhill um and I think that hinged on on a handful of results but I would also say that around that time I started streaming a lot more I think when people look at this event where I lost most of my points in Croatia this Grand Chester and Zagreb uh I I think I lost four games and Drew five games if I remember correctly finished dead last but I was already starting to stream I think I streamed at least probably four or five of those days during the event and um so it just it wasn't it wasn't a good time I was kind of I think of two minds but then um when 2020 and 2021 happened uh I felt very freed I obviously had not played over theboard chats in a long time I'd only played online and I felt very little pressure whereas before that was all that I had playing over the board trying to earn money earn a living these things were were very critical and I think you know when something becomes a job a complete job where you're just traveling like I go to a tournament play the tournament leave day after and then you do it again over and over and over again you repeat the cycle uh you lose the joy you lose the passion for it and I think probably a lot of the top players I I would say that's that's very true for where um I I feel like that period like 2016 to 2019 they they played all these grandchester events all these fed Grand PRI and I mean obviously some people are still very good they're still going to do well but I felt overall the passion for most players was not there you're just playing and it's just like you take it one game at a time but you know you're you're just going tournament to tournament so after the pandemic when I when I came back to it uh I think there were a couple things first of all all these people during the pandemic have been watching my stream uh these top players I'm not saying they're watching every day but they had at least seen it and I know some people like Wesley Hey Wesley um I think watch it very frequently and I think um there is something to be said and this I think doesn't only apply to me I think it applies to other streamers as well I mean and hopefully it'll apply for you too but that I think when people watch uh when they watch streamers or you watch people streaming chess your your your view of the person becomes very different when you actually have to compete against them than it is before because you sort of like I would say with Magnus for example when he watched my stream I'm explaining a lot of these things and sure most people I would say 95% won't pick up a lot of things from the stream but those those GMS are like 2700 plus they watch very closely a lot of little things that they will see and so I think the perception becomes very different of who you are as a player and what you're doing um and then you're also a personality as well so it's like I think they they don't they're not able to like fit you in that box or like view the way they were before and I think that helped me a lot um in my comeback in Berlin and also there's the fact that when you're spending all these hours streaming a lot of people don't really know are you studying chess are you not studying chess these sorts of things and I think all these doubts and all these all these things they've seen like it the the image just isn't clear anymore of of what the player is um so I think it's all those things have benefited me greatly well I was going to ask you you think it's a it's a plus or a minus but you you tend to lean more of a plus uh and what like just people watching yeah I I think it's I think it's a huge plus um as as long as you can do what I do where I'm not playing my main openings I think that's probably the the biggest issue um now now the top players people like nepo or Fano could do the same thing they're extremely good and they could just play random openings but I would say if you're below a certain level you can't do that like you don't have a second repertoire of openings you don't have that grasp of a game um to do it in that kind of way and from that standpoint if you're playing your main openings it's it's a huge uh negative because then people will see your games online they'll see how you what you think of Pawn structures you know how good your opening knowledge is um you know like for example if I go back to when I played Magnus in this famous match I think it was 2009 or 2010 I forget when it was in Moscow the famous Blitz match uh Magnus was able to see that my opening theory was not great we played a bunch of games played a bunch of different openings and I think one of the biggest things that he realized is that my opening Theory my my general knowledge was not great at that time and um he was able to use that against me a lot um in some future games over the following years and uh I lost a lot to him because yeah of that of that Blitz PCH I know I know you talked about it that that really is fascinating that type of stuff doesn't generally happen in the Chess World right like 3:00 a.m. 100 game match or something yeah I mean it it it doesn't happen mainly because I there's just like what's the point they're just playing over and over again what's the point I mean what is someone going to gain like you know for example if I go play nepo 100 games or say I play KCK 100 games there's not a lot that's going to be learned because of the ages that we're at and the amount of times we face each other but at that time uh Magus and I had only played a handful of times over the board um I don't think we really played I mean rap wasn't really a thing back then but we hadn't played much blitz so neither of us really knew each other and so it sort of made sense to play now obviously I said this too I I would never do that if I if I were given the given the choice I never would have done that uh looking back but it is what it is has the online chess boom of let's say the title Tuesdays in the speed chess championships has it made classical chess uh better or worse and I'm speaking strictly from the standpoint of openings because I feel like the last three years have improved opening Theory 15 years like it's unbelievable the amount of things that have been analyzed the Italians the Spanish like all these different lines the the Berlin of D4 the semi that you played like is it good or bad oh I mean it's it's great for me since I don't since I don't have the uh amount of hours in the day to study the way other top players do I think if I were to pinpoint it I think the biggest difference is is chessable I think chessable has really changed the game a lot it's very easy to be lazy and not study and just go buy a core or some because so many strong players have made courses and there are certain things that they can try and hide perhaps like one or two lines but pretty much 95% of what are in their courses are very very good and so that's essentially like I mean I don't want to use the word cheat cuz obviously a lot of people take that in different way but it's a way of sort of like not having to put in the same amount of work or effort that like I had to if you go back like six seven years and so um and of course that also makes it a lot harder for the top players too because now the players they play against are 2600 they're using these same resources and the natural ability the natural intuition that advantage that we have is pretty much gone like if I play against the 2600 over the board um if they know they're opening even if I'm white I'm not going to get much of an advantage and I think that makes it very very hard I think that's also a reason that you see people like leavon rone for example talking about how much they love Fisher random chest because when it feels like the game is so well mapped out and lower players specifically are able to get out of the opening with no problems you feel like what's your advantage why are you playing this game anymore I think on some level what is the future of Chess in your opinion is it Fisher random is it rapid is it Blitz is it classical what's the mix that we're going to see in maybe 5 years well nobody's going to like my answer on this but I think nothing's going to change I I think truth be told I I think f is very very resistant to change I don't think they want to get away from the long history they have with classical chess and the classical world champions in the whole format um and so I really don't think a whole lot is going to change I think they are probably going to be more more rapid and Blitz events for sure but I think f is going to be happy with whoever wins the classical world championship and I I know that's not the answer a lot of people want to hear but I just don't see I don't see it changing with INF F if they were unable to convince Magnus or they were unwilling to do do what he wanted in order for changes I mean while Prague might be good Notre Beck might be good many of these players I think are going to contend in 10 years for the world championship I don't think anyone's going to be as dominant as Magnus has been or perhaps will be and if they're not changing it for him I don't think they're changing it for anybody you think it's better for chess to have a dominant Champion or a big three like a tennis um I think there's some advantage to having a big three uh that definitely I would say is one of the big issues for trying to make chess bigger is that if you watch the tournaments and Magnus is always winning at some some point it becomes very boring for a fan when the same person's winning over and over again so I think having a big three or or like say anyone in the top 10 even for that matter because frankly I feel like if you were to remove Magnus from the equation and I look at the top 10 I think anybody in the top 10 could win a tournament in a given given week so um that perhaps would be better and I think eventually we're headed that route I actually I also would say I don't think we're going to have a world champion who's anywhere near as dominant as Magnus as we go forward I think most players are going to be around the same level so we we could have have a different world in the future where we see whether whether it's better or whether it's worse a fun question for you obviously you you love chess and you're uh I mean I hope right like I you love chess we can start there do you love chess so so it's funny I was I was reading a book recently on Andre Agy this autobiography and there are many spots in the book where it says you know he's forced to play tennis I hate tennis you see this I hate tennis phrase many many times and I would say that I think most top chess players uh definitely are not huge fans of Chess they'll say yeah I do it's it's what I spent my life on I play it but they aren't really they don't really like it that much and I would say I was very much in that camp probably until the pandemic um where it's something to do but I feel like I'm it's not very fulfilling um generally speaking I mean you go play chest RS make a living but it doesn't necessarily feel like you're doing anything super exciting now obviously for me now I I love chess I think the the fact that I'm able to actually inspire people through through the competitions through the content all these different things definitely is it makes it it makes it feel like I'm doing something worthwhile so I definitely do love Chess at this point um but that was probably not true from about 2015 to 2019 I would say so it's changed it's changed well I guess we that we can pause the question there and sort of say you you love chess let's just let's just say it's good that we're having the interview now you love chess and you're obviously well I mean I guess what I would say is I mean I love the game itself I mean I love the game itself but like the structure of the tournaments the the having to travel over and over again these sorts of all these things politics uh I never really never really liked them I still don't like them but all the stuff is much more moderate my my my views of all the stuff is it's much more tempered than it was like in 2019 for but yeah I I mean I mean like let's say just the activity you love the game and obviously you're you're very very good uh What Do You Love in life but you're not very good [Music] at
