imagine owning a car that empties its entire fuel tank just sitting in your garage except you're not even allowed to park it in your garage that is just a tiny Taste of how Bonkers this car is hello everyone and welcome in this video we're talking about the BMW hydrogen 7. by the way the release of which might go down as having the highest number of celebrity appearances of any modern vehicle so we'll check in with various guests along the way so why does this car exist well according to BMW experts agree that hydrogen is the only source of energy with the potential in the long run to replace fossil fuels in road traffic wow wow wow that is a confident statement and apparently one BMW disagrees with so let's get a general overview of the car it's based on the BMW 760i except now instead of gasoline it can run on either hydrogen or or gasoline all right so this is awesome we have a six liter V12 engine and it can run just like a regular gasoline engine you've got your fuel tank you've got a fuel pump and you've got direct injection for your V12 engine runs just like a regular gas car however it can switch over while you're driving seamlessly to a liquid hydrogen tank and then be powered by hydrogen now there's some complications here liquid hydrogen needs to be stored at minus 253 degrees Celsius in order for it to not boil and turn into a gas rather than a liquid so because it's very cold we're going to heat it up slightly before we inject it in using these Port injectors so we have a heat exchanger which has coolant lines running to a radiator and then coming back to this heat exchanger we're going to raise the temperature of that liquid hydrogen slightly so that we get it up to three bar it's now a gas and we're going to inject it into the engine using these Port injectors we don't have a fuel pump so we simply have a pressure control valve which is going to regulate the pressure and then you have that injector to regulate how much hydrogen you put into those ports so you're simply relying on the pressure of the hydrogen which builds as it's heated up and you're using that pressure to your advantage in order to create the injection pressure so we have to have some safety measures in place in order for this to all work out our first line of defense is a very well insulated hydrogen tank so it's not as simple as I've drawn here in fact you have two two millimeter stainless steel cases and then you have a 30 millimeter gap between those stainless steel cases where you have a strong vacuum so you have this really good insulation so that you prevent heat from getting in and raising the temperature of that liquid hydrogen and thus causing it to boil well what if you start to raise this temperature a little bit well that's a problem right you need to vent that extra pressure so this thing doesn't turn into a bomb so you have this hydrogen then vent out so it goes into this heat exchanger sure and it exits when the pressure exceeds 5.1 bars so if the pressure within this tank gets to 5.1 bar it starts bleeding off that hydrogen and the way it does it is it sends it out the back of the car through a catalyst so there's an intake for oxygen to come in you have hydrogen going out and instead of just dumping fuel into the atmosphere your only emission here is water as the Catalyst combines the H2 and the O2 and out goes water now you might be wondering Jason what's up with this flame you've got here so there's actually a second vent as a redundancy for increased safety on the top of the vehicle so this is here in case you need to increase the flow rate of getting rid of that extra pressure within the tank so here's our example say you were to puncture this outer layer of the tank well now you no longer have this vacuum seal so the temperature is going to rise very quickly which means the pressure is going to rise very quickly and so you need to be able to vent out that excess hydrogen right now you're not going to do this with a flame but that's what this is for so you're going to dump out that extra hydrogen from the roof of the car and ideally you know the hydrogen just floats up goes into the atmosphere no big deal but if there were an ignition Source nearby that Were Somehow to ignite that hydrogen well then you've got this little you know flame show going on so BMW created a test where they damaged the outside of the tank they need to vent it all out so it's coming out through this safety vent and they intentionally ignited it to see what would happen and there's a wonderful quote of the results the Flames burnt upwards but the roof line in the passenger compartment did not start to burn until after about five minutes enough time for occupants to leave the vehicle or be rescued by helpers see totally safe so let's move on to power and performance leading us to another beautiful quote within the press kit progress without compromises identical power and performance in in both operating modes now that kind of reminds me of trying out for sports growing up the coach would always say Jason I'm sorry you didn't make the team we're just not willing to sacrifice on power or performance but it's true this engine does in fact make the exact same power whether it's running on hydrogen or whether it's running on gasoline but is it progress without compromise so again hydrogen 7 is based on the BMW 760i which back in 2006 they're sharing the same 6 liter V12 engine the 760i is making 438 horsepower and 444 pound-feet of torque the hydrogen 7 is making just 260 horsepower and 287 pound-feet of torque so a significant drop zero to 60 in 5.4 seconds for the 760i 0 to 62 miles per hour in the hydrogen 7 or 100 kilometers per hour in 9.5 seconds now whenever I'm at a car meet showing off my Subaru Crosstrek inevitably everyone wants to know hey what's the 0 to 60 on that bad boy look I'm a hollow guy so I'm not going to talk figures and I just say look you know what it's it's basically similar to a V12 BMW okay so why is this thing so slow and really the question is why is it so limited on power so the real explanation for this a big part of it comes down to the fact that it uses port injection so why is port injection a problem with hydrogen well if you look at the inside of a cylinder and we're looking at how much air and fuel can we put in that cylinder with a naturally aspirated engine we're limited to atmospheric pressure right about atmospheric pressure So within a gasoline engine if you fill it up with atmospheric pressure and gasoline so that it's at the ideal air fuel ratio for gasoline it's going to be about 98.3 percent air and 1.7 percent gas well for hydrogen that's a terrible ratio their air fuel ratio by volume is about 2.4 to 1 which means at atmospheric pressure within a cylinder if you fill it up you're going to have 30 percent hydrogen and 70 air that hydrogen takes up a ton of space within the cylinder and you can only fill it up to atmospheric pressure so your Limited in power here because you don't have that much air now hydrogen is a more energy dense fuel so it's not a perfect 30 percent offset in power instead if you do the math it works out into having about 85 percent power as a result of using poor injection if you were to use direct injection you could have fill that entire cylinder up with atmospheric pressure then spray in additional hydrogen and you can make more power than a gasoline engine in that scenario but that is not the method they chose here they're using port injection now why is it limited to 260 in gasoline well my guess is they're just doing this so they can say it has has the same power regardless of what fuel it's using because obviously the engine is capable of making more power when running on gasoline and then also this 85 percent does not explain the entire drop in power there so part of me thinks and this is again just a guess that they're slightly limiting power in hydrogen mode to reduce how much fuel it uses so that it actually has a useful range in hydrogen mode because the range is already fairly limited and if you increase the power you take away from that range even more if you put your foot down alright so let's get into range we have 7.8 kilograms of hydrogen stored on board and this is good for 125 miles of range plus we have our gas tank which gets us an additional 310 miles so a total combined range of 435 miles and this leads us to another wonderful quote offering a cruising range of approximately 700 kilometers or 435 miles be BMW hydrogen 7 is able to take the driver and his passengers even further than a conventional gasoline-powered car so here's two things we know are true first of all no gasoline car has ever traveled further than 435 miles second the BMW 760i the core on which this is based on which has a 23.3 gallon tank and an EPA Highway rating of 21 miles per gallon giving it a range of 489 miles and we know that 489 is less than 430 we we know let's move on to talk about this hydrogen tank so why are we using liquid hydrogen well because if you use gaseous hydrogen you have to store it at a really high pressure in order to have any sort of effective volumetric density what do I mean by that well it's 700 bar gaseous hydrogen has a density of .04 kilograms of hydrogen per liter liquid hydrogen stored at atmospheric pressure has a density of 0.07 kilograms per liter 75 percent greater so we can store 75 percent more hydrogen in the same amount of space if we store it as a liquid so that's an obvious reason for wanting to do it the challenge is you have to keep it really cold that leads us to the very cool vacuum insulated tank BMW says this tank has the equivalent insulation as 17 meters or 56 feet of Styrofoam absolutely incredible they say that if you were to fill it with boiling coffee the amount of time you would have to wait in order for that coffee to get down to a temperature that you could drink would be 80 days unfortunately despite how impressive this tank is you still have to deal with heat so as the temperature just slightly Rises within this tank your pressure starts to increase and once your pressure increases above Five Point one bar you start bleeding off this hydrogen and so this only takes 17 hours so if your car is parked for 17 hours after those 17 hours it's going to start venting out your fuel super bummer because of this BMW says you are not allowed to park within a closed space so like your home garage but one thing that is worth noting is that if you do start to drive again you use that gaseous hydrogen to drive the engine and so you bring your pressure back down within the tank so your 17 hour clock starts again but if your car sits for a really long time well they say if you start with half a tank of hydrogen after nine days that half a tank will be emptied and there'll be just a little bit of hydrogen remaining within that tank enough to get you 12 miles down the road I've seen also reports saying that if the tank were full the full thing could be drained in 10 to 12 days days huge bummer now the one thing I was curious about is this 12 miles of range remaining if you were to wait a really long time and allow the inside of this to get to room temperature so you have 5.1 bar 15 degrees Celsius 170 liters of hydrogen gaseous hydrogen that would give you about .073 kilograms of hydrogen remaining within that tank or about one mile of range thankfully you've got the gasoline as a backup all right unfortunately there's one more thing I find pretty suspicious about this vehicle so BMW says you have a storage tank of 170 liters for this hydrogen and within that 170 liters we can store 7.8 kilograms of hydrogen well that gives us a density of just 0.046 kilograms per liter not much greater than gaseous hydrogen we're talking only a 15 Advantage rather than the promise which is often discussed within the press kit 75 benefit which comes with liquid hydrogen so if you were to look at using a 700 bar gaseous tank of hydrogen which stores hydrogen at 0.04 kilograms per liter that would give you with 170 liters 6.8 kilograms of hydrogen so only a kilogram down by using a gas and avoiding all of the nonsense associated with having to use Liquid hydrogen so what's the deal what's going on here well there are two things that I think maybe hints within the press kit to help explain this first of all one of the requirements for filling the fuel tank is that it is under 80 percent full so perhaps the fuel tank can only be filled to 80 percent this hydrogen tank that's a bit of a bummer there right off the bat another disadvantage that could be of playing a role here is that within the press kit they often reference about 250 degree C so if the temperature is just slightly warmer than minus 253 degrees Celsius where hydrogen is a liquid well then your density goes out the window the second this thing starts to heat up a little bit turns into a gas and you lose your density Advantage yes because it's cold you you're able to store it but unfortunately you're losing a significant portion of your advantage in doing so so it seems like realistically the advantage here is only 15 percent rather than 75 percent which is the whole point of using liquid hydrogen now I still think this thing is awesome and the level of testing that went into this vehicle is extraordinary not only did they shoot Firearms at it here's one of my favorite quotes tanks filled with hydrogen were fully encompassed By Flames at a temperature of more than one thousand degrees Celsius for up to 70 minutes even under such conditions tank Behavior did not present any problems with the hydrogen in the tanks escaping slowly and almost imperceptibly through the safety valves now that's a car safe enough for Brad and Angelina to ride in the press kit for this car is wonderful reading material it's 75 five pages and look I'm not trying to brag but I read several I read I read a few of those pages I'll include a link to the document if you'd like to check it out and honestly there's just really cool engineering that is involved with this project so you know despite maybe it's not the most successful project out there I think it's really cool that they put forth the effort took the risk to try something like this that may not have you know a huge chance of success and yeah if you look at BMW today that development path has changed they are still looking into hydrogen except it's now stored as a gas and the power unit is a fuel cell and of course they're also using electric cars if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below thank you all so much for watching
