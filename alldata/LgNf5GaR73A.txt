hello everyone and welcome in this video sponsored by Skillshare which we will get more into at the end of the video we are talking about super nook how can super NOC destroy modern engines so we're going to be talking about what is super nook what causes super nook and are there ways of avoiding it so why do I say modern engines and why is this a problem that affects newer engines but may not affect older engines and really it's a probability thing so modern engines are more likely to have this occur and why is that well modern engines of course are trying to be as efficient as possible and in doing so it is somewhat of an industry trend to move towards downsized turbocharged direct injection engines and these smaller turbocharged engines have very high internal pressures which means very high internal heats and this can lead to certain issues one of these issues being low-speed pre-ignition LSP I and this occurs in modern engines often at low rpm meaning low engine speeds and at high load so high throttle so for example if you're at a stoplight taking off from a dead stop or if you're cruising down the highway in a top gear and you give it full throttle you're going to be at a low rpm and a high load and that's when LSP I could occur and LSP I could lead to super not occurring which could then be quite destructive for your engine okay so let's look at the difference between light knock and super NOx so here we have two identical piston cylinder devices we're just simply going to have a different sequence of events which occurs one leading to light knock which generally won't be that destructive the other leading to super knock which can be quite destructive so with our first cylinder here we have our you know same four strokes as always intake compression power exhaust and so in this first cylinder right here we have our intake stroke pulls in the air and fuel compresses that air and fuel your spark plug lights you then have so that's our first step is igniting that air fuel mixture from the spark plug you then have that flame propagation as that flame travels outward expanding the pressure within the cylinder now as it expands that pressure within the cylinder another pocket perhaps there's a hot spot somewhere within this cylinder gets hot the pressure of in the temperature within of that air fuel mixture within the cylinder is now hot enough as a result of that hot spot being near it that you now have knock occur so you have this combustion event which is not triggered by the spark plug but instead by the heat and pressure and perhaps a hot spot within the cylinder so this leads to a chaotic amount of you know pressure waves running into each other and it's not ideal combustion but because it's occurring after the spark plug has already fired generally speaking it's not all that destructive it's just something that you want to avoid and so you know this can occur in engines and you may not even hear it you may not even notice it and the engine will correct for it to make sure that it doesn't happen by adjusting air/fuel ratios by adjusting timing super knock on the other hand can be quite destructive and so what's happening you have that intake stroke you now have your compression stroke and before your spark plug ever fires you have a hotspot somewhere in this cylinder something causes ignition to occur so you know that could be an oil droplet it could be a carbon deposit something within this cylinder and again it's not actually fully understood what is always causing this pre-ignition to occur but this is that l SPI event low-speed pre-ignition so that's step number one and it doesn't necessarily mean that damage is going to occur yet it's not necessarily destructive just because you have L SPI occurring so then from that little hot spot of course the flame is going to start to travel outward and expand and the pressure within this cylinder again continues to increase then as a result of that increased pressure and temperature within the cylinder now other areas within the cylinder are hot enough that they can combust all on their own and so that's that super knock event and so all of this is combustion is occurring before your spark has fired so you don't have ideal timing you're not in control of when that high pressure occurs so let's say for example you know you could have this expanding outward to this flame travel and then you could have your spark flood fire and then eventually everything could work out and it could be just fine but let's say your pistons on its way up during that compression stroke and now you're having all of that combustion occur as that piston is moving up so you've got these two counter forces the pressure from the expansion from combustion is trying to push that piston down the piston is being forced up by the crankshaft of course those two things cannot happen simultaneously one of them has to give either this has to be able to deal with the pressure or something breaks and so connecting rods and pistons can often fail if this scenario pans out where you have that really high pressure not at the ideal time to push that piston down and turn it into useful work and so if you look at a graph of cylinder pressure versus your crank angle essentially this is time on the bottom and then we're looking at pressure within the cylinder so you want normal combustion is what we have here in red so you want to fire that spark plug of course the pressure starts to rise as that piston compresses the air fuel mixture then you want the spark plug to fire your flame starts to expand outward and then it eventually expands out fully burning all of that air in fuel and you get your peak and pressure and then it pushes that piston down and that pressure is turned into useful work now with light knock you'll see you know similar to the regular combustion except you're going to have that pressure increase a bit more rapidly and a bit more chaotically so you'll have these kind of pressure waves not ideal for it to occur it's inconsistent it's not as predictable and then super knock you're no longer in control of timing so you know your spark plug is firing after combustion is already starting so unfortunately you're not in control of what happens and you get these really high pressure spikes and it's quite chaotic and it can be quite destructive you know especially depending on the timing that it occurs it can occur too early and then you're having those fighting pressure waves even if it's occurring a bit later you will still have peak pressure at an ideal times as that piston is moving downward and you can have chaos occur within the cylinder and really destroy those Pistons as well as you're connecting ruts so certainly not ideal to have this scenario play out which generally is a result of low speed pre-ignition and generally occurs at low rpm and high load in modern engines now if we know that super knock as a result of L SPI is most likely to occur at low engine speeds and high engine loads well then why don't we just tune that out of the system why don't we just say you know what modern engines generally speaking they're all using electronic throttle bodies so why don't we just reduce the amount of throttle that you can possibly give to an engine at lower rpm that way you don't have to run into these high load low rpm scenarios and in fact that is done by manufacturers and they will tune that low rpm so that they minimize load in order to prevent l SPI from occurring but that's a bad solution and the reason why it's a bad solution is because if you look at a map of an engines brake specific fuel consumption meaning how much fuel is required to make a specific amount of power then you will notice that the most efficient area this area I've drawn in green here occurs at low rpm and high engine load so the most efficient region that you can operate an engine also happens to be the engine where it's most likely to run into low-speed pre-ignition so obviously you want to try and minimize tuning out this region because that's the region the whole reason you're moving towards you know these small turbocharged engines that are more prevalent of having these problems is to increase efficiency so if you then have to avoid the efficient region well then you're doing yourself no good so overall you need to find a better solution other than just tuning the throttle in order to avoid super nach so if we don't use engine tuning to avoid this problem what can we do about it well to answer that question we need to better understand the root problem and again this isn't something that's fully understood we don't know what always causes this pre-ignition to occur but one thing that has been linked to it as in increasing the probability of L SPI occurring is the motor oils composition and so how does the motor oil get within your cylinder well there's multiple ways that it can get in there you have oil that is coming down your valve guides it could leak down the valve and eventually make its way into the cylinder you have your positive crankcase ventilation system which could allow oil mist to then be introduced within the cylinder and of course you have those oil squirters which are using squirting oil on the walls of the cylinder and so those Pistons could introduce that oil through the walls up in your cylinder and so these this oils formulation can have an effect on LSP I occurring and so the American Petroleum Institute has created a new version a new specification of their latest motor oil specification AP is and plus and within this specification they have LSP eye testing which oils have to pass in order to get this ap is n plus label and so I was actually talking with some engineers at babbling it and saying hey how are you guys able to change your formula to allow for it to you know prevent LSP eye from occurring and past this LSP eye testing and one of the interesting things they said was that one of the problems has been related to calcium being within oil formulas and so they said calcium is often used in detergents so your detergent will have a polar head and a hydrocarbon tail and the goal of this detergent is to prevent deposit precursors from sticking to you know metal surfaces within the engine itself you don't want those deposits you rather keep them within the oil itself and then filter them out using the oil filter so these detergents have a polar head which could be made with calcium sodium magnesium and what Valvoline said in their testing by switching to a detergent that uses magnesium as its head rather than calcium they incredibly reduced the amount of LSP I that it was occurring and so they were able to pass this LSP I testing by changing the formulation of the detergent they were using to from a calcium base to a magnesium head and that was able to you know have those better results where they weren't seeing LS bi occur as frequently as it was with calcium now as I've already mentioned there are multiple causes of L SPI and it's not fully understood so we can't put the entire blame and the entire solution on motor oil that said if you are running a modern engine and you are concerned about whether or not you may have l SPI occurring one of the things you can do to help prevent that to reduce your probability of running into L SPI is by using a motor oil that is AP is n+ certified now again a big THANK YOU to Skillshare for sponsoring this video there's a link
