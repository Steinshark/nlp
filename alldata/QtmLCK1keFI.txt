this can really help us understand the modern world and can help us understand the modern crisis and i think that in order to kind of understand the modern crisis the first thing we have to understand is that the modern world is not only born out of technical knowledge that is there's a direct relationship between technical knowledge and the relationship with angels this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world [Applause] so last week i gave a talk at a college here in quebec looking at the book of enoch and its relationship to the modern ecological apocalyptic narrative you could say and i got such a good reaction on social media a lot of people wondering if i would put it up not realizing that it was in french i decided i would make a virgin for the english channel which will be a little more detailed a little more focused on some of the details from the book of enoch and how it can give us a key to understanding some of the things that are happening to us today and so before we go into the book of enoch itself it's very important to understand first of all the narrative creation which is in scripture because of course the book of enoch is a let's say it expands on the creation narrative and especially on the flood narrative and so it's good to kind of understand the basic structure of the fall so that we can understand how the book of enoch and the way describes the relationships between these fallen angels and the women and civilization is really just an expansion of something with something which is already there in the origin in the fall itself so of course we know that in the beginning god created heaven and heavens and the earth he creates the world and he places adam and eve in a garden now traditionally especially in the syrian tradition the garden is understood as a mountain and that's very important because we're going to see that the fall and the different analogies of the fall will appear all through the text and will also ultimately appear in the book of enoch and what it means to move towards the flood and so in this image we see adam and eve in the central garden with the tree of the knowledge of good and evil there in the middle the fountain at the bottom and we see the serpent around the tree and adam and eve are tempted and it is by desire for knowledge that they are tempted it's very important to understand that especially according to once again not just the syrian fathers this time but also people like saint ernest of lyon there's a sense in which the the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil was going to be given to adam and eve ultimately but the reason why they it made them fall was because they took it too fast they took it through an act of desire it says that you know the woman saw that the fruit was good to eat and so she reached up and grabbed it for herself and because of that gesture of taking it for yourself and taking it in desire that is what will ultimately lead to a fall and as we understand this it will also be a way to kind of understand the difference between the normal christian vision of the world and the more luciferian vision of the world which understands uh let's say the fall even as something good you see that in gnostic teaching you see that even in in some of the moderns like people like jung seems to suggest that that uh there is something good about the taking of the fruit ultimately in the story of scripture god will turn this into a good but we need to understand it all as a fall in the in the moment itself because it is done through a a sense of self-aggrandizement and a a sense of desire a slavery to our own desire which will become the model for everything else that goes about and so we see now in this image we see adam and eve falling on the on the left here we see the angel throwing them out of paradise with the flaming sword which is not very flaming in this but nonetheless and then we see adam and eve working the ground in the garden we see eve uh you know sewing and making making thread we see adam tilling and we see them especially covered by the garments of skin and so we see that when they fall god says cursed is the ground for your sake in toil you shall eat of it all the days of your life for thorn and tooth thistles it shall bring forth to you and you shall eat the herb of the field so it's very important first of all to understand right away the image of the fall because the fall it means coming closer to the earth but in the sense losing control of the earth it's important to see that in the outset god says to adam and eve that they can eat from any fruit that they found in the trees of the garden but now as they fall god tells them that they will that they will eat the herbs from the field so now they're eating from the ground before they were taking the fruit which was up in the structure in the in the trees and now they're eating directly from the ground and you can contrast that as well or compare it to for example when nebuchadnezzar falls in the book of daniel and where you know as he falls god tells him once again that he will eat the grass of the field like the animals eat the grass of the field and so you can see in the story of nebuchadnezzar he becomes an animal and starts to eat of the grass of the field and here again adam is moving down the mountain into animality and in doing so he is now eating the the herb that comes from the ground but he's then also receiving the the garments of skin there is of course the notion that they have to work that now the world becomes opposed to them that as they leave the balance of the garden this unity that they had in the garden they are they bring they're brought about into a world of opposites and one of the basic opposites is now the opposition with the world outside of them the inside outside relationship and the dual the dual relationship that is part of reality now becomes a form of opposition not a form of complementarity we see that of course in the relationship between adam and eve themselves eve is supposed to be the complement to adam the the let's say the the person that accompanies him that comes from inside and now there's an opposition which gets set up between eve and the serpent between eve and adam and of course now in general between man and the world itself and that is represented by the creation of thorn the the the coming about of thorns in the world and so now adam has to work very hard in order to to receive the bread from the ground and ultimately that fall will continue and adam will end up falling all the way down until he becomes the dust and of course the fall is not just falling it's a fragmentation it's a moving down the order of creation down into the animals down into animality and then ultimately down into the dust itself or down into the water which we'll see of course in the story of the flood now of then it says that adam that god made for adam the two nicks of skin i've talked about this quite a bit in my uh different lectures but to recap it a little the garments of skin are the origin of technology themselves that is it's the origin of technology itself that is god places a shell around adam in the world of death he takes adam is falling into the into the animality he's falling down into the the the lower aspects of creation as he moves into this duality but then there is a trick which god can use which is to use those elements of death to also create some a barrier to stop adam from falling further or falling too fast you could say of preserving this kind of moment of of life and death you could say to give adam the chance to change that's ultimately what that's for and so these garments of skin are placed on adam and eve in order to preserve them in the world of the fall and it becomes the very key to understanding technology which is a gathering of the things below to cover us in a in a world of danger and of course at the outset adam is covered by these garments of skin on his own and so he takes a garment of death to protect themselves from the thorns but then later that will start to grow and so the garments of skin will get bigger they will start to become more and more heavy we could say and this of course happened at the second fall now we tend to think that in the bible there's one fall but really the book of genesis especially up to the up to the flood is just a series of subsequent falls and it's important to understand that of course once again in order to understand the book of enoch because the book of enoch describes one aspect of these multiple falls an aspect which is becoming more and more cosmic which starts with adam falling and that fall has repercussions and starts to have waves and waves as the garments of skin get bigger and thicker and there needs more protection against the world of death then that leads ultimately to a breakdown now of course as you know the story uh cain and abel i won't go into the details of why but cain uh offers a sacrifice to god and is rejected abel offers a sacrifice to god and it's accepted and because of that cain once again lets go of his desires becomes obsessed becomes uh bitter becomes angry and through that kills his brother abel now the killing of of abel is now something like a second fall and we need to understand it that way because when we look at what god says to cain we'll see that there's a direct reflection with what god says to adam so he says so now you are cursed from the earth which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand when you till the ground it shall no longer yield its strength to you a fugitive and a vagabond you shall be on the earth so remember now when god told adam he said you know by the toil of your brow that you will be able to get your bread from the earth and now he says to cain it's even worse it's like now it will no longer yield its strength to you it's becoming more and more impossible to live in this world of death the world where there's a break there's a breaking apart between heaven and earth which is manifesting itself in different ways and this of course means that cain also loses his home and adam moves away from the garden down the the mountain you could say and now kane is going even further out from the the garden of eden and will become a wanderer won't even have a place that he can call his own anymore and now opposed to that so you can understand that just like god gave adam and eve garments of skin in order to protect them in the world of death now cain goes further out or further down into the world of death and now he needs a bigger protection which is why there seems there seems to be an opposition there seems to be an opposite uh going on [ __ ] because cain is the one that builds the first city so it says and he built a city and he called the name of the city after the name of his son so i've some people think that's a strange contradiction but it's not a contradiction no more than it is that adam and eve fall move out of the garden and now they don't have a place to protect them or a balanced place and so they have to add this layer of death to protect them from death now in order for at for cain to be protected from his wandering he needs to increase the garments of skin and now he makes them something like social garments of skin and so he creates a wall not around a person but a wall around a whole community of people so we can see the fall becoming bigger and bigger it starts with a person now it's becoming a fall which which takes into account entire groups of people this has to do in itself with the fragmentation of the human person the multiplication of the human person into now families and groups and different individual and different clans which will clash and which will come to oppose each other ultimately as they build cities around them now you can understand that the let's say the relationship between building a city and the fall and the fall into opposites because as you create walls around spaces you are creating harder opposites you're creating a sense of inside and outside which is becoming more and more prominent now what happens let's say what what what if you would put let's say you know you have a you have a house and so you put somewhere in your house a a uh you put a vault like a big vault you know what's going to happen to people what are you telling people when you put a vault somewhere what you're telling them is that there's something precious there there's something worthy of your desire and so by hiding something you also are enticing more desire and so in order let's say you can see it you're protecting something and by protecting it then you're also making it more desirable and so there's an increase you could say that something can increase in the fall which happens by the very process of creating these opposites more and more now down in the descendants of kane you will have the different aspects of all technology all civilization will be created by his descendants and so kane has several descendants we come to lamech who has three sons sorry i wrote two sons he has three sons he has jabal jubal and tubal kane so jabal is the father of those that dwell in tents so even the nomadic people the jubal is the father of those who play the harp and flute so you have a sense of even everything that's related to the arts all of that is also related to the descendants of kane and then tubal kane who is an instructor of every craftsman in bronze and in iron and now we have the creation of weapons of course and so the fall increases as this is happening so here we have a nice little image of tubal kane of jubal and jabal together it's hard to imagine them getting along though but you know in this image they're all together just because they bring about all the war and all the chaos all right and so now in scripture there's that weird little sentence which comes after all of this it says there were nephilim on the earth in those days and also afterwards when the sons of god came into the daughters of men and they bore children to them they were mighty men who were of old men of renown so this is a very mysterious verse nephilim is something like the fallen ones it's translated as giants in other places it appears in scripture of course when the israelites enter the promised land and encounter these giants and so there's a sense in which there's a relationship between this fallenness and the giants and the increase and so a way to understand it is you can also see that there's a relationship between the increase of the fall itself as it becomes more and more cosmic and the description of these great and mighty men think about it it's very simple to think about the creation of the city and the increasing of the body that way what does that create well it will ultimately create mighty men because now if people are able to ascend up these these hierarchies in the world then they have more power and so a king of a city is of course more powerful than an individual his body is bigger so there's a sense in which this is of course what the nephilim or the giants are related to they are now whether or not they were giants actually physical giants that's also possible it doesn't bother me at all whether that would be the case but it's important to understand it more than it is to think of whether you know what it looked like let's say physically or not it's mostly important to understand that there's a relationship between an increase of fall an increase of animality an increase of body as the garments of skin get added and get bigger so you have something like giant you have these gigantic creatures that are very very powerful um and so you see a few images of giants of course the one is david and goliath who is also related to this because the different tribes of giants which are encountered in israel you know as israel regains its territory are related narratively and not just narratively but even in terms of name and in terms of the connection in the text itself to the nephilim that are there uh before the flood i talked about this in other talks i won't go into it too much but it's important to understand that this type of story is there everywhere so when scripture talks about the idea of of men of renown we can understand it as heroes in general and the heroes of course that appear in ancient mythologies any ancient mythology has a sense in which the origin of their civilization of their great cities of their powerful things were demigods that is they were half god half man and that usually their father was a god and their mother was a human sometimes it's the opposite but most of the time that's what it is and so this appears in every culture here we have an image of gilgamesh of course and hercules that are these these uh these powerful men that were very terrifying we all we always have to remember that when the old world talks about these demigods and these heroes they're not talking about heroes the way we understand heroes today but are really talking about heroes in the sense of these very powerful tariff terrible beings and i chose of course gilgamesh because gilgamesh would manifest this power over his let's say uh political body by wanting to sleep with all the women in his in his uh kingdom so he would go and you know on the first night of someone's wedding he would sleep with the man's wife before his the man had access to her it was a way to let's say embody the entire body politic and kind of have his strength and his power fill up the world and so he can understand someone like gilgamesh as a giant in many ways because he was that that being that had a very large and powerful body and was very powerful in the world and because of that was able to to accomplish great deeds now you see the same of course in the terms of hercules was very strong he did all these amazing feats but hercules was a terrible man he killed all his children and nonetheless is still considered a hero so we have to think differently about the heroes and understand that when scripture talks about these men of renown these men that are related to you know the the sons of god that came and had encounters with with uh with human women as this way of understanding it and one of the things that's important to really get as we come into the book of enoch is to understand that there are true traditions in the christian world one is that there were the sons of god that came to the daughters of men refers to angels and the daughters of man referred to the daughters of cain and there's another tradition which is that it's the daughter the the sons of seth the sethites those that replaced abel as the chosen one you could say as the the one who carries the legacy of adam into the future that it's them who now came and came to the to the daughters of of of cain of cain now those two traditions of course they're they're very different in their narrative but they're not so different in their implications they're they're not so different in their implications because they they both imply a fall they both imply something from above coming down and joining with something from below in in an act of desire and in that act of desire it ends up manifesting itself in bigger bodies more powerful bodies patterns from above which are brought down into the world below or authority from above which is brought down into the world below in a way in which kind of fills up the world with that authority and creates these very powerful bodies so although although those two traditions some people might get annoyed that i'm saying they mean the same for us for our case it's more important to understand their meaning and you can hold on to whatever tradition you want that's fine with me but i think it's important to understand the meaning that we find in the book of enoch because it is so relevant to what what's going on today now of course all of this leads of course to the end of a world and it says and god said to noah the end of all flesh has come before me for the earth is filled with violence through them and behold i will destroy them with the earth so all of this this corruption this fall this this focus on the body these bodies that become bigger and heavier these civilizations these cities that are also related to desire remember that that's why corruption fills the earth we're going to see that more in the book of noah how that all comes together is what leads ultimately to the world now not being sustainable anymore and falling apart and so of course we get the flood and noah's ark you know noah's ark is often seen uh you know in the modern world there's like a weird cute aspect to noah's ark where you see toys and you know puzzles and books for children but noah's ark the story of noah is the most terrifying story in scripture you know it is so terrifying to imagine the entire world collapsing under its own chaos and violence uh and ultimately only a few people uh the seed of the righteous surviving all right and so that's the basic uh story in scripture to kind of talk about how genesis the the creation narrative leads all the way down into the flood and so what we see in the book of enoch will be an expansion of this something which will help us understand what are the implications of this narrative that's already there and even as you notice i've teased out certain elements from scripture which to some people might not be obvious on the first reading but uh you will understand that the reason why i'm able to tease them out is also because i've been formed by other narratives like the book of enoch which which were kind of this expansion to help us see patterns in scripture that are there but that are sometimes hard to pick out for some people so the the version of the book of enoch we're going to look at is going to be the first part of what often people call the book of enoch or sometimes it's like different enoch 1 2 3 or whatever it's really the book of watchers which is considered by scholars to be the oldest part of the book of enoch composed in 300 to 200 bc the complete text of the book of enoch was found in ethiopia in i think in the 19th century if my memory serves me correct and the book of enoch is quoted in the early church fathers but it's also quoted in the bible it's quoted in the epistle of jude and it seems like there were parts of it which were found in qumran and different parts of the world the book did come into let's say was forgotten by some people or was kind of set aside by some of the church fathers because of the problem of the idea that angels would have relationship with women and that would create children of course that's very problematic for our metaphysics but i think that especially now and if if you're watching the or listening to the um lord of spirits podcast with father stephen de young and father andrew damick you will see that they have been able to in my opinion they've been able to really help us understand what this means and how it's possible and you know in a way that kind of heals over the the opposition or the the problem that a lot of the later ancients had with the book and the answer is that these were rituals there were rituals between that were set up religiously between a priestly caste and sometimes uh temple prostitutes or sacred prostitutes and that it was a ritualized way in which to embody the god in the world just like they had ritualized way of embodying the gods and statues or you know in the in temples and practices then they had a way to sexually imbibe the god into the world through ritual sexual practice and that this really it really kind of heals it together and it also joins it back to what i was talking about a little bit before which is that this is relation to related to civilizations themselves it's related to let's say religious practice civilizations cultural dev developments and that it's not just about you know it's although narratively we can use the image of the god coming down and having an encounter with a woman we need to kind of expand that and understand it that it it has cultural and civilizational implications all right all right and so the book of enoch starts with a kind of notion of the coming revelation it talks about how you know enoch is the one who's speaking and enoch knows that there's going to be a flood so he kind of prepares the reader to understand that and he says he talks about how there will be a manifestation of the holy one of god himself who will therefore tread upon mount sinai appear with his hosts and be manifested in the strength of his power of heaven as he talks about how all shall be afraid and the watchers will be terrified great fear and trembling shall seize them even to the ends of the earth the lofty mountain shall be troubled and the exalted hill depressed melting like a honeycomb in the flame the earth shall be emerged and all things which are in it will perish while judgment shall come upon all even upon all the righteous but to them he shall give peace he shall preserve the elect and towards them exercise clemency so you get a sense in which he's telling you now what i'm going to tell you is what is going to bring about the end of a world the world is going to end but don't be worried because the just will be preserved and god will show clemency to the just and then what will happen is that once all of this happens there's going to be a strange transformation and then all will belong to god so then shall all belong to god be happy and blessed and the splendor of the godhead shall illuminate them and so there's a sense in which this fall will lead to a final you know apocalypse a final revelation in which all things will now become connected again you can already see that there's a similar version of this in the book of revelation itself where the destruction of the world leads to the new jerusalem we'll talk about that a little later as well and how it relates to the book of enoch and to cain and the building of the city i've talked about this in other videos but we'll go over it nonetheless so what's interesting is that the book starts by describing natural patterns and so we need to understand how the ancients understood and how the notion of the watchers were understood by these people it was that god had appointed on the world these angels that were watchers that were those who were principalities over different patterns of the world they were the combination of these patterns into intelligences and these intelligences manifest themselves in the world through these regular natural patterns and so that's why at first it really it describes just the patterns of nature and it says all who are in the heavens know what is transacted there they know that the heavenly luminaries change not their path see that each rise and set regularly everyone at its proper period without transgressing the commands which they have received they behold the earth and understand what is there transacted from the beginnings to the end of it they see that every work of god is invariable in the period of its appearance they behold summer and winter perceiving that the whole earth is full of water and that the cloud the dew and the rain refresh it so they go on to describe different different natural patterns but what's important to understand is that the way it's described is that these watchers are set over these regular patterns because these patterns are intelligible and they are intelligent they are causal in the world the patterns that we see in the heavens they legislate the different transformations that we see that are stable that are balanced the change of the seasons you know the water which comes down from the mountains down into the ground goes back up and then comes down as rain these types of natural patterns have a regularity to them especially those in the heavens the lights up in the heaven have a regularity that regularity to them so you need to understand that if you don't understand that for the ancients in the old in the bible that the stars and the gods the stars and the heavens the stars and these principalities are the same because they are a manifestation of the regular patterns of god's will on the world and so god's will is nothing but the regular procession of of orderly patterns into reality and so that is what these principalities are uh above that's what they they are the watchers they watch over these patterns it's hard for us to think that way it's it's easier for us to think that way once we see them start to go off key and when the patterns start to go off what they're supposed to be then it's going to become clear to kind of understand them as these intelligences that are acting in the world because you know when they act outside of the script let's say we can see the effects of them because those other effects right the effects of the natural patterns they become like the they just become taken for granted they're just the world we live in they're not they they don't they don't they tend to fall into the background of our existence because they just are let's say the the water in which we live the natural patterns of the world so what happens is that of course you have these intelligences that now fall into the world and they do that by desire they see what that which is below and instead of just being uh let's say a normal let's say in the normal hierarchy of things of overseeing the patterns of being the combination of these patterns they now through desire want to come down and find let's say bodies and we can understand that this happens also from below so the intelligences above you can describe it as them desiring the the the feminine that is below the potential is below and desires to come into that through a desire to modify and to transform the patterns to their own to their own power you could say and another way to understand it is to understand it from below as well to understand that the that the men that the descendants of cain in order to protect themselves looked up and with desire just like adam and eve reached up in order to take the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil reach up and now take these patterns for themselves not only to see them like was described at the outset you know at the outset these patterns are described as good as beautiful as powerful these secret patterns that are there in the world are are are part of the way god lays out the creation but now there's a sense in which people reach up into those secrets grab the secrets and use them to make themselves more powerful and that's very important that it's a repetition of the fall but now it's really at a cosmic scale and it's related to desire which is why there's a sexual aspect to it it's related to multiplicity of beings and also to the creation of giant bodies you know these giant bodies represented by the different levels of civilization and everything all right so so these fall intelligence they took wives each choosing for themselves whom they began to approach and with whom they cohabited teaching them sorcery incantations and the dividing of roots and trees and the women conceiving brought forth giants so there's a relationship between the the union of the intelligences and the women right and the bringing down of knowledge those two things are the same they really are the same they're bringing down the knowledge into a world that grasps for them with desire and so it says that the stature of these giants was 300 cubits which is i think it's like what is like a something like a football field it's like 300 feet or something like that i i think maybe even more than that i don't know it's 300 yards or something it's huge it's it's just it's just these huge huge things by the way the the size of the giants described in the book of enoch is the same as the size of the ark the ark of noah this helps you understand even more what this is about that it is about the technology itself it is about the building of these giant uh garments around us to protect us to give us power to help us act in the world of danger so we need to understand by the way that noah's ark is a continuation of this and the transformation of this into a good but at this point saying that that the giants had bodies that were 300 cubits is to help us understand that there's a relationship between that and the ark itself but what's important is that also there's a sense in which now that these giants have bodies now these giants devour they eat they're hungry they eat the world they devour all which the labor of men produced until it became impossible to feed them and then they turned against men and they started to devour men now understand that you can understand it in a narrative way as these giants that have giant bodies that just eat and eat and eat but you can also of course understand what it can also refer to in terms of civilizational manner you can imagine these cities that devour that devour through the desire of its elites that kind of gathers in gathers in and it also devours men this is of course what even you know the the prophet samuel told the israelites that if they have a king that the that king will devour their children that king will take their sons and their daughters to fight in his war to his his daughters to have children with to have this to sleep with and and their their uh their sons in order to fight in their wars so there's there's a relationship even there in terms of narratively what it is that is being referred to here um and so they began to injure birds beasts reptiles and fishes to eat their flesh one after another and to drink their blood and the earth reproved the unrighteousness and so people notice that these large huge gigantic bodies are out of control and that they're devouring the world and so think about already think about in terms of the ecological narrative the way in which we describe the civilizational problem in which we're in in terms of the way in which we are devouring resources because of our giant bodies we have these giant bodies that are out of control that are devouring resources and are also devouring humans of course you know this becomes clear and clear especially when we look at um when we look at google and we look at social media and the internet and how it devours us right it lives through our attention our attention feeds it and makes its body bigger and more powerful um and fills makes it fill up the world even more and so what's important also to understand is the difference because later in the in the other parts of the book of enoch later enoch will ascend up into heaven and as he ascends into heaven he will himself discover all the secrets of the way in which the world lays itself out it's a it's a beautiful narratively described vision of the cosmos of these gates these gates out of which the different heavenly bodies come in and come out and how they process regularly through the sky at their allotted time and so there's a sense in which enoch will discover these secret mysteries that are referring to but there's a difference between that let's say um enoch ascending up into the heavens and discovering the secrets and now these these intelligences coming down into the world and modifying the world that is what ultimately technology is technology is a modification an adding on of you know the earth onto things in order to make them more powerful so it is once again an acceleration of the garments of skin themselves but now it becomes more and more so it says talks especially about azazel as a zell is important in this and is important as well because azazel ends up in the bible azazel is also in scripture he's the demon of the wilderness to which the israelites sacrifice a goat every year and so moreover azazel taught men to make swords knives shields breastplates the fabrication of mirrors the workmanship of bracelets and ornaments the use of paint the beautifying of the eyebrows the use of stones of every valuable and select kind and all sorts of dyes so that the world became altered what's important is to understand the world became altered and what's also important to understand is what is the strange relationship between all these different aspects of reality he makes swords and knives and shields and breastflights but then also mirrors and bracelets and ornaments and the use of paint and beautifying the eyebrows now of course all of this has to do with metal making it has to do with taking the minerals from the earth and transforming them because of course mirrors at that time would be made of metal and also even the the beautifying of the eyebrows uh was a was a certain metal that was used to um to paint the eyebrows of of women but it also shows you the relationship between power and desire the relationship between you know getting swords and weapons and making yourself more powerful in order to conquer others and protect yourself from others and also the desire to make yourself more attractive and more beautiful through adding ornaments through adding this layer on top of you of paint and of beautifying your clothing of doing all that in order to attract others so you can see that this relationship between desire and power is there by the way right right in the beginning with adam and eve in the garden with eve there at the tree but it also now has you can see its implications in terms of civilization how there is a relationship between all of these together so what this does is of course impaiting increases fornification fornication multiplies and they transgress and corrupt it all their ways unless you understand that you won't understand the relationship between fornication and technology now it's a lot easier to kind of understand for us if you just take a second to see the relationship between fornication and technology if you think of course of uh of contraceptives if you think of pornography if you think of you know this the the the internet and just how elated it is with with eroticism you can kind of see it but you can sometimes it's hard to understand the connection that it has to do with power and desire that is the desire to increase my power in the world to to accumulate these goods to accumulate these statuses that i can get by a nice car or this or that is related also to making myself attractive and also you know say joining with with sexually with things and with people there's this there's a relationship between this desire and power which is unavoidable and which is of course represented very beautifully and powerfully in the story of the book of enoch and this ultimately although it was done in a way through the pa through the desire of these intelligences to be embodied but then also the the desire of men the desire of the descendants of cain to be more powerful what it ultimately does though is it leads to the destruction of men and so you see all the different demons that are teaching different things i won't go through all of them you know teaching sorcery the dividing of roots observation of the stars signs astronomy the motion of the moon and so like i said all of these patterns they later will be discovered by enoch himself in scripture but these are all used to control and to modify reality rather than just a let's say a spiritual contemplation and participation in the way the world is and then so that leads to men being destroyed and it says and then men being destroyed cried out and their voice reached out to heaven and the man in which the voice reached out to heaven is that you have now these intelligences that became deviated that started to want to find body for their own desires and now you but you also have the intelligences that remain stable that remain uh directed towards the infinite directed towards god and so the way it works is that the the voice of those that are falling the voice of those that are being destroyed by this call up to heaven and then you have the archangels my cable michael gabriel kaphel suriel and uriel they look down from heaven and see the quantity of blood which was shed on the earth and all the iniquity which was done upon it and so they hear the voice of them and then they turn up to god and they tell they ask god to do this so the earth deprived of their children has cried even to the gate now it's the angels saying the angels are telling god the earth deprived of her children has cried even to the gate of heaven and now to you and now to you you holy ones of heaven sorry i'm still it's still now the people that are that are complaining to the angels says and now to you the holy ones of heaven the souls of men complain saying obtain justice for us with the most high so they're telling now the angels not to come down let's say and and uh and mingle with them but he's they're looking up and they're asking the those those principalities above to obtain justice from that is what is above them they're saying go up into into the hierarchy and and call upon god for us to now bring justice down to us you can think of it as the way in which for example in the old testament the people would go to the prophet and ask the prophet to pray for them or go to the priests and ask the priest to pray for them and now you can see this at a higher level they're asking up to say intercede for us to god above intercede through us to to god and that's what happens and finally what's interesting is that god finally lays down his judgment and there's an interesting little tidbit in the way that god judges that is very fascinating and can help us understand what exactly the judgment of god is and we often think of the judgment of god as this arbitrary thing that comes down from heaven you know throwing lightning bolts uh just god is angry so he sends down his his anger and there's a way in which we need to understand that that's real that the anger of god is a real thing that that if the world goes against what it's supposed to be if it starts to move in directions that are counter its nature then then the anger of god comes down upon us but that anger of god is the very result of us going away from what god wants it's in the very pattern of moving away so the distortion of reality the modification of reality towards our perversions and our desires is what is going to destroy us itself and so interestingly enough god turns to gabriel and says go to the biters the reprobates to the children of fortification and destroy the children of fortification right the offspring of the watchers these giants go destroy them from among men bring them forth and do what and excite them one against another let them perish by mutual slaughter for the length of days shall not be theirs so you can understand that the truth of these perverted patterns at some point starts to manifest itself and how does it start to manifest itself it starts they start to manifest themselves as their incapacity to exist so the truth of these patterns is that people will fight amongst each other and so god is saying gabriel excite in them this this capacity to fight against another but that's in their very pattern of what they're doing as well in that pattern of desire in that pattern of of trying to be more powerful to be more vain to be more attractive to attract more attention all of that will lead us against each other and so that is where the truth of those horrible patterns start to manifest themselves and it means that people start to fight and they self-destroy ultimately and so you could so you could think of it you know like you know you know someone someone someone who starts to take uh heroin and they take heroin and then at some point you could say you know the judgment of god is on that person but it's just it's actually also just the consequences of them taking heroin that is the truth of that pattern of taking heroin is that it's not sustainable if you do it constantly then at some point it starts to starts to break apart and you know you start to self-destroy and that appears as the judgment of god all right now it's important to understand that this story of these intelligences which come down like i mentioned before the the story that you find for example of the the god the greek gods or the mesopotamian gods that now encounter humans and become the kings and the leaders of these civilizations you can also see versions that are related to technology and it's very interesting because you'll notice that all the same patterns are there so for example we have the story of course of the titan and there's a weird relationship in let's say uh ancient imagination between the titans and the giants although they're not actually the same in hesiod for example they end up kind of all becoming the same these these these these fallen these ancient gods and then also these giants that are the that are the side effect of uh of kind of of relationships that of uh heaven being castrated and his semen kind of falling on to the chaotically onto the world you can understand that these angels that come down into the world and chaotically manifest to bring about transformations is not it's not exactly the same but you can understand how it's related to let's say heaven being castrated and his seeds getting spread out chaotically and bringing about these giants but you can also understand that the titans of course are the first rebels against the god of heaven for the ones who rebel against the god of heaven and prometheus would have been in that clan of those that rebelled against heaven and now brought down the patterns into the world and brings fire to the world so what's interesting is that in the greek myth most of the time it's this is actually seen as positive that this is a positive thing right prometheus brought down the the patterns of heaven into the world to modify creation and this was like you know an act of a desire to liberate humans to liberate them from the tyranny of heaven and if you know people that are luciferian in their thinking even if they don't know that that's what they are some people actually do they'll realize that that's also how they see the fall in the garden of eden they see it as something like the promethean relationship but what's interesting is that the punishment that is given upon prometheus which is often seen as horrible and unjust is that every day his liver uh will will grow and and then every day an eagle which is the symbol of zeus will come down and eat his liver every day uh what's interesting is that the liver was for the ancient greeks was seen as the house of emotions and so the liver was the place of emotions in the body so you can understand that also as the passions if you want is that the prometheus's passions because he brought down these patterns to heaven through a rebellion against heaven itself that his passions will cycle and will constantly be brought back then we'll be taken away then we'll be brought back and will be taken away and you can understand it as the cycle of any passion of any desires of any time that you you act in desire and you end up in this cycle where you're never really satisfied and you keep you keep turning in a circle in a circle so you can see it of course in the story prometheus but you can see it a lot even more clearly in the story of the minotaur now in the story of the minotaur there is the story of pacifi who is the king of the the the wife of the king of minos and the the gods they make this beaut they give this beautiful bull to the king aminos i forget who gave it to him it gets complicated i i forget these the the details but the they have this beautiful white bull and they entice pacifier to fall in love with the bowl and to want to have a relationship with the bull now you can see interestingly enough how it's it's it's inverted right it's it's a it's a weird inverted relationship but it's still very similar it's like this crossing of levels of ontological reality of different levels of principality which are crossed through irregular desires and this irregular desire causes monsters and causes chaos and causes violence and and breakdown so pacifie falls in love with the bull wants to engage with it obviously cannot so what did she ask she asked daedalus who is the great technician he's the great artificer to create a animal shell for her so he creates this animal shell around her and a fake bowl in which she goes into and by hiding herself in this animal shell then she can enter into relationship with the white bull and that's how she gives birth to the minotaur and of course the minotaur is a cannibal he goes around and eats people and he has to be hidden in the labyrinth in order to prevent his he the chaos that that has been unleashed in the world of hybrids and mixtures it's important to understand that um in some traditions the nephilim of course also created hybrids it was part of their it's part of what they were doing so you can see of course the notion of hybridity is related to all of this that is you can understand the angels the ids high identities or these high intelligences that cast themselves down into these lower causalities through desire and so mingle and create um create more and more mixture in terms of confusing of identities it's already a confusing of identity for of course you know pacifier to have a relationship with the bull it's a confusion of identity for these higher beings to mingle with these lower beings but then that also creates these these different uh this different mixture which is at the bottom of the world the place where identity breaks down right the dust of the earth where things start to fall apart and not hold together there's of course an image of that in the in the vision of daniel where you see you know the head of gold you know the different metals of the different section of the statue ending with the mixture of clay and iron at the bottom so you can understand that the hybrids that these giants create and the hybrids that were created by the relationship between pacifier and the bull is something like these hybrids and this confusion of identity which brings about chaos and death at the edge of the world it's of course related once again that i mentioned the fact that in manuscripts you have all these hybrids on the board of manuscripts but it's also related let's go back to the very top of this it's also related to the way in which demons themselves are represented in western iconology these demons themselves are represented already as this mixture and this chaos and these and these animals that are you know birds and mammals and lizards that have faces you know faces on their crotches that are you know they're that are falling upside down all of this is a representation of already this problem of what happens when these identities fall and how they start to break down and to fragment into hybrids now of course all of this leads to the flood which is the breakdown of everything and you know the place in which all of this falls apart identities collapse violence is too much there's too much opposition there's too much chaos there's too much breakdown um and it all falls apart into the flood and the flood is caused by all of these different factors at the same time this can really help us understand the modern world and can help us understand the modern crisis and i think that in order to kind of understand the modern crisis the first thing we have to understand is that the modern world is not only born out of technical knowledge that is there's a direct relationship between technical knowledge and the relationship with angels there's a direct relationship between in the west between this technical rationalistic point of view and this weird esoteric uh angiology and demonology which occurred at the end of the middle ages and start to started to become more and more prominent now you can look into these figures yourself i'm not going to to go into detail but just to help you understand that at the very outside of modernity during the during the enlightenment period you have figures like john d who was the main counselor of the of queen elizabeth who was a who was a magician who was a you know a hermeticist who was all these things now what's most important to understand here that one of the things that he tried to do was to contact angels he tried to have he tried to receive messages from these beings that were above and these beings ultimately led him himself into a lot of confusion and led him to practice white swapping and things with his partner and it just became very weird and disturbing but there are many examples of that you can look these up joseph who was a french kind of decadent uh religious figure in the uh the 19th century who led to what's known as the symbolist the symbolists were a uh it's funny because i'm a symbol it's not the same kind of symbolism but these symbolists were these artists at the end of the of the 19th century that explored the spiritual but in very kind of dark terms you see it in uh painting you see it also in uh in in the music a lot of the music uh a lot of these kind of dark you know the the sabbath of witches and all of these types of imagery were explored by these people of course you have blavatsky and you have crowley who practice sex magic and demonology and of course i've mentioned this before and i mentioned this in another podcast and i mistook the name of of crowley's uh one of crowley's beans which was lamb who he was having encounters with and which and who was dictating uh you know knowledge to him and it's just interesting because lamb looks like a gray and there's a relationship direct relationship between you can understand that in the in the enlightenment period there are some people trying to break through and to kind of recontact these intermediary beings you could say and this was directly related to uh the development of technology these same people were also um they were directly related you can't it's hard to to to get a get away from that but now we can understand the giants we can understand that giants have been unleashed on our world and we see it of course in terms of this armament we see it in terms of the physical corruption you know in the ecological crisis pollution we see it of course with the obsession with hybrids and that this is related and is inextricable from moral corruption now people tend to not want to see those related together but they because of course a lot of people that are involved in the moral corruption are decrying the physical corruption but they don't realize that the desire that is bringing about the moral corruption the confusion of sexual identities and the desire to live out your sexuality in the completely disincarnated disembodied uh you know uh way is related to the desire to increase your power in terms of technology so that you don't have to submit yourself to the natural patterns of the world right we have the electricity which means we don't have to follow the patterns of the lights in the sky we have cars which means that we can spread ourselves out we can move faster we can do all these things which are modifications of nature um and that the desire we have that the desire that we have to kind of engage with that in an obsessive way is the same desire which leads to the moral and the sexual corruption let's say and this of course leads to a destruction of humanity whether it is a destruction through you know people getting sick because of because of pollution because our food is technological and our food is degrading the quality of our food is degrading people become uh you know people use contraceptives pornography all of this technically brought about this relationship between technique and desire brings about a fallen birth rate and ultimately of the vision of a collapse and i think that it's interesting because although i do believe that the environmental narrative is often weaponized by people who want to control it and people who want to bring about their own very disturbing uh luciferian utopia there is nonetheless a reality which is that some of these machines that we've unleashed on the world they are very dangerous to us you know the just the idea of nuclear war is not a joke that exists it's possible that nuclear destruction will visit upon us you know i was talking to brett weinstein uh i think the podcast should be coming already come out by the time you see this but he mentioned you know that there are hundreds of nuclear reactors in the united states that require 24-hour uh electrification and so it's like if the electricity stops they will melt down and there are hundreds of these so it means that there's a man in which we're acting as if we want power and power and power and we have no sense of calculating what this means in terms of the modification of the world in which we live and this is important to understand that now the question to understand now ultimately the key to how this is related to fallen angels and to you know these falling watchers is these patterns they are active intelligences and nobody controls them because we often think that these things just exist in the world and that they don't act upon the world but the man in which we can kind of see that they don't that they act upon the world is that we don't control them a good example is of course the environmental crisis itself which is that although our politicians use environmental environmental crisis politically to spot to do whatever it is that they want to do everybody kind of understands that whoever backs away from this increasing of power is going to lose politically and that if we if we now back down then china will win and so the mechanism of its of its implications in the world are playing themselves out in a way that nobody can stop anymore because they have they have their boots in the reality and are making reality move in a certain direction and a good example of a good example that we see in uh stories is this idea of course of the genie in the bottle that is you know you you ask a genie for something your desire what's your desire and you understand that the genie is the pattern that has all the power to implement it in the world so you connect those two together this intermediary kind of angelic or patterned figure that is fallen that's why he's trapped in this lamp he's trapped in the world and now he says what is your desire so you tell him your desire and then what happens you get your desire but then because you engage with that pattern not through true knowledge not through true kind of ascending knowledge where you you encounter and embody and understand the pattern but because you do it with desire you don't understand the pattern you're invoking and therefore all the ramifications that you hadn't planned on start to play themselves out and now you have there's no you have no control over it so you you ask for something and then all the side effects of what you asked for start to appear that's of course the classic story of the genie and a good example of that is of course the automobile we we wanted the automobile people wanted the automobile because they could see that it would make them more powerful it would increase their speed would increase their capacity to travel long distances um but what that led to people didn't realize at the outset that it would lead to the reorganizing of our entire society to the reorganizing of the way that cities are planned the way that all communities function that we would create these these suburbs with just houses and when we create these shopping centers with just stores and then we would create these cultural centers where you go to see movies and you go to the theater and that these would all be disconnected and so be and because of the car you could not you could live in a world where you don't interact with your neighbors because you're constantly going to work 30 minutes there going to the store 30 minutes there visiting your family and your friends that live an hour away and it it it actually restructured all of our society and it restructured the very way in which our communities existed and actually led to the fact that communities ceased to exist it's not the only factor but it definitely led to the to the capacity for us to exist without without embodied community and that was not of course i mean i'm sure that ford that's not what he wanted that's that wasn't in the plans but these patterns they're intelligent they act upon the world and they have their own will you could say and once they're unleashed then you cannot stop them and some of these giants that you see in in scripture and that i've been telling you about civilizations and armies or bodies and these kind of big bodies that exist in the world that you know we've got one coming very quick quick on us and it is of course artificial intelligence we realize that artificial intelligence nobody controls it nobody totally can see inside that black box and it's so powerful and its ramifications are impossible to fully account for but everybody understands that if you don't if you don't run that race then you'll lose and so even though someone like elon musk was saying was warning everybody about artificial intelligence just a few years ago he realized that whoever doesn't participate in the body of this of this emerging god is going to lose and so nobody can stop it even if you try uh it's just going to happen and of course uh nuclear weapons which sorry i forgot to translate that one sentence from my uh my presentation nuclear weapons are of course the same because it's the same you create nuclear weapons the other person creates nuclear weapons and then you create more and more and it's very hard to come to a point where you totally de-escalate because whoever de-escalates and whoever doesn't de-escalate even if it's in secret is going to win and so it has a it has a will of its own that's kind of manifesting itself through an intelligent pattern um so that can also help you understand how the deals we make with these intelligences if we do it through desire for power then they will lead to destruction and that for itself is the position in which we're in right now for those that still hold on to a kind of luciferian vision of the world i think they should be able to see that to think that one more technical one more technical move let's say is going to bring about the solution is to misunderstand the very way in which this is happening and so there is of course in our in our stories in our narrative there is of course all of these things come together and so the relationship between aliens technology the obsession with the imaginary fantasy the the idea of fiction and fantasy all of that how it comes together violence sexuality hybrids cyborgs robots psychedelics this anti-human spell that we see this idea that humans need to be transcended and of course this weird opposition between chaos and domination that fills up all our fictional stories as well it's just one more representation of what it is that's kind of going on and uh there it's not surprising that you know some of the prominent orthodox thinkers in the 20th century have connected and other christian thinkers have connected the relationship between these fallen angels and this image that we have of the graves and of these aliens encounters how this related to to uh technology how it's related also to psychedelics if you look into the relationship between the development of apple computers and psychedelics you'll see that all of this is kind of uh coming together remember that the fallen angels also taught people how to make these drugs and to make these concoctions you could say and that there's a relationship between using these concoctions to go into the spiritual world without truly ascending in moral virtue and in transformation but it's like a shortcut right to increase your power is also all related to this as well and of course this leads to the end of a world now there's a when it talks about the end of the world in the book of enoch it's an interesting image and so of course it talks about you know the end of a world it talks about the earth being emerged all things are going to perish that the judgment will come upon us all but it will come upon even the righteous but to them he shall give peace shall preserve the elect and towards them exercise clemency then shall all belong to god be happy and blessed and the splendor of the godhead shall illuminate them so this sense in which although this is all happening this world is is collapsing and falling apart that through this there's a mysterious transformation operating itself and that it is ultimately leading to god filling all in all and that this knowledge even though it was taken let's say in ill will in passion and it leads to destruction god can ultimately transform that in true illumination and true filling up uh of his presence in reality i don't know how that works i don't know how it happens but it's definitely described in the book of revelation as the heavenly jerusalem which descends onto heaven and becomes a perfect balance between the guardian and the city between that moment of innocence in the garden and now this falling into knowledge to passion into ultimately a true knowledge in the end where things are integrated together so the story does have a happy ending but in the meantime understanding the book of enoch can help us on can help us see how the patterns that are described in genesis are one of the ways and one of the keys to helping us understand how the different manifestations of our world are connected together how the different ways things are breaking down are not separate from each other but the relationship between desire and power and the breakdown the fragmentation the the relationship between hybrids and technology all of this is directly described in is described in genesis and then let's say uh built upon in the book of enoch and it help us it can help us understand our situation now and it can also help us understand let's say the the way out which is to move it's not it's important to understand once again that it's not that these technologies are necessarily bad in themselves but because they come about through desire that's what leads to the destruction so it all it but it does lead to the possibility this whole imagery and the imagery in the book of revelation to understanding how if things are in their proper place if things are in their proper function that they can lead to something better and so hopefully we can be a part of that at least on a small scale at least around us to the people that surround us so i hope this has been helpful it was a long kind of trek through the book of enoch and uh how it's related to to us today i hope it was helpful to help you understand what's going on and why this book is important to understand again today so thanks for your attention everybody and uh we'll talk to you soon as you know the symbolic world is not just a bunch of videos on youtube we are also a podcast which you can find on your uh usual podcast platform but we also have a website with a blog and several very interesting articles by very intelligent people that have been thinking about symbolism on all kinds of subjects we also have a clips channel a facebook group you know there's a whole lot of ways that you can get more involved in the exploration and the discussion of symbolism don't forget that my brother matsuya wrote a book called the language of creation which is a very powerful synthesis of a lot of the ideas that explore and so please go ahead and explore this world
