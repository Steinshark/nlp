if there's one thing that nearly every documentary has in common it's interviews interviews often make up the narrative backbone of a story and i think that hearing how things happened right from the mouths of the people involved in those stories is usually a more effective technique than voiceover from the filmmaker who's usually an outsider pretty much all documentaries are built around interviews of one kind or another and learning how to do them well will pay off big time in the long run but what is a good interview and what can you do to get the most out of your characters in this video i'm gonna break down five things you can do to improve your interviewing style so you can put them into practice on your next shoot let's get into it [Music] hey guys welcome back and if you're new here my name is luke forsyth documentary cinematographer and filmmaker and on this channel i teach the skills i've learned over 10 years working as a documentary filmmaker and photographer interviewing is hard i'm not going to pretend it's not if you've watched a lot of my videos already you might already know that before i got into documentary production i was a professional photojournalist based in cambodia and even though my main job was to take photos photojournalists are well journalists and so i started learning the basics of how to ask strangers good questions way before i had to do my first sit-down interviews for tv and while the way i interview people might have changed a bit over the years there are some fundamental things you can do that won't change whether you're alone with someone in a coffee shop or you've got five cameras and a whole crew sitting behind you the first thing you can do starts before you ever meet the person you're interviewing have you ever had someone ask you for basic information that they could easily find themselves like one of those questions they're just asking because they're too lazy to google it showing up to an interview and asking dumb questions that anyone who's done even a little bit of research should have known it's kind of the same thing for the people in front of the camera once i was asked to interview a politician in mexico and i didn't do any research at all i think i was not feeling well or maybe i was just being lazy i can't remember but i showed up and set everything up and when he came in with all his bodyguards one of the first questions i asked him is where are you from there was this awkward pause in the room until finally he told me the name of the city and that he was the mayor i mean that's an outrageously dumb question to make and i'm sure someone must have told me in advance that who i was talking to this is an easy example of how you can get yourself into a bad position without doing research on the person you're interviewing first no matter what i did for the rest of the interview i could tell that i'd lost his respect and that he was just rushing through his answers so he could get out of there and honestly i don't blame him i would have been annoyed too in his position i'm sure none of you guys would do something that stupid but the point i'm trying to make here is that the more you can learn about your character before you interview them the better off you'll be you'll ask better questions make them feel more important which will then make them feel more comfortable and you can avoid asking things that won't lead anywhere i used to do interviews at the start of a shoot to try and get them out of the way but a lot of the time now i'll wait until the end of a shoot so i can make sure i know as much as possible about them before we get into the deep questions at the very least give the person a google before you show up but two more if possible it will make a big difference trust me the next thing i suggest is also something to take care of before you get to your location just like writing a script is important when planning a documentary knowing what you need to get out of your character in an interview ahead of time is crucial in my opinion an interview is the backbone of your story and so if you're trying to tell a specific story you need questions that speak to that story directly you have to write the questions out in advance to make sure you get what you need because if you just go in there blind you'll get to the edit and realize that you forgot a few things that you really needed and the story doesn't make any sense now i like to start a new document on my phone as soon as i know an interview is coming up even if it's weeks or even months away then i can keep adding new questions to it as i learn more and more about the story and start to understand what i'm gonna need my characters to touch on you can always skip over questions on the day so just get them all out because you never know what might be worth asking you might think this step is overkill and that you're going to have no problem coming up with questions but in my experience things tend to get hectic once you start rolling you might remember all the big stuff but if you miss important little details and then let that person go you might never get them back in front of the camera on top of that nothing takes away a character's confidence in you as an interviewer than long periods of silence like uh and um while you think of what to ask next having a long list of things to ask gives you something to fall back on during those blank moments and it will keep things moving but even though pre-writing your questions is super important there are times when that huge list in your lap can be a bad thing having all your questions ahead of time will help keep you on track but there's also the danger that you stick so rigidly to what's on there that you close yourself off to new ideas that come up in the middle of the interview let me give you an example a few years ago i was a dp on a shoot and the director got tunnel vision and was like totally focused on her pre-written questions we were interviewing a prisoner in a mexico city jail and we asked a question about what he'd done he told us but at the end of his answer he said something about how disappointed he was to be just like his dad the director was flustered from being inside the jail all day and it had been a long shoot so it is totally understandable that she was relying on the pre-written questions but to me it seemed like an invitation to ask him about his father as a dp though you shouldn't jump in on the middle of someone's interview unless there's a very good reason so i just kept quiet it wasn't until later that we found out the guy's dad had been in jail for the exact same crime which was a super interesting plot point we got a quick sound bite with the onboard mic but it would have been so much better to have asked about it in the sit-down interview because i'm guessing it could have gotten really emotional you might think that you'd never miss something important like that but doc shoots are long and tiring and trust me people make mistakes so you really want to have those questions written in advance but at the same time you still have to listen to the answers a lot of the times when you're interviewing there's this tendency to start thinking about your next question while the person's speaking you're trying to figure out exactly how you're going to say something or what kind of answer you need for the edit and suddenly you realize you were lost in thought and didn't hear anything they just said as much as possible you need to fight this so you can respond to new and interesting side topics as they pop up if you stick rigidly to your questions you could easily miss out on something that might totally change the direction of your story so plan be ready but be flexible if your subject veers off topic listen to them and see if it's going anywhere if not steer them back to your questions but you might just find something interesting by giving them a little extra room while we're still on the dangers of that question page there's something else you need to keep in mind you might be doing an interview because you need some sound bites for your documentary film but the subject you're interviewing is a real person and sitting in front of a camera is uncomfortable if you've ever sat on this side of the camera before you'll know how impersonal and awkward it can be and how it can kind of tend to frazzle all your thoughts to the point where you're not even sure what you're saying anymore as an interviewer you need to do anything you can to get people to relax and my fourth tip is to create an environment where it feels more like you're having a conversation with a person rather than a camera so how do you do that well with eye contact and visual cues just like when you're having a conversation with a friend that you find really interesting that means looking at them in the eyes and nodding a lot holding eye contact will help them focus on you rather than the camera and it also conveys a sense of attention if you're just staring down at your questions while they're talking they'll think you don't care what they're saying glance down at them to keep you on track but your main focus should be right here on their eyes nodding a lot is also a good idea and reinforces that not only are you paying attention but you're also interested in what they're saying this is going to encourage them to keep talking and not feel self-conscious which will ruin your chances of getting an open and honest answer in a real conversation you'd probably make little noises to show that you're listening like but to protect your audio you have to keep as quiet as possible so let nodding do the heavy lifting and don't be afraid to lay it on thick the person in front of the camera will appreciate it that's a good segue into the last tip like i was just saying being interviewed sucks and his super awkward experience unless you have a ton of experience which most normal people don't if your subject is tense and anxious you're not going to get the best out of them a person who's normally really well spoken could come off as shy or the smartest person in the field could seem like an amateur as they stumble over their words chances are they might have never done this before and new things make even super smart people nervous so what can you do explain to them what's about to happen take two minutes before the cameras roll to run over basic information like your general line of questioning what kind of answers you're looking for how long they should expect to be there and this might seem really obvious to you but you're a filmmaker and they're not if you're going to need them for two hours tell them that in advance they don't start fidgeting after 20 minutes waiting to go to the bathroom just a quick rundown before pressing record might make a big difference in someone's comfort level i also make a point of telling them not to worry about messing up because it's digital and we can always cut it out because sometimes people get really rattled when they make a mistake the point here is to reassure them as much as possible because for the vast majority of people being interviewed it's not fun i mean i was actually a local news stand-up reporter in high school for a year plus i make tv for a living and i have a youtube channel and even i really don't like it so for a doctor or a scientist or a construction worker it's horrible if i went to the dentist and they just pushed me down in the chair and came at me with the drills without telling me what we were going to do i would flip out putting someone in front of a bunch of lights and cameras and then just hitting record as soon as they get in the seat is kind of the same thing i don't know is that a weird analogy who knows i think you get the point just tell them what's going on and there we go there's my five tips for how to get better at interviewing if you go into doc filmmaking you're gonna do a ton of interviews over the course of your career so the better you can get at it the better your stories are gonna be i hope that video helped you out and if it did maybe think about hitting that subscribe button and if you liked that one maybe check out this other video
