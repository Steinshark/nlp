today i'm gonna be reacting to videos i couldn't upload to this channel like one time we rammed a car going 100 miles per hour into a wall another video that never got uploaded was a video where we built a city out of bouncy castles it was insane we also tried to lay the world's longest domino chain we visited the seven wonders of the world and much more me and the boys are gonna react to them and just you know tell you what went wrong which video do you want to react to first chandler 100 mile an hour car versus wall that's a good one there's no story in this at all we just duct taped a bowling ball into a car and then just slammed into trying wait wait chris you want to see your strike in slow-mo i do why you're so happy and in case you're wondering yes this was filmed on a closed course with professional supervision obviously don't try this at home this was fun what look how far it goes i don't even remember filming them oh yeah because we could edit the green screen we thought it'd be funny to hit a green screen oh wow we hit a shark oh no we're getting eaten by a shark oh no we get more who puts that there oh wait i already know chris is gonna freak out chris loves this one so chris what happened here you got a bread on this card you got a bread on this car they hit boom sandwich look at that it actually worked kind of that counts sort of worked instead of having your parents make you sandwiches just grab two cars and ram them together and that's how you can make it use your parents cars and also take their credit card now after all that chaos it finally came to the time when we rammed this car 100 miles an hour into a wall you threw a brick on the gas pedal and there she goes no one's in the car she's going she's climbing and there you go the build-up of the entire video to a blurry camera shot and right when i saw that camera shot that's when i went we're just gonna delete that and that's 100 mile an hour car versus wall but not all videos get scrapped because they're story lines some videos they just fall apart literally here's security camera footage of our warehouse that right there is a giant pit of glue and we were gonna do last leave glue wins a bunch of money but the glue pick couldn't hold it and it literally just bust open which is kind of ironic because you would think thousands of pounds of glue would stick together that literally took weeks to clean up it wasn't fun the next video that didn't get uploaded is visiting the seven wonders of the world what i did is i surprised all my friends with vacations to a random wonder of the world you went to the pyramids of egypt yeah and you went to stonehenge yeah that was terrible garrett went to machu picchu and we're here why i don't know jamie marcus went to the grand canyon and so on oh wow whoa we gotta get a comparison yeah this is the guy your girlfriend tells you not to worry about this is you yeah yeah so let's start off with you chandler this is you yes at the great pyramid we are at the great pyramids this is our tour guide with the umbrella hat how were the pyramids they were big yeah here's your on the floor this guy took me on a hit right here oh my gosh yeah we were doing wheelies it was so fun here's ty at niagara falls i think he was trying to act like a news reporter it's been a while since i looked at this footage all right where's chris if you're wondering where chris is it's because he went to stonehenge and there's nothing to do there look there's rocks behind us literally just rocks and it's a wonder of the world and it's a wonder i wonder why it's a woman that's why it's a wonder the world wonder i went to was the roman coliseum but when i was flying there i accidentally left my camera on the plane and i could not find a camera store in freaking italy i'm gonna hit you guys with the sigh this video cost around 90 000 between all the plane tickets the hotels the food all that stuff 90 grand and because i left my camera on a plane and i called the airlines they couldn't find it i didn't have my footage and we couldn't upload it and the next video we scrapped is dominoes we tried to film this domino video four times and all four times it didn't work let me run you through it the first time we filmed this video i got all the boys in a room and i told them whoever made the coolest domino contraption won money but the problem is they all suck at laying dominoes and it wasn't that cool so i gave them three days to build stuff and all they could build was the eyes of a creeper whatever that was seven thousand dominoes that took a long time yeah you guys had three days what is this so then the next week we tried to lay the world's longest domino chain this is us laying dominoes and we were dead set on trying to lay the longest domino chain ever the wind kept knocking it down so we ended up laying them on their sides it sounds good on paper breaking the world's longest domino chain but what we quickly realized is it's boring as crap to watch people lay dominoes for 15 minutes all these scrap videos are from months ago obviously none of these are recent what is this video i don't know here's a shot of the line after a very long day this is all the dominoes look at that that's a big boy we were dedicated and chandler did keep knocking it over but you know we kept going every time and by chandler i mean me huh i wonder why this video didn't get uploaded we're getting bored watching it yeah i know for some reason we thought we'd be able to lay a domino chain on the side of a road and break the world record that way but no once we realized that we just decided to knock them all over because why not and uh yeah this is the the chain that didn't work now it doesn't this is the chain this is not as hype as i thought it was gonna be this is not a slope this is so boring i mean you can clearly see why we scrapped this video the domino chain might have seemed a little lame but we had a cool surprise at the end we literally laid all this domino artwork at the end as like a finale of the video look at that youtube button that isn't good forever that's very satisfying that's really satisfying oh none of what we laid work we have to constantly go in and knock more dominoes over it was a disaster okay we're not good at laying dominoes you know how much those dominoes cost how much i think like 70 grand good thing i didn't pay for it social distancing the next video i scrapped is a video where i wanted to give a couple dogs the best month of their life what i did was i got a barn and i renovated it to look like a doggy wonderland i even built a giant fence out back i got the dogs unlimited food unlimited toys literally anything they could ever want but the problem is in america when you're housing a bunch of dogs there's a ton of laws and apparently you just can't do it so yeah i spent like 60 70 000 on this barn and all this other stuff and then um when it came to filming i realized oh i'm not allowed to do this i'm not allowed to just get a bunch of dogs and treat him like king apparently you have to have licenses and stuff to house a bunch of dogs so we had to get it up next is a video where we tried to break a bunch of world records the gist of it was me and the boys were gonna try to break like 100 world records and shocker it's a lot harder than we thought so these are some of the ones we did and we even called on cam newton he's a nfl quarterback to help us break some football world records with 31 yards you are officially amazing thank you dad that was the longest throw through a tire 31 yards yeah no like road through a tire that's amazing gotta three on you on youtube chandler broke the world record for the longest blindfolded catch believe it or not this is actually a legit world record like guinness was there and that is the longest blindfolded catch ever another guinness world record title you all are still officially amazing thank you hey you and cam newton broke a world record yes we did and i want to say thank you to cam for giving me this record didn't you break another one with them oh yes this one right here was held by a lot of nfl players the most one-handed catches in a minute was 30. and then you and cam did 32. 51. wow oh with 51 catches i would not have been able to do it put my quarterback man and the final world record we try to beat is the highest football catch ever i got in a helicopter 600 feet in the air and i was dropping footballs as you see here it was hitting the stadium and we kept missing and we actually ended up running out of time so we didn't get that world record but that one would have been sick yeah and the next one we scrapped was i built a city out of bouncy castles for whatever reason we thought it'd be a good idea to rent dozens of bouncy castles and then bring all these people in and have a city this drone shot you're looking at right now we literally built this city out of bouncy castles okay so here's how the video started we pull up to the city right here out of bounty castle everything here is bouncing related and our citizens are very bounce happy brother bobby boulevard that's a call back right there look at this tree with the tags this is the most embarrassing video we've ever filmed in our life but who put that there the cringe hasn't even started yet area each one is complete with a p.o box and all of our lawnmowers blow bubbles all of our lawnmowers blow bubbles this guy was apparently the town fruit dealer and he was charging us a hundred dollars for plastic 100 quality so how much is that a hundred dollars that's how you know it's right how is it dude the middle of that thing hurt it was solid i thought that was dude i got like five concussions in this video oh that's where i get great i also told him the technique taylor the entire video is going to people and saying tackle chris he was the good part for some reason we had a three-way banana duel it was a standoff yes we were like what's going on this is just a fraction of the city we built it's a fraction of the cringe yes better way to phrase it all right now bounce city had a bounce obstacle course i did great look at this look look at this kill look at marcus and at this part chris had a pair of scissors which this is a city made out of inflatable bouncy castles right you pop it they're done for it so then he started popping things and then so then we started running away and everyone chased us because we had scissors don't worry i threw the scissors before i started running we got chase out of the town because we had a pair of scissors and that's against the rules and that's i built the city out of bouncy castles that was a an emotional roller coaster to say the least i was hoping that would never see the light of day but it just did you're welcome this is my corner of pain and the final video i'm going to show you guys today is this dinosaur video basically me and the boys rated a mall with dinosaurs and you guys liked it so we did it again with even more dinosaurs and you guys like that so my logic was let's just do it again with even more dinosaurs so we bought 1 000 dinosaur costumes and got hundreds of people to gather on a day again this was months ago before all this stuff currently going on and we gave them all dinosaur costumes and began to raid places the reason this didn't work out is i ended up getting sick and i had to leave halfway through i hate when i get sick sick jimmy not good jimmy but regardless of that the video is still really freaking funny wow look at all these dinosaurs i still can't believe we had all these people come out shout out to everyone who uh put on the dinosaur costume i love you guys it was also very hot that day and of course after playing around in the field the first place we had to raid was a gym but not just any gym a trampoline all those dinosaurs oh wipeouts the idea for this video was if we just had hundreds of people in dinosaur costumes we could just go into stores and it'd be hilarious the gym was cool but my favorite part is when we raided the movie theater so here you go we took hundreds of people in dinosaur costume to a movie theater we bought every ticket to every seat in this room so we could get this shot wasn't that pretty expensive it was and here it is that's so funny wait do we forget to buy two tickets are they on a date in there then people are having a date in the middle of our what this is a asteroid hitting the earth and obviously this is going to anger the dinos that would make me angry it's giving them flashbacks and they all went crazy we thought this would be so funny out of anger we then raided them all because we were forced to watch the earth be destroyed again everybody was loving it though at the mall it made everybody's day at least yeah except for probably the mall owner was like what in tarnation that's what he said actually i heard it when i felt better i wanted to redo it and i was like so how many costumes do we have and when they were like oh they're all gone everyone just took them home and i was like boy and you get the gist of this video we scrapped tons of videos in the past if you add them all up these videos that i never uploaded probably cost over 400 000 film but i care about you guys and i don't want to upload garbage and if the video isn't good i don't upload it and money aside these videos actually took forever to make like this bouncy castle video we spent weeks on the seven wonders of the world we spent over six days flying the domino's video we tried to film four times the 100 mile an hour car video we spent almost a week prepping for in a few days filming like this is like a month's worth of work too that just never saw the light of day like when i say i only want to upload good videos like i genuinely mean it i don't care if we spend a month on a video if we spent over a hundred thousand dollars like if it's not entertaining and i don't think you guys will like it i will put it in this png of a dumpster i will make ice age baby eat it i don't know why these are on my wall so do me a favor and subscribe because i promise whatever's in your sub box will be at least kinda sorta good love you guys see you later you
