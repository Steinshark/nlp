the world was absolutely Blown Away pun intended when four systems came out of stealth after four years of building a solid-state cooling system that sucks a lot of air look at this thing and here we are six months later with everything basically fully uncovered they've got multiple solid-state cooled PCS torn down air jet minis for us to peek inside and they're even teasing a more powerful version with double the cooling capacity and here's double the segue to our sponsor segue to our sponsor xsplit looking to take your video streaming to the next level xsplit is a software company that provides simple yet effective broadcasting and video production tools check them out at the link below and use code Linus for a very nice 69 off your first purchase or subscription at risk of sounding offensive it doesn't really look like much they've got a flat copper bottom that sits on your CPU or SOC any heat generating component on the top you've got these kind of paper filters over the intake flexible PCB that goes into their drive system and then at the back there's a tapered section that leads to a skinny little exhaust and it's there that the unimpressed completely disappear I mean this thing hauls but they are blowing air at over 200 kilometers an hour through those filters and Blasting it onto the copper plate but here's the thing moving air is just a means to an end it's only part of the battle we don't really want to move air what we want to do is remove heat let's take it apart to see if we can get a better understanding of just what's going on here I cannot believe they're letting us do this here's the completed cooling module which I've shown you already and here it is completely torn down into its constituent components it starts with yeah this really is just a sticker four little paper filter windows in it okay and then we can get into what I would call the cooling engine it uses piezoelectrics and we did a full video about this recently but basically a piezoelectric material vibrates when you apply an alternating current to it so what you're looking at in the top is these intake slits that pull air through those filters okay then out the bottom they've got all these little jets that blow down onto here's the last component this kind of crappy flat copper spreader I mean okay I get it you want to keep this thing thin it's just 2.8 millimeters and that's critical for getting the design in thin and light devices like like laptops but every cooling plate that I've ever seen that doesn't totally suck has got fins or other structures to help increase the surface area what is going on here to find out we need to go back to the cooling engine or the cooling chip as they call it on the underside there are 80 small openings called impingement Jets they were only willing to let us open up an older prototype that has twice as many but you should still be able to get the idea here and these jets are a huge part of the Special Sauce that makes this cooling solution so unique we've shown many times in the past but there are diminishing returns as you blow air faster and faster over a heatsink this is because of something called The Boundary layer check out this illustration from Wikipedia see no matter how fast your air is moving sort of near a heatsink fin the speed of it is always going to approach zero as it reaches the actual Fin and this is due to friction what happens then is this creates a blanket of insulating air that prevents heat from being removed from the fin efficiently well what Roar has done is they've used these Jets of super high velocity high pressure air to completely obliterate the boundary layer this increases effective heat dissipation by about five times for the same airflow and functionally saturates the air with heat bringing it up to nearly the same temperature as the copper heat spreader now an airjet mini is good for about five watts of cooling at room temperature assuming the die is at about 85 degrees so naturally I asked them well can you just take a bunch of these throw them on a vapor chamber and and of course they've already done that this Samsung thinning light right here has been modified with three airjet minis for a total of 15 watts of active cooling on top of the passive dissipation through the chassis now they could have put a fourth one on here but this machine wasn't designed in collaboration with thror so they had to improvise a little bit and as you can see there's some PCB there that wouldn't very much like to be chopped off this is such a good demo here because they've got their four modified laptop here running right next to an unmodified one showing some key benefits so first up check this out using our thermal camera we can actually see that if we look at the exhaust temperature behind the system our floor is at about 41 degrees while the regular cooler is at about 35. this can be partially explained by the heat saturation of the air like I talked about before but part of it is also that our Ferrar laptop is running about 10 degrees hotter wait but that's a good thing let me explain in many laptops the performance limitation is actually not the temperature of the CPU or the soc rather it's because of the external temperature of the device anything above about 45 degrees Celsius will eventually burn the user so thin and light laptops will already throttle performance if the hot spot on the bottom exceeds this level that is where the air Jet's second big party trick comes in aside from not needing a fan it is extremely high static pressure for our systems claims that an airjet mini manages about 10 times the static pressure of a MacBook Pro cooler over 1700 pascals that allows it to suck air through restrictive openings much more effectively than a conventional fan which improves cooling not just of the CPU that it's installed on top of but of the entire system so because the skin temperatures of our two laptops are so different the floor system CPU is actually operating at 33 percent higher power that is going to have a dramatic impact on performance that's why the chip is running hotter another advantage of the high static pressure is dust resistance typically a laptop can't be both actively cooled and dust proof unless you create a separate compartment for the fan and heatsink kind of like what they do in some rugged machines that is not a great solution for a thin and Light but with the air jet there's the dust filter that's on the airjet module itself and you can also use that pressure that that suction ability to install dust filters on the intake of the device without trashing your airflow so you could have it pull air through a filter here put air through another filter here and blow it out the back cooling the entire device and the best part they built in a reverse like blast out cleaning solution for the filters so they should last five years and Beyond without getting gummed up even though they're just basic paper dust filters this dust resistance is what made the airjet perfect for their first commercial product the Zotac z-box Pico with airjet this Mini PC is intended to be used on Factory floors where dust and debris could easily clog up a normal fan cooled device now in the past Zotac got around this by just passively cooling the CPUs in these devices but that limited them to a 5 watt Celeron Processor with this dual airjet mini solution though they can now use a 15 watt core I3 which takes them from two cores to eight that is a massive performance uplift and we can see the difference right behind me where they've got one of these systems running passively this is with the core I3 showing how it's thermal throttling to hell and then they've got the four systems cooled model where you can see the performance is a lot better and this is still early stages they're expecting to be able to get CPU power up a fair bit by improving the efficiency of the rest of the device that is all really impressive and changes my question from why did you guys need to be in stealth for four years too how did you do this at all as we saw in our piezoelectric fan video ensuring that you hit the resonant frequency can have a huge impact on performance and the thermal expansion of the vibrating membranes is enough to knock it out of whack meaning that they have to constantly change the input frequency between 23 000 to 24 000 Hertz to ensure that it's always operating at Peak efficiency that brings the full power consumption of each chip to just one watt at Full Tilt that's not bad for five watts of cooling each for context that would allow you to handle a 15 watt system with two air Jets and would cost you only about two watts of power for heat dissipation that's almost identical to a small fan like the one on the steam deck which is two and a half watts and takes up more space but hold on a second here Linus when you guys showed off that expensive piezoelectric fan a while back it had low power consumption sure and it was dust proof but it had none of these other benefits where was the high pressure okay I'm getting there you've heard me a couple of times refer to the air jet as a chip well I asked them what makes it a chip like does it have some onboard processing or something the answer is no but that doesn't make them big Liars achieving the kind of one-way valve operation that gives this cooler such high static pressure it takes a lot more than just a vibrating tongue depressor like we saw last time so like a chip the air jet is precisely manufactured using photolithography the same process as you would use to build a CPU or a GPU you coat the cooling engine layer by layer with photo resist then expose it to light and etching chemicals and remove the unneeded material this is inherently a two-dimensional process so the air jet gets built up one layer at a time until we have our final little air blaster now the manufacturing process is a big part of the reason that the airjet is only going to be found in premium devices at least for the time being where you can justify that additional cost with the additional performance that it can unlock because see the thing is while photolithography is a well understood and fairly mature manufacturing process especially at a relatively macro scale like this Ferrar is working with entirely new non-silicate materials that required extensive r d and brand new Machinery to manufacture at any sort of scale and high cost isn't the only bad news while their demo here does a really good job of showing how the fur system outputs less overall sound than the conventional fan I found that the quality of the noise that is that it's at a bit of a higher pitch made it significantly more noticeable the good news is that there are clear paths to resolving at least some of these problems in the future while the airjet mini outputs laminar airflow in order to make it quieter this laptop wasn't designed with the airjet mini in mind and it's blasting that air at the bottom of this hinge and the bottom of the screen increasing turbulence and increasing noise they can actually adjust the nozzle in a device that's built for their cooler to help alleviate this issue and there's more the road map these guys are showing looks extremely promising when they went out of Stealth at CES they showed what the airjet mini but there's more even at their current manufacturing node so to speak they can already build higher performance solutions the airjet pro is twice the size and manages to remove twice the heat about 10 watts at only 1.7 times the power consumption so devices like laptops could easily have a bank of like four of these sitting along the back cooling up to a 45 watt chip as long as you've got a vapor chamber to spread the Heat and oh the best part you wouldn't even like need a bottom intake anymore so you can put your laptop down on your bed and it's not going to overheat because you could just draw air in from anywhere so cool and it can be used on just about anything aside from computers they're showing off LED light fixtures at like one tenth the overall volume they've got uh oh check this out actively cooled ssds that are operating it out okay that one's really hot the the knot for a cooled one uh smart like iot devices like want to overclock your ring doorbell with an airjet mini they figured you could do about eight watts compared to the 3.3 Watts that is allowed with the passive stock configuration I mean what's next I'd love to see this thing modded into an Rog Ally or a steam deck too many should do the trick right Alex oh yeah is that a project you guys want to see oh what about in a phone I mean there's gaming phones with fans and water cooling in them already why not this black shark RG phone team you guys up and what's really wild is this is all just with the current gen their Material Science folks do see a path to doubling their performance per unit area every couple of years for the next little while we could see thin and light gaming PCs with 70 class Nvidia Graphics in just a few short years and I'm not talking the cooling limited ones that we see today I'm talking full performance the main levers that they're going to be using to do this are higher amplitude vibrations and higher frequency vibrations which makes sense and so that combined with if they can bring costs down I mean they wouldn't go as far to say it see they're not going to say it right now but when I asked are you guys trying to make fans just obsolete caught one of their technical guys nodding in the background huh yeah it's not impossible that they could even get the cost competitive you see the thing is a motorhub is always going to have a fixed cost because of like magnets and stuff but if they're able to scale in a Moore's Law kind of way well let me put it this way the hard drive industry thought it would always be safe from low capacity ssds and they cost so much and where are they at now fur says that their process is similar to TV panel manufacturing where the larger they can get the mother glass the bigger the panels they can build at lower costs well that sounds pretty good given TVs have been one of the only thing that's been inflation proof lately so right now yeah the costs are high but that's because they're operating at a very small manufacturing scale because it's so new that could all change just like the Segway changed from what we wrote to our sponsor Sweetwater when we
