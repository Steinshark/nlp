ladies and gentlemen I am currently on vacation and what better way to spend summer vacation than not going out and looking at any history not eating some tasty food not interacting with locals but sitting back in your hotel room and recording chess content of course I did some of the other stuff as well but it's hot so we're back here we're drinking some nice giant European water and um I'm gonna record a video for you today that's quite special it's turning into a little bit of a series a couple of weeks ago I recorded a video called This is the lowest chess ELO where I spent 24 hours in the 100 ELO rating range on chas.com I played bullet I played Blitz I also asked everybody if they watch Gotham chess and not a single person responded to me well today I'm not going to play 100 ELO chess because I already did that and I don't want to make the same content six like 65 times or however many guess the ELO episodes I have but today I'm going to be 500 ELO so we're gonna see how good are people on chess.com at 500 ELO that's it that's the whole thing and one more thing that we're going to do uh is we're going to ask people if they watch uh Gotham content because we just I don't even know what happened last time it was ridiculous um I feel like a good way to start is just the good old fashioned little Blitz game um internet here little bit all right a little bit Shady I've got a 451 Blitz player and I'm gonna start with E4 the 450 ELO player aborted the game okay we're off to a good start I'm gonna offer a rematch maybe it was an accidental abort uh you know maybe he just didn't have the patience to wait eight seconds for my first move or or maybe he saw my username and uh rescue Jerry let's go Pawn to E4 let's see how 500s play Blitz now the goal here for me is not to Smurf everybody knows at chess.com that I am doing this if I do accidentally defeat anybody they will get their ELO back I'm gonna Auto board here so let's just play principle chess we attacked the pawn in the center of the board with Knight to F3 um in a few moves I'm going to ask my opponent if they watch Gotham they play Knight to C6 and I'm gonna go for the four nights obviously I can play Bishop C4 so here we have a very standard Four Knights I think now's a good time to ask the question uh hi do you watch Gotham chess all right last time we went oh for five or o for six let's see how chatty these folks are Let's Play Bishop B5 this is called the Four Knights it's not really any sort of opening um and my opponent said perhaps well we already got a response so it seems like the 500s are real people when I was playing 100 elos on chess.com not a single one of them was responding to me which just makes me think they're all chat GPT programmed individuals um we're gonna castle and um we we are down 20 seconds right now it seems like we're just getting copied in general copying is not like the worst strategy in the world but it's not a very good one at some point black is gonna have to probably do something but not yet I don't really know how to respond to perhaps so I think I'm just gonna ghost my opponent in the middle of the game this is a great move uh a central strike it's well supported I think at the 500 level a lot of people they they suffer from this they kind of go can I take yes and then I just will they don't really evaluate let me do this as well we're now taking twice this was a well thought out decision by my opponent um and now I think what I'm going to do is play the move Bishop takes Knight because I can right because the queen is hitting the bishop it would have been a little bit better for me to probably bring the bishop back or so this trade is is not the worst thing in the world but my opponent should not have taken with the queen they should have taken with the pawn because now the queen no longer defends this pawn and just for instructional reasons I will show that um I think my opponent is now going to move the queen somewhere it can attack my knight and my goal is going to be to defend my knight and see if that see if they see this move that's uh that's what we're going for oh oh no the board is a big place the board is a big place ah I'm not gonna take though cause I'm nice instead I'm gonna go here to attack the queen of course their Bishop if they see this but they don't see this okay okay and yeah they actually do move their Queen um what I have here is a tactic which is a discovered attack I can play Knight F6 check actually and Knight H6 check um and uh my queen would be attacking this queen but not a chance in a million years that a uh that a 500 sees that so let's play Queen F3 of course this has two Targets on it my opponent has not has not seen that let's play H3 I think my opponent is trying to set up some sort of a Checkmate here it's a very decent idea it's a little bit of Hope Chest because of course I can take with the queen if Pawn takes then I do in fact get mated I don't really want to like throw that intensely on purpose so if anything I will lose this game on time okay they go for an end game so far so good I mean this 500 has played quite well with the exception of hanging the queen in one move actually in hanging the other queen as well with Knight F6 but that one was very difficult that's why you always have to look for checks this is not a good end game move uh this person needs my endgame as Master Class you should take the the open file here if possible but you know we're 500 so they push upon two squares I push upon this is typical 500 stuff now we're gonna go A5 A4 this is oh well I will not give you my Rook you have to activate the great move oh my goodness fantastic move all right let's see if they realize Bishop takes and then they take my Pawn that's a nice little combo there nice look at that well done all right the only thing that I have left going for me is background Checkmate make a left don't just double your Rooks make sure your King has breathing space I I have nothing else to say all right that's excellent stuff I'm offering a Trader Brooks you should great move now it's time to double up you you got to bring a Little Help The Rook can't do the damage on its own and this should be easy oh my goodness this person is playing every move I'm suggesting I'm just gonna play out a few more moves and then lose on time this was a very very decent 500 level player um again minus the queen hang but that's you know it's not a real 500 ELO game unless you blunder your queen in one move let's see if I can get myself checkmated with five seconds on the clock I'm gonna try to you know is there a mate that's not me don't play oh no whoa with point one I take the Rook uh uh yeah and listen in blood's chest time is part of the game you cannot be mad that you got flagged or you lost on time um because you are the one that clicked the three minute game you know what I mean all right let's do a little quick little game review um of this 500 euro game that was a that was that dude that that dude or do that they were they were very strong I mean this person's game analysis after was ah okay well we're we both got an estimated ELO 500 ish all right well I thought that they played pretty well I mean they played very normal they played four nights um they also said they watched me which is good night takes and then here of course this is disaster uh you have to be careful with the long range pieces in general just returning to the square where you were is completely fine but they had the right right idea I really like that my opponent's plan here was to rotate and attack over here it was a good idea it was bad execution because the night was just hanging so and then here I missed uh I missed the big chance which is Knight to F6 check discovered attack on the queen but okay I mean that was uh that was a very good start um let's do a little bullet intermission let's see how 500 elos play bullet I mean I'm assuming this is going to be absolutely horrible but I'm ready to be surprised um if I can even find a bullet game Let me refresh the page sometimes that helps if I can't find a bullet game then I'm just gonna play rapid because that's that's the that's the creme de La Creme right there I guess there's not a lot of 500s playing bullet oh here we go delphini 369 A4 okay well I'll go on the other side then eight what is this now we're just playing normal e4d okay just why why did they start A4 I thought there was like some master plan ah okay are they trying to sneak into B5 is this the idea this is uh there is no idea I mean there is no idea for me either but um that's not a good move that's just the one mover is there any skill involved whatsoever in playing Bullet at the 500 ELO I really don't think so C5 I mean I'm just I'm making random moves are they gonna find Knight C7 that was the whole idea right that's why you put the Knight there and the bishop okay what if I attack you will you find this please okay very good you find this that's why you moved it what what why but but the Rook you take the Rook no no I could take this now but but I don't want to okay Bishop takes Bishop you gotta how are you how are you just leaving this here what are you what no  is he gonna see his own Rook he saw it Oh my God I'm gonna take the bishop this is crazy I'm winning on time I don't want to win the game okay I don't want to win the game I don't want to take anybody Zelo um this Knight is just standing here what is going on he just forgot he forgot his Knight is there I'm attacking Israel there's no way in a million years he's gonna see this oh my goodness this is a buzzer beater of a game ten I go back he has 12 11. turn oh my goodness is he ever I think he just he's he's totally forgotten I'm just gonna move my King around King here I have six seconds versus seven oh my goodness this is stressful this is stressful this is oh I think I'm gonna flag him he's just not gonna see this is check oh and now what would two seconds and now he has two seconds he has to make a move make a move make a move make a move oh he loses on time 500 ELO bullet just not just not it really just just not it um that wasn't I mean it was good content we had a combined accuracy of 35. not like 35 each like 17 to 18. um I don't really get the point of starting with A4 if then you're just gonna play pretty normally um this just strikes me as complete Randomness um they put the Knight there and they just left it there the whole game okay so foreign there is no lesson here um this is kind of just like going to a zoo exhibit kind of you know just looking at the animals and going oh there's animals in there and then maybe having a philosophical debate as to whether zoos are ethical or not I I I I don't this was I let's just let's just move on oh my goodness um let's play a rapid game Let's let's play rapid let's see how good okay I have white again I would really like a game with black can I can I try to get a game with the black people okay I get white again I all right what if I I want to see what they I mean I just had a game with black but that wasn't that wasn't real I think just.com is gonna just give me white again because it knows oh there we go okay we're playing somebody from is that in Bangladesh okay um I'm gonna be a 500 who plays the Sicilian Defense which is like the worst type of 500 because they think they have any ability whatsoever they don't but uh you know Bishop to B5 all right um that's a move it's not a move I've ever seen before this doesn't even have a name this 500 ELO player might have just invented a chess opening incredible um okay well what if I attack the bishop was there any don't go here because you're gonna you can get your Bishop trapped okay wow okay let's see Park I'm gonna attack the bishop again don't go here because then you're gonna get your Bishop trapped I don't this is why you should not develop Bishops before Knights because you know your Knights are going to those two squares okay you don't know where your Bishop is going right now the bishop is jumping around like a pinata I'm gonna move my Rook this was a good move now I wonder if my opponent is going to try to cheese me let's see are is 500 ELO okay that's not a bad move at all I'm gonna take this is opening up the bishop and I guess trying to get the queen into the game very nice now does my opponent see this tactic my Rook is hanging I can defend it with my queen I can move it to safety I can play Knight C6 which attacks this they can take wow played instantly and if takes there's Queen A7 amazing now I could have just moved my Rook I didn't have to take the bishop I could have just taken the L there I could have lost my knight and then saved my Rook now I'm just down a rook wow good opening now we need to catch up in development so I'm gonna develop my knight my opponent should also just develop attacking is fine because you're winning so this is all very reasonable but now my opponent cannot just do damage with the queen um I'm now going to very quickly develop I'm gonna play E6 I think they're gonna trade I think this person is actually quite yeah they're playing quite well but will they hang this see they've helped me activate my queen which could be a little dicey for them but there is this move which is a thing for sure targeting this but Knight F3 is just very reasonable here developing a knight defending the center yeah I just mentioned this move um I can defend this with my king or with my queen but I think what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna just like play I don't know maybe as aggressively as I can like give this check and then try to Castle he has the the opponent has C3 which is a very decent move and it's just pure chaos now um because I'm gonna Castle and now my king is safe I'm losing a bishop so I'm down a bishop and a rook potentially but I do still have a little bit of counter play um but if my opponent is smart they will find a way to consolidate this position they're not going to panic with all of this here they're going to realize my Rook is not really in the game they're going to realize my Bishop doesn't have any moves you don't have to panic you can play Bishop E3 King F1 Bishop E3 take long castles is very clean it's exactly what I did I just moved my Bishop um so this person has played very well very good tactics even though they're rated 500 um not a good opening but not like a terrible one either so very reasonable um so I think um I think so far so good let's just see if they Panic now right because I I am creating like some practical problems but it's it's nothing wow they did they found it they found the idea I think are they gonna Castle are they gonna get their King to safety this is crazy if they actually oh I don't know about that I don't know about that move but they do defend their Knight so let me attack are they gonna find the defense of the bishop or with the queen okay good move good move um remember I'm 500 so I just know how to move my queen a lot so I'm just going I'm now going to make 15 I'm gonna I'm gonna make ten Queen moves in a row I'm at one two three four all right I'm gonna make ten Queen moves in a row um let's take that's five five Queen moves in a row and then I'm just going to give checks because that's all I know how to do I'm not concerned with that because I have a challenge so that is now six Queen moves in a row and seven is on the way as well I don't think I'm not getting my seven you move anywhere oh I don't have any checks oh that's so brutal but what about the viewer challenge this is so bad what do I do oh I said I was gonna make 10 Queen moves in a row I forgot about my Rook do they remember about my Rook oh my gosh all right I'm going here one two three four five six seven eight eight Queen moves in a row I've made but they can go here I can't take the Rook I have to give a check oh my goodness is this 10 Queen moves in a row this is nine nine Queen moves in a row have been made okay ten Queen moves in a row I am a 500 ELO and all I know how to do is move my queen 11 Queen moves in a row H5 check I had to break the streak unfortunately there was no other Queen moves and I was probably going to get checkmated uh let's take the Rook okay Queen Bishops surrounding my king but my king is gonna get off the back rank so I'm not gonna get mated right away I do have my own ideas by the way uh this is crazy I might be surviving this I might be surviving this queen to C6 um okay does a 500 know about onpasson does a 500 rated oh they don't they don't know about on passo oh and now Queen to G4 is mate the reason my opponent lost this game is because they um I think they didn't really value King safety and so they had ways they could have shielded the king they could have done it with the Knight for example but they were this this person's very aggressive so this person no regard for King safety whatsoever and um and also just like playing a little bit too quickly you shouldn't play this quickly if it's a 10 minute game um but uh please don't go Queen takes G6 please please don't play that oh to take please don't resign I don't I don't even want to win this game you know I'm gonna resign oh thank you thank you for not resigning all right I you deserve it all right you deserve it I appreciate you being a good sport that's mate but I'm not in the business of taking people Zelo like this I you know I took the last guy but they'll get a refund I promise I'll ask chess.com I I called that from a mile away too um this person just needs to chill out a little bit like they're just playing a little bit too quickly um and even already here black had some winning opportunities I could have weaved the Checkmate now just no regard for King safety here the king should not be this active and I think this person is playing the game a little bit too much like a lottery just like rolling the dice and hoping for the best from the opening this person played super well um G4 is a ridiculously good move for this ELO um for this ELO it's technically not the best move because the bishop is gonna get trapped like I just said and that's why you should not develop the bishop before the nights you've got to develop the nights before the Bishops but this little Bishop takes Knight oh my goodness what a move what an opponent and then they played very well but um they were just so aggressive like they they were so aggressive the whole game and they should have dealt with the King safety sooner they should have developed a little faster and tried to Castle Queen side they didn't and they that's why their King was getting knocked around like a pinata uh also I made 11 Queen moves in a row which was pretty cool and probably the most instructive move of the game here is the move H5 uh because what this does is it makes my king now not open to any background problems otherwise this is just a back rank Checkmate uh and uh this move allows King H7 which actually ultimately won me the game because my king was able to just defend my Pawn and yeah I resigned but you know win the game win the game in quotes I feel like I should give y'all a reward for making it 22 minutes into the video so let's just end with one more fun Blitz game let's see what happens all right we're playing Black we're playing a a 518 player um let's ask this person if they've watched Gotham I realized I didn't ask the other two um okay instantly takes my Pawn this is the Scandinavian defense my queen is out and now I'm going to rotate it I didn't ask the bullet person because that was just that I I don't know okay good developing for the center very very nice um let's uh let's develop this is a this is not the right move all right they're trying to go after my my queen here uh let's uh pin a castle Knight to E4 is a discovered attack it's nothing really scary the queen is very safe opponent very quickly takes um Rook to B1 yeah but see the way my opponent has played this is that now I have two things on this now I actually have three things oh okay I okay clearly my opponent's strategy is to play as fast as possible um they are not really playing accurately and I really hope they don't do this because that's the entire reason my my Bishop is there okay good uh now I'm 500 so of course I'm gonna take the first thing that I see um Let's Play Bishop takes because I want to take the first thing that I see and now let's play hmm in reality I have like check I can activate my Rook I'm gonna go here because I'm making a battery with my queen let's see if my opponent sees that Rook D1 is reasonable Bishop here is reasonable Queen back is reasonable okay Rook D1 is played now I'm going to give a check because why not um we already had an end game so I'm Gonna Keep Queens on the board does my opponent see Checkmate in one because they saw that ah does my opponent see Checkmate in one a second time us uh a third time does my opponency Checkmate in one on the board on the board did they see it I think they're gonna move the bishop okay I don't know if they saw it but maybe they got lucky I don't want to Queen trade I want to go for the pawn maybe they're gonna go here okay okay I I I I don't know Bishop here I'm I'm losing a lot of Pawns in this process I'm setting up Checkmate in one once again they can give me a check first before dealing with it oh good move I'm now oh no not only can I check mate in one I can also Play Bishop takes H2 and win the queen but I'm 500 I don't know that Checkmate and one is still on the boat please don't go here don't go here because of you oh Bishop it's still made in one how many mates in One are we gonna sit through oh it's finally been stopped now I have Bishop C5 check and then I can win the queen I I it's still made in one though it it's just Checkmate it's Maiden one and the queen is hanging okay I think the only thing that I can do here is somehow forced to draw I I just I don't feel good about this one I'm gonna go here oh good move they took my Rook oh my goodness that's not mate though that's not made because I have this I can take but then I'm gonna lose this oh my goodness I have 30 seconds they're taking what Queen B8 right Queen B8 Chase my King around or queen to D4 check and then Queen to D5 Queen D4 Queen D5 has to do it what no why did you do that okay Rook G8 does my opponent see Queen D5 Queen D5 saving the day are they gonna go Queen G2 or here oh they found it nice I'm going for mate that's not even a mate rookie six check is the knockout punch okay good move yep good move good move Rook takes Rook takes check oh my goodness what a game please don't go Queen F2 check please just don't all right I have this is my only hope check we're just repeating oh no oh no is it gonna be a draw I'm attacking the ah this is crazy oh this is check oh this is check oh please block with the Rook don't block with the queen don't block with the queen Please block with the Rook so I can maybe make a draw oh my goodness oh my goodness wait and now there's 40 seconds left for my opponent oh this is crazy is this gonna be a draw can I get a draw here with four seconds on the clock four seconds on the clock is this a draw by repetition I'm gonna offer a draw four seconds versus 30. I'm offering a draw by repetition it's not because Queen can block and it's a check please don't go here ah oh no it was check no wait they didn't take my queen that's mate no it's not me because it's a pin wait why are they not taking my queen why doesn't I take my queen can I get stalemated I gotta get stalemated I got one second on the clock oh no no no no no no no no no no oh I lost I lost well that was a fitting conclusion to this video that was good I um I almost snuck away a draw I almost had my opponent fooled with four seconds versus 30 that I was repeating moves and unfortunately Queen G1 was found but they didn't take my queen so to summarize at the 500 level the openings are actually not that bad uh the 500s are getting very very good positions in the opening now there are very clearly different styles of play there's the blitz player that just plays as fast as possible this person was up like 40 seconds in the first stage of the game the last person that I played played fantastic in the opening even though the opening was shaky so you got the player that freestyles the opening but then it's really good tactically has very good instincts um just has to respect King safety a little bit more you got you know the the first player that I played which was a pretty you know back and forth game and they clearly had some plans but made some mistakes and then 500 ELO bullet might just be the worst thing ever so that is what 500 Hilo chess is like um I will probably do this again for 800 or 1000 ELO let me know in the comments what you would like and in the meantime I'm gonna go enjoy uh some dinner so I'll see you in the next video get out of here
