micro hdmi may very well be the worst mainstream connector on the market it's super compact while still carrying the same high quality video signals of its bigger more competent brother but it is the very definition of an achilles heel this four dollar part four dollars turned a 3 000 camera into a paperweight and the cost to have it repaired by a sony authorized service center 500 freedom dollars that is why today i will be taking matters into my own hands that is why right to repair matters and that is why i'm going to tell you about our sponsor in case i screw up this camera and i have to buy a new one build redux build redux makes it easy to configure your new build with support guides to help along the way they also offer competitive pricing as compared to building a pc yourself head to build redux dot com slash linus and start your new build today [Music] let's begin with a bit more backstory when i was shooting the sponsored ultimate streaming setup video for elgato a little while ago i was struck by how much more comfortable that setup was to use compared to my one at home and the reason for that is that at home i have to crank my key lights up so bright that they're uncomfortable to look at in order to get a clean image out of my cheap canon camera which got me thinking i'm not about to downgrade to a webcam but if i want a dslr or a mirrorless that has outstanding low light performance so i can turn those lights down what are my options here's one how about the a7s2 that we already own here at the studio but we haven't been using because it's broken i mean it's not completely broken i can turn it on and wait were we expecting that to happen did it magically start working uh this is inconvenient but also i'm happy ah okay this is one of those situations where it's it's working enough that it knows it's supposed to be working now just to demonstrate that it's not the cable what is this uh s5 oh yep there we go confirmed tv works cable works actually this is a this is a really important thing to bring up you guys might wonder why exactly the fact that the micro hdmi port on this camera not working is even a problem for us here in the studio and the answer is that while the camera does have a built-in display usually in a production environment you'd need a much larger one in order to make sure that you're maintaining focus so we'd hook up something like this external monitor from small hd that means that every hour this camera's in operation it's got something plugged into its micro hdmi port which eventually and we're talking in a matter of tens of hours or hundreds of hours not thousands of hours it is going to break 50 bucks gets you high quality solder flux and wick with the necessary applicators you'll spend anywhere from 25 to 100 depending on how baller you want to go for some kind of precision screwdriver set you'll need another hundred dollars in change for a soldering iron and a hot air station and 20 bucks for a mystery 21 ounce water bottle from lttstore.com and even after buying all of that stuff you are still going to be out ahead of what you would have spent on someone else doing it for you and now you own all these tools which is pretty cool honestly the biggest factor for me though was that i have nothing to lose if i break it so what i was already gonna have to replace it anyway and the only thing i really had to buy was 20 worth of micro hdmi ports so since this operation can clearly be done we actually found a guide on how to do it online though it omits the actual soldering because that's a service this person offers and his name isn't louis rossman i think we can put together the missing pieces here so this is where the scripted portion of this video ends and i start disassembling this camera wish me luck everybody got an exploded view of the camera right here and i talked to callanan who actually used to do a fair bit of this work at his old job and he says we are going to go in from the bottom and the back so that is where we'll start yeah this should be fine let's just see if it's loosened at all whoa hi yep look at that yep plate came right off wait and oh whoa that was exciting moment seems to be hampering me a little bit here i think i have to actually take the screen off and disconnect the ribbon on this side hold on i got this though i got this i'll get this all labeled in a sec famous last words yep there we go look at that is that a vapor chamber or is that just a copper spreader oh wow that's interesting look they're carrying heat way up here man i'm stressed i get really warm when i work on stuff like this like i don't want to break it and i also don't want to not get content out of it and i feel like if i break it it's not really a video i can't get it out past the sticker you might just have to force it a little there we go would you look at that did you just look at that wow it's actually really easy to change out the card slot this is as far in as you have to go and they've got it on its own daughter board so boom new sd card slot just like that because that's something i could see failing a lot too everything's under control also this copper shield is off now more cooling uh we've got made by micron presumably this is dram we've got sony's image processor uh wow this folded cable here is looks pretty challenging no no that's fine that's fine it's fine it's just a sticker calm down brandon calm down you're stressing everybody out chill time to start popping out the dozen or so ribbon cables all around this main board the good news is that the the cable memory should pretty much tell us where they all go back in look at that easy peasy easy more cooling more thermal pads oh wow so i misidentified this i think that i had said this looked like the main processor but i actually doubt that now and i had also said that maybe this was dram but i doubt that now too because this pin pattern looks like dram and it sits right under what looks like it might be some kind of integrated package i don't know much about the architecture of a camera this is all just kind of me making things up as i go so take it for what it is and that's it that's the culprit right there oh wow it's mangled no wonder it's broken the thing is it's not just like the resiliency of the pins inside you gotta understand there's a lot of strain on it from the weight of the cable and there's just no real getting around that okay it's getting real now oh god i did not label a thing i'm gonna write pcb question mark i'm pretty sure it is sanity check let's make sure we're removing the right thing here we want this guy cool right this feels like a lot of heat to be putting on this if we're having trouble getting it off we can try adding a little bit of flux not too much not that it'll harm anything but come on baby one moment please i'm starting to feel like this might have been a mistake go actually i think it's loosening i think i got it loose on the one side come on come on come on come on come on come on hey there we go oh my god now we need our soldering iron and our wick i named him john so we're just going to pick up all of our extra solder with this bad boy i've got most of the through holes cleared now i think it's clean here's the backside looks pretty good we've got five tries at this i have five micro hdmi connectors so here's the plan i'm gonna take this guy i'm gonna put it right there and all of those need to go exactly on all of those pads so we take this and we put some of the solder kind of over these contact points here and kind of spread it around a little bit that is not good let's just get rid of this again you can see there's a giant ball of solder uh across two pins in a couple of places here so i did put a little bit too much to grab the extra solder we're just going to take our tip which is clean and we're just going to throw some flux on there and we're going to try and kind of loosen that up and grab it so now basically what we flow it and go for it okay let's flux it up baby here we go shine for me baby this little light of mine i'm gonna let it shine once it's all silvery we just go for it oh god i blew it away oh boy okay so we have a slight problem when i put the heat on the micro hdmi it melts the plastic so basically i need to heat it up and then instantly absolutely nail the placement of this thing oh my god go on there hold still oh we were close that time it's not that it's off it's that the plastic melted and it looked like the back pins were on still but it's hard to tell okay all right i give up for today oh that is a that's a shame we're back ladies and gentlemen and we got solutions kyle from engineering said hey guys you need a hot plate well we don't have a hot plate and we don't have time to wait around for one so we've got a hot brick 145 degrees celsius ladies and gentlemen we baked that brick like the boss as we are now it's time to take another run at this without this giant ground plane here sucking up all the heat that we're trying to use to desolder our shiz so we'll get our let's get our hot air station we're going to try and pull this micro hdmi that we did manage to put on last time but didn't connect fully and we're getting up near 100 a hundo here we go oh oh that's a hot brick yep there we go and did it okay it's off again oh is it mangled you know what i think this might have actually survived andy i think we can take another crack with this play do you believe i believe yeah so i guess uh that's a that's a pretty big shot to your credibility right there the only reason that we're not putting flux on right now by the way is that there's already um like an ocean of flux on this thing oh i can't do this left-handed i just need to be able to steady my hand oh god stop it's so sticky so i have a slight problem a couple of the pins have bridged solder on them yep this one's a fail well this is our last crack at it falls oh god i think this is it i think this is the moment i need the microscope to know if it's lined up it ain't aligned see if the goal was to have it perfectly in between the pads then hashtag nailed it okay i'm trying to pull this off as cleanly as i can here because if i bend these pins we're not going to be able to put it back on i think i got it should i go for gold and try the last connector because i think part of the problem is that this one's got some gunk on it it's making it hard to get it in place it is lined up i'm gonna go check under the microscope i got the sign off from kyle he says that it doesn't appear as though what is going on here how did this happen one of these ribbons is busted shoot that is not repairable um unfortunately now the question becomes do i need that where does it go i was hoping to put it together just a little to see if it fires back up and if we can test it before we completely close it up oh i'm so upset right now i actually cannot tell where this plugs into right now so why don't we just leave it for the time being see what happens wow this is an absolute nightmare to install i don't know how they build these things at the factory the issue is just that there's no way to get my fingers in there and apply any force to it whatsoever it's just i'm just relying on the stiffness of the ribbon to go to push it in but it's not enough oh my god go get the f in there i don't understand this god my level of pissed off is so high right now so if i'm lucky the functions that are not connected will be ones that i don't need i would have to get extremely lucky for that though like we're talking horseshoes up my ass lucky i say if we get a signal from the hdmi port we we end the video there even though the camera itself is not fixed because that was the goal definitely makes me feel better about how much cameras cost i did plug in what remains of the ribbons so ow it's entirely possible that it is still plugged in okay so no sd card reader but everything else should fundamentally be connected no life no smoke no sparks but no life so i need a new top housing among other things okay well we have to call it here for now we'll have to resume once we get some replacement parts ordered we're gonna do this i'm gonna hate every moment [Music] oh thank god oh i have to pull the whole thing out yeah that's what i thought why do you need to pull that out though because it's connected to the main one no i have to take it apart even more [Music] hey there we go okay so i think if we stop at this point like filming i can figure out the soldering off camera because honestly that's gonna be long and boring a few moments later all right time to put this back together [Music] all right before i fully close this out yeah we usually would get a oh yeah it works everything flickered which is good [Music] it is now some time later and the saga is finally over as it turns out the original board the one that i fixed actually does work it just powers off intermittently which might be due to damage from the heat of the soldering iron we learned a valuable lesson about preheating your entire board before going at it which is great but unfortunately it did cost us a new board which was just under 400 us dollars that was installed courtesy of this guy thanks and we were getting this really weird awful green output so initially we thought okay maybe we screwed up a cable or something like that but as it turns out the potential need for sony software or calibration was a very real need so we ended up needing to send it to a sony service center pay about 200 to get our sensor calibrated for this particular border rather the board calibrated for this particular sensor and now it works absolutely perfectly in fact you already saw me deploy it in the video where i showed off my new gaming setup it's amazing best webcam like ever and best segue to our sponsor squarespace if you want
