hi friends we are live okay we are doing a very exciting video today actually you know what let me cut here to the unboxing of this because it was so much fun i got a package we're gonna unbox it together and this is not any package this is a new computer and i'm not going to tell you what computer it is until the unboxing let's go okay i need a knife or something safety first tiffany [Music] don't do this at home kids it just looks like an open box guess what it is another box [Music] did you guess what it is if you know me you know what it is you know i'm a huge apple girl the new macbook air with the n2 chip i feel like a kid at christmas here we go this is the first opening together okay this is my favorite part this doesn't even do it justice i feel like i need to go outside because the color is just like are you ready [Music] okay so as you can see from the unboxing i just received my delivery just received the package in the mail of the new apple macbook air m2 youtube and i have been waiting counting down the daisy ever since the announcement i've been counting down for this and usually we do these videos sitting at my uh studio where i film i mean it's right behind me let's not try and get too fancy here uh but i wanted to do this video in a very candid way because i feel like it's more my style just to sit and talk with you and just have a very candid conversation and go through this new computer what i love about it what i was looking forward to most uh what it is like as a content creator and a software developer to use this computer so let's let's just dive right into it okay so let's talk a little bit more about the details surrounding this new macbook air this macbook air features the make safe it returns back to the macbook air and it also features two thunderbolt ports for connecting tons of different accessories it has a 3.5 millimeter audio jack and it also features a magic keyboard with a full height function row it has touch id and it has a very spacious force touch trackpad so everything you love about macbook air kind of elevated speaking more about the 13.6 liquid retina display one thing that stood out to me when i started playing around on the computer right away was just how the the display has been expanded closer to the sides and up and around the camera portion so it makes room for the menu bar and i noticed this right away because the display instantly appears larger and it's more of a immersive experience whether you are relaxing and watching netflix which i will definitely be doing tonight or you know doing homework studying whatever the case may be so some of the things with this new macbook air it includes a brighter display higher resolution camera all day battery life actually up to 18 hours which is so key i can't even tell you i always used paul my partner his macbook air uh when we were traveling especially because the battery life is just next level and it's so key when you're traveling i mean even when i'm going to my co-working space or anything and it's one of those things you don't realize until you work with a computer that doesn't have good quality battery life and you're like wow battery life is really important and it also has four beautiful finishes and the choices for the finish include midnight space gray silver and starlight so there is a lot to choose from let's talk about the computer i specifically got so i got the 13.6 inch liquid retina display and so it is a larger display and it also is 25 brighter than the previous macbook air also the first thing i did the first thing i always do when i get a new computer is facetime probably my mom or paul i don't know why it is and i was really excited to do so when i heard that the video calls look and sound amazing i kept on hearing reviews on this of how great the facetime hd uh camera is and i needed to test it out actually you know what let's let's test it out you won't it won't quality won't come through on the camera fully but as i'm sure but let's let's have some fun test it out having a great camera is more important than ever these days so macbook air features a new 1080p camera with twice the resolution and twice the low light performance of the previous air combined with the processing power of m2's advanced image signal processor you'll look great on video calls also something that is very noticeably different about this macbook air that i noticed right away from the design aspect is just how thin it is it is actually 20 less volume than the previous generation so it is only 11.3 millimeters thin which is crazy so it is extremely lightweight it is extremely it's one of those things that especially if you are going to work uh co-working keep on using co-working space because i work out of one but if you're going to a working space traveling anything like that this computer it literally it's so light and it takes up such little room in your backpack okay for all of you programmers out here this is for you and you will really enjoy this if you're not a programmer you might or even if you're a content creator you'll understand which is let's talk about fan this is a fanless design so what does that really mean well the m2 enables incredible performance in a fanless design so the macbook air is completely silent no matter how intense the task so for any of you out there who are running really intense programs you know what i'm talking about when you're coding your code is compiling or you are waiting for your video to finish it's it can get really loud sometimes and with this design you will not have any of that which is huge another thing i wanted to talk about for this computer which i've never spoken about in any reviews for uh products really is about the environment and this is something that i think consumers i know consumers are becoming more and more conscious about i know i am especially as you see your old devices piling up and wondering what is going on how is this affecting the environment and i really like that apple puts a huge highlight on this today as of today apple is actually carbon neutral for global corporate operations and by 2030 they plan to have a net zero climate impact across the entire business for the macbook air it is designed with the environment in mind and you know sometimes companies say that but like what are the actions behind that and what i really like about this is there is actions it's actually a hundred percent recycled aluminum in its enclosure and it's the first apple product to use certified recycled steel and this is something i think that we will see more and more of as apple leads the way as far as uh with these environmental initiatives go because it's the way of the future and i definitely think as a consumer that is a huge a huge uh impact on buying decision is how are they helping the environment so go apple okay next up what's next i don't know what's next one second here and as a content creator i sometimes have to edit my editor is probably laughing at me right now because he edits most of my things but for a little for different kind of projects that are too when i'm really slacking and i can't pass them on to him uh i have the best editor in the world by the way for intense workloads for editing complex things and timelines in final cut pro it is actually this macbook air is actually 40 faster than the previous generation i have linked this computer down below i mean you know you know where to go find it but it was a computer that i ran out for because i feel as though as i mentioned the beginning of this video i was always using paul's old macbook air and when the new one came out with the m2 chip i knew i needed to jump on it quickly okay i hope you enjoyed this review of the new macbook pro air i'm really excited about it from both a content creator side from a programming side from just like a full a full 360 full 360 of it so i'm gonna go play with it thanks everyone if you haven't already make sure to subscribe and i'll see you all soon [Music] you
