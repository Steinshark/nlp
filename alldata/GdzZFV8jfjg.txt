so what was what was the question tell me again uh what was the first computer game I played I'm setting up Sean's new sound check 2023 we need a new sound check question Steve suggested what's the first computer game you ever played what was the first game you played computer game well the first computer game I ever remember playing was actually written by my dad um he wrote a matching pairs type game that um on a commodor pet I think it was with the first computer I used I was about four at the time and that's pretty much the first one I remember playing of sort of more traditional computer games with sort of tradition computer game authors and things um o uh I remember a version of painter on the BBC micro and things like The Hobbit on ZX spectrum and so on so yeah that that dates me a bit first computer game or first computer game you were aware of um wrote myself mace uh walking through the through mace program on on a v 2,200 in 1976 Okay so still got it no was it challenging or did you was it just fun I wouldn't myself and for my friends but the writing of it was it fun was it did you enjoy sure was was was great fun I mean so the first video games I I played the the writing was more fun than than than playing them yeah yeah okay actually the game I knew about which I never played uh was a game where you should cross a road and there were cars coming yeah and then I wrote my own version where you had to hit as many cars as possible I'm just going to check first at the uh um the the audio is working so can you can you remember your first uh computer game that you ever played or my first computer game I ever played was a game on the old Amika something called gold corn I was like three or four years old oh yeah and did you did you complete it did you just of course not it's so difficult called even though when I tried when I was a older yeah yeah that was is the one of the first very members I remember playing a video game I don't know why I asked if you completed it because the game that I loved and remember I still haven't completed in 30 years later but when I was older I completed an old Zelda from asess that I haven't completed when I was a kid for the simple reason of that when I was a kid my English was not that good I couldn't understand what to do and then when I was older I said oh jeez that was easy it tells you what to do yeah can you tell me about your first computer game or the first game you played or the first game you saw the first game I remember playing a lot was pilot Wings on the snz my dad got a snz for Christmas so Super Nintendo Entertainment System you got a snz for Christmas and let us play every Thursday and then about 3 months later I remember getting up in the middle of the night being thirsty going down for a drink and finding my dad playing pilot wings and just being so let down that he didn't invite me to play it with him and he just said no go to bed go to bed go to bed and I was like this is this is so unfair and that that was my first story and that's that's when I realized that parents don't do what they say sometimes oh well the grown-ups get to do what they want yeah I guess never understood um but yeah I have I have full memories of that game what was your first computer game oh CRS um other early ones that I remember um Horus Horus and the spider sticks in the memory is one of the earliest ones I remember on the zedex Spectrum horis goes skiing I remember yeah horis goes skiing as well sort of Frogger redressed and then the skiing one tied on the end that one was but yeah Horus go skiing Horus and the spiders some of the early Z Spectrum ones Scrabble was one Dad loved playing that so that was always about The Hobbit that was a fascinating one we should do a computer file on The Hobbit written by Philip Mitchell and Veronica megler who's now AWS it was sort of virtually The Hobbit that he played as a text based adventure game with some graphics but Veronica I believe had written a very impressive parone physics system for the whole thing so it sort of as you played it the characters would carry on doing things in the background it would understand English or English as they put it with an i um far better of the most text-based adventure games and you used to get things like Thorin sits down and sings about gold or Ty passes as you sort of sat and do it so yeah that sticks in the mind don't think I ever completed it but it was definitely uh fun when you're sort of five or six year old what was your first ever what was the first game computer game you played or that you were aware of okay so one certainly a very early one that I can remember is on the the zx81 which is the machine I I learned on and as a young kid I it's an amazing game it's it's 3D but done in incredibly blocky low resolution and the sell of it is that you're being chased around a 3D maze by a Tyrannosaurus but it is 1981 so the graphics aren't brilliant and it starts off with a little blob in the distance but underneath there's this text saying Rex can hear you Rex is getting closer and this little blob jerks towards you there's only about four or five frames of Animation but the final one is teeth closing over you if you've really messed up and uh yeah yeah for like 10 year old me it was a real heart pounding moment um so just checking the microphones working then and what was your the first computer game you played or um Tetris obviously um it's it was very addictive I remember people played it so much that somebody told me that he observed their all parking cars it was one free spot and then somebody parked in and they fully expected them to all disappear fantastic and then um in my part-time job when I was a student my boss played the blockout it was it now forgotten 3D version of Tetris oh wow okay which actually requires quite you know an impressive um spatial like uh perception and Imagination because you can also twist uh turn them in Space the the pieces so you can rotate them in different yes the can be rotated different ctions and they are properly threedimensional they're not just you know expanded two dimensional ones and she was excellent she was like it was um I couldn't even see the pieces it was like very early on on comput F we had one contributor he was world champion Tetris oh wow okay amazing um just so I can check the mics working what was your first computer game or what was the first game that you played first computer game obviously the Pokemon ones are the best um but I I think I probably played Mario before that I was very much a Game Boy okay sounds good sounds good yeah bit of Super Mario yeah um I'm trying to think what that my first introdution to Mario would have been I think I kind of came in with Super Mario Kart which is quite quite late on in maros anyway actually before we start just so I can check that the levels are okay um what was your first computer game that you played or a computer game the first Compu probably Prince of Persia Prince of Persia okay what that noise probably I don't recall and then I probably played loads of Pokémon Pokémon all right okay makes sense how do it sound yeah that was [Music] good oh that's very difficult I can't remember it's so long yeah what was the first one you remember enjoying playing then should mean okay so first it's bit difficult because I was still in China at that time so I only know by the Chinese name okay was in Chinese no I don't that so these are the ones which you have the kind of different levels to the games you have floors yeah and you connected by letters you go up and down being chased by something you try to avoid those yeah okay yeah I know the time I know the sort of thing but do you know the name or yeah so maybe something like um we used to play one called mic Miner and one called Chucky egg okay um but then more advanced ones yeah all sorts first one I played was probably Sonic on the Master System that was good fun probably never got past level one cuz I can't remember how old I was but very young um first one I really remember getting into a bit older was Age of Empires 2 um which was absolutely fantastic and I've been an RTS gamer pretty much ever since my father used to have a ZX Spectrum so I played a tick attack and a game called River raid and mic Miner and stuff like this but only at the very beginning a little bit I didn't play on it much plus you could never get the tape to Lad could you and then you know into the '90s we used to play games like doom and things like that and I still do actually I think you're the first person who's mentioned doom and that's a travesty actually I I yeah I mean I I actually play Doom and Doom 2 this year right I still play them because I dis like them a lot what was the first computer game you played or were aware of tell me about that that's that's our soundcheck question for the year wow that's a great question um so age seven at a friend's house I saw a spectrum 48k playing the very very simple Flight Simulator game that came I don't know if it came with it but it one like the Horizon thing that came with though you know which was like bundled around or was like adjacent to like Sinclair research and I was I that was the first game I ever saw I thought wow and then according to Folklore my parents they uh my friend then quit the thing quit the the the the flight simulator and then he uh typed in a little program and just all these numbers were scrolling up the screen you know the basic that came with it and my mom said she'd never seen me so captivated by anything and as a result of that for my eighth birthday I got a spectrum so and you know 40 years later I am I'm still very thankful for seeing Ian pook's computer or whoever it was I think that was his name you know from from like you know 1983 you know then a career in in coding gaming and stuff absolutely yeah yeah exactly that is a lot can be traced back to that one that one moment like so many of us I'm sure we have yeah first computer game that I remember playing was uh Sim City Sim City 1 okay was it good was you in retrospect no but at the time it was amazing yeah yeah yeah yeah did you was that the one way you could send like a a massive Alien Invasion and destroy the city was no that was Sim City 2000 which which is a much better game to be fair yeah I do remember doing that anyway anyway microphone is definitely working I've done the sound shck question you haven't I about the uh computer game yes I think I suggested that one yeah you might have done I can't remember in the spiders or The Hobbit or something something similar y fantastic yeah I see I keep thinking about mine and I dily Thompson's decathlon was a big one I remember seeing someone playing the text game that I think was The Hobbit at the time but I remember what the first one I played was probably Atari combat if I'm honest that's probably it uh right we are recording um recing what are we going to be looking at today then
