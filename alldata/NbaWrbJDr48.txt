- Sit on the toilet behind you. Yeah, it's a little high up. Sorry about that. Last one of you to get off the toilet gets a chance at $1 million. (contestants cheering) And as weird as this sounds,
I'm actually being serious. Here's what I mean. You are currently watching the
third video of this series. The first video is "Last to Fall" and the second was
"Last to Stop Swinging." The winners of these four videos will compete in a fifth
video for $1 million. So we grabbed some toilets. We put some people on the toilets and we grabbed a million dollars. And now we're here. And today's video special. Chandler's actually the
coach of two people, - Josh and Brian. - And Chris is also the
coach of two people. - Jenna and George. - If you guys win, Chandler gets a hundred
grand of the million. Same with Chris. So they're motivated. Feel free to make them do anything. And you guys can't rest
your feet on this thing. They have to remain dangling, 'cause you're literally
just sitting on a toilet and it can't be too easy. All right. It begins. (toilet flushes) So you've been on this
toilet for about two minutes. How do you feel? - I feel nothing. - Same, I know. You've been on a toilet for
two minutes and 20 seconds. How do you feel? - It's pretty comfortable. - They've both been training. They spend a lot of time on the toilet. - You've been on the
toilet for three minutes. How do you feel? - I feel like a solid stool. - [Chandler] Good job. - How do you feel? It's been about three and a half minutes. - Feel good. And I've spent a lot of time on the toilet practicing for just for this day. - As did I.
- Made for this. - So, Chandler, which of your
two people is your favorite? - Oh, you gonna do that? - You could have just said both. (upbeat music) So we have a baby doll and a trash can. If you make it in the
trash, you get nothing. But if you miss, we jacked
up your toilet very slightly. Start off with you. - You got this. Sink it. Buckets. (buzzer buzzes)
- [All] Oh! - Since you missed, we have to call in the plumber and he's gonna move
your toilet up slightly. If you won't notice much of a difference, it's on the first pump. How many did you do? So then we have to do two per. Do you notice the difference? - Nope. - After about 50, you'll
probably be literally hanging. Throw away that baby doll.
(buzzer buzzes) Plumber. There we go. With time, he'll go
higher, higher, higher. Here's a little sneak peek
of what it'll looks like at the end. Yes, he knows what not to do. (buzzer buzzes) Give him a crank. Your turn, sir. (buzzer buzzes) - Jenny, how you feeling? - Pretty good. Gonna win it. - [MrBeast] How you feeling right now? - A little softer, but still firm. - Feeling good. I'm definitely ready to win this. - Here's a magazine. Here's a magazine. Here's a magazine. Here's a magazine. We're about to do an hour long time lapse. And I didn't want you guys bored. (upbeat music) Here's a plunger. Here's a plunger. Here's a plunger. Here's a plunger. Chandler, we have four bowling balls. - Oh, those are actual bowling balls. - What do you think we're
doing with these balls? - Bowling?
- No. - We're gonna see if they can
pick 'em up with a plunger. First one to do it wins. - Is that possible?
- Yes. - How far do they have to pick it up? - Just an inch off the ground. - All right. - There's a certain way to do this. It's top secret. Okay, so whoever stops trying
last is actually the winner. It's literally impossible. You can't pick a bowling
ball up with a plunger. You wanna give us to countdown? - Three.
- Go! (dramatic music) - [Cameraman] Can you reach? (dramatic music) - [Brian] Got it. - [Chandler] Oh, he got it, he got it. - [Cameraman] Was it not
supposed to be, be possible? - You can't pick up bowling
balls with a plunger. - The challenge was whoever
got mad and quit first won, but you actually got it. You won in an unconventional way. How can this plunger
pick up a bowling ball? We're gonna give you some Squatty Potty so you can rest your legs. - [Brian] Helping us out? - Nope. I need something else. - [Chandler] Here you go, sire. - You now get it for five minutes. So do you feel relieved? - Yes, a lot actually. Brings all the pressure off my leg. - Yo, we have the same hat.
- Wow. - All right, what can I get you guys that will make it easier? - A lot of Snickers.
- Snickers. - Maybe a dog? - That's a lot more difficult than candy, but I'll look into it. I guess if a dog will help me get a hundred thousand
dollars, I'll get her a dog. If that's really what she wants. All right, I got you guys candy. I'm working on the dog. I know you want some Snickers bar. I think there's some Snickers in there. Yeah. And I got gummy bears, and I know you like the Sour Patch Kids. You guys are gonna do great. Gonna help me out. Let's do it. The dog that has been requested. Oh, she came right to you. Does that make things easier for you? - Yeah.
- Oh. - Yeah, I love dogs. - Does anybody else wanna see the dog? - [Josh] Absolutely.
- You wanna pet him? - Oh, that sucks, get a better fit. - Chris, like, honestly, I'm starting to not like you at all now. - You had your feet up
so it's easier, yep. - I hate to ruin your
pooping conversation, but your five minutes is up, sir. So we're just gonna. There we go. (upbeat music) - Josh, what would you like to eat? - Chicken nuggets. - All right, what would you like? - I want something that you
recommend that's from this area. - Why do they always do this to me? - I'm gonna get our food delivered. So I'm gonna give you guys the phone. Y'all pass it back and forth,
get whatever y'all want. It's on me. We got the Popeye's. We got some nuggies. We got tarter sauce and ranch. Who got tartar sauce? What's wrong with you? - [Cameraman] Your coach got
you food and Chandler didn't. - [MrBeast] There's no way. - [Cameraman] Oh! - Oh my god! I will never hit that in a million years. - Turn the lights red. This is very serious. Take this plunger and do a plunger flip. - [Chris] You got it. Don't worry. Any second now. - Plunger flip. Plunger flip. And if you land it like that, you win and we'll put two Squatty Potties If you don't and you land it
like that, we do two cranks. This is a big deal. We're gonna go down the line. This is why the lights are red. It's a big deal. (buzzer buzzes) - This is gonna be hard. You ain't gotta do 'em like that, man. - Here you go. - All day. (buzzer buzzes)
Except for today. - Just nail this and
everything will be fine. - I got it. - I can't believe he just did that. (buzzer buzzes)
(Jenny laughs) Fourth time. - [Cameraman] He doesn't win these. (buzzer buzzes)
Oh. Too much back spin on it. - If you're ever in a MrBeast video, practice your plunger flips. - All right, you've had a couple of pumps. How do you feel? - Feel great. - So you can take a couple of pumps. How about you? - Pumped up, got a lot of energy left. - Get it. - Chris, we forgot something. - What? - Lights back to normal. - Oh we did forget it, thank you. Thank you. You guys are gonna win it. And then one of you is gonna win. I don't know who that's gonna
be, but you're gonna do great. - All right, Josh.
- Senpai. - Had a lot of cranks back there. - Yeah.
- You leaning a little bit. So how are you doing? - I'm doing fine. - Good luck, duck.
(duck quacks) (upbeat music) - There is a million dollars on the line. What would you buy if you won? - A house, a car, pay off parent's debt. - Chris, with your a hundred
grand what would you buy? - A lot of food. Like a lot.
- Good. - Unhealthy amount. - If you won the million
dollars, what would you buy? - A Pomeranian. - How about you, sir? - I would buy my mom a house, and I would put more money
into my YouTube channel. I need to buy my house as well. - Two houses, okay, okay. - I would definitely buy a house, probably pay off my mom's
house and get a car, and then just spend
much of money on my son. - Oh, that's sweet. I kind want you to win. - I kind of want me to win too. - But only one of you guys wins. - I'm gonna get another car. I'm gonna get a really, really nice car, and probably an animal. (upbeat music) - Hey, Chandler, you can flush
all your hopes and dreams of winning down the drain. - Oh, what'd you say to me? - (screams) TP! Ow! (Chris grunting) Don't you throw a plunger at me! - That should've took
care of that right there. - Can I just borrow this, sir? - I bought this for my contestant. - Make it in mouth and we'll
give him a Squatty Potty. - That's risky, sir. - Oh! Give him a Squatty Potty! - We'll give you a Squatty
Potty when we're done. (buzzer buzzes) - [Cameraman] You hit
her right on her shirt. - All right.
(drum rolls) All right. Two people have won so far. - Two for two! Here you go. - [Cameraman] They both get them. - [Brian] I had it. - You're welcome. We're gonna call his mommy. Here's your son, see?
(Jorge's mother screams) He's sitting on a toilet and
if he's the last one to leave, he gets to compete for a million dollars. (Jorge speaks in foreign language) - Baby, suck it up.
- I am. - I love you. I love you. - Hey mom.
- Hello. Showing those boys what the girls can do. - Girl power! - You can think about if
you win getting that dog. - Oh, my goodness. - [Josh's Mom] You know
what you're fighting for? You can do this. You're strong, whole lot of
rooting over here for ya. - Especially for grandma. - Grandma is smiling down on you. She's fighting with you. - Love you, mom.
- You're awesome. Hang in there, love you. - Love you. - [Recording] You have
reached the voice mailbox. - She hung up I think. - Since your mom didn't pick up, the next best source of
motivation is Domino's. - [Dominoes Worker] Thank you
for calling Domino's Pizza, please hold. - Okay, that's fine. We've been on hold for three minutes. I'll call Papa John's. - [Papa John's Worker]
Papa John's (indistinct), how may I help you? - Hey, so I have a gentleman here who's competing in a
challenge and if he wins, he competes for a million dollars. I was just curious if you
had anything to motivate him. - [Papa John's Worker] Wow, okay, dude. For a million dollars,
like, just go at it, man. A million dollars! A chance at it, like, come on now. Let's do it. - [Cameraman] Let's go! (Chandler clapping) - Thank you.
- I love you. - Give me 10 pizzas. Howdy, good sir, come on in. What do you think they're doing? - Trying to stay on the toilet longest. - Yeah, actually, that's
exactly what they're doing. Just so you know, he called
Domino's and they ignored him. - Domino's. - How much was the pizza? Pizza was 26 something. - Perfect. Oh wait, sorry, there's a little bit more. There you go. - Wow. Oh. Okay. - They've been competing for 13 hours and you've won more money. - Hey, good luck. (upbeat music) - Bring it on in, Jakey. As you guys know, we have
the Unicorn of Wealth. He brings many great prizes to
the next person who gets out. - [Contestant] Oh. - Our prizes for today are an Oculus. A Switch.
- Wow. - Xbox One, iPhone, a laptop, AirPods. - [Chris] Oh, he's covering his face 'cause he can't resist the temptation. - Dude, I need a laptop. I'm gonna have to kindly reject it. - I have every single one of those. - Oh my gosh. She said I have every single one of those. - Get it outta here, Jake. - Get the unicorn outta here. - Get outta here, Brian. Since no one wanted Brian
aka the Unicorn of Wealth, I think we should do two pumps. - Two pumps it is.
- Yes. We clearly need to speed this up. - Only for the black team? - Yeah, sure. One, two. Would anyone like another one? Okay, of course. - They owe me for the white team. - Let's do it. - That's three. All right.
(upbeat metal music) (sink shatters) - I didn't expect that to break like that. - We're almost 24 hours in. You guys have to be getting tired. - What's tired? - He kinda reminds me of Omar. Just not creepily staring. - Yeah, Omar did kind
of just stare at people, but he is a good guy. - Any takers? You're tired. - You're tired. There's no shame in the game. You've lasted longer than
Chandler could ever dream to last. - If you're not gonna be
good for like another day you might as well just end it now. There's no need.
(dramatic music) (all applauding) Our first contestant is out. - Give her respect. This is good grapes right. - Good grapes. - Good sportsmanship. - Bye. Thanks for coming out. - Jenny, what was going through your head? - It's like 35 degrees in here. I just wanted to go home. - I feel that. All in all, good time, right?
- Mm-hmm. I lasted 20 hours on a toilet. - [Jenny's Dad] Oh, really? Okay, so you did win some stuff? - Yeah I did. So it was like, and then,
oh, I got a thousand bucks. - [Jenny's Dad] Oh, well that's great. - There are now only two
other people besides you. - I'm gonna keep the ka-ching going. - You are Chris's last chance
of a hundred thousand dollars. For Chris, you have one shot left. - I will not miss the
opportunity, mom's spaghetti. - First, we need to celebrate
a contestant getting out. And what better celebration
than three pumps? I think that sounds like
a great way to celebrate. (all applauding)
- Yay. Everyone's tired. (upbeat metal music) - All three of your toilets are literally at like this incline. Dang, that's crazy. Now we're gonna FaceTime the winner of part one of this series, Akira. How's it going? - Pretty good. How are you?
- Great. I wanna introduce you
to the three people left in this challenge, and I want you to tell me
what you think of them. - He looks all right on. Aw, no, he looks too comfy. He's fighting for family. Same thing as me.
- I know. Gonna be tough to beat. - What's your advice, man? - Whatever you're up there for, just keep thinking about that. It's just a mental thing at this point. You're fighting for your kid, right? Just think about them. That's it's for. - Appreciate it, man. - Can you pick a number
between one and five? - Three.
- Okay, three pumps it is. Thank you, Akira. You can thank Akira. - Bet you a hundred bucks
that Jorge's gonna win. - Make it a thousand. - Thousand bucks.
- 10,000. - Easy now.
(both laughing) Don't let me down. - Since things are starting to get hard, next person to get up,
I'll give you $10,000. - Dang. - It's about getting my mom a house, bro. - Those 10 G's though, What about those 10 G's? Change someone's life. - Give us more pumps.
- Okay. - [MrBeast] Do you want more pumps? Five more pumps. Five more pumps. - This is about get very difficult. - Not for Jorge. - Two.
- We're here? - Three. - He's a machine. He doesn't even feel it, man. - I have strong cheeks. (light hip hop music) - 10 G's right here, but
Omar is a freak of nature. Whoever wins here, you're
literally going up (gasps). - [Cameraman] Whoa. Whoa. - I was not expecting that. - You get the golden roll too. - 10,000. What? Ah, I like this sly dog. You tried.
(triumphant music) - This is for mama. This is for the family. - [Josh's Mom] Hello. - Hey, ma, I didn't win a million dollars. - [Josh's Mom] Okay. - But I have a little good news for you. - [Josh's Mom] What's that? - I won $10,000. - [Josh's Mom] Get outta freaking town. - Yeah, I won $10,000. - Well it's for us. - [Josh's Mom] We love you.
- Aw, thank you. Thank you for having your son. - Brother Beast. Bless, guys. Thank you. - Now it's a one on one. His body is in peak physical shape. Look at this.
- Abs on abs. - Look, he's sitting down and he has abs. Look at my stomach. I'm standing.
- Yeah, Chris. - All right, we didn't have
to actually mock it, but yeah. All right, I'm just gonna go over here. - We're gonna win this million bucks. - This has been going on too long. - Yes. - What are we? 33 hours in? That's a lot of hours, don't you agree? - Agreeance.
- I very much agree. - Go ahead and raise the toilets. This is where you were. And so he hammered it in to here. - [Jorge] Oh my goodness. (dramatic music) - If you got out now we can
make it 10 grand so it's even. - I mean, 10 grand will
be better than nothing. - But it's up to you, man. I mean, if you think you can
beat him, I would stick it out. - I'll offer him a hundred
G's if he quits now. - What? If you win today and then you
win the million dollar series, you'll give 'em a hundred grand. - Correct.
- Shake on it. He shook on it. If you want get up.
- What a deal, bro. Whoa! (Chris cheering) - Yeah, we did it! - [Cameraman] Hold on. - Good game, bro. - [Cameraman] He's just doing
pushups right now, what? - He said he was gonna be
so energized afterwards. - I thought he has a
25% chance of winning, so I will take my chances
on a hundred grand, aside from the 10 grand. - You are gonna compete
for a million dollars. $1 million. You're going against Akira. You're going gets Omar.
- Against who? - He's got a fighting spirit. - All right, all right. But a million dollars will be on the line. - I'm gonna do whatever it
takes to prepare for this. If you win, Chris gets a hundred
grand for being your coach. He gets a hundred grand. And you're only gonna get
$800,000, which isn't much. Yo, you sure that's still
plenty to satisfy you? - Plenty.
