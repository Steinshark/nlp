um tiff's trying not to kill us right 
now i know i'm trying to this could   be the last video ever posted so i hope 
you've all enjoyed tiffany take time to   enjoy the victories in between so 
therefore it seems like there are my 17th scam call of the day   gotta love these scammers they're they're 
obviously feeling no stress right now i've been having these thoughts lately that i've 
been coding for almost five years professionally   and it's been great but i feel like there's 
so many other skills that are not fully being   utilized and i feel like i got the coding thing 
to a point where i'm super happy with it you know   it's a huge challenge at first now i'm like in a 
good rhythm and i don't know i just want to use   other skills and that's something i'm 
working through and figuring out for myself   um i love coding and it's something that on the 
side i will do forever and you know build little   projects and you know if you go to my tick tock 
for example there's tons of little different like   we build hangman together we build different 
projects and anyways this is where my head's   been out lately and i've just been trying to work 
through it i feel like i'm in the next stage of   growth and evolution and just trying 
to figure out what that looks like   but uh before we dive into it and this vlog 
even more make sure to hit that subscribe   button for more tech and coding related videos 
and i guess let's just start this day let's go okay so we are going out for dinner right now 
and i thought it'd be really fun to introduce you   to my secret weapon so some of you have met paul 
before some of you haven't he's holding the camera and what i mean oh you got it we 
got a seat belt situation hold on   like 20. living on the edge here driving 
through our neighborhood hold on oh god   the camera's all over the place it's like the 
blair witch project here hold on oh my goodness okay let's do it all right um so anyways so in 
my last vlog i was talking a little bit about   imposter syndrome and stress and really how i 
navigate that and honestly almost everything i   all my emotions and my feelings i like paula 
is my boyfriend but he's also my therapist   i feel like you should get paid extra unpaid 
therapists just for the record books there   please everyone so i wanted to i thought it'd 
be an interesting video to kind of walk through   with you just how i navigate stress and advice 
from paul on it so i'm not right now but the past   few weeks i've been having a lot of stress just 
at work and personal life and stuff like that   and it's just like consumed me and i feel like 
you have been giving me some really good advice   well why thank you i try i mean i think a lot of 
the advice i give you is a product of me being   you know substantially older and having done a lot 
of different careers and jobs and had businesses   and had losses in my life had real trials and 
tribulations so i think when you're younger   you you don't have as much of a you don't have 
as much of a road map to um compare to yeah so   you know for me it's like i've seen a lot of the 
situations you get stressed out about i've seen   them before and you know it's everything's always 
going to be okay you know you always have to uh   remember that i think one of the biggest things 
i'm kind of interrupting you here but one of the   biggest things for me and i think a lot of people 
often feel is almost like is it ever going to get   better am i ever going to get out of this or 
like making a mountain out of a molehill and   i guess how do you deal with that when something 
so something comes up and he just overwhelms you   how do you kind of break it 
down and make it manageable   yeah i think that the way i do it is you 
know i really break it down to the most   smallest components and it's like you know am 
i going to go to jail for this am i going to   die from this no no and no so the answer is you 
know is anyone i care about or love going to be   hurt by this no sometimes we get so caught up 
in the day-to-day hustle of trying to succeed   in our job or our career or our business that we 
kind of just go from problem to problem yeah and   we don't take time to enjoy the victories in 
between so therefore it seems like there are sorry we were so rudely introducted by in 
sorry uh really interrupted not introducted   by uh my 17th scam call of the day 
gotta love these scammers they're   they're obviously feeling no stress right now 
yeah exactly but back to what i was saying is   you know is this going to matter in the long 
run yeah somebody once told me when i was young   is this going to matter next week next month or 
next year yeah you know and don't like for example   if you work for a corporation right and you're 
trying to do a great job but sometimes there's   people in roles that work with you or maybe 
they're impeding your ability to get your   work done or if it's a team type environment you 
know you can't take all that home with you and   put the weight of the company's problems on your 
shoulders because it's gonna seriously diminish   your sense of self-worth and your sense of 
accomplishment and what i was saying before   i was so rudely interrupted by the scammers 
um you have to learn to not just be waiting   and looking for the next problem yeah and that's a 
pitfall that a lot of us tend to fall into and um   it's not you know it's not a good thing because 
you you kind of are so busy worrying about   problems you're just like oh a couple little good 
things just happened here and i didn't even really   stop to enjoy them right yeah or my mother 
like my mother says stop to smell the roses   you know so it's really important to just 
try and slow down and i have a technique   that i kind of have created and i think it's my 
own i didn't get it from anywhere but i call it   you know 360 360 degrees introspection or 
reflection so i like to take a problem or a   situation and i like to picture myself rotating 
around that problem from a 360 degrees yeah i   think i've told you this before i don't know and 
basically i'm giving away all my trade secrets   here now she's going to be coining this as tiff 
and tech material yeah exactly um yeah like 360   degrees meaning i like to look at a situation from 
all angles and what are all the possible outcomes   you know good bad indifferent whether it 
be in a relationship our health business   friendships and you know the older 
you get you start to learn to kind of   listen more and talk less you 
know a wise man once told me   you have two ears in one mouth because you're 
supposed to listen twice as much as you talk   and it always stuck with me right and i you know 
i've been quite the talker a lot of my life and   not in a bad way just a very fun outgoing 
chatty guy yeah but as i've gotten older   i find myself wanting to kind of engage with an 
abundance of people and i keep my circles smaller   and i try to do more and work more with the people 
that i've really gotten to know and trust them   yeah quality over quantity almost yeah yeah 
i agree but back to the stress stuff i think   the best advice i give tiff and the best advice i 
can give anybody watching the channel is you know   no matter how bad it seems you know the sun is 
going to come up tomorrow yeah and if it doesn't   then you don't have to worry about it and 
the reality is you can't get today back so   just enjoy yourself and it's not going to 
be easy all the time it's not going to be   uh as i like to say rainbows and unicorns all the 
time but you just have to realize that you know   a friend of mine has a tattoo and i think 
it's a famous quote it says it too will   pass yeah and basically it's true you know when 
you're at the beginning of a problem or a storm   you think the storm will never end and then when 
the storm ends or you're in the middle of the   storm sometimes when it calms down you're like 
yeah this isn't as bad as i thought it was yeah   and i think too it's so important because it's 
something i'm learning is throughout life no   matter throughout any stage in life it's 
i used to be okay i used to always be like   okay if i get through this problem i'll be 
so happy or if i get through this next stage   i'll be so happy always thinking that i had 
to achieve this next thing to get happiness   right and i realized through being with 
you and through our conversations that it's   learning to handle stress and handle tough 
situations in a better way and be happy in the   moment still because there's any stress throughout 
your entire life 100 and you know i've noticed   with you sometimes you're lately not always but 
you've been bouncing from problem to problem   and not really just realizing that hey some really 
good stuff's happening here and i know there's   some great things going on in your life and uh you 
know me being one of them but you know it's uh you   know and we just have to all nobody's perfect we 
all got to slow down and we all deal with things   in a in a different way and yeah but you know um 
tiff likes to make me sound like i'm so smart but   a lot of it is just me uh being around the track 
more than one or two times over my course of my   life yeah yeah um that's true but the wisdom like 
i don't know the advice and insight in the way   you look at problems is that to me that is not an 
age thing it's just through having so many unique   experiences yeah maybe you're right i mean i've 
always been pretty i've never changed the way i've   looked at things yeah i've always had this 
kind of 360 kind of mentality um but yeah   tiff's trying not to kill us right now 
i know i'm trying to this could be the   last video ever posted so i hope you've 
all enjoyed tiffany tech and uh well   and on that note i just really thought it'd 
be good to get like while we're driving i i   was doing in the start of this vlog i was talking 
about how he's feeling stressed lately and stuff   like that i was like you know what i'm going 
to share with everyone my secret weapon and   you know just there might be a new channel 
starting soon called paul in grave no stop does   everyone like my sunburn i was out golfing today 
and uh if you're wondering it's not high blood   pressure it's uh it's a sunburn okay so i was able 
to successfully park paul's in getting dog food um   but i just wanted to wrap up this video i hope you 
found it insightful and valuable as well as far as   really how to break down a problem with stress 
and just navigate it and it's going to be okay   it's something that i feel like i'm going to save 
this video and watch it all the time when i am uh   having those moments because they definitely come 
and go and i think paul's right though just like   through different experiences and over time you 
just learn how to deal with stress or deal with   problems better and just go to look at it as a 
fun challenge so thank you all for watching if you   have any other questions for myself or paul around 
this subject though leave in the comments and i'll   make sure to pass on questions to him and answer 
them in the comments for you see you all soon you
