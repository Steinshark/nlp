ladies and gentlemen have you ever won a chess game in your life that's not the actual question there was more to it than that have you ever won a chess game in your life and then did a game review of that chess game and you won it like 95 96 97% for a brief moment you thought am I going to get banned are they going to think that I'm cheating like you played a brilliant game imagine playing a 99% accurate game and beating the best chess player in the world yes that happened today today was the grand finale of the first event of the Champions chess tour of 2024 and in the Grand Final we had Ali Resa fua versus Magnus Carlson which is basically like the modern day jokovic versus alcaras let's say all right we have the young guy Ali Resa fuja who once Magnus Carlson appointed as the heir to the throne Magnus said he would literally only play A world championship match if if Ali Resa fua qualified to play against him and now we're here you know we're here a few uh a few years later and every time these two play it's an absolute treat it is the young hungry lion who is now 20 21 years old uh versus uh Magnus Carlson right the incumbent the best player in the world 33 34 years old 33 and this is their match from today and this was a banger of a match I have six games to show you actually uh maybe I have more than that not going to ruin anything right now Magnus opened this match with G3 all right slightly disrespectful move but then it becomes a ready uh it's just it's not really disrespectful it's just you know it's allowing the opponent to basically take any bit of the center that he wants and when Ali Resa does this Magnus plays Knight F3 so now you know you can't put the E Pawn in the center they're playing rapid they're playing 10 second uh 10 minute with a 2C bonus time so we have a completely symmetrical position to begin with and this opening is known as a Neo GR greld black plays a Neo grunfeld clearly the only imbalances right here and frequently white will actually take on D5 and basically say look I'm playing white so it's an advantage for me to move first and actually symmetry benefits the player who is moving first because if you copycat logically if you copycat until the end the person that gives Checkmate will win right so but Magnus plays this in a very provocative way Magnus loves to give away this Pawn completely and take the center he has done this a lot so basically he says I get the center you get this stuff over here now let's play chess queen2 Ali Resa puts all his pawns forward on the queen side says let's go put all the pawns forward I'm ready I'm going to use the space behind the pawns get my pieces out Etc Magnus attacks the center of the board because that's what his position is equipped to do so he plays D5 very imbalanced game white clearly has a slight Advantage early but here he does something very weird he does not take the pawn back on D5 and try to put pressure he plays E5 so he's now down two pawns and alyza counterattacks his Knight and after Pawn takes he doesn't take the Knight because then he would lose a bishop he goes here and when the dust settles it is three pawns for a bishop Aliva has 1 two three four five six seven eight pawns Magnus has one two three four four five five pawns and oliv R has got a lot of Pawns here now the major question is are Ali resa's pawns assets or liabilities right 1 2 3 4 5 six all look pretty strong but these two are kind of standing alone is this Pawn for Magnus and as by the way how did this Pawn cross three pawns isn't that ridiculous looking how did the white Pawn sneak past three pawns like it doesn't even look real super weird position so Knight C6 Queen B6 Magnus grabs this Pawn but he loses that one all right so they trade B pawns Ali Resa now just puts pressure on the queen Side by taking one step back look at this say perfect example of life one step back to take two steps forward sometimes you got to go backwards in life to reset sometimes a failure or a struggle in life actually makes you a better person person the biggest meme some of you might have been through breakups right and this very common people go through breakups they go to the gym they start getting jacked in my case Lucy you know Lucy and I have been married now over two years we still um you know we still go to the gym together so it doesn't matter you can go to the gym by yourself you can go to the gym with your spouse you can go to the gym with your enemy all right you can go to the gym with your big inflatable balloon uh partner whatever whatever you guys are into Bishop takes King takes oliv Resa still has these very powerful pawns and here comes up with a very clever idea F6 giving Magnus this Pawn but that Knight is hanging but if Magnus comes back to defend the Knight Ali Resa takes the Rook lost in all of this chaos is that when Ali Reza made that Knight journey to D7 to C5 to B3 The Rook is hanging and Magnus decided that he was not going to play Rook A2 he was going to just do this take on E6 lose his Knight and take on D5 sacrificing his Rook completely completely just take it can't take it you take it you lose probably Rook D7 King h8 it's probably a mate here I probably take the rug play Queen F7 like you're going to lose not when The Rook takes back right so Rook A7 Rook D1 Rook E7 Ali Russ is defending himself Rook D7 Rook ff7 Unstoppable Force immovable object take take they trade King H6 but Magnus is just down upon Pawn he's down upon PA and while his King is a little bit you know while ala's King is a little bit weak look at this move A3 and you cannot take with the queen because you would lose the defense of the bishop and now now oliv has got a C Pawn wait a minute this is this is a really scary position check Queen C5 check King H5 and the only move here for Magnus that he had to find was G4 check he had to lose the pawn with check the idea of losing the pawn with check is whatever way you take there is a check waiting for you and then it's going to end in a Perpetual check but Magnus Carl blunders and loses he plays Queen D7 and resigns because there's no way to get to the king and there's no way to stop the pawn Magnus loses he loses game one with black and Ali Resa played this game 41 moves at 99% accuracy he played this opening he grabbed the pawn built up this big wall sacrificed his Knight I think this is probably all some sort of opening Theory and then they just played this very imbalanced game where black just said you know what I don't care that I'm down a piece I have an impregnable Fortress of Pawns what a game for mly Resa who takes down Magnus with a 99% win rate so he's up one to nothing now game two E4 Magnus goes for the true and tried the caroan and here alza makes a huge mistake he does not play the alien Gambit which you know he plays E5 and we enter the short variation Magnus plays A5 I know this move actually black is trying to just take some space it's just a sideline white plays A4 says you can't take space and uh then Magus tries to break out of the center with the move F6 Ali Resa says no thank you Knight E7 and now Ali Resa captures and puts the bishop on D3 and basically he's saying look Magnus you play this in a way that this is a backwards Pawn a backwards Pawn is a pawn whose neighbors have advanced in front of it and the square in front of it is controlled by the opponent so that pawn all the pawns Advanced nobody guards this right Pawn wise and that square is controlled but Magnus is going to very quickly develop his pieces and the position is clearly in the balance take take magus goes for an attack Ali Resa builds up some pressure against that E6 Pawn Magnus plays here and Ali Resa makes Magnus make a difficult decision do you play Queen F5 and just completely lose the pawn or do you do this not lose the pawn but we get a queen trade and now my Rook is pressuring all of your pawns normally Magnus is doing this to other people so now it's Rooks each and knights and the question is will Magnus be able to defend himself or will Ali Resa convert Knight C1 take a step back two steps forward boom boom right go forward counterplay being created Knight D3 very interesting idea in the interest of time he volunteers the damaging of his own structure take take because now Magnus has no counterplay which is not a sentence like anybody says ever now at this point what Magnus had to do if he wanted he could have brought his King slowly or he could have actually lashed out on the queen side which is a really tough move to make because then you make this a backwards Pawn you see it's not a backwards Pawn right now because it can move forward but now it can B5 right now Knight F6 goes back immediately alza jumps forward take take now Magnus tries to break out alza grabs the pawn Magnus creates counterplay by taking a PA back but now Knight C6 and these pawns are very very soft they're very soft Rook B7 he takes the pawn and Rook G7 so Oliver is still a pawn up probably it's still in the balance Magnus looking to defend himself nice little trick But Here Comes Ali Rus King B3 Rook e one oh nice trick if if you take the KN rookie for che King F5 though Rook H7 Ali resa is is still up upon PA he's he's been basically trying to break away from the magnus's defenses for a long time uhoh is there a mate Knight E4 check King G6 is there a mate King E8 Rook E7 ooh black is looking really stuck Rook D1 G4 and there go there goes alza Knight E3 oh my goodness you're attacking The Rook you're attacking the pawn what are you going to do he plays Rook B1 but now he's down two pawns he's down two pawns and his Knight is hanging he plays Knight C5 and that goes from bad to worse because kn3 wins the game this is hanging that's hanging there's nothing you can do oh my God in the span of like five moves there it went from bad to worse Magnus is down two to nothing he straight up just loses two games in a row Ali Resa just showed up and this man is ready to scrap so Magnus sits down for game three he's down two nothing right two nothing it's a best of four so it's two Z but if he wins two games we go to Armageddon okay play a London true and tried Magnus just meing around with all the openings London caroan all right Knight D2 Bishop D3 and we go for a Stonewall Bishop D3 is a slight move order trick and uh the point is that you don't develop your knight to F3 to try to play F4 this is actually in my D4 course but it's a very known you know I'm not saying Magnus studied the he might have I I don't know but um yeah it's in the D4 Dynamite course if you don't have it already you can get a free sample I won't tell you how cuz you'll figure it out if you actually want to F4 and now the idea is massive clamp on E5 so we have take take Knight F3 and a very important move is for white to play this move A3 because it stops anything from going to B4 Ali Resa plays A5 as you can see from the time spent by Magnus he is clearly uh very very much in control Rook C1 Rook C8 and now Magnus plays a crazy move um he plays G4 and the thing is he has to win right so he has to take risk so he plays G4 now some of you may be wondering is that a free Pawn yes kind of Knight takes G4 runs into a Greek gift Greek gift sacrifice of the bishop then Knight G5 and then Queen G4 but uh there is no attack here whatsoever Knight F5 Queen H3 and then I goes to H6 you're never checkmating black ever now would white play like King H1 and R probably but Knight takes G4 is just completely playable and I don't know what Magnus would have done by the way I mean would he have done this would he have tried to go for a position that looks you know more like this I I don't know but Ali Resa doesn't take Magnus has this effect on people right it's like two sets down jokovic literally by the way because he's down two games right it's literally two sets down Jo jokovic it's like you beat him twice and now you know this is The Knockout right here you take this Pawn you absorb the counterplay of Magnus you win the game but he doesn't instead he puts the Knight into the middle but now now Knight G5 and now it's not so simple and you know with black you might want to play a move like F5 here which by the way even that would work F5 is absolutely what Ali Resa should have played in this position because he would have just been Untouchable the pawns would have just completely locked in the Knight but he doesn't play F5 either he takes okay now the bishop is completely open take take right the more pieces you trade the less chance you have of losing now E5 he should probably break out or maybe he should go for a rook trade plays Knight C6 and now Magnus completely changes the tempo of the game and he plays a wild move here I mean Magnus has been telling us for a while he wants to attack he opened up his King he took some massive risk and then he goes [Music] here what I thought we were going over there and stuff nope nope I want to enter and I want to attack you on the queen side like this the position is still in the balance but now watch this boom and boom and we are in the black position and we are going to make things very annoying Rook Queen d8 Pawn takes the uh E5 and now this nice idea D4 point of D4 is to play Queen D5 right so it looks like I'm two pawns up but I've got Queen D5 ideas also this ridiculous move Knight H4 Apparently after Knight takes H4 Queen takes D4 anywhere the white king moves there is a fork for example King G2 there is this for example King H1 there is Queen D1 the King goes here and then there's this so there's a lot of problems here Magnus plays Rook D6 and that's the key idea the Knight takes and despite having the wide openen King he's up a pawn and not only is he up a pawn he's up 5 minutes and Ali Reza does his best but this is a completely horrendous Rook end game to try to hold against the best endgame player who has ever lived that's debatable but Rook D2 King E2 and you're just not going to survive there are way too many problems here the computer is able to like find different ways to hold it but yeah not when you play Magnus he gets your second Pawn he's just got two of those guys going and uh you just can't push you can't push cuz the Rook is defending everything King's going to come here it takes a few more moves the pawns make it all the way down the board and um in this position fua lost on time if he had played B7 you would have promoted to a queen and if Rook h8 you can win in a variety of ways you can stop the pawn by playing Rook C7 G2 and this that probably also wins but uh there's many ways to win so Magnus just comes back okay out of nowhere so there we we go there we go two to one which sets us up for this game Magnus down two sets E4 C5 Knight F3 D6 Magnus has to win this game D4 CD Knight D4 Knight F6 Knight C3 and like this H5 so idea here is black wants to play Bishop H6 he is creating this kind of weird anti- kingside Pawn storm setup and this is the kind of Sicilian Defense that you try to play If you're trying to beat somebody there's another idea here to play Knight takes D4 and then put the bishop out that way it's a very very weird setup you play like H5 and so on it's like a I don't know it's like a very weird Sicilian alza just you know plays in the center now we see the idea Bishop H6 take here here here Rook C8 everything is good and Magnus plays Queen A5 now a lot of this has actually been played before this kind of report Dragon named after the Hungarian now playing for Romanian grandmas uh rard report Queen C5 for rookie one and Magnus in this position after building up tension for a while BL something pretty bad he was very unhappy with himself he plays B5 and his idea was like you know to attack obviously but uh just this and one guy has just more attacking Firepower he has two Rooks in the game and Magnus only has one and so Magnus has to trade the Queens he plays A6 we settle on a few more exchanges but Ali Reza is not losing this position and remember that Magnus has to win this position which which funnily enough he actually gets some decent chances in this game like he advances his pawns and if we trade the Rooks and the king gets there you know like it's going to be but that doesn't happen F5 and uh after Bishop E2 Al resz offers a draw and the pawn can't actually be protected so Magnus in this position uh accepts the draw and Ali Resa wins he beats Magnus in the grand final of the chess Masters however it is a double elimination so this is magnus's first loss and Ali Resa emerged as the winner of the losers bracket so we go to a grand final reset which is new for chess we generally don't do double elimination so when the first time I heard of these terms like Grand Final reset I was like what is that I felt like a 80-year-old trying to use like an Android um no disrespect if you're watching this in your 70 or 80 it's just a stereotype about older folks I'm just I'm just listen there there're stereotypes about younger folks too there're stereotypes about you all sorts of people anyway point is um on a serious note like I have people come up to me on the street or like at Fan events or something like that folks are well into their 70s and 80s and it is pretty cool sometimes people comment like I'm 68 I haven't played chess for 50 years I got back into it because your videos chess is fascinating it's not like a lot of this other YouTube stuff which is like only for 12y olds and it's like memes and or boiling you up and stuff anyway with all that out of the way now that we had a little heart tohe heart there with the adults who are watching this video and not all the kids that are commenting and up voting all each other's comments to the Top This is the Grand Final reset it's a best of two if it's tied one to one we play Armageddon Magnus this time moves his Bishop a square further you will remember there was a game he moved the bishop over here now he moves the bishop one square further this is my favorite opening D5 five and here personally sometimes I like to take and damage the structure but I know that by playing this move black is saying I want that so go ahead so sometimes I don't even do it and what's interesting about this position it's a pretty it's a pretty excuse me it's a pretty similar structure right the major difference is that black hasn't played E6 and the bishop is on F4 so in this position the bishop is on F4 and black just played E6 right major difference that's it it's just the positioning of the bishop and here the bishop is a little bit more confrontational take take and oliv Resa plays H6 basically begging to be taken like go ahead Magnus give up your dark squared Bishop give me the bishop pair Magnus says no and by saying no the game just sort of becomes like an exchange caroan and you might be like what are you talking about well white doesn't have an E Pawn and black doesn't have a c Pawn so basically this position could have technically Arisen out of E4 C6 D4 d D5 take take C3 Knight C6 and something like Knight F3 Bishop F5 Bishop E2 Knight F6 Bishop G5 right like technically we could have got the exact same looking position look this is the position in the analysis board and this is the position right this is the exact same position it's just the last move is highlighted differently look at that is that magic that's magic dink dink wow so it's an exchange car Khan with slightly weird piece positioning and Ali Resa just goes you know what H5 I'm attacking and then a couple moves later he castles Queen side gloves are off it's a hockey fight I love that in hockey it's like a it's like such a gentlemanly thing they just they they they they decide before the fight that they're going to fight it's very rare they just like they're like are you trying to fight all right let's fight it's great I love it it's beautiful it's like you want to step outside except they're in the rink on the rink in their skates amazing now what are you do when the kings are on opposite sides easy boink boink B4 A4 you don't even think about it it just you got to send a warning shot you got to one pop to the stomach you know remember Charlie Hing used to punch each other in the leg or like the arm like ah same thing B4 A4 Ali Resa F6 G5 sending the warning shot right back to Magnus both guys attacking each other now clearly from a comfortability standpoint one guy has four minutes more than the other so Ali res is really struggling to figure out the best way to go forward with the attack the computer really liked him setting this up first and the computer actually really liked him playing E5 which is a weird move cuz if you play E5 you're not playing G5 so it wanted him to take a center based approach approach not approach so he doesn't do that he does this and then he starts building up like this but now now we have a problem and the problem is you know when the guy that's getting attacked on the side of a board plays a move on the side of the board where he's getting attacked say that five times fast yeah you know this is an issue cuz there's not enough you can play H4 you can sack the Knight but there's no mate I mean it looks like there's a mate there's no mate there's no mate Knight takes Pawn like there's no mate it looks like you're getting mate there's no mate you just can't there's no Checkmate so he has to go back and that's that's bad cuz now now now there is no more going forward there is no going forward Ali Resa tries to reroute and create a defense but now it is all Magnus it's like when you when you have an onslaught and then you stop them and then you fumble on the goal line like the Ravens A6 B6 Knight to E3 all the like 400 Baltimore fans that are watching this right now just lost their minds Queen D7 and Magnus ends this game like a man who knows that he's going to be in a Gotham YouTube video for the 800th time Magnus takes the pawn on D5 defending his Rook Ali resv plays Knight E4 cutting the communication between the Rooks if you take the Knight you're going to lose the Rook but also the Knight is hanging but the best way to end this game the best way to end this game is the sacrifice The Rook Rook takes B6 because you know you're going to lose it anyway so you take it with a check and the point is that now my Pawn is there that is the secret to attacking chess it's not just Pawn Pon p p pwn break everything down when white is going on this attack with A5 A6 he's preparing for the end game the options are black takes and opens the king or black does this and then Knight takes D5 Rook takes B6 F takes E4 he gets the KN back the pawn on A6 is walking up the board and uh it's bad news King A7 B5 Magnus locks it down and now it's just about can we get in Knight B4 Knight C6 takes he just keeps going Queen A5 and the Knight gets in and now we simplify down and it's just a winning end game Knights F5 D5 two connected pass pawns there we go now black could defend a little bit better look at that move though I mean dear Lord sacrificing The Rook with this coming e78 what a beautiful sacrifice you can't take it but the Rooks are too strong uh the pawns are too strong and uh he's just making a queen d8 and in this position fuja resigned so fuja from two nothing to winning that match to losing this first game in a complex back and forth battle now has to win with white if you're G to kill a game you got to play E4 E5 you got to play e45 I will remind you in this game he played the Caro Khan and in this game he played the Sicilian but in both of those games he needed to win he wanted to bounce back very quickly he didn't want to stabilize and now he wanted to win with the Sicilian how are you going to get beat Magnus Carlson in a symmetrical Kings Pawn game well we go for an Italian then we play a provocative Italian with Bishop G5 this is called a provocative Italian because because he gets in your face and says hey what are you doing H6 Bishop to H4 Bishop E7 it's provocative because you're supposed to go G5 that's what you're supposed to do Magnus says you know I'm not doing all that like that's the point he wants me to play his I'm not going to play his game D6 you want space you're not getting space beat me castles castles G6 the idea of G6 is to put the Rook there and to reroute the bishop to G7 cuz it's kind of a clown here it's not doing anything and it's a close position so that's exactly what Magnus does all right he plays G6 he plays rookie 8 plays Bishop F Bishop he has time he has time he has a little bit of downtime on vacation he fixes up a few things around the house here comes H fuia now the top engine move here is still to kick out the bishop Max is like no I'm not going to do I'm not going to weaken my king C3 now I'm going to weaken my king take take now I'm ready because if this now I take the bishop I come here and I can play a five of four and and yeah you're never you're never getting out so fuja now has to take and white is slightly better absolutely white is slightly better but Rook B8 Black's position is quite easy to play Queen C2 Magnus puts the on F4 with a simple idea if takes actually black could take with either you could maybe try to create an attack or you can just open up the bishop which I got to tell you I mean dear Lord that looks powerful I mean my God so D4 Queen F6 take take Knight D2 Queen E6 B3 Magnus brings the bishop back around Fu's time is ticking but he plays Knight C4 and now it's a question of wait a minute why did Magnus play like what about his pawns he's going to lose he's going to lose gives up the pawn wow Ali res has made a comeback it's unbelievable what a match he's going to win this game and force an Armageddon G4 though Magnus says not so fast I'm creating counterplay if you take I have mating ideas H4 it's a weird move but basically I'm just not opening the G file Knight H5 the idea of Knight H5 is to mummify your bishop and play on this diagonal so alir has to play King H1 but now Magnus plays Queen F6 he's threatening the F2 Pawn he's threatening the pawn on H4 so we go here we give up our Bishop but we protect our King now Magnus plays Queen F2 oh my goodness you can take and take but you can't protect the rook and the pawn at the same time now the best move in this position is to put the Rook on the file and play B4 but Ala plays this with a very simple idea overprotect your Pawn to enable Knight C6 now the most natural move here is Bishop G3 then Knight C6 then Rook b h that would be nice then then Rook B6 Knight B4 maybe bishop H4 and white just pushes and hopes for the best but here Magnus plays this move F5 down a pawn already he gives up another one because he just wants the E Pawn time is of the essence and he needs fua to in his mind reprogram now fuja thinks he's thinking he's thinking he can take this Pawn he can take this Pawn or keep begin pushing B4 plays B4 but now Rook d8 Magnus doesn't even take he's leaving the pawn here or maybe he's going to push it in like this now o Resa takes and apparently what you had to do when you had to play this first to prevent the Rooks infiltration that's what you needed to play Magnus making it really difficult Rook D6 Ali res plays B5 but now the pawn takes it didn't matter you could have taken I still would have made a pass Pawn so now I took uhoh uhoh and here something insane happens Ali RZA in this position can take a pawn with check but why would you take if the king is getting closer well then after Rook E4 if black plays Rook D2 you have Rook F1 and the king is sort of stuck King's like out in the open you say well Levy that's easy just King H7 I understand Rook D2 all of this I still play Rook F1 but what about E2 yeah but then I can take the bishop and if you take me like if you play something like Rook f8 I have this point is the king is gone but Ali Reza didn't quite get that detail and he just went here right away but here's the problem with the King here where it's standing right now on G8 when The Rook goes to f8 it's protected so Rook D2 Rook F1 Rook f8 you lose because if you take now King H7 and you're not back in time E2 the major difference was that if instead of there you played Rook takes G4 check if in this position you went here the king deflected somewhere it didn't want to be it either went here into the line of F1 or here where it did not defend the Rook King h8 Rook E4 Rook D2 Rook F1 Rook f8 the king is not defending the Rook so you have this but what happens in the game is not that what happens in the game is this and now you are defended and fuja loses because Rook F2 Rook F2 and the queen is coming on the next move and the game is over fuja puts up a massive fight against Magnus even beating him with a 99% accuracy but a massive comeback two sets down Magnus Carlson comes back and wins it in the Grand Final reset listen it's always fun six games between these two oh my goodness just an absolute blast five decisive games out of six what more can you ask for that's all I have for you today get out of here
