So i'm going to talk about one of my areas of research which is and banking fraud and the technology, that's used to prevent it But, also Understanding how it actually happens because unless you understand that it's not going to be possible to come up with techniques that will actually Prevent it effectively probably start, by looking at how You the most common are more sophisticated frauds happen, and that will help us understand about, why The, banks designed the defenses the way that they, do and then, we can, maybe look a bit more about how The defenses actually work in a bit more detail The a problematic situation for bank customers is something called the the man-in-the-browser attack so it's not very good name it comes from Terminology in banking or computer security more broadly called man-in-the-middle and this is where the adversary is? somewhere between the person Who is legitimately doing the transaction, and then the person who's receiving the transaction so in this case the bank But the reasons called man-in-the-browser rather than man-in-the-middle is it's not like the adversary's just out on the network somewhere The adversary has actually put software onto the victims computer through malware or however And then that malware is interfering with what the person sees if we think about this is the? Victims, web browser, you'd put in the account number you Won't send money to you put in the amount and then you'd put in a one-time password how, about used to work, is that banks would send a sheet of paper with lots of passwords that people taped in No, these people have got mobile phones but, they type in a one thing, password this looks kind of secure but the problem Is that if there is a man in the browser Involved this is not actually the real banking website this is just a peek screen That is set up? By the malware what's really happening Is that the criminal is booting in the criminals account number and A much larger about and this is a detail that is being? Sent to the bank the bank will only accept the transaction if the one-time password is correct That's fine because the customer is going to put in the one-time Password here the malware will receive it and then the one tank password in there and then the bank will get the transaction But the bank will see the criminals transaction not the one that the customer actually intended so the customer is logged on to online banking and The, details that the tape in are or something like ping, they'll just email, where Gas bill but actually there could be transferring 100,000 to the criminals account, and because the Transaction is actually coming from The, victims, own computer and is coming from their own web browser i hope yet a hike Web browser from the bank's perspective that's perfectly legitimate so this was a big problem for the banking industry in lots of countries so the banks in Most of europe have now moved over to Not only having a one-time, password but, making that one-time Password linked to the transaction so it's not just i think Ii think, who someone is it's a think eating transaction it's called transaction authentication, from my experience we've been using These little devices at home for a long time i know, you've brought a, few, along, yeah although, any? Place is still using this straight one-time Password and system in the world so in general Even though, america is quite sophisticated most circumstances for banking and banking security they're quite behind so In america is actually quite unusual to do online banking for moving money around stop Checks are still being used even though in most of europe they're gone and in the uk the banks are trying to get rid of? them so The in general don't really have any particularly sophisticated banking security But in some ways, that's actually better for the customer Because the banking laws in the us are very much consumer focused so essentially if anything goes wrong The, bank will give your money back even If the bank believes that you've acted negligently, you've done something that, no one could reasonably expect it to do they're Still legally obliged to give most of your money money back and in practice they're actually give all of your money back The europe and the uk does have better banking technology But when it goes wrong often the customer actually pays the cost so one of the other things i've been doing is talking to regulators and Telling them that when they're looking at banking technology And when that banking technology is being used to shift the cost of fraud to the customer they should look to
see if the Security technology is actually working properly And whether it's reasonable to meet customers lie or for fraud when they, don't really have any choice about how the
system works or how it's designed certainly in europe the more simplistic systems are either gone or they're going to be Eliminated because there's a new european law? Called the payment services directive - which actually mandates the more secure transaction authentication However it like most laws doesn't actually see the technical details about, how Things are going to work, and that's probably Good, because politicians are not very good in developing technology it just says what What criteria the system should meet and so there's a. Huge diversity Across all of europe, and even within countries has to have these technologies work and in terms of cryptography They're all basically okay, they, may not use the most modern of cryptography so for example Banking systems often use there's the data encryption standard rather than the more modern aes encryption Block, cipher but that's essentially irrelevant for most purposes Where they do vary a lot is in the way that they work and the way That people interact with them and that actually causes a, huge difference in terms of their security because if someone is confused about how They work Then they could be quite easily tricked into doing something wrong and we've seen that criminals actually are doing that so one traditional trick by criminals is Assuming the technology, works what they will see is they'll take, over your, web browser and they know, tell you Some story and story normally goes along the lines off there's been Some error money has appeared in your account and your account Is going to be locked until you send this money back to The legitimate order and if you log on to your online banking and look at your statement then This, fake, transaction will be there your balance will be far larger than it normally will be and There will be instructions about transferring, this money back to the right person but actually That's all fake, the money has not appeared in your account And the so-called legitimate owner of the money is actually the criminals accountant so you use one of these devices to Authorize a transaction to move this money but actually, you're sending Your, own money to the criminals and it could be a long time before you notice that this has been going on And that sort of? Scam works because people were too distracted By trying to make the technology work in any way whatsoever that they? Don't actually have the time to think about whether they really should be using this Technology, to do that transaction so essentially the more obvious and the easier you, make the technology the less likely Is that criminals are going to be able to get people to act and in secure ways it seems to me that's kind of a Phishing attack mixed with mal water so what's going, on with the devices themselves, why, have they, had to resort to that yeah so there's three broad categories so there's the Devices that you put your card into it like this one these are very common in the uk this isn't a Uk, device this is from the netherlands it's got a Keypads it's got a few buttons and it got like hard That goes into it really the Device is not doing very much in this case all the work is actually being done by the card and that's, why People can actually, use someone else's device In the uk even a device from a different bank and it will still work provided. They're, using their card But because it's using a card it's got some limitations so the first one is going to be actually quite big and chunky because it's got to be large enough to have batteries that parish the card and It's got to be large enough to physically have the card inside it and that's one reason they're Unpopular so the alternative is device like this so this is still got a Keypad, it's much smaller much thinner smaller batteries and it can Do that because there's no card at least. Be put into it some customers like this but the downside Is that this device is no linked to you so this is the one that's linked to your account so it's not like You can, borrow more someone else's device it's not like you can have One device home and when the vase of work let You can, with the card reader devices like, these but with, both of these devices there's got to be some way for linking the password that it generates to the transaction details and the way that this works is you type in Something, like either the account number you're sending the money to or the last four digits of the account. You're sending the money to And that's a bit i mean inconvenient particularly if you have to do it a lot so that's, why There's other, devices this has a little camera on the back you use that camera to scan a 2d barcode That the bank shows. You, and that's much much easier for customers to use and It means that you're Not just authorizing the last four digits of the account, number the bank can actually send a lot, more details about the transaction so Firstly, that reduces the amount of effort the customer needs to go to because they just scanned something rather and type something and also it Gives them, more details which hopefully gives them a, better chance at trying to spot whether there's one of these scams at work Then we've got yet another one this one also has a pin with all these devices you, want to check firstly whether the transaction has been authorized but, also whether the right customer is doing the transaction, and the traditional way to, do that is Two factors so something the customer has and something they know so for the card reader devices like this one it's do they actually have the card and Do they know the pin it's a four digit pin this is got a four digit pin as Well this you can have a pin this one doesn't but the way that the banks use that is that they, ask The customer to enter a password into the website but the password has got to be much longer than a four digit pin Because when you're typing a? Password into a website a criminal can tried lots and lots and lots of passwords but with all of these devices Where you type a pin into it the device itself actually Checks, that the pin has not been entered too many times so in the case of the card reader card has got a Your counter on it and then once that goes about three the card locks out and it's similar with These two devices once the pen has been entered too many times and these devices They, lock and you got to talk to the bank to unlock them, again The topic botnet, was the first one or one of the first at least Introducing the domain generation algorithms in order to find the domain, where they would have found a command control server in a dynamic Away, during the infection but, what has been done by researchers in 2009
