hey everyone welcome back to a new episode of tech in turn so today we're going to be talking about what are we talking about today we are talking about how to survive waterloo engineering cs math blah blah blah whatever you want to call it i want you to take away the things it took me five years to understand and five years to realize these are not just like some stupid things i came up with just to make a video out of apply this stuff to your life watch this video apply to your life tell your friends if you get anything out of it i don't care don't tell your friends i'm not even trying to like self promote here don't tell your friends if you don't get any value out of this so if you're going in a first year um i think you need to know a little bit first about the different residences i could probably do an entire episode about this and i probably will uh but what i'll say is i was in uwp and i hated it i hated it so much i found it was really difficult to meet people you know in those sweet styles i know mkb is a sweet style uh clv which is a nightmare if you're in first year and uwp all of them are sweet style i would really recommend against that in first year um i know that rev can be a bit of a party one so i would probably recommend against that too just because like you're gonna have a lot of studying to do and why i have the temptation so i guess that leaves v1 left um and i think there's a new one on campus that i think is next to uwp that was in construction when i was in school uh i've heard it's a it's a good option too so i would consider those two if you do get put in uwp if you do get put in rev you know you're gonna be fine uwp was fine for me i ended up meeting people but you know it did take a little bit of time i didn't meet anyone my first semester there so in short i would say go to something like v1 go to rev you'll be fine so the number one advice i can give you for doing cs or engineering at waterloo start assignments the day they come out that's it it's that simple when i was in first year when i was doing those cs assignments they're so big you know you start them a few days before they're due and the deadlines at like 6 p.m you're racing up till 6 p.m you're like you're sitting in front of the computer typing like a madman trying to get any solution to work submitting your code seeing if it works you know panicking it didn't work pull it back down you know slam out some more code submit it again doesn't work like that is the stress that i had through all of my first term and i kept doing really poorly on assignments and it was because i kept living from assignment to assignment so it would be i'd finish one assignment i finished at 6 p.m and i'd go oh finally i'm done now i need a break and i would break for you know a few days and then it would be the next thing on the next assignment i kept thinking how is it possible for this to happen so i came up with this idea what if i shift this entire schedule three days over so instead of starting the assignment three days after it comes out and racing up till the end i start it right when it comes out and finish three days before it's due i was like it can't be that simple right it is that simple that's exactly what happened and sometimes you might not finish three days before but you still have that time to seek out help from tas from friends whatever it may be you still have those three days as buffer and what you're going to find is that's completely invaluable start it the night it comes out if it comes out at 9 00 pm don't say uh start in the morning start at 9 00 pm always start an assignment the minute it comes out if you can but definitely the day it comes out so one thing took me a really long time at waterloo to catch on to was to do assignments alone when you can so they say this from the very beginning but uh you kind of don't believe that it's possible to do the assignments alone i felt i felt like that for me every time i went to a course it was basically like just jumping between assignments just trying to somehow scrape by the right answers just to like ward off that danger for that week you know that's what i felt like and you're really trying to get the answers instead of trying to learn if you can do assignments alone you'll be much better off and then once you've hit a roadblock that's when you seek help that's when you seek tas that's when you you know ask friends uh not for solutions but you know just discuss things another piece of advice you know i'd say don't let a bad mark get you down what i'm gonna say is a lot of courses are known for trying to weed out first years and cs waterloo edge like it's it's no different they're no exception they try to weed you out so they're gonna try and do is push you quite a lot and what you're gonna find is that your midterms um your class might do so bad they might even fail the midterm the average on the midterm might be like 45. it may be like 55 you know maybe 60 if it's a good year and it's going to really get you down especially if you're at waterloo you're probably a smart person you probably got 90s in high school now you come to a school and the average is 45 like how do you survive you know i remember this one time in particular i was out with friends i had just received a grade and i'm one of those people that can that the second the grade comes out i have to look i was out with friends we were having a few drinks i checked my phone and i i got 35 my stomach just completely dropped and i thought oh i'm not smart enough to be here i'm gonna fail and i was just so upset i i had to get up and just go straight home and that's the way you're gonna feel if you let if you think every time you get a bad grade that you're just not smart enough that's what's going to happen to you and a lot of people that can snowball if you just seclude yourself if you get down from these bad grades you'll snowball into getting more bad grades so what i have to say is learn from your mistakes you know if you got a bad grade on something review it find out why maybe you can argue for some marks a lot of the time you can i left the window open again rookie um and i've i felt like there's no way that we're all going to survive this course and you know we did like if the midterms really hard they usually make the final easier um if you do really poorly on one assignment it's not that big of a deal another thing and this is really important never and i'm talking never come into contact with i think they call it policy 71 that's the academic integrity stuff never cheat never copy someone's code never look at someone's solution i know it's going to be tempting and it's going to be really tempting i'm i'm promising you that but they specifically set up the assignments to be worth 10 percent of your grade each assignment is going to be worth like two percent of your grade really two percent of your grade is nothing and what's going to happen is you're going to be tempted because things are going to be really tough you'll want to look at solutions you'll want to get help you don't want to sacrifice that 2 what's going to happen is you'll look at a friend's code you'll take it you'll change the variable names because you'll think that's enough and it won't be enough and what'll happen is they'll slap you with a five percent penalty on your entire grade and you'll fail the assignment so it's a seven percent penalty on your final grade that seven percent is worth almost as much as the assignments in total i did have friends that did get slammed by it and you know sometimes it it's the difference between passing and failing of course last but not least i've got some pretty basic advice and this is just stay healthy join an extracurricular you know maybe go to the gyms there you know stay healthy stay fit get active maybe play some sports uh go for walks i don't know but do something that's outside maybe do something that gets your heart rate up you know that's healthy for you and don't just lock yourself in a room and you know let waterloo get you down because it does it for a lot of people especially in the winter when you can't really go outside but you can still go to the gyms you can still play basketball or something you have to get out of your your house or i'm telling you you'll go crazy sometimes when you're stuck on a massive problem something really hard if you get up you go for a walk you meet some friends what'll happen is halfway through that you know activity you'll get this epiphany and you'll go oh that's what it was that's the solution you know your brain works on these things in the back of your mind while you're doing other stuff so and that is really going to do wonders for your mental health because that's a big concern at waterloo so that's kind of all the advice i have and it's not groundbreaking advice but it's seriously stuff that people take for granted i've gotten a lot of feedback on the last waterloo video i did so that's why i'm making this one and if you guys are enjoying the waterloo content please shoot me a message let me know i'd be happy to continue making more of it because waterloo was a big part of my life uh thank you guys so much for watching this episode of tech in turn and i will see you next week
