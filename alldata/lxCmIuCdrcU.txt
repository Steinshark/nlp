when is it too late to switch careers and I know some of you are coming on here thinking she's going to start this video or say in this video that it is never too late to switch careers you can do it at any point and that is just we can beep out all the words here which honestly you're not going to get in this video you will not get that there is never a wrong time to switch careers because the reality is there is wrong times to switch careers and there is a point where maybe it is too late to switch into a different career in this video I'm going to explain to you really how to navigate switching careers what to look for and expect and also to when is it too late when is it the wrong time to maybe switch careers before we get into it though make sure to hit that subscribe button for more Tech coding career all that good stuff related content leave down in the comments any questions feedback comments in the comments anything that comes to mind I guess I'm responding to all your comments I love you all all right enough of that let's get into it [Music] there are three main things that people face when they are even considering getting into Tech or really any other industry or if you're already working in Tech may be moving into a completely different role these things can you guess what they are the first one being time and money there's no surprise here as we get older a lot of times it means more responsibilities which means less time towards learning and upskilling also too if you are thinking about switching into a completely different role or career what also might happen is you need to put money towards that time of learning so it could be going to a boot camp taking a certification and that time kind of equates to money in the sense that more time you're putting towards that it's more money because even if you're not directly paying out of pocket you could be doing something else so that's a big first pillar the second thing people face is agism okay you can make the time you do have the money you can switch into this career but what is it going to look like are you going to face a bunch of people saying oh you're too too old to work in this industry you're working with a bunch of 20year olds and you're you know further along in your your career Journey what does that look like and is that going to be enjoyable and the third being are you going to be in demand you are switching into this career it's a risk are you going to be in demand what ha I mean with AI especially nowadays it seems as though one job one day is in demand and the next day it's gone what does that look like with you putting all your energy and resources towards this and will it pay off these three pillars we are going to dive into and really talk about if it is actually worth it for you to switch careers now something that really doesn't help with agism in the world of tech and especially when it comes to switching careers starting your own business is that we really celebrate young Founders I mean think Mark Zuckerberg with oh he created this great idea of Facebook or helped create it in college and it happened so young and you're billionaires by the time you're 30 and if you're not a billionaire by your 30 why even try that's kind of the mentality that the media puts on us and it's hard to not get sucked into that a really good example though and I actually didn't know this was Jeff Bezos do you know how old he was when he started Amazon he was 30 now that's still very young I'm not saying otherwise but imagine when you're 30 years old or being 30 years old having a quite a good career on Wall Street and a lot of connections and you know you're in a good Groove you're married completely switching into something else taking the risk to start your own business I mean thank goodness he did look look what it is today but 30 isn't young 30 isn't what the media in the sense that what the media celebrates to be young meaning they want people who are 19 20 21 founding their own businesses and that goes the same for when is it too late to switch into your careers not saying that it's 30 or you're done but rather look at it as there have been so many success stories of people who have completely done 180s into different careers at a later stage in life than when they are in their early 20s now on the flip side there's a lot of people who have made or tried to make this switch and failed what makes it that some people can succeed into making these career switches and some people can't let's dive into that the first thing is you need to have supportive Community around you and this doesn't have to be a community of 10 or 20 people when I say community I mean people that you interact with on a daily or weekly basis they need to really support you and believe in what you're doing well let me rephrase that they don't even need to believe in you are doing but they need to at least encourage you for example imagine if Jeff Bezos who was married at the time that he started Amazon imagine if his wife at the time McKenzie she was super miserable saying to him you can't start this don't do this I mean he probably after a while would have just quit because even though Amazon feels like an overnight success it wasn't and he needed his partner to be there supporting him every step that is the same for you I mean whether it's starting a business or switching into careers you need to ensure that the people you are surrounded with really support you because there are going to be times where it feels like this will never happen like you really want to give up and if you have a partner friend whatever the case is that is not supporting you that you interact with on a daily basis it's going to make it very difficult for you to successfully make that transition another being you really need to differentiate between motivation and discipline we've spoken about this in a few other videos but if you are purely going on you are motivated to make this career switch and transition into a high paying engineering role from being something completely different if you're solely focusing on motivation for that you are going to fail motivation isn't enough you need to be disciplined because more often than not after you start this journey there are going to be so many days that you don't want to continue and the only thing that will keep on pushing you forward is through discipline sticking to the schedule you have created uh learning a little bit every day every second day whatever that schedule looks like but not making excuses the other thing you will have to do when you going through this career change or Evolution if you will is you need to ensure you are networking and I know this is a hard thing for many people to do but you need to be putting yourself out there connecting with others more importantly connecting with others that have had or gone through similar experiences as you they might have been into or gone through uh role changes completely different than what you are about to do but still having gone through that experience that you can relate to them and they can relate to you give you advice and guidance as to what to expect as you get older there are some things in life that get a lot easier on the flip side there are things that get a lot harder switching careers is one of those however I do really believe that now is probably the easiest time to switch careers than it's ever been before thanks to having so many great resources online and the ability to learn through free resources online that being said though it doesn't make it completely walk in the park it is difficult imagine you are in your late 30s 40s 50s even or Beyond and you want to switch careers we have seen this done over and over again but you need to have that perseverance to do so because many factors might come at play one being you might even have to be set back from your compensation to begin with in order to really be move forward beyond what you are currently making and you need to be in a situation where you have saved up for that or you're comfortable with taking that risk I thought I would share though a personal story about this as I was someone who wasn't I I switched careers but it wasn't necessarily experiencing agism because I did so in my 20s early 20s but what I did experience was my first job my boss was actually younger than me just by about 2 years so it really wasn't a big difference but at the time it felt like such a big difference and I remember being like this is so embarrassing what am I doing he is younger than me and then I realized who cares like really who cares the fact that I am here and going after what I want should be commending myself but it was definitely something that you have to get used to at first is understanding and I'm sure throughout my career because I'm someone who likes to change and evolve I hope I have bosses younger than me in the sense there's so much you can still learn from people who are younger than you that don't let just like we are fearful of having agism put on us maybe switching careers at a later point in life don't then in turn put that agism on someone who is younger than you who might be in a higher or more senior role than you that's just something to really think about I think we don't realize that maybe we sometimes are the ones putting back that agism on others as well agism is real it happens every day no one is saying otherwise but try and look at it from their point of view as well and see what that uncovers uh but sometimes it's just it's tough I never want though that to be a reason you don't go after what you want I think at the end of the day the purpose and I hope what you take away from this video is that it is going to get harder to switch roles as you get older but it's not impossible I mean to certain degrees don't try and become a rocket scientist you know in your 50s it might require going back to school for a long time but who knows you never know anything is possible what I'm saying though is evolution is a good thing evolving into other roles is a really big positive especially in today's day and age the skills you can take from one rule will really apply into other areas or other roles more than you even realize that's what I've experienced anyways curious to hear have you always been on the straight and narrow career path have you had some pivots if you have leave in the comments I mean for myself I went from modeling fashion uh graphic design front-end development backend development to developer relations it's been a wild ride and everything has been threaded throughout that though which is really interesting there's always been this kind of underlying consistency of bringing these experiences with me as I go and that's something that you can do as well all right I hope you enjoyed this video this pep talk about why you should just go after what you want and I will see you all soon thanks everyone [Music]
