tobacco baby with laser eyes lady with laser eyes Exxon Mobil with laser eyes these are the most evil businesses in the world according to 24 year old capitalist Jake Tran he's a YouTuber pumping out content that I can only describe as horror movies but for business people and that's why of course I love watching them I mean who wouldn't like these videos wow this is insanely evil wow this dude is evil this is absolutely evil wow this is pure evil look I know what you're thinking based on those titles it's hard to choose but the reason we're here today is because buried beneath all this talk of evil businesses and evil people I noticed Jake Tran has his own weird little evil scheme going on which I first noticed watching one of his videos and I can't remember which one it was it was either like we're all gonna starve or oh great we're all gonna die something like that and what I noticed is that Jake makes these videos exposing scams but then often uses the same tactics of the scam to then pitch you like a sponsor that's in the same same Lane like for example he'll tell you that lotteries are predatory lotteries are predatory they play on our psychology to suck a strike of our hard-earned money but then in that same video he'll sell you a quote no lose lottery play the no lose Lottery by pausing the video and clicking the link below and it's not just that it seems like he hand-picks these sponsors for the videos because he also said uh crypto trading Bots are a scam and often a way to get people to believe there's a free money machine back in The Wolf of Wall Street days you would just shut penny stocks down people's throats and take a giant commission a few years back it might have been selling a stock trading box or a Forex Trading Bots that supposedly makes you money while you sleep but today we have something even better even more tempting a crypto trading box now right after learning that crypto trading Bots are the new tempting way to get people to give you their money guess what Jake Tran advertises and the product itself is actually legit you can set up your own custom bots based on your parameters deploy them to start training automatically with your money see the trades come in and would draw all your money like it's almost breathtaking isn't it like to see someone denounce a scam and then in the same breath be like you know it's not a scam the same thing now of course in Jake's defense he'd say that pionex which is the trading bot is legit because he tried them himself and he made money I've actually set up what's called their grid trading bot 11 days ago give it one thousand dollars to trade with and I'm already up three percent on it nothing crazy but also pretty good for just 11 days now the only problem with this argument is that Jake says he tried the product but he messed it up because the what he's talking about making him three percent that trading bot actually never traded a single transaction it says this on his screen there are zero transactions in these 11 days he shows meaning that what he thought was a three percent gain from a trading bot was likely just Bitcoin going up by three percent in 11 days but it gets so much worse our next video I want to show you is called so it's a Ponzi scheme but with crypto where he talks about Africa but then at the end of the video a appears to make a sales pitch kind of for a Ponte scheme and the hottest niche in crypto right now is flipping nfts where people are making life-changing money just from getting on an nft hype early on buying and then selling soon after for insane amounts of money and one way to do it is to look at what crypto whales are buying crypto whales are influential people who have a ton of crypto so if you buy an nft project others tend to follow pushing the price up the hard part is catching on to these crypto whale hype trains early on so you're not left holding the bag wait a second I want to make sure I have this right I'm supposed to be able to make life-changing profits by catching a hype train early but I have to make sure I'm not the one left holding the bag hmm this sounds a lot like a Ponzi scheme so new role here on coffee Zilla anyone who says the hottest niche in crypto right now is X is evil they're trying to scam you I mean literally he's promoting basically what he just announced it's so insane now to be fair to Jake I don't think this nft project which was called meta monks ever launched I think it got scrapped because they didn't build enough hype instead less than a month after it a new video came out from Jake Tran called the evil business of nfts and this is where things get even more bizarre in the weird world of nfts there is something Sinners they're going on where criminals are making off with Millions with what's called a rug pole okay I'm pretty sure you guys know where this is going Jake Tran is telling us how evil and profitable nft rug pulls are I wonder who the sponsor is so if people want to get into flipping like you said to start out are there any projects that you're looking into right now that you see potential in yeah and one thing I want to make clear when you're new you need to spend a little more time to really try to understand that this team is authentic that care they actually want to build something because it's really hard to differentiate who is using these buzzwords to manipulate you and who actually has good intentions and wants to build something for the long run and so I guess I'll use the project that we're advising for as the example the cunning wolf Society I love the shamelessness the guy you're hearing from right now by the way is Brett he's the expert in rug pool supposedly teaching us how to avoid scams and at the end of this video he's like yeah you got to be careful because people will just say anything to take your money you never know who to trust oh by the way buy our nft project the cunning wolves Society you could not have picked a less trustworthy names you might as well have named it the sneaky snakes or rugbull rabbits I mean who buys into projects like this like Hey we're the cunning wolves our defining traits are that we're devious and predatory now surprisingly unlike the last time which didn't really work out for Jake this time the project that they're supposedly advising on sold very well over a million dollars and there's a lot to this because they ended up using a lot of the same tactics they describe as red flags earlier in the video to sell this project and now that investors are down 80 percent you have to wonder who's left holding the bag but probably my favorite part of this whole thing comes right at the end because like I said earlier Brett and Jake are trying to push this idea of like flipping nfts in the form of this cunning wolf Society but in this exact video Brett the rug pull expert tells us that the real money isn't even in flipping nfts it's in selling to the people who are flipping nfts I'm making a lot of money flipping nfts you realize oh my God the project that I'm buying these nfts is from are making five percent of every single transaction it's like that's where the real money's at wait wait wait you just told us to flip your nft and then told us that the real money isn't in flipping nfts it's in transaction fees which by the way what are the transaction fees for the cunning wolf Society let's just scroll down this page real quick oh it's five percent right of course it is isn't it amazing that they like tell you how it works and then do the exact thing I mean it's so Shameless that it almost pisses me off like Jake Tran actually makes pretty good content when he's not selling these get rich quick schemes so I felt like it needed to be called out and I also feel like you the audience need to be aware that just because someone is calling out scams doesn't instantly make them trustworthy I feel like a lot of people just drop their guard and just believe the next words out of someone's mouth just because they were the guy who caught out a scam anyways with all that said I guess I just want to wrap this video up by telling you guys about the new hottest niche in crypto right now
