i caught one of the dumbest scams ever and no no no hold your applause it didn't exactly take a genius to figure out they advertise a 383 000 return per year they call themselves seifu as in your money is safe and if you ask how fu on their website they say if you deposit a thousand dollars you could earn 3.8 million dollars by the end of the year that is if everything goes according to plan anyways normally i would kind of avoid talking about stuff like this because this kind of scheme is beneath most people's iq but that all changed for a couple of reasons one the project has a market cap of 100 million dollars so there are a lot of investors two i talked to one of these investors who i first knew through safe moon and now he works as an admin for safe foo and when talking to him he said something that concerned me and convinced me that i needed to investigate this see if you could spot it uh can i ask um are you planning on making a uh a video because like i would appreciate it if you would like let it play out what if play letting it play out is everyone getting rocked what do you think about that that would be pretty damn unfortunate yeah and i totally agree with that but that's not the the plan here now this is the mother of all red flags let it play out sort of the rallying cry for theranos nicola and every scammer ever and this is what changed my casual interest in this ponzi coin into a full-blown investigation so without further ado let's investigate seifu to understand seifu you first must understand the founder he's a man named brian legend which sort of sounds like the name of a bad wrestlemania villain but is actually brian's second last name he changed it after being accused of multiple scams the most notable ones fitrova tags exchange and clever defy in each case he's managed to convince people to give him lots of money many people lose their money and brian scurries off to his next project the most recent being seifu now brian is a humble man so he doesn't like the term serial scammer and much prefers low-key titles like legend visionary entrepreneur influencer and investor and he says his accusers of the past are misunderstanding him those weren't rug pulls they were just failed businesses so there's a difference between a rugball which is a scam and a failed business they're just two separate things now as you hear brian almost sounds credible when you first hear him he sounds sheepish about the fact that oh i just i didn't know a lot about business i didn't have the business acumen for this so that didn't work out unfortunately um yeah it just failed miserably because i didn't have the the business acumen and to be able to deal with the fad that was in place he emphasizes look i'm transparent about my past i don't have anything to hide i'm always transparent and i'm happy to answer any question like it's no secret right to what happened so i'm yeah i'm happy to be public about it that's that's fine this is why it was strange when i asked him for an interview he said he only would under the condition that we not talk about his failed projects and had to instead only talk about seifu i thought this was strange so i dug deeper and it turns out his projects did not simply fail because he was a bad businessman but instead they were rug pulled and followed a pattern similar to sefu for example his project clever defy was advertised as being unruggable in the faq why because the money was supposed to be safely locked up in the lp quote under a time lock mechanism that will allow access to keys only after 12 months in reality after one month money was being stolen out of the project under the function remove liquidity and i asked brian about this and he dodged the question instead he just asked me if i thought he would enjoy prison now i thought this was a pretty strange response and back when he was actually running the scam he gave a different answer he admitted money had been taken out but said quote it is correct analysis and then said don't worry it is not a negative a portion of lp was reallocated for funding he said this quote lp will be re-added and that people should be strong and huddle which is very similar to what safe moon said and in both cases was not true this lp would not be re-added and once again directly contradicts what brian said was possible with the lp he said all added liquidity will be locked without key access and clever defy wasn't the only scam there's also fetrova which is a fitness blockchain coin which brian said had partnerships with people like anytime fitness planet fitness and more they said so on their website when these gyms were approached about this partnership they said it was a lie quote i received your email we're not partners with vetrova we're not associated with vetrova and are working with our lawyers to take our names off their website fitness first is not connected with fetrova now this token would also tank but before it did it was listed on brian's new crypto exchange called the tags exchange later it would be delisted from it on october 5th citing a quote high security risk so you're hearing that right brian's exchange delisted brian's token for being a high risk and futrova ended as a disaster but now that he had a new grift going brian moved to this tax exchange where he promised people low fees and said his exchange had more volume than even binance namely tax exchange when i created that we ran for a good part of a year and we were really successful we're actually doing a lot more volume than finance at that time um and and the reason we were is because our fees were literally next to nothing like we were making just bugger roll like literally no profit which is kind of like free trading fees i suppose now brian claims he was basically making bugger all with his crypto exchange but as is a pattern with brian that is not true in fact people began reporting that they were not able to withdraw their money from his exchange brian would later shut it down claiming it was a business failure that he was making no money from it in reality it appears that he was being chased by accusations of fraud now this has all been a preamble to bring us to the main story seifu when i first confronted brian about his sketchy past i found it interesting that brian appeared to have been a fan of me and he said he liked my safe moon investigation but didn't like the fact that i was now investigating him but these dodges aren't going to work because now that we have a baseline for brian's past we're going to talk about sefu and the many problems with it starting with this outrageous apy i'm not gonna spend a long time with why this is so dumb and absurd i think actually showing you is better this is a call with one of their investors so that should mean that your money at the end of the year if everything goes according to plan um will be worth millions you'll be a millionaire after putting in two thousand dollars that's the hope now obviously that should be all you really need to see but of course there are more red flags our second red flag is the burn wallet which brian calls the fire pit now burning tokens is a common strategy in crypto and how it normally works is that you send tokens to a dead wallet that no one has access to so that the supply is reduced however when brian chose a wallet to burn to he didn't pick the normal one that everyone uses but rather used a wallet that he created and has access to which goes against every single premise of a burn wall but you should know according to him he pinky promises that he doesn't have access to this thing the fire pit wallet and there's obviously being asked a few times um if we do have keys to the wallet so if you've got access to the wallet the answer is no categorically no 100 no it's impossible to access we never had the keys to the fire pit wallet in the first place when we created the wallet we've done that on my ether wallet so yes we created it um and those and we created with a key store file which means you can download the keystore file with a password to access it we never downloaded it that file was deleted so that means that we can't have access to it now i don't know about you but this sounds all a little hard to believe and it's very reminiscent of his clever defy token where the keys were untouchable right up until they weren't just so you know this fire pit wallet has 32 million dollars of sefu in it right now but we're supposed to believe the keystore file was deleted now i know many of you are thinking how could anyone fall for this well as usual brian had an explanation for all this he told his followers he had to do it this way now there's we can't access it and the reason why it was created that way is because we can't have a auto compounding feature on a dead address it needs to be a normal wallet in order to have that compounding feature so that's the reason so please don't think we can access the wallet because no that's not the way the protocol was designed it's just it's a it's a limitation of the blockchain to have to have that wallet like a normal wallet enable to get that compounding feature that's all it's a blockchain limitation it's not an idea of mine or anybody else is just that's what needs to happen now it probably won't surprise you guys but this is not correct it turns out it was an idea of brian's and it's not a limitation of the blockchain at all he could have done it with a dead wallet a fact that even his own admins confirm so this live burn wallet created by brian legend he said that the reason he created it that way was the wallet had to be live you couldn't actually create it if it you can't rebase it if it's dead and the question is is that true um it has come out that that is not true so the question is who believes this stuff i mean the guy literally set up a burn wallet that he controls that has 32 million dollars in it and the community is just supposed to believe that he deleted his password it's so absurd that again like this is why it was kind of i didn't want to cover it at first i was like nobody's going to fall for this stuff but after talking to investors it it gets a lot worse this guy says that it's all about trust he created the wallet but he didn't download the keystore file do you know how easy it would be to lie about something like that yeah it would be extremely easy um there's no doubt about it it just boils down to trust now this investor into seifu who's also a admin should really know better than trusting people blindly it came out that he had invested in both safe moon and piggy tokens decisions he now admits were mistakes oh trust me i know and i will never involve myself into a sketchy shady project and i i realize you know from an outside perspective you do a lot of investigations into a safe moon but know this i got i got pretty hard with safe moon then i got again with piggy bank so why are you involved in safe food then as i've done my research and it's a legitimate project wow well there you go that's the mentality of these scams no matter how much evidence no matter how obvious the fraud or if they've been through frauds before sometimes holders will believe right up until the very end that this project is different even now brian is trying to spin the narrative with his followers saying that the reason he won't respond to my very basic questions are that i have quote offended him by using the words shady dealings and that that's why he blocked me not because he couldn't answer questions about his previous scams now as for the future of sefu i predict that it will continue to make money as long as they can find more suckers however all ponzi-like schemes do come to an end and this one will be no different brian will abscond with millions of dollars while most of his followers end up with little to nothing and he will move on citing seifu as yet another business in his past that failed for seemingly no reason thanks for watching pump the stock and i'll see you in the next one
