so why did they decide to call it Java the technology is legendary okay can we just take a moment and maybe not put Java like that I mean legendary um I don't know about that but how and why Sun Microsystems eventually settled on the name Java was always something of a mystery even to those involved okay when Time magazine called Java one of the 10 best products of 1995. what does that even mean okay this is the oh this might be the craziest sentence okay I thought calling Java legendary having Time Magazine calling it one of the best 10 products what what does that even mean uh a new American Marketing Legend was born who said let's see who's to say whether Sun Microsystems price technology would have fared so well if its name had been renamed to Oak or green talk two of the earlier choices ah green talk a little iteration on small talk huh uh we all know the story a giveaway An Elegant open source programming environment and the world will beat a path to your door no sweat no matter what you decide to call it the people charged with establishing a brand identity for Sun's programming language for Next Generation application developers though decided upon a coffee metaphor for their trademark Oak the previous name was taken damn classic um let's see but why choose Java by their own accounts something of a mystery this group interview originally published in Java World 1996 offers a fascinating look back on how Java got its name okay so how Java became Java the lawyer okay quote we're doing a quote here oh from Oak Technologies lawyers had told us we couldn't name it Oak said Frank yellin the senior engineer at Sun the name was already trademarked by Oak Technologies so a brainstorming session was held to come up with ideas for a new name the session was attack attended by a small uh small Oh by all oh my goodness the session was attended by okay TJ's making fun of me I can hear him laughing at me being unable to read the session was attended by all members of what was uh then called the Live Oak group damn feels bad those of us actively working on the new language the end result was about 10 possible names uh oh my goodness the end result was that about 10 possible names that were chosen they were then submitted to the legal department oh no we've chosen 10 names legal legal department which one can we do three of them came back clean Java DNA and silk oh man imagine if Java was named silk just imagine for a second if silk was the name no one remembers who first came up with the name Java only one person to my best knowledge has ever suggested in public to being the creator of the name Kim police who was the oak product manager at the time remembers things differently I named Java she I mean that's what she said that's what she said I spent a lot of time and energy on naming Java because I wanted to get precisely the right name I wanted something that reflected the essence of the technology Dynamic revolutionary Lively fun because this programming language was so unique I was determined to avoid nerdy names I also didn't want anything with net or web in it because I find those names very forgettable I wanted something that was cool unique and easy to spell and fun to say you know history always provides us such a fun look into the past not only do you type the word calm constantly in Java but Java is now synonymous with not fun how great is that that somehow cool unique three of its apparent two out of three of its goals are now considered defeated I love that I love being able to look back into history and see someone's intention and just see that intention crumble before your eyes public static void main this sucks which is string arms of course uh I gathered the team together in a room or wrote up the on the Whiteboard words like Dynamic alive jolt can we go back to what she said uh or who she is product manager okay this makes sense because this this fear this feels this this feels like what a product manager would do everybody sit down write stuff on the board dynamic there's probably a pause alive maybe a deep breath jolt what is that soda Jolt Cola yeah I want it I want Snappy like jolt impact revolutionary Etc and led the group in brainstorming I can hear my kids don't don't mind them uh police said the name Java emerged during that session the other names included DNA silk Ruby huh and whirl for Web Runner language yuck Sammy show you this Shale I do not say that name uh then a sun engineer recalls a brainstorm meeting held sometime around January of 1995. it's actually hard to say where Java first came from but it ended up on the list of candidates we chose along with silk lyric pepper net Pros neon man neon is everywhere and a host of others too embarrassing to mention some other candidates were a web dancer and web spinner said Chris worth who was an engineer on the project from its Inception yeah web dancer sounds just genuinely the worst thing I've ever heard in my life Dodge Neon still out there on the road somewhere there's a Dodge Neon driving right now going I'm the true Neon although marketing wanted a name that implied an association with the web or the net I think we did a very I think we did very well to pick a name that wasn't associated with either one Java is likely to find a true home in applications far from the internet so it's so it's best that it wasn't pigeonholed early get it as far away as possible please James Gosling do you think he's related to any other goslings you think maybe do you think his brother Ryan you know could also comment on this uh Java's Creator remembers uh that the name originated in a meeting where about a dozen people got together to brainstorm they love this term brain there's a lot of brainstorming you know I actually did a brainstorm meeting one time so we had this project called Falcor Falcor was named after the luck dragon in never-ending story and Falcor we thought since we're a movie company and we're releasing this open source product maybe we should uh uh maybe we should have like a different name for it so we had a brainstorming meeting and by brainstorming what we did is we went to the pub across the street ordered several beers and drank for the evening until somebody came up with a name and you know after six hours of drinking and all that we actually came up with the name Falcor spell with a K that's not a joke that legitimately happened and then that became this whole like era of Netflix which was there's Falcor with the c then there was Falcon with a K and then there's Falcon with a c again and there's like this this thing that happened we called it middle Falcor okay middle Falcor was such a train wreck but Falcor with the K so beautiful uh and then after all of that here's the best part of the whole situation um during that evening you know what I wanted to call it okay this was during the height of House of Cards so House of Cards season one was out at this point okay so people loved House of Cards Right House of Cards was an amazing show season one it was super cool and I wanted to call it Stamper I thought Stamper was a great name for a project that was my goal was to call it Stamper I didn't get it I didn't get it we called it Falcor with a k Stamper yeah dude Stamper was a great one Stamper was like my favorite character can we all agree that in that show Stamper was the best if alcoholic I love Stamper everybody loves Stamper Java is an island yes it is Douglas Stamper yeah it is an OG he is get stuck exactly that was that was literally my tagline that was my tagline they're like why Stamper I'm like it gets done everybody else is talking Stamper does the work right that was my whole point I thought it was a great name should have called it Indonesia well anyways okay there's my naming story I think everybody has a naming story if you've ever worked in open source you have a naming sort a story and it's a lot of fun it's honestly really fun uh it's just a lot of fun to do uh the meeting arranged by Kim police was fundamentally continuous a continuous wild craziness lots of people just yelled out words this is such a 90s brainstorming meeting we're gonna write inspiration on the board and people are gonna just scream out who yelled at first is unknoble and unimportant it felt like half the words in the dictionary were yelled out at one time or another there was a lot of I like this because and I don't like that because and at the end we a whittled it to a list of about a dozen names and handed it off to the lawyers gosh what a great story we were really disgusted uh and tired from all the marathon hacking we've been doing at the time and we we still hadn't found a name that we could use said Timothy Lindholm an engineer on the project we were pressed for time as adopting a new name meant a lot of work and had a re and had releases coming up so we set up a meeting to thrash out a list of names I do not remember there being a particular champion of java among the people from the original group that I've talked about uh talked to about this most deny any memory of java being anything but something that bubbled out of the group dynamic I believe the name was first suggested by Chris Warth said Arthur Vanhoff then senior engineer nobody knows who said this this is actually this is incredible by the way this is a great great story we had been in the meeting for hours and while he was drinking a cup of Pete's Java oh Pete's Coffee was known as Pete's Java back then he picked up Java as an example of yet another name that would never work the initial reaction was mixed I I believe the final candidates were silk DNA and Java however picked it up that's not good that's not gonna work oh that's different P oh yeah hey dude oh my goodness this is so good picked up Java that's never gonna stick that is such a good story yeah we looked at Java we thought there's no way that's ever gonna work out anyways it worked out came over there thought Java meant like cool and refreshing and hip and new and so we figured we wanted to be that as a language and today we feel very cool hip and new Java everybody loves Java right uh I suggested lingua Java but that didn't make it really really we could not trademark the other name so Java ended up being the name of choice and in the end the marketing person Kim please finally decided to go ahead with it holiday landed on coffee I test marketed the name on at parties and on my friends and family members police were called and Java got the most positive reactions from all the candidates oh nice okay qualitative study let's go qualitative marketing is a very good thing to do I think it's really good because it wasn't certain that we would like think of react when react first started like really think about it what was it considered reactive in any sort of sense sort of you know it wasn't I mean it didn't have any like reactive fundamentals but it sticks it's a very sticky name right it's a very it has a good name to it you know you got you gotta appreciate a good name that sticks in your head but it wasn't like angular angular like angular right like that did not take off nearly the same as a react because react is such a exciting programming term you know what I mean it's so sticky you can't even get rid of it angular is the exactly angular is such a like you know and the worst part is is that they didn't even go with a little Omega their their logo their logo uh their logo should have been uh angular momentum like if you're gonna go full dumb you should have at least gone with the little W where's the little double where's the Little W right isn't that angular momentum am I completely wrong here am I the dumb one I thought it was a little Omega you're right yeah yeah I'm the idiot uh it's it's Sigma I'm I don't think it's Sigma dog angular velocity ah crap I see I'm too stupid it's angular angular angular okay this is this is what your brain looks like after 15 years of not doing College okay there you go it is okay so it's angular velocity angular velocity gets the Omega you should have dropped the Omega right yeah yeah small Omega I knew a small Omega LK 99 is it a little Omega you can't you can't just come in here with the name little Omega while I'm saying it drop LK 99 it's just not even allowed because I wasn't let's see because it wasn't certain that we would get any of the names cleared through trademark I selected about three or four and worked with the lawyers on clearing them Java passed and it was my favorite so I named the language Java and subsequently named the browser hot Java uh that's a Bad Name by the way hot Java as much better name than Web Runner these Engineers had a hard time parting with uh Oak but they finally got used to it I felt that branding was very important because I wanted Java to be a standard so I focused on building a very strong brand for Java someone say she kind of dark roasted that Java uh Yellen recalled a final meeting to vote the name every person got to rank Java DNA and silk in order of their preference gosh if only the if only you know that Society if meme if if we would have named Java silk think of it think think of society today um the same name uh got the most favorite votes uh also got the most least favorite votes so it was dropped and the remaining two Java got the most votes come on what was the other one it came down to Silk or Java and Java went out damn think about how close that is think about how close we got Ryan Gosling seemed to favor Java over silk Kim police had the final say over the name since she was the product manager but most decisions back then were done by everyone kind of agreeing and then someone would say okay uh this is what we're doing Eric Schmid uh then Sun's Chief technology officer said he was certain about the origin of the name oh really we met in early 1995 at 100 Hamilton wow dude I'm actually positive about it we actually met at this address location at this time of the day uh in one of our standard operating reviews uh for a little businesses like Oak uh Bert Sutherland was a senior manager at the time he worked for me and he and Kim and a few others including James uh Gosling uh were there Kim presented that one we had to choose a new name now and two Oak which uh which we were all used to was taken as I recall she proposed two names Java and silk one of the two she strongly preferred Java and represented that the that live oak team was in agreement Bert and I decided to approve her recommendation and the decision was made for those reasons I believe it is correct to give Kim the credit for the name she presented it and sold it and then made it happen in in marketing but I do see let's see but I do seem to recall that Kim was initially lukewarm to the name Java uh Chris Chris Warth not happy about this Chris Wharf is not happy at the time we were also trying to rename our brother to Web Runner which uh which had already been taken by talagant talent and something that wasn't already trademarked Kim one of the uh things like web spinner or even web dancer is that a reference to a spider uh something that would make it clear that it was the world wide web product the trademark search was done and after several weeks a short list uh of cleared names came back there seemed to be an endless series of meetings and approvals that were necessary this is so good imagine how much money was spent on naming Java and then its subsequent completely forgotten never heard of browser called hot Java this is so good Kim wanted us to hold up the release so we could find a better name than Java but she was overruled by Engineers especially James and art oh wow oh whoa we got some contrary evidence here Kim taking all the credit but you know what James Warren to say I don't think so at one point James said we're going to go with Java and hot Java and Kim sent some emails asking us to wait for other names that might clear James wrote back and said no we're going to go with what we had and we did we just did a very quick set of renames in the source code and put the release out in the end I think the marketers and vice president had far less to say about the name than the engineers who were dying to get something out the door gigachad move I think Kim is rewriting history a bit when she says suggests that she picked this name for some Savvy marketing reason worth added oh the Steepy hot drama here we ended up with this a name because we ran out of options and we wanted to get our product out the marketing justifications came later Savage silk drama boys we got that Silk sheet satin goodness drama going right now Sleepless in Palo Alto I don't claim to be the one who first suggests the name said worth when a question about van Hoff statement it definitely was Pete's Java we were drinking but it might have been me or James or someone else I just don't recall exactly who said it but it definitely wasn't Kim that son of a not camp the feeling the feeling among myself and James and the other Engineers was that we called it and it would be popular worth added in the end it doesn't matter who originally suggests the name because it was ultimately a group decision perhaps uh helped Along by a handful of caffeinated people Timothy Linden the engineer concluded all my homies hate him dude first Kim starts out as the hero in this story now I'm over here like I don't think I like him Kim has been take credit for Java which she shouldn't have I think the extent to which the people involved have considered the history of Java's name without arriving at any general agreed upon resolution shows that the naming of Jabba was not done by some heroic individual but by a byproduct of a creative and driven group trying very hard to achieve their goals of which this name was part okay reasonable I would encourage you not to strive beyond what is reasonable in ascribing the naming of java to an individual that is simply not the way things worked in those days don't be fooled by how individuals and the media have dude it's the media the media man the media damn it you know what they're doing I wish I could do a good Alex Jones I can't don't be fooled by the individuals in the media uh and subsequently filtered many elements of Java's creation to fit their own ends you know the media trying to fit their own ends about the creation of java everybody knows that you know why it's because they had Java world 1996. it was an Infowars 2022. see Alex Jones has been behind us this whole time damn seven reasons why Java's still great I actually want to read that because I just don't believe truly a society Kim is the media your beard sucks whoa hey hey my Razor broke and my wife buys me everything from my shirts to my my hoodie and she hasn't bought me a razor this is not made up and so I just haven't shaved
