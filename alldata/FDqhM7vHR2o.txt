FTX tried to hide billions of dollars in fraud and now their xdeo Sam bankman freed is trying to convince everyone it was an accident he isn't such a bad guy he just got in over his head and already there are Financial commentators like Kevin O'Leary willing to vouch for him I just think he's a very interesting individual over time we'll peel this onion find out what happened I don't think that guy has a an evil bone in his body now it may not surprise you but Kevin O'Leary is a paid spokesman for FTX but even unpaid sources have parroted his claims take for instance the New York Times They quote SPF saying he was just distracted and that's why FTX fell apart quote had I been a bit more concentrated that would have allowed me to catch on to what was going on on the risk side that's right guys if he only hadn't played League of Legends he might have noticed he was stealing customer money now of course the New York Times was roasted for their uncritical take on Sam as was Kevin O'Leary but even respected Financial journalists that I personally like like Matt Levine of Bloomberg have recently floated theories around that maybe this is fraud but maybe not quote I don't want to minimize the likelihood of intentional fraud and theft but I want to say that the story of FTX also reads like what would happen if you and a few College friends set up a gigantic International Financial exchange your friends are Traders and Engineers not accountants and compliance officers they're running a huge exchange and are too busy for paperwork they move fast and break things now stories like that to me leave me wondering well was this fraud at all was it just a couple of college grads who didn't know the value of an accountant could be either one right and I want to address this not because anyone in the media specifically believes that Sam isn't a fraudster besides Kevin O'Leary probably because of course there are plenty of legal reasons not to explicitly call someone a fraud but I still think it's relevant to address these ideas and narratives either way because you can be certain this is going to be sbf's defense he may have been dumb he may have been negligent he may have made some mistakes but he isn't a criminal he already came out and said it once I effed up twice but instead of mentioning fraud he says it's because of poor internal labeling that FTX fell apart which I mislabel things all the time and in a way that's a compelling simple explanation don't attribute to malice what you can attribute to stupidity or in this case don't attribute to fraud what you can attribute to a follicle of 20 year olds in the Bahamas getting in over their heads that is basically what he wants you to believe and so I'm here to answer that question could it possibly be that FTX is just a story of negligence well the short answer is no and the long answer is hell no since FTX unraveled I've been speaking to Alameda insiders FTX insiders even people who called out FTX months ago like short seller Mark cohotis and the one thing I'm positive of after all of it is that Sam is probably the greatest con man of Our Generation the only real question I have is why did it take us so long to find this out now as I share the evidence that supports this claim bear in mind compiling a complete postmortem on FTX is admittingly difficult a paper shredder leaves behind better evidence than Sam bankman fraud sorry I mean freed well not freed for long he's gonna probably be in jail soon but until that sweet day arrives just understand that I don't have the full story yet nobody does even the people who have full access to the back end evidence are still puzzled in fact the main person tasked with handling the FTX bankruptcy process also handled Enron which is the definition of complicated corporate fraud so you'd think it'd be no big deal right nope FTX is worse than inron quote never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls not only that he says that everything he got from SBF in the way of evidence he has quote no confidence in which uh you know isn't great this is probably because a Sam has lied NP it sounds like everything in his Empire was a mess allegedly FTX was approving expenses with quote personalized emojis and that Sam was communicating with disappearing messages that were set to Auto delete after quote a short period of time not only that Sam encouraged employees to do the same so understand that we don't have a full picture of what happened yet in part because well they deliberately avoided leaving one and I would actually point to this as the first piece of evidence of fraud you don't show up to the scene of a crime with billions missing and find out all the evidence is destroyed and say oh darn maybe they accidentally torched it no that in of itself is suspicious and deleting your text messages and encouraging your employees to do the same that just screams that you're hiding something but even though they didn't leave us much to go on there's still tons of breadcrumbs that lead us to the same conclusion for example take the corporate structure of FTX in all their subsidiaries we've talked about this it's incredibly complicated but I'm supposed to believe the guy who set this up is the same guy who didn't know it was wrong for him to take from one company and steal it uh isn't this the same guy whose parents are both compliance lawyers sticklers for the rules you're telling me that guy doesn't understand what basic fraud is incidentally this is actually why Kevin O'Leary thought this was such a safe bet I'm a paid spokesperson to uh to FTX and a shareholder there too and big advocate for Sam because he has two parents that are compliance lawyers if there's ever a place I could be that I'm not going to get in trouble it's going to be at FTX yikes and yet even after being defrauded Kevin says given the chance he'd bet on Sam again if SPF knocked on your door again and said look I failed in my last Venture uh I have a new crypto Adventure I need money would you back him that's a great question no one's asked me yet I think we can all admit you can love him or hate him given what's happened but he was one of the most brilliant traders in the crypto Universe he also built one of the most robust platforms we used FTX actively it was a very robust platform uh that allowed us to get information on a compliant basis so I really like what he built would you back him the answer would be yes unbelievable I don't understand how these people can't admit they were fooled by SBF and just end up making fools of themselves now there's another part of this story I want to talk about which was of course the Revelation that FTX The Exchange and Alameda research the trading firm were actually sharing customer funds and there's been some talk of well maybe this was just a lack of compliance or accounting but I want to suggest to you that SBF was not lacking anything he purposely and deliberately profited from the vague relationship between Alameda and FTX and the first sign of this was when I spoke to an Insider at Alameda he told me that they would often use Insider knowledge of the coins that were going to be listed on FTX and then they would go buy those coins up knowing that it would pump in price when it was finally listed in other words an easy profit could be made this by the way is similar to what happened on coinbase and three people were arrested for insider trading in that case but unlike coinbase they this wasn't Rogue employees this was Alameda itself doing this so let me get this straight if it was criminal when three individuals did it what does it mean when an entire organization does it I even asked the Alameda Insider if they thought that it was criminal behavior and they told me quote it was probably criminal in hindsight yeah you know about the 2020 of hindsight sometimes you realize wow that was probably illegal now this Insider evidence is actually further validated by public reports that Alameda research amassed swaths of tokens ahead of FTX saying it would list them according to an analysis of public blockchain data this is from The Wall Street Journal and it just corroborates this Insider testimony there's insider trading going on at Alameda so do you think someone Sam who is doing criminal activity is going to want a bunch of accountants and compliance people sniffing around no they're going to want criminals hanging around them so with that said and completely unrelated guess who FTX chose as their Chief regulatory officer this guy Dan Friedberg now Dan's past is very important because he used to work for ultimate bet a poker site which got in a lot of trouble and has a very shady past for reasons we've explained before ultimate bet got in trouble because they were giving some of their players a god mode that allowed them to see the other pokers players cards which would obviously be an advantage if you're trying to play poker wow so Friedberg was working for ultimate bet during these god mode days and although he was never charged with anything there is leaked audio coming out from him conspiring to hide the owner of ultimate bet from facing any consequences from using it here's Russ Hamilton the former owner of ultimate bet who used god mode and admits to making money with it telling Friedberg that he wants to get out of this cheating scandal I feel and I and I did take this money and I'm not trying to make it right Dan so we've got to get that out of the way right real quick okay so then Dan Friedberg replies to Russ that maybe they should just blame it all on a third party consultant and say that was who used the god mode on their website instead of Russ himself I think to the public it just says former consultant albums of a server flaw of hacking in the clients been able to identify exactly when sometimes he played with it sometimes he played Without sometimes he intentionally won and sometimes the intentionally lost very erratic play but we've been able to identify at the times when the Tool was up and they're not one of these what you could also say is that the tools were originally set for a 15-minute delay and he's hacked it to her to a real time but that's what we do so this is the guy they hired at FTX as their Chief regulatory officer a guy who once conspired to hide his cheating boss and of course there are more red flags about the relationship between FTX and Alameda you might assume that like okay if it was negligence maybe everyone inside the organization was just sharing information with everyone there was there was no walls in place right and that's what created the conflicts of interest but that doesn't match with what we've heard I personally have spoken to FTX insiders who said they were blindsided by the collapse they didn't know anything The Wall Street Journal also reports that FTX employees were completely in the dark which corroborates that so FTX employees had no idea what was going on at Alameda meanwhile the Alameda employees on the other hand knew exactly what was going on at FTX they had backend access so this relationship wasn't uncontrolled it was one-sided back to the god mode analogy it was almost as if they specifically set up their crypto exchange to be pill for offered by their Traders without anyone knowing almost like they had a back door oh oh yeah they did end up building a back door I forgot their CTO built a back door to avoid triggering red flags see it's hard to call things like this accidents or negligence it's literally designed to be hidden Alameda had a one-way window into FTX to steal whatever they wanted from client funds and I do mean steal not misappropriate not negligently lose steel but unbelievably the way it's quoted in like the New York Times you'd think this was some kind of loan they took out a margin position it's called but we know now it wasn't a margin position Alameda apparently had a secret exemption from certain aspects of ftx.com's Auto Liquidation protocol according to their new CEO so this large margin position isn't a margin position at all because they could never be liquidated and I'm sure Dan Friedberg might be somewhere on a call trying to figure out how to blame a rogue employee on this secret exam attention but let's be honest with ourselves Alameda knew what they were doing was criminal that's why they call it a secret exemption and they were even willing to lie about it to keep it a secret Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison denied special access to Bloomberg News saying we definitely have a Chinese wall in terms of information sharing to ensure that no one at Alameda would get customer information from FTX or any sort of special treatment from FTX but obviously this was a lie here Sam bankman freed lying too quote Alameda is a wholly separate entity well we know that isn't true either looking back it was obvious because even when you'd wire the money to FTX the international wiring instructions were to Alameda research not exactly separate and so after finding all of this out I spoke to Mark cohotis who called out SBF as a fraud much earlier than almost anyone else and I asked him his thoughts and he said this was all obvious a mile away I knew something was wrong a year ago because everything this guy said and you can play all his interviews back nothing added up you know nothing added up if people ask me a question I will give them an answer or say I don't know I won't talk in a figure eight you know I won't answer a question with a non-answer again and again and again nothing this guy said has ever made a lick a sense and if he would have come to my office looking for money I would have told him to hit the bricks because nothing added I mean they didn't even figure out that his accountants address was somewhere in the metaverse I mean at a minimum you check out who the guy's auditor is and say who's your auditor oh my Auditor's name is is the Pep Boy Manny Moe and Jack okay what's his address somewhere in the metaverse is this a joke no I'm being serious now I know what you're thinking surely that can't be true that the auditor of FTX was located in the metaverse but checking their official bankruptcy filings that is the case and now because no one looked into it FTX owes 3.1 billion dollars to its top 50 creditors alone and I guess if they have complaints they can go to the metaverse and ask about it I'm just kidding well kind of I actually don't think they probably take complaints in the metaverse either way the question of was Sam bankman freed a fraud is not much of a question at all the real question is why did so few people catch on early and why didn't the media catch on sooner I'm not sure we can speculate maybe it was because of political donations or this whole story about effective altruism But ultimately what I know for sure is that people like Marco hodis they weren't silent he says he took it to journalists before the crash to see if they'd do anything and they said no I went to Bloomberg with my pal who I was working on this thing with and we laid it out to five crypto five ladies on the crypto team and they passed and they said it would be too much work we'd lose access it's bad for business right they'd hang up on us if we ask these questions well at least I had the questions denied a story with you because they thought it would lose them access and it was too much work yes a hundred percent when when did this happen this happened in July this happened in early July they had everything they had everything wow they they also said But I didn't want anyone fired I didn't want anyone fired so I didn't get this they said it was bad for business I.E advertising you're kidding so so they admit their conflict of interest with advertisers in the crypto space yes now this is pretty shocking allegations so I did want to reach out to Bloomberg for comment to see if they wanted to respond to this and here's what they said
