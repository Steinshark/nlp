ladies and gentlemen welcome back to the most exciting World Chess Championship match the Chess World has seen in a very long time it's yanyupomnushi of Russia it's dingly ran of China they've played nine games the score is five for Yan and four four dig to win you need to score seven and a half points because they play 14 games this is game number 10 and today in game number 10 I'm not gonna say anything not gonna be too many spoilers or any at all but today was a disaster and today something very very bad happened let's jump in so ding has surveyed both D4 and C4 in this match uh some of them have worked out quite well like the games that he won in the London and the English others did not work out so well uh like the game that he played this very offbeat Pawn to H3 that was game number two that feels like it was centuries ago but no it it it very much was during the duration of this match this time he plays the English again Knight to F6 by Yan Knight C3 E5 the same exact setup by the way uh Jan doesn't play E5 straight away he plays Knight F6 and that I think is actually taking a little bit of the sting out of the move G3 uh I I do suppose that with this move you are inviting some main lines with C4 E5 G3 the king's Bishop English where this Knight doesn't actually have to be on the C3 Square uh this time Pawn to E5 we have the Four Knights and you will remember that the last time we played the Four Knights English or maybe you do not remember whatsoever didn't play the mainline E3 Bishop B4 Queen C2 and took like this and then put his Pawn on e4 and and so on um this time he plays E4 in one go now traditionally speaking this move has been kind of looked at uh in a very odd way I mean it just simply doesn't make any sense like okay you're stopping the move D5 but you're doing this in a way that your D4 square is terrible uh you're blocking in your Bishop like why is your Pawn there I mean if you wanted to play a Four Knights it's like a four nights game right like let's say it's like four nights typical beginner chess but then for some reason instead of putting the bishop out to C4 or something you put the pawn out to C4 is this good is this bad I don't know time will tell well uh we have Bishop to C5 now I've I've also faced Bishop B4 in this position and remember from the previous game Bishop B4 can actually become something that looks very similar to what we saw in the other game um so after Bishop B4 uh White can still kind of maintain the central grasp Bishop C5 has a very direct idea uh Bishop C5 is an extremely forcing move and if you're gonna play the move E4 Bishop C5 comes in and the truth is that if white just develops normally white is just worse because this bishop is better than this bishop black will play A6 so the bishop can leave and very good control of D4 and if white plays something like D3 to play Bishop G5 black will play H6 so basically black is like threatening literally to have a better position on move 4. that's not where disaster struck in this game I do apologize by the way if I sound like terrible uh allergies bit of a cold she's not feeling great uh but uh feels much better than having coveted four months ago I'll tell you that much um and the only way that white has a way to get an advantage in this position is by playing a trick white has a trick in this position and that trick is Knight takes E5 this is called the center Pawn fork trick and it also occurs in fortnite's positions this is for some of the more advanced beginners watching technically the move Bishop C4 is inaccurate in the Four Knights because of 94 and 94 D5 um of course white saves the bishop and white is still completely fine uh but uh in this game in particular you are trying to do the exact same thing this works if they have to take back with the Knight and then it also works if you then have a fork um now again of course black should save the bishop um black also in this position can play Bishop takes F2 check which is kind of a funny move uh but it doesn't really work uh because uh I just get too much okay you could check me I can go back to G1 H3 and life is good so D4 Bishop B4 pitting the Knight to the queen there is nothing else except taking now black will respond Knight E4 and now white here can play Queen D4 Queen F3 and I think Queen G4 if I'm not mistaken uh there is some really ridiculous line uh that the computer I think needs a little bit of time to think about but definitely Queen D4 and definitely Queen F3 are lines maybe Queen D3 is also a line I've seen Queen G4 and queen G7 uh but uh black really like has to know the line there of course these guys do know the line so uh Queen F3 is played in the game hitting the Knight and defending this Knight C3 bc3 and now we can sort of breathe you will notice both guys have played nine moves in two minutes so they clearly know what they're doing white has accepted a bad structure or a very Advanced Center Pawn uh attacking possibilities on the king and a bit more of an active queen with the move Queen to G3 it's actually very difficult for black to defend this Pawn in fact black if they play G6 will probably just already landed a completely like lost position um White against Bishop D3 Bishop G5 H4 H5 Castle position is is like really really really miserable uh for uh for black um now Jan plays King f8 okay and you'll notice after Bishop C5 dig actually spent quite a bit of time here uh that might be because the main line is Bishop A5 so Bishop going here instead of there is probably what ding had prepared because this actually has a very clear Target like retreating the bishop to A5 seems natural then after Queen to G3 black even can start firing back because taking on G7 of course just runs into Bishop C3 uh Bishop E5 and then Bishop A1 um but he plays Bishop C5 which is clearly what he prepared right Queen to G3 and now King to f8 Black now not only has a lack of space in the center and white has attacking chances black also cannot Castle so instead of weakening his own Pawn structure black has opted to sacrifice the castling rights now visually it looks like white has a fantastic position uh White is going to go here or here Bishop F4 white is going to Castle uh White model bring the second Rook but listen young played all these moves without thinking so obviously he knows what he's doing uh ding develops the bishop to E2 again 15 minutes to develop either this this or this that's wild I mean I would love to know what he was calculating uh he chooses Bishop E2 he chooses Bishop E2 for a couple of reasons I think Bishop D3 He didn't like that the queen would hit the bishop he also probably did not like that when The Rook goes here it's not actually sufficiently like pressuring anything because the bishop is in the way so he chooses to put the bishop on E2 young plays D6 in a minute right because young doesn't have anything else I mean Jan like he cannot move any of his back rank of pieces so he needs to play D6 uh now ding plays Bishop F4 with the intention of recapturing like this setting up that and that and uh Rook D1 as well again visually position looking absolutely fantastic for white but he's down 25 minutes and just judging from the time management and the complete ridiculous ridiculousness of this position probably yeah knows something about this and uh finally he thinks for the first time he plays Queen to E7 um and uh we have Rook to D1 played by uh played by ding obviously centralizing he doesn't want to capture yet and in this position Yan plays the move H5 now you want to know something fascinating about this position of course you do you're watching this recap this is move 13 of the World Chess Championship dingley ran is white Yani pomichi is black this position has occurred before three years ago was playing White has actually seen this position before I don't know if he remembers that though because that game in 2020 was played in title Tuesday on chess.com Jan was white against a 2400 the 2400 had this position with black Jan had this position with white isn't that insane I don't think I mean does Yan know that that would be a completely unbelievable I mean if he just remembered a totally obscure title Tuesday game from over three years ago that would be Sensational stuff so Jana has actually played this exact same thing with white which means he thinks it's pretty good uh and in that game uh Jan played H4 uh and actually I think after de Bishop E5 Bishop G4 I think Jan was uh I mean struggling a little bit with white uh but you won of course because he's the better player it was an equal game though uh but actually white does not need to overreact and play H4 at all uh White can just castle and that's exactly what ding does and he maintains kind of this slightly Pleasant position but the truth is because White's structure is so bad uh he needs to win I mean he needs to win using his pieces over here if he's unable to Black will just build up a fortress and be completely fine so now ding does in fact allow H4 uh and rotates his Queen to D3 He would like to go here and here and the Avalanche would fall on black I mean black is just moments away from being in a critical situation for example if black just plays a lack of date well I guess D6 is hanging but uh you know if you allow white to maximally improve with rookie one white is just in great shape so in this position ding needs to resort to Violent measures he needs to resort to uh off-beat measures to try to fight back and he does that he has now moved his H Pawn all the way forward his pieces are kind of stuck he hasn't moved any of these back row pieces and it continues as he plays the move G5 I mean this is ludicrous this is completely insane that you can play chess like this you can just play your H and G pawns you don't have to Castle I mean it looks like black is a 700 like really like it looks like white is maybe like a trainer like trying to coach black and black I'm not saying Jan is playing like a 700 he's playing like a 27.95 and is leading the world championship match but if you just take a snapshot of this position I mean it just looks completely absurd right this looks nice black has broken every principle in chess every single one and yet is not even worse now by the way if white Retreats he's simply losing the pod on E5 so it's time for ding to take on D6 and take on D6 and take on D6 and take on D6 oh and by the way if you didn't quite understand what the game plan was it was to take on D6 and take on D6 and take on D6 and take on D6 and I just brought this up I literally just brought this up because in my recaps I like to foreshadow things that happen in a minute to then recall them so really hammering that knowledge home I just mentioned to you a minute ago white structure is terrible right White's Pawn structure is terrible so white really needs to win the game because look at this this is White's Advantage it's three on two but the structure if this was here white is winning like easily because you just Advance the pawn and you create a past Pawn oops and the pawn is but you can't you have no way of creating a past pawn and not only can you not create a past Pawn I'm gonna go full Pac-Man on these pawns and that's it that's like you're not gonna win so ding is a touch better a touch like Boop Bishop to E6 announcing plays F4 now make no mistake if an amateur or even an advanced player had this position with black they would probably find a way to lose because it's not easy to defend it's not easy to defend in chess for example here black really only has one defensive plan can you find it if you thought it was G4 that's a terrible move and after F5 it's plus five so see there you go right like it you know uh now you could take out F4 but that's uh the real major idea here is to put the king into the center is to play King E7 Force The Rook back and uh when The Rook does come back UF takes and something like this and the Rooks are defending the pawn but they're not creating any offense now we have H3 that H Pawn has marched all the way down the board now it can freeze and whatever white does it really doesn't matter either you take and this is the ugliest Pawn structure of all time either you allow yourself to get taken but then I have like actual Targets on the G file or you play G4 and that's probably the best move the Rooks defend that and they defend that and your king can walk up to the G3 Pawn I mean it seems like you have all the major assets to win a game and yet you have no ability to go play defense The Rook is just like playing snake you ever play Snake on those phones back in the day I'm giving you all the 90s kids shout outs in today's recap uh I used to beg my dad to play Snake on his phone uh yeah I mean white can defend that thing but uh look at this white cannot cross at all none of White's pawns can move frankly White's Rooks can't move either and look at B6 that's it everything in Black's position is protected you just cannot cross the center line at all nothing can cross there is zero play to be created literally the only thing that white can do well let's watch King G3 Rook H6 rookie 4 pin king just walks out of the way now you would think giving a check is the right thing to do look at this oh infiltration oh my goodness The Rook is so scary yeah now The Rook just comes back The Rook just comes back and Jan is smart enough to realize he can part with the a pawn to win the C pawn and his Rook defends the v-pawn and at some point Rook trade won't even help Bishop B3 look at this fancy schmancy move sacrificing the bishop as a defensive measure we have takes Rook C3 and that's it now we're down to rook in three versus rook in three Rook B5 the only thing black needs to do is not trade Brooks why because King H3 and uh I mean I black can do anything king of six King H3 and that's just winning so Rook B5 Rook A3 and my friends uh this is very different the lesson there why is this winning but why is this a draw it's because of the Rooks the existence of the Rooks creates enough counter play for black that you do not lose this game and in fact he was so uh confident he played F5 just completely giving up the pawn because the pawn is going to be won back you can defend it King F6 but this end game after Rook F5 this is a draw King and two pawns or King in three pawns versus King and two is winning King and one is only winning if certain criteria are met and they're not met here H5 and game 10 is a draw and may I add something this was probably the worst game of the match I not from quality perspective this was uh the least fun game this was the game where nothing happened absolutely nothing happened when I I woke up this morning and I and I kind of groaned I was like oh no did they burn out all their fuse there's now games 11 12 13 and 14. ding has to win he's down five and a half four and a half he's got to win one of the games there is no alternative so um I don't know what's gonna happen but I look forward to game number 11. I I don't think we're ever gonna see ding play E4 E4 again on move four um young clearly came with bulletproof preparation Bishop C5 and it's kind of insane that Jan actually had this position and was one of the only people in the database to have this position but he played extremely creatively defensively sacrificed the pawn to get into an end game where he had virtually no losing chances defended actively and did a very nice job and um game 10 is in the books and it wasn't it wasn't the most fun but not all games can be decisive so I'll see you for game number 11. get out of here
