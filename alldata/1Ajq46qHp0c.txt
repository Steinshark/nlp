hello everyone and welcome in this video we are going to be talking about why hydrogen combustion engines are a dumb idea they're very cool engines uh unfortunately they're not the smartest way of using hydrogen for transportation so in this video we're going to be looking at two key differences between a hydrogen combustion engine and a hydrogen fuel cell and why using a hydrogen combustion engine maybe isn't the smartest thing to do now if you haven't yet you certainly don't have to but it could be worth checking out if not now after watching this video my videos on how a hydrogen combustion engine works as well as my video on how a hydrogen fuel cell works to help give you some background on what's going on between these two different things but in this video we're going to get into two major differences and why using a hydrogen fuel cell is so much better of an idea so first we need to talk about the reactions and so we're going to be looking at the process the chemical process that's occurring with each uh to determine you know what's the advantage here for fuel cells so ultimately out on the surface you know the very basic reaction we have two h2s hydrogen plus o2 oxygen and then we end up with two h2o so from our hydrogen combustion engine our only emission is water that sounds awesome with a fuel cell uh your reaction same thing two h2 plus o2 gives you two h2o your only byproduct is water awesome if both of these were true that'd be wonderful no difference between the two unfortunately with this hydrogen combustion engine because you have the heat of combustion that's what you're using to create that mechanical energy you're using heat and then you're pressing down that piston the heat in that combustion chamber excites these oxygens and nitrogens and they combine together and they form these nitrogen oxides so that's the bad news you don't want to form nitrogen oxides they're terrible for your health they're not great for the world you don't want them the good news is there's no carbon introduced in this equation so you don't have any carbon emissions but unfortunately you are producing nitrogen oxides with fuel cells the equation also is not as simple as it looks up here so really what's happening is you're taking your two h2s you are then using a catalyst to rip away the electrons from these hydrogen atoms so you're now left with four positively charged hydrogen atoms those electrons go off to do great things like power your vehicle or you know whatever else they're going to power and then they come back eventually because they're very kind so they come back they reform with that those h pluses that you have created earlier and then you introduce outside air to that equation in that outside air is oxygen so you take that four h plus you add to that the four electrons you add to that the oxygen and you end up with two h2o so your chemical process here you don't have any nitrogen oxide emissions you don't have any carbon emissions from an environmental standpoint fantastic because your entire process all your byproduct is just water great all right so reason number one fuel cells are better is for emissions reason number two is for efficiency and so if we look at a combustion engine you of course have your fuel tank that sends fuel to your engine the engine sends that power through a transmission that goes to a differential and then eventually powers your wheels so gasoline engines hydrogen engines they're generally going to be somewhere in the 25 to 35 percent efficiency range let's just assume a pretty decent estimate that we get 25 efficiency uh once we get to the wheels so of that fuel energy we have 25 of it actually helping to move that vehicle forward fuel cells on the other hand you start with a hydrogen tank you send that hydrogen to the fuel cell that's where this reaction right here is occurring then you create you send those electrons off to do wonderful things they go to the converter this is operating somewhere around about 60 efficiency uh some could be better some could be a little bit worse sending from that converter to your power control unit which then goes to your uh motor your electric motor and then from your electric motor to your gear reduction and then you of course do have a battery and you can help use that battery also to regenerate uh energy so when you're slowing down you can recover some of that energy another efficiency benefit of using it in this style here with that hybrid style with the battery there so you're basically you have an electric car that's powered by using hydrogen because you've got that electric motor up front so to the wheels you could be getting somewhere around 50 percent uh efficiency from what you started with the amount of energy that you started with and also taking the consideration that you're going to get some of it back as you're slowing down so it could be a little bit higher it could be a little bit lower but let's say it's 50 here and 25 percent here well double the efficiency so here one of the bad things about hydrogen is that it doesn't have a low energy density by volume so it requires a large amount of space in order to have a lot of energy well the downside to that is it means you have to have a massive fuel tank if you want to have a long range so if you have something like these two vehicles and one of them is twice as efficient that means if you want them to both go the same distance this one's going to have to have a fuel tank that's twice as large that's going to take up a ton of space cargo space passenger space not good you don't want that so the advantage goes here to having a much smaller hydrogen tank also you're instantly doubling your fuel costs if you're half as efficient so you're going to pay a lot more in fuel costs hydrogen is quite expensive per gallon so not a great thing if you know it's it's not very efficient and it has poor emissions versus something that has basically no carbon emissions no nitrogen oxide emissions and it doesn't have uh as we were discussing it's much more efficient at getting that power to the ground now of course you know where that energy comes from is important and that's another thing here if this is more efficient and hydrogen is very expensive and let's say you know in the ideal world you need renewable energy to be creating that hydrogen for this entire scenario uh to be environmentally friendly so you need half the energy uh and so that means you have need have those renewable energy producing resources if the vehicle is twice as efficient so you know kind of a cascading advantage to having a more efficient drive train you know you've got more passenger space you don't need as much energy produced for it you pay less in transporting it now the one advantage that this combustion engine certainly does have is this 10 type of style right here generally will cost less but unfortunately you know compared to a gasoline engine is it all that much of an advantage not necessarily so if you're going to use hydrogen it makes a lot of sense to use it in a fuel cell rather than as a combustion engine which is disappointing news for all the car enthusiasts around the world unfortunate sad quite a bummer i would love to hear you guys feedback in the comments below of course if you have any questions or comments you know what to do thank you all so much for watching
