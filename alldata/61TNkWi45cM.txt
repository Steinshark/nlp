as programmers one of the things that we all deal with every single day is lots of information from Individual courses to specific knowledge around languages and Frameworks that we use on our series and less serious projects that we build with our coding skills and it doesn't even end there there's stuff around lead code around job applications and this is so much for us to know and to keep track of which can become really really overwhelming this is exactly what happened to me one in the beginning I was really excited about everything and I loved learning this new skill at some point it got to the point where I felt like I was learning one thing but then I was forgetting in other things I wish that there was one place where I could just house all the knowledge and all of the concepts that I had gathered in my journey as a developer and so today after months of work I have created this system and I've called it developers brain developer's brain is a productivity system specifically designed with programmers in mind that is hosted in notion it's especially designed with beginners in mind give you the tools that you need to not only be as productive as possible as a programmer but to organize everything around your life as it relates to coding in one place I can set tasks for the day or schedule them later following the exact methodology used at established software development companies I can house all my project ideas in one place and seamlessly follow the best practices to build a project from scratch your way to store and track your job applications guides on how to use LinkedIn and much much more all of which I'm now going to show you in this brief run through of what you can find inside of developers brain and by the way if you choose to get this exact template that I'm gonna show you right now of course it will be fully customizable for you to take it to the exact place to make it your developer's brain your home for your programming life but now let's talk about what I have in here so when I open developers brain here is what I see I've gone for a very sort of minimalistic look to this entire thing because that's the sort of look that I usually prefer having a very clean interface to house everything in here just make see a lot more sort of cozy and makes me want to come back to this place later so for me personally those are really really important thing so we've got developers when there's sort of different sections here relating to different parts of a programmer's life first of all we've got tasks and productivity that allows you to track your tasks as a programmer when it comes to learning when it comes to projects and then you've got this review calendar and we'll by the way we'll go into all of these in detail in a second then you've got my projects Hub which is used to house all of your projects as a programmer from more serious to less serious ones we've got the career hub for or your job applications for your interview prep and some resume templates that you will also get as part of this for completely free then we've got my Learning Hub which is going to be particularly important for those of you in your beginning stages where you're perhaps just doing courses and you want to keep track of them you want to take notes and just house them all in one this is gonna be the place for you and I've also included lots of developer road maps or like pre-built templates for you to go from zero to a specific kind of developer job so you got access to all of that as well and then finally we've got my knowledge Hub which is used to house all your nodes so to start building your own Hub of documentation like around all of the things that you have specifically learned in your programming life so that's the high level then at the top we've got quick links that you can basically use to link to the most important Pages for you so for example for me I've got link to my learning path my projects tracker so like all of the things that I use the most and you can of course then just go and add additional links by just adding something in here maybe you want to link this page you can go in here and then copy link paste it in here and click on link the page and then that is going to be added to your quick links then we've got this toggle of today's agenda that's basically going to show you all the tasks that I do today and it's going to show you all the review calendar tasks that are going to be due today I'll show you in a second how this all works so if you just start going through all of this one by one first is just go to learning because that's going to be the place where most of you start when you're learning the code so if you click on it we have a while learning part we can essentially add all the courses that you're currently doing and the courses that you want to do the problem that I had in my own Learning Journey is that once I started doing a lot of courses Because by the way you sort of have to do a lot of them especially if you want to learn stuff like computer science and stuff like this you can add courses in here so you can sort of plan out what courses you want to do and add them to your backlog whenever you create a new page it's going to allow you to input a name and then once you go inside of the page then you can fill out a couple of these properties like what are the languages that you will be learning what's the platform where this thing is going to be hosted so you would do that and then to start writing notes to your course you can click on this template course notes template that's going to automatically give you a template that I have made myself like at the end of the course you want to fill out like one of the top things that you learned it's going to give you these templates for course notes for different modules that you want to then rename obviously to what are the actual modules inside of that course instead of the projects and exercises you can embed GitHub links for the projects and the tasks and the homework that you complete for that particular course and then any other materials you can embed PDFs in here and a bunch of other stuff and obviously then you can go and customize this and add like basically the goal of this is to house everything you need relating to this one course just on this one page so you have it in one place you don't have it scattered around like five different notes apps and maybe your file system like all this kind of stuff and then when once you're planning your order you can add things with the next stage these are the courses I'm doing right now and then obviously we've got done and let's say you decide that actually I don't want to do one of these courses I decide okay Django for burning isn't really important anymore because the python developer Master Class teaches General as well so you can just go and put it on abandon slash on hold on something that you might want to do in the future but you probably won't so it's just going to be separated out and if any of these you don't want to actually see what's inside of it so you want to hide it you can click on these three dots and then click on hide so you don't have to actually look at what are the abandoned courses but you still want to keep track of them just in case and then you can choose the view based on what you're interested in if you want to look at them as a list or as a board I personally like to look at them as a board because it's more visually tells me like what am I doing now etc etc then going back to the dashboard we have developer road maps which basically these like full-on guides to let's say you want to become a full stack python web developer you just click on it it's going to give you step by step like my recommended courses now of course it's a by no means the only option there's like a million different options to all of these but if I were to learn any of these given paths myself from scratch this is the exact path I would choose it's like step by step so if you just want to pre-build template for what you need to learn in order to get a job and to get basically job ready in any of these given Parts you can just literally like blindly follow all of this and the cool thing that I've added in here is that let's say you choose like you read through these and you choose like yeah I'm gonna want to become a full stack JavaScript developer rather than manually having now go to the learning path and add these courses you can just click on these buttons like let's say in here you're like okay I'm gonna do this course you can just click on add to path and then once you go in here you open is now going to be automatically inside of your learning path and now by default it's going to have no status so it's going to be in here and then you just add a status to it uh let's say okay this is next and then platform is going to be zero to Mastery Etc and now it's gonna be in here so that's like a cool feature that I was able to do in notion so there's a bunch of these roadmaps in here and more probably coming in the future now going into my tasks and productivity so this is probably going to be the thing that you interact with the most on a daily basis so first of all we've got a task manager in here what you can do in here is like basically any tasks relating to your learning or in your project you can just create new entries in here so for example in here we've got obviously finished cs50 week three you're gonna have a due date and then you can link to the course that it is related to which is really cool or link to the project that is related to if it's a project related task and then if you don't want to look at all of your tasks and every day you just want to look at what tasks do I have today that is why I have added these different views into today's agenda which is going to be on your home page so the I idea here is when you arrive inside of developers brains you're like first thing that you do in the morning you can open this toggle up and see today's task so this is filtered so that it only shows you the tasks that are due today so you can only okay right today I need to do these things and then you can just like laser focus on these things when you click on them it is going to disappear from The View so you can just like go through like I find this very satisfying just like going through different tasks and like checking them off and then like having a clean slate at the end of the day the other thing in here is some little review calendar and this is really cool and this is because I wanted to build developer's brain not only to like organize your life and things like this but to also like build in a lot of this productivity and learning strategies and techniques that are based on science that I've learned through the years and one of these strategies that's probably the most effective one out of all of them is something called spaced repetition so basically what it means that you want to be coming back to on regular intervals to topics that you have learned before if you want to retain them the problem with a lot of is that we sort of forget to do it and we sort of like neglect it so I built this review calendar specifically to automatically like build this in basically and go in here like there's a topic python multi threading this is important right and I want to come back to it and I want to review it three times because it turns out like three times a good amount of time to review it and basically you want to do it so that the first interval is like quite soon but the second time you review it doesn't have to be as soon but you don't want to be like manually trying to remember this because you're just not going to right so you can just add the date that you added this so I added this today June 25th and it's going to automatically give you the dates when you should be reviewing this topic and then the cool thing is is that once you've added in here you ideally don't need to look at this view when you just open up today's agenda inside of your home page it's now automatically gonna show up for you if like today is one of the dates when you should be reviewing it's gonna show up in here now currently we don't have any let's say this was added I think I need to put it like 23rd that would mean that the first review is today June the 25th now once I open this is gonna show up it's gonna tell me like right today I need to review python multi-threading so you don't need to manually try to remember this you can just automatically know it which is pretty cool next up we are moving on to the my projects happen so if you've spent any time listening to my videos my content my ramblings on YouTube you'll know that I am of the strong opinion that building projects is the most important part about learning code becoming a programmer and getting a job so that's why I've spent a lot of time like thinking about I want to not only allow you to organize your projects but also Aid you in like having the best practices in mind from the get-go when you are building projects so starting off here we have the project tracker which starts off with a similar view as for the courses where you can track your projects you can house any of your ideas so anytime you have an idea you can just go in here and create a new project idea and then once you start working on them you can move them in progress and then to complete it but this is is really not where a lot of the value is because when you create a new project let's say in here I'm going to create a project about like a tab manager for example then when you click on coding project template this is going to open up this kind of view in here where a lot of stuff is happening first of all we have a ticket board where you can essentially create tasks so what we call as tickets in the software development world around the things and the features that you want to build in the projects and like bugs that you want to fix and things like this so what you can do is create a new one like create UI then add all the same attributes that you could for the task manager before and there's a cool thing that happens here let's say we have a due date of the 25th party of number one now once I go back to my main views and to my task manager it actually comes up in here and it's automatically now linked to the project that it's related to so first of all you can just manage the tasks relating to Any Given project so when you're working on this tab manager project ideally what you'll have is this page is open for you like you have this page open at all times to house everything you need relating these projects you can work with the different tasks the different tickets that you want to make related to that project but then the next day when you come back and let's say you set up for today you wanted to create the UI for the project you go in here it also shows up in your general task manager so all of these tasks are still integrated into the same database so you don't have to then separately go to the project page or anything like that to find out what you had to do for that specific project in that given day which is pretty cool so that's the ticket board and here we have the GitHub repo so where you're going to be housing your code you can hear you just click on it and add the URL so then again every time you open up the project you can just open this one page and then from this one page you can go to the code you can go to the tasks you can go to a figma file that maybe has some of you your designs if you use figma your app architecture which actually like this comes in to the like things that you want to be doing when you're building at least like a slightly more complex project you want to actually do something to like design the architecture beforehand I use this app called figma and as you go into figma I would do something like this where I will like draw up the diagram of like the higher level architecture of how this project is going to work and there's like a really really important step in the beginning of building out a project so again instead of developers brain inside of this project base you can just link it so you don't have to like manually go and find it because if you do that you'll probably forget about it and things like this so everything will be linked in here same for the designs whatever you use figma if you use designs at all you might not need to if it's a simple project but all of this again it's going to be housed in the same page and again any other tutorial slash resources you find that are helpful for this particular project that you'll learn along the way you can add them in here for you to come back to late that by just clicking on it and then adding a page or if you have specific documents you can go slash PDF for example and that's going to allow you to embed a PDF from your computer to be housed in this project page and then I've got one last thing in here that's going to be helpful whenever you're starting another project if you turn on this toggle for different kinds of languages and Frameworks it's like a quick guide for you to get started let's say you're starting out a react project and you don't remember like the commands to start up a new project where you should do quick start just housed in here so you don't have the manual go look for it same for Django and I'm going to add more in here in OJs flask etc etc etc and just get started like that and start coding straight away so that is the project page and every time when you're creating a new project just by clicking on the coding project template you can basically start with the starting point every single time and if you want to customize any of these templates by the way what you can do is when you're creating a new page you can click on than clicking on this you can click on these three dots and then click on edit which is going to allow you to edit this template so now every time you open up a new page with this coding project template it's gonna have your template in it if there's something that you want to add something perhaps in here that's not right for you you can customize all of this very very easily using notion but that's not everything that you get with the project section because you also get 40 project ideas you go in here for different categories I've just added for you a bunch of different project ideas that are very good for example for your resume to Showcase your skills to employers and most importantly you do become better at programming the step-by-step instructions or like how to get started a bunch of ideas so like literally you don't have the excuse of not having project ideas to start with although obviously as always I recommend you actually pick your own project the last thing we have is the coding business idea framework so let's say you are actually interested in building a proper startup or maybe even not but you wanna like from the get a girl think about how could you build a project that actually has some potential to maybe become a software as a service business there's really a lot of things outside of the code like the code is not even the most important thing in that case so I've added this coding business idea framework that you can basically go through for every single one of your ideas and that's going to like explain to you like what you need and like give you the right framework to think about it from the style it's based on a lot of stuff I've learned from my business coach and my own experience of now working on like two different startups so I definitely recommend that you look at this every time you're working on a project so that's the projects Hub now going into my knowledge Hub and this is pretty simple so essentially this is like a categorized way for you to like house all of your notes around programming let's say you're learning JavaScript and you learn about the async functions thing about it is a really important topic but unless you like write down the things that you learn you're probably not going to remember it so you might want to every time you learn like an important thing you might just want to open up this nodes page and add a note to the relevant section by the way for any of these in notion if you go to the top right corner and you click on pin this page to your sidebar is then going to be saved as a shortcut on your notion workflow so in here you've got developer's brain inside of this favorites tab in here everything that you've added as a favorite is going to be in here you can see for me because the task manager and now my notes and dogs it says this is something that you want to come back to very very frequently instead of just always coming through the main window you might just want to add it to your sidebar in here so that's like a thing that you might want to do now relating to these notes and also relating these tasks instead of having you open up the notes page and add a note from here what you can do is if you're on this main page and just click on one of these buttons in here so create new notes if you just click on it it's automatically going to create you a page inside of this main notes database so now you can create the note and then add the tag from here let's say electron now it's automatic is gonna be inside of your nose so that's pretty cool same thing for tasks if you don't want to like open this up and a new tasks to make it as easy for you as possible you're just doing something you can just go in here and create new tasks which is then going to create the new task automatically inside of the database just like that so just like making everything as easy for you as possible I find it really really helps with productivity last but not least we have my career Hub so those of you who are serious about like getting a job as a developer there's a bunch of resources in here to help you basically first of all we've got a job applications tracker so if you open it up you can all of these if this is really important to you right now you applying for jobs you might want to just save it and pin it at the sidebar so you always have access to it from there but this has you can upload your current resume cover letter and portfolio so every time you're applying you just grab them from here very easily and then every company that you have applied to you can create a page in here uh let's say for Google you can set the priority of the job role the exact role that you've applied for the status of the application and when I was personally applying for jobs I had a very similar template like a Tracker that I used just like this in notion I end up with like 40 applications and eventually like one acceptance this is another thing that if you don't keep track of where you've applied to what companies you have scheduled interviews with what companies you have email to keep track of and maybe follow up is going to become very very overwhelming I think you're gonna add a type of the job uh the salary if they've listed there etc etc etc and going back inside of the career Hub we have this thing in here which is going to be super super helpful for those of you preparing for technical interviews if you're opening up where you can see first of all there's a sure guide on how to prepare for coding interviews in here with like again step by step what resources usually do everything like this but once you've gone through it once you don't need it anymore so you can just keep it toggled off and then what we have in here is there's the thing called the 75 blind lead code questions list that's like commonly accepted as the list of questions that you need to master if you want to get a job as a junior software engineer all you really need to do is Master these 75 questions because they go through the console like pretty much all the concepts that you would need to know so again just to like not be overwhelmed this one list is what you need to know there's a link to the original article but what I've done in here is first of all again there's a guide there's like a certain framework that I use that I don't have time to go through in this video but there's a link to an unlisted video on my channel where I go through like a very uh specific framework on how to approach all of these problems so that's going to be there that you can access by this toggle and then for all of these 75 questions that categorize based on what they are relating to we have the question itself that you can find by clicking on the link and then as you do them you enjoy check them off but the cool thing in here I've also added the solutions and by the way this degree is so long to do like this if you use this and some of these Solutions don't work just like send me an email or comment or whatever and I'm gonna go and fix it but they should all work they should also all be Optimal Solutions don't look at the solutions before you've properly tried them basically before you've probably follow this framework that I list out in here that you should be following for every single one of these problems after that at some point if you don't get it you can look at the solutions and understand them uh just like that last but not least we also have a software engineer resume templates so when it comes to building a resume there's no point in you trying to go and manually figure out like how to build a good resume because there's like so many small like things that you just don't want to spend time or like wow how much padding should you have like between sections like uh how should you order the sections like uh what color should you like all of these like not what we should be spending time on as professionals and software Engineers there's a couple of templates that just always work that are proven to work that I've used I've told my coaching clients to use and they just like look great you then don't have to think about ever so you can just focus on the content so in here I'm also gonna add like a full-on guide on how to make a great resume I realized I didn't add it in here yeah but then in here we've got this template that you can just access a couple of them on in Google Docs so you can just do it uh duplicate it and then build your resume based on that or if you prefer to use canva which I personally actually prefer again we've also got kind of a template for you that are a lot more like visual different ways so you can pick any of these just pick one stick to it and yeah got a couple of options for you that I get like proven to work like proven to like pause whatever screening software everything like this that you get access to as part of this so now that is the system that I've like basically from everything I know about learning programming everything I know about productivity about learning I've tried to build it all into this one system so you don't have to like jump between five different things like most people do whatever you do like you should have a system you should have some sort of system to house your project your learning your notes and like your talks basically and this is the sort of system that I wish I had from the very first day that I started learning code and now I've built it up into this one template um again it's based on notion uh what happens if you choose to purchase this is that you're gonna get this link and then in the right hand corner you're gonna be able to click on duplicate which you're gonna then bring it into your own notion and on that point like it's yours from that point and you can do whatever you want with it so that is that I hope it helps you scroll down below if you wanna check out this template and I will see you inside hopefully
