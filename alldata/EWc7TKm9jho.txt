it's not surprising you know that that this is what she's doing and you can understand that in some ways what she was doing in the 1970s and what she was doing back then is what would lead to things like cutting and self-harm in the modern world because cutting in self-harm is also a desire to participate it's a desire to re-engage the world right to reawaken our engagement with the world it's just a just a very deluded and deranged version which enters into this this sadomasochistic Paradigm that appears at the beginning of the Modern Age right it's like all I can understand the world to be is either a world of power in which I you know inflict pain and violence and and torture or I am the recipient of violence and pain and torture and if I can do that to myself then I am in like in control of the nihilism that I mean that I'm living in of the kind of dark uh world that I'm engaged with [Music] this is Jonathan Pedro welcome to the symbolic world [Applause] [Music] hello to all of you welcome to the symbolic world today we're going to talk about art I was really surprised to notice how many people watched my video on El Greco and Andy Warhol so I thought we will push it a little further and we'll look at contemporary artists like Maria bravic of pizza gate uh Fame and a few other contemporary artists and we'll look at how much of Contemporary Art or some Contemporary Art is yearning for participation look at how they come close to it and also how they struggle to break through and so uh as you notice a lot of things have been going on in the symbolic world we have a new website that you can sign up to there's a new community a bunch of of gifts even for people who sign up and as you can see I have behind me the beautiful Mosaic that was made by my carving assistant David and uh was designed by Heather paulington and so I'm surrounded by wonderful people really excited to carry on with symbolic world as we reach new levels so what we're going to look at is the question of Contemporary Art and how it it uh moves into extremes and moves towards participation but first what I wanted you to think about is many of the modern artists were in some ways in the what I call pendulum a pendulum of the Incarnation you could call it where on the one hand the art tends to move up towards ideal shapes towards idealism towards you know and it also tends to move down towards either popular art or common art or everyday representations this pendulum happens in many ways sometimes it's almost contradictory but nonetheless the pendulum is there and um and so here we're looking at an artist named brancusi many of you will know him and what's interesting about these artists is that if you look at what they're doing some of it you know who has written much about iconography has even suggested the possibility that you know there's something akin to icons in some of the modern movements if you look at the way the face is simplified this desire to kind of Define the basic geometry of the face and to represent it is something that Aiden sees happening in icons if you look at the difference between Roman art and Christian medieval art or iconographic art you get a sense that the iconographic art is more distilled it doesn't tend to show a lot of the excesses of the material world it tends to let's say Rectify or simplify the forms now this wasn't necessarily done with a the same drive as the modern artist that is really trying to almost reduce to an Essence uh but nonetheless there is something that you might want to see as Akin now this is true but it's interesting to think about how there is a in terms of moving towards an art of course of participation you have a basic issue which is going to be in some ways the development of the personal style and so as brancusi or other artists want to do this distilling they also at the same time end of creating things that are so you know particular to themselves that they you know that their their personality is impregnated completely on it and so it doesn't have a kind of universal appeal communal appeal that the traditional Arts would have like images and icons they do distill the forms but they do that in a way that is also calling to participation in a community whereas brancusi is creating artists of contemplation uh objects of contemplation objects of aesthetic pleasure uh that would be in people's houses or in buildings but don't necessarily have so much of that capacity to participate in a community another example is of course Kandinsky now many people have pointed Kandinsky out to me saying you know isn't Kandinsky something akin to what you're trying to do right he's trying to find the meaning and colors Kandinsky created this whole theory of color symbolism where each color represented certain moods certain states of human uh existence and then he created this almost symbolic language of colors in his paintings where he brought all these colors together you know contrasting with each other and uh and and existing together in order to bring about this kind of symbolic language of color and so there is something interesting about that once again in the way that my friend Aiden Hart uh points out that there's something of that in color in in icons where an icon certain colors have certain uh a certain importance in certain representations for example we represent the veil of the Virgin with a royal color you know we use gold we use white uh we use dark black and Darkness to manifest certain characteristics and so it's not as uh typified as in Kandinsky and it's not as typified as sometimes people want to think but there is definitely a basic symbolism of color that exists in the icons now once again the issue with Kandinsky and this of course happens also with people like Pete mondria is a is an artist who's trying to do something similar he was a theosophist and so you know a kind of a spiritualist in the in the early sense that it you know something akin to what a new Ager would be today and he tried to create these simple images of proportions mathematical proportions and and and Primal colors in order to create this kind of spiritual experience of the painting now what are the issues with with both of these is that for example with Kandinsky you have the problem that his forms and his colors create a very idiosyncratic language and so in the desire to actually create something which would be Universal devoid of cultural uh you know cultural hooks that it's not this or that person it's not this or that scene it's an it's a universal language what ends up happening is rather the opposite is that Kandinsky creates a language which is completely utosyncratic to himself and that you know unless you've read his book on color you would struggle to find any meaning in his paintings even in terms of Impressions The Impressions that his paintings create on the viewer are not really exactly what he would think they're doing with his whole very complex theory of color now the same happens with p is that you know although his mathematical proportions they are Universal they are very much uh once again void of the capacity to participate and so these images you look at them but what are they what are they doing what is happening with these images and what's important to understand in terms of the pendulum is to understand how in the early modern age and this is something which will be repeated early modernism not Modern Age to say at the beginning of the 20th century something which will be repeated over and over is that you end up having movements of artists that represent things that look very similar to each other but for app completely opposite reasons this happened especially in Russia so in Russia you had two movements you had a movement that you could call supremacism uh you see this in malovich of course malovich who is kind of continuing kandinsky's line of representing these pure mathematical forms these pure shapes these pure colors on on canvases in order to create a supreme uh you know kind of platonic experience of the forms in the paintings um and so there was almost like a spiritualism which is devoid of body and you see that of course in multi as well you know it's trying to create these pure patterns pure patterns that are that are are are spiritual but that don't land that don't incarnate in in the world the way patterns actually usually incarnate in the world right you don't perceive mathematical proportions you perceive them you know if you look at the golden mean for example you know the golden mean appears as different proportions the proportions of the body the proportions of buildings you know that that are participated in you enter into the building and the fact that your body is made of certain proportions connects with the proportions of the church and so there might be a little bit of that in the painting but the painting is something that you stand in front of and you look at that weird activity of just visual uh experience uh is something which is not integrated with other aspects of reality so now what's interesting about Russian supremacism is that it gives birth to a movement that is its opposite which is called constructivism and the constructivists are also using these geometric shapes but they're using them in a almost reductionist manner in a Marxist way so on the one hand you have this kind of idealism this this High spiritualism in the supremacist and now this this landed very very practical uh use in constructivism now you look at this and you would you might think okay so what's the difference right what's the difference between this which is constructivism and this which is supremacism and that's my point my point is that you know these extremes manifest manifest themselves in a very surprising way where people on the one hand someone who wants to create idealistic spiritual forms and the other person who wants to create Marxist working class you know reductionist objects that are made of real things you know that are that are completely material in there for the even the reason of their being will end up making something similar and so for the same reason what you end up seeing is the constructivists end up using the tools of modernism and the the design tools of simple geometric forms in order to create propaganda whereas something like creating propaganda out of a out of abstract geometric forms is something that the supremacist like malovich would have found completely abhorrent and the total opposite of what it is they're trying to do now this of course will continue on into the the uh the Modern Age and when you get to the 1960s and 70s you have the exact same problem in the United States and in Europe as well you end up having two movements one which is called conceptual art and the other which is called minimalism and what happens is you have these two extremes and so conceptual art uh you know this this is you know this is supposed to be very smart so Joseph kosuth you know he puts a chair in the gallery and then puts a picture of the chair and and then puts the definition of the chair to kind of help you understand that you know how these objects are actually ideas and that the idea is what is more important than the physical instantiation of the object and so you know it's super interesting because this is a very very uh boring thing it's a very boring statement and it's also a cold clinical action that you know is supposed to create just this reflection on on the relationship between different representations of an idea in the world and different uh you know putting putting out there in terms of uh of uh the creation of an art object right because this is the problem now this chair you know is not is not an actual chair right it's not a it's not a chair that you sit on it's a fetishized chair that is used in the gallery in order to to create a artistic experience I guess and so although and so again you have this problem of the alienation which the art object uh end up creating in the in the world and so you and then you end up having all these tropes of trying to kind of Break Free Break through the issue that that the gallery space provides and you know the Art Space provides uh the most extreme version of this kind of conceptual art that is trying to be revolutionary if you remember my last lecture on uh on El Greco and in your Warhol is of course Piero manzoni who did the you can read it for yourself he created uh cans of art that contained his own uh excrement um and we don't even know if they really did but that was the point the point is to have these cans that contain the X-Men of the artist and put them in the gallery who's kind of taking dushan's gesture to an extreme uh but manzoni did all kinds of things like that where he would he would take a vial of glass and fill it with air in Paris you know just have a vial of glass open in pairs close it and then show it all over the world and call it you know air from Paris or something uh it was this desire to to kind of expose in some ways it's almost the very mechanisms of Art and the Very mechanisms of how of how art is a a a fetishized representation of something that has lost its purpose so it's not clear exactly what his point was in the sense that is he denouncing it is he participating it maybe he's doing both at the same time you know but he can perceive the problem of participation and the problem of the space the Art Space itself as this strange space where we put put things there in order for us to just look at them and they don't have a kind of integration into into the the world and so this conceptual artist this can high high conceptual art well at the same time exist with other artists that are doing what we call minimalist art and here we're looking at pure reductionism so if you look at an abstract painting by uh Frank Stella for example and so you know abstract lines on a on a canvas and it might make you think that this has more to do with Mount itch but someone like Frank Stella would be the very opposite of malovich he would say that my paintings are just paint on a Surface that's all they are they have no meaning they have nothing except for just being paint on a Surface now obviously you know at this point hopefully everybody can understand that this is a of course a ridiculous gesture it's a ridiculous yes you're to think that you can have just paint on a canvas the whole question of relevance and and and and of wondering why I would care about paint on a canvas and not care about paint on a wall or not care about you know whatever it is is of course re-engaging and is a kind of strange uh almost blind spot of an artist like Frank Stella where you know the the putting in the gallery of this canvas with abstract painted lines on it cannot avoid entering into the whole question of meaning of prestige and of relevance and a question of culture and why we would have these objects that we Elevate above other objects and that we see as being kind of uh fetishized as culture as culture objects rather than just everyday common day objects and so you know you can see how the pendulum calls it's each other right the pendulum just just calls one extreme to the other and sometimes even in the same object and so without the whole uh structure of art the whole structure of of culture and this whole idea of these objects of contemplation and and that are fetishized and put above common day objects almost in a religious way Frank Stella could not be making his paintings and so even though he makes it reductionist move the very fact that we care about his reductionist move you know makes his art participate in The Other Extreme all the time and you see the same thing with any of the minimalist artists uh here more examples Carl Andre Donald Judd who created these simple materials they would just create these forms uh and you know the Donald judge boxes are made out of plywood they're made out of very common materials and put up in galleys in a very simple way uh in a very reductionist gesture once again you know there is very difficult for them to avoid this pendulum now one of the things that happened and it's interesting to start thinking about is that there is in the 1960s especially and it's then in the 1970s you have almost like a breakout where I think many of the artists starting to realize just how sterile a lot of this abstract art would be coming this conceptual art these minimalists are how sterile and and just uh because they fetishized in the weirdest way that these objects started to be coming and so what you have is artists that almost tried to start to break out and uh in that group you have um performance artists who start to use art almost in a ritual fashion this is what I mean by the the question of ritualization so this is Joseph Boyce uh Joseph Boyce was a airplane pilot in World War II and his plane crashed and he has a whole story about what happened to him and so his art tends to deal with these issues right with the issues of the of the war the issues of survival the issues of the human person put in contact with animality um and so some of it is a little simplistic because it's almost like his own uh process of healing through what he went you know like the felt blanket that he would have had in the military the sled a flashlight you know there's a sense in which he's creating these spaces that are that are just putting things together in a way that is let's say remembering participation right so it's the object in the gallery is obviously just fetishized like all the other art objects but because he's trying to bring about a memory of the war a memory of you know how these objects participated in his own life then there's something going on now we're going to get back to Joseph's boys but first the most famous of the uh performance artists especially right now is of course Marina Abramovich and uh and it's interesting to think about her and her work in which she was trying to do because in some ways you know she was also trying to kind of break through the problem of art art especially you know represented as here's the art and here's the public and now we go in and we are these passive these passive almost uh you know consumers and we just look at these art objects and there's no form of connection to the world and to life and so what she was trying to do you know she was trying to do a lot of things but one of the things she seems to be trying to do is to try to break to break through that that problem so she did very strange performances or one of her most famous performance is uh is shown here where Marina uh around which stood in a gallery for six hours and she put on a table a bunch of objects and all those objects were objects that a certain amount of people in the space with her were allowed to use on her and so you had feathers you had paper string you could kind of see but you also had more dangerous objects like a gun Like a Knife um and she just stood there for six hours she wasn't allowed to react but she just had to take it and then everybody in the gallery was allowed to do whatever they want they were absolved of any responsibility legally of course probably some of this is quite staged you know I don't want to question her method um but of course as you can imagine the situation starts very likely and then accelerates and it ends in moments where you know she's very much in Danger wearing a knight is used on her uh you know there's a she's stripped she's put on the table you know all these things that are happening to her you know someone's you know kind of threatens her with a knife and so in the end someone tries pulls the gun out and then someone reaches me God takes the gun away uh and so you know it's like intensity a nice Hollywood movie um but what what it seems like she's trying to do is trying to break through the problem of of this passive relationship to the art object now she's doing it obviously in a very modern way she's doing it in a way which tends to reduce human no she now becomes the passive and the viewer becomes active and the whole relationship is one which seems to be framed on the possibility of sadism and a kind of passive masochism and so of course the the the the relationship that she brings about is a very tortuous modern relationship but she's trying to bring back you could say something like the stakes like the stakes of art like what are we doing imagine a in the ancient world where you build a church and people would go and worship and there would be these rallots would be taken into the church and people would light candles you know uh and then uh people would people when they were angry at uh at the king or whatever they would deface the statue and there was this whole relationship of of art which was seen as participative and connected to to life and so it seemed like she is trying to re-engage that in a very uh perverse way but nonetheless you can see that there's a sense that there's despair in the art world that that we realize that this is a problem what are what are these paintings like what is you know there's nothing wrong with decorating decorative art but is that what it is is that all these paintings uh are are I don't most of the modern artists don't think so they think they're doing something extremely important but in the end these art objects end up just being passive uh objects to look at you know to trade to exchange to to make money off of and so artists like her try to break that with this type of activity and so she's famously known for doing all kinds of weird things you know here's a performance where she holding a bow and her friend is pulling on the arrow and for six minutes he just holds the arrow stretched out and if he would let go she would die of course the arrow would go into her heart um and so it's all about again the same weird problem of how to represent a kind of uh uh you know and this is not just entertainment right this is not just a performance in the sense of uh of the play right or the ballet or something that is without stake that it's just people doing things and we watch it and we go home there's a sense in which she's putting yourself in danger while she is creating this this performance uh of course you know as like I said before the relationship seems to be reduced to a kind of state of masochism uh and which is very close you know it's funny people don't realize to what extent uh masochism is related to modernism and to what extent in the enlightenment at the birth of the Enlightenment appears both characters right the two Originators of what we could call sadism and masochism because there is already a problem once the Enlightenment and its pendulum starts to swing you can see the the first fruits of that in this reduction of relationships on the idea of acting purely on someone right being the complete actor where the other person is a complete passive uh puppet for your desires and on the on the other hand the opposite of becoming that pure puppet for someone else's desires of just becoming a passive recipient of other people's desires and violence that that is something which would inevitably happen at the birth of modernism and so Marina whether she knows it or not is putting on the scene this relationship this kind of weird sadomasochist relationship that the modern world has in a desire to re-engage re-engage the stakes of Art and re-engage I think it kind of participation at least at least the stakes you know of Art and so much of her art is is and so she became very famous because she's ditched and weird and stuff now this is one of her performances where she just sits in a galley space with a bunch of cow bones and she spends six hours a day or eight hours a day whatever trying to wash the blood from the bones that's all she did she would sit in the gallery and she would just try to wash the blood off the bones for hours that he creates again it's very dark image of what it is to be human what it is to participate you know is that is that what human life is right is that what human life is to try to wash the blood off of Bones right the imagery is quite Stark and it is quite uh you know it's actually a very good image of what contemporary life is and what the Contemporary world is this is what the world of participation in the modern world the analogy or the metaphor for for participation is now she got herself in in a lot of trouble in the last few years because she did a lot of weirdest stuff things that are closer to the occult things that are closer to rituals now you can understand whether she's sincere or not like whether or not she's doing it on purpose or not how what she's doing is coming closer to resembling rituals because intuitively we understand that ritualization is a form of participation which is closer to the way that we understand art what art is that is it's a reduction of the world the compression of the world into into a kind of dance a kind of ordered gesture uh ordered object making uh reductive object we compress things into images we compress you know the cup that is used in the Liturgy is it kind of compressed cups like it's a couple of Cups right it's a ritualized cup it's not just the cup you use every day but it is but it is a a condensation of cup so there's a there's a inevitable almost sense that what will happen is is as there's this desire to break out of the of the just the passive relationship to Art things that people are doing these performance artists will often start to look like ritual now whether they themselves conceive what they're doing as rituals nonetheless it's participating in the same Aesthetics and there's there's no surprise that the rituals that they will engage with will be rituals which will reflect the sickness of the modern world you know and so she got of course also into a lot of trouble with with these these performances she did where they were that were Spirit cooking or whatever you know she's done a lot of things she would write up all these absurd recipes that look like magical formulas using human fluids and stuff mixed together in order to create uh food and she did she does a lot of things with pain where she would film herself just you know putting her hand over a candle or whatever and just burning herself you know I mean it's it's not surprising you know that that this is what what she's doing and you can understand that in some ways what she was doing in the 1970s and which she was doing uh back then is what would lead to things like cutting and self-harm in the modern world because cutting in self-harm is is also a desire of to participate it's a desire to re-engage the world right to reawaken uh our our engagement with the world it's just a just a very deluded and deranged version which enters into this this sadomasochist the Paradigm that appears at the beginning of the Modern Age right it's like all I can understand the world to be is either a world of power in which I you know inflict pain and violence and and torture or I am the recipient of violence and pain and torture and if I can do that to myself then I am in like in control of the nihilism that I mean that I'm living in right of the of the kind of dark uh world that I'm engaged with um so you can kind of understand why this is happening it doesn't reduce from how dark it is but of course the the most important um to me the most important thing that Marina did recently that kind of shows us an image of of the modern world and what is going on is the event she did at the at the Museum uh of Modern Art in La I think that's where it is and so she did this performance with the singer Blondie of all people where you know now we had a full-on scale desire to re-engage participation and so she did a created and an art event which was also eating you know and so remember all the things that I've said about that you know eating as an active participation and communion especially as the kind of highest ritual Act and the highest active participation but that is a form of ritualized eating because eating is so close to our you know our engagement with the world and so now what she does is she creates a a feast of eating and I'm not going to show you uh all the pictures because they're quite disturbing uh you know where she engages all the tropes of cannibalism you know and all the tropes of uh of human sacrifice into her event so she had these cakes made of herself and of the Blondie singer and the cakes came in on these tables and now with a knife they stabbed them and cut them and cut pieces and handed pieces of their of their cake to the people and you can see how it's a parody of course obviously of communion a parody of of uh the Lord's Supper but done in a kind of uh dark carnivalesque way but that is nonetheless right trying to like in their own perverted disturbing way trying to re break through the problem of the passivity of the art of the art object the passivity of of the of the entertainment culture and of representation culture and so during the event on the tables they had actors artists who just stuck their head through the table and their their heads were like the centerpiece almost like in like a pig with it in his mouth in the middle of the table as people were eating they were just sit there and stare blankly and they had you know naked women lying on tables with like skeletons on them and you know just very dark and disturbing things right and so close to ritualization that of course you know during the night to 2016 kind of uh frenetic thing around pizzagate uh people started seeing these images and freaking out and the thing is with good reason you know it's so funny that someone like her engages with tropes of occult cannibalism all these very very dark images and then defends herself and says you know oh I'm just an artist this is just art but her whole project is about breaking through the just art like breaking through the idea that artists are just like innocent people who represent things that she's trying to break through she's trying to re-engage she's trying to use images of her own self-harm and her own uh you know doing all these these very dark uh disturbing gestures and then she's surprised when it breaks out and then people react in a way that links it to the very things that she's using as her Source material in her order to create these things and so whether an action is an actual Satanist or an occultist like I've said off often in these videos it's like I don't have access to that and to be honest I don't care but the the the the the truth that she's using are those if you use tropes of cannibalism and you use tropes of human sacrifice and you you use tropes that are that are that are magical spells and magical formulas in your recipes and whatever then don't be surprised if people react to that as if that's what you're doing it's just funny to see how she she that then she tried to play the victim and you can see there's all these articles you can find them online where she's playing the victims like oh stop harassing me I'm just an artist you know uh all these conspiracy theorists that are saying that I'm doing these dark things well you are doing these dark things uh you might not take it seriously maybe you're just doing it you know to be an artist whatever that means but the like I said the tropes you're engaging uh those are the tropes those are the tropes so you know obviously I don't want people to harass her or whatever I wouldn't want I don't want that to happen but you know nonetheless this is what is this is what is going on in your work now one of the things I want to do is return to Joseph Boyce uh because Joseph boys you know understood what he was doing very much as ritual and and he was almost using kind of shamanistic uh shamanistic thing he did these performances where he would lock himself in in a room with uh with like Wool with a wolf and he wore this felt blanket and would like engage with uh with the wolf in certain ways uh and was trying to almost create these rituals and one of the problems that where they were trying to deal with these artists was of course World War II and you know Joseph Boyce was a German artist how to deal with the scandal of World War II how to break through the guilt and the shame and the the guilt you know the all the things that happened that he did as a soldier that Germans did uh and so trying to create these almost rituals of atonement in order to get through that and so he did all kinds of stuff uh you know uh kind of absurdist things now of course the problem with this is is the same problem as with Kandinsky is that you can totally understand the desire to re-engage rituality you can totally understand the the desire to also feel like there's no way to atone for the sins of your people for your own sins and try to create rituals of atonement and of transformation about but when you do it in a gallery and you do it you know in a space that is just there to to hold art objects when you do it in a language that becomes so idiosyncratic that nobody can participate it except for you that people are looking at you ripping up pieces of paper and you know writing on billboards and skinning a hair like you did all kinds of stuff uh you know playing the piano absurdly uh that you you might think that you're kind of doing something that's breaking through but ultimately this will remain with you right it it will not become a true language of a participation another artist that I personally enjoy and like I said it's just because each of these artists has a little hint that there's a desire to move away from a kind of finishization and and and of the of Art and a you know and the kind of meaningless not meaninglessness but you know this idea of Art For Art's Sake that this pure art that just exists uh is is an artist called and some Kiefer so Ansel Kiefer did things that were similar to what Joseph Boyce was doing um and but his whole uh let's say theme is about the possibility of using art as a a kind of medicine where the representation of the images could take let's say culture and break it down or bring it down uh into the dark place and then try to have it rise back up and so you know he would represent some of these Nazi uh Nazi building there's not the architecture and would cover it with tar would would try would cover it with like all with uh actual material not just paint you know he would he would have Ash and he would put sand and and straw and all these things on the paintings and would you know and and trying to in some ways you know re-baptize or or refound these buildings that are there right what do you do now you have these Nazi buildings that are there in Berlin or in other places in Germany and how do you get through this like do you destroy them do you do you just get rid of them and so his sense is that there's a kind of deep duplicity in his art where he he is trying in some ways to recast uh very uh with a hesitation these objects and almost trying to act like a kind of traditional healer and heal these art objects now once you understand that what he's doing his art the key to his art opens up very simply he represents you know these lead wings or sometimes you represent a lead artist uh palette painter's palette that will be stuck on top of his of his uh images he represent airplanes sometimes War airplanes as this dual symbol of something which is both dark but Also Rises up and so there's this ambiguity about his work and but the ambiguity seemed to be wanting to kind of push through and to to to to break through the problem of modernism and the problem of World War II um the iconology that he uses is actually quite uh it's a little simplistic you know it's a little it's a little over the top so here's a simple example right he a man lying on his back and then out of him is coming this thing a flower uh uh you know a kind of stream and this is going up now becoming a flower that dies and the seeds now fall back on the earth and so you can kind of see this cycle of death and rebirth that he's trying to show in the image here this is actually the Louvre um you can see that there's a bunch of books right and the books are kind of stacked and and piled and they they're made of lead and so they're dead you know in some ways they're kind of like the problem of uh you know I talk about this the problem of culture and the problem of uh the problem of uh of art as this supplement as this kind of dark aspect to culture in general and so he gets that um and then he shows out of it you know a nonetheless kind of letting fly hours so if you had seen this in person the very center of these dead flower is gilded it has gold on it and then a few of the seeds that have fallen back onto the trees onto the books are also golden and so a lot of it is lead and if you have this kind of little hope piercing through right this dead this dead culture see the same uh you know in this image as well so the sunflower comes up and then the sunflower drops its seeds back onto the ground and you hope that some of it will be reborn the sunflower seeds are also stars in his kind of imagination you can understand you know here is something like the Milky Way uh this idea of like the principalities coming up and then acting back upon us you know so there's something about his work which is obviously a little kitschy a little new agey a little simplistic and it's uh in its kind of basic um imagery something that you might find in a kind of second-rate Union type of thing but the desire to represent this this kind of decadence and this breakdown of culture and the weight of history and how you know in this death that there might be something that is reborn I think is a desire and a hope that for sure I share and and so I do find some resonance in in his work in that sense and I think that understanding that is something that has pushed me towards some of the things that I'm doing now the problem of course with keeper and just like the problem with Joseph Boyce or the problem with uh Marina bromovic is that the spaces in which they create these things they are artificial spaces themselves right the museum the gallery the these are are kind of fetishized spaces they aren't spaces of they aren't the Public Square they aren't the church they aren't the the Civic buildings they aren't the things that we kind of recognize as holding our identity holding our participation um and and although the artist you know created these Gallery spaces not the artists but first the art dealers created these spaces just for art in order to sell art and those those spaces became uh you know like just places to see art and to to to visualize it um is the desire to break through now I don't think they succeed I don't think they succeed because they're trapped inside the art world they're trapped inside a weird like keeper for example his his paintings are very much on the Art Market they're they're objects of speculation for for our dealers and art collectors you know uh and so just like all the other artists he probably manages how many pieces he puts out in the market you know calculates his moves in order to make sure to make the the best killing in terms of selling all of these things are inevitable in the in the art World um and then collectors will uh let's say want to see shows by this artist in order to make their collection be worth more so there's this strange uh this whole strange things in which they participate and the same thing with Marina Abramovich you know she's she she has these this this Art Foundation and then she has it funded by these Elites in order to make performance art that exists only within the space of the art is the space of art uh and doesn't really land right it doesn't it doesn't turn into folk dances it doesn't turn in to things that people imitate uh and in some way she probably doesn't even want that to happen because she she doesn't totally understand the way that patterns embody themselves in the world and so but what you can see is at least the desire to kind of break through and I think that once you see that you can understand why you know there are ways to do it you know that there's a uh a possibility of re-engaging and you know at least in my vision it starts with liturgical art because the liturgical space the church is still a true space of participation it is not although in some Churches in Europe it has become a fetishized museum most churches at least are still and sometimes the ones that are the least beautiful or that aren't as beautiful as the great Cathedrals for example are our spaces of true participation and so the possibility of creating objects within that that world you know can anchor them in terms of their beauty but then also in terms of the participation now in order to give you a bit of hope it's not like these Contemporary Art movements were the only movements to exist in the modern world there were movements that try to also integrate the different forms so there are art movements that try to you know resist this fetishization that happened in the in the modern world you know uh you can see that of course in in movements like uh the arts and craft movements and also our Nouveau which try to link you know the the architectural the object print making that tried to kind of integrate that into the into the world now I think that the arts and craft movement and our Nouveau succeeded much more than the modern artists in avoiding the extremes now of course one of the issues with with the arts and craft movement and our Nouveau is there was nonetheless this kind of um how can I say this there was a a lack of of anchoring a little bit in terms of form you know there was a Fantastical movement especially our Nouveau where we kind of moved over these Fantastical shapes that moved into extremes and it were very hard to embody in the long term for example so it's not surprising that our Nouveau was like a flash that really tried to integrate but then didn't really succeed in the end and ended up kind of falling apart and also because they there was so much emphasis on ornament you know you see that with William Morris and the and some of the arts and craft people there was so much beautiful ornamentation you can see that you know in the uh you can see that in these Interiors for example where there's a there's a rich use of fabric I want a mutation trying to kind of integrate these things into the common life Beauty into the common world so not just Beauty for beauty sake but but Beauty in a chair Beauty in a beauty in a in a curtain in something that is part of the everyday life um and so you know there's still some of that people can still kind of hold on to that a little bit but uh there was such a there was such a kind of access you could say in the in the Aesthetics in terms of I mean here it's like gilded peacocks on the wall you know this type of gilded surfaces and extremely uh you know designed surfaces are things that maybe should be reserved for civic spaces for um for churches but of course because Art Nouveau was a modern movement it got focused on homes and you know it's okay for your home to be beautiful but if you push it too much and you create these excessively lavish homes that aren't for a king for example that are that are trying to be a model for the way in which we exist it's going to be difficult to kind of hold on to that but there are some things from these movements that we can nonetheless capture and a kind of vision in order to think differently about how art participates in life and to understand that you know the possibility of integrating Beauty into the everyday into the everyday object is something which is not uh is not impossible because the the Arts and Crafts movement and the art removal movement was able to make beautiful lands beautiful pots beautiful you know different objects of just participation uh in the world and so there is a bit of access and so you can understand why you know the modernist tend to think that because of industrial um the industrial process that these types of ornamentation have become impossible that we should really you know move towards uh you know a kind of uh simple simple simple uh geometric forms so hopefully this was just a bit of fun for you to kind of understand and see that the not only does the modern world and modern art really emphasize these extremes often this pendulum of abstraction you know high high attraction but then also materialist varying reductionist concerns but that there were desires and there's artists that tried to break through you know this just passive weird uh art object tried to re-engage participation but would often do it in a way that would nonetheless re-engage these extremes extremes of idiosyncrasy extremes of of uh of sadism and masochism into terms in the case of Abramovich um you know and and create these obscure languages that nobody understood although there are some like and some keeper that I show you who were re-engaging images that you could recognize right the wing uh artists palette a human body these things trying to be reintegrated a little kitschy maybe a little new agey uh but but at least you can perceive the desire right this desire to break through and uh ultimately I do think that uh that liturgical art is the way out at least for you know not to become a famous artist and to become a and to become known and to be shown in magazines or whatever and in in different uh Publications but but in order to really participate in in a community Beauty making meaning making within the community uh this seems to be at least the anchor of a way outfit so thanks everybody for your attention I hope you enjoyed it um and uh I will talk to you very soon
