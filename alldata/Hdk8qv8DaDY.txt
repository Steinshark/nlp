ladies and gentlemen in this video I recorded a roughly 40-minute interview with Grandmaster hikara Nakamura where we talked about a wide range of subjects and topics and we discussed anything and everything this interview was recorded the day before the candidate started so it was on April 3rd 2024 I'm uploading this probably on April 28th or 29th and so obviously the world has changed a bit since that uh we since we recorded this interview uh and I'm obviously right now in Amsterdam in case the background looks different uh but I will be back home very very soon in the meantime enjoy this interview hi I'm Gotham chess and I'm here with Grandmaster Hikaru yeah speaking of Hikaru can we uh just start on that note um I want to know your like 100% opinion so like no BS no clips out of context do you think I have what it takes to be a grandm um in terms of general knowledge absolutely uh I think one thing that's very tricky though is the mental aspect and a lot of people don't understand how important of a role that plays um and I think for you you're uh you need to use that sh mentality the personality the fact that I think people are in a you to your advantage I don't think you do that enough I think you're too you have too many doubts and mentally you're sort of you're you're not quite there so it's possible but I would also say it's much more difficult now than say 10 years ago when you were up and coming kids are much better so many more resources and the openings probably you played back then they're just they're not as sharp and they're not as Cutting Edge as they were back then so it' be tough but uh in general yes you do have the ability it does seem like nowadays you have to learn the main stuff you have to learn E5 C5 the pawns don't go on the sixth rank anymore like you can't really and with white you have to be flexible and you have to just yeah I think you have to be a more Universal player now than in the past I I think when I look back to becoming a grand master I would say probably 90% of the games I played were just nidor I played Sicilian nidorf that was about it um with white I I mean I did play E4 and D4 but for example I did not play the English at all um so my repertoire was much much uh narrower back then and I think that now you have to basically play everything it's just a completely different ball game than it was back then let me give you another example so when I was growing up and of course this also is completely different but when I grew up playing on the internet chess club um I played even less openings back then but I would play Blitz Games I'd play my main openings and after the games would finish or after I played for like 5 hours I'd go download the games look at them in chess space and figure out where I made mistakes and that was very very beneficial but nowadays all the games were saved so if you play on chess.com first of all you can download them but also when you play in title Tuesday or other events they're out there for everybody to see so like that's one way that I learned a lot um and it just it's not applicable in the modern world it just doesn't work CU everybody will see your games and and there's no benefit to it so it's almost like you have to hide your openings and find a way to uh play better unless I guess you want to be like CR can play on a random account in title Tuesday yeah uh that's a that's a good good segue the whole karnick Saga is is super weird uh you're a you're a top player you're obviously an Insider so you're privy to certain conversations that go on behind the scenes but I'll tell you my perspective uh obviously karnick is a legend of the game so growing up I knew of his match with Kasparov I knew of I think people at some point some interviews said like karnick made more inputs to Modern Theory than like almost anybody MH uh that was something that I read then he had the candidates tournament where he had he was just on a crusade in the in the postmortem where he was leading but then all his postmortem were like no I was completely venan and like you know then there's the very funny clip of ding like you know he karnick talks for two minutes and she looks at Ding and goes do you agree and ding's like no it's just like and now you know we have we have kind of modern day karnick and what was weird in the beginning is that I think just like anything in life nothing is 100% one way or another you know I listen to cnick and listen I play 2400s on ches atcom and I'm like they're cheating like there's just no way right because if I played that 2400 and3 I would crush them I'm 27 2800 Blitz and in title Tuesday they're crushing me and it's a really weird feeling and so I have to sit there and go is it the 3 plus one like is it really that one second of increment that increases the level so much I don't know so as a spectator my karnick journey was okay he makes some Fair points but I don't agree with everything but here we are sitting it's April 3rd uh 2024 and just a couple of hours ago chess.com put out that based on the essentially the content and the findings of this YouTuber whose name is galchenko yeah basically like discovered that karnick was logging into uh Dennis kulan chess.com account and playing games pretending to be him yeah I mean I think uh it's I think there the problem in general I would say with account sharing or or various forms of cheating is they're all somewhat different and um you know for example like if Magnus were to log on on a random account and play some C games not right that's not right it's not it's not right but it's not really it doesn't really have any Major Impact overall I would say whereas when you start doing that in a prize money event it's completely different for many reasons first of all because potentially you're robbing people of a chance to earn money but then secondly and this is where I find the thing whole whole thing very very strange is that with kramnick he's he's saying you play on account which is similar similar rating to your own and that's missing the first of all it's missing the whole psychological point of view so for example if Magnus could play on a random account or I could play on a random account in a title Tuesday I'm pretty sure we would actually score much better than we do because people would not be giving us respect they would not be as focused whatsoever and they'd play completely differently stylistically um and so when when KCK talks about the rating sure maybe the rating is roughly the same as that of his Mulan but uh the quality of play is completely different karnick of course former world champion great player his matulin very strong by the way not not a weak player by any stretch of the imagination but not on that same level and so from the psychological standpoint the respect that is afforded to karnick playing on his main account and how serious people are going to be about it is completely different so I I found it very odd that he seemed to insinuate that he hasn't done anything wrong or he's gaining research or methods uh I just I I really I don't think anybody should stand for that especially when potentially you're robbing people of the opportunity to earn a living from a tournament like title Tuesday yeah I I suppose I like to sometimes internally play Devil's Advocate in these situations and sort of say well you know let's say karnick uh didn't actually win any money in these events uh was it really that heinous and that serious of an infraction of course it's against the rules and you should get in trouble like no question uh but more than anything it was just weird like did he do it because he wanted to see whether people cheat more against him was that the approach or well I mean obviously obviously neither of us knows exactly what was in his mind but I I think um probably he's working from a certain truth in his mind which is that people people cheat more against him I mean I think that's that's very clear that he thinks that people cheat more against him than anybody else um and so I think he thoughts he plays on a random account he'll see whether he scores better or scores worse and no harm no foul but again uh I really think that that misses the point because the fact of the matter is that the results are going to be completely tainted because when someone knows they're playing against myself or karnick or Magnus or wh what whomever it is uh they're going to play differently than if they think they're playing as a random 2600 GM there's just no doubt about that and like I I would give another example so i' played this guy Kar Nicholas Theodor a lot online and I can tell when I play against him he's really excited he's he's up for the games he he wants to play his best chess and then I see him play some other random like 2900 guy and he's playing horrible chess now it's not because he's cheating it's because the fact is he's much more motivated to play against me than he is to play against just a you know random grandm so I think uh in general kik's working with a bias and I mean I think the bias is wrong to begin with but he's working with that as the truth to begin with and I think that's the reason he did it you know you've definitely had to go through this process I've had to go through this process over the last few years but I'd like for you to elaborate a little bit more on it cuz you're you're obviously an elite player I would say that of all the top 10 top 20 grand masters of the last 10 15 years you have played online more than any of them it's probably not even close like maybe Jan is second I don't know I don't even know who play pro him or maybe mvl mvl played a lot some years back but you've definitely had to go through the process of going like online and offline is very different and also the online strength might not even reflect the over theboard strength right like you've definitely played against people and you've been like there's no way this guy's this good like he's not playing fairly but you've had to adapt over the last few years to go no there really is a chance and like the over theboard will so can you just speak about that a little bit because I've had that yeah I I mean so I think to start with the first time that I started feeling like I'm going to talk about I'm talking about over the board here very specifically um was around 2018 up to that point I would say roughly like when I started playing the top level events and also strong opens to around like 200 10 till about 2018 I did very well like jalter for example I won that turn I think five times I was very good at beating lower rated players um with with white or black even and it wasn't really much of a struggle I would say but around 2017 2018 is it became much harder and I think it was a 2018 event at jalter where um I drew my first game with black against somebody who I think was like 25 200ish maybe a little bit below and then second game I've whiteed against is 2480 I am from Spain and I played a Catalan line and he played like 25 moves perfect chess couldn't get anything game was a draw and this was me as like a 2770 player playing as someone was 2480 and so for over the board sometime around then I felt this big shift where it wasn't as easy to beat the low rated players I think that's also played a large part um in terms of the rating deflation that we've seen where top players when they play Swiss events they tend to lose a lot of rating points just it seems to be natural now you just can't beat the lower rated players the way you once could so I would say around that times when I first had this realization that players who are lower rated are playing better than you you would kind of expect or I would expect based on my history of the previous decade um so now if we fast forward to online I think that online had its big moment during the pandemic around 2019 2020 when sort of first of all everybody was stuck at home so people did not have the chance to play over the board they had to play online and when people had to play online that meant that everybody was playing and it became sort of the hip thing to do obviously you kind of were forced to do it because there were no tournaments but everybody was playing online I think that changed the perception a lot because prior to that it wasn't viewed as something super important like you just go online play some Blitz games for fun no real money tournaments none of these things existed back then um so the world changed and I think because of that once it became the standard where these kids were playing online all the time everybody's level increased immensely and frankly I would say that chess unfortunately if you don't happen to come from very privileged background it's very hard to play tournaments having to spend money traveling hotel rooms uh paying entry fees in many cases not winning prize money even if you do well it's just it's very cost prohibitive um especially for like the parents of these young kids so when they go online and they start playing over and over and over again they actually get to a much higher level um than you see reflected in their over theboard the rating or if they've even played over theboard to begin with um and so I think that's one of those things that I've had to really uh get used to because again and like before 2018 even over the board it's like all these kids are weak whatever you can win games um but I've also seen it in a lot of the kids that I've played against over the years so for example if you look at buddy Prav from India um I think his first name is I think it's V I don't I don't know exactly what it is um technically I also don't remember isn't it Prav Anand is it V I think that's a different PR I think it's a different one I think there are a couple of them oh yeah right V Prav okay yeah but I know it's V Prav I know I know that much I played him I played him in uh in in the katar Masters last year but like when I played him I want to say around 2019 2020 he was a good player he was like an IM am level player maybe 24 2420 2430 I think I mean I might have the numbers wrong but not someone who's a grand master yet but when I played him over and over again it gave him immense experience like he gets to play against one of the best Poli players in the world and so it improves his level naturally and then after the pandemic of course his rating shot up immediately to close to 2600 and to me it was no surprise because i' played him so many times online I'd see the whole progression cuz I think when I first played him like 2019 I could I I don't want to like be disrespectful I felt like I could just do this this this everything and just win the game maybe one moment I have to pay attention but that's it as opposed to like nowadays when I play him even in title Tuesday I have to pay attention all the time it's not not that easy so I think that really the the world of Chess changed a lot and also the fact that the competition became so strong online between myself Magnus and others these kids are improving at a much quicker rate than they ever did before and and even quite recently um I played the German bundes Le and I was talking with shakarov who's who's actually also here as a second for abasov and he was he was basically raving about this Turkish kid uh y KH Ermas and saying how even when he plays him in Blitz like he's losing games like he's losing games to a 12-year-old kid kinded this over by the way um but they're like training and and so it's very to sort AC that you feel like you know the the world of chest can't change that much but I think it it is a very very different world than it was before the pandemic and um I think you're going to see more and more of these kids getting good it's going to be very clear that uh just the way we viewed it is is to is different than it was uh 5 years ago speaking of the Chess World changing uh you you've been a lead for a long time I think there's only been a pretty big shift of the amount of input and the amount of influence you could have on the way chess changes right so I think and you can correct me if I'm wrong uh probably before pandemic uh you know elite players were playing the tournaments that were organized for them and that was it uh if you didn't play I have no idea really what you did maybe you you were still a professional you played in Bundesliga maybe you made courses but that wasn't even that popular maybe you were a trainer uh but now do you feel you have like a greater role potentially and influence in actually changing how chess will look in the next 5 to 10 years or is that is it over exaggerated I mean I like to think I've already made the biggest contribution I can make I mean I've I've helped a lot of other content creators and I'm very proud of you of course for all the success you've had um for helping bowz as well in the early days um but from the from a Pure Chess standpoint I'm very proud of the fact that I've played so many of these kids in Blitz online that I've given them that opportunity to play against one of the best players in the world and I think it does help them with their game I I think the best example of it is actually Notre Beck I I'm pretty sure I've played him a lot more than I think I have cuz I think I played him on one of his like one of the anonymous accounts back when he was a young kid um before he was like this known known Superstar um but I I like to think that having played having played against all these kids that I've contributed and I've moved the game forward because I do think some of these kids are going to potentially be the next World Champion when you look you know look forward maybe next World Champion I don't know about that but if you look like 5 10 years down the road I'm pretty confident that at least one of the kids that I played against will be playing in a world championship match so I'm I'm very very happy with that contribution I I think it's also by being one of the best players playing as these kids their level gets better they'll be able to pass that on uh to Future generations and so I I think I mean I I actually feel like I've already made my biggest contribution in a way you know with with all the all the streaming stuff that has happened too I I think um in in the in the early days like all of us we were doing it because the the passion was was very very important I think that you know for myself I one of the great things um with having played Pro chest for so long as i' been i' been it so long I was a little bit disappointed a little bit unhappy with my results especially towards the end of 2018 and having the opportunity to find something like streaming where I could uh bring chess to a bigger audience really sort of gave me a spark and brought brought me back to life to some degree um because I I felt that I was sharing it with more than myself and I think a lot of people forget that in chess it's a very lonely world it's essentially you go to a tournament you play that's it there's no one to really support you maybe you have like a you have like one or two family members with you which definitely helps but it's not the same thing as when you feel like having like hundreds of people or thousands of people following your games and even if they're not necessarily rooting for you you feel like it's something bigger than just yourself and I feel I feel like for me from a very early age in chess I always felt like it should be bigger and uh I I always felt like you go play this great game or Magus win some amazing end game or something it's like you expect that these fans to be cheering and you think it's like wow it's the greatest thing you've ever seen But then it's just you you celebrate that's it and there's nothing more to it so uh I think it's streaming definitely helped me a lot to get to where I am today with my chess cuz without that I think there's a very good chance I wouldn't be in the Chess World today if not not for the pandemic and everything that transpired after which is wild cuz you you had a Red Bull sponsorship like how did that and I mean we know the Magnus gar photos like what was that 2016 that was a long time ago I think that started around like 2014 maybe and last till about 2019 how happened like just how did that people don't probably don't even know that like a Red Bull sponsorship is a huge deal yeah I mean the Red Bull sponsorship sort of came about cuz they were looking at various Sports they were looking actually at like social media interaction and something that just made sense and for chess the game were sport where games can go very long and you need to have energy I think they just thought it made sense as a marketing marketing thing and I I think they I actually know because they told me this but even even in like 2019 I think I had like the fourth most uh social media Impressions out of any of the athletes they sponsored so wow uh even though chess wasn't where it is today it was still I mean a lot of people were following did they ever come back with an offer now now that it's exploded no no no they never did I mean I think they they kind of moved on also a lot of people I dealt with they they sort of left the company as well but I think for me too um I remember when they they effectively dropped me around 2019 I felt very much it was because my results weren't as good I was sort of following the world rankings and I think that for myself when I when I went and won that us championship and and started at least trying to get back up there it was sort of very good motivation feel like they don't believe in me and I can I can try and go for bigger things one thing I wanted to ask not to not to Circle back to let's say a negative topic um but uh I I really was kind of taken aback by the the approach that Vladimir karnick took to talking about your statistics on ch.com while then following up that he's not accusing you of anything it's like this very fascinating uh thing and then of course he started talking about some of the uh some of the youngsters and he started talking about um just a who's who of people so what what was that like for you uh and have you been in situations in the past where people are like car's not he must be cheating like he can't be that good like is that um well I mean the the the fir first first point which I've mentioned a couple of times even if it's perhaps not public knowledge is that when I beat danil dubov in the chess Champions Tour semi-final I believe believe that was in 2020 uh he basically went and accused me of cheating privately um I I know this through people that that I've spoken to I think you've talked that at least like on stream I've spoken about on stream yes I mean I I think what I what I would say and that this is very important is can I just just what in like um you want me to get back to cic no no no no no no no I I'm I'm wondering when when you say accuse right like is it he's cheating or is it can you guys like keep a closer eye on him well he he he went to Fe and asked them to investigate the games that I play against him okay so wow wow so I guess some guys have just been more suspicious for a long time so I mean that's the that's the only clear-cut um example that I can think of prior to the whole kramnick thing um I mean again I've never heard it but of course you never really know what the situation is because you could also you could also look the other way where if we look at the case of Hans nean very specifically and uh with Hans it there were many top players talking about I mean basically everybody that I spoke to amongst the top top Grand Masters it was there it was the it was at the top of their list of things they wanted to talk about and yet Hans I mean at least he claims he he never had heard any of this so you never really know what the reality is I think there's a very good chance that Hans somehow this word never got back to Hans that all these top players were talking about him and I think you could make the same thing for me maybe like when Eric Hansen says that all these top PE all these players are uh are accusing me of cheating or their rumors about it behind the scenes there's a good chance it just never got back to me so it's very hard to know what the reality is um but I was really surprised by the kic thing for a couple of reasons first of all um kic is somebody that I played against many times I remember uh the 2009 London chess classic I think this was the I think it was 2009 it was I think the first time that I played him in classical game um we played at reg gozen and it was an exciting game ended in a draw and I really enjoyed playing against him I enjoyed the postmortem um it was just a very very pleasant experience for me to play against someone so great and have that opportunity um and even if you fast forward like I played it many many more times after that we played in many of the same events had many great games there were games that he won games that I won I remember even in Dortmund when I played him in this Kings Indian game I think it was 2014 when when he won and the last round I beat him with the black pieces and I think we analyzed for over an hour at the board like it was a very very long postmortem and so I always viewed him as as a colleagu probably one of the people that I most enjoyed playing against or even just talking to after the games just because the wealth of experience and the sort of passion he had for the game um and so from my standpoint I was just very confused by it because for example I would never go and say like okay like nepo for example or Fabiana like these are your colleagues these are people on the same level as you like again I'm not going to pretend that I haven't gotten very suspicious of people after losing a match or losing a couple of games I think every top player has done that at some point in their career but with with your colleagues directly it's just it it was very very shocking and I I would also say that um I think it's very at least in my mind it's very clear that I played much worse than the chess Champions T here in Toronto in December um than than I've played almost any other tournament in recent history because I was just so shocked by the whole thing it just made no sense whatsoever like what what exactly was going on and I mean obviously like I know I'm not cheating and I think people at home could also see because I'm playing all these games live on stream um but it was just it was just very very surprising to see and I mean whether you know whether you can say it's an accusation whether you want to say that he's just asking the games be investigated you know at the end of the day and I think this is this is a very important distinction um and I'm I'm going to refer for to Hans once again is that a lot of the times when top players were talking about Hans they would look at a game they would say there's this move or that move it was very much about the games themselves it was not a situation where it's like okay it's just a streak or you know can't have a rating this high it was based on something about the actual games themselves now of course we'll never know I mean we we'll never know whether he did or he didn't that's just the reality of the situation over the board specifically I guess but well on I mean yeah I guess the report was like it was online but theoretically it's yeah okay but but I'm saying like it was based around the games like and so like you know for example if kic like come to me and say like okay you played this move or you played that move like he gives a specific instance in the game and he were ask me to explain the move like I would actually explain the move like what was my thought process why did I play that move like and that's something that's based on actual content instead of Simply making a claim that really there there's nothing else to it other than you're saying someone can't do that and so for me it's it's very it was very very disappointing to see um at the same time I also say things like that do have to be dealt with very very quickly like as soon as I saw that tweet I think it was I don't know it was by Kik or someone else um the initial one but as soon as I saw that I felt like I have to take some action cuz when you let things like that swell to some point I think it becomes you know like a cancerous growth it's something that's just going to keep building and you really have to um you have to try and try and stop it before it gets completely out of control and of course it ended up getting out of control anyway but that's just the reality it's still out of control I mean it's still yeah I mean I I think most people are are aware of the reality at this point I mean also I find it very sad because like when I see karnick play entitled Tuesdays he does exactly as I would expect him to do there many events where he's four out of four five out of five he's in the running so he's still a very strong player I mean I know a lot of people want to say that he's a terrible player or he's washed or this or that but I mean he remains very strong he's not a weak player but he usually loses in the later rounds against the best players in the event who not only are very strong but they have very good Mouse skills their anticipation is better and um so I feel like his results are actually reflective of the fact that there there is very little cheating now I'm not going to say there's no cheating I think first of all I don't believe that I I'm sure there probably are like one or two people who might be slipping through the cracks um but at the end of the day when you go and you accuse everybody of cheating it also sort of uh muddies the waters and I don't think that it's for the better it's definitely not for the better because now I I would say like if if you make an accusation of cheating like crck Tomar he might find someone who's cheating but if he says it everyone's going to just disregard it because of course he's already shown that uh he's just going to accuse anybody of cheating I think Kik yeah there there's basically two approaches like I've talked to I've talked to all the necessary parties about this and it seems like the two approaches are karnick is accuse 10 people if one is guilty and then just somehow you know you caught them but nine are now Under Fire too whereas chess.com this was this was really interesting cuz I did kind of confront them on this and they brought up a good point like I said hey you know if in a title Tuesday a 3,000 rated Grandmaster cheats in three games once it's almost unfindable mhm and they said right but who cheats only once like which athletes cheat only once they'll cheat for a season they'll cheat and that kind of changed my perspective like of course there's no way to to to not even catch but to make a decision right ultimately like now people are saying well karnick played those games on that account and ch.com didn't flag them but that's that's ridiculous I mean like you know well it's a whole whole different issue but but actually on that issue like the only way they could probably flag it is if they were like tracking the IP but that's also a big problem because I I was thinking about that recently like probably people are probably like how how did they not see that he was playing title Tuesday from different IP and at the end of the day I don't think you can even really do that even if you try to automate it cuz I was thinking about people like Notre back or knall who are probably playing from a different country every single title Tuesday so it's not realistic I think from a technical standpoint um but yeah ultimately as far as cheating goes like what what what is the reason for it I think the notion that someone's going to cheat for one move in an individual game is just it's just absurd now I won't say that at this point someone might not try and do that against crck like I do think someone might try and do that against him just because I mean he has played some games in the last few weeks against 2700s and I'm looking at these games like yeah how did they beat karnick like that yeah no I mean I think I think there's definitely like there is possibly the motivation there but General if someone's going to cheat they're going to do it to win that's just the reality they're they're not going to do it to just because now of course like I'm talking about like prize money events not casual games of course like I can play like a random viewer Arena or some event like this and show someone shows up and they cheat against me and that's that um and they're just doing it to get a rise out of me or they're going to be able to tell their friends they won the game whatever I mean it's not not really I mean it is a big deal but it's not a big deal in the the bigger picture um so I I think that with uh with with CR it's just um the thinking that people are going to do it this way it's just silly you're you're going to cheat to win or you're not going to do it at all like if you cheat for two moves and you lose the game and then you do it in another game like the the risk reward isn't there for anybody at all um in your opinion when you play somebody cuz obviously if you play like an 1800 you you you'll know they're cheating in literally one move maybe two I mean there's like I mean I I'll know in the SE probably within the first like 10 minutes of the game no no I mean if they cheat randomly if they don't cheat but if you're just playing and then at some point they find a move and you're like what and that's like when you have that moment right but if you're playing somebody who's you know an I am 2850 on ch.com doeses it take you think a little bit longer like do you need a sample size of maybe five moves during the game right CU like you said they're not going to cheat for one move mhm to beat you they want to beat you they're going to cheat for a certain amount of moves I mean I I think ultimately yes you have to have a big sample um I think you also have to look at the end result and how how it occurred so like cuz this is the other another sort of uh issue with the whole cheating thing is that if someone cheats for five moves but let's say they're playing me or they're playing Daniel nitzki and let's just say a three game specifically we'll probably be good enough that we can keep the game going for for a while and then they'll eventually Blender at the end of the game because I mean our mouth skills are so good but definitely you need a much bigger sample size I think trying to say one move that that's not enough I think you have to look at the overall result and just the the quality of the victories against the players things of this nature um I I mean I I do think that it it does happen probably in title Tuesday but I think that ultimately like the cheating probably is much worse at lower levels where there no actual impact whatsoever yeah we see it a lot we see people make accounts and post like oh I've played 300 games I haven't been caught and I am fascinated that there's no Auto detection but I guess at the same time if millions of people are playing chess every day it's a little hard yeah yeah yeah you better have some you better be Google or somebody like really really good systems I don't really think that's uh that's possible yeah um I guess a couple couple of fun ones for you if you could be like uh top three in the world uh 2790 in the world at something else what would it be top in the world is something else uh definitely be tennis tennis tennis for sure yes yeah we talked a little bit about tennis but I didn't know if it would be a sport or I don't know it could be could be like the best commercial real estate agent or something you know those guys make money too it's uh yeah Pro probably probably tennis as far as Sports go otherwise um I would say something probably in in Tech like something in AI specifically where you know the the the future is always changing and uh to be on The Cutting Edge of things like that would be amazing you have something you read a lot or are interested in that you keep up with I know you like to talk stocks on the stream but is there something that you know we all need to invest but is there something a little bit yeah I mean I I would say that in general um I try to read like autobiographies of people uh like right now I'm reading one on Andre Agy for example um so I I try I try to read books along those lines that have like more personal stories to see people who are very successful and how they they got there or I listen to also like interviews a lot like with Bezos um people like that too uh I don't I don't read much because I don't I don't have a huge attention span at the moment I can't I gotta get back to it yeah uh it's it's really bad actually uh but my wife got me to read uh Trevor Noah's Memoir so if you want after the Agy one highly recommend it's uh it's very good it probably you probably won't read it and feel like you need to you know you didn't grow up in South Africa you it's a little bit of a different kind of memoir it's not like how he built maybe maybe but you know but I I'd make actually it's funny you should say that cuz I was thinking about streaming and and I was going to say like I think there's reason that we we were the two most successful actually um and I think it's I I can only speak for myself and not necessarily for you but I would say that like a lot depends on how you grow up and what you internalize and like for myself even though I was very successful as a chess player I always remember the early days long before that when it's like my mom was struggling as a single mother or even once ail my stepfather would spend basically most of his money to send my mom and I off to Europe to play tournaments and that sort of um Dedication that they had and sort of not taking things for granted I think played a huge role terms of my ability to consistently like uh stream every day and like work towards something more even when it wasn't a major thing just because I enjoyed it and what I was going to say about you I mean like of course I can't speak for you but I have a feeling that like you you were in a situation where like you went to school you tried you tried to play chess you tried to coach chess all these things and I think that you have these experiences so like when you're doing something like this you realize just how amazing it is and how how successful you can be I maybe I'm wrong but I feel like we're the only two who do it day after day consistently only two I don't you know it's it's I never really thought because I do get asked a lot like how do you do it four years straight I don't play obviously I don't I don't play I do the whole different thing um it's probably ingrained deep in me like I'm not very close to anyone in my family um I've talked about this quite a bit like my mom or my dad sorry guys uh but I've said it you know a lot I'm just not it's just the way I was you know brought up but I'm very close to my grandparents who came to the states at 40 and uh quit PhD level education to be a seamstress to work with you know to be a home like they had to completely rebuild their life uh with nothing I mean they came here with like a suitcase per person and that was it uh not here we're in Canada but it but the US and maybe somewhere deep down yeah it's kind of ingrained like uh not take anything for granted and I think we're we're similar in the sense that uh we've had a good amount of success but we're not these influencers in Balenciaga sweaters at influencer events like I just do my own thing you do your own thing like with playing and with with the content creation and um in that sense yeah I I almost like the American dream I guess in a way like working hard working hard not taking anything for granted yeah yeah and but there and there's there's kind of like a weird uh Arc I think in a lot of families maybe like who are experiencing this they come here they get themselves up and now the kid is Born Into privilege in the sense of like how does the kid then do even better and I I I it was a complete Miracle like it I went to college to be a full-time professional and you know go to I once was going to corporate events you tried college first semester you decided to go back to uh to chess but I was fully set on College and then in college I I just thought let me try to teach some chess and um it's for yeah it's a little bit of Fortune a little bit of good luck but you obviously also have to uh work super hard at it so yeah everybody's doing their own thing um there's a lot of Chess channels now that that do a whole bunch of stuff uh and uh some play in person some make like instructional content it's it's it's kind of interesting to see uh and it is a little bit weird though because we went from riding the wave up to like at least I feel this way we now have to keep it going if we stop Yes like the ecosystem is kind of dead I mean I'm not taking anything away from anybody else I would say like every I mean of course over the last like year I've heard many ways of trying to you know keep a chess boom Going or trying to improve things and I I feel like the the biggest thing that and maybe this is the the most important thing in some terms if I can try and give back more is that like the players who are up and coming they understand how important social media is and they try to build some profiles because it is very true that I I feel like at the moment if tomorrow like you and me we go to Niagara Falls and God forbid God forbid we fall we just die or like magots is there too um it feels like the world is over so um not oh my God I I thought maybe like the internet goes out for a few weeks but all right yeah we fall into Niagara Falls all right I got to I got to finish my will I got to oh my God all right but I I just feel like ultimately yeah I mean it's so so much of it is held up really by the three of us youi and and Magnus of course hey it's me again just wanted to quickly jump in here and add a little bit of context because I was watching the interview back we were editing it and I felt like right around here we pivoted quickly we sort of topic changed quickly and watching it back I want to clarify something very important the point that I was not that really neither of us was trying to make is the fact that Magnus hikaro and myself are somehow the entire chess ecosystem the point that I think hikaro was trying to make there was the fact that if he and Magnus just vanished or let's just say retired that's a scary proposition and so we need the next generation of players the next the the the next generation of these young talents to connect to the audience to build fan bases to generate a level of interest and there can't just be this fascination with Magnus and Hikaru which we do see in YouTube thumbnails in my own YouTube thumbnails right we see this a lot the Magnus the hikaro the Hans neimans like these are the guys that get a lot of views um we briefly mentioned uh hikaro mentioned an cremling but there's a lot of excellent content creators over here there's obviously cramling there's the botes sisters Eric Rosen Daniel nitki just to name a few in India I mean SE is doing a great job but chess base India I mean my God Sagar sha is like changing the chess journalism game completely so I think the point that we were trying to make there it it goes beyond Us big three like we're definitely a big three but there's a lot of Chess content creators out there and we are now responsible for pushing this game to new heights but the Next Generation has to be ready to take over and just like in sports right like in tennis you got the guys like alcaras you got sinner right you got meddev you got all these great young players you need that next gen of chess players to generate the same level of excitement and interest so we will see if guys like gesh Prague from India kimer no your backck if these guys can do this type of stuff because we're not you know I'm not going to do YouTube Forever and Magnus and hiar who might be retiring soon right so I think that was the the point that was trying to be made there um just to clarify a lot of great people in Chaz doing a lot of really great things but what is next for the future I don't know good thing I don't have to answer that question right now let's get back to the interview yeah I mean I that's I think one of the biggest drive driving motivations for me right now is to to try and keep it going as much as I can um for as long as I can certainly and hopefully there will be people who who who rise I mean I think there are so many people who are successful like Anna cramling for example um amongst amongst others and um yeah I I I just hope that as far as the professional end goes like you know Fe whether it's feed whether it's chess.com they try to they try to understand how important this is if they want the game to keep growing um and not just be centered around a handful of people yeah at the end of the day also uh I there there's two sides of the whole thing for me uh chess is a very specific activity where four generations of a family can enjoy it together so it's kind of a no-brainer that it does get really big and then on the other side of things why does any sport or any media grow it's like money like if there's money to be made at the highest level more money to be made with sponsors with gambling that's a huge one in every Sports League now which is kind of you know it's a little maybe fortunate unfortun whatever you know I mean I think that's the another point that I would say also though is that a lot of people have this perspective of CH like there's the right way and the wrong way and like so like you know growing up I played a lot of Blitz there are many people who said like playing Blitz online or playing Blitz in person it's very very bad it's not going to help your game whatsoever there's a very like straightforward methodical approach that you're supposed to do things one way and I feel that a lot of the top players now they're they're so focused on chess alone and they worry that if they spend time on these other things it's going to detract or take away from their chess but I I actually think um for the most part as long as everything is balanced it's very very beneficial but most people I think view it as something that if they do it they're probably not getting a short there's going to be no return um right away and then also maybe it maybe it'll hurt their chest so I think there's a very fine line and balance that you have to to walk um but I I do hope top players especially the junior Juniors start to like realize it's people like Vincent for example I think um you know coming from a Western Country like Germany um trying to build that profile because ultimately the personalities are what will bring people and just a Funny Story I played the Bundesliga in Germany about a month ago and I think I said this on my stream too but I was there and I played a n in one of the critical rounds and um the audience was massive there were many people who were there just because there was an article about me competing and after the game vishy was telling me like I've had to sign more autographs and take more pictures here than I've ever had to take in like the 20 years of playing the Bundesliga combined W um and I think that sort of speaks volumes to how if people come out to watch chess that will make a difference and that that will potentially lead to more sponsors wow that is uh that is very special uh you've definitely increase the amount of people you have had to sign things for take photos I saw in the in the lobby like there was a there was there was just people happens it happens to you too I'm sure I that's that's maybe the only downside actually is I I said this too is one of the greatest things I felt about playing chess professionally pre pandemic is that I would get recognize a lot in Germany for whatever reason um but like in the US or elsewhere I could just literally go to any any any store go uh go get food do whatever and just just be nobody um and ever since then it's quite the opposite I mean when I go through airports anywhere almost always someone recognized me um and so there's you know that is a little bit of a down like sometimes you you don't want to be recognized everywhere but that is the price of Fame sometimes you're you're it's been worth it I yeah like one of my funniest uh I have I have a pretty funny story um and I'm sure it's the say like you're not always in the mood to talk to people you know like eight nine times out of 10 on the street you're like happy to talk to people like One time my Lucy and I were having just it wasn't even like an argument we were just like bickering about something and some dude running by on the street were carrying bags of groceries D's like what's up Levi and I'm like that's not my name and he just like ran away you know like and and and and and then she was like you would have never said that you know you would have been so like mean to him if uh we hadn't been bickering and I was like well you know what like get my name right all right like you get called like Hikaru or you get I'm just like it's like it's not my name dude like it's uh but it didn't know it's uh it's definitely funny and yeah there's the whole down there's downside to being you know known you got to be a little bit more secretive and protective and and things like that and you kind of have to like behave in public if I ever a burger while waiting for a plane like if I get it on my face I look stupid someone's going to like come up to me and I've done some dumb things in public like spilled stuff on myself and someone wants a picture or whatever it's it's kind of funny um you ever play anybody that smells bad I have yes okay don't we don't have to give names but like it was a Russian Grand Master he about like he was over 2700 at one point I think usually around like 2680 too many details we're going to find someone's going to figure out strong Grand Master it's well known though it's it's well known oh I see was it a distraction it wasn't that big of a I think it's more he just he didn't wear deodorant that's all so I have a I played a tournament once and I was playing and uh I was playing I was playing an older guy and there was a really gross smell coming you know from around and I was like man this old guy you know he's like can't believe he's not wearing deod it's summer and everything and then like a round later I played next to a a guy who I played next to when I was playing the old guy and I realized it was the young guy like the the teenager wasn't showering and the old guy was great he I felt so bad I I didn't say anything but I was sitting like oh my God this is terrible yeah they got to wear deodorant that's like a big thing yeah uh and um handshakes are kind of fun yeah there's like who's who's got the best handshake at the elite level um I think Magnus probably is the best handshake objectively um I mean there there others too but I his is the one that stands out the most and of course there's a meme about the best handshake ever between him and me so there's some video on YouTube yeah uh well there's some guys that like stand the shake hands which is a big big thing yeah actually Magnus does that most time usually I would say like 90% of the time he arrives late to the game so whoever he's playing is sitting down and then he arrives and he's standing up when he when he offers him the handshake um but there are other people who are very polite like David nvar from the Czech Republic who like if his opponent comes he STS up and he bows a little bit and then he then he shakes the hand so it just depends I guess it depends on the person um I'll let you get back to uh to the to the Grind but uh I never had a chance to ask you if not if what would be your price to chess box to chess box um it has to be High um because there's a chance that I get knocked out I don't have my capacities so I mean it's probably something like 10 million around there something around what Magnus said so yeah that's that's about what it is so oh you're you're saying that's no I'm not saying I'm saying I'm not saying now I'm saying we can't organize that because it's too much money you know we got to we got to scale it down a bit yeah that's I would say somewhere around there I mean I I I don't really know how dangerous boxing truly is um it's bad it's hard to judge but I feel like if it's two complete beginners then maybe it's maybe the the chance of damage is fairly low but no one's ever at the same level and I think we've seen that even in some of the chess boxing events like even when they start training and they're supposed to be beginners some people are just more much more naturally gifted um so it's different it's different because uh you compete and you you're still doing very well a lot and I think if if you go to competition you get like knocked out that's what I'm really concerned about uh it's it's not a good look right like if any sports like it's a it's always a bad look it's always a bad look in any sport when somebody has this like you know steep drop off like that so anyway I I there's a lot of hype around it but I don't think anybody any of the people's favorite you know personalities are going to ever do it uh except we'll just send Andrea bz out constantly she will be the chess boxer and well but like that's a good example I mean she she boxed she's probably she spent much more time I think than Michelle Michelle car and um and basically but the thing is the background because Michelle car had had box a lot she's not but she's AAL athlete like she was still even even though I think she probably trained less objectively think Andrea did she was just she was just much better um yeah so I think I think it's hard to ever find a chess boxing match that's really going to be be balanced um but I mean we'll see maybe maybe one day maybe one day he Caro pleasure as always no problem let you get back to the grind and um thanks for joining me yeah welcome
