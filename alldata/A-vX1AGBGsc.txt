- Today me and the crew are
going back to 1st grade. At the end of the class, we'll
receive a 10 question test. And if you miss more than
two questions on the test you fail and get pelted by water balloons, and you don't proceed to the next grade. Last person to fail school gets $10,000, or if everyone makes it to
12th grade, we all get it. All right, Jake Pollers, me and the crew are going back to first grade today. We're waiting on our first teacher. - Hello teacher.
- Shh. - Good morning class, I'm Miss Woodford, and I want you guys to go
around and say your name, and say one interesting
fact about yourself, okay? - I'll start.
- Okay. - My name's Chris and nobody likes me. - My name's Mr. Beast,
and I don't like school. - My name's Chandler and I like Gushers. - My name's Garrett
and my dad has a yacht. - I'm Ethan, I like Fortnite. - I'm Bailey, I had oatmeal for breakfast. Okay. So first we're gonna do some reading. So I'm gonna read a story
now, I want your guys to pay really close attention okay. So Chandler, what happened
in the beginning of that? - I didn't get to write down anything. - So now we're gonna do some math. - So we're about to take
our first grade test. - I told you to put that camera away.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - Clear our desk. Put all calculators away. Okay you have 10 questions and 10 minutes. - Stop looking. - When you get done you can
put your head down silently, just like Chris is. All right, everyone can sit back up and give your paper to your partner. Number one is A, number five is A. And 10 is C. Did anyone miss more than two questions? - No.
- No. - Congratulations, you're
going to 2nd grade. - Hi class.
- Hey! - I'm Miss Bruinton, welcome to 2nd grade. All right, Math. - Yeah, so who's gonna
volunteer for the first one? - Me.

- That he didn't have to show his work. - Ethan got 80, I got 80, Chris got 100, Garrett got an 80, Bailey got
100 and Chandler missed three. Which means he failed
and needs to be punished. - You failed 2nd grade, bro. - Honestly, people are
gonna think it's staged. - You need to leave that part in there. People are gonna think it's stage. Chandler's just dumb. - Chandler dude, you
