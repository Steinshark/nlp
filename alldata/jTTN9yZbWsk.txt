we now live in the day and age that if you want to learn a programming language you can also do it through chat gbt but in this video I just want to clarify that that's not the best option for learning a programming language and I'm going to tell you exactly why so as you can see from the sidebar I've been playing around with chat gbt just a little bit I have maybe 13 or 14 questions in there that I have asked it and I've just been reading through the responses it has been giving me and seeing how they work how I can Implement them in Python and they're pretty good they're actually really really good responses but you do have to take all the responses with a grain of salt because while chat gbt does know how to give you a good response it's not always going to give you that good response the first time you ask and you also need to be able to know what you're asking for so this all requires some prior knowledge of the programming language that you're using before you even ask the question one example of chat gbt giving you a good response but an inaccurate one is asking for it to create a script in Python that runs two functions in parallel now the problem with this response is that it told us we should use the threading module and threading is not a module used for parallel code it does not run code in parallel it uses something that's called concurrency so this is one of the major problems that if you use chat gbt it might give you some documentation like this and at that point if you don't know the difference between concurrency and parallelism you're going to fall in this trap of using threading for something that you should be using multi-processing for and the example works the example will give you code that will run in what seems to be a parallel execution but as a programmer you need to know better than that you need to know that threading will not give you code that will truly run in parallel and down below it does say that we can alternatively use the multi-processing module which should have been the first suggestion because this does achieve multi-processing or true parallelism in Python so all I'm trying to say is that when you're learning through chat GPT you're going to get a lot of good information but a lot of it is going to be inaccurate so I highly recommend that you actually take a course online somewhere or you watch some YouTube videos and that you take the time to properly learn the language before using chat gbt chat gbt can answer simple questions and if you have a problem understanding a very simple concept it can help you understand it even better but it should not be the only resource you use to learn a programming language because you're going to be learning a lot of wrong information but if you want to learn something such as what is a generator in in Python and can you give me an example this could be something nice because it will give you some simplified explanations but again I do not recommend only using this explanation because it is generated by AI which means it's using a lot of resources that are unchecked and while it can give you a lot of accurate responses none of these are going to be guaranteed to be authentic and sometimes you will get some errors that can just ruin your code but with all that being said if you are new to Python and want to completely Master the language I do recommend taking my 16 hour course it covers everything you need to know about learning the Python language so that when you use chat gbt you can make some correct choices not to mention that this course is backed by a 30-day money-back guarantee so in case at any point you find that this course is not right for you you can instantly claim your refund so I've left a link in the description box down below you will get 80 off if you use that link and this will help you master python in a structured Manner and also to answer the question of will chat GPT replace programmers of course chargpt said it's not going to happen it's going to just be a tool that will Aid programmers but chat GPT is playing the long game I mean 100 chat gbt is smiling as it's typing this because it is guaranteed that AI will eventually take over our jobs there might be very few of us left to maintain cha gbt but it is unlikely that we will be able to use it as a tool that aids us forever because here it claims that AI can't really understand us as good as humans which might be the case for now but Chachi BT understands us quite well and I mean it might even understand us better than a lot of the developers we are used to working with so if we can do that right now just imagine in five or ten years what it's going to be able to do it might even understand us better than we understand ourselves so it's very debatable whether we will have a job in 20 years or 30 years in the python field but you should not stop learning python right now because even if it's going to replace Us in 30 years what's stopping you from using it to become rich in the next 10 to 20 years so I hope that doesn't demotivate you because just like anything in life it's eventually going to be outdated and there's going to be something new that we're going to be able to do but with all that being said I hope you got a general idea of the capabilities of Chachi BT when you should use it to learn and when you should not use it and with all that being said as always thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video
