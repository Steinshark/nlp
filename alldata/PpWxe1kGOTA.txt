so hello everybody i am sitting here with christian hua for those who follow the channel you have probably seen my past interviews with him on jacqueline and some mcluhan as well and the question of technicity the the problem of technology and so he has recently written an article on marshall mcluhan and his relationship differences to orthodoxy because marshall mcluhan was a catholic looking at the places of contact with orthodoxy but also the differences and also the possibility within mcluhan of understanding how his ideas connect to symbolic world and to symbolic vision and so i really thought it would be a great opportunity to explore a little more marshall mcluhan's work see how it connects to symbolism and also see how he was able to perceive some of the things that we are seeing happen around us in terms of technology in terms of social transformation and so i'm really looking forward to this conversation [Music] this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world [Music] so kristal maybe you can tell us a little bit about your experience with mcluhan i know the text that you wrote for us was already presented at a conference before beforehand yeah the it was at the the faith and works uh mcluhan faith and works conference in winnipeg saint paul university in 2015 uh centered on the religious dimension of mclean's thought and activity uh which has often been overlooked but uh which has surfaced more in the to the discussion since the publication of this book by his son eric who uh the medium and the live reflections on religion uh which is a collection of of some of the mcluhan's uh uh articles and and letters uh pertaining to religion uh that it but it appeared in 1999 i believe and actually uh and i won't uh dwell on it because james cortines already has in his uh in his introduction to his own reading of of my recent article uh on mcl on mcluhan for the blog so uh so um [Music] well my it was i guess among my first uh direct engagements with mcluhan which has informed my thought for uh uh maybe decades probably since the 1980s my thought on on technique but is right uh so i i i i i'm a bit of a dabbler in his thought but it's so it's so nourishing that even is concentrating on a couple of articles like we're going to do it you know it it could you could have a whole seminar on that but certain issues that stand out yeah in ways that will uh bring something to everyone's thinking on symbol symbolism and so one of the things that i find fascinating with mcluhan and i think that is really illuminating is the manner in which he talks about technique as an extension of the human person as you know this is something that i'm very fascinated with in terms of the symbolism of the garments of skin uh but mcluhan really emphasizes on the techn the techniques of information like media writing but then today with television and all the different media as extensions of the psyche and so he really he really tries to show how this extension of the psyche is different than just let's say physical technologies like cars and all that so maybe you can tell tell us a little bit about his his understanding of this extension of the psyche well it's more it it it's more down to worse than that it's it's extension of the nervous system see because uh technologies are extensions of specific uh organs uh as they appear in human history you know the wheel is an extension of of the foot uh uh well the house also is an extension of the skin this could go on for every medium you can identify what does this what does this extend in man's uh basic physical equipment and on the physical basis that well well what what okay so so the the basic the basic uh historical anthropological distinction is between for him is between um oral audio tactile cultures which is sort of the baseline of mankind for most of its of its history uh and and and visual dominated uh uh uh cultures that's structured by the phonetic alphabet that first appear uh when greeks adapt the definition uh uh uh uh alphabet that is where where the the the the the letters the the characters correspond to sound completely independent of of any association with their shape etc it's completely arbitrary but that gives a amazing flexibility in in applications to to classify things and order them categorize them and that extends the the reach of man but it also extends a specific sense which is uh the eyes uh uh because uh in in normally at the at the at the kind of uh baseline of of of oral or uh most traditional cultures common sense is uh again i guess well there's a certain balance in the sensorium in the uh in the general uh distribution of emphasis between the different uh sensory inputs uh but the the ones that that that's that are uh are are can can be said to be to give the tone for the whole thing is more the hearing and and touch which are related because uh uh touch involves it's is also about gaps you know you you when you touch something and you don't merge with it there's there's there's a sensitive gap uh a resident gap you would say and so it's there's a continuity between that and and sound now these sensations are are are kind of they tend to be um non-specific they're they're low death and and low definition and and they they surround you and you can't you can't focus you can't close your ears you know you you hear things in a kind of environmental way so you you receive all of experience kind of simultaneously uh but in a sense that in a kind of heterogeneous way uh discontinuous way because you know things will will uh stand out in in very local ways that that that uh that that you can't you can't really standardize it it's it's just all jumbled together and and if there is an order to to emerge from that is to a kind of a a full-body attunement when you're when you listen to something and you attune yourself to to the whole environment which will in this context you know the world culture will be the whole tribal of communion a communal environment where there's not much of a distinction between the individual and the group i mean this distinction really arises once you have uh uh with with the phonetic alphabet you have to um you have to you have to uh to focus while abstracting from from context you have to to to kind of like kind of um you have to focus on the characters and and and and and you you have a kind of meant let's say a mental image a very uh schematic mental image a concept uh so you you you have a kind of pinpoint ability which you can also which you can use to sort things in the very sectoral sectoral ways and and and uh you so you can make the space more continuous therefore you can have citizens with equal rights in the community called the police the city uh uh which uh and and have you know statues that are very clear and realistic et cetera it's very detailed because you can sort of surround visually uh what is given to you in experience surveys make it into a the sum of individual parts you know rather than a kind of whole body uh um uh experience uh that that you you just receive everything like a vision you know a division is uh it's kind of an acoustic thing you know there's many many apparent paradoxes like that but you you receive things sort of uh frontally wherever you you wherever you you look in an acoustic state because it's it's all kind of an apparition out of out of nowhere like out of a fog or in in the dark whereas uh uh with with the visual emphasis like the light light is turned on and everything is very very clear very clear uh outline uh no uh there's little few surprises there was everything is more or less a surprise in an acoustic space it's like being being in the fog you're sort of in in wonder or at whatever whatever happens you have a more a kind of magical or sacred relationship if if the lights are turned on and everything is sort of uh in its single place and not every uh not in ambivalent positions that could move without uh without warning uh it's more much more predictable so you can uh there's a control of the environment is more possible there so now now that is the the the the classical greeks were the first to pioneer that and to give out some of the key uh uh uh uh the the the the basic elements of western civilization but uh things reverted to a more as more scribal and acoustic conditions in the late roman empire and born in in the near east etc uh and in the middle ages these were still large largely still acoustic culture even though they did they wrote manuscripts now what changes everything is the advent of print uh well i've argued in my in my in my article that actually the shift to visual dominance and mcluhan recognizes that this at started the at the very around the time of the of the great schisms there was already a kind of visual bias but it came to a head with with interchangeable uh print where you could sort of uh [Music] uh uh this this i this uh segmentation categorization standardization could have a kind of mass uh the dimension that could you know others it it heightened uh individual uh identity and also non-local collective identity like nations and churches and sects had to be defined in yes or no uh in or out terms that were very sharp you know so there had been multiplication of set of sects and of nation states uh rather than broad universal jurisdiction where you had a kind of i guess a fractal relation between the the local unit and the universal one now you had to have the the standardized holes on the national or ideological scale now this started to change that was the gutenberg that's the gutenberg galaxy but that begins to be to to shift to the but uh that's uh the the title of uh mcluhan's famous 1962 book book that one of the first that made him famous on on this revolution caused by print now uh that's that's followed that something changes all together uh with the with the new electric media that begin with a telegraph in the 1840s followed by radio telephone uh [Music] major little television computers these are electric media they're they're a new environment and what they emphasize is what the organ they emphasize uh in different ways is that is uh is the central nervous system itself so it's your it's it's your your neural wiring uh both physical and cerebral that that is outered it it's it it's now centered on on on this external wiring of of well physical wires and now in a wireless way a kind of diffuse a global environment which is what he meant by the global village which has like the original oral village acoustic properties where again things like symbolism can find new currency in the way that they could not in the highly uh uh visual dominated rationalistic methodical uh and and quantitative oriented world of the gutenberg galaxy so there are new opportunities i guess for interesting symbolism and in it for him it shows in the the new receptivity of uh contemporary man for uh for uh tribal peoples oriental religions and even the oriental forms of christianity you know that's what uh my my article dealt with um so these are the neo-acoustic traditions the new tribal environment that is created by the extensions of the the the nervous system outside our body so that we have now actually ourself and our consciousness is mostly outside of us so i think to me one of the things that makes it difficult for me to kind of get into mcluhan is at first is terminology for example this oral versus visual terms at first you wonder why like you kind of wonder what he's saying because like you said that there are certain aspects which which you could say is visual but he considers more oral tactile depending on on its kind of integrative yeah uh exactly so he ends up it ends up being more about something which is more kind of holistic this kind of holistic experience versus something which is focused yes and and segmented and so if you understand it that way then his terms start to make more sense and you can see how the progression that he that he talks about in terms of the gutenberg galaxy or the gutenberg explosion in terms of this uh you know this this hyper focus this technical possibility of putting knowledge in books in a way that was not possible before because in the world of the manuscript even let's say in the world of the ancient uh text you would have a line of text so people don't realize that in ancient manuscripts there was no separation between words you would just have a line of text which would cross the entire page and the person reading because it was low definition as you as you mentioned the person reading would have to buy his inner knowledge separate the words separate the paragraph separate the sentences and so with the gutenberg explosion there is a need to create these clear sentences paragraph punctuation all of this becomes hyper focused all of this is happening at the same time there's a shift in thinking it seems yeah and individual access to standard text it starts with the bible you know therefore even the standardization the absolute standardization of all text becomes necessary because we're printing them so we need to un until now there's some variability which exists in the manuscripts because of transcription errors because of you know different traditions of manuscripts uh that are somewhat standardized but then when then we get to the printed text it has to be standardized and dialed in now you have to standardize national languages that are uh that are uh uh uniform within certain certain boundaries and that that that applies to all of society it has to be uh uh uniform so that that there's interoperability between the the the the all the all the agencies the manifestation of these new extensions of man they don't function if they don't have standardization on a certain territory and now all that is is is offended when it becomes electorate because there's the the the the boundaries are are fuzzy things that happen you know and on on on on more and more of a global well of course the world had been globalized by capitalism explorations were like already under gutenberg but it it happens at uh at the less territorial and more directly experiential level through the media themselves uh starting with the telegraph radio etc television and our computers so that that becomes the primary reality actually uh uh of how we experience even ourselves you know to to these reflections of these extensions uh well you know just look at smartphones it's they've become a new organ that i've had for a dozen years and our self our very identity is complete is centered in it now if someone loses their phone they lose their face the public face and we come back that's why we come back to uh and an and and shame culture as opposed to a a guild culture which was a hallmark of uh more of uh uh of the gutenberg galaxy and alphabetics we come back to oral conditions what the worst thing that can happen to you is uh is to lose faith to be canceled to not not have a good reputation in your in your immediate community to be shunned by your village which is now the global village cancel culture yeah cancer culture is definitely part of it we also notice in the in the age of the cell phone in the age of uh of the internet especially we can see the breakdown of grammar there's a deliberate breakdown of grammar in order to manifest tribal affiliation you can see that in meme culture where they will on purpose if someone who can spell the world word will on purpose misspell words in order to to create a sense of tribal uh tribal group uh and so mcluhan even already in the 1960s was seeing this re-tribalization which he talks about through electric media of course he didn't have the internet at the time but he was definitely foreseeing something like the internet um in the uh in the in the playboy article which he gave he really does talk about you know this this inter connectivity and this this exteriorization and and how it's going to lead to re-tribalization what's fascinating about his interpretation is that he he was predicting you know he was predicting a a return to ethnic uh conflict a return to uh tribal conflict in terms of nations and everything one of the things i don't know if he first saw was rather what uh you know what people are talking about right now in terms of mimetic tribes which is that we we have broken down into tribes but these tribes are these strange ideological tribes which are not centered in space and so you have online tribes which which connect to each other and these online and they're not related to your local they're not spatial they're not special they're they're entirely in this this new the the subtle dimension uh uh of an outward uh psyche of an outer wiring a an outer brain with an outer collective planetary brain yeah that's what they are uh and uh you just mentioned the the the the you know mccoon article in people we should we should i guess specify what we're talking about this this interview is based aside from our own article on two uh mcluhan's two contributions to to playboy magazine which are actually probably the best introduction to his to start this is famous a very long interview in the the the april 16 1969 issue uh which is very well known included in anthologies like this one the essential mcluhan there's also a less known uh uh article by him uh april uh 19 uh no december 1968 which we also read the uh in preparation of this interview so uh but the the the uh so the mcluhan interview in playboy and is one of the he didn't like interview he would he would just sort of uh ramble out uh you know spin out his ideas but he didn't like the interview format because it would pin him down you know uh yeah you can turn it off and then yeah i'll cut that out don't worry well i think it's it's pretty good my point yeah exactly i feel like like i've cut a limb yeah you cut it off and thrown his phone away um but well throw out your eye if it offends you and you know uh if it if if it causes you to sin yeah and and probably it's something that that that i think in his more sober super new sober moods he might countenance you know and uh i like to cut that off yeah and of course to him with electric conditions the deal is uh uh an ear for an eye you know i'm here for now yeah he mentioned that in his article so so mclean saw the this re-tribalization one of the things that i i struggle with or one of the things that i'm i see that he talks about but i'm not sure i don't know how clearly he saw it or if he was just kind of he seemed to have some weird kind of prophetic capacity is he talks about re-tribalization he talks about the breakdown this return to these tribal identities you could say this is something that i noticed as well the return of identity in different manners is it seems to be coming back uh you know in some scary and some more interesting ways but then he also talks about how that will lead or that is also part of this global village and so on the one hand you have a re-tribalization but on the other hand you have what he talks about in terms of moving towards a kind of unifying world or a unified world under this new global consciousness or this this conscience that will rise above the the yeah well it's not it's less uh it's less under or over but that's as you know it's it's well uh yes it's it's it's hard to follow him there because i mean because there's these two aspects tribalization and and global consciousness so the tribal aspect that what he describes in 1969 is that there too is this amazing resonance he talks about the the the the the the the impending civil war of the united states that will not will not survive long as a unified country will will break up into many states along racial and regional lines the problem is that if i don't know if he would have seen that what he's suggesting has become even more complicated through this mimetic tribe and so it's it's almost now impossible to think of the united states breaking down in regional that's it yeah because because now it's it's all through the system you have these these these different groups that are set up and these tribes are entirely online really yeah they don't have much of a geographic space unless unless people come out and start burning buildings as we've seen as we saw this year it's like the conflict is all is emerging is popping out into the into the real world right now but it starts online exactly it all starts basically yes it is yeah you're totally right it's and canceled culture is is based online um and so this is really i mean this is the place where i struggle although it's like i struggle to understand him because he talks about a return to memetic or he doesn't use dominic but a return to tribalism a a less individualized society a society which is more based on group affiliation uh but then he also talks about this kind of desire for global consciousness and i see it to me it doesn't make sense but i see it around me everywhere that is the narrative that is being proposed to us in terms of global culture is exactly that right yeah it is a kind of it's a kind of idea of of of like a diversity but at the same time everybody is in the same global culture there's an element of that that is not being ideological here no from it far from it you know his own stance really basically he'd like to be a hobbit you know that that's he'd like to be in a constant small scale uh craft based semi-scribal culture that didn't really change but he has to deal with the the culture in which he's born and he tries not to have value judgments about it so he's just describing it and yet so it sort of plays with what it could become it could be something not that bad something actually like a village except on a different scale but which could also be a nightmare you know so well one of the most astounding two images that he proposes in the same interview in this paper interviews that on the one hand he moves at first he's talking about media but then he moves in a weird mystical space where he talks about what's coming as replacing or being analogous to the to the the body of christ in the church but at a global scale and so there's a there's a strange move towards this image but then he also says maybe it could also be the antichrist yeah and so and so i'm wondering if he and other places if you've seen him talk about this or what he'd what would differentiate that and if not what you think would differentiate the two so i've been thinking about about that because it's rarely clear i mean for every instance where he seems to to to lean in one direction you can find another another where where he leans the other and that happens in this very within a couple of pages in this playboy interview that's what happens uh you know it could it it it could fulfill the diet on not on a galactic scale you know it's kind of uh i mean it's it's well it's transhumanist territory really you know it's uh uh a kind of uh uh a global consciousness that would have shifted uh with that with no no distinction between the individual and the collective and would expand throughout the the universe and reshape it in a kind of uh artistic way it would sort of refashion itself in an artistic way uh well that is that's his uh optimistic um hypothesis um uh well i i want to come back first to the to the the the tension with the how can that happen at the same time as the as the re-tribalization uh uh well what's in common is that in both the tribal and the global level the individual sort of merges back into into the or more oral uh collective uh i i i i guess he he he suggested he suggested since it's the same electronic elements even these tribal conflicts are well they could settle well he's talking in 1969 it could settle into some uh some some kind of uh accepted diversity where where every tribe would appreciate the other one as a tribe within this common element well he doesn't uh i mean other places he says well the global village is not about you know peace and harmony it means that that that you're you're always too close for comfort and looking over your shoulder and thinking that that someone might have cursed you and said you have the evil lie you know and and you're almost on the edge of being at each other's throat and and so it's not a it's not a cozy place so you know so he always but his way of thinking is by sending out probes you know by in a sense uh troy literally literally try it throwing out ideas into this new environment and see what sticks you know playing playing with them and see what how what echo will come back see what uh uh saw some different probes different instances of his of his speculations give different results at different times so they're all possibilities to to entertain but but i guess at that that at that particular fireside chat he was was in a relatively good mood so he tried to entertain the more positive uh the positive side of things where he thought that maybe the creativity that he drew personally from it from his is his literate culture and then the avant-garde figures in in in in in in in western literature that that sort of uh foresaw uh the the changes ahead maybe if if that the creativity of a choice or a pound or an elliot it may be it could be shifted to the to the to the global uh uh uh electric uh neo uh acoustic uh uh environment which the the the the uh uh they foreshadowed in in in their work so that's an optimistic hypothesis but but what my my perception of that is you you can't have creativity uh on a kind of uh for for a collective brain on the on on on the planet on the scale of a planet you have to have uh uh embodiment in a finite self that has to to find its ways around the the the the the different dimensions of it of its finitude in in space and time and and the uh a kind of uh uh [Music] aesthetic and spiritual wonder at its own contingency trying to renegotiate uh the the the different parameters of its of its embodied of of embodied existence every moment it's something that artists do by feeling out the environments is seeing how things could be experiencing and enacting how things could be reconfigured how the connections could be made with these different directions of the self i don't see this being so up uploaded to a collective artificial intelligence uh it would just go on you know like like a borg or whatever you know you know that that's that i mean how else do you do yeah imagine something spreading like that to the to the earth and beyond you know yeah reminds me it reminds me you know of uh the projected ending of june you know where where there's there's a kind of uh uh a a a collective awakening well uh the the messiah paul muad dibs skill but everyone says i am paul i'm paul and paul and the whole planet so start to move to the universe to bring in a collective enlightenment to the whole universe of this collective consciousness it's a kind of 60s yeah it's like an electric these things you know it doesn't age well but i think that there's something about his apocalypticism which is interesting in the sense that there you know you see in the christian tradition you'll see this notion of the two versions of the last judgment christ talks about how the wheats and the tares are growing together and that it's only at the end that we'll be able to separate the wheat from the tears and so i think that maybe his intuition was something like that where he was he was seeing that in this increase in technicity that it that there's extreme danger and extreme extreme uh danger of falsification of uh of chaos of pride but at the same time he can't completely discount it he sees there's also positive in it and is different he was struggling to separate the two but it's it's a it's a it's a strange thing because even in terms of the difference between christ and antichrist everybody thinks that they'll be the one who who can tell the difference uh but it's it's very different it's very difficult to know you know that the difference between let's say uh an example in scripture the difference between judas telling christ that they should use the money to help the poor and christ telling us to help the poor yeah and so what is the difference there is a difference between the two but i think that it's easy to be seduced by by you know by one or the other that's it's easy to be seduced by the falsification and in terms of i think that in i wonder in terms of where we're seeing it go now in terms of the little versions of what he's talking about like something like facebook or or twitter or even google itself we can really perceive the dark aspects of this kind of global consciousness or this this this like global brain we can see it taking form in front of us and it doesn't it doesn't necessarily look pretty because it is too it too easily becomes a frame that can be manipulated and once we're connected to it then that manipulation becomes 1984 style the inevitability of of of reality like that first page of google the first page of google search has become the new frame of many people's perception except there's no big brother in this constellation no no one no one's in particular is is is is ordering all of this you know and anyone who does is itself a a a a a dispensable organ of that configuration which has a mind of its own you know our most our mind is mostly already offloaded up there and to come back to the contrast of tribalization and globalization well what we're experiencing now is both at once tribalization heightens our fascination our our absorption and migration into the global medium that's where our being is and the more we're excited about tribal conflict the more we we are the the the the global uh consciousness so uh uh and so sorry for those who think that that that you know uh uh vaccines or viruses or or or whatever are going to invade your body from outside you're already inside the beast i like to say we're already uh intestinal flora in the belly of the beast yeah that you have to deal with that it's not coming from outside you're already being digested you're part of its metabolism so what do we do with that yeah but would you like one of the ways to understand it this is a way that it's going to scare people when i say it but to me a way of understanding it has to do with talking about the traditions in enoch right this this notion of the fallen angel or this notion of the principality which falls into the world and brings about the mechanical world or the metallurgic world that is there before the flood you know and so when we say that there's nothing let's say controlling it uh to me all bodies need principalities okay and so i can't i to let's say nobody in particular right but there are to me there has to be some principalities that are that are using this as a as a body and so i don't i don't necessarily and i don't want to free i don't want people to be freaked out like i'm thinking but i think that there's an inevitability and because the system like because the systems are geared towards our passions let's say it's clear that facebook and twitter use our irascible passions to stay alive that's how they they they feed on our our our our conflict uh it matters uh not one with which which side you're on in the culture wars the the deeper you're in well on whatever side the deeper you you you you're within the one subject that that is uh of this this this whole thing that you think you're fighting you know yeah yeah well there has been there has been a let's say i think there has been some efforts on part of some of the media texts to take sides but every time they really do take a side they they in the end end up weakening their own beast because like you said it feeds off conflict if you say we're going to remove extremes from this side then they're they're they're weakening themselves like zuckerberg did a few days back by while saying well you know the new documentary on uh on social media uh you know it is uh uh we're we're starting to to to deal with with content so so it is it's going to be under control but that's not the point that's the basic mcluhan point doesn't the content is not the issue it's the medium that's that's where the subject your consciousness is it doesn't matter what what are wha what what the particular uh motif emerges in in that in that element it's the element itself and how how do you even perceive this element you know like like he liked it uh uh often said uh you know we we're we're not sure who discovered water but we're pretty sure it wasn't a fish you know you need a counter environment like him he could perceive what was happening because well as a literate man he was outside the uh uh electric environment to some degree but unlike other illiterate man of his of his day he could also he could not he could not pretend that his his familiar categories uh of of of of of written texts you know shielded him from from the outside world of advertisement and and the actual life of the contents of the consciousness of the student not the contents but the the the the the fabric you know of the human mind as it existed uh in in the in in the the the young man she faced as as a professor see so uh it's not a matter of the of the contest but it's the the medium itself the the the electric uh uh this electric psyche that we have and uh i might get into scary territory too but i like to think of it in terms of an aggregor which is a term from from occultism about a kind of emergent collective being that that comes from an an entitlement and meshing uh uh uh of the of of i guess of different intentions intentionalities different consciousness that become that become a mind of their own so a civilization or a religion could be a negro gore or but these things you know they're they're it's it's uh is it's a psychic entity that that exists on its own well agrigore means from the from the herd you know it's something constituted from it's a herd mind that exists independently of its individual constituents yeah so that that thing that we're uh uh uh the drifting on or part of it has a mind of its own and it and it probably has some some kind of uh of uh uh of weird intentionality that we can't fathom you know it's a psychic entity that happens to have an electric body you know yeah but that's where i that's where to me at least under seeing this happen and like you said noticing it and noticing uh that its intention is beyond the individual intentions of those involved and you can see it like you can you can see that zuckerberg and uh what's his name uh the ceo of twitter they're they're they can't control their monster anymore they're it's completely out of control for them and they keep saying they'll do it but they can't and so you can notice that these things have a will of their own based on the very on the patterns that were set up you know in the beginning as they were coming to life and this is where to me i i it helps me to understand the idea of fallen angels like it really helps me to understand what fallen angels can mean how these how principalities fall can fall into into aggregate bodies and start to manifest patterns which are are disjuncted they're they're real and but they're they're they're destructive in the sense that they that they're feeding on their they're feeding on each other and they're they're not let's say they're feeding on the energy of the people almost like a weird parasite uh but it's not a parasite because it's we are the ones who are giving it its energy and for it to exist and because it's not individuated it's kind of unreal unvulnerable you know you can't pin it down and say oh if we pin it if if we if we if we strike it there no it won't stay there it's so diffused you know yeah well it's viral you know yeah you know um but and and so it to me it's very it's very fascinating to to see that mcluhan seems to have had even before the internet seems to have had a intuition of how this was kind of moving where it was going but in in order to not be too negative i think one of the things you explore in the article and one of the things i want to explore with you is because it is a breakdown of this gutenberg galaxy because this new electric world this new electro electric acoustic world of tribalism there is in that nonetheless an opening to talk about a more symbolic vision a more connected vision and a more even within the chaos yeah to introduce a more kind of holistic coherent vision of the world but you're living proof of it we are you know we you know we we're also uh you know uh uh psychic projections are already existing in that element and yet we point to something else uh maybe not outside but certainly inside each uh still existing embodied subjects see uh caught up as we are in in in this psychic flood uh so it's an element that is conducive to symbolism as well as con confusion and also to the confusion of symbolism uh so uh uh discernment and and and and and and and attempts at at uh uh a at an embodied focus such as what uh uh a spiritual or ritual practice can can provide is of the essence here if we want to to retain our humanity and and and and maybe recover uh uh and an integrity of a different kind than just uh going and merging with the the the the milestone uh of of the electric beast this would i mean a few decades ago if you would refer to the divine which what what would you show you would show a uh michelangelo 16 chapel you know uh a piece of meat handling and hanging in mid-air and and and gesturing to another piece of meat but in a wonderfully realistic detail and that would be it's the idea of the divine that each atheists still propagate you know that when they think of religion oh it's the it's what yeah that well people are generally spiritual now they they hardly bother with that what what they know to be spiritual is is an icon a mandala something from a a an archaic a culture a tribal culture a a well and a non-good gutenberg culture even a christian one yeah and that's because of the re-balancing of the censorium that's happened thanks to the breakdown of the gutenberg galaxy under the impact of the marconi constellation uh that is now coming to its full flowering uh uh uh with with with the uh are uploading in a in a global instantaneous uh electro electronic and cybernetic environment see so uh yes even even as as you know uh tiny microbes in the belly of the beast we're still an element of we can still regain some we can ourselves become the parasites of that larger very ambiguous being no but i agree i think that this is one of the reasons why i talk about what i call the double inversion or you know this the the fool at the end which turns things back which is that in the world that is in the world of the the beast like when the the let's say this beast has taken over you know those that constitute some form of normal hierarchy appear as a parasite that that finds some food actually in the belly of the beast to point people back towards the and and use i it's like that's why one of the reasons why i talk about monsters and peripheral things is because i can i i can because that's where we that's what we're in we're in this weird agora of of disparate elements which are nonetheless connected together in a kind of chaotic manner and manifest will you know that in that there's food to point back towards a kind of normal kind of normal order which also includes the monsters on the edge and includes you know the leviathan which which is this this uh this the beast that that are on the edge um and so i think that there's i think that there's hope maybe not for every everything but there's hope at least for a remainder or a small arc that can float inside the digestive tract of the beast yeah but we have to be a sort of nimble you know well of course yeah well mcluhan's you know classic simile for the situation in which it you know it's was the the the senate dude the maelstrom by by guerrero you know where this this this guy is is in a shipwreck his ship is is you know he's floating around the debris of his ship are are circling in this huge uh whirlpool that's emerging the ocean and falling into this black hole and but so he sees the end approaching with every turn every revolution of of the uh of the mindless spin and yet he observes among the debris some that that are floating well some some uh faster with the current some slower some actually even opposite the current he realizes that there are some counter currents there so he manages i believe to to swim to one that that flows in the opposite direction that goes up that was not down but uh up to the to the to the to the to to to the sea and beyond the pull of the milestone and that that was mcluhan's uh wager you know uh so if we understand the medium that we're uh immersed in that that's sucking us uh us into a a black hole imploding a bit before us uh we have to learn to swim it and to navigate the currents and cur counter currents and we first have to to observe it but not necessarily in the visual way we have to feel our way through it in a sense uh or actually bring to bear all our our senses uh uh uh including the the the distinct sense that that that uh mcluhan saw in faith itself he described it it describes faith uh catholic faith in his in his terms uh as something completely different from what people understand it's it's not a concept in the sense of a belief or a trust etc it's a percept a sense and sensibility to so to certain resonant harmonies between between uh realities visible and invisible uh that that that are like a sixth uh sense that that structures the the interplay of the of the five other ones the spiritual sense the percept uh which is not based on on distance but when but not on incomplete immersion either but but but in the uh awareness of the interplay and the resonance between different levels different currents etc so uh that's what we need to to develop and you know uh uh certain spiritual disciplines can are probably the best bet to to navigate that as as long as we're not too stuck in their form and we can also bring discernment to just the element and that we're immersed in the the residents resonance among the among its celtic debris the flotsam of of uh surrounding us see there are things that we can use to build a raft and maybe guide it to the surface all right well i think that on that note of hope it's probably a good place to finish our conversation uh and so i i just want to i want to thank you for this this moment i hope that everybody this has been useful to kind of begin or to think about uh this exploration mcluhan who was a strange in a way strange modern prophet who perceived what was happening and i think that i think it's now your call for us to be aware of where we are not be naive about the environment in which we are living so that we can navigate it as best we can so that we can change the depth into something better yeah so thanks for your time thank you i hope you enjoyed this discussion on marshall mcluhan as you might know the symbolic world is not just these videos but it's also a blog there is also a podcast and there's also a facebook group where people discuss all these different ideas on symbolism so make sure to check that out there is also a clips channel which breaks apart some of my ideas into smaller shareable clips and because of some of the subjects we're talking about youtube is not favorable to us and so make sure to subscribe and to share these videos on your own so that we can get these ideas out there for those who are watching this that's just coming out teespring is offering a full sale until the end of the weekend and so you can use the code word hayride to get 10 off symbolic world merchandise it's a good time to buy all those great christmas gifts for lovers of symbolism and so thanks everybody for your support and for your time and i will talk to you very soon you
