the global pandemic, thousands of creators
just couldn't make videos. It was brutal and I can't blame YouTube for not wanting to make a Rewind. But a lot of good things
still did happen this year. And let's be honest, it
just wouldn't be YouTube if we didn't have a rewind to make fun of. So, enjoy. (upbeat music) - [New Reporter] A lot of growing concerns about this deadly coronavirus

currently see on your screen is every single channel that hit 10 million subscribers in 2020. Not gonna lie, it's actually
more than I thought it was. And what you see on your screen now is every single channel that hit 1 million subscribers in 2020. Holy crap. My editor didn't feel
like typing them all out So here's just a video of me scrolling through the Excel sheet. Each one of these names represents someone that hits a million
subscribers in just 2020. Now to wrap things up,
I have a fishbowl full of random small channels. I'm going to draw a channel
like this and give them a plug. So Amelia and Bridie, shout out to you. You'll be linked in description below. Now, I just wanna say that I tried my best to cover the international
scene but to be honest, I only know how to speak English. So it's kind of hard for
me to include you guys but shout out to... how do you say this? - [Man Off Camera] Soyan Osman. - Soyan Osman with 241 subscribers. Shout out to you. I wanted to also give a
quick shout out to PewDiePie. My Rewind was heavily inspired by his Rewind that he did in years past. I even used the same editors he did. Felix, I love you. Thank you so much for the inspiration. If you're not already subscribed to him, you probably already are. And our final shout out of the Rewind, nalterdeeds with 1400 subscribers. Make sure you subscribe to all
three of the small creators. I thought it'd be a fun
way to end the Rewind. I'm sure it'd mean the world to them and thank you so much for watching. Oh! Oh, that's hot. (explosion) That's hot. (laughing)
