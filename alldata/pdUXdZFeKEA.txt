we all had a giant bucket of cold water thrown on us when Nvidia announced the pricing for their new RTX 4000 Ada Lovelace series of gpus and it would be easy to blame the outrageously high msrps on inflation and corporate greed don't get us wrong those two factors almost certainly have something to do with the price tags but let's spend the next few minutes diving a little bit deeper okay let's just take a little look here okay first off let's parse out just how bad this is in 2020 the RTX 3080 was announced at a starting MSRP of 700 and everyone was super hyped over getting a significant leap over the previous generation's Flagship for the same price but you know what happened next bots in the service of crypto miners snatched up what little Supply there was and the rest of us were left to join months-long waiting lists or buy from scalpers on eBay we hate those guys but here in the present with crypto mining crashing and used cards flooding the the market many folks were hoping the Ada lovely series would be relatively affordable but the 16 gigabyte RTX 4080 starts at twelve hundred dollars a 72 percent price increase over the 3080 and that isn't even taking the aforementioned inflation into account but hold on Riley what about the other 4080 that starts at only nine hundred dollars what are you talking about an astute observation dear viewer as you know Nvidia is selling two versions of the RTX 4080 One features 12 gigabytes of vram while the other features 16 and the 12 gigabyte version is the one that starts at 900 but if we look closely here there's way more differences under the hood than just the ram the beefier 16 gigabyte revision has over 2 000 more Cuda cores as well as a wider memory bus so even if 12 gigabytes of vram is enough to handle high quality textures you're not getting anywhere close to the same maximum performance as the 6 16 gig model a fact you can even see on a benchmark results chart Team Green itself released some fans are even going so far as to call the 12 gig version nothing more than a re-badged 70 series card sold at a markup because yeah the architecture is obviously newer but it comes with fewer Cuda cores than the last gen RTX 3080 and to top it all off these are just starting prices as third-party cards from aibs which make up the vast majority of the market are virtually certain to be more expensive all this is a real shame since even though the 3000 Series was generally well received it was also roundly criticized for being short on vram compared to what modern AAA titles demand even at the high end so if you're trying to snag a 4000 series card just so you can get more vram well I hope you've got some Deep Pockets and if not I want to cut a couple new ones but what's behind the price increases in the first place we'll tell you more about that right after we thank you green for sponsoring this video yougreen's Digi Nest 100 watt power strip is designed to be the last power strip you'll ever need the power strip uses gallium nitride technology to quickly charge devices and offers three USBC ports One USB a port two three-pronged plug ports and a single two-pronged port up top all in a wonderfully compact design making it the perfect desk companion for all your devices so don't wait grab your own Digi Nest 100 watt power strip from ugreen using the link in the description even though Nvidia isn't just gonna spill all the ins and outs of its pricing strategy we have a good idea of what's going on here CEO Jensen Wong has come out and publicly blamed Rising prices on the dramatically increasing costs of silicon Wafers and has also pointed out that performance per dollar is much better than past Generations but that latter argument is you know exactly how nearly all advancements in technology works so let's get away from nvidia's official statements it's no secret that since the crypto crash earlier this year there's been a glut of old RTX 30 series stock that both Team Green and its Retail Partners that have purchased graphics cards wholesale really want to clear out I mean Newegg is even giving away free monitors if you buy an ampere GPU therefore both the high end of the new 4000 series and the existing 3000 stock are going to be on the market at the same time Nvidia is effectively positioning the 4000 series cards at the top of one combined product stack hence the 4000 series higher prices Nvidia seems to be using them as a tactic to nudge some budget conscious folks towards buying an older gen card to clear out their inventory but what about supply of the new cards could the high prices be an attempt by team green to ensure they don't run out of cards like what happened back in 2020 this isn't very likely considering the pandemic seems to be winding down down GPU crypto minings on life support and the gpus themselves are now being made by tsmc instead of Samsung in other words many of the factors that seriously cut into Supply last time around other than actual high demand from gamers are now gone and even with the 4000 series admittedly impressive performance increases on paper it's not like gamers are chomping at the bit to get their hands on something new the way they were when the 3000 lineup launched or for the next two years of supply shortages since the 2000 series was widely considered an overpriced disappointment and the lack of Supply constraints could end up being good news in the months after the November launch since Nvidia may be forced to lower prices once they move some of the 3000 Series stock and once they face competition from AMD we'll be launching their Radeon 7000 cards that same month sadly if you want a shiny new Ada Lovelace card for the holiday season you most likely will have to Fork over lots of cash don't forget about budgeting for a new power supply maybe we should all just give up on PC gaming you know go outside find a cool stick play with it we'll launch a new channel called stick Wiki hey thanks for watching this video okay I'm just gonna live you like the video you're going to like it like it if you dislike it get it done dislike in there check out videos
