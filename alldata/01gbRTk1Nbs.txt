hi everyone in this episode we'll be creating a simple sword and shield model to go along with our handsome hero okay so in the player blend file I'm gonna go onto a new layer just press shift C to Center the 3d cursor and then shift a and add in a circle and I'll bring up the options with f6 and I just want to turn the number of vertices down to something like eight perhaps rotate this 90 degrees and scale it down because it's a little bit massive at the moment then go into edit mode and just extrude this out along the y-axis to create the grip of the sword and I also want to extrude out just a little pommel shape here so I'll just extrude this a bunch of times and scale it and just make something interesting like that I guess should be fine I'll press F to fill in that face at the back and then of course you can see that this is but it's normals inverted so I'll just select everything and ctrl n to flip the normals I'd also like to squish this on the x-axis so just scale it like so and then at the front here and basically alt right click to select that loop and extrude this out just along the y-axis like so and then I'll fill that in okay going into object mode I'm going to add in a cube and this is going to form the guard of the sword to protect our heroes fingers I want this to be sort of diamond so I'll just rotate this 45 degrees along the z axis and then I'm gonna move that in there scale it up just so that it meets nicely with the grippier and then scale this along the z axis something like that I'll maybe quickly go into edit mode add a loop in the center here and I'll delete these faces for the bottom half and just go into the modifiers and add a mirror modifier along these access all right so now when I extrude out this top and of course gets married at the bottom and we can just flare this out a little bit just to make it a bit more interesting to look at okay this is maybe a little bit big at the moment I'll just scale it down a tiny bit and scale it on the z-axis specifically as well okay next I'd like to create the blade so going into object mode I'll create a plane object just rotate this 90 degrees I'll move this out to the frontier and then from front view I'm going to scale this down and I want to first of all design the profile of the blade so basically what a cross section of it would look like so let me add a loop down the center here and I'll press T to bring up the tool shelf and just in the options menu an able X mirror so that I can just grab one of these vertices here and quickly design what this would look like so I guess I want it to be nice and sharp at the bottom and then I can maybe be a little duller at the top something like that I think would be good okay so then from side view we can just scale this out to the size we want and move this back like so and then just extrude it out along the y-axis all right I'm not really sure how long I want this to be at the moment maybe something like that is reasonable once again we've got these inverted normals or just select everything and ctrl n okay this is maybe a bit thick at the moment so I'll just scale it in on the x-axis and that's starting to look quite good I do want to curve the blade a little bit in the fashion of say a scimitar so in object mode I'm going to add in a curve specifically a path curve and if we go into edit mode on this curve you can see that it's currently pointing out to the left here so I'll go back into object mode and just rotate this negative 90 degrees along the z-axis so now you can see it's pointing forwards and also move this along the y axis just so that it sits at the base of the blade so let me just keep moving this back like so all right and now I'm going to select the blade object and add a curve modifier and I wanted to curve based on that NURBS path we created now currently this is offset weirdly so let's just go into the path here go into edit mode and I'm going to select the vertex at the base here just press shift s and move the cursor to that selected vertex and then in object mode I'll press shift ctrl alt C and move the origin to the 3d cursor all right I'll select the blade as well and move its origin to that point too so that now everything is lined up correctly okay now if we select the curve in edit mode we can start playing with this but currently the blade isn't able to deform nicely because it doesn't have any loop cuts so let's go into the blade object into edit mode ctrl R and just add in a bunch of vertical cuts like so and alright we can then go on to the curve once again and we can now start playing with this all right so I'll curve it up like so and we can also scale the blade at each of these different points not with s but rather with OTS like so so at the tip here I want to scale it to zero so I'll press alt s followed by zero and then let me just move that to the point there so it comes to a nice sharp point and I'll just start playing with each of these vertices of the curve until get roughly what I want and maybe the blade can be a little bit longer so I'll move this out and then on the actual blade object will have to scale this on the y-axis as well okay I'm just going to tweak this curve a little bit more I guess that's not too bad maybe curve this a little bit more dramatically but I think that's basically looking okay so on the blade object I'm now going to apply the modifier and I'll come to the tip here and I can just select these vertices and just make it as sharp as I want by scaling that down even more then I'd like to give this some sort of nice stylized spike over here so the way I want to do this is by selecting a vertex and then turning on proportional editing with over so that I can and move this all up but I don't want it to affect the bottom of the blade so I'm going to go into face mode quickly and I just want to alt right click to select the edge of the blade but I don't want any of these faces at the bottom to be selected so I'll press C and then middle Mouse drag to just deselect all of these ones I don't want here like so and I don't affect the tip either so let me just deselect that and I'll press shift H to hide everything but those selected faces and then going into vertex mode I'll select the one that I want to make a spike and with proportional editing turned on I can move this up a little bit like so maybe that isn't the right mode for the proportional editing to get the effect I want so undo that and let me turn on the sharp mode all right that's more the kind of spike I was hoping for all right so now that I've got that I can press alt H to unhide this and we can see I've got this nice dramatic spike it's maybe a little bit overboard so let me just undo that and maybe make it a little bit more subtle all right that's looking nice I am just quickly go to delete this curve object since we don't need that anymore okay now I'd like to just continue tweaking this a little bit so this guard piece is quite big compared to the rest of the sword so I'll turn off proportional editing quickly and then just scale this down a tiny bit on everything except the z-axis like so all right and then on this handle I'm just going to scale this front part down on the x-axis of which so that it just joins a little bit more nicely okay I think and the blade is maybe not entirely going into the guards let me just shift that back a tiny bit and are also quite like a little metal piece over here to just give the idea that is sort of holding the blade in place so let me add in a new cube object and I'll scale that down and move it out to the side well let me actually do that in edit modes that the origin remains in the center because I want to mirror this across to the other side as well and let me just scale that and place it nicely I'll move it out along the y-axis and bring it to a bit of a point there and bring it in along the x-axis a tiny bit as well okay I think that looks good so let me now go ahead and apply the mirror modifiers on both of these objects and I'll then select all of the objects and press ctrl J to join them into one and I'm then going to re-enable in the player layer and we can see that the sword is a tiny bit out of scale so let me just make this a more reasonable size I'll position it in the hand of the player like so we can see that the handle is a little bit too long perhaps so let me tweak that all right I'd like the origin point of the sword to be in the middle of the handle so let me go to face mode and just ultra click to select the faces of the handle their shift s move the cursor to the selected faces and then an object mode shift ctrl alt C move origin to 3d cursor so that's not the pivot point of the sword okay I would like to give this some color so let's go into the materials tab here I'll add the metal material and also create a slot for the dark metal so I'll assign the dark metal to say the pommel here and whatever you want to call this piece as well as maybe the tip of the guard and let me also select both of these little pieces here I don't know if there's a name for those and just assign that all right then I want the blade to be sort of gray metal so I'm gonna have to create a new material for that I'll call this blade and make that some sort of gray just select the blade and assign that and then to maybe make it look a little bit sharper we can create a blade highlight material and that's just going to be an intense or white and then I go to face mode and just alt right click along these two edge loops and assign the highlight to that all right that looks nice and shiny so let me quickly select the sword object and just control a apply the rotation and the scale and now we can move on to making the shield so and once again gonna go on to a new layer and press shift C and then add in a NURBS surface all right I'm going to rotate this negative 90 degrees that is just facing forwards like so and then in edit mode I'm going to go into the surface options here and just make it extend all the way out to the end of its bounds and then I'd like to mirror this along the x-axis so let me just select these vertices along the left edge and delete those or move this just across the centerline add a mirror modifier enable clipping and just bring these two halves together like so all right when I want to create the shape of the shield so you can just start moving these vertices around to get something that we're happy with so I'm going to go for a sort of kite shield shape something like this is getting close I guess alright maybe just go to a side view and make this a little less balaji and I can select some of these vertices here and just bend these just try and get a nice curve like so I think that's already looking pretty much how I want it so I'm going to add a solidify modifier to just give this a bit of thickness and maybe ramp that up a tiny bit all right we'll do some last tweaking but I think that's looking okay so what I'm going to do now is go into object mode and then press alt C which is going to bring up this conversion menu and I want to create a mesh from this surface so I'll select that and now if we go into edit mode you can see we've got this mesh but it's got quite a lot of faces at the moment so I'm actually gonna go into object mode and undo that and go into the surface options here and I just want to turn down the resolution maybe two three on the U and V axes so you can see u is the vertical axis and V is the horizontal access anywhere that looks okay so I'm gonna press alt see once again convert this to our mesh and now you can see that's a little bit lower resolution and I'm going to go into face mode I just want to alt right click on one of these edges on the rim to just select this entire edge loop and we'll press E and right click and then press alt s just to fatten this a little bit and I now want to select all of these around here and this is going to be a sort of metal rim for the shield the rest of the shield is going to be made out of wood so in the materials I am going to choose maybe the e I think will actually create a new material for this actually I'll call this metal underscore gray just make this some sort of darkest gray like so and then I'll press ctrl I to invert the selection and I want to create another new material called wood and this will be some sort of brown of course and they try assigning that turn off the specularity it looks quite okay I think maybe just tweak that color a tiny bit but I'm fairly happy with that it might be nice to make some proof like emblem on the front of the shield you could have force do that using a texture that that might make the most sense but I'm gonna actually make it out of a mesh so I'm gonna add in a plane and from side view me to rotate this 90 degrees and just bring it forward on the y-axis and then from front view I want to mirror this on the x and z axes so I'm going to cut it into four parts and in face mode I'll just and delete in these three and then add a mirror modifier mirroring on X and Zed I changed the rotation so I'm basically quickly go into object mode and apply the rotation there alright now we can scale this down except let me enabled clipping first all right something like that I'm basically making a simple cross emblem because I'm not feeling particularly creative today you maybe flare it out at the ends like so just something nice and generic and then little crazy material for this I'll just call this emblem and this is gonna be some sort of red maybe like that and I want to make this actually wrap onto the surface of the shield so it's going to need some more vertices to be able to do that so I'll just select everything and just subdivide it that might be sufficient so now we're going to add a shrink wrap modifier and the target object will be the shield I've been neglecting to name these objects it's a bit confusing let me quickly name this shield instead of surf thatch so now we can choose the shield object for that and I'm going to just project it like so so now it's projecting that onto the surface of the shield so I cannot just add a solidify modifier to just give that a tiny bit of thickness so that actually sticks out okay yes so that looks quite nice okay so we could still tweak this a bit if we wanted so I might make this a little bit pointy at the ends here like so and then if we go into object mode we can see it wraps back onto the object all right I'm not going to do anything at the back of the shield like any sort of handle or whatever just go to leave it as is so I don't really want to apply these modifies because I might want to change the emblem later on so instead of joining these objects I'm descriptive rather parent this object to the shield so now it's like there one object and then I'm going to unhide the player and the sword layer I'll scale this down I think my character is not actually going to be left-handed let me shift this over to his right hand and move the shield over here it is actually roughly the correct size I think maybe a tiny bit bigger smaller and that's actually probably perfect so I will just apply the rotation and scale of the object and that is now done although maybe the shield would sort of go better with the armor if it had a bit of that purple in it so in the materials I might replace this gray metal with the let's try the dark metal that's a bit too dark I'll just try the regular purple metal now ties into the theme a little bit better I think that works quite nicely alright so there is everything for this video in the next episode will of course be animating some nice attack animations but until then Cheers
