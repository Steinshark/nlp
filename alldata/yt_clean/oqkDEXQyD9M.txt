How did you &gt;&gt; MICHAELS: Well honestly, back when I first was no such thing as a celebrity wrestler. like it is now. It was very localized to states, I was raised in San Antonio, and in San Antonio There was what they called Southwest Championship first time I got to stay up late, all the shows, all the sudden this reel started. And They opened the show, and I was just mesmerized it would combine the two worlds that I think play acting and wrestling around with his just in awe of it. And I went out and told be a pro-wrestler when I grow up.&quot; And she by the time I graduated high school, I hadn't to let me try it. I was attending a university, summer. I said, Dad, I honestly feel like try this now. I was 19, and I felt like if And we bothered a bunch of people. A gentleman I had--which was some clothes and a television and wrestled my first match in 1984 in Lake &gt;&gt; NASSER: Wow, and it took off from there. &gt;&gt; MICHAELS: Yeah, and it was localized territories, time, they had gone with their first wrestle started to grow. Vince McMahon started to the goal. And then what you saw was there television. That's how old I am. Cable television get nation-wide coverage. The AWA was on ESPN, you needed to get to a higher level. Sent AWA called, and I went up there and started place we got national coverage. And then, the WWE in 1988. Started out as a tag-team. just took off from there, and honestly never &gt;&gt; NASSER: Wow, so recently, you came to know new chapter in your life. Tell us about your &gt;&gt; MICHAELS: Well, again, in some respects, funny hearing recently. Now it was 15 years 1988, again, after concurring a great deal have all sorts of material and worldly success, day is long. And I was raised in a conservative, personally wasn't turning out to be even the shy kid that I was when I started wrestling. never wrestle again. Went home and got even say, that woman He gave me. I was fortunate the sun rose and set with her. Saw her, got don't do this at home--after knowing her her to marry me. She was crazy enough to say And an Elvis impersonator walked her down we got married. It is. We were two wretches that, we found out we were going to have our &gt;&gt; NASSER: What happens in Vegas sometimes &gt;&gt; MICHAELS: It went fast folks. Oh, yeah. later I think we're still rolling along just it didn't take long for her to see. And she born-again Christian, but again, sort of not, with it too much. And clearly she could see conversation she asked me, you know, we were in Jesus? And I said I was raised Catholic, into this marriage she realized that the question A lot of people can--you can sort of believe has since learned to rephrase that question, And she just, right away, she knew where she She was married to a gentleman that was not back in Bible study, and unbeknownst to me, get in the closet and get on her knees and I was in a semi-incoherent state, and I was him. He was two-years-old, and I could faintly the first day that I realized that he was broke my heart. It broke my heart, and that in my life, I finally loved something more had--and that was my child and my wife. And that I was not the man they needed me to be. Catholic. It was in that building somewhere. day, and I said--. I didn't know what I was Bible study, and so I came in and I said I'm I looked like this, and at first I think she a gentleman stuck his head out of his office, the prayer of salvation, wept like a baby, her, I mean I gave her the entire thing, and That's the day she told me about her praying, she didn't tell me. She said, you know, I real, you needed to come to it for yourself. about that woman then I was all those years that I let everybody know, because every time So, it's always very important to her that to me. She's mine, and she did something for other than my own mother, that found me as said, that's the power of what prayer is an &gt;&gt; NASSER: Praise the Lord. God used your and then eventually bring you to him. How faith? I mean you got saved and then immediately in your life. &gt;&gt; MICHAELS: I did, well, and that's because months before I even started attending. It it. I told everybody. I shouted from the rooftops. sun, and then all of the sudden I started really not--. The whole Jesus thing makes to be private, and yada yada yada. And by said so much, I just figured, heck, when you're for me, and again, it's one of the aspects sit back there with you guys and say, no, again--. Like on one hand you go, don't be me is to be invited to places like this, because that. And again, it's--. That, never again, told everybody already, and then it was just I guess in like a good way now, but just like them nuts, I didn't care. And now that same sort of used in a far more positive direction. from a guy who sort of gets a kick out of &gt;&gt; NASSER: Well, you're at home here when that you make Him known, and you're not ashamed grateful for you.

And I always words back then, but I always believed that the most influential medium in the world, And the church relationship with media was in the form of a boycott. And now that's changing, which is helping people learn how to use media I was in college. So, when I got out of college, for 10 years making movies and doing okay. popularity. And then in 2010, Harvest Bible where I had grown up, and yeah. Okay. And laughed at first, because I never thought the church wanted to make movies, wanted to to see the Cubs win the World Series. So, Dallas Cowboys who lost last week, we actually So, long story short, The Resurrection of is putting out, and we partnered--. How I what we were doing, along with another production saw a short movie that I did for our church's they loved it, and they were kind of wanting and so a wrestling company, and a horror film to make The Resurrection of Gavin Stone, a church. They never asked us to change any right up front, the message, obviously, and they were like, well you guys are the experts a thing.

I do want to tell there at the mall, and so we'll be giving but it's a rare thing that there would be &gt;&gt; JENKINS: Yeah, it's not always the case on purpose, and so--. Maybe I shouldn't have world, I think we protestants are so earnest, a message, and to be on point, and to deliver we're scared that humor's going to get in case the movie is about an outsider. It's so when we've done test screenings over the movie just as much as churchgoers and have see the movie through his eyes. And so, they world, and learning the language of &quot;Christianese&quot; helps, I think, take the sting out of it a and you're trusting on me. We had a screening they were laughing their heads off through the film a little bit more, and you're a little does come--and even there's a little even gut punch--it seems like people are that feel like they see it coming from a mile away. &gt;&gt; NASSER: Shawn, what drew you to this role this particular role? &gt;&gt; MICHAELS: My goodness, well reading the the role of Doug. And Doug wasn't a big leap I could easily relate to. However, I never shouldn't have. And so, it was easily something I think for your first film, it's in an environment and so there were just--. There was nothing appreciated the humor. I really did, because in the position of Gavin. It's been, again, for the first time and not understanding so and the people talking. How are you doing? blessed and highly favored.&quot; I'm like, I'm me, I had never heard a lot of that, and so there are Christians making a movie that, like it's going to make people uncomfortable. that I could still things from both sides. I thought this movie just fit it perfectly. &gt;&gt; JENKINS: Well we brought a clip that we look at it for the first time. But it's brief, bit of Shawn's character too, because Shawn's his life around and is now this humble volunteer. love Gavin. And even when Gavin is a little faith, even though he's claiming to be a Christian off, Doug just assumes the best about him. invites him over to his small group and welcomes &gt;&gt; NASSER: Let's watch this clip together. &gt;&gt; (VIDEO): Deep dish! &gt;&gt; DOUG: Gavin, you want to pray it up? Pray, &gt;&gt; STONE: Yeah, let's--. All right guys, battle each day, we know it will not be easy, may try to take away our lives, they will this glorious feast of cheese and bread, pizza, &gt;&gt; DOUG: All right then. &gt;&gt; JENKINS: I love it, all right then. All You can make it work! &gt;&gt; NASSER. It just feels like a really easy too, right? &gt;&gt; JENKINS: Oh, yeah, we have heard from people, people saying if there was a church like the heard directly from people who said I haven't me want to come back, and that's the point not--being able to relate to the main character that, Christian and non-Christian. &gt;&gt; NASSER: And from the clip we saw and from watching the whole movie, obviously, you have like you're really gifted in that. What's ring, or are you doing charity work? What's &gt;&gt; MICHAELS: Judging by what I did early with on the wall. No, I'm very thankful for my then and do stuff and kick somebody, and yell be the extent of that. I retired to go home doing that. I will likely--we've talked about things of that nature, which is the younger about just, sharing your experiences and helping hand I get in trouble at home, because I sort know, you're jinxing it.
