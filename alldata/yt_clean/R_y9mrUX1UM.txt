All right. We're where the bigger the ramp is, Everyone knows in order to get to a ramp, you have to be ready Here we go. Okay, There are five different ramps. Oh, wow. Each ramp is related to an element. There's water, fire, earth, And I. Okay, this ramp is going And I have to find out Oh, okay. I can land this. This is fine. Oh. Whew. Okay, I may need to- so I have to find out But in order to unlock all the ramps, that each ramp offers. So, first- Ow! There's no way I can stop this car. It's impossible. And then land it. Oh, come on. Obviously, that must be So it's kind of cool that I'm actually, Okay, early bail. Here we go. Right now. That looks good. Ow! Why am I so slippery? It's all the sunscreen. Basically, every morning I'm getting pretty close If you notice, there's a I don't need this car- Oh, hold on. I have an idea. I have an idea. I have an idea. Okay, here's my plan. One of the cars I bailed out on Come on, baby. I'm going to try and line cars up and then In case you're wondering, This is called the I.Q. Islands. Here we go. Here That's how you do it. Okay, so now we can grab the bike Oh, that's kind of a cool bike. So now we can grab the bike and we can start of the challenge that's giving us a bigger ramp, I don't know, I guess we end up with the the farthest ramp I get to transcend time and space. All right. So how does this work? Do I have to.... Or I can just drown immediately. That's fine. All right. Here's the plan. You got to go around in a circle and then slowly work your way up I'm assuming that's All right, you ready? First one. No problem. Okay, I can just go on these islands here, right? Hold on. Check this out. I can actually use Danny has not learned the Anti-Cheat All right, so ramp it and. Oh, that one's actually kind of far. All right. I may have to run Okay. Just keep going. Keep going, keep going. Keep going now. Yeah, there it is. Okay. Do I have to get way up there? I don't even know if I can jump that high. He gave me an extra strip So I can get more speed. But that looks relatively unfair. I don't know if I can jump that high. All right, well, All right, so I'm going to yeetley-deet myself over here. Perfect. I have to make sure that I hit this Otherwise, I'm going to end up We're going to get as much space Yeah, this looks good. Okay, I need to start this way earlier. I just lost part of my hypothalamus. Jokes on you, Danny. I'm just going to. I'm starting now. There we go. There we go. Here we go. Here. Okay. Yeet! Okay, you can make it. Sweet! So from here, it looks like two.... So there's another strip. I don't know if I can land I could just go for the. Yeah, I'm All right. Speed, speed, speed. Good landing. Nice. Okay, so now we've got another Oh, there's a little hidden one here. That's a big ramp. Wait, what am I supposed to do? I need to look at something. Okay, If I wait, I'm assuming I can, like, skip- Oh, that's where I started. Okay, so if I mess this up, I actually go All right, we need to wait for that ramp, Okay. Right now. Oh, no! Too early. Too early. Too early. Too early. Okay. Are you.... Noooooo!!!! I've got to hit this perfectly. Okay that looks good. That looks good. That looks good. And, yes, way back. We're going to float Float it, float it. Look Yeah! A checkpoint!!! Hold on. So you don't actually go over this one. You go into it and all. Oh, there's holes everywhere. That's a really small opening. Am I gonna have to, like, thumbnail hole myself through that? That is not a lot of space. Well, there's one thing I'm good at. It's squeezing my body into places To me, the motorcycle. And if you don't like it, for the next vehicle Gonna do this early. Okay. Halfway. Halfway. Now. Perfect. Yes. Oh, that's hot. Uhhhhhhhhh..... What do I- Oh, okay. Okay, cool. So that's got to be the opening All right. So we're going to gain I don't want to screw this up All right, wait for it. Infinite speed. Oh God I'm too early- *laughter* I know what it's like I was stuck to the prop. I can't get back up. I can't die. Someone use some RainX. You can't help. Here Okay, let's try that again, All right, here we go. Okay. This one looks good. This one looks good. Whoa. Huh? What? Did he get rid of the water over here? He turned off the water It's got a ramp over here, too. I think it was just Danny, you almost ruined my entire career. Okay, so I hope that this ramp literally goes to the the the teleport I assume it does. Right. Like you wouldn't mess with me All right, cool. All right, we're doing the fire ramp Oh, my car is on fire. Obviously, I assume the epileptic one over on Let me try and turn the camera away So you guys don't have to look at it. Fire is fat- Well, it definitely has great aerodynamics, but I don't think we got far enough. When I'm not a screw up. Oh, my God. Oh. All right, I'm just going to just. Is that a plane up there? Okay. I know where I'm supposed to land. We're almost there, but we're not quite There we go. Oh, yeah. Oh, this is happening. I mean, lean forward. Lean forward, lean forward. Looking good. Got a nice, long landing pad here aaaaaand..... No, no! Yeah, well, I guess when you hit a wall that kind of makes sense. Now remember what more distance whenever you're doing You can arc down a little bit. I don't want to overshoot it. Yeah, And sticks the landing. Perfect. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh. Oh. Alex, what did you make? That's kind of cool. Oh, it's a loopty loop of fire into a....... is that a wall transfer? It looks like a wall transfer of fire Oh, this is actually kind of awesome, huh? All right, let's do it. Are you ready? This is a pretty good car for this, too. It's got a decent wall. Ohhhhhhh..... I can't see where I'm going. Okay, the fire looks amazing, but Oh, hold on, I gotta stick this landing. You know, forget I ever said anything. All right, up. And. Annnnnd..... Oh fire.... I'm right back where I started. All right, we're trying this I don't know if this is I can't see anything. I'm literally just eating fire. I'm not going to lie. Fire. Oh. Doesn't taste great. Tastes like pain and regret. All right. This feels good. I don't want to go too far over to the left Yeah, I have a tendency Oh my God! Yes! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Okay, I can do this. And then it looks like there is a launch pad and then a second launch pad And then. I have no idea. Okay, now stay over to the left, All right, come out on the left. Not that far left. Not that way. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What a save. I lost too much momentum, though. Give it to me one time. Yes. Okay, stop! All right, I need to. I need to make sure what I'm doing here. So this is a launch wall ride into a launch wall ride transfer. Okay, so I have to do a flip eventually. All right. As much distance as possible. This car should get us enough speed. Perfect. Yeah. Oh, God. Okay. And then. Oh, no, I'm screwed. How do you like your burrito? I like it setting my entire body on fire, Okay, perfect. And now. Right, plug it. Flip land low. Nice. Is this one up or down? Okay, mid middle. I did that reverse. I went low and I should have went high. Okay, if I can get this perfectly though. Big loop riding the fire. The fire is in my hair. Well, the well, the fire has now replaced my hair because my hair onto the first wall ride. Okay, oh no! Nope. Okay, first, *nervous sounds* I'm pretty sure I can get enough First wall ride- Really? Land on the platform. Don't think, Gray, thinking is bad. You're highly allergic to it. Big flip. Perfect. This is this. I'm Don't think. Just do. Oh, yeah. Okay, okay, What happened? Why, why? Why, how? High stop sticks out. How are you supposed to go through it? I don't have to do it There's chopsticks the whole- Oh, wait. Oh, okay. Here's my plan. I'm I'm going to try and go bottom. I'm not going to lie if he puts stop That's sick. I've got that curl down like every time I don't want to skip Like that. I can use that cheat wall- Oh, no. I can use the cheat I can slam the side of my car Just not in the- They call me all day. Not because I- Make money all day. Just because I'll end up doing this All right. Transfer. Right, low. No, no, no, no, no, no. I was almost there. Okay. You can definitely go Land it. No! Beautiful landing. Transfer. Perfect. Third one. Land it. Low. I'm not giving up. Okay. Off the curl, Landed perfectly. Ride the fire. Twist land. Good. Stay up. Tire roughly onto the brown thing Stay on the brown thing. Oh, God! Oh, oh. Oh, yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Oh, my God. Into the next element. Wind. Got to be the best. Are you ready? Oh, yeah. Oh, I'm gliding. I'm totally gonna- Whoa! Oh, wow. Oh, my God. This thing has wings. See? He's been chugging All right, passing the- Well, what- Where do I land? What is that? What- Oh, God, no. Oh, God, no. Is that all wind turbines? Are you kidding me? *weeping in despair* Ow! Wind! Get it? I hate you. Did you make a wall ride out of wind turbines? He made a wall ride out of wind turbines. It's just solid wind turbines. Oh, my God. There's more. How does this not crash the game? All right, let's do it. Oh, my God. I'm going to regret this. All right. Wall riding on wind turbines. Oh, not at the train! I had to come down here real quick How hard can it be? Oh, my God. Oh, no.
