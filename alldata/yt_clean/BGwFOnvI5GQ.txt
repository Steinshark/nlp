- [Link] Welcome to Good Mythical More - [Link] of what you have in your life. ((Laughing)) - [Rhett] Say what again? - [Link] More of what you have in your life. - [Link] Which is us. - [Link] I presume this is not the first video - [Link] somebody's ever seen of us. - [Link] Is there anybody watching, - [Link] that's never seen a video of ours - [Link] and this is the first one? - [Rhett] Every single video, - [Rhett] there's at least one person - [Rhett] who is the first video of ours - [Rhett] they're ever clicking on. - [Rhett] That is a statistical necessity. - [Rhett] It is a mathematical necessity. - [Rhett] So, hello. Hello. - [Link] It is not a necessity. - [Rhett] No, it is. - [Rhett] I've done the research. - [Rhett] To know that when you have 22 people - [Rhett] in a classroom, - [Rhett] the chances that two of them - [Rhett] will have the same birthday. - [Rhett] Is like 100% or something like - [Rhett] No, it's not 100%, but it's like, - [Link] more than 50% - [Link] Now we believe you. So - [Rhett] Hey, I'm telling you. - [Link] Hey, don't poke me. - [Rhett] I have to say hello to the person - [Rhett] who's watching us. - [Rhett] They've already quit - [Rhett] because we started arguing. - [Rhett] We had that one person - [Rhett] We had you. - [Link] Because I'm not welcome here - [Rhett] and you're gone. - [Link] I don't feel very seen. - [Rhett] We're going to make chili. Chili. - [Rhett] We're going to make chili for Jordan. - [Link] I'm going to make the best chili. - [Rhett] They're like who's Jordan? - [Rhett] See? There's too much to explain. - [Rhett] Just go on about your life. ((Laughing)) - [Rhett] But first, let's do something - [Rhett] off this wheel. - [Rhett] It has nothing to do with anything - [Rhett] else we're going to do. - [Rhett] How did we get here? - [Link] Who is I? Me and you? What? - [Rhett] I don't know. - [Rhett] List them all, other ways to say - [Link] Why is that desk so big, - [Link] and we're both sitting behind it? - [Rhett] Other ways to say "Darn It" - [Rhett] Dang it. - [Link] Crap mitt. - [Rhett] Okay, okay. - [Rhett] I guess that technically is - [Rhett] another way to say it. - [Rhett] Dag, I think it has to start with a D, - [Rhett] Dagnabbit. - [Link] Dadgummit. - [Rhett] Damn it. - [Link] Shoot. - [Rhett] It feels like the rules, - [Rhett] it's like I can say any word at this point, - [Rhett] like Oh! - [Link] No. - [Rhett] Yeah, yeah. - [Link] Dang it to heck. - [Rhett] All right. He wins. See? - [Rhett] That's how it works, new person. - [Rhett] We play a game - [Rhett] that has undefined rules. - [Rhett] Declare a winner. - [Link] Jordan Myrick, come on in here - [Link] and tell the people what I did. - [Jordan] I'm Jordan. - [Jordan] I'll tell them. Let me tell them. - [Link] Tell them what I did. - [Jordan] So before we started, - [Jordan] I was like, Link, - [Jordan] what are we going to land on - [Jordan] when you spin the wheel? - [Jordan] And Link said, List 'Em All - [Jordan] and then that's what he landed on. - [Rhett] I don't believe you. - [Jordan] I don't know what to say. - [Jordan] That would be an unhinged thing - [Jordan] for me to lie about. - [Link] What are the chances? - [Jordan] Someone tell us, - [Jordan] what are the chances? - [Rhett] The chances are - [Rhett] it is a mathematical necessity - [Rhett] that in this particular timeline - [Rhett] that would happen. - [Rhett] I'm impressed. - [Link] So, you know, - [Link] what are the best brands of foods - [Link] that can go on chili - [Rhett] And it makes us cry. - [Jordan] Yes. Yeah, for that one new person, - [Jordan] I work at Sporked - [Jordan] and we eat everything at the grocery store - [Jordan] and tell you what is the best. - [Jordan] And today we're going to do a draft - [Jordan] where you are going to make me - [Jordan] the best loaded chili. - [Jordan] And I will pick a winner. - [Jordan] And then after, - [Jordan] I will get a little prize. - [Link] Which is the chili? - [Jordan] I guess. I don't know. - [Jordan] I don't normally get a prize, but - [Link] You're going to get the prize, - [Link] which is the best chili you've ever had. - [Link] The one I'm going to make you. - [Rhett] This has become quite a competition. - [Rhett] I feel like there's been a lot. - [Rhett] I think it's been back and forth - [Rhett] almost every time. - [Rhett] We're pretty even at this point - [Rhett] because we track, - [Rhett] we compete at trying to impress Jordan - [Rhett] probably more than we compete - [Rhett] at anything. - [Jordan] It's awesome. - [Rhett] Have you noticed that? - [Link] I have noticed that. - [Link] I wish that you wouldn't have noticed it. - [Link] I don't like - [Rhett] Oh, you don't like to feel like you're trying? - [Link] I don't like to be seen as trying. - [Rhett] Oh, because you're not competitive. - [Link] And I'm not competitive and - [Rhett] He's not competitive. - [Link] It's pretty dadgum effortless on my part. - [Rhett] Well, I get to go first - [Rhett] because I did lose last time, - [Rhett] and I was listening you - [Rhett] and listening to you - [Rhett] during the main episode. - [Jordan] Okay. - [Rhett] And that's why I'm going to choose - [Rhett] as my base chili, the vegan chili. - [Jordan] There you go. That's I mean, - [Jordan] and that's a good vegan chili. - [Rhett] I'm a good listener. - [Link] I could not hear Jordan - [Link] once the light turned off. - [Jordan] That's so hurtful. - [Rhett] Well, this happened before the light. - [Jordan] Look at this chili. - [Jordan] Doesn't this look like meat chili? - [Rhett] It does. - [Link] I think that's why Christy is like - [Link] turn the lights off. - [Link] So she can't hear me. - [Jordan] Oh, you know? ((Laughing)) - [Jordan] I don't know if I'm allowed to ask - [Jordan] what I want to ask, so. - [Jordan] We'll all just think about it. - [Link] Just ask it. - [Link] Rhett doesn't have to answer it. - [Jordan] It's not for Rhett. ((Laughing)) - [Link] I've told you before, and I'll tell you again. - [Link] You can ask me anything. - [Rhett] Ask him. - [Jordan] Wow. Well, I guess if you say, you know, - [Jordan] she wants to turn the lights off - [Jordan] so she can't hear you. - [Jordan] Sounds like you are talking a lot - [Jordan] during intercourse. - [Rhett] The first time he had it with her, - [Rhett] he said this is free. - [Link] Yeah. I was pretty amazed - [Link] that the price tag was nothing. - [Rhett] Right, because he had paid - [Rhett] for sex up to that point - [Jordan] Sure. Hey, that's good and valid. - [Link] That's not true. I just had never had it. - [Jordan] Sure. Whoa, you lost, - [Jordan] you had sex with your wife - [Jordan] for the first time ever? - [Rhett] Yeah, me too. - [Rhett] I mean, my wife ((Laughing)) - [Rhett] My wife, yes. - [Jordan] Wow. I thought we were really - [Jordan] about to break a news story. - [Link] This is your first episode too? - [Jordan] This is my first episode. - [Link] We always talk about how - [Link] that I lost my wiener in a vagina ((Italian Music)) - [Rhett] Yeah. Thank you. - [Link] Where is my wiener? - [Link] It must be, it must be in the tunnel of love. - [Rhett] No. - [Link] Because I do not believe in - [Link] losing your virginity, - [Link] because it's a construct. - [Jordan] Sure. Yeah. - [Link] Virginity is a construct. - [Jordan] I just am always shocked - [Jordan] by how long both of you - [Jordan] have been with your wives. - [Jordan] That's so nice. - [Link] So are they. - [Rhett] Yes. It's because she cuts the lights off - [Rhett] and he shuts up. - [Rhett] Okay, Link, you have to pick your chili. - [Link] There is not another chili. - [Rhett] Yeah, there is. - [Link] Oh, here it is. Venison chili. - [Jordan] No, Dennison's chili. ((Laughing)) - [Link] Venison with a D. - [Rhett] It does look great. It does look great. - [Rhett] And like you said, - [Rhett] it's not that you won't eat it. - [Link] Lot of meat in this chili. - [Jordan] Yeah, it's a very meaty chili. - [Jordan] It's a great meat chili option - [Jordan] if you like meat. - [Link] But not deer meat. - [Jordan] It's not made with deer meat. - [Rhett] I know you like cheese - [Jordan] I do. - [Jordan] Who doesn't? - [Rhett] I mean, first of all, - [Rhett] I mean, putting pimento cheese - [Rhett] inside chili is super interesting - [Rhett] and I think it would be good, - [Rhett] but Kraft Mexican style four cheese blend - [Rhett] is what I put in my chili at home. - [Rhett] And it never fails. - [Rhett] It's thin, so it melts quickly. - [Link] Is that why you chose it? - [Jordan] Is that why I chose it? - [Jordan] Yeah, we think it's a great - [Jordan] shredded Mexican cheese. - [Jordan] It melts quickly. It's really cheesy. - [Jordan] It's so rich. It's nice. - [Link] It has no rBST hormone in it. - [Rhett] It has no Arby's in it. - [Jordan] No Arby's - [Rhett] No Arby's to be found in this chili. - [Rhett] That's a big bag. - [Link] Yeah, I think monogamy is ((Italian Music)) - [Link] Monogamy is the best type of agamy. - [Link] Every time I'm going to get me, - [Link] it's going to be a monogamy. - [Rhett] Did you say monogamy - [Rhett] is the best kind of agamy? - [Link] Yes, I did. Would you like a chili? - [Link] What do I like to put on my chili? - [Link] It would be a little bit too early ((Italian Music)) - [Link] Thank you. - [Link] Flavor twist because they'll get soggy. - [Link] I got to wait. - [Jordan] Wow. That's much more strategy - [Jordan] than you normally play with. - [Jordan] I love that. - [Link] Oh, gosh. - [Link] I got to go with the corn muffin, because - [Link] Oh, and I've knocked two off the board. - [Link] But can you help with that? - [Rhett] Now, Link, you don't have to immediately - [Rhett] insert the ingredient into the chili. - [Link] But you did. - [Rhett] Yeah, because it's chili and I want it to melt a little bit. - [Rhett] But you don't have to do that - [Rhett] because we've played by that rule before - [Rhett] is all I'm saying. - [Jordan] Let's get this back up here. - [Link] So corn bread. - [Rhett] Was a good call, Link. - [Link] But like chili without corn bread is like - [Link] is like - [Jordan] Come on, you got it. - [Link] Intercourse - [Jordan] Yes, say it. ((Italian Music)) - [Link] With the lights on. ((Laughing)) ((Italian Music)) - [Link] I like the lights off, sometimes. - [Link] Because I can talk. - [Rhett] Cause you can talk. - [Link] I can talk, - [Link] but I get to drink water either way. - [Jordan] I am finding out so much. - [Rhett] Yeah, but can't you drink water - [Rhett] before and after? - [Rhett] Like, why do you have to, - [Rhett] I mean, you're not - [Link] 4 hours is a long time - [Link] to not stay hydrated. ((Laughing)) - [Rhett] Mr. 13 minute quickie - [Link] I'm not the one - [Link] who keeps bringing that up. - [Link] Listen to our podcast. ((Laughing)) - [Rhett] You know what I want? - [Link] If you're into this. - [Jordan] I'm very into this. - [Jordan] I'm learning a lot about a culture, - [Jordan] that's not mine. ((Laughing)) - [Rhett] Well, it's not ours anymore. - [Rhett] Jordan, you know. - [Link] There's a lot growing on that culture. - [Rhett] I'm going to give you, - [Rhett] I'm going to think out loud here. - [Jordan] Great. - [Rhett] I may be giving Link - [Rhett] too much at this point. - [Jordan] I hear you, but that's okay. - [Rhett] So he didn't take cheese as his option. - [Rhett] And there's only one cheese - [Rhett] left on the board. - [Rhett] So, if I double cheesed, - [Rhett] that would be an incredible move. - [Rhett] Now he would be forced to move - [Rhett] to sour cream, - [Rhett] which would be the only move, - [Rhett] I'm thinking, like chess, you know? - [Jordan] Of course. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. - [Rhett] He goes sour cream. - [Rhett] I know that. I can say touche - [Rhett] to your sour cream with Greek yogurt - [Rhett] because a lot of people don't know - [Rhett] that it isn't as good as sour cream, - [Rhett] but it is a pretty damn, - [Rhett] darn good substitute. - [Jordan] I need you before you do anything, - [Jordan] Okay, no. Okay. Okay. Okay. - [Jordan] I was wrong. - [Jordan] I thought maybe sour cream - [Jordan] wasn't even on the board, - [Jordan] and I got scared, but it is. - [Jordan] It's just directly behind me - [Jordan] where I can't really see it. - [Jordan] Okay. - [Rhett] So ((Laughing)) - [Rhett] I feel like I'm going to do that. - [Rhett] I'm going to make that move. - [Rhett] I'm going to double cheese. - [Rhett] I'm gonna stick you with no cheese. - [Link] What's the refraction period - [Link] on the second cheese? - [Rhett] 13 minutes. - [Rhett] What do you mean? - [Link] I mean, can you really do that back to back? - [Rhett] Yeah, yeah, yeah. You can cheese twice. - [Rhett] Not as fast as I used to. - [Link] Why, did you start this or did? - [Jordan] Absolutely not. - [Link] Okay. I just thought it was a way - [Link] to get you in the chili - [Link] because of the whole stand up routine thing. - [Jordan] No I think it's - [Jordan] Listen, to take it back to chili, I love this. - [Jordan] I can cheese a bunch of times - [Jordan] so I think this is great. - [Jordan] I think it's perfect. - [Rhett] I was thinking about you. - [Rhett] I just wanted to be there for you. - [Link] I'm so jealous of that. ((Laughing)) - [Link] What am I going to do, y'all? - [Link] I can't cheese at all. - [Rhett] Maybe that's why you last so long. - [Matt Carney] You're going to have to fake cheese it. - [Link] is there fake cheese over here? - [Rhett] I mean, you're going to have to go - [Rhett] Cheetos, man. - [Rhett] I mean, you're in Cheetos world. - [Link] Yes, that's true. - [Jordan] So, wait, wait, wait, hold on, wait - [Link] Hold on, this was already this is off the, - [Link] oh, that's mine. ((Laughing)) - [Link] I got to get through this. Wait, wait, wait. - [Link] They said, wait, wait, wait. - [Link] Wait, wait, wait. - [Rhett] He wasn't listening. - [Jordan] I know, I know, I know. - [Rhett] He was thinking about - [Rhett] what he was going to say. - [Jordan] I know. - [Link] But what I said, it was good ((Laughing)) - [Link] I mean, it was worth it, right? - [Link] You said something about - [Link] sour cream and yogurt, - [Link] but if I don't take one of those, - [Link] I think that's what you said. - [Rhett] Can we turned the lights off? - [Rhett] This is confusing me even more. - [Link] What do I need? - [Jordan] Just go with your heart. - [Jordan] What would you like next? - [Jordan] What's something that sounds good next, - [Jordan] that you think I would like to eat? - [Link] Yeah, I will go with sour cream. - [Rhett] Okay, gosh. - [Rhett] You almost didn't go with sour cream. - [Rhett] You were handing this competition - [Rhett] to me if you didn't go with sour cream. - [Link] Yeah, yeah, that's what I was - [Rhett] Now, here's an interesting thing. - [Rhett] I'm pretty creamy at this point. - [Rhett] With the pimento cheese. - [Rhett] But I can also proportion this - [Rhett] in a way that I think will be palatable. - [Jordan] Yeah. You do have control - [Jordan] over the portioning, so - [Jordan] and the bite. - [Jordan] You get to craft the bite for me, so - [Jordan] and I want to know what's the strategy - [Jordan] of putting the sour cream on right now, - [Jordan] but not the cornbread? - [Link] I typically mix it up completely. - [Jordan] Okay, and, - [Jordan] but not with the cornbread? - [Link] And I wanted - [Link] Yeah, the cornbread's going to get too soggy. - [Rhett] I'm going to mix this. - [Link] But what I'm going to do is - [Link] I'm going to mix this up completely. - [Link] Matter of fact, I'm gonna go ahead - [Link] and do that, because - [Link] it's at its hottest. It's only getting colder. - [Rhett] Wow. Okay. - [Link] But I'm also going to give you the option - [Link] to eat some without the sour cream. - [Rhett] The thing about pimento cheese - [Rhett] is that it has cream cheese in it doesn't it? - [Jordan] Yeah, well no. - [Jordan] Well, I guess it depends on who makes it. - [Jordan] It's either cream cheese - [Jordan] and or mayonnaise. - [Rhett] Yeah, this is cheddar cheese - [Rhett] and then cream cheese. - [Rhett] So, that's an interesting thing - [Rhett] It's like, I might not need the yogurt - [Rhett] to answer the sour cream, - [Rhett] but I can end up double creaming him. - [Jordan] There you go. - [Rhett] So I double cheese myself, - [Rhett] and I double cream, Link. - [Jordan] Yeah. - [Link] I'm good with that. - [Rhett] Okay. Okay. All right. - [Rhett] More yogurt is not - [Rhett] going to make that any better, - [Rhett] is what I'm saying. - [Rhett] It's not going to do anything to you - [Rhett] except make it a little bit worse. - [Rhett] And I don't know if I need it - [Rhett] because of the pimentos, - [Rhett] and now I kind of feel like maybe - [Rhett] I feel like there is something here - [Rhett] that I know that you like - [Rhett] and I think will have a - [Rhett] transformational impact on this. - [Rhett] And that is the hot sauce. - [Jordan] Yum. I love hot sauce. - [Jordan] I like my food as spicy as possible. - [Link] And this particular hot sauce is? - [Jordan] Oh, this stuff is good. - [Link] Have we had it before? - [Link] I think maybe. It's really hot. - [Rhett] Oh yeah. - [Rhett] And have you had the burnt, - [Rhett] the black habanero one? - [Jordan] It's so good. - [Jordan] Do you want to try it? - [Link] No, thank you. - [Jordan] Okay. Do you want to try it? - [Link] I am now going to go for the - [Link] Cheetos Cheddar Jalapeno. - [Link] And now we can at least - [Link] taste some of these, just as it is. - [Jordan] These are really good. - [Link] This is going to give me my cheese, - [Link] and my crunch. - [Link] Rhett, you're up. - [Rhett] So you got a good crunch there. - [Link] These are great. These are so great. - [Link] They're not too spicy. - [Jordan] And you really get jalapeno flavor - [Jordan] like a little bit of a fruitiness almost. - [Rhett] So, I think I'm going to go with - [Rhett] what I would do at this point - [Rhett] because that usually is a pretty good guide. - [Rhett] I need a little crunch and I actually think, - [Rhett] oh, God. if we had regular Fritos, - [Rhett] I would choose regular Fritos. - [Rhett] We don't have that. - [Rhett] We have honey barbecue flavored twists, - [Rhett] but we also have Ritz crackers. - [Jordan] Okay. Cause what you want to do - [Jordan] is like a Frito chili pie. - [Jordan] But I didn't give you the right Fritos. - [Rhett] I think that honey barbecue Fritos - [Rhett] are very good, but I feel like - [Rhett] they will send this flavor profile - [Rhett] in a place I don't want to. - [Rhett] And I think that you get kind of - [Rhett] a buttery corn bready kind of thing from Ritz. - [Rhett] And so I'm going with Ritz - [Rhett] for my crunch. - [Link] I am going with - [Rhett] I'm sweating. - [Link] Oh, is this salsa? - [Link] I thought that was guacamole. - [Jordan] It's avocado salsa, - [Jordan] which at Sporked, - [Jordan] we are very happy to tell you - [Jordan] that you should not really - [Jordan] buy store bought guac. - [Jordan] Just buy avocado salsa. - [Jordan] It is what you want guac to be. - [Link] Well, let's bring it in here - [Link] because I'm choosing it and - [Jordan] Okay, this is not that, so. - [Jordan] Egg on my face, - [Jordan] this is just regular guac - [Link] This is my favorite guacamole. - [Link] So this is my pick. - [Jordan] So it's even more customized, like, for you. - [Link] But what you're suggesting here - [Link] is a bigger container. - [Link] That is, is it thinner? - [Jordan] No. So it's not just them. - [Jordan] This is one of the ones we love. - [Jordan] But there's a couple companies that make it. - [Jordan] It's called avocado salsa, instead of guac, - [Jordan] and it is still thick. - [Jordan] It's prominent in avocado. - [Jordan] But a lot of times it'll have - [Jordan] like a little tomatillo in it or something, - [Jordan] some aspects of salsa verde. - [Jordan] So it has so much flavor, - [Jordan] it doesn't have that weird, acidic taste - [Jordan] that a lot of store bought guacamoles have - [Stevie] A lot of taco trucks have avocado salsa. - [Rhett] Yeah. - [Link] El Pollo Loco also. - [Jordan] El Pollo Loco, my favorite taco truck. - [Rhett] That was my first experience - [Rhett] with avocado salsa. - [Rhett] Okay, this is quite a match - [Rhett] because we've got an ingredient - [Rhett] that I don't necessarily know - [Rhett] if someone wants to get stuck with, - [Rhett] dark chocolate. Now, here's the thing. - [Rhett] My wonderful wife, who I lost my virginity to. - [Jordan] Sure. - [Link] That's a construct. - [Rhett] She makes a mean chili - [Rhett] and she puts dark chocolate in her chili. - [Rhett] And it is great, but she puts it in there, - [Rhett] not at this point. - [Rhett] She puts it in there as it's simmering, - [Rhett] whatever, it's part of the recipe. - [Rhett] It's not an add on. - [Rhett] So don't want to get stuck with that. - [Link] Gosh, these are so good in this. - [Rhett] I feel like I've got my crunch. - [Rhett] I don't think you need salsa, - [Rhett] when you've got, - [Rhett] first of all, you've already got chili seasoning - [Rhett] and you've got hot sauce. - [Rhett] I think at this point, - [Rhett] I'm not going to force Link to double cream himself. - [Rhett] I'm going to cream myself - [Rhett] with Greek yogurt. - [Jordan] Two creams, okay. - [Link] That's weird, dude. - [Rhett] No, it's strategy. - [Link] We're all watching. - [Link] All right, so now it's down to this. - [Link] I'm going to get two of these three. - [Link] He's going to take the other one. - [Link] I don't want that dark chocolate. - [Link] That is just going to be strange zone. - [Rhett] Well, you might be stuck with it. - [Jordan] Unfortunately, you will be getting it. - [Jordan] I'll tell you right now. ((Laughing)) - [Jordan] You know, as a friend, - [Jordan] you will be getting that, - [Jordan] so start mentally preparing. - [Link] I need some heat, - [Link] because I know Jordan likes to heat. - [Jordan] I do. I love to heat. - [Link] You love to heat. - [Jordan] I love to heat. - [Link] That would be a great slogan - [Link] for any type of spicy thing. - [Link] For people who love to heat. - [Jordan] Okay. Yeah. - [Jordan] You guys should make a shirt, - [Jordan] and with my face on it - [Jordan] that says that, and sell it. - [Link] I love to heat? - [Jordan] Yeah. - [Rhett] Okay, obviously I'm going - [Rhett] Fritos here, Link's going with chocolate. - [Rhett] And that is the final thing - [Rhett] we should assemble. - [Link] Okay. - [Jordan] Is this how you're giving it to him? - [Jordan] Just the full bar? - [Link] I know, it's like, what do I do? - [Jordan] I thought they would grate it for you - [Jordan] or something. - [Link] So when you're recommending this - [Link] at Sporked, - [Link] you're just recommending it - [Link] as a dark chocolate bar. - [Jordan] As a dark chocolate, but like Rhett said, - [Jordan] a lot of times, chili - [Jordan] or things like mole sauce - [Jordan] can have a little bit of really dark chocolate - [Jordan] in them in the cooking process. - [Jordan] So this was kind of a fun, little different - [Jordan] homage to that. - [Jordan] But yeah, we're not selling this - [Jordan] as like a chocolate chili. - [Link] Yeah, not great. That's not great. - [Jordan] The most interesting thing to me - [Jordan] about the way you always do this - [Jordan] is you always leave some - [Jordan] not mixed together. - [Link] I know. I want to give you an escape hatch. - [Jordan] All right. - [Link] Okay, that's good. - [Link] Very mango-y - [Jordan] It has pineapple in it. - [Link] Mango? - [Jordan] Pineapple. - [Link] Oh, pineapple. Habanero. - [Rhett] What did he say? Mango? - [Jordan] He keeps saying mango. - [Jordan] He's smelling it, but then he also read it, - [Jordan] and still said mango. - [Link] Because the lights are on. - [Link] I can hear you talking about me. - [Link] Okay, look at this. - [Jordan] You're done. You're ready. - [Link] Good God, yours looks like - [Link] middle school vomit. - [Rhett] Yeah, mine is about configuring - [Rhett] the perfect bite. - [Jordan] Make me the bite. - [Link] Oh, yes. - [Rhett] I already got hot sauce mixed into - [Link] I acknowledge that I need to - [Jordan] You have to get everything, yeah. - [Rhett] Cheese, there. - [Jordan] Are you ready? Okay. - [Rhett] I really tried. - [Jordan] That's nice. It's very spicy, which I love. - [Jordan] It's creamy.
