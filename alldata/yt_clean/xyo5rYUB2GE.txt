- Hey guys, Metal Jesus with the Immortal John Hancock. How's it going dude? - Always a pleasure to be back. - Dude, isn't it surprising a proper Super Nintendo - [John] I know, but this because there's a new model. - [Metal Jesus] I know, let's take a look. (upbeat rock music) Alright, well let's get started. So was this the first one that came out? - Yep, the ugly US version Also known as the SNES. - [Metal Jesus] Now, So, it's funny you mentioned, you saw there that I was because I didn't jump in For whatever reason, I think at the time I was using my Commodore - [John] Well yeah, I know and if you're PC gaming, the Super Nintendo. - Yeah, but I got to say I loved collecting for it because there were so Now I would say that the is the output. - Yes. - It can be kind of confusing if you have a modern television, how to get the best video of this, right? - You have some options now, and again, your options are limited to third-party companies that have stock. So, I know that you know ... - So it comes with this. - Yes. - Which basically is the standard they used for quite a - Yep, the composite. - [Metal Jesus] Composite just the yellow and then - [John] Yes, there is that you can get for your console. Now here's the downside, I S-video is not available or being produced on modern television sets. - [Metal Jesus] Right. - [John] There is a company HD Retrovision and they do provide a component cable that works natively without modding your console on the Super Nintendo. - I had no idea, when you told me this I was like what, really? - Yeah, yeah, and I don't but I do have one of the There are some HD TVs, but it's better than nothing. - Oh sure. - And it looks great. - I bet it does. - Yeah. - Okay so that's a first model, - Alright, so this is like the SNES-2, you know it used to be called the Mini. - [Metal Jesus] Some - [John] Yeah. - [Metal Jesus] I've - [John] Yeah, it's just a smaller version and with less components inside. It's a nice looking console actually. It's very sleek and kind of streamlined. [John] Yeah, so the downside is, so the pro is it's smaller. The con is that it doesn't - Oh, okay. - And there is some things, to collect the different versions of it, and there was a bunch so this is just a base model. They had a ton of different pack-in games. Even I want to say, Star Fox and some other games were - Yoshi's Island, and so this model is mostly to on a modern television set. Now, if you're playing on a - It's fine, but it only - Okay. - So ... - And then we have to the Super Nintendo Classic Mini. - [John] That's right, yep. - [Metal Jesus] Which I think that, you know I was excited to see to the NES Classic last year. - [John] Absolutely, you have you know, mini version with save states, and it's with the prototype, Star Fox 2-- - [Metal Jesus] And some I mean if you don't know anything about Super Nintendo and into it, for $80, it is a heck of a deal. - [John] Yeah, because now especially some of the games, $80 by themselves. - [Metal Jesus] Yeah a and of course, being that it supports HDMI and pretty much exactly the so they really are trying to the modern system and keep them intact. Also, we do want to do a There are a bunch of clone systems. - [John] Oh my goodness, yes! - [Metal Jesus] And you and I I have a RetroN 5, and so if your looking to play your real games, there's definitely options. - [John] Yeah, and I think that the different clone consoles, depending on what they are, some look better than others the hardware of these - It varies, so you're dig around in some of the reviews and see because I like the ones that allow you to use a real controller. - Absolutely. - That to me is pretty important, so just be aware that's So speaking of controllers, - [John] The classic. - [Metal Jesus] I love this controller. It's so comfortable even today. - [John] Yeah, and this to me, was one of the first, I would say versions of a modern controller, or anything, but the classic shoulder buttons, forefront I mean controllers have - [Metal Jesus] Yeah, I of the first controllers in my hands, it's rounded, It's kind of taken from the dog bone, a little bit of the NES, right? - Yeah, yeah, and it feels really nice and the other thing about as many know out there, extremely durable. I mean this is a controller extensively, and it'll still - And it's designed for and it will last forever, - Yep, gosh I remember so many memories of getting mad at a game and just-- - Wanting it to break. - Punching the controller, from punching the controller, that's a skateboarding accident. - Oh, okay, your bruised knuckles there. - Yeah, my knuckles like are grated off. - So of course, they - Oh my gosh. - Which is a great arcade stick. - It is, it is great, you know - [Metal Jesus] Fighting turbo options. Is there slow-mo on that as well? There's a bunch of different So, auto fire-- - [John] Auto turbo, and I don't see ... Oh yeah, a slow button This is a great feature if and you want things to slow down. What's kind of cool is have that built in. - That's true, built-in slow down, yes. Okay and then this weapon here, yeah ... - Lethal Enforcers gun, the Justifier, and what's great about this I don't know all the games but I mostly use it for Lethal Enforcers. On a side note, the second into the bottom of this - Yeah, that's interesting huh? But it's worth mentioning want to play likened games and in general, those don't work on modern HD televisions, so just be aware that if of likened games, you're in your house and play to be played, so something - Yeah, and we don't have it front of us, but the Super Scope 6, want to make a gun because at the time, so they made a-- - Well, this looks like a - Yes, this is made by Konami and Nintendo decided, &quot;we're gonna make a bazooka,&quot; you know. - Go big or go home. - That's right. - Too funny, alright well so Do we wanna talk about this? - Yeah, so in my opinion, one accessory for your Super Nintendo and this is not including you gotta get a Super Game Boy and this opens up the library that you can play on your console. This is one of the greatest things. - [Metal Jesus] When this came out, it was ground-breaking, people loved it. - [John] And the other thing to note is this works on many of the including the RetroN 5. - Does it? - Yes. - Oh, I didn't know that. - Yeah and it's awesome, so I love playing using this and a nice So you know especially with the difficulty of finding the Game Boy Advance adapter for the Game Cube, and so and cheaper, even though it doesn't play Game Boy Advanced games, - Alright, cool, and then you - Super Multitap for those and some other four-player games. I don't know exactly There's a lot of four-player but this is well built, you know, Hudson. - Has a little B. - Got a little B, got to play - Oh very cool, so that's but you know it's all about the games, so let's check those out. Alright dude, so many games - It is hard to pick a starting point. There's over 700 games in the so if you don't see your game, it's okay. - Yeah, yeah, but we that we do think everyone should probably have in their collection. - Yes, and one of the first I recommend is Donkey Kong Country. - [Metal Jesus] Dude, this - [John] Oh yeah. - [Metal Jesus] I mean, I I remember being a PC gamer, and seeing this game running on a monitor and I was shocked how beautiful it was. It was ground breaking at the time. - [John] Yeah, I mean, when how were they able to make that And you know, this is at the the Super Nintendo's life, gorgeous game-- - [Metal Jesus] Beautiful. - [John] Fun, two-player. - [Metal Jesus] Great music, it's still fun to play even today, the footage and I could've kept going. - Yeah, it's a really good game and a timeless classic, excellent. - Okay cool, Super Metroid-- - [John] Oh my gosh. - [Metal Jesus] Dude, I'm actually not that big of on the NES, it's a great it's just that it's not this. They nailed it out of the This is the reason why people It's because so much of it started here. - [John] I think this is a as the Super Nintendo did than the original Nintendo. - [Metal Jesus] Good point. - [John] Super Nintendo Better graphics, better more diversity, it's just I think people that are Super Metroid is the gold - [Metal Jesus] Oh yeah, to get a complete copy to my collection. This is one of those (imitates opera singing) you know, so yes, please pick it up. - Next one, one of the best 2D fighters. - I hear about this all the time. - [John] Street Fighter II Turbo. I mean it is essentially the fighting game to get on Super Nintendo. It's the best version and it was really one of Wow, these home consoles of an arcade game, and this where 2D fighting was huge, and they just knocked it out of the park. This is so well done, this of the old home versions that they did, especially the 16-bit era, - [Metal Jesus] Right ... Alright, another classic, if we did not mention this game, and that is The Legend of What do you say about this game other than it's an absolute I mean for so many people, For a lot of people, it certainly, their favorite Zelda game. - [John] Took the original enhanced it, excellent story, sound. It really, you know, I think back looking at early magazines, there was Zelda 3 or whatever, and it was to me, I played that, and I didn't play I just sat down and that to me is like Nintendo at its peak point, perfection, just so many classic memories, and for a lot of people that's - [Metal Jesus] I remember my and this is the only game We still played it a ton, it was so cool. So you're gonna want to pick it up. - Next one is my pick on the console. - This was fun watching and capturing footage. - Yes, Super Ghouls 'N action platform-style games I try to play this around I get in the mood and it's wonderful. It does have a little bit of slow down, but the graphics and sound are amazing. The other cool thing, it is included into one of the games on the SNES Classic Mini, which I'm really excited about. Again, this really is an example of how well and excellent the graphics - [Metal Jesus] Alight, two games here and those these are RPGS. Basically, we have Final Fantasy III, this is also known as Final Fantasy VI. It's technically the and we got it as III, So Final Fantasy III, I got obsessed with it when it came out because what that this was happening at were kind of like Lord of this is not, this is like a futuristic, cyber, steampunky thing and it's just beautiful, epic, it's amazing. - [John] And many hours. - [Metal Jesus] And many this is definitely one of my and then we have Chrono Trigger, which was a game I actually didn't play until I actually played it on And again, got sucked into it. Chrono Trigger is a classic for a reason because it has an epic story It has one of my favorite It still holds up today, and absolute joy, both - [John] Absolutely ... Next up, now, over a third so we definitely have to Now there's some other but you know with our one sports game, NBA - [Metal Jesus] People They love it. - [John] Yeah, it's just It's basketball, people understand the concept of basketball, you can play a game, you It has so many great little features like hidden codes and stuff-- - Is this the one where There's one of them. - Yes, yes, though I don't but yeah, there's some hidden - Okay, okay. - I think so, but again, play this game. - I've heard that this is a game for, I'm not a sports fan, but one of those games that can pick up and play and have fun with. - Yeah, so an interesting side story is one of the early we did a tournament on this - Really? - Yeah and so it was just kind plays like an arcade game. - Okay, so we wanted to You and I went back and forth. Originally we were gonna choose Mario Kart and we're like &quot;does it really hold up?&quot; I don't know ... - And then, we're like well we can do F-0, which does hold up, but then So I thought we should - [John] Wow. - [Metal Jesus] Actually the you wanted to do Rock 'n Roll Racing, which is a great suggestion. This is just like that, but even weirder. So basically it's an very much like Rock 'n Roll Racing, very much like R.C. Pro-Am Super fun to play, great graphics, controls really well, you know You can debate, but I so I wanted to include it. - [John] And correct me if I'm - [Metal Jesus] I believe so. I never watched it, I don't know. So I just know that when into Rock 'n Roll Racing, someone's like, &quot;Oh, you've gotta check - Alright, cool, I'll Alright, this next one is another oddity and it's part action platform, and it's ActRaiser and there's one of two. I think the first one's better and ActRaiser's a must play, and it really isn't a game, that comes along and there's not a single other game just like it. - [Metal Jesus] Cool. - [John] It's a combination style of games, which were really popular and I appreciate it, and it's console exclusive. - [Metal Jesus] Okay. - [John] Check it out. Turtles in Time, Turtles in Time, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 4. Now this was a great series on Nintendo. There was an awesome version I think the Super and graphics, game play, arcade, classic-style brawler. - [Metal Jesus] You love your brawlers. - [John] Oh my gosh, yes, and you know, technically we have weapons, and I highly recommend I usually pick Leonardo - [Metal Jesus] Now is that included on the Super Nintendo Mini? - [John] No. - [Metal Jesus] Oh, okay, gonna wanna pick up the physical version of it then. - [John] My box is totally beat up. I've had this in my - [Metal Jesus] Really? - [John] Yeah, it was like a freebie at one of the early and it was just in a free pile because it was all tattered up and so I said, &quot;I'll take it.&quot; - [Metal Jesus] Mine. - [John] I'll take it, yeah. - [Metal Jesus] And then I don't know. - Yeah, I don't know. - Everyone's sick of hearing about Mario. No, of course, we picked two of them here. Super Mario All Stars. - [John] Yeah, so Super Mario All Stars is a must play and to me, if you play it on the Super Nintendo, you're the classics on the Nintendo anymore. Better graphics, better There's again, it has lost levels, which was the Japanese version and it really to me, is the best way to play Super Mario Brothers classic games. - [Metal Jesus] Oh, it - [John] Yeah, oh yeah. - [Metal Jesus] Oh, I love that game. - [John] Oh yeah, I mean that's amazing. And so to me, and again, that's not on the SNES Classic Mini, and so, definitely There's also a variation Super Mario World, which again, is the game that was made ground And so this is essentially-- - [John] Super Mario This is the pack-in, the original release for Super Nintendo. - [Metal Jesus] Is that the one where it has the overall map? - [John] Yes, and kind of but yeah, it's everything, I mean to me, that is a better package 'cause there's so many but this is pretty classic. I mean it's larger, it's a larger game, pick it up, it's amazing. - [Metal Jesus] See I need This is what this is telling - [John] Yeah, I'm gonna go - [Metal Jesus] I know, And I wanna jump back into Chrono Trigger 'cause now that I think about it, man that was such a good I was playing on my PSP, Alright dude, so obviously and on and on and on, and there's so many great games for the system. That's what's so fun is that I mean there's - What games would you Put them in the comments below. - Yeah, I know I would love to know, because is your collection - Yes, I've been missing but cart only, I have of the Super Nintendo.
