[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] &gt;&gt; Jennifer: SO, ARE YOU EXCITED? &gt;&gt; I'M EXCITED. &gt;&gt; BUCKLE DOWN AND GET COMFORTABLE. MY FIRST QUESTION, DO YOU THINK IT'S A COINCIDENCE THAT REGGIE BUSH'S WIFE LOOKS JUST LIKE YOU? I DON'T. [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] &gt;&gt; THIS IS GOING TO BE FUN. &gt;&gt; Jennifer: SO I'VE BEEN OBSESSED WITH YOU -- PROBABLY NOT FOR YOU. I'VE BEEN OBSESSED WITH YOU FOR A REALLY LONG TIME. CAN YOU REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME WE MET? &gt;&gt; I DO, ACTUALLY. WE WERE AT -- &gt;&gt; Jennifer: OH MY GOD. &gt;&gt; WE WERE AT A HOTEL IN NEW YORK. AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE WE WERE COMING FROM, BUT IT WAS LATE. WE WERE GOING UP TO SEE THIS AXL GEVORT SUITE AT THE GREENWICH. I'M GETTING IN THE ELEVATOR WITH KANYE, THE DOOR'S ABOUT TO CLOSE, I HEAR JENNIFER SCREAMING &quot;I LOVE YOUR SHOW.&quot; ACROSS THE LOBBY. &gt;&gt; Jennifer: THAT WAS THE SAME HOTEL WHERE I WAS TAKING OFF MY BRA UNDER MY SHIRT AND KANYE TAPPED ME ON THE SHOULDER. I WAS LIKE, WHAT? OH MY GOD! SO RECENTLY I WENT OVER TO YOUR MOM'S HOUSE FOR DINNER. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; Jennifer: IT WAS EVER I COULD HAVE EVER CRDREAMED OF. &gt;&gt; WAS IT? &gt;&gt; Jennifer: YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE I HAVE TO SAY, SO JENNIFER CAME OVER FOR DINNER LIKE TWO WEEKS AGO. &gt;&gt; Jennifer: YEAH. &gt;&gt; I'VE NEVER SEEN MY MOM MORE DRUNK IN OUR LIVES. &gt;&gt; Jennifer: I WAS WAY MORE DRUNK THAN YOUR MOM. YOU TAKE IT EASY ON YOUR MOTHER. &gt;&gt; NOT POSSIBLE. IT WAS -- IT WAS SO FUNNY. I'VE NEVER SEEN THIS! &gt;&gt; Jennifer: NO. DON'T EVEN REMEMBER. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] &gt;&gt; AT THAT POINT IT WAS LIKE TWO -- THEY HAD LIKE A FEW TOO MANY DRINKS FOR MY TASTE. &gt;&gt; Jennifer: YEAH. WELL, YOU WERE DRINKING TEA. [ LAUGHTER ] SO I UNDERSTAND. AND I REMEMBER GETTING NAKED IN YOUR MOM'S CLOSET AND ORDERING YOU TO DRESS ME. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; Jennifer: YOU DRESSED ME FABULOUSLY. I LOOKED AMAZING AS YOU COULD SEE IN THAT VIDEO. IS MY MEMORY CORRECT, DID YOU CALL KANYE TO COME UP IN THE CLOSET? DID YOU WANT HIM TO STYLE ME? &gt;&gt; YOU SAID, I'M NOT JOKING, &quot;I REALLY WANT KANYE TO STYLE ME.&quot; SO I SAID OKAY, AND I COME BACK IN AND YOU'RE FULLY BUCK NAKED. I GET ON THE INTERCOM AND TELL HIM TO NOT COME UPSTAIRS. AND WE PUT ON ONE OF MY MOM'S DRESSES AND YOU WORE IT THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE DINNER. &gt;&gt; Jennifer: OH, I HAVE IT. I WENT HOME IN IT. [ LAUGHTER ] DO YOU AND KANYE LIKE FART IN FRONT OF EACH OTHER OR TALK ABOUT FARTS? [ LAUGHTER ] DO YOU FART IN FRONT OF HIM? &gt;&gt; I DON'T FART, WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] &gt;&gt; Jennifer: THERE'S NO REAL GOOD WAY TO SEGUE INTO THAT. I WAS JUST THINKING, BECAUSE I ASKED YOU TO GET ME GAS-X, I REMEMBER KANYE LOOKING DOWN THE TABLE LIKE, OH MY GOD, SHE FARTS! I HAD ONE OF THOSE STABBING GAS PAINS IN THE BACK OF MY RIBS. &gt;&gt; YOU DID. &gt;&gt; Jennifer: BECAUSE I WAS SO EXCITED. [ LAUGHTER ] &gt;&gt; I FEEL LIKE I KNOW YOU SO WELL NOW. &gt;&gt; Jennifer: YEAH, INSIDE AND OUT. [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH. SO ONE THING THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE MIGHT NOT KNOW IF THEY HAVEN'T WATCHED EVERY SINGLE EPISODE FROM THE TIME THE SHOW STARTED IS THAT YOU RUN INSTAGRAM AND SOCIAL MEDIA, BUT YOU'RE ALSO A BONA FIDE HACKER. &gt;&gt; TOTALLY. I'M RETIRED. I'M FULLY RETIRED. &gt;&gt; Jennifer: TELL ME ABOUT THOSE DAYS. &gt;&gt; YEAH, I USED TO BE LIKE THE GO-TO SPY THAT EVERYONE WOULD CALL AND TRY TO GET INFO ON THEIR BOYFRIENDS OR HUSBANDS OR WHATEVER. &gt;&gt; Jennifer: HOW DID YOU GET IT?

THERE IS THIS SERVICE THAT I FIGURED OUT THAT YOU CAN CALL SOMEONE'S NUMBER AND MAKE IT LOOK LIKE IT'S ANYONE ELSE'S NUMBER CALLING THEM. SO WHAT I FIGURED OUT IS HOW TO GET INTO THE VOICE MAIL SYSTEM IS IF YOU CALL THE NUMBER, BUT MAKE IT LOOK LIKE IT'S YOUR OWN NUMBER CALLING. IT TRICKS THE SYSTEM AND GETS RIGHT INTO THE VOICE MAIL SYSTEM. WE'RE SCREWED NOW THAT THERE'S TEXTING. BECAUSE NO ONE LEAVES VOICE MAILS ANYMORE. &gt;&gt; Jennifer: RIGHT, YEAH. &gt;&gt; BUT I GOT ALL THE DIRT BACK IN THE DAY. &gt;&gt; Jennifer: TOTAL CREEPS ARE SCREWED. &gt;&gt; I GOT MAJOR DIRT BACK IN THE DAY. &gt;&gt; Jennifer: WOW.
