Surrounded by his bodyguards it is for us that he is there that day. - In this kind of situation, it's already happened that we make each other when we arrive on their plantation. This morning, the soldiers spotted a in vegetation like this, as big as half The traffickers had to - We are here and I can They must be up there They don't miss a beat Under guard, The general himself - It's important to do this. Several fields will be uprooted For the general take us here - Everyone must that the armed forces implement the orders by the Minister of Defense Destructions and seizures. But also a demonstration of force, intended to regain control of cities, sometimes completely fallen The army organizes and excavations The goal ? Cutting the roads of the d**** - This road is a strategic access. If you continue straight, this is where you need to go weapons and money. That day they will find nothing Back to base. In a corner of the garrison, 10 tons of m*****, but also dozens seized by the military And also the fleet of 850 vehicles, confiscated from narcos in 3 years of war Among his collection of seizures, the general shows us - This hiding place was for the money, - There, behind, you can store weapons This vehicle is armored.

Most of these weapons - Finally, you have a double - It's true, on the way out, we have to And on the way back, they are weapons and that we must seek. This is one of the causes In the warehouse, thousands of weapons D****, weapons and manhunt. The thousands of soldiers, commandos have orders to capture dead Each operation, like this, In 4 years, several dozen killers and See extradited to the United States, which partly finance The Michoacan region cartel, was thus almost dismantled For the Mexican government a war that scores points. Except that the end of each godfather - As long as there is a demand for or any other d****, There will always be So when you cut off a head, What the Mexican government it's trying to break to bring back d**** traffic In the meantime, the war spreads between A cartel, that of Sinaloa, is in progress in an extremely deadly manner. Its leader, Joaquin Guzman Loera, even had the honors classified among men 10 years ago, however, Guzman languished for long when he mysteriously ran away El Chapo's head is today, price $5 million In Mexico, a journalist lives under protection She states that if the Sinaloa cartel it would be thanks to the help of complicity Anabel Hernandez She obtained the minutes depositions of former police officers and confidential reports Annabel says governments have been involved since with drug cartels. - Previously, the federal government had Everyone had their territory. They never encroached Everyone worked in their own corner without A real pact between the cartels But in 2000, it was a change of direction. Vicente Fox is elected president of Mexico. He belongs to the party the same as that of the president To get their piece of the pie, the men of the new ruling party the Sinaloa cartel - What has changed ? It is that from his inauguration, President Fox decided to end To choose just one, And it is thanks to this protection, that the Sinaloa cartel was able It's not a war but a war between the cartels in which the government participates by helping According to Anabel Hernandez, part would be at the heart We returned to question We find them in Culiacan, the stronghold of Chapo Guzman.

Some say others saw it in Honduras. There are even some who have seen it in Europe. With all the means he has, But of course if one day, we have the clues to go back Return to the base, the headquarters from where in the region and who directs - There are some who claim that the party - You know, this kind of analysis, We are only performers. You have to ask the question Me, what I know, It's to arrest delinquents whatever the group I am not interested in any trafficker, I have orders to search and eradicate The fact is that the Chapo Guzman cartel The war has just broken out Mass graves of sex trafficking like this one we filmed Forensic Identification Police victims of summary executions. In Mexico, they are called mass graves in which shot in the back of the head, strangled, This grave is the second mass grave not far from the village of Palomas. 5 corpses in one... 20 in the other. However, before the war, Palomas was a charming little town Nestled on the border with his Mariachi Today, medical tourism is over, which attracted hundreds of visitors The mayor, who refused the gang law, ended up charred in his car As is often the case, the Church has become the priest Padre Antonio tries to - In this moment of despair, We are overwhelmed. All that remains is to ask - And are among your parishioners - To my knowledge, no. - The problem is that we, the people It's the bad guys who are armed. At mass time this Sunday, the small community is still under - Today we will pray for rest Mass graves, but also and terrified residents. On the square, in front of the church, the kiosk has become the preferred place Like this body placed there at dawn, a few days after our visit, with a word of warning In the village, everyone but omerta is a question - Here, if you are going something, You have no right to say anything. - What he means is They are capable of taking on They come, they take you away Who are they ?

But I know he was Lorenzo lived in this room, Since the first day of his disappearance, What role did the army play? - My son called me. He said to me: &quot;Mom, I'm coming The next day, I went I said to the policeman: "Excuse me, When my son called me yesterday, Do you know ?&quot; And there, the policeman I tried to calm him down, to tell him that that I had just come to see if my son He yelled at me again. - I tell you that your son was not kidnapped. "Kidnapped." At no moment, And I understood that he had seen Some people think that these mass graves did not to hide their settling of scores, but are the work of soldiers The Coral family Because Guadalupe, she too was in the streets of Palomas. A quest that led her to the army. - At the entrance to Palomas, Those with a sand-colored trellis. They laughed at the beginning and after And all the time I know a lady there, and her daughters told me she had and everyone in the village, said it was the soldiers who had kidnapped my husband and the others. Refugee in the United States 60 kilometers away journalist Emilio Gutierrez goes further He fled Mexico two years ago, - In several articles, extortion, illegal searches, in which they soaked And one evening, one of my friends who was going out heard them say And she warned me. - But the army is there - I would rather say that the army the most powerful, She's the one who does the dirty work. You saw these mass graves The two mass graves were located Complicit soldiers. An accusation that comes up more and more Return to Mexico, to Palomas. All around the city, As night fell, the soldiers in position near the border post. A presence that does not prevent The last latecomers hurry Palomas turns into a ghost town. The mariachis are idle. Only two die-hard Americans In a bar on a hidden camera, a resident - It seems there are two cartels here. - One of the cartels is Juarez He wants to conquer this city. That's why - And the military? - They play an important role. We are not sure You know what I mean ? We don't know who they work for. What we know is that the feds and that the local police, works for the other cartel. Chapo Guzman, the head of the Sinaloa cartel, would be conquering Palomas And it says here that it is Two streets further, -And you think the army is involved? - Actually yes... - Yes or no ? - There were these two Deming guys.

The cartels? Do you want to meet the cartels? - I would like an explanation. - I doubt that. The army, the last bastion of Mexico, We tried to meet the general at the time of the mass graves. We have been told shortly after Like in 90% of murder cases. no investigation has allowed to date, to find out who had filled In 4 years, hundreds of thousands towards the south of Mexico, They would be 200,000 nothing The American government begins Jorge Luis Aguirre is also a journalist.

When you start impunity and lack of justice, Jorge asked us not to locate He continues his investigations He does it remotely thanks whom he calls daily. - I can't stop now. My work, We have no alternative. This is also my way of contributing so that maybe one day things will change. According to the UN, Mexico is now for journalists, 40,000 deaths in 4 years, Massacres that increase in intensity However, in Mexico, the spokesperson believes that the antid**** operation - It's wrong !

Aggressive ? - Yes, he's locked there. Here we have secure cells We lock them up when when the medications So, have you calmed down? In the cage, the minimum wage workers. Dealers, maybe even killers. - The smallest cartels can no longer So they sell it here. They started selling it Not in money, in doses of d****. It created a brutal general addiction. - And what are they paid to do? To distribute d**** What were you taking? - And what else ? - What now ? -And what were you taking? - Anything that rocks! - You were part of a mafia. - And what were you doing in there? We were selling shit, all that, - They are what we call no one controls anything anymore They are the ones... Like Pastor Galvan's asylum, For the investigative journalist there is an urgent need to tackle - If the federal government of Mexico to the corruption that fuels so, all of us, we will live like in Ciudad Juarez.
