I STILL NEED AN OYSTER TOWER AND A GARLIC-CRUSTED RACK OF LAMB. LET'S KEEP THESE ORDERS MOVING. I AM STILL WAITING ON MY ROASTED MONKFISH FOR TABLE 14. I GOT A COUPLE CELEBRATING THEIR ANNIVERSARY HERE AND LET'S NOT RUIN IT WITH NO FOOD, WHICH MEANS NO TIP FOR YOUR GIRL. [ SIGHS HEAVILY ] OH, APRIL, LET ME SEE THAT PLATE. ONE-HORSE OPEN SLEIGH HMM, THANKS FOR LOOKING OUT, CHEF. EVERY DISH MUST BE PERFECT, PEOPLE. IT'S ABOUT ATTENTION TO DETAIL, THINNER SLICES. GUESTS MAY NOT REMEMBER EVERY GREAT MEAL THEY HAVE, BUT THEY WILL REMEMBER THE BAD ONES AND THEY WILL TELL THEIR FRIENDS. REALLY? IS THAT WHY I'M LOSING MONEY? WHAT IS IT, MARK? I'M BUSY. THOUGHT WE WERE GOING WITH SMALLER FISH PORTIONS. AND WAS THAT A PREMIUM GARNISH ON THAT DISH? THIS IS A FINE DINING RESTAURANT NOT A FAST FOOD JOINT. AND YOU HIRED ME TO RUN THE KITCHEN, SO I'D APPRECIATE IT IF YOU WOULD LET ME DO THAT. EXCUSE ME. HEY, GOOD WORK TONIGHT. CHLOE? YES, MARK? I'M LETTING YOU GO, CHLOE. WHAT? I'M LETTING YOU GO. YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS. CHRISTMAS IS A FEW WEEKS AWAY, WE'RE JUST GEARING UP FOR THE HOLIDAY RUSH. HOLIDAY RUSH? THERE IS NO HOLIDAY RUSH. OUR HOLIDAY RESERVATIONS ARE WAY DOWN. YOUR DISHES ARE TOO EXPENSIVE AND THE MARGINS ARE TOO LOW FOR OUR INVESTOR GROUP. YOU HIRED ME TO TURN THIS RESTAURANT AROUND. TWO YEARS AGO, I WAS LISTED TOP FIVE IN ATLANTA CHRONICLE'S RANKING FOR BEST CHEFS IN THE CITY. OH, WELL, I GUESS YOU'VE LOST YOUR TOUCH THEN. [ MOUTHS WORD ] THE LATEST RESTAURANT REVIEW FROM FOOD CRITIC SHERRI WATKINS JUST CAME OUT AND IT'S TERRIBLE. SHE SAYS YOUR MENU TRIES TOO HARD TO IMPRESS WITH ELABORATE PRESENTATIONS INSTEAD OF CREATING FOOD PEOPLE ACTUALLY WANT TO EAT. WELL, MAYBE IF YOU'D STOP CHANGING MY MENU AND PRICE GOUGING OUR CUSTOMERS, WE'D BE DOING BETTER. I DON'T GIVE A DAMN ABOUT FOOD, I GIVE A DAMN ABOUT MAKING MONEY AND YOUR FOOD'S NOT DOING THAT FOR ME. MARK, YOU TOLD ME AFTER I TURNED THIS PLACE AROUND, YOU'D BACK ME OPENING UP MY OWN PLACE. THAT'S SO NOT HAPPENING. WE'RE GOING IN A NEW DIRECTION AND THAT STARTS WITH A NEW HEAD CHEF. SORRY. [ CELLPHONE VIBRATES ] OH, HEY, APRIL. GIRL, I MEAN, CHEF, I'VE BEEN CALLING YOU FOR TWO DAYS. MARK DID YOU DIRTY FOR REAL. MM, HEY, NO NEED TO CALL ME CHEF. LETTING YOU GO RIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS. THAT'S JUST STRAIGHT FOUL. MARK PAID OUT MY CONTRACT TILL THE END OF THE MONTH. SO FOR NOW, MY FOCUS IS ON FIGURING OUT WHAT'S NEXT FOR MY CAREER AND MY COINS. WITHIN THE LAST 48 HOURS, I'VE CALLED EVERY SINGLE FINE DINING RESTAURANT IN ATLANTA AND I CAN'T EVEN GET A CALL BACK THANKS TO THAT REVIEW. THAT'S WHY I'M CALLING YOU. MY BOYFRIEND'S COUSIN IS LOOKING FOR RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PERSONAL CHEFS FOR HIS BOSS. HE WORKS FOR A PROFESSIONAL BASEBALL PLAYER NAMED DONOVON JACKSON. WAIT, THE PITCHER FOR ATLANTA? YES, GIRL, AND HE IS FINE. HE LIVES IN SAVANNAH WITH HIS FAMILY. OH, GROWING UP, I USED TO SPEND MY SUMMERS IN SAVANNAH WITH MY GRANDMA LEARNING HOW TO COOK. HE HAS THREE KIDS AND THEY'RE LOOKING FOR A LIVE-IN CHEF JUST TO GET THEM THROUGH CHRISTMAS. HMM, I DON'T KNOW, APRIL, ME? [ SCOFFS ] PERSONAL CHEF? IF EVERYTHING WORKS OUT, IT COULD EXTEND THROUGH THE HOLIDAYS! LOOK, DO IT FOR A YEAR, SAVE YOUR MONEY, AND OPEN YOUR OWN RESTAURANT. THROUGH MY LAST JOB WAS SUPPOSED TO LEAD ME OPENING UP MY OWN RESTAURANT. [ SIGHS HEAVILY ] I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT. I CAN WORK FOR THIS FAMILY, SAVE, AND THEN -- THEN OPEN UP MY OWN PLACE. THAT AND I HAVE NO OTHER OPTIONS RIGHT NOW. I'LL TEXT YOU THE GUY'S NUMBER SO YOU COULD SET UP THAT INTERVIEW. THANKS, APRIL. YOU KNOW, USING THE RESTAURANT MENU COUPLED WITH MY GRANDMA'S CHRISTMAS DESSERT RECIPES, I'M GONNA HAVE THIS FAMILY EATING OUT OF MY HAND IN NO TIME. I'LL CALL YOU LATER. ALL RIGHT, GIRL, I KNOW YOU'LL KILL IT. BYE. [ WHISTLE BLOWS ] RISE AND SHINE! GOOD MORNING, D.J., LINDSEY. -MORNING, DAD. -MORNING, DAD. WHERE'S YOUR SISTER?

WELL, YOU'VE BEEN WORKING OUT HARDER THAN USUAL AND NOW YOU'VE GOT A PROBLEM WITH YOUR SHOULDER. SHOULD TALK TO THE TEAM DOC. BUCK, RELAX. ALL RIGHT, I'M JUST SHAKING OFF THE RUST. STAYING LOOSE. WHY CAN'T WE SKIP WORKOUTS AND PUT UP CHRISTMAS DECORATIONS? THE NEIGHBOR'S YARDS AND HOUSES ARE DECORATED ALREADY. YOU KNOW, DAD DOESN'T GET INTO CHRISTMAS SINCE... ANYWAYS, I CAN'T WAIT FOR NANA DEE TO GET HERE SO THE HOUSE CAN FEEL LIKE CHRISTMAS. AND WHEN IS NANA DEE HITCHING UP HER BROOM AND FLYING DOWN TO SAVANNAH? [ LAUGHTER ] SHE BRING HER FLYING MONKEYS? BUCK. YOU KNOW, CHRISTMAS WOULD NOT BE THE SAME WITHOUT MY MOM. CAN'T BELIEVE THE TWO OF YOU CAN'T GET ALONG AFTER ALL THESE YEARS. OH, WELL, YOU NEED TO GET MOVING SO THESE KIDS CAN GET TO SCHOOL ON TIME. ALL RIGHT, JUST DO ME A FAVOR. MAKE SURE YOU RUN THROUGH THOSE PITCHING DRILLS WITH D.J. LATER. -I GOT IT. BUT, DAD, I'VE GOT CHOIR PRACTICE FOR THE CHURCH CHRISTMAS CONCERT. D.J., GOOD OR GREAT? GREAT, GREAT, SIR, I WANT TO BE GREAT. I KNOW YOU DO, SON. ALL RIGHT, TROOPS, LET'S GO. [ WHISTLE BLOWS ] LET'S GO! PUT THE PHONE DOWN, VANESSA. GO! KNEES UP! NO VENDING MACHINES. -BYE, DAD. -NO CAFETERIA MEALS. -BYE, DAD. NO SHARING OTHER PEOPLE'S LUNCHES. BYE, DAD. AND THE CHEF BUCK HIRED WILL BE HERE WHEN YOU GET HOME. YOU'RE WELCOME! [ RECORD NEEDLE SCRATCHES ] [ GASPS ] WELCOME TO SAVANNAH, CHLOE. I'M BUCK AND THAT'S DONOVON JACKSON. HI, IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU, BUCK. [ LAUGHS ] I'M DONOVON'S PITCHING COACH AND I LIVE IN THE GUEST HOUSE, SO I'LL BE AROUND TO HELP YOU WITH THE KIDS DONOVON'S DEMANDS AND HIS MOTHER. WAIT, DONOVON'S DEMANDS? HIS MOTHER? YOU SEE, DONOVON'S PARTICULAR ABOUT HIS DIET AND HIS MOTHER, DOLORES? SHE'S PARTICULAR ABOUT EVERYTHING. BUT DON'T YOU WORRY, CHEF CHLOE, I GOT YOU. HUH, NICE KITCHEN. YEAH. BUT IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT GETS MUCH USE. OH, THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE HERE FOR. YOU DIDN'T TELL ME ABOUT DONOVON'S SPECIAL DIET DURING THE INTERVIEW. WELL, YOU KNOW, HE'S VERY PARTICULAR ABOUT HIS DIET WHEN HE'S PREPARING FOR TRAINING CAMP. HE'D GIVE YOU A MENU TO FOLLOW. YOU DO REALIZE I'M A FINE DINING CHEF. I DO AND I ALSO KNOW THAT YOU STARTED YOUR CAREER BY FIXING COMFORT FOOD. AH, I SEE YOU'VE DONE YOUR RESEARCH. WELL, YOU KNOW, DONOVON AND HIS KIDS, THEY'RE FOLLOWING A STRICT DIET. I MEAN, THIS FAMILY HAVEN'T ENJOYED A MEAL TOGETHER SINCE HIS WIFE OLIVIA DIED. BUT, YOU KNOW, MEALS, THEY USED TO BE A FUN TIME, A WAY TO CONNECT. AND THAT'S WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO. I WANT YOU TO BRING THAT JOY BACK INTO THIS HOME. BY HIRING YOU, YOU ARE MY CHRISTMAS GIFT TO THE FAMILY. AND I'M SURE THAT YOU CAN COME UP WITH SOME DISHES HEALTHY ENOUGH FOR DONOVON. OKAY. HEY, WHERE'S MY MANNERS? WOULD YOU LIKE SOME ICED TEA? ONLY IF IT'S SWEET TEA. OH, WHAT ELSE IS THERE IN SAVANNAH? [ LAUGHS ] OH, THAT BETTER BE SUGAR-FREE. YOU KNOW I DON'T PUT ANY SUGAR IN THIS BODY AND NEITHER SHOULD YOU. HOW YOU DOING? I'M DONOVON. HI, I AM CHLOE McADAMS, YOUR NEW CHEF. IT'S A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU. WE SHOULD PROBABLY REVIEW THE JACKSON FAMILY DIET. ACTUALLY, I'M WORKING ON SOME MENUS. OH, THAT'S NOT NECESSARY. JUST COME WITH ME. [ DRUM BEAT PLAYING ] SO THESE INSTRUCTIONS SHOULD GUIDE YOU THROUGH EACH MEAL YOU SHOULD MAKE. ACTUALLY, I'VE ALREADY PREPARED RECIPES. OH, I'VE OUTLINED EVERYTHING, AND I EXPECT YOU TO FOLLOW IT TO THE LETTER. [ CLEARS THROAT ] YEAH, THERE SEEM TO BE A MISTAKE ON BOARD. I'M SEEING THE LACK OF DESSERTS, AS WELL AS THE ABSENCE OF THE WORD... WHAT AM I LOOKING FOR? DONUTS. WHILE THERE WILL BE NO DONUTS, I WILL ALLOW FOR DESSERTS TO BE PROVIDED ON CERTAIN TIME, CERTAIN DAYS FOLLOWING THE STRICT NO SUGAR GUIDELINES OUTLINED IN THESE BOOKS. FAMILIES SHOULD ENJOY EATING DINNER TOGETHER AND NOT FEEL LIKE THEY'RE EATING OUT OF A PRISON CHOW LINE. WITHIN THIS PLAN THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME ROOM FOR CREATIVITY. NO, YOU NEED TO COOK MEALS EXACTLY AS I'VE INSTRUCTED YOU. WELL, I BROUGHT GROCERIES FROM ATLANTA FOR TONIGHT'S MEAL AND TOMORROW'S BREAKFAST, SO I THINK YOU SHOULD GIVE MY FOOD A SHOT. -WELL, I THINK YOU -- -UH, DONOVON. NOW I HIRED CHLOE BECAUSE OF OUR EXPERTISE IN COOKING COMFORT FOOD. I'M SURE SHE'LL GET UP TO SPEED WITH WHAT I WANT. SO LET'S REVIEW THE LIST OF NO'S, SHALL WE? NO BREAD OR PASTA WITH GLUTEN. NO BREAKFAST CEREALS, NO DAIRY, NO SOY, NO CORN, NO HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SIRUP, NO FOODS MADE WITH GMOs. ARE YOU GETTING ALL THIS? NO TRANS FATS, MOST COOKING OILS, NO COOKIES THAT BEGIN WITH THE LETTER C, NO SALTY SNACKS, NO SWEETENED DRINKS LIKE SWEET TEA. SO CHEF CHLOE, WHAT'S FOR DINNER? I'LL FIGURE IT OUT. OH, DON'T FORGET YOUR BOOKS. SUGAR COOKIES? MY FAVORITE. WHO ARE YOU? I'M CHEF CHLOE McADAMS. BUCK HIRED ME TO COOK FOR YOUR FAMILY FOR THE HOLIDAY SEASON, HERE, TRY ONE. KEEP MAKING COOKIES AND CAKE AND YOU'LL BE THE NEXT CHEF DAD FIRES. OH, WELL, ACTUALLY, THESE ARE SUGAR-FREE SUGAR COOKIES, BUT AS FOR THAT CAKE, I'M STILL WORKING ON MODIFYING MY GRANDMA'S CHRISTMAS DESSERT RECIPE. SUGAR-FREE? I CAN'T TELL. SO YOU'RE HERE UNTIL CHRISTMAS? WE'LL SEE. I VOTE CHEF CHLOE STAYS. D.J.! YOUR DAD'S WAITING FOR YOU OUT BACK. DANG, UNCLE BUCK, CAN'T I CATCH A BREAK? WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR DAD SAYS. Both: TAKING BREAKS IS NOT HOW YOU GET TO THE PROS. YOU KNOW IT. LET'S GO. OFFICIAL TASTER. [ LAUGHS ] SO WHERE YOU FROM, CHEF CHLOE? I LIVE IN ATLANTA, BUT GROWING UP, I SPENT SUMMERS HERE AND THEN I WENT TO SAVANNAH STATE AND THEN AFTER THAT I WENT TO MANHATTAN CULINARY COLLEGE. AND SINCE THEN, I'VE WORKED IN SOME OF THE FINEST RESTAURANTS IN NEW YORK AND -- -IS THIS YOU? -OH, HI. YOU MUST NOT BE A VERY GOOD CHEF. WELL, WHY DON'T YOU SEE WHAT YOU THINK AFTER DINNER TONIGHT, HUH? HEY, NANA DEE, WHEN ARE YOU COMING FOR CHRISTMAS? WE'VE GOT ANOTHER NEW COOK AND SHE MIGHT BE WORSE THAN THE LAST ONE DAD FIRED. [ LAUGHS ] DON'T MIND VANESSA. SHE'S EXTRA MEAN AROUND CHRISTMAS BECAUSE SHE MISSES OUR MOM. SORRY ABOUT YOUR MOM, LINDSEY. THANKS, WE ALL REALLY MISS HER. DID YOU KNOW BAKING SODA REACTS WITH ACIDS IN THE DOUGH TO MAKE CARBON DIOXIDE? WHICH HELPS THE CAKES TO RISE IN THE OVEN? WOW, SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE AN EXPERT IN THE SCIENCE LAB AND THE KITCHEN. YOU THINK YOU'LL GIVE MY FOOD A SHOT? AS LONG AS IT ISN'T ONE OF DAD'S MEALS, I'M GOOD. AND NO, LIMA BEANS OR BRUSSELS SPROUTS. DEAL. YOU KNOW, I NOTICED YOU GUYS DON'T HAVE ANY CHRISTMAS DECORATIONS UP YET. WELL, CHRISTMAS WAS MORE OF MOM AND VANESSA'S THING, AND NANA DEE WILL DECORATE THE HOUSE WHEN SHE GETS HERE IN A FEW WEEKS. MM, WELL, YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES PUTTING UP HOLIDAY DECORATIONS CAN HELP PEOPLE GET INTO THE CHRISTMAS SPIRIT. MAYBE WE COULD SURPRISE MY GRANDMOTHER AND DECORATE THE HOUSE. WELL, I LOVE CHRISTMAS, SO JUST LET ME KNOW HOW I CAN HELP. OKAY. I SHOULD PROBABLY GET BACK TO THESE COOKIES AND START DINNER IF I'M GONNA WIN OVER THE JACKSON FAMILY. CAN I HELP YOU DECORATE THE COOKIES? I WOULD LOVE THAT, LINDSEY. OKAY, LOOK, YOU WANT TO TAKE RED? -OKAY. -GREAT, I'LL TAKE GREEN. AND JUST HOLD IT AT THE TOP. -OKAY. -PERFECT. NOW JUST SQUEEZE. -OH, YEAH. -ALL RIGHT, BETTER. YEAH, BETTER. BETTER BE READY FOR THESE SCOUTS. YOU REALLY GOT TO WORK ON THIS SLIDER, D.J. BUT I AM, DAD. NO, YOU'RE NOT. I NEED YOU TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE CONTROL. ALL RIGHT, KNEE UP. ALL RIGHT, NAIL IT. WELL, YOU KNOW, D.J.'S SLIDER IS COMING ALONG. AND HIS CURVE BALL IS ALREADY THERE. OKAY, DO IT AGAIN. BUT, DAD, I HAVE HOMEWORK AND I HAVE TO GO TO CHOIR PRACTICE AT CHURCH. WHAT'S THE PRIORITY? GOOD OR GREAT? GREAT. I WANT TO BE GREAT. SON, WHY DON'T YOU TAKE A BREAK, RIGHT? [ LAUGHS ] ALL RIGHT. BUCK, BUCK, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? TEAM DOC NEED TO LOOK AT THAT SHOULDER, DONOVON. IT'S FINE. YOU CAN'T FOOL FATHER TIME, BROTHER. IT'S FINE. ALL RIGHT? I JUST NEED TO FOCUS ON MY TRAINING REGIMENT, THAT'S ALL. WELL, THAT AIN'T THE ONLY THING YOU NEED TO FOCUS ON. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? THAT VIDEO IS BLOWING UP ON SOCIAL MEDIA. THEY JUST PICKED UP CARLOS RODRIGUEZ. YOU MEAN THAT LOUDMOUTH PITCHER FROM MIAMI? -MAN. -DIDN'T CONSULT ME. HEY, GUYS, I JUST FIGURED YOU MIGHT USE SOME WATER. RODRIGUEZ IS TRENDING IN THE NEWS RIGHT NOW AND HE'S TALKING ABOUT YOU. ABOUT ME? YO, FAM, IT'S OFFICIAL. YOUR BOY CARLOS RODRIGUEZ IS COMING TO THE ATL. THEY BROKE OPEN THE BANK AND SIGNED YOUR BOY TO A FOUR-YEAR $100 MILLION CONTRACT. $100 MILLION? THAT'S CRAZY. KEEP WATCHING. THEY AIN'T PAYING YOUR BOY $100 MILLION TO SIT ON THE BENCH SO SEE YOU SOON, DONOVON JACKSON. WAIT, CARLOS RODRIGUEZ IS COMING TO ATLANTA? HE'S SO GOOD, I MEAN, HE'S OKAY. NOT LIKE YOU. WHERE THE HELL'S YOUR AGENT WHEN YOU NEED HIM? D, UH... YOU'RE IN YOUR LAST YEAR OF YOUR CONTRACT. WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN? WELL, IT MEANS THAT YOU WERE THE FACE OF THE TEAM FOR 10 YEARS, BUT YOU CAN'T BLAME THEM FOR PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE. WELL, THEY'RE ACTING LIKE THE FUTURE IS NOW. JUST GET GLEN ON THE PHONE. I NEED TO GO OUT FRONT AND HELP LINDSEY PUT UP THE CHRISTMAS DECORATIONS LIKE I PROMISED HER. All: THREE, TWO, ONE! [ LAUGHING ] LOOK AT THAT. THAT'S NICE. -WOW. -VERY NICE. -IT LOOKS SO GOOD. -RIGHT ON. OH, MAN, YOUR GRANDMA'S GONNA LOVE THIS. OH, VANESSA, GIVE ME YOUR PHONE, I'LL TAKE SOME PICTURES. [ LAUGHS ] ALL RIGHT, GET CLOSE, GET CLOSE, GET CLOSE. SMILE! MERRY CHRISTMAS. All: MERRY CHRISTMAS! YES, NOW WHO'S HUNGRY? -ME, ME. -ME. TONIGHT, WE HAVE MONKFISH WITH TOMATO GARLIC SAUCE AND THE SAUTeED BROCCOLI RABE. BON APPeTIT. VANESSA, CAN YOU PLEASE PUT YOUR PHONE AWAY WHILE WE'RE AT THE DINNER TABLE? WHY CAN'T WE EVER EAT DINNER LIKE A NORMAL FAMILY? AT LEAST THE COOKIES WERE GOOD. [ HORN HONKING ] -BYE, DADDY, I -- WHOA, WHAT, WHAT? WHERE YOU GOING? I HAVE TO GO STUDY WITH RAY WE HAVE A TEST TOMORROW. TRY STUDYING BY OPENING THE BOOK INSTEAD OF YOUR LIPS TO... [ SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY ] I'VE GOT A MEETING IN TOWN AND I'LL BE HOME LATE. SO BE BACK BEFORE CURFEW. -OKAY, YOU GOT IT. HEY. BUCK SAID YOU WANTED TO TALK TO ME. YEAH, I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT TONIGHT'S DINNER. OKAY. IS SOMETHING WRONG? WELL, YOU TOLD ME YOU WERE GROCERY SHOPPING BEFORE WE ACTUALLY REVIEWED MY DIET PLAN, SO I GAVE YOU A PASS ON TONIGHT'S MEAL. BUT I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE IT IF YOU WOULD AT LEAST TRY TO FOLLOW MY RULES. WHAT I MADE TONIGHT WAS PRETTY HEALTHY. REALLY? YOU THINK SO? YEAH, I KNOW SO. WELL -- NOW DON'T BE SO HARD ON HER, DONOVON. IT'S THE FIRST MEAL. AS A TRAINED CHEF IN THE BEST KITCHENS, I KNOW HOW TO USE INGREDIENTS TO ADD FLAVOR TO THE MOST RIGID OF DIETS. THE MONKFISH WAS LOW CALORIE AND LOW FAT. OKAY, WELL WHAT ABOUT THE MASHED POTATOES AND THE SOUR CREAM? I MEAN, TALK ABOUT CARBS AND SATURATED FAT. ACTUALLY, THAT WAS WHIPPED CAULIFLOWER AND GREEK YOGURT. AND JUST IN CASE YOU'RE WONDERING, THE TOMATO SAUCE ON THE MONKFISH IS HIGH IN NUTRIENTS AND THE GARLIC CONTAINS ANTIOXIDANTS THAT PROTECT AGAINST ANTI-AGING AND CELL DAMAGE. WELL, IT SOUNDS LIKE THAT MIGHT HELP YOU WITH THAT SHOULDER, D. YOU REALLY SHOULD EXPAND YOUR IDEA OF WHAT HEALTHY FOOD LOOKS AND TASTES LIKE. SO WHAT ABOUT THIS CAKE, IS THAT HEALTHY, TOO? I'M A CHEF, NOT A MAGICIAN. THAT IS GRANDMA IDAMAE'S LEMON ICE BOX CAKE. AND SHE ALWAYS SAID SOME FOODS ARE JUST GOOD FOR THE SOUL. AMEN TO THAT. I EXPECT TO SEE SOME ITEMS FROM MY MENU FOR BREAKFAST IN THE MORNING. O COME ALL YE FAITHFUL JOYFUL AND TRIUMPHANT O COME YE O COME YE TO BETHLEHEM OH, HEY, CHEF CHLOE. HEY, YOU'RE UP LATE. TEST TOMORROW? NO, I'M JUST WORKING ON GETTING SOME OF MY COLLEGE APPLICATIONS ORGANIZED. BARDSLEE SCHOOL OF MUSIC. I DON'T THINK THEY HAVE A BASEBALL TEAM. THEY DON'T. MY CHURCH CHOIR DIRECTOR GAVE IT TO ME. BUT DAD, HE'S EXPECTING ME TO JOIN HIS ALMA MATER. AND THEN ON TO THE MAJOR LEAGUES. THAT'S DAD'S PLAN. YOU TOLD HIM ABOUT BARDSLEE? NO, I HAVEN'T EVEN BUILT UP THE NERVE TO TELL HIM THAT I WANT TO TRY OUT FOR THE CHRISTMAS SOLO AT CHURCH. HE'LL SAY I CAN'T BECAUSE IT INTERFERES WITH BASEBALL. I DON'T KNOW YOUR DAD WELL, BUT I THINK ANY FATHER WANTS THEIR SON TO BE HAPPY. YOU SHOULD TALK TO HIM. HOW DO I TELL MY DAD THAT THE PLAN THAT HE'S HAD FOR ME SINCE I WAS BORN ISN'T WHAT I WANT? [ DOOR CLOSES ] VANESSA. OH, MY GOD. ARE YOU JUST GETTING IN? WHY ARE YOU ASKING? YOU'RE NOT MY MOM. I KNOW. JUST -- IT'S PAST YOUR CURFEW. YOU JUST FOCUS ON COOKING BEFORE YOU END UP FIRED. AGAIN. MM! MM, THIS IS GOOD, GIRL. I'M GLAD YOU LIKE IT. HEY, WHERE THE KIDS? GOING TO SCHOOL. AND THAT'S LIKE YOU OVERSLEPT FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE MIDDLE SCHOOL AND I KNOW YOU'VE REALLY BEEN OVERDOING IT, SO I'M SURE YOUR BODY NEEDED TO REST. AND DON'T WORRY, I MADE THEIR BREAKFAST AND PREPARED THEIR LUNCHES. OOH, I'M SORRY. ARE THESE PANCAKES? YES, INDEED. [ LAUGHS ] CHLOE, PANCAKES ARE NOT ON THE MENU. I KNOW, BUT THESE ARE ACTUALLY GLUTEN FREE AND THE VEGGIE EGG SCRAMBLE CHECKS OFF MANY ITEMS ON YOUR LIST. I THINK I'M JUST GONNA HAVE A SMOOTHIE. OKAY, WHATEVER YOU WANT. WHERE'S THE KALE? OH, SORRY. I USED THE LAST OF THE KALE ON THE EGG SCRAMBLE. SO THERE'S KALE IN THE EGGS? UH-HUH AND TOMATOES AND RED AND GREEN PEPPERS AND MUSHROOMS. I'M GOING TO FARMER'S MARKET LATER, THOUGH, I CAN PICK UP SOME MORE KALE IF YOU WANT. NO, YOU KNOW, I'LL COME WITH YOU AFTER MY WORKOUT. I'M GOING TO GRAB SOME THINGS, TOO. SOUNDS GOOD. SO BUCK, CAN YOU DO ME A FAVOR? YOU MIND GRABBING THE CHRISTMAS DECORATIONS OUT OF THE GARAGE FOR ME? LINDSEY WANTS TO GET STARTED ON THE HOUSE BEFORE MY MOM GETS HERE. -SURE THING. -OH, BUCK, I'LL COME HELP YOU. ALL RIGHTY. MM. HMM. OH, WOW. [ BOTH LAUGH ] [ BELLS RINGING ] THANK YOU. I LOVE ORGANIC YELLOW SQUASH. NO WAY. YOU'RE DONOVON JACKSON. HOW ARE YOU DOING, MAN? HEY, MAN, CAN I GET YOUR AUTOGRAPH? SURE. THERE YOU GO. RIGHT THERE I WAS LIKE, I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS MAN. SWEET, APPRECIATE THAT. -MY PLEASURE. HEY, CAN I GET YOUR GIRLFRIEND TO TAKE OUR PICTURE? OH, I'M NOT HIS GIRLFRIEND. SURE, SHE CAN. NICE, APPRECIATE THAT, SWEETHEART. [ CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING ] NICE, I GOT A FEW. NICE, MAN, YOU'RE ONE OF MY FAVORITE PLAYERS, DONOVON. AND CARLOS RODRIGUEZ, TOTALLY DISRESPECTFUL FOR BLASTING YOU ON SOCIAL MEDIA. STRAIGHT TRASH, MAN. GUESS YOU'RE GONNA BE GETTING A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT CARLOS. [ EXHALES ] BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, IT'S GONNA TAKE A LOT MORE THAN JUST SOCIAL MEDIA CHATTER TO GET ME OFF MY GAME. YOU WORK REALLY HARD TRAINING. DO YOU EVER WORRY YOU'RE GONNA OVERDO IT? I KNOW MY BODY. I MEAN, YOU CAN'T REALLY TRAIN TOO HARD IF YOU WANT TO BE THE BEST, RIGHT? I MEAN, DON'T YOU PUT IN LONG HOURS TO BECOME A CHEF? YEAH, I DID. [ CHUCKLES ] I DID. BUT I WAS THIS CLOSE TO OWNING MY OWN RESTAURANT. BUT YOU GOT FIRED. WHO TOLD -- OH, LET ME GUESS. VANESSA. -VANESSA. -YEAH. -[ LAUGHS ] SO IF YOU DON'T MIND ME ASKING, WHY DID THEY LET YOU GO? WELL, I STARTED OUT COOKING SOUTHERN FOOD AND THEN I BEGAN PERFECTING FINE DINING. I STARTED GETTING A LOT OF CRITICAL ACCLAIM WHEN PEOPLE SAW MY FOOD AS ART. BUT THE RESTAURANT WANTED TO INCREASE PROFIT MARGINS, SO THEY KEPT WANTING TO CHANGE THE MENU. OH, YOU MEAN LIKE CHANGE THE MENU LIKE, I KEEP TRYING TO GET YOU TO CHANGE THE MENU? HEY, GIVE ME SOME CREDIT. I RESEARCH CREATIVE OPTIONS TO SUBSTITUTE FOR HEALTHY DISHES WITHOUT SACRIFICING FLAVOR. CHECK THIS OUT. THIS PLACE LOOKS LIKE A NICE SPOT FOR YOUR RESTAURANT. HMM. [ BICYCLE BELL RINGS ] IT'S A NICE LOCATION, BUT IT'S NOT EXACTLY FINE DINING, YOU'RE NOT AFRAID OF A LITTLE HARD WORK, ARE YOU? NO, BUT... LISTEN, IF YOU'RE INTERESTED, YOU'D BETTER CALL. SPACE IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD DOESN'T LAST LONG. MY PRIORITY RIGHT NOW IS MY NEW JOB, COOKING FOR MY DEMANDING NEW BOSS. -HEY, DAD. -HEY, PEACH PIE. MWAH, HOW WAS YOUR LAST DAY OF SCHOOL?

YOU ARE SUCH A LOSER. HEY, BE NICE TO YOUR SISTER. AT LEAST I KNOW HOW TO TELL TIME WHEN I MISS MY CURFEW. YOU MISSED YOUR CURFEW? DAD, I WAS JUST A FEW MINUTES LATE. I WARNED YOU ABOUT THAT. YOU'RE GROUNDED FOR TWO WEEKS. DAD, THAT'S ALMOST ALL OF WINTER BREAK. HEY, YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE MISSED YOUR CURFEW. I HATE YOU. YOU'RE THE WORST, LINDSEY. JUST STAY OUT OF MY LIFE! HEY! [ DOOR OPENS ] HEY. SINCE YOU MISSED YOUR WORKOUTS TODAY, WE'RE GONNA DOUBLE UP RIGHT NOW. DAD, CAN'T I SKIP WORKOUTS DURING CHRISTMAS BREAK AND FOCUS ON CHOIR PRACTICE IN CHURCH?

I WAS HOPING WE COULD TALK ABOUT COLLEGE. SON, A GREAT REEL WILL RESULT IN ALL THE COLLEGE OFFERS YOU NEED. MM! -CHEF CHLOE. -YEAH, BUCK? WE NEED TO TALK. WHAT'S WRONG? YOU DIDN'T LIKE THE FOOD? I HIRED YOU BECAUSE I SAW IN YOUR BIO THAT YOU COOKED SOUTHERN FOOD. WELL, YEAH, THAT'S HOW I STARTED MY CAREER. BUT FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS, I'VE BEEN PERFECTING THE FINE DINING EXPERIENCE. KIDS DON'T WANT NO FINE DINING EXPERIENCE. THEY WANT GOOD FOOD. AND I WANT THIS FAMILY TO ENJOY EACH OTHER AT DINNER AND RECONNECT, UNDERSTOOD? YEAH, UNDERSTOOD. GOOD. [ SIGHS ] [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] HEY, CAN I COME IN? YEAH, SURE, COME IN. I NOTICED YOU WERE UPSET EARLIER. JUST CHECKING ON YOU. EVERYTHING OKAY?

WELL, SHE DOESN'T ACT LIKE IT. SHE'S SO MEAN TO ME. I MISS MY MOM. SHE'D KNOW HOW TO FIX THIS. DO YOU KNOW WHY I'M SO INTO SCIENCE? I JUST THOUGHT YOU ENJOYED IT. IS THERE ANOTHER REASON? I DO ENJOY SCIENCE, BUT I WORK SO HARD ON IT BECAUSE I WANT TO FIND A CURE FOR MY MOM'S DISEASE. I DON'T WANT ANY OTHER KID TO LOSE THEIR MOM THE WAY WE DID. YOU ARE SO SMART. AND SO DETERMINED. I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA FIND A CURE. I REALLY HOPE SO. APOLOGIZE TO VANESSA. SHE'LL FORGIVE YOU. AND THEN, TOMORROW, WE'LL DECORATE THE HOUSE SOME MORE. OKAY?

ALL OF YOUR KIDS ARE REALLY GREAT. YEAH, THEY ARE GREAT, DESPITE MY SHORTCOMINGS. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WELL, I HEARD LINDSEY SAY THAT THE REASON WHY SHE STUDIES SCIENCE IS BECAUSE SHE WANTS TO FIND A CURE FOR HER MOM'S DISEASE. I FEEL LIKE THAT'S SOMETHING SHE SHOULD BE TELLING HER FATHER. I GUESS BASEBALL HAS GOT ME GONE SO MUCH, MAYBE TOO MUCH. YOU'RE A REALLY GOOD FATHER, DONOVON, BUT THESE KIDS NEED THEIR MOTHER, ESPECIALLY VANESSA. I MEAN, SHE REALLY NEEDS HER MOM. LINDSEY'S ALMOST A TEENAGER, TOO. THEY'RE JUST GROWING UP TOO FAST. YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT THE QUANTITY OF TIME THAT YOU SPEND WITH YOUR KIDS, THE QUALITY OF THAT TIME THAT MATTERS MOST.

YOUR BOY'S ARE OFFICIALLY READY TO TAKE OVER THE CITY AND CHASE THOSE CHAMPIONSHIP RINGS. BUT D. JACKSON, WHERE YOU AT? THIS CLOWN. HEY, SLUGGER. HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? BUCK SAID YOU MIGHT BE HERE. JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE OKAY. YEAH, I'M FINE. IT'S JUST SOMETIMES I COME HERE TO BLOW OFF SOME STEAM. THAT'S ALL. [ CLEARS THROAT ] CAN I TRY? SURE. NEVER HIT A BASEBALL BEFORE. SO LET'S BACK UP, GET YOURSELF IN THE BOX. ALL RIGHT, GOOD. NOW YOU WANT YOUR BACK KNEE, YOUR HIP, AND YOUR HEAD, ALL IN A STRAIGHT LINE, ALL RIGHT? NOW IN YOUR HANDS. ALL RIGHT. THERE... [ SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY ] THERE YOU GO. ONE PALM UP, ONE PALM DOWN. OKAY? -IS THAT ALL RIGHT? ALL RIGHT, SO NOW YOU JUST STEP INTO THE PITCH AND SWING. OKAY, I THINK I GOT IT. ALL RIGHT, LET ME ADJUST THE SPEED. NO, NO, NO, NO. LEAVE IT WHERE IT IS. WHAT'S THE POINT IN HANGING WITH A PRO IF YOU CAN'T PLAY LIKE A PRO? YEAH, BUT THIS IS ON THE SETTINGS THAT I USE. I DOUBT YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO HIT THE BALL AT THE SAME SPEED. IT'S THE WEEK BEFORE CHRISTMAS. IF I HIT THE BALL, YOU HAVE TO LET ME COOK WHATEVER I WANT THIS WEEK. YOU MUST LOVE LOSING TO ME. OKAY. HOW'S THAT, COACH? I THOUGHT YOU TOLD ME YOU NEVER HIT A BASEBALL BEFORE. YES, BUT I DIDN'T TELL YOU THAT I WENT TO COLLEGE ON A SOFTBALL SCHOLARSHIP. THAT WAS A HIT. YOU'RE UP. HUSTLED BY MY OWN CHEF. PRETTY GOOD ON THE GOLF COURSE, TOO. OH, REALLY? SO YOU'RE HANK AARON AND TIGER WOODS, TOO. PRETTY MUCH. OKAY. KEEP THAT ELBOW UP. WHOA, WHOA, HEY, HEY, HEY, YOU OKAY? AH, YEAH, I'M FINE. I JUST SHOULD'VE WARMED UP MORE, THAT'S ALL. HEY, WE SHOULD GO HOME. HAVE BUCK LOOK AT THAT. COME ON. OH, TAKE A BREAK FROM TRAINING, LET YOUR SHOULDER HEAL, MAN. I GOTTA BE READY FOR THE SEASON. WHAT'S THIS ANOTHER CARLOS VIDEO? NO, THIS VIDEO IS FROM THE BATTING CAGE. IT IS ON 360 SPORTS. DOES THE TEAM KNOW ABOUT THIS? WELL, GLEN IS FLYING DOWN TOMORROW SO YOU CAN TALK STRATEGY. AND THE GM IS SURE TO BE CALLING SOON. YOU KNOW WHAT, LAST WEEK THEY WERE SAYING, I'M STILL THEIR GUY. THEN THEY HIRE MY REPLACEMENT. AND NOW THIS VIDEO. YOU DIDN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS. AND WHAT ABOUT YOUR SHOULDER NOW? I MEAN. BUCK, COME ON, MAN, I'M NOT READY TO RETIRE. WHY NOT JUST GO OUT ON TOP? THREE CHAMPIONSHIPS, TWO MVP TITLES. THEN WHAT WOULD I DO? I'M A BASEBALL PLAYER, BUCK, THAT'S -- THAT'S WHO I AM. BASEBALL IS NOT WHO YOU ARE. THAT'S WHAT YOU DO. WHO YOU ARE IS AN INCREDIBLE FATHER. AND MAYBE IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO FOCUS ON YOUR FAMILY AND WHATEVER HAPPENED FIVE YEARS AGO FOR YOUR SAKE AND THE KIDS. SO YOU'RE SAYING I HAVEN'T DEALT WITH OLIVIA'S DEATH? WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT YOU SHUT OUT THE HOLIDAYS AND YOU FOCUS ON TRAINING SO YOU WON'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH OLIVIA'S PASSING. HAVE YOU EVEN CONSIDERED HOW THE PAST FIVE YEARS HAS BEEN FOR THE KIDS? AND SURE, YOUR MOTHER, SHE TAKES CARE OF KIDS DURING THE SEASON WHEN YOU'RE ON THE ROAD. BUT D.J., HE'S GOING TO COLLEGE SOON AND VANESSA'S RIGHT AFTER HIM. THIS MAY BE THE TIME THAT YOU NEED TO STAY HOME MORE BECAUSE YOU NEVER GET THIS TIME BACK WITH YOUR CHILDREN. YOU DON'T THINK I KNOW THAT? YOU DON'T THINK MY KIDS UNDERSTAND WHY I WORK SO HARD FOR THIS FAMILY, EVEN TAKING CARE OF MY MOTHER? I MEAN, MY FATHER IS NOT HERE TO DO IT. HE BOUNCED BEFORE I WAS EVEN BORN. YOU DON'T KNOW IF HE WANTED TO BE THERE FOR YOU AND MAYBE HE JUST COULDN'T DO -- MAYBE WHAT, BUCK? DON'T MAKE EXCUSES FOR MY FATHER, BUCK. BUT IF HE WANTED TO BE HERE, HE WOULD. BUT HE'S NOT. IT'S TOO LATE. I DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT MAN. DAD, I GOT THE SOLO FOR THE CHURCH CHRISTMAS CONCERT. CONGRATULATIONS, D.J. JUST DON'T LET IT INTERFERE WITH YOUR TRAINING. YEAH. HEY. BROUGHT YOU SOMETHING TO EAT. YOU KNOW YOUR DAYS ARE NUMBERED. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? NANA DEE IS COMING AND SHE'S NOT GONNA LIKE HOW YOU'RE TRYING TO WORM YOUR WAY INTO MY DAD'S LIFE. SHE'S GONNA HIT THE ROOF WHEN SHE SEES THAT VIDEO. YOU WON'T MAKE THROUGH CHRISTMAS. VANESSA, I'M ONLY HERE TO HELP. I'M NOT HUNGRY. BYE! [ KEYBOARD CLACKING ] OH, HOLY NIGHT THE STARS ARE BRIGHTLY SHINING WHAT'S UP, CHLOE? -HEY. -WHAT YOU DOING OUT HERE? JUST THINKING ABOUT MY NEXT RECIPE. SHRIMP AND GRITS. SHRIMP AND GRITS. IT WAS MY GRANDMOTHER'S SPECIALTY. THE HEALTHY WAY. NO BUTTER, NO BACON. I'LL SAUTe THE SHRIMP IN COCONUT OIL AND SEASONED IT WITH PINK HIMALAYAN SALT. HMM. HOW'D THE MEETING GO? NOT TOO GOOD. WHAT'D THEY SAY? WELL, THEY DIDN'T EXACTLY SAY CARLOS IS THEIR GUY, BUT GLEN SAID IT BEST, YOU DON'T PAY ANYBODY THAT MUCH MONEY FOR THEM TO PLAY BACKUP. AS FAR AS MY SHOULDER, THEY'RE FLYING THE TEAM DOCTOR DOWN HERE TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK. SO WHAT'S NEXT? I JUST WANT TO PLAY. JUST WANNA DO MY JOB. I DON'T WANT ANYBODY PUSHING ME OUT UNTIL I'M READY. I GET IT. SORRY ABOUT THAT BATTING CAGE VIDEO. IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT. D.J. IS SO GOOD. IT WAS ONE OF HIS FAVORITE THINGS TO DO WITH HIS MOTHER. KIND OF A STRESS RELIEVER. YOU KNOW, HE'S INTERESTED IN THE BARDSLEE SCHOOL MUSIC? WHAT, DO THEY HAVE SOME KIND OF WORLD-RENOWNED BASEBALL PROGRAM I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT? -I'M GUESSING NOT. HE LIKES TO SING AND PLAY THE PIANO, BUT NOT ANYTHING HE'S GONNA DO AS A CAREER. WHY NOT, I MEAN, 'CAUSE THE DAY WAS BORN, YOU DECIDED HE WAS GONNA BE A BASEBALL PLAYER JUST LIKE YOU? SORRY, I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT. I'M GONNA GET STARTED ON MY RECIPE. SO MY SISTERS AND I SAW THAT VIDEO OF YOU AND MY DAD ON YOUR LITTLE DATE. OKAY, HOLD ON, D.J. D.J., LOOK AT ME. IT WAS DEFINITELY NOT A DATE. RELAX, I THINK IT WAS PRETTY COOL. HEY, D.J. IT'S GETTING LATE. RIGHT. GOODNIGHT, DAD. GOODNIGHT, MAN. CHEF CHLOE. GOODNIGHT, D.J. -CHLOE? -YEAH? Woman: DONOVON? OH, DONOVON? DONOVON, DARLING, MERRY CHRISTMAS. HEY, I WASN'T EXPECTING YOU UNTIL TOMORROW. WELL, VANESSA'S BEEN CALLING, BEGGING ME TO COME, SO SURPRISE, I'M HERE. -NANA DEE! -OH, MY GOODNESS. [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ] -MERRY CHRISTMAS. -OH, MERRY CHRISTMAS. -ARE THOSE PRESENTS FOR US? -THEY SURE ARE. WHY DON'T YOU HELP OLD BUCK GET THOSE PRESENTS UNDER THE TREE. -[ LAUGHS ] -[ GROANS ] I AM SO GLAD TO SEE YOU GOT SOME HELP. A FULL-TIME HOUSEKEEPER IS EXACTLY WHAT THIS FAMILY NEEDS. OH, NO, MOM, THIS IS CHLOE, CHEF CHLOE, BUT SHE'S NOT THE HOUSEKEEPER. IT'S SO NICE TO MEET YOU. WAIT, YOU'RE THAT WOMAN FROM THE VIDEO WHO HAS MY SON IN BATTING CAGES WHEN HE SHOULD BE RESTING HIS SHOULDER. OH, NO, THAT WAS -- I WASN'T. OH, NO, CHLOE WAS ACTUALLY JUST HELPING ME OUT AT THE BATTING CAGES, MOM. OH! CHEF CHLOE. VANESSA'S BEEN TELLING ME HOW YOU'VE BEEN HELPING OUT SINCE YOU ARRIVED. YOU KNOW WHAT, MOM? IT IS SO NICE TO SEE YOU. WOW, WHAT A SURPRISE. AND I HAVE ANOTHER SURPRISE, TOO. HOW RUDE WOULD IT BE TO SHOW UP WITHOUT A GIFT FOR MY SON? WELL, HEY, YOU WALKED IN WITH ALL THESE BAGS. YOU PRETTY MUCH BOUGHT THE ENTIRE STORE. WHAT COULD POSSIBLY BE LEFT FOR ME? MM! [ LAUGHS ] MERRY CHRISTMAS, BABY. OH! SHAVONNE? WHO'S THAT? IT'S DONOVON'S EX, SHAVONNE BAYLOR. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? YOUR MOTHER INVITED ME. I KNEW YOU'D BE BUSY TRAINING AND WOULDN'T HAVE TIME TO GET THE HOUSE IN ORDER. SO I ASKED SHAVONNE TO COME AND HELP AND SHE'S GONNA STAY WITH US THROUGH CHRISTMAS. NOW, ISN'T THAT A WONDERFUL CHRISTMAS SURPRISE? MOM, THE KIDS HAVE ALREADY DECORATED THE HOUSE. I'M SURE THE KIDS TRIED THEIR BEST, DONOVON, BUT, UH... LET A PROFESSIONAL DECORATOR TAKE IT FROM HERE, OKAY? [ Lowered voice ] MA! SHE CAN'T STAY HERE. WE'RE NOT TOGETHER ANYMORE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? [ Lowered voice ] WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO? KICK HER OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET, IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT? WE WILL TALK ABOUT THIS TOMORROW. [ Normal voice ] NOW, LET'S GET YOU INTO SOME HOLIDAY CHEER. JOY TO THE WORLD THE LORD HAS COME CHEF CHLOE, THIS BREAKFAST IS SO GOOD. THANKS. WHERE'S VANESSA? PROBABLY CHASING HER SHADOW. IT'S ALL ABOUT THE ANGLES, VANESSA AND FINDING YOUR LIGHT. -YOU TAKE THE BEST SELFIES. -OH, IT'S AN ART, HONEY. I'LL HAVE ALL THE BOYS SLIDING THROUGH YOUR DMs. [ LAUGHS ] NO, THANKS. YOU'D BE SO MUCH PRETTIER, LINDSEY, IF YOU LOSE THOSE LITTLE GLASSES. THEN I'D BE A LITTLE BLIND? SO. WHATEVER. SHE'S A LOST CAUSE. WELL, LINDSEY, AT LEAST TRY SOME PERFUME. SHAVONNE LET ME TRY SOME OF HER PERFUME. ISN'T IT PRETTY? -SMELLS LIKE DESPERATION. -[ LAUGHS ] CAN YOU NOT AROUND THE FOOD? OKAY. GOOD MORNING! HOW AM I GRANDBABIES DOING? All: GOOD MORNING, NANA DEE. CHLOE, COULD YOU FETCH ME SOME COFFEE? Donovon: HEY, FAMILY. All: MORNING, DAD. -MORNING, MA. -HEY. GOOD MORNING, HONEY. GOOD MORNING, SHAVONNE. HOW'D YOU SLEEP? OH, NOT SO GREAT. I'M NOT USED TO SLEEPING IN THE GUEST BEDROOM. THAT MATTRESS IS A LITTLE LUMPY. I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT. LISTEN, AFTER WE HAVE THIS WONDERFUL BREAKFAST THAT CHLOE MADE, ANYONE WHO WANTS TO GO CHRISTMAS SHOPPING, MEET ME AT THE CAR IN 20 MINUTES. OKAY. OH, HONEY, I WAS HOPING WE COULD GO TO OUR SPOT ON THE WATERFRONT AND CATCH UP. OH, I NEED TO TAKE MY KIDS CHRISTMAS SHOPPING. SHAVONNE, I'M SORRY. YOU KNOW WHAT? I'LL GO, TOO. I ACTUALLY NEED TO GRAB A FEW PRESENTS, SO I'LL GO FRESHEN UP. -HEY, CHLOE? -WHAT? CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR A MINUTE? SORRY, I HAVE TO CLEAN THE KITCHEN AND GO SHOPPING FOR MY CHRISTMAS EVE MENU. I SEE VANESSA WAS RIGHT. YOU ARE COOKING UP MORE THAN MEALS FOR MY SON. I'M SORRY, WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I SAW THE VIDEO. THAT BATTING CAGE INCIDENT PUT MY SON'S CAREER IN JEOPARDY. WHAT WERE YOU DOING OUT THERE ANYWAY? MS. JACKSON, IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK. LOOK, CHLOE, LET ME BE CLEAR. I WON'T LET ANYONE COME BETWEEN MY SON AND HIS BASEBALL CAREER. AND WHILE SHAVONNE AND DONOVON ARE BROKEN UP, I KNOW HE STILL LOVES HER AND HE DOESN'T NEED TO FRATERNIZE WITH THE HELP. MY INTENTION IS TO HELP THIS FAMILY THROUGH THE HOLIDAYS. AFTER THAT, I'LL BE LEAVING. GOOD, SEE THAT YOU DO, CHLOE. HI, I WAS CALLING TO SEE IF THE RESTAURANT SPACE ON SUMMIT WAS STILL AVAILABLE? I'D LIKE TO SEE IT TODAY. [ CLEARS THROAT ] IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR DONOVON, HE TOOK THE KIDS SHOPPING FOR CHRISTMAS PRESENTS A FEW HOURS AGO. OH, GOOD. I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ALONE, DOLORES. YOU DON'T NEED TO TALK TO ME. YOU NEED TO TALK TO THE TEAM ABOUT THIS BATTING CAGE VIDEO AND THIS MESS WITH CARLOS RODRIGUEZ. HE IS HUMILIATING MY SON. THIS ISN'T ABOUT CARLOS. THIS IS ABOUT MY SON. IT'S TIME TO TELL HIM, DOLORES. YOUR SON? HOW DARE YOU CALL HIM THAT AFTER YOU RAN OUT ON YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES? WE NEED TO TELL DONOVON THE TRUTH. AND WHICH VERSION OF THE TRUTH WOULD YOU LIKE TO TELL HIM, BUCK? THERE AREN'T VERSIONS OF THE TRUTH, DOLORES. THE TRUTH'S THE TRUTH. I THINK YOU AND I WOULD TELL DONOVON TWO VERY DIFFERENT STORIES WHEN IT COMES TO THE TRUTH. OKAY, WHAT'S YOUR VERSION? THE TRUTH IS, I RAISED OUR SON ON MY OWN. THE TRUTH IS YOU CAME BACK 12 YEARS LATER AND WORMED YOUR WAY INTO DONOVON'S LIFE WHEN YOU LEARNED HE HAD POTENTIAL TO BE A PROFESSIONAL BASEBALL PLAYER. AND THE TRUTH? IS YOU HAVE BEEN RIDING HIS COATTAILS EVER SINCE. THOSE 12 YEARS WITHOUT MY -- OUR SON, WERE THE HARDEST OF MY LIFE, DOLORES. WHEN I COULDN'T BEAR FOR HIM TO BE AWAY FROM ME ANY LONGER, I CAME BACK TO CLEVELAND AND I KNEW I WOULD DO ANYTHING TO BE IN HIS LIFE. I WAS GONNA TELL DONOVON THAT I WAS HIS FATHER AS SOON AS I CAME BACK. YOU'RE MY FATHER? -[ GASPS ] -DONOVON. I'VE BEEN TRYING TO TELL YOU THIS FOR YEARS. I JUST DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. SO YOU'VE BEEN LYING TO ME ALL THIS TIME. IT WAS COMPLICATED, DONOVON. WELL, WE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO TELL YOU, YOU DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO TELL ME THAT THE MAN I'VE BEEN SPENDING THE LAST 25 YEARS WITH WAS MY FATHER? D, I'VE BEEN GRATEFUL ALL THESE YEARS TO BE IN YOUR LIFE. I DIDN'T WANT TO RUIN OUR RELATIONSHIP. IT'S A RELATIONSHIP BUILT ON A LIE, BUCK. -I'M SORRY, SON. -DON'T YOU DARE CALL ME SON. GET OUT OF MY HOUSE AND OUT OF MY LIFE. -DONOVON, LET'S TALK -- -I MEAN IT, BUCK. LEAVE. DONOVON. MOM, I... I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU KEPT ME FROM MY FATHER ALL THESE YEARS. ALL THESE YEARS. SO WHAT'S FOR BREAKFAST, ZOE? -IT'S CHLOE. -SORRY, CHLOE. WHAT'S FOR BREAKFAST? TODAY WE HAVE A TOMATO ASPARAGUS MUSHROOM FRITTATA, CHICKEN SAUSAGE, AND HONEY CORNBREAD -- I'LL PASS, BUT I DO NEED TO USE THE KITCHEN LATER TODAY TO MAKE A CAKE. OH, YEAH, SURE. FEEL FREE. I'LL JUST FOCUS ON MY CHRISTMAS EVE DINNER MENU. PERFECT! I'LL TEXT YOU A LIST OF THE INGREDIENTS THAT YOU CAN PICK UP FOR ME. BYE! [ CELLPHONE VIBRATES ] HI, IT'S CHLOE. Hi, Chloe, it's Melanie from Savannah Realty. Someone signed the contract to lease the Summit location. I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT. THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME KNOW. [ SIGHS ] DAD, I NEED TO GET TO CHURCH SO I CAN WARM UP WITH THE CHOIR. HEY, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, SHAVONNE! VANESSA! COME ON, WE'RE GONNA BE LATE FOR CHURCH. I LOVE THIS NECKLACE. [ SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY ] OH, THANK YOU. ADORABLE. TA-DA! ISN'T SHE LOVELY? OH, LOOK, THEY'VE MORPHED INTO THE SAME PERSON, THE MORON MINDMELD IS OFFICIALLY COMPLETE. LINDSEY, BE NICE. IT'S CHRISTMAS EVE. I COULD HAVE FIXED YOUR LOOK, TOO, LINDSEY, THAT NECKLACE IS DREADFUL. IT WAS MY MOM'S. BEFORE WE GO, I HAVE A SURPRISE. I REDECORATED THE CHRISTMAS TREE LAST NIGHT. COME. COME SEE. D.J.: WHAT HAPPENED TO OUR TREE? WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL THE COLORS? WHERE'S MOM'S ORNAMENTS? I PUT THEM IN THE GARAGE TO GO TO CHARITY. NOW THIS TREE IS ON TREND FOR THE SEASON. DON'T YOU JUST LOVE IT? SHAVONNE, CHRISTMAS ISN'T ABOUT TRENDS. IT'S ABOUT FAMILY MEMORIES. DAD, CAN WE JUST GO TO CHURCH? I CAN'T BE LATE. COME ON. AND AS WE ARE GATHERED HERE ON THIS BLESSED CHRISTMAS EVE AT ZION BAPTIST CHURCH, I'M REMINDED OF A CHILD THAT WAS BORN IN A MANGER THAT WOULD CHANGE THE WORLD. A CHILD KNEW THAT WE WERE ALL WORTH SAVING NO MATTER THE SIN, AMEN? All: AMEN. TAKE YOUR TIME, PASTOR, TAKE YOUR TIME. AND I AM CALLED UPON BY GOD TO TELL EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU THAT WE'VE ALL MADE MISTAKES AND WE HAVE ALL SINNED AND IF JESUS CAN FORGIVE YOU AND ME, THEN WHO ARE WE TO STAND IN JUDGMENT OF ANYBODY, AMEN? All: AMEN. AND IT IS MY WISH THAT FOR EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU ON THIS CHRISTMAS EVE THAT YOU FIND YOUR FAITH AND YOUR FORGIVENESS, FOR THEY WILL TRULY SET YOU FREE. I'M SORRY. AND NOW, TO CLOSE OUT OUR CHRISTMAS EVE SERVICE, WE HAVE A SPECIAL MUSICAL SELECTION BY D.J. JACKSON. [ APPLAUSE ] COME ON, D.J. WHOO! GO, D.J.! JOY... TO... THE WORLD THE LORD IS COME LET EARTH RECEIVE HER KING LET EVERY HEART PREPARE HIM ROOM LET HEAVEN AND NATURE SING LET HEAVEN AND NATURE SING AND HEAVEN HEAVEN AND NATURE SING [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] LINDSEY, CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR A MINUTE? SURE. SO I JUST... JUST WANTED TO SAY I'M SORRY FOR THE WAY I'VE BEEN TREATING YOU. YOU ARE? I JUST GET SO ANGRY AROUND THE HOLIDAYS. I MISS MOM SO MUCH, AND I GUESS IT'S EASIER FOR ME TO TAKE IT OUT ON YOU. YOU DON'T DESERVE THAT, LIN. I ALREADY LOST A MOM, I CAN'T LOSE MY BABY SIS, TOO. YOU MAY GET ON MY NERVES SOMETIMES, BUT YOU CAN NEVER LOSE ME. SO I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD WHIP UP A SPECIAL EXPERIMENT. FOR WHO? WELL, LET'S JUST SAY I DON'T LIKE WHAT SHAVONNE SAID ABOUT YOUR NECKLACE AND WHAT SHE DID TO OUR CHRISTMAS TREE. DON'T WORRY, SIS. I'M ALREADY TWO STEPS AHEAD OF YOU. THAT'S MY BABY SIS. TA-DA! TIME FOR CHOCOLATE CAKE. OOH, UH, SHAVONNE, I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE CAKE. WELL, THE SHAPE DOESN'T IMPACT THE TASTE, HONEY. WHO WANTS THE FIRST PIECE? IS THAT EVEN CAKE? VANESSA, IT'S DELICIOUS, YOU HAVE TO TRY IT. COME ON! WHEN IS IT GONNA KICK IN? YOU'VE GOT TO BE PATIENT. I'M ON A DIET. [ STOMACH RUMBLES ] OH, GOSH. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, DEAR? [ GROANS ] MY STOMACH IS... SHAVONNE, I HAVE ANTACIDS IN MY ROOM. I'M FINE. CHLOE! SHOULDN'T YOU BE WASHING DISHES? IT'S FAMILY TIME. SHAVONNE, THAT WASN'T NICE. OOH. [ GASPS ] OH, MY GOD, OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD. GOT HER. YOUR KIDS ARE OUT OF CONTROL. I WAS IN THAT BATHROOM ALL NIGHT. SHAVONNE, I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET, BUT YOU NEED TO CALM DOWN AND LOWER YOUR VOICE. I DON'T CARE IF THEY HEAR ME! THIS IS WHY I TOLD YOU THEY NEED TO GO TO BOARDING SCHOOL. OKAY. THEY LACK DISCIPLINE AND ARE RUNNING WILD. THIS IS WHY WE BROKE UP. WHY WOULD I WANT TO BE WITH ANYBODY WHO WANTS TO SEND MY KIDS AWAY? I DON'T MEAN TO INTERRUPT, BUT THE GIRLS WANTED TO COME IN AND SAY SORRY. OH, PLEASE, CHLOE, YOU'RE PROBABLY THE ONE THAT PUT THOSE TWO LITTLE BRATS UP TO THIS. HEY, WATCH HOW YOU TALK ABOUT MY KIDS. YOU KNOW WHAT, SHAVONNE, I THINK YOU NEED TO LEAVE. DONOVON'S RIGHT, SHAVONNE. YOU NEED TO LEAVE. ARE YOU TAKING THEIR SIDE, TOO? YOU HAVE OVERSTAYED YOUR WELCOME. CHRISTMAS IS FOR FAMILY. AND IF YOU WANT TO SEND MY GRANDCHILDREN AWAY TO BOARDING SCHOOL, YOU WILL NEVER BE A PART OF THIS FAMILY. I WAS WRONG TO INVITE YOU HERE. YOU NEED TO LEAVE. DONOVON. I'M SO SORRY, SON, FOR SO MANY THINGS. FOR PUSHING YOU TO GET BACK WITH SHAVONNE WITHOUT REALIZING WHAT KIND OF WOMAN SHE WAS. I'M OBVIOUSLY NOT THE MAN FOR HER. SHE WAS JUST THE FIRST WOMAN THAT I DATED SERIOUSLY SINCE OLIVIA PASSED SO. I THINK I WAS JUST TRYING TO FILL THE VOID. I ALSO WANT TO APOLOGIZE AND -- AND HOPE YOU CAN ONE DAY FORGIVE ME FOR KEEPING YOUR FATHER AWAY FROM YOU ALL THESE YEARS. THAT WAS SO WRONG. DON'T -- DON'T EVEN MENTION HIM. BUCK NOT TELLING YOU HE WAS YOUR FATHER FOR ALL THESE YEARS WAS MY FAULT, DONOVON, NOT HIS. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WE WERE 20 YEARS OLD WHEN WE MET. I WAS SO IN LOVE WITH HIM. WE SPENT EVERY DAY TOGETHER. HE SIGNED WITH THE CLEVELAND FARM TEAM SHORTLY AFTER AND THEN OUT OF THE BLUE, HE BROKE UP WITH ME. WHY? HE SAID THAT SINCE HE WAS GOING TO BE ON THE ROAD ALL THE TIME, IT WOULDN'T BE FAIR TO ME BECAUSE WE WOULD HARDLY BE TOGETHER. I DIDN'T BELIEVE HIM. I THOUGHT HE JUST DIDN'T LOVE ME. AND AFTER HE LEFT, I FOUND OUT I WAS... PREGNANT WITH YOU. WHY WOULD HE JUST ABANDON YOU LIKE THAT? HE COULD HAVE COME BACK, HE COULD'VE HELPED YOU RAISE ME. I TOLD HIM NOT TO. WHY WOULD YOU DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT? HE BROKE MY HEART WHEN HE BROKE UP WITH ME. AND BY THE TIME HE FOUND OUT ABOUT YOU, THAT HEARTBREAKING TURNED TO SO MUCH HATE. I REFUSED TO TALK TO HIM. HE SENT WHAT MONEY HE COULD. AND HE WROTE LETTERS FOR YEARS, ASKING ABOUT YOU. I WOULD NEVER ANSWER HIM, I'D STUFF HIM IN A BOX IN THE ATTIC. AFTER BOUNCING FROM TEAM TO TEAM, HE CAME BACK TO CLEVELAND. I TOLD HIM TO STAY AWAY FROM YOU AND TO NEVER TELL YOU THE TRUTH, BUT... HE -- HE COULDN'T HELP IT. HE HAD TO BE NEAR YOU, HE HAD TO BE NEAR HIS SON. SO THAT'S WHEN HE BECAME THE BASEBALL COACH WHEN I WAS IN MIDDLE SCHOOL. HE WANTED TO GET TO KNOW YOU. AND THAT'S THE ONLY WAY HE COULD. ALL THESE YEARS, YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME. I THOUGHT I WAS PROTECTING YOU. BUT I WAS BEING SELFISH. I THOUGHT IF YOU FOUND OUT THAT I KEPT YOUR FATHER FROM YOU, THAT YOU WOULD CHOOSE HIM OVER ME. WHY WOULD I EVER DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT? YOU'RE MY MOTHER, I LOVE YOU. HONESTLY... WHEN YOU TOLD BUCK TO LEAVE, THE LOOK ON BUCK'S FACE BROKE MY HEART ALL OVER AGAIN. BUCK HAS ALWAYS BEEN YOUR FATHER. AND HE ALWAYS WILL BE. GOODNIGHT, SON. [ WHISTLE BLOWS ] WAKE UP! DAD, WHAT'S GOING ON? DID YOU REALLY WAKE US UP TO WORK OUT ON CHRISTMAS MORNING? WHAT'S HAPPENING? WHAT'S THE MATTER? NO WORKOUTS THIS MORNING IT'S CHRISTMAS. [ LAUGHS ] THAT'S COOL. WHERE'S VANESSA? HEY, DOES ANYBODY SMELL BACON? HEY, MERRY CHRISTMAS, SWEETHEART. MERRY CHRISTMAS, SLEEPYHEADS. WHAT'S ALL THIS? WELL, I WANTED TO START CHRISTMAS OFF WITH BRUNCH LIKE MOM USED TO DO. MAYBE YOU COULD HELP ME, CHLOE? YEAH, I'D LOVE TO, VANESSA.

[ LAUGHTER ] -OH, HOW'S IT LOOK? -NICE, PERFECT. Lindsey: LOOK, THE TREE! I THOUGHT YOUR MOM'S ORNAMENTS SHOULD GO BACK ON THE TREE, ESPECIALLY THE ANGEL. I STAYED UP ALL NIGHT. HOPE YOU GUYS LIKE IT. OH, WE LOVE IT, CHLOE. THANK YOU. OF COURSE. MERRY CHRISTMAS. HEY, COME ON, LET'S OPEN UP SOME GIFTS. -[ LAUGHS ] -LET'S DO IT. ALL RIGHT, KIDS, LET'S OPEN SOME PRESENTS. [ LAUGHS ] DAD, ARE YOU SAYING THAT I CAN GO TO BARDSLEE? YOU KNOW, THEY DON'T HAVE A BASEBALL TEAM, RIGHT? [ LAUGHS ] YEAH, I KNOW. BUT SOMEONE ONCE TOLD ME BASEBALL WAS MY DREAM AND NOT YOURS, SON. NOW IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO GO FIND YOURS. THANKS, DAD. I LOVE YOU. -I LOVE YOU, TOO, MAN. MY OWN SCIENCE LAB? THANK YOU, I LOVE IT. WHERE'S IT GOING IN THE HOUSE? WELL, GOT A CONTRACTOR COMING TO CHANGE PART OF MY GYM INTO A SCIENCE LAB JUST FOR YOU. BUT YOU GOT TO USE YOUR POWERS FOR GOOD, LINDSEY. I PROMISE. WHOA, DADDY, THANK YOU. HEY, YOU'RE GONNA NEED IT WHEN YOU GET INTO THE SAVANNAH ALL ARTS PROGRAM. I LOVE IT. THANK YOU. -YOU'RE WELCOME, BABY.

LINDSEY, VANESSA, AND D.J., THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS IN MY LIFE -- FAMILY. -DAD. -AW. LOVE YOU, GUYS. DONOVON. YES, MA'AM. I DON'T DESERVE A PRESENT. I FORGIVE YOU. I WANT YOU TO FORGIVE YOURSELF. THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING YOU'VE EVER DONE FOR ME. NO NEED TO THANK ME, SON. I AM PROUD OF YOUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS ON THE FIELD. AND I AM PROUD OF YOUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS AS A FATHER. I WANT YOU TO OPEN MY GIFT FIRST. [ CHUCKLES ] MA, YOU... MOM, YOU KEPT ALL OF BUCK'S LETTERS. I TOLD YOU I SAVED THEM, EVERY SINGLE ONE. I HAD THEM OVERNIGHTED. [ DOORBELL RINGS ] WHO COULD THAT BE ON CHRISTMAS MORNING? THAT IS PROBABLY THE OTHER HALF OF MY GIFT FOR YOU. MERRY CHRISTMAS, DONOVON. NOW LOOK, I'LL LEAVE IF YOU WANT ME TO. BUT I NEED YOU TO KNOW THAT I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO BE IN YOUR LIFE SINCE THE DAY YOU WERE BORN. AND I'M SORRY THAT I DECEIVED YOU. I WISH I COULD CHANGE THE PAST, BUT I CAN'T. IF YOU COULD JUST GIVE ME THE CHANCE, I PROMISE TO SPEND THE REST OF MY LIFE BEING THE BEST FATHER AND GRANDFATHER I KNOW HOW. I LOVE YOU, SON. WAIT. I'VE WAITED MY ENTIRE LIFE TO HEAR THOSE WORDS. I LOVE YOU, DAD. -HEY, IT'S UNCLE BUCK. -HEY, IT'S UNCLE BUCK. -I MEAN GRANDPA BUCK. -GRANDPA BUCK. AND WE PRAY THAT YOU BLESS THIS FAMILY AND THIS FOOD, AMEN. All: AMEN. -NOW LET'S EAT. -HOLD ON. LOOK, I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT THIS CHRISTMAS HAS BEEN THE BEST CHRISTMAS THIS FAMILY HAS SEEN IN A VERY LONG TIME. -YES, IT IS. -THE BEST CHRISTMAS. -YEAH, FOR SURE, DAD. -TOTALLY. AND I THINK THE REASON WHY IT'S BEEN SUCH A WONDERFUL CHRISTMAS IS BECAUSE OF YOU, CHLOE. YOU'VE COME INTO OUR LIVES WHEN WE WERE ALL JUST A LITTLE BIT LOST. Dolores: I AGREE. THANK CHLOE. THIS HAS BEEN A VERY SPECIAL CHRISTMAS FOR ME, TOO. CHLOE, WE GOT YOU SOMETHING. CHECK YOUR PHONE. SO I'VE BEEN TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS OF OUR MEALS AND LINDSEY AND D.J. BUILT THE BLOG.

IT'S YOUR CHRISTMAS BONUS. OPEN IT. WHAT IS THIS? YOU DIDN'T -- IT'S THE LEASE TO YOUR NEW CAFe ON SUMMIT STREET. WE ALSO THOUGHT THE WEBSITE WOULD BE THE PERFECT WAY TO PROMOTE YOUR NEW CAFe.
