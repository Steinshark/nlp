NARRATOR: I'VE BEEN AN ARCHITECTURE CRITIC IN LOS ANGELES FOR NEARLY 15 YEARS, AND IN ALL THAT TIME I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER COME ACROSS A BUILDING QUITE AS INSCRUTABLE, THIS ONE. IT'S THE ALICE MILLARD HOUSE BY FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT, IN PASADENA. ONE OF 5 REMARKABLE HOUSES WRIGHT DESIGNED AND BUILT IN EARLY 1920S. MY CURIOSITY ABOUT THE HOUSE DEEPENED WHEN ITS OWNER ASKED ME A FEW YEARS AGO IF I WANTED TO SEE THE INSIDE. EMPTY, SAID THE OWNER, A MAN WHO COLLECTED FAMOUS HOUSES THE WAY OTHER PEOPLE COLLECT PICASSOS OR DIEBENKORNS. I COULD EVEN SPEND THE NIGHT, IF I WANTED; HE'D JUST LEND ME THE KEY. IT WAS THRILLING, AND A BIT EERIE, TO SPEND 24 HOURS ALONE IN THAT HOUSE. ANYTHING IS HOW MUCH OF A OUT, WITH ITS ROWS OF PRE-COLUMBIAN ORNAMENT, EVEN HOW CRYPT-LIKE. I MEAN, LOOK AT THE PLACE. WELCOMING, OR ESPECIALLY DOMESTIC IN ANY TYPICAL SENSE OF THAT WORD. IT'S SOMETHING ELSE: OPAQUE AND TOUGH TO READ, TIGHT-LIPPED. I STARTED TO WONDER: WHY DOES THE HOUSE LOOK THIS WAY? WHY DID L.A. ELICIT THIS KIND I REMEMBERED A LINE BY BRENDAN GILL, ONE OF THE ARCHITECT'S WHO WROTE THAT WRIGHT'S L.A. HOUSES ARE &quot;BETTER SUITED TO SHELTERING A MAYAN GOD THAN AN WAS HE RIGHT ABOUT THAT? WHAT WAS IT ABOUT PRE-COLUMBIAN ARCHITECTURE SPECIFICALLY THAT IN THOSE YEARS? WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE IS THE STORY OF MY ATTEMPT TO FIND AS IT TURNS OUT, THE ANSWERS MAKE UP A STORY MORE FASCINATING, AND MORE COMPLICATED, THAN I EVER WOULD HAVE GUESSED. A STORY THAT EVEN A NOVELIST AND OVERSTUFFED; ONE INVOLVING A MID-LIFE CRISIS OF EPIC AND A BRUTAL MASS MURDER. A STORY STARRING AN ARCHITECT AS SO MANY OTHER AMERICANS HAVE DONE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, A PLACE WRIGHT WOULD LATER DESCRIBE AS &quot;THAT FAR CORNER OF THE UNITED STATES.&quot; THE FIRST THING TO DO, IN LEARNING EXACTLY HOW FRANK SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, SEEMED OBVIOUS: I HAD TO GO BACK TO THE BEGINNING, TO OAK PARK, THE WHERE WRIGHT OPENED AN OFFICE ACCLAIMED ARCHITECT LOUIS SULLIVAN. WRIGHT AND HIS WIFE CATHERINE, KNOWN AS KITTY, WOULD SOON HAVE I ALSO HOPED TO SIT DOWN WITH SOME EXPERTS ON WRIGHT'S WORK FROM THAT PERIOD. ARCHITECTURE CRITIC. BLAIR KAMIN: IT'S FASCINATING HE BEGINS WITH A SHINGLE STYLE HOUSE, THE HOME AND STUDIO IN KIND OF LABORATORY, A WAY TO HAWTHORNE: WRIGHT'S HOME AND STUDIO, FEATURING A PLAYROOM GROWING FAMILY, WAS REALLY A DECLARATION OF WAR ON TRADITIONAL, HIDEBOUND IN THE DESIGNS THAT FOLLOWED, WRIGHT PRODUCED A MARKEDLY NEW KIND OF HOUSE--THE PRAIRIE GROUND, WITH A HORIZONTAL MOMENTUM PERFECTLY SUITED TO IN A SERIES OF HOUSES JUST AFTER 1900, WRIGHT BROUGHT THIS PERFECTION. KAMIN: YOU SEE THAT CULMINATE, THIS KIND OF GREAT STATEMENT WHICH IS, YOU KNOW, SEEMINGLY THE MIDWEST AND FLYING FORWARD, LIKE A SHIP, WITH ITS CANTILEVERED ROOFS. A HOUSE THAT SEEMS BOTH ROOTED AND STATIC BUT ALSO INCREDIBLY HAWTHORNE: MY NEXT STOP WAS TO TALK WITH A FORMER ARCHITECTURE AT CHICAGO'S DUSABLE MUSEUM OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN HISTORY. INTERESTING BREAK IN HIS CAREER PARTICULARLY THE LAST FEW YEARS, HE'S REALLY HAD AN HAWTHORNE: IN THESE YEARS, WRIGHT WAS BEGINNING TO MOVE BEYOND RESIDENTIAL ARCHITECTURE BEY: IF HIS CAREER WERE TO STOP THERE, HE'D BE A LEGEND, BUT AS WE KNOW, IT GOES ON BEYOND THAT. HAWTHORNE: DESPITE THIS PROFESSIONAL SUCCESS, WRIGHT BEGAN TO FEEL STIFLED IN OAK HE WAS REACHING MIDDLE AGE. STYLE JUST ABOUT AS FAR AS IT WOULD GO. PRAIRIE HOUSES, JUST A HALF-MILE FROM HIS OWN, WAS DESIGNED FOR A COUPLE NAMED EDWIN AND MAMAH CHENEY. INTELLECTUAL, A TRANSLATOR, AND A FEMINIST. A WOMAN WHO COULD MORE THAN HOLD HER OWN IN DEBATES WITH WRIGHT. BEGAN SOCIALIZING WITH THE CHENEYS, AND BEFORE LONG, ACCORDING TO TIM SAMUELSON, CHICAGO'S CULTURAL HISTORIAN, PEOPLE SAMUELSON: THERE WERE CERTAINLY WHISPERS ABOUT THE IDEA OF A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT AND MAMAH IT'S NOT UNUSUAL FOR THINGS WAS A PRETTY UNCONVENTIONAL FIGURE. DIFFERENTLY, AND SO, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD CATCH PEOPLE'S CURIOSITY. HAWTHORNE: WRIGHT'S RELATIONSHIP WITH MAMAH CHENEY SEEMED TO GIVE HIM A NEW TASTE FOR SAMUELSON: THIS IS SOMEBODY WHO CHALLENGED WRIGHT, WHO COULD BE WHO I THINK YOU CAN SAY, IN ALL CONFIDENCE, WAS THE LOVE OF HAWTHORNE: IN THE FALL OF 1909, WRIGHT ABRUPTLY SHUTTERED HIS OFFICE, LEFT HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN BEHIND, AND SAILED TO SAMUELSON: ONCE HE LEAVES, THEN THE JOURNALISTS TAKE OVER. IT BECOMES SENSATIONALISTIC. KAMIN: WRIGHT IS A TABLOID MEAN, HE'S RIGHT OUT OF CENTRAL CASTING IN TERMS OF HOW HE LOOKS, HIS BRAGGADOCIO. HE'S A GUY WHO MANIPULATES THE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE MEDIA. THE MEDIA HELPS MAKE HIM AND IT ALSO HELPS TEAR HIM APART. HAWTHORNE: FRANK AND MAMAH SETTLED IN ITALY'S TUSCAN WRIGHT ALSO TRAVELED WIDELY, SEEING THE NEWEST LANDMARKS OF EUROPEAN MODERNISM, AND SPENT SIGNIFICANT TIME IN BERLIN. SAMUELSON: HE IS ENGAGED TO PUBLICATION OF HIS WORK IN EUROPE FOR THE GREAT GERMAN PUBLISHING HOUSE OF WASMUTH. STUNNING PROFESSIONAL GROWTH AS WELL. HE COMES BACK TO AMERICA A DIFFERENT ARCHITECT THAN HE DID HAWTHORNE: ON HIS RETURN IN 1910, WRIGHT TRIED TO REESTABLISH HIS ARCHITECTURAL SOON BECAME CLEAR THAT THE WHILE HE WAS AWAY. WHEN I SAT DOWN INSIDE THE ROBIE HOUSE WITH THE CHICAGO ARCHITECT ARIC LASHER, HE TOLD ME THAT WRIGHT HAD OTHER PRIORITIES THAN QUIETING THE LASHER: HE WAS SOMEONE DRIVEN BY ARTISTIC IMPULSES ABOVE ALL OBVIOUSLY, SOCIAL PROPRIETY AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS WERE LESS IMPORTANT THAN HIS MISSION AS AN ARTIST AND AS A CREATIVE THINKER. HAWTHORNE: THAT MAY SOUND IN THE ABSTRACT LIKE BOILERPLATE PRAISE, THE KIND OF THING YOU'D HEAR FROM A TOUR GUIDE, BUT I WHAT I WAS BEGINNING TO LEARN WAS THAT WRIGHT, WHEN FACED WITH A CHOICE BETWEEN PRODUCING ARCHITECTURE THAT HE KNEW WAS POPULAR AND ARCHITECTURE THAT MIGHT PUSH HIS WORK IN NEW DIRECTIONS, ALMOST ALWAYS TOOK IT WAS A KIND OF COMPULSION FOR HIM, THIS INSTINCT. AS ONE WRITER PUT IT, &quot;WRIGHT SEEMED UNCOMFORTABLE AS SOON AS HIS LIFE REACHED ANY SORT OF AS HE HAD THE YEAR BEFORE, WRIGHT DECIDED HE NEEDED TO GET AWAY. SAMUELSON: HE RETURNS TO WHAT WAS PART OF HIS ROOTS, THE FAMILY LAND OF THE LLOYD JONESES. THIS WOULD BE HIS MOTHER'S FAMILY. HAWTHORNE: AS A REFUGE FOR A REMARKABLY AMBITIOUS HOUSE THE MATERIALS HE FOUND ON THE SITE OR CLOSE BY, WITH SAND TO MAKE STUCCO THE SAME OCHER COLOR AS THE RIVER'S BANKS. BEY: AND IN A SENSE, HE'S HOME, RIGHT? HE'S WELSH BY EXTRACTION AND HE BROW,&quot; A WELSH WORD. SO, IT'S HIM RETURNING TO SOMETHING, AND SOMETHING DEEPER HAWTHORNE: WALKING THROUGH TALIESIN, I WAS REMINDED THAT IT'S WITHOUT ANY DOUBT ONE OF THE SUPREME ACHIEVEMENTS OF IT WAS SYMBOLIC FOR HIM OF TWO THINGS: HIS BREAK WITH CONVENTIONAL SOCIETY IN OAK CREATING AN ARCHITECTURE THAT THE LANDSCAPE BUT TO BE ALMOST BUT WRIGHT DIDN'T CUT TIES WITH CHICAGO ALTOGETHER. CHICAGO OFFICE WHERE HE COULD MEET CLIENTS, AND THERE WERE SOME BIG PROJECTS. SOME WERE DREAM PROJECTS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE MIDWAY GARDENS IN CHICAGO, WHICH WAS LIKE MADE SOMETHING THAT WAS MADE TO APPEAL TO ALL THE SENSES. HAWTHORNE: IT WAS WHILE WRIGHT WAS WORKING AT THE MIDWAY GARDENS SITE ONE AFTERNOON IN AUGUST OF 1914 THAT HE RADICALLY CHANGE HIS LIFE. AN UNFOLDING TRAGEDY AT TOTALLY UNIMAGINABLE. A SERVANT UP AT TALIESIN HAD THE STAFF, BUT MURDERED BRUTALLY THE LOVE AND PASSION CHENEY. COOK AND HANDYMAN NAMED JULIAN HIS MOTIVE REMAINS UNCLEAR, ALTHOUGH HIS WIFE TOLD POLICE PARANOID IN THE WEEKS BEFORE THE CRIME. AFTER SERVING LUNCH TO MAMAH AND HER TWO CHILDREN, HE ATTACKED AND WITH A HATCHET. THEN HE LIT THE TALIESIN STUDIO ON FIRE AND KILLED SEVERAL MEMBERS OF WRIGHT'S STAFF IN THE SAME GRUESOME FASHION. WITH TO THIS DAY, THE LARGEST MASS MURDER IN WISCONSIN HISTORY. JUST DOWN THE HILL FROM TALIESIN, I VISITED THE GROUNDS BURIED MAMAH IN A PLAIN PINE COFFIN. THIS WAS AN INTENSELY PERSONAL SPOT FOR WRIGHT: THE CHAPEL ITSELF WAS THE FIRST BUILDING HE EVER HELPED DESIGN, AS A TEENAGER, AND HIS MOTHER'S FAMILY, THE LLOYD JONESES, ALL WORSHIPPED BURIED THERE. IT TOOK ME A WHILE UNLIKE THOSE OF WRIGHT'S BLOOD RELATIVES, WHICH ARE AWAY AT THE BASE OF A TREE. IN DESPAIR AFTER THE MURDERS, BOILS AND THOUGHT HE WAS GOING BLIND. ULTIMATELY, THOUGH, MAMAH'S DEATH WOULD LEAVE A MARK FAR MORE PSYCHOLOGICAL THAN PHYSICAL. OF TALIESIN, HE BEGAN TO SEE HIMSELF. &quot;THE GAPING BLACK HOLE LEFT BY FIRE IN THE BEAUTIFUL HILLSIDE,&quot; HE WROTE, &quot;WAS NO IN MY OWN LIFE.&quot; IT WAS IN THAT SHAKY STATE OF MIND THAT WRIGHT MADE HIS FIRST TRIP TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, IN MONTHS AFTER THE MURDERS. BACK IN LOS ANGELES, I SAT DOWN WITH DEVERELL TO ASK HIM WHAT KIND OF CITY WRIGHT FOUND HERE. DEVERELL: LOS ANGELES COMES OUT SO, THE POPULATION GROWTH IN PRODIGIOUS, FROM THE FIRST 3 DECADES OF THE 20TH CENTURY. HAWTHORNE: THE L.A. OF THAT ERA WAS ALMOST PERFECTLY SUITED TO DISTRACTING PROSPECT OF NEW WORK AND NEW CLIENTS. DEVERELL: SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, SINCE THE ERA OF THE GOLD RUSH BEEN SEEN AS A PLACE FOR REINVENTION. FEEL TO IT. TO IT. LATE 19TH AND EARLY 20TH GET BETTER, THEY WANT TO GET WELL, THEY WANT TO CONVALESCE. IMPORTANT STOPS ON THAT TRIP TO PANAMA-CALIFORNIA EXPOSITION IN SAN DIEGO. THERE RICH VARIETY OF BUILDING MODELS PRE-COLUMBIAN DESIGNS, ARTIFACTS OF THE MAYA, AND OTHER CULTURES THAT ROSE TO YEARS AGO, IN THE CENTURIES SPANISH. ACCORDING TO MEGAN O'NEIL AND JESSE LERNER, THE EXPERTS IN WITH NEXT, THE SAN DIEGO EXPO CELEBRATED MAYA DESIGNS AS PART INDIGENOUS TO THE AMERICAS. O'NEIL: THE 1915 EXPOSITION IN SAN DIEGO, THE EXTERIOR OF THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING WAS SPANISH WAS THIS SORT OF MAYA FANTASY WORLD, LET'S SAY, THAT WAS PARTIALLY VERY ARCHAEOLOGICAL, I THINK, BUT THEN ALSO ABOUT THIS FANTASY IMAGINATION OF LERNER: ALL THE VISITORS TO THE HAD A CHANCE TO SEE VERY SCULPTURE AND SOME MORE FANCIFUL REPRESENTATIONS OF MAYA CITIES AT THEIR PRIME. HAWTHORNE: IN ADDITION, THE WRIGHT'S MIND A LINK BETWEEN THIS ARCHITECTURE AND DEATH. PRE-COLUMBIAN TEMPLES WERE SOMETIMES NOT ONLY THE SETTINGS PART OF COMPLEXES WHERE IMPORTANT FIGURES WERE BURIED. COMMUNE WITH AND REMEMBER THE DEAD. SAMUELSON: WITH WRIGHT'S MIND, HE TAKES IT ALL IN. IT BECOMES PART OF HIS TOOLBOX HAWTHORNE: WRIGHT HAD SEEN PRE-COLUMBIAN ARCHITECTURE BEFORE. WORLD'S COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION IN ACCORDING TO THE UCLA HINES, THERE WERE ALSO MEMORIES FROM HIS CHILDHOOD. HAD GIVEN HIM BOOKS WITH CENTRAL AMERICA, MEXICO, AND THE YUCATAN. THOSE IMAGES STAYED IN HIS MIND MOST OF HIS LIFE. 4 BOOKS, A SERIES OF TWO VOLUMES CALLED &quot;INCIDENTS OF &quot;INCIDENTS OF TRAVEL IN CENTRAL AMERICA, CHIAPAS, AND YUCATAN,&quot; THAT WERE VERY SUCCESSFUL. THEY WENT THROUGH MANY REPRINTINGS AND THEY ARE REALLY AWARENESS OF THE RUINS OF THE THE AUTHOR OF THESE 4 BOOKS IS JOHN LLOYD STEPHENS, AND HE WITH A PHOTOGRAPHER AND CATHERWOOD. SHORTLY AFTER THE PUBLICATION TO SEE ALL KINDS OF REFERENCES TO THE ANCIENT MAYA AND TO HAWTHORNE: THOSE REFERENCES INCLUDED THIS PAIR OF SIBLINGS THAT P.T. BARNUM PUT IN HIS FREAK SHOWS, THOUGH HE CALLED THEM AZTEC, NOT MAYAN. AND, INCREDIBLY, THESE FLOATS, AT LEAST ONE WITH A FAKE DEAD BODY DRAPED ACROSS IT, DESIGNED THEY WERE PART OF THE LA FIESTA STREETS OF L.A. SO, LET'S PAUSE HERE TO CONSIDER THE EVIDENCE WE'VE COLLECTED SO DIRECTION OF WRIGHT'S WORK AFTER THE MURDERS AT TALIESIN. WRIGHT'S INTEREST IN PRE-COLUMBIAN ARCHITECTURE, THE ARCHITECTURE, AND THE MURDER OF MAMAH BORTHWICK? YOU GET THIS, ONE OF THE FIRST AFTER RETURNING TO THE MIDWEST FROM HIS TRIP TO CALIFORNIA. IT'S A WAREHOUSE COMMISSIONED GERMAN FOR A SITE IN WRIGHT'S BIRTHPLACE, THE SLEEPY CENTER. I GOT A TOUR FROM A COUPLE OF LOCAL RESIDENTS WHO ARE WORKING TO BRING THE BUILDING BACK TO IT DOES NOT LOOK OR A FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT DESIGN, OR THE KIND OF BUILDING YOU'D WISCONSIN. IT LOOKS A TEMPLE, LIKE SOMETHING STRAIGHT OUT OF A CATHERWOOD DRAWING. LERNER: IF YOU PUT THAT SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE SO-CALLED NUNNERY BUILDINGS THAT HE WOULD HAVE SEEN REPRODUCED BOTH AT THE CHICAGO COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION AND PHOTOGRAPHS OF IN SAN DIEGO, YOU CAN SEE A REAL SORT OF DIALOGUE AT THE VERY LEAST. HAWTHORNE: IT'S CLEAR THAT CENTER COMMISSION TO TEST OUT THE MAYAN AND OTHER PRE-COLUMBIAN MOTIFS THAT HE'D WOULD SOON FORM THE BASIS OF HIS RESIDENTIAL WORK IN LOS ANGELES. AND THOUGH HE WAS IN A NEW RELATIONSHIP BY NOW, A TEMPESTUOUS ONE, WITH A WOMAN NAMED MIRIAM NOEL, WHOM HE QUICKLY DIVORCE, HE WAS ALSO STILL STRUGGLING TO RECOVER EMOTIONALLY FROM THE MURDERS, AND INCREASINGLY DESPERATE TO WORK ANYWHERE BUT THE MIDWEST. LUCKILY FOR WRIGHT, HE FOUND TWO COMMISSIONS THAT HELPED HIM ACCELERATE HIS ESCAPE. HE WAS ASKED TO DESIGN THE GIANT IMPERIAL HOTEL IN TOKYO, AND A PROJECT THAT WOULD ULTIMATELY BE DUBBED HOLLYHOCK HOUSE, FOR INCONSTANT NEW CLIENT NAMED HINES: WRIGHT WAS IN NEED OF ESCAPE AND HELP. THE IMPERIAL HOTEL COMMISSION, AND HERE IN THE BARNSDALL THOSE TWO GREAT, RATHER EXOTIC COMMISSIONS IN EXOTIC PLACES AND THOSE WERE IMPORTANT SOURCES OF HEALING, REALLY, FOR HIM. HAWTHORNE: ACCORDING TO JEFFREY HERR, WHO NOW OVERSEES HOLLYHOCK HOUSE, ALINE JUST A RESIDENCE BUT A PERFORMING-ARTS COMPLEX. EUROPE AND BECAME INTERESTED AVANT-GARDE THEATRE. HAWTHORNE: WHILE WRIGHT WAS OFF IN TOKYO, SHE FOUND A 36-ACRE HILLTOP SITE ON THE EASTERN EDGE OF HOLLYWOOD, A SPOT HINES: WITH ALINE BARNSDALL'S FROM HER FATHER WHO HAD BEEN AN OIL BARON, THERE WERE LIMITLESS POSSIBILITIES. HAWTHORNE: AND WHILE HER DREAMS OF BUILDING A THEATER WERE NEVER REALIZED, THE HOUSE WRIGHT PRODUCED FOR HER IS PLENTY THEATRICAL ON ITS OWN. HERR: WHEN WRIGHT DESIGNED HOLLYHOCK HOUSE, HE NOT ONLY CONCEDED TO ALINE BARNSDALL'S NAMED HOLLYHOCK HOUSE BECAUSE HE WENT 10 STEPS FURTHER DESIGNING AN AMAZING ABSTRACTION OF THE PLANT AND THEN RIFFING ON THAT WITH OF THAT DESIGN. HAWTHORNE: THERE IS A RANGE OF STYLES IN HOLLYHOCK HOUSE, INCLUDING VIENNESE MODERN AND JAPANESE ARCHITECTURE. TEMPLE. HERR: IF YOU LOOK AT THE WEST FACADE, YOU HAVE THIS MONUMENTAL SORT OF TEMPLE-STYLE BUILDING. IT HAS ORNAMENTATION THAT IS OR PRE-COLUMBIAN RUINS. HAWTHORNE: IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS, DESPITE ITS REAL BRILLIANCE, HOLLYHOCK HOUSE WAS AN IMPERFECT L.A. DEBUT FOR WRIGHT. FULFILLING BARNSDALL'S AMBITIONS, THAT'S FOR SURE. WRIGHT'S L.A. HOUSES TO COME, IT NEVER SUCCEEDED AS A RESIDENCE, A STARTED THINKING ABOUT DONATING IT TO THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES AND SHE WOULD MAKE THE GIFT OFFICIAL IN 1927. IT'S PROBABLY DIFFICULT FOR US TO REALIZE NOW JUST HOW IDIOSYNCRATIC A HOUSE DESIGNED HAVE SEEMED IN THE LOS ANGELES OF THAT TIME. DEVERELL: BY THE TEENS, AND ELITE ARCHITECTURAL CLIENTS HAVE MORE OR LESS CHOSEN THAT SPANISH COLONIAL STYLE. HAWTHORNE: WRIGHT WAS FULL OF DISDAIN FOR THIS ARCHITECTURE ANGELES. HE CALLED IT &quot;FRAUDULENT&quot; AND COMPLAINED THAT THE RED TILE MISSION-STYLE BUILDINGS HERE &quot;GIVE BACK THE SUNSHINE STAINED PINK.&quot; WHEN I WENT TO SEE AUTHORITIES IN L.A. ON WRIGHT'S WORK, SHE EXPLAINED WRIGHT'S DISLIKE FOR THE SPANISH COLONIAL WAS PART OF HIS BROADER IMPATIENCE WITH THE IDEA THAT AMERICAN ARCHITECTS CULTURAL INSPIRATION. SMITH: FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT ORIGINAL AMERICAN ARCHITECTURE. SO, EVEN FROM THE 1890S TO THE ARCHITECTURE, GREEK ROMANESQUE REVIVAL. HINES: WRIGHT WAS ALWAYS NATIONALIST DETERMINED TO FIND THE ROOTS OF AN AMERICAN CULTURE. IN EFFECT, THAT PRE-COLUMBIAN ARCHITECTURE WAS MORE AMERICAN THAN THE SPANISH COLONIAL AND COMMON IN TERMS OF CLIMATE, LANDSCAPE, AND CULTURE WITH PRE-COLUMBIAN MEXICO THAN WITH POINT OF VIEW WAS IN CERTAIN WAYS DEEPLY NAIVE. WRIGHT NEVER VISITED ANY PRE-COLUMBIAN RUINS IN PERSON. AS HE WOULD LATER DO WITH NATIVE AMERICAN DESIGNS, WRIGHT TENDED TO RATHER MAYA CULTURE WITH AZTEC OR INCA. LASHER: THERE IS SOMETHING PECULIAR ABOUT LOOKING TO INDIGENOUS ARCHITECTURES OF NORTH AND CENTRAL AMERICA AND FACT, YOU'RE THE DESCENDANT OF, YOU KNOW, WHITE SETTLERS THAT ACTUALLY PUSHED THESE INDIGENOUS CULTURES ASIDE. HAWTHORNE: AND YET THERE WAS ALSO SOMETHING GENUINE IN WRIGHT'S USE OF PRE-COLUMBIAN FORMS. WHAT HE WAS EXPRESSING WAS A KIND OF HEARTFELT, IF &quot;WE CAN'T LEARN ANYTHING FROM EUROPE,&quot; HE SAID. &quot;THEY HAVE TO BY EARLY 1923, DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE BARNSDALL JOB HADN'T WRIGHT DECIDED HE WANTED TO SETTLE IN LOS ANGELES FOR GOOD. HIS SON FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT JR., KNOWN AS LLOYD WRIGHT AND AN PRECEDED HIM TO L.A. FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT FOUND A STUDIO AT THE CORNER OF FOUNTAIN AND HARPER AVENUES, IN SMITH: FORTUNATELY FOR HIM, THERE WAS SOMEONE HERE WHO KNEW HIM, AND THIS WAS A WOMAN NAMED ALICE MILLARD. COMMISSIONED HIM FOR A HOUSE IN CHICAGO. HAWTHORNE: MILLARD HAD MOVED TO CALIFORNIA AFTER HER HUSBAND A HOUSE FOR A PIECE OF LAND SHE'D FOUND IN PASADENA. IT WAS A COMMISSION THAT WOULD NEW DIRECTION. WRIGHT WANTED TO OFFER AN ANSWER TO THE LEAN, MACHINE-MADE TRACTION IN EUROPE, BUT HE WANTED TO DO IT IN A WAY INDIGENOUS TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BUT THAT MIGHT BE DEMOCRATIC, AFFORDABLE ON A WRIGHT DEVISED A BRAND-NEW MODULAR SYSTEM MADE, SURPRISINGLY ENOUGH, OF RECIPE THAT USED SOIL FROM THE BUILDING SITE ITSELF. CONCRETE BLOCKS THAT COULD BE STACKED QUICKLY BY HAND. WHICH IS A NATURAL MATERIAL ITS MATERIALS ARE PART OF THE EARTH, BOUND TOGETHER BY THE GRANITES THAT ARE PUT TOGETHER FORMED. APPEALED TO WRIGHT BECAUSE HE COULD EASILY STAMP THE BLOCKS WITH THE MAYA PATTERNS HE'D GROWN SO FOND OF. THE MATERIAL OF THE HOUSE AND WOULD BE ONE AND THE SAME. PERHAPS THINKING BACK TO TALIESIN, WRIGHT TOLD ALICE MILLARD THAT ONE VIRTUE OF THE BLOCKS WAS THAT THEY WERE FIREPROOF. WHEN OSMAN, AN EXPERT IN THE MATERIALS OF MODERN THERE WERE SOME BASIC CONTRADICTIONS INHERENT IN WRIGHT'S NEW SYSTEM. OSMAN: WHEN I THINK ABOUT IS DOING WHEN THEY TRY AND MAKE A MODULAR SYSTEM OUT OF CONCRETE, IT SEEMS TO ME TO BE AGAINST THE GRAIN OF THAT MATERIAL, WHICH IN A CERTAIN WAY LENDS ITSELF TO BEING MORE OF A MASS AND LESS OF A UNIT. SO, WITH WOOD, BECAUSE IT GROWS IN A YOU'RE ALREADY GIVEN A UNIT, INVESTIGATION INTO WHAT THE LOG CAN DELIVER IN TERMS OF LUMBER. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO AN AGGREGATE MADE UP OF SAND, CEMENT, GRAVEL, AND FRANKENSTEIN BODY IN A WAY, SO, OF COUNTERINTUITIVE THING, EVEN THOUGH PEOPLE NOW, WE TAKE IT IN MODULAR UNITS. HAWTHORNE: CONCRETE WAS FAR FROM A HIGH-DESIGN MATERIAL IN &quot;CHEAPEST AND UGLIEST THING IN THE BUILDING WORLD.&quot; AND, IN FACT, THIS WAS PART OF AS HE PUT IT, &quot;WHY NOT SEE WHAT COULD BE DONE WITH THAT GUTTER OSMAN: CONCRETE WAS A GUTTER SURE WITH JOHN RUSKIN IN THE SEVEN LAMPS OF ARCHITECTURE, USE--THERE'S A FOOTNOTE: NEVER USE CONCRETE BECAUSE IT HAS NO CHARACTER. IT DOESN'T COME FROM NATURE, THE CHARACTER OF EITHER WHAT YOU COVER IT WITH, OR THE FORMWORK THAT IT'S POURED INTO. QUALITY WAS CENTRAL TO CONCRETE'S APPEAL. SHAPESHIFTER, CAPABLE OF SOLVING SEVERAL ARCHITECTURAL PROBLEMS AT ONCE. SMITH: SO, WITH THIS ONE ELEMENT, THE SQUARE BLOCK, FRANK THAT WAS STRUCTURAL, MODULAR, MATERIAL, AND A POETIC HAWTHORNE: ONCE WRIGHT HAD AN MILLARD'S PROPERTY, HE DECIDED TO PUT THE HOUSE NOT IN THE PERFECTLY FLAT MIDDLE OF THE LOT, AS PRETTY MUCH ANY OTHER DOWN IN A RAVINE ALONG ONE EDGE. THOUGH THIS MADE THE HOUSE SUSCEPTIBLE TO FLOODING FROM DAY ONE, IT'S ALSO WHAT GIVES THE DESIGN, VEILED BY TREES, SUCH AN THE RESULT, WHICH WRIGHT NICKNAMED &quot;LA MINIATURA,&quot; IS A SINGULARLY ARCHITECTURE, ONE THAT SEEMS TO SITE WHILE ALSO CLOSING ITSELF OFF FROM THE WORLD AT LARGE. FLAT-ROOFED LIKE A WORK OF A EUROPEAN MODERNIST, BUT ALTOGETHER MORE MYSTERIOUS, A SMALL TEMPLE IN A EUCALYPTUS GROVE. REMEMBER BRENDAN GILL'S MAYAN GOD? HE MIGHT HAVE FELT VERY MUCH AT O'NEIL: WHEN I SAW THE DESIGNS CROSS, I THOUGHT, &quot;WELL, COULD MESOAMERICAN UNDERSTANDING OF THE SHAPE OF THE UNIVERSE?&quot; WHICH THE MAYA WERE A PART, MIXTECS, ZAPOTECS, ALL THESE DIRECTIONS AND INTERCARDINAL DIRECTIONS WERE ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT TO ESTABLISHING THE UNIVERSE. HEROES WHO MEASURE OUT THE SIDES OF THE UNIVERSE. SO, WHEN YOU SEE THIS CROSS, LET'S SAY, EQUIDISTANT, IT IS SHOWING, IT'S POINTING TO THOSE CARDINAL DIRECTIONS, SHAPE OF YOUR UNIVERSE. BUT THAT SPECIFIC DESIGN IS THE AZTECS. LLOYD WRIGHT KNEW THAT, BUT IT'S PRETTY NEAT TO SEE THE DESIGNS FOR GOLD. IT'S SORT OF THIS SORT OF GET CONCRETE TURNING INTO GOLD, SO, SORT OF TRANSUBSTANTIATION OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. HAWTHORNE: BY THIS POINT, I'D SPOKEN TO A NUMBER OF EXPERTS ON WRIGHT'S WORK, BOTH IN THE MIDWEST AND IN LOS ANGELES. WHAT I HADN'T DONE IS SPEAK TO THESE HOUSES. AND WHILE THAT WAS IMPOSSIBLE IN A L.A. HOUSES IS NOW USED AS A FULL-TIME RESIDENCE--I FOUND 8-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER. [PIANO PLAYING] WOMAN: BEAUTIFUL. HAWTHORNE: SHE TAKES PIANO TO THE MILLARD HOUSE, WHICH WRIGHT'S SON LLOYD ADDED IN 1926. HER TEACHER, CINDY LAM, ACTS AS LAM: TWO. NOTES WERE CORRECT. I DID THINK IT WAS STRANGE-LOOKING. WHEN I FIRST SAW PICTURES OF THIS PLACE, I THOUGHT, &quot;REALLY? LIKE, WHO MAKES A CONCRETE HOUSE? THAT'S JUST, LIKE, SO UGLY. WHO DOES THAT?&quot; [LAUGHS] I DIDN'T REALLY SEE THE DARKNESS. I THINK REPRESENTED STRENGTH AND BEAUTY I HAD A BREAK-UP WITH A BOYFRIEND AND WE WERE IN THE PROCESS OF BREAKING UP AND HE WAS SAYING ALL THESE THINGS TO ME THAT WERE, YOU KNOW, LESS THAN DESIRABLE. I JUST REMEMBER THERE WAS LIKE WENT OFF AND I THOUGHT, &quot;THIS IS MY FORTRESS. YOU DON'T GET TO BE IN HERE. YOU NEED TO LEAVE NOW.&quot; THIS HOUSE REALLY EMBOLDENS PEOPLE. I'VE FOUND PEOPLE IN THE YARD. SAYS THAT THERE ARE NO TOURS BUT IF YOU FEEL ENTITLED TO ONE THEN YOU CAN LEAVE A BOTTLE OF [LAUGHS] SO FAR, NO WINE. I THINK PEOPLE GET A LITTLE BIT SHAMED BY THAT WAY. HAWTHORNE: THE NEXT HOUSE WRIGHT DESIGNED IN LOS ANGELES, AFTER MILLARD, HAS ALWAYS BEEN SOMETHING OF AN ENIGMA. AND SO IS THE MAN IT'S NAMED FOR, A DOCTOR FROM WISCONSIN SMITH: WE DON'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT HIS BIOGRAPHY, BUT THROUGH THE DRAWINGS AND SOME CORRESPONDENCE, IT HAS COME TO LIGHT THAT THIS WAS PROBABLY A STORER WAS BUILDING FOR RESALE. HAWTHORNE: THOUGH THE CURRENT TO FILM THERE, MARTHA STEWART, WHO FEATURED THE HOUSE ON HER TELEVISION FOOTAGE SUGGESTS A GOOD DEAL OF CONTINUITY WITH THE MILLARD HOUSE, WITH A STRONG MAYA BLOCKS, A REDWOOD CEILING, AND A RATHER STANDOFFISH RELATIONSHIP TO THE STREET. HINES: YOU LOOK UP AT IT FROM HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD, THAT LITTLE STRETCH OF HOLLYWOOD PRESENCE THERE. IT DOES NOT NESTLE IN. ROOM ON THE TOP FLOOR, INSIDE A TALL CENTRAL PAVILION THAT OPENS ONTO A PAIR OF TERRACES. THE HOUSE IS EVEN MORE VERTICAL SEEN FROM THE STREET, BECAUSE INSTEAD OF BEING SUNK INTO A AND GOES UP FROM THERE. THE AUTHOR AND WRIGHT EXPERT ROBERT SWEENEY TOLD ME THAT AS THE CONSTRUCTION, WRIGHT WAS CONTINUING TO EXPERIMENT WITH THE CONCRETE BLOCK SYSTEM. SWEENEY: HE DID A DESIGN FOR ALINE BARNSDALL ON OLIVE HILL WAS A KINDERGARTEN. AND THERE ARE MANY DRAWINGS SHOWING THE EVOLUTION OF THE IT WAS WORKED OUT FOR THE HAWTHORNE: ONE CHANGE FROM COULD BE STACKED WITHOUT ANY LABOR, AND THEN WOVEN TOGETHER STEEL RODS. WRIGHT CALLED IT A TEXTILE BLOCK SYSTEM. SWEENEY: WRIGHT WENT BACK TO WISCONSIN DURING CONSTRUCTION OF THE STORER HOUSE AND TURNED THE PROJECT OVER TO HIS SON LLOYD. CALIFORNIA, WRIGHT WAS DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED. COMPARED TO ALICE MILLARD, STORER WAS A LESS INVOLVED AND ON TOP OF THAT, WRIGHT'S BLOCK SYSTEM WAS PROVING TRICKY TO EXECUTE, ESPECIALLY ON A WRIGHT TOLD LLOYD THAT HE CONSIDERED THE HOUSE A &quot;TRAGEDY&quot; AND THAT IT WAS &quot;LACKING JOY.&quot; THE HOUSE, EVEN IN PRAISING IT, COMPARED THE LIVING ROOM TO &quot;A WRIGHT'S OWN FAMILY STRIFE AND VIOLENT RECENT PAST WERE BLOCKS THEMSELVES. THE HOUSE, TO BE FAIR, HASN'T ALWAYS PROMPTED THAT SORT OF IN THE 1980S, THE FILM PRODUCER JOEL SILVER BOUGHT IT AND UNDERTOOK A COMPLETE AND IN THE PROCESS, HE BECAME SO BEGAN DROPPING REFERENCES TO THE ARCHITECT INTO HIS WORK. IN &quot;DIE HARD,&quot; THERE'S A TV NEWS STATION CALLED KFLW, AND THE MOVIE'S VILLAIN, HANS GRUBER, PLAYED BY ALAN RICKMAN, PAUSES AT ONE POINT TO ADMIRE A BRIDGE DESIGN THAT WRIGHT IN REAL LIFE PROPOSED NEAR THE END OF HIS GRUBER/RICKMAN: --EXACTNESS, THE ATTENTION TO EVERY CONCEIVABLE DETAIL. IT'S BEAUTIFUL. HAWTHORNE: THE STORER HOUSE ITSELF DOESN'T SHOW UP IN ANY OF SILVER'S MOVIES, OR ANY FAMOUS MOVIES, FOR THAT FOR THE NEXT OF WRIGHT'S LOS ANGELES HOUSES, FOR THE COUPLE CHARLES AND MABEL ENNIS, IT'S A [DOOR CREAKING] [MAN LAUGHING] VINCENT PRICE: I'M VINCENT PARTY IN THE HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL. HAWTHORNE: I VISITED THE COMPLETION OF AN IMMACULATE RESTORATION OVERSEEN BY ITS NEW WHAT STRUCK ME WAS THAT THE BUT THE MOST IMPOSING OF WRIGHT'S L.A. DESIGNS, ONE THAT MANAGES TO CONCRETE BLOCK. LOOMING OVER LOS FELIZ, IT'S VISION OF A PRE-COLUMBIAN TEMPLE RELOCATED TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA--MONUMENTAL AND IMPENETRABLE. HINES: THAT BULWARK, THAT BASTION UP THERE. QUITE WONDERFUL, QUITE STRIKING, BUT NOT INTIMATE. THE WROUGHT-IRON DECORATION AND STAINED GLASS IN PARTICULAR, REFLECT THE ENNISES' TASTE MORE SMITH: THEY WERE AN INTERESTING COUPLE. WE DON'T REALLY KNOW I DON'T THINK IT'S EVEN PINNED DOWN AT THIS MOMENT HOW THEY MET FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT. YEARS WONDERING WHY THEY BUILT IT'S A MAYA PALACE. SMITH: THEY WERE JUST CLIENTS, AND THEY WANTED TO HAVE THE BUILT, AND SO, THERE ARE PARTS OF THE ENNIS HOUSE, MAJOR, MAJOR ELEMENTS THAT POP OUT TO PEOPLE, WHERE THEY TURN TO THE KIND OF DECORATIVE WORK OF THE IT SORT OF LOOKS LIKE NORMA DESMOND'S HOUSE IN &quot;SUNSET BOULEVARD.&quot; AND PEOPLE WONDER ABOUT THAT, TO HAVE IT CARRIED OUT AND COMPLETED TO THEIR OWN WISHES. IT'S ATTRACTED A CERTAIN AURA BEEN MADE MORE SO BY THE NUMBER OF HOLLYWOOD FILMS THAT IT'S BEEN IN. BUT I THINK EVEN BEFORE THAT, IT WAS IN THE HOLLYWOOD FILMS BECAUSE IT COMMUNICATED THIS KIND OF MYSTERIOUS AURA APPIS: OH, MRS. ESTEE DECIDED THE POOL NEEDED A DEAD HORSE IN IT, SO, WE GOT ONE. HAWTHORNE: IF THE ENNIS HOUSE WORK IN SUGGESTING DARK, EVEN SINISTER OVERTONES, IN SEEMING TO REPEL THE VERY IDEA OF EXCEPTION CAME IN THE ARCHITECT'S FOURTH CONCRETE BLOCK HOUSE, IN THE CLIENTS WERE A YOUNG BOHEMIAN COUPLE NAMED HARRIET AND SAMUEL TOGETHER THE MONEY TO BUY A PIECE OF LAND THAT OFFERED A AVENUE. WHAT THE FREEMANS LACKED IN ENTHUSIASM FOR WRIGHT'S WORK. THE ARCHITECT, IN RETURN, FIT THEM LIKE A GLOVE, WITH A BIG, OPEN LIVING ROOM WHERE HARRIET, A DANCER, COULD HOLD THEY LIVED THERE FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES, MORE THAN 60 YEARS. USC, TO WHICH THE FREEMANS DONATED THE HOUSE IN 1986, IT'S BEEN THE SETTING FOR AT LEAST RELATIONSHIP. HARRIS: I'M HANK HARRIS. I'M AN TIMME: IS ELIZABETH TIMME, AND I'M AN ARCHITECT AND SCHOOL OF ARCHITECTURE AT USC FROM 1994 TO 2005 AND-- HARRIS: WE MET AND FELL IN LOVE IN THE FREEMAN HOUSE. BEING ABLE TO STAY THERE WHILE I WAS A STUDENT. HARRIS: ME, TOO. HAWTHORNE: YOU'VE PROBABLY NOTICED BY NOW THAT THE FREEMAN HOUSE IS IN PRETTY TERRIBLE SHAPE. IN AND PERHAPS BECAUSE THE FREEMANS DIDN'T HAVE THE RESOURCES OF THE ENNISES OR HAD STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS FROM THE BEGINNING. WRIGHT HAD CLEARLY NOT PERFECTED HIS NEW CONCRETE BLOCK SYSTEM. THE 1994 NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE. WOULD ABSORB RAIN TO A POINT AND THEN IT WOULD JUST BEGIN TO DRIP THROUGH CONSTANTLY. JUST COMING OVER WITH, LIKE, TARP. PLASTIC EVERYWHERE, JUST TO KEEP THE WATER OFF THE FLOOR, AND WE'D GET UP AND SQUEEGEE IT OFF EVERY MORNING. TIMME: SO, IT FELT LIKE A RUIN, INSIDE SOMETHING THAT FELT VERY MUCH LIKE ANGKOR WAT. IT JUST FELT VERY MUCH LIKE SOMEONE ELSE'S KIND OF BIZARRE &quot;BLADE RUNNER&quot; FANTASY. HAWTHORNE: OUR NEXT INTERVIEWEE, UNDERSTANDS AS WELL AS ANYBODY HOW DIFFICULT THESE PROBLEMS SANDMEIER: WE'RE TAKING THE APPROACH THAT, YOU KNOW, THIS IS AND WE DON'T WANT TO PULL THE WRONG THREAD FIRST AND UNRAVEL IT IS A COMBINATION OF NOT TRYING TO DECIDE WHAT THE RIGHT APPROACH AND, WITH THE SMALL INTERVENTION IS THE MOST IMPORTANT. UP THERE ALL THE TIME, AND IT'S IN A CONDITION WHERE IT ACTUALLY PROVIDES SOME REALLY HOUSE WAS ACTUALLY BUILT. YOU CAN SEE A LOT OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE. YOU CAN SEE THE SYSTEMS. THEY'RE EXPOSED RIGHT THAT'S AMAZING FOR ARCHITECTURE HAWTHORNE: THERE ARE TIMES WHEN IT CAN SEEM LIKE FOLLY TO KEEP WAYS HAS PROVED STUBBORNLY UNFIXABLE. ABOUT THE SYSTEM, BECAUSE IT WAS EXPERIMENTAL, BUT THEN, ON THE THAT IT WAS FLAWED. BELIEVED THAT THE TEXTILE BLOCK SYSTEM SHOULD BE HELD SACROSANCT, BUT IF YOU GO TO JAPAN, YOU SEE, IF YOU FOLLOW OUT THE IDEA OF BUILDING A BUILDING IN CONCERT WITH NATURE, THAT IT HAS A LIFE. WITH A LIFE, AT SOME TIME, A LIFE ENDS. IN SOME WAYS, I KNOW THIS WOULD MENTALITY, BUT PERHAPS THEY SHOULD JUST HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO DETERIORATE, AND THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE LOGICAL CONCLUSION OF THE SYSTEM. TIMME: WE ALWAYS JOKED THAT WE AND FAMOUS, WE WOULD GO GOLD AND THEN BURN IT DOWN. CONCRETE, THOUGH. TIMME: I KNOW. THAT'S WHY IT'S HARRIS: --IT'S A JOKE. TIMME: IT'S A JOKE. WE COULD MELT IT. HARRIS: YEAH. HAWTHORNE: SOME HISTORIANS HAVE STRESSED THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THIS HOUSE AND THE PRECEDED IT, EVEN SEEING IN ITS CASE STUDY MODERN HOUSES OF POST-WAR LOS ANGELES. BUT MORE STRIKING IS HOW SIMILAR AS A GROUP, HOW CONSISTENTLY FREEMAN HOUSE, AS SEEN FROM THE STREET, IS JUST AS WINDOWLESS, SECRETIVE, AND OFF-PUTTING, JUST AS SUGGESTIVE OF A CRYPT, AS THE MILLARD HOUSE, THE FIRST OF WRIGHT'S CONCRETE SMITH: BY THE END OF 1923, HE GOING TO BE A BIG FUTURE FOR HIM. AND HE SORT OF WAS AT A DEAD HERE. HE FELT ALIENATED FROM THE REAL ESTATE MARKET OF LOS ANGELES. HISTORY IS FILLED WITH PEOPLE IMAGINING A FUTURE FOR THEMSELVES THAT NEVER TAKES THEY NEVER GET FAMOUS, THEY NEVER STAR IN A FILM, THEY NEVER FIND OIL, SO, THEY GO HOME. SWEENEY: HE WAS NOT WELL-RECEIVED IN SOUTHERN PEOPLE WERE NOT PEOPLE WILLING TO TAKE THE RISK OR BE EXPERIMENTAL ENOUGH TO BUILD WITH THESE CONCRETE BLOCKS, AND I THINK MANY PEOPLE SIMPLY DIDN'T LIKE THE HOUSES. CONVENTIONAL SENSE. SAMUELSON: HE WAS SOMEBODY WHO WAS IMPULSIVE AND HE WOULD CHANGE. HE WAS PERCEPTIVE. AND SO, IF IT LOOKED LIKE IT WASN'T GOING [SNAPS FINGERS] THAT'S IT. HE WENT BACK HOME. HAWTHORNE: AFTER LEAVING LOS WRIGHT MAINTAINED SOME SON LLOYD STAYED ON IN L.A., AND EVEN CONTINUED THE FAMILY COVERED IN PRE-COLUMBIAN VISITING THIS HOUSE BY LLOYD WRIGHT IS TELLING, THOUGH. WHAT LLOYD PRODUCED HAS NONE OF THE GRAVITY, THE POWER, OF HIS IT FEELS LIKE A STAGE SET, SOME CORNER OF DISNEYLAND. THE HOUSE IS A PASTICHE IN A HOUSES ARE NOT. ACROSS L.A., AS THE 1920S WORE ON, PRE-COLUMBIAN ARCHITECTURE BECAME ALL THE RAGE, THOUGH POPULISM THAN HAD MARKED WRIGHT'S USE OF IT. MOST NOTABLY, A BRITISH STACY-JUDD CAME HERE, FULLY EMBRACED PRE-COLUMBIAN CULTURE, AND NEVER LOOKED BACK. HE BUILT THE AZTEC HOTEL IN MONROVIA. HERE HE IS DOING A MADE-UP PRE-COLUMBIAN COSTUME. SOME OF THAT SAME CHOREOGRAPHY IN FRONT OF THE ENNIS HOUSE IN ON, FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT WOULD STURGES HOUSE IN BRENTWOOD, A CANTILEVERED VERSION OF IN THE 1950S, HE DESIGNED THIS SMALL SHOPPING CENTER ON RODEO DRIVE IN BEVERLY HILLS. BUT HAVE THE PECULIAR FORCE OR DENSITY OF THE L.A. HOUSES OF THE 1920S. CONCRETE BLOCK HOUSES RETAIN CHARACTER. THEY STAND APART FROM THE REST OF THE LOS ANGELES ARCHITECTURE OF THE PERIOD. OSMAN: THE L.A. HOUSES ARE BRUTAL, THEY'RE ROMANTIC, THEY'RE FANTASTIC, YOU KNOW. THEY'RE STRANGE. HAWTHORNE: AND ALL THESE YEARS LATER THEY'VE SETTLED INTO AN POPPING UP NOT JUST IN THE MOVIES BUT IN THE DIGITAL WORLD. WORK EXCEPTIONALLY WELL IN THE GAME MINECRAFT, WHICH RELIES ON THERE'S ALSO A COMPOSITE VERSION OF THE BLOCK HOUSES IN A VIDEO GAME STARRING BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, IN WHICH BUFFY FIGHTS SERIES OF APPROPRIATELY DARK AND MOODY WRIGHTIAN SPACES. TO GET A FINAL AND MORE PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE ON WRIGHT'S TIME IN L.A., I DROVE OUT TO MALIBU ONE WRIGHT, FRANK'S GRANDSON AND LLOYD'S SON, AND AN ARCHITECT IN HIS OWN RIGHT WHO HAS WORKED GRANDFATHER'S HOUSES. ERIC WRIGHT LIVES WITH HIS WIFE MARY IN A COMPOUND OVERLOOKING THE PACIFIC THAT FEELS VERY IF FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT SOUGHT IN L.A. THAT FAR CORNER OF THE SEEMS TO HAVE FOUND THAT FAR WE MET IN AN UNFINISHED BUILDING MADE, APPROPRIATELY ENOUGH, OUT OF CONCRETE ON THE EDGE OF HIS PROPERTY. WE TALKED ABOUT THE TEXTILE BLOCK SYSTEM, HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH WORK ON SOME OF THE L.A. HOUSES. I ASKED HIM WHY HE THOUGHT WRIGHT HAD COME HERE AFTER MAMAH'S MURDER. WHAT HAD DRAWN HIM TO LOS ANGELES? WAS, HAD BEEN VERY UPSET ABOUT THE DEATH OF HIS COMPANION AND HAD COME ABOUT BECAUSE OF HIS LIVING WITH HER AND BEING SO, HE THOUGHT THAT LOS ANGELES, THIS WAS A NEW TOWN, COMING UP, HE COULD HAVE A NEW LIFE. HAWTHORNE: AND THEN, FOR ME, A WRIGHT BEGAN WORKING IN LOS ANGELES, WHAT WAS HIS STATE OF MIND? THINK, SORROW BECAUSE HE HAD, THEY HAD HAD A WONDERFUL LIFE. HE HAD HAD WITH MAMAH BORTHWICK A WONDERFUL LIFE UNTIL HER DEATH. HAWTHORNE: THAT BRINGS US THE MILLARD HOUSE AND THE WHY DO THE L.A. ARE THEY EXPRESSIONS NOT JUST OF A DESIRE FOR PRIVACY AND ERIC WRIGHT'S WORD, OF &quot;SORROW&quot;? SOME OF THE PEOPLE I INTERVIEWED TOOK ISSUE WITH SAMUELSON: MANY PEOPLE HAVE LOOKED AT THE CALIFORNIA CONCRETE BLOCK HOUSES OF 1923, AS THINGS THAT ALMOST SEEM LIKE AND THAT THIS REFLECTS AN IDEA OF GRIEF. NOW, I CAN'T GET INTO THAT I QUITE BUY THAT. HAWTHORNE: AFTER A WHILE, IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO NOTICE A HISTORIANS HAVE TENDED TO PLAY DOWN THE PRE-COLUMBIAN ASPECTS OF THE HOUSES AND ESPECIALLY THEIR CONNECTIONS TO DEATH AND TO PLAY UP THEIR WIDE RANGE OF OTHER INFLUENCES. ARTISTS, FILMMAKERS, HOLLYWOOD LOCATION DESIGNERS, ON THE OTHER HAND, HAVE ALL HAD A SIMPLER AND PERHAPS MORE INSTINCTIVE TAKE. FRONT OF THEM, RIGHT IN FRONT OF ALL OF US: THAT THESE HOUSES ARE SHADOWED BY VIOLENCE AND EVEN DEATH. THIS MORE DIRECT VIEW, EVEN TO THINK OF THE HOUSES AS A PRECURSOR TO L.A. NOIR. AND FOR ME, IT HARDLY FELT LIKE A LEAP. IF MY EXPERIENCE AS A CRITIC HAS TAUGHT ME ANYTHING, IT'S THAT IF YOU SPEND ENOUGH TIME CLOSELY ENOUGH TO WHAT IT'S SAYING, IT WILL TELL YOU PRETTY KNOW. AND YOU'D HAVE TO BE PUTTING YOUR FINGERS IN YOUR EARS NOT TO HEAR HOW CLEARLY WRIGHT'S LOS COMMUNICATING THEIR MORE FUNEREAL ASPECTS. THAT HAS GROWN UP AROUND THE HOUSES, SOME OF IT FROM WRIGHT HIMSELF, IS CONSISTENTLY DARK SOPHOCLES; BRUTAL; SINISTER; PART OF WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE, I THINK, IS THAT SCHOLARS EMBRACE THE CRUDE CARICATURE OF PRE-COLUMBIAN CULTURE AND ITS THAT OF THE AZTECS, THAT WAS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE WAY AMERICANS UNDERSTOOD THOSE YET THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THOSE CARICATURES SHAPED WRIGHT'S UNDERSTANDING OF PRE-COLUMBIAN AND IT'S NOT AS THOUGH WRIGHT WAS ONE TO DISCOURAGE A PSYCHOLOGICAL READING OF HIS ARCHITECTURE. TO THE CONTRARY, AS THE CRITIC HERBERT MUSCHAMP ONCE POINTED UP HIS LIFE ALONG WITH HIS WORK FOR CRITICAL APPRAISAL, INSISTING THAT NEITHER COULD BE ADEQUATELY UNDERSTOOD WITHOUT KAMIN: HIS ARCHITECTURE SAVES IT BECOMES, YOU KNOW, IT'S THIS MISSION, THIS PROJECT THAT HELPS HIM TO RECOVER FROM THAT, YOU KNOW, JUST HAWTHORNE: IN THE END, I CAME THAT WRIGHT'S L.A. APPARITIONS, ARE NOT JUST HEAVY WAS SOMETHING IN PRE-COLUMBIAN ARCHITECTURE, ITS STARKNESS, ITS STATE OF RUIN, THAT SENSIBILITY THAT MIGHT SUIT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND HIS OWN UNCERTAIN FRAME OF MIND IN THE YEARS FOLLOWING THE MURDERS. I DON'T THINK IT'S THE CASE THAT CRYPT-LIKE TO US BECAUSE THEM IS NOW USED AS A FULL-TIME RESIDENCE. I THINK THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE: I THINK NONE OF THEM IS NOW USED AS A FULL-TIME RESIDENCE PRECISELY BECAUSE THEY'RE CRYPT-LIKE. BECAUSE THEY WERE A MEANS FOR WRIGHT OF FINALLY PUTTING A TROUBLED PERIOD BEHIND HIM FOR GOOD. MAMAH BORTHWICK IS BURIED IN NEXT TO UNITY CHAPEL IN SPRING GREEN. SHE'S ALSO BURIED IN LOS ANGELES. IS MADE POSSIBLE IN PART BY THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS THROUGH THE LOS ANGELES THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES DEPARTMENT OF CULTURAL AFFAIRS THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL AND OTHERS.
