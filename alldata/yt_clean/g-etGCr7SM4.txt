Knuckles: As far back as I can remember, I've been living here on this dark island. Always guarding the Master Emerald, from anything that could harm it I don't know why I was given this job, why it was my fate. Destined to be here... Forever. Huh, who are you? Hmph. What the..? (Rumbling) Oh no, it's starting to happen! Without the Master Emerald's power, this whole island will fall into the ocean! Nazo: Chaos Emerald, captured! (Explosion) Newswoman: What you see here is what's left of Downtown Metropolis after a massive explosion in Gotha city. Right before the explosion took place, Distress call from a jewelry store claiming a monster resembling that of a hedgehog. Had stolen the Chaos Emerald, and broken out of the store. Moments later, a red light filled the sky, and the city was demolished. Reports have confirmed that the being is not Sonic the Hedgehog, as not to make the same mistake twice. The mysterious hedgehog was last seen heading southbound towards the badlands of South Island. The President has announced, the plan forced to combat the alien is our beloved hero, Sonic the Hedgehog. Shadow: &quot;Sonic&quot;... Why does that name... &quot;Bother&quot; me so much? Knuckles: Hey, isn't that...? Tails: SONIC! Sonic: Yo, Tails! Long time, no see! ALRIGHT! Let's go! [Sonic Boom] (Boost) Knuckles: I can sense that the emeralds are here somewhere... Tails: The Emeralds! Sonic: Yes! Huh? What's that? Knuckles: I feel some strange energy... It's that creature again! The same one I saw on my island. He saved me the trouble of looking for him. Now I'll get him good! Hmph. I'll take care of him myself. (Bang) (Neck cracks) Man, he's tough! Hmph. I'm just warming up! LET'S SEE WHAT YOU GOT! Nazo: Hmph. (Smack) (Boom) Nazo: How pathetic. Now for you... (Explosion) (Multiple explosions) How fast &quot;is&quot; this hedgehog!? GAH! CATCH ME IF YOU CAN! Rgh... CHAOS CONTROL! Sonic: HE CAN USE CHAOS CONTROL! (Smack) (Boom) Nazo: DIE! Tails: STOOOP!!! (Explosion) Nazo: What? (Shadow the Hedgehog theme playing...) Sonic: What took ya so long? Shadow: You know, I didn't come to save you... I came for the Chaos Emeralds. So &quot;you're&quot; the one behind all this, huh? Nazo: Who are you? Shadow: You don't know who you're up against. I'm the Ultimate Lifeform! Nazo: Damn.... (Explosion) Shadow: Are you ready to admit your own foolishness? Tails: Cool! Sonic: (in his mind) You must be kidding! Nazo: Hmph. Shadow: UGH! (Crash) Nazo: This is the &quot;Ultimate Lifeform&quot;? HA! Alright, now that that's done... Ah... Ugh! You pest! Sonic: Tails! Tails: Soni- (Boom) Sonic: NOOOO!!!! 'Knuckles....' 'Shadow...'

Sonic: RAAAAAAAAGGGGHHHHH!!!!!!!! Sonic: RAAAAAAAAGGGGHHHHH!!!!!!!! Nazo: Rrrgh... Hmm? Oh yes. Super Sonic if I recall...

Not bad, not bad at all. Nazo: I'll send you to hell! Sonic: Ragh! Ugh.. (Bam) (Shadow laughing evilly) Playtime is over... Time to step it up! Rgh. What is this? I warned you didn't I? I'm the Ultimate Lifeform, Shadow the Hedgehog! Hmph. Looks like this one's for me... Nazo: Super Shadow? How redundant. Hmph. You have no idea what you're up against. Nazo: Ugh! Argh! Shadow: CHAOS CONTROL! Nazo: THAT'S IT! Got him... Shadow: I wasn't even trying. This is the ultimate power! Sonic: Yeah! 200 Rings! (Smack) Heh heh What? Talk about humongus! Shadow: Huagh! You're going straight to hell. CHAOS................. CHAOS................. SPEAR! (Explosion) Now it's time to get serious! RAGH! SHADOW! Chill out! Shadow: Getting serious, eh? Sonic: Come on! This is nothing! Shadow: Huh. He doesn't give up, does he? Sonic: Hey... What if we use Light Speed Attack? Shadow: Heh. You never cease to surprise me... What now? Shadow: Shall we get going? Sonic: BLAST AWAY! Nazo: WHAT'S HAPPENING?! I CAN'T EVEN FOLLOW THEIR MOVEMENTS!! Sonic: Check out my speed now! Shadow: Just watch this! Nazo: UGH! Sonic: Too easy! Nazo: UGH!! DAH!!

Heh heh. Tails: HE'S GOT THE EMERALDS!!! Sonic: WHAT?! Knuckles: What's next? Tails: Now what do we do? Shadow: We have to get him, no matter what. Alright? Sonic: Okay then... Let's get ready to do this. We'll show that creep the REAL POWER OF CHAOS CONTROL! Knuckles: OKAY! Tails: I'm ready! Sonic: Angel Island. What a peaceful place! Shadow: No time for messing around. Knuckles: SONIC! Sonic: NAZO! Nazo: You're too late Sonic! I have all the emeralds and the alter With these elements, I will annihilate this planet! I am pure chaos! Every time this pathetic planet has drawn on negativity of the emeralds, I began to form until it was too much for the emeralds to suppress. With the 7 Chaos Emeralds and the Master Emerald, I will go beyond the strength of a god! Perfect Chaos is nothing compared to me! Sonic, Shadow. Everyone and everything you know is now coming to an end. Witness the raw power, OF CHAOS! [explosion] Amy: SONIC! Nazo: At last. My transformation is complete. For the last moments of your life, you may refer to me as *Perfect* Nazo! Sonic: I've had enough! Who do you think you are anyway? Knuckles: Hey, come on now. DON'T DO IT SONIC! You're mine! What? You're gonna pay for this! ARGH! Shadow: Your weakness disgusts me. I'll show you the ultimate power! CHAOS CONTROL! [boom] Knuckles: There's something wrong with Shadow. Sonic: SHADOW, HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND?! Shadow: HA HA HA HA HA! Knuckles: That's going too far! Shadow: CHAOS... Shadow CHAOS... BLAST! [explosion] Damn it. JUST.... WHO ARE YOU!?!? Perfect Nazo: *I* AM THE ULTIMATE LIFEFORM!!! [smack] [smack] HA HA HA HA HA!! DON'T TELL ME THIS IS THE PLANETS ONLY DEFENSE! I COULD EVEN DREAM IT'D BE THIS EASY! Tails: We can't let him get away with this, can we? Knuckles: Even my attacks are useless... I can't believe that bastard! Tikal: The servers are the seven chaos... Chaos is *power*... power enriched by the *heart*. The controller is the one that *unifies* the chaos. Knuckles: Those Chaos Emeralds.... Sonic: Hmph. You actually thought you could defeat me by TRASNSFORMING INTO A MONSTER?! Per. Nazo: Hyper... Shadow: Behold, the ultimate power! Sonic: There's only one way to go. Ready? Shadow: Okay. Both: CHAOS CONTROL! Knuckles: What is that bright light?! Per. Nazo: No Per. Nazo: Who are you? Are you Sonic or Shadow? SHADIC! Per. Nazo: You can pull any trick you like... But it will only delay the destruction of this universe. Shadic: Too easy! Per. Nazo: This is impossible... [Live and Learn plays] Shadic: Chaos... Wind! [Live and Learn continues] [Live and Learn ends] Per. Nazo: *pant* *pant* Well... You two aren't as easy to kill as I thought... I don't know how you pulled that unification trick with Chaos Control, But I must admit, it was highly impressive. Shadic: Heh heh... Per. Nazo: But tell me, Per. Nazo: But tell me, Hyper Shadic. How many Rings do you have left after that little transformation? Heh Heh Heh Heh... I also admit, that I admire your ability to turn Chaos Emeralds, into Super Emeralds. Something that even I can't do. However, this also works in *my* favor... Now... I can absorb the new reservoir of negative energy! HEEEEGH!!! [boom] Understand this... Understand this... Shadic, Understand this... Shadic, Tails, Understand this... Shadic, Tails, Knuckles. All of you combined, could not match the chaos energy that I now possess. Although you have always been faster that me Shadic... Your speed will mean nothing, when I destroy this planet. Now before everything on earth is obliterated... I will leave you with my final explanation. You see... Being born from negative chaos energy, Makes me naturally inclined to as obtaining power as possible... In time, I will have more energy than any star, any universe... But there is one entity I will never be able to surpass... That's right Knuckles... Your precious Master Emerald. A source of infinite energy, created by the gods themselves. No matter how much energy I absorb, I will never be able to reach a level of infinity. Therefor, the only solution, is to detonate the planet Which in turn, will shatter the Master Emerald, into thousands of pieces. Dispersing them throughout the galaxy, along with their power. Making it impossible to be restored. I will not be damned to eternal subordination towards that rock! Shadic: NO WAY! Per. Nazo: You are annoyingly stubborn... Obviously, you won't resist. So... Let's see... How many Rings you have left... To stop *THIS*! [Live and Learn plays again] [Live and Learn continues] [Live and Learn continues] [Live and Learn continues] [Live and Learn continues] Per. Nazo: AAAAAAHHHH!!!!! Tails: We did it! Knuckles: What's that? Shadic... Shadic: Heh. CHAOS CONTROL! Per. Nazo: What? I'm still alive? Those emeralds prove more useful than I thought... Damn... I suppose I'll just have to try to destroy the earth again... What are you doing?! UGH! No... NO! I will not let this happen. I've had enough of- Nazo: No, you can't be doing this!! NOAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!
