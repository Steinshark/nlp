The task is about to be closed. This time, I won't let them escape again. Brother, come and have a drink. Don't misunderstand me. The teammates I mentioned are not the two idiots behind me. The guy peeing is my informant, Big Head. Soon we will ...do something great together. There's something in the river. You! What? What are you doing? Put the knife down! Shoot! Don't shoot. -He's not on our side. -Big Head. Shoot. I'm shooting. Stop. -Big Head. -I'm shooting. Big Head! You are late. Shooting before landing is not a secret operation. Big Head. Ha, it seems that he is the captain. It's time to work. Take the time to prepare your equipment. This is three kilometers away from the factory. They probably didn't hear the gunfire. Keep your guard here, and we'll be right back soon. Kill those bastards. Set off! It's out of expectation, Monk. Those two foxy guys are still alive. They not only are alive but also have run to this hellish place. Gathered a bunch of rabble. If they were discovered later, they would form an army. If so, we won't be able to handle it with just the few of us. Pooh! Damn army. Only a bunch of rabble. Snort. I have reminded you. The two foxy guys have survived ...in more than ten times of suppression. Although they only have a dozen broken guns left. We shouldn't be careless. You have followed Dad for so many years. I treat you as my own son. I am puzzled. How could I be chased to this hellish place? It turns out you betrayed me. What are you doing? Oh. How can you act without me? Not me. Really not me. Stop talking nonsense! Not me! What happened? Target No.1 appears, and its code name:Dad. Who else? Prepare for action. You ungrateful bastards! When I was in glory, you followed me and did all the terrible things. Now I am suffering, so you want to betray me, right? Now I will show you. If you betray me, this is your end. No, it's really not me. Please, don't kill me. Please, don't kill me. It's not me. It's really not me. Monk, shit! Why not attack this guy harder? He will die. He must die. That's bad. I might have been discovered. If discovered, fire first. Are you sure? Target NO.2 hasn't appeared yet. I'm sure he's in there. It's unmistakable. We're in position and waiting for your firing. It's time to end your life, old fox! Attack! All attack! Come on! Monk, how are you? Action. Monk, report your situation. Have you heard? Target disappeared. Cover us. I'll handle the old fox. Be careful. Bone, Ghost. You search peripheral areas. Run over quickly. Come on. Quickly! Where is the old fox? Where's the little fox? Come out! Come out! I know you are here. Come out! It's bad. We don't find any one of them. Didn't you say he was here? Go to hell, you guys! Grenade! No one can kill Dad! Come on! Are you okay? Chase! No one can kill me. Ha ha. Ha ha. No one can kill me! Ha ha. Snort. His life is mine. Don't compete with me. Have you found the other one? All places have been searched and Target No.2 was not found. Are you sure? I had already confirmed it before coming to meet you all. He's right here. Maybe he left halfway through. Who said the little fox was inside? Another wasted effort. Can you be reliable, Captain? Do you see it? I don't know. Where is he? I don't know. I ask you where he is! No, I really don't know. Where is he? I ask you again. Where is he? I don't know. Look! I really don't know. Damn mercenary! Get off! Target No.2: Little Fox. RPG! Run! Drag him away quickly! Where did they come from? Don't worry about me, just keep firing. Keep firing, don't stop. Go! Go! Target No.2: Little Fox. He appeared. Little fox appears. Who said they only had a dozen broken guns? Where did they get these heavy weapons? It is almost like a formal army. Shut up and continue firing. We can't beat them. We can't deal with this kind of war. Just retreat! No. If he run away this time, we'll never find him again. The firepower is too strong. Retreat, please. We can't beat them. We can't withdraw. Fire! Fight them to death! Fuck! -Bone, are you okay? -I'm okay. -Bone. -We can't deal with this kind of war. We should withdraw. We can't hold this place anymore. Retreat! Go, let's go. What are you doing? We should withdraw. I didn't say retreat he must die. Are you crazy? You'll kill us if you continue. Ghost. -Ghost! -He's dead. It's time for us to leave. Ghost! Go. It's time to withdraw. Let's go. We can't handle this war. If we don't leave, we'll all die here. Go. Go. Ghost! Ghost, I'll take you away. Let's go, go. No, he is our brother. -Ghost -Let's go. This is his fate. Go. Chase! Boss. You call me boss? Sorry, General. Big Head. Ready to retreat. Have you received? Retreat. Big Head. General. Elder brother. Elder brother. Elder brother. Grenade! Run! I think we may have accomplished our mission. Stop talking nonsense and run fast! Ah! Are you Okay? I'm fine. Bone? I'm fine. Damn it! Fire! You cowards! Come out! Don't you want to kill me? I'm here. Come on. Come on! Come out! Go. Bone. Help me. Damn it! Get off! Go fast. Let's go. Come out and chase! Go. Bone. Get up, Bone. Trigger, keep running, don't stop. - Bone, get up. -I can't run anymore. Bone. Bone. They might not be able to catch up with us for a while. What did you say just now? What? We have completed our mission and be able to withdraw. I said maybe. It's just maybe. I said we might have accomplished our mission. Target NO.2's body is not found, so the mission isn't be completed. Ghost is dead. Can't we still leave? Then he can't die in vain. Big Head take Bone away first. We three will stay. We three battle with an army. Are you kidding? An army? You said they were only a bunch of rabble. You... Sooner or later we will be killed by you. That's not a dozen broken guns. Target No.2 didn't appear where you mentioned. Forget about the mission. I don't want to die in this damn place. They come again! Bone, let's go. Go. Big Head, we are coming. We are coming, Big Head! Big Head, have you heard me? Captain. Where are you? Big Head, Big Head. What? Captain. Captain, is that you? Hello, is that you? What? What is us? Where are you, Big Head. Captain. Captain, is that you? Have you heard me? Where are you? Hello? What? Don't come here. Hey! Don't come here. What happened? Big Head. Don't close to me. Big Head. Have you heard me? Can you hear me? Big Head. Speak. Big Head. Speak. Big Head! Big Head, what happened? Big Head, have you heard me? Big Head. Big Head. Big Head is dead. We have no way out. We are flanked. How do they know we will retreat from this direction? Didn't you say ...it is just a small checkpoint that no one goes to? We can't use this anymore. No need anymore. We can't leave any clues for them. After going a few kilometers, we will arrive at the Walong River. We can... Maybe we can find a boat. I think I might not be able to get there. Set off. Let's go. No one will die again. Go. Trigger. Hurry. Run fast. Run fast! Oh, shit! Dead or not? -Get up! -Get up. You idiot! Continue! -Keep chasing. -Get up. Get up! Come on! General, the river has been cleaned up. Good Well done. Surround them. Get up! Go! Let them go and I'll kill you. Go! Go quickly. Get up! Bone. Bone, hold on, Bone. Bone. Don't stop, Bone. Get up, please! No more, I can't go anymore. Hold on. Bone, hold on and get up. You leave here. You take the brothers and go. What are you saying? Let's go. We gotta go. Get up quickly and I'll take you away. You gotta go and leave me alone. Let's go. You can't get out with me. I should have listened to you and lost weight. Here they come again. There aren't many people. Fight or flight? Stop talking nonsense. Pull him up and go. You should go. Take the brothers and go quickly. Get the gun and shoot him. Let's go. Shit! Let's go. We have to go. They are just so-so. Once inside the forest, it's our domain. Sniper! Trigger! How's Trigger? He is dead. Bone. Let's go. Monk, have you found him? Bazooka! Bone. Bone. Bone. Bone! Go. He's dead. Bone! He is already dead. Go. Shit! They also have a sniper. You are the real sniper. Don't worry. And I'll kill them. Go. I definitely believe you will kill them. Go. Go. How far is the Walong River you mentioned? This place is too wide. If they catch up with us, we won't have anywhere to escape. Go. Didn't you hear me talking to you? Gone, my captain. Captain? I don't deserve to be your captain. I underestimated them. You're right. It's me who killed them. If there hadn't been something wrong with my information, We wouldn't have been here. And they wouldn't have died. It's me who killed Ghost. It's me who killed Trigger. I killed Bone. I killed Big Head. It's all my fault. It's all my fault. Then you try not to kill me too. Goie talkie. Did you hear? Hello. Bone, is that you? Hello. Big Head, is that you? Hello. Speak. Hello. You idiot! How can the dead speak? Who are you? Of course you know who I am. I have to say. Although you are stupid, you are still awesome. You killed so many of my surbodinates and destroyed my stronghold. Even you killed my brother. I will find you. How many people do you have left? Where are you? Maybe there aren't many left. They're almost all dead. It's just you. Where are you? By the way, how much is my head worth? Is it valuable? Why don't you speak? Can you hear me? I'm talking to you. Where are you? I'm gonna kill you. I will find you and I will kill you. You are right. It is really not a good place to rest. Go. Let's go. Bone. You really left me alone. I... I saw you... I thought you... I thought you were dead, Bone. I'm back. Bone. Bone. You are still alive. -Of course we should live. -Bone. I thought... -It's okay. -I'm sorry. Monk. Monk, look who's coming. Monk, look who's coming. Monk. Bone, I thought... I thought you were dead. I thought I was dead too. In the forest, I met Trigger, Ghost. They were all scolding you, a leader without any followers. Big Head too. They all said that they have followed you so many years. They were finally killed by you. Then it got dark and I woke up. It turns out to be a dream. I was going around in the woods alone. I was so scared. The wounds made me painful. I can't sleep anymore. If I still slept, I wouldn't be able to survive. Yes. If we still sleep, we won't be able to survive. Bone. Bone. Bone. Bone! Hey. Wake up. You can't sleep anymore. Wake up. Let's go. How long have I slept? An hour. You can't sleep anymore. If you still sleep, we won't be able to survive. You are right. Bone said so too. Maybe you were dreaming. If I die, you'd better not dream about me. Otherwise I'll beat you up. Are you hurt? This is not my blood. I just killed a spy while having a shit. They should not be far away from us. After passing the front, we will be out of their territory. They cme again. Run quickly! They are never-ending. One left. Leave the one to you. Hurry up. Shoot. What are you waiting for? A bunch of reckless idiots rushing around. I didn't expect there were so many people. A dozen of broken guns. Snort. Go. It's just a bunch of scouts. There will be pursuers coming later. Once we pass the front, we'll be out of their territory. We'll be safe soon. Safe? There are warlord, drug dealer and drug-trafficking warlords. They have been fighting with each other for decades. There is no safe place here. That's why we came here from a far place. For the safety of those who want to kill us, we lost Bone, Ghost, Trigger, and Big Head. Maybe we will lose our lives soon. This is really great. By the way, others may not appreciate it. They will say that they are always safe. They have AK47s and bazookas. There are many landmines buried in the ground. Are we qualified to die here? You and I will not die. They won't die in vain. Shut up. You said that before coming here. How could they have died if your intelligence wasn't wrong? You just looked so depressed, so I didn't have the heart to blame you. Pay attetion to your words. I am your captain. A captain without any followers? You accepted this life-threatening job. For eliminating harm and saving the common people? Which of the jobs we do is not life-threatening? We are mercenaries. Risking not for greatness, but for money. And it's money that we can spend alive. Monk. Monk. Monk. Help me. Help me, bastard! Help me. Help me. Monk. Captain. Please help me. Help me. Please help me. Monk. Wait! Don't move. There are... Don't come here. There are... There are... -There are... -There are... landmines. There are landmines. Oh, shit! I told you not to come here, so you really wouldn't like to come. You're a captain without any followers. I am stepping on a landmine. I told you to stop moving. I don't want to die here. I can't die. Shut up. Can you move your hands? If you don't want to die here, just stop the bleeding yourself. This isn't the first time you've been injured. Stop your bleeding quickly. With luck we can survive. I'm already like this. You call this injured. You are really gonna become a captain without any followers. Before we blow ourselves up, we can't die at the hands of those bandits. I really can't hold on this time. Hold on, Monk. I can't do it. It's up to you. Calm down. Loosely coupled anti-personnel mine. It has small pressure range. If it does not malfunctioned, my chance of surviving is... almost... zero. Monk, you are still alive. You want me to die? When we came here in the beginning, I was scared in the water. I thought ...we shouldn't come here. I deliberately argued with you. Pretended to be awesome. I just wanted to make myself ...less scared. You keep talking, keep talking. Don't sleep. I'm not a great sniper. I don't even know where my opponent is hiding. I can't find him. He slipped away from me several times. I failed to protect Ghost. Failure to protect Trigger. Besides Bone. Sorry. I'm so sorry. Stop talking. Save your strength. It's all my fault. I killed them. I agree with this too. Stop talking. You can't escape if you step on a landmine. Before you get blown up, I really regret not giving you a beating. Monk. Monk. Monk. These two idiots stepped on a landmine. It is really... Catching a turtle in the pot. This is an easy prey in a trap. You have talked too much. Go. Go up! Monk. Monk, they are here again. Monk. It's nothing. Let's go. I want to catch them alive. They have a sniper. No. They have nothing left. You are their main target. They may be waiting for you. They are indeed waiting for me. Waiting for me to save them. Go! Wake up. They're here again. Monk. Don't close to me. Stop! Monk, wake up. Monk. Don't come here. I'm shooting. Don't come here. I'm gonna shoot you. Don't come here. Don't come here. I'm gonna shoot. I am really gonna shot. I'm shooting. I'm gonna kill you. Explore the way ahead. Go. Don't come here. I will shoot. Don't come here. Don't come here. Don't come here. Don't shoot. Don't shoot. He is injured. Do you have a doctor? I surrender. Monk. You basterd! We seem to have met before. You bastard! It's you who killed my brother. I thought you had so many teammates. Just a few. All dead. Heaven is really wise. There are only a few landmines, but you stepped on them. Wow. Are you injured? Ah. Look. Have a look. What is a real man? This is what a real man is. He hurts so much, but he daren't move at all. So, You are also afraid of death, right? Then I'll take you with me to death. This is my territory. I know even an ant on the ground. What you stepped on could be anything. But it definitely can't be a landmine. Explain tell me! I won't tell you who sent me here. Really stubborn. Say or not? Say! I will say. What should I say? What should I say? I say fuck your mother! There are so many people who want to kill you. What's the meaning of knowing who sent me? Stop! I just want to know how much money you can get if you kill me. Just a nameless rat. You are worthless. You can kill me. Kill me! Then you gotta beg me. Hang him up! You old fox! After all, you are a businessman. Why are you so careless? You dare accept anyone. Another bad guy disappeared in the world. After I avenge you, I'll grab a good place for you. -drink. -Drink. Look, he is just like a fool. A fool. Cheers! Water. Drink. -No, no. -Drink. -Water. -Continue. You're really useless. Water. Water? Water. You want water? Drink. Come here. Where is he? Where is he? I don't know. What are you doing? Five bullets. One for Bone. One for Trigger. One for Big Head. One for ghost. The last one for Monk. Stop him for me! Damn broken gun! Wait! I have to say. So many people want to kill me. You are the closest. If you are a real man, put down the gun ...and challenge me one-on-one. You don't deserve it. Stop. Stop! Stop. Stop, wait a moment. Wait a moment. Aren't you just killing me for money? How much do you want? I'll give you. Guess how much money I have. And How much land I have. I'll give all to you. How about letting me go? How about it? It's a good idea, right? That's right.
