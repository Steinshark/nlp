Hello everyone, I'm Da Wen. Today, we're going to visit the rural market in Xi'an. Jiao Dai Town is located in the east of Xi'an. It retains the most traditional rural market customs of Xi'an. Just at the entrance of the market, many villagers are gathered around, admiring cute dogs and rabbits. Will this grow big? Look how long its legs are. The villagers really like these little dogs, but they have one condition for buying them: they don't want them to grow up. If the dogs will grow up, they won't buy them. The vendor guarantees that these dogs will never grow up. This cute little dog yawned big, looks like he's really tired. Sure enough, these three dogs fell asleep in a huddle in no time. The dogs stare eagerly at the vendor's breakfast, as if reprimanding them: &quot;You're too much!&quot; &quot;You should share!&quot; In the end, only these two barking dogs got a tasty treat. The other dogs would go hungry. Who told you not to learn from those two barking dogs? What about those two barking dogs next to them? This simple-looking old man is selling adorable little rabbits. Look, this grass isn't fresh at all. &quot;Is this a male or female rabbit?&quot; &quot;This is a female rabbit.&quot; A customer asked the old man if it's a male or female rabbit, and the old man said it's a female. Little rabbits. You have to keep it in there. How much is one? Oh, 20 yuan. One little rabbit costs only 20 yuan. It's really worth it. Another group of villagers came to watch the old man's rabbits. I can't tell if it's male or female. Sell the male to you. Don't want the male. There are also many villagers who like rabbits. Most of them would ask first: Is this a male or female rabbit? Buy a female. I'll give you a cage for free, easy to carry. But you said you didn't want a cage earlier. You said you didn't want a cage earlier. Look at what's being sold at this stall in front. It turns out to be all kinds of second-hand kitchenware and tools. Didn't expect that. Second-hand kitchenware and tools can also be sold here. There are old power sockets, and second-hand metal belt heads. All of these can be sold. Let's continue into the market and see what delicious food there is. Let's see what this one sells. It turns out to be leek pancakes. But besides leeks, it also has vermicelli, and scrambled eggs. Xi'an really lives up to its title as the capital of carbs. Whether in the city or countryside of Xi'an, there are all kinds of pancakes made mainly from carb ingredients. And these pancakes with noodles inside are simply a joy of carbs wrapped in carbs. Look, this old man is selling freshly roasted chestnuts. This machine stirs black pebbles, used to evenly heat these chestnuts. These freshly roasted chestnuts smell really good. If I weren't holding a camera to shoot the video, I'd really want to buy some and taste them. As I approached to film, some of the chestnuts actually exploded, splattering me with chestnut meat. The old man said to pour some water, then the chestnuts wouldn't explode. But after he poured the water, several chestnuts still exploded, splattering me all over with chestnut meat. Old man, you deceived my feelings. Let's see what this one sells. It turns out to be jelly noodles. This kind of jelly noodles has a nice name here: Fairy Noodles.

So, dining by the bustling roadside, with a cheerful atmosphere, various condiments are placed in the middle of the table, such as scallions, chili oil, persimmon vinegar, salt, and garlic paste.

Isn't the dust a bit too much for outdoor dining? This stall ahead sells a traditional dish from northern China, Pig Skin Jelly. The method of making pig skin jelly involves boiling pig skin, along with various seasonings, for a long time to extract gelatin from the skin. Then it is cooled, causing the skin and broth to solidify together. Once cooled, it's ready to be served with condiments. As it's consumed cold, the cooling process is akin to freezing, hence the name, Pig Skin Jelly. So, would you like to try it? Can I try a piece? You can break off a piece yourself.
