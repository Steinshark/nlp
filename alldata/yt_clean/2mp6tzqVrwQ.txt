What's going on? It's been two hours, and it still hasn't started. What's with the delay? What happened? We want to see Zhang Mandi! What took them so long? Mandi, come out! Mr. Lin, Mr. Lee and Mr. Ye have been talking for a long time inside. People are still waiting for them to host the opening ceremony. Shall we... What's the rush? If they aren't on the same page, nothing can be progressed. Just wait. I'm old and useless now. Are you feeling better? Thank you. Thanks. They've started beating drums out there. And they are waiting for us to appear. I'm not trying to give you a hard time. As long as you agree to leave the two plots alone, I'll play along and put on a show with you. Mr. Ye, though you hold only 10% of the shares in this hotel, and you are not on par with a major shareholder like me, you are still the owner after all. What's in it for you if the opening ceremony is ruined? It's quite simple. If you leave the plots of land on the third ring road to me, I'll walk out with you and co-host today's ceremony. If you don't agree, I believe tomorrow's finance headline will feature the scandals about your Lee Corporation. [The Opening Ceremony of Shenghua Hotel of the Lee Corporation] Great performance! Bravo! Bravo! Nice dance! [ Mandi's fans] Mandi! Mandi! Mandi! Mandi! Mr. Ye, you know that I hold 20% of the shares in your company. But I don't think being a minor shareholder can satisfy my interest in your company anymore. Mr. Lee, you must be joking. My three properties will soon be put on the market. By then, the stock price will be soaring. I'm well aware of your cash flow situation. I'm afraid acquiring my company is not a wise decision. Your three properties haven't been licensed for pre-sale, right? So what? [Mandi, we love you!] Mandi! Mandi! We love you! Mandi! Ladies and gentlemen, our ribbon-cutting ceremony will commence soon . Please be patient and wait for a while. Miss Mandi, the performance part is over now. When can we meet your good friend Mr. Lee? Is today's event to celebrate the opening of the hotel or for you to announce the good news between you and Mr. Lee? That's right. Tell us what the good news is. The Sun Group is your contractor. But they have been waiting for the right timing to acquire your company. The three properties will be selling like hot cakes, so everyone would want a share. As far as I know, they hold 32% of the shares in your company. If they obtain the shares that I hold, I'm afraid that your company will no longer belong to the Ye family. Think about your son. If you work with me, your son may still have a chance to inherit your company. And you can still keep your company. If you force me to turn to Mr. Sun, your son will have to work as an employee just like everyone else. Mr. Lee, don't push me. You don't want to burn any bridges. I, Lee Zhongmou, have neither a father nor a son. I don't need a way out. On this special day, being surrounded by my fans and the media friends who support me makes me happy already. I'm very thankful for your concerns about my dating life. I can tell you that I love him, and I love you guys more. The younger generation may outperform the older one. Mr. Lee, I'm impressed by your smart moves. They are very tactical. You won. Please. Ye, I just discussed your career with your father inside. Good luck. Guohua, go get ready. Let's go. We've got a spy. Ladies and gentlemen, the opening ceremony of Shenghua Hotel of the Lee Corporation will begin now. Yeah! Great! Look! Dear media friends and guests, it's an honor to have you here. I believe you all know that the Lee Corporation... Miss Mandi. Mom, my stomach aches. I need to go to the bathroom. You... I told you not to eat that much. Come on, let's go find a ladies room. Godmother, Keke wants to go to the ladies room, but I can't go there. You are just a kid. It doesn't matter. Let's go. I can't. My mother said I 'm a big boy now. I can't go to the ladies' room. Mom, I can't hold it anymore. I'm going to poo in my pants. Tongtong, then stay here. I'll be right back . Don't leave. Mr. Zhao, the Vice President, Mr. Ouyang, the CMO, [International Star] and Miss Zhang Mandi, a famous star. I hereby announce that the ribbon-cutting ceremony begins now. Please welcome the emcee ! Mandi! Mandi! Mandi! Dad, don't bother with it. Let's get out of here. Let's leave. Careful. Let's go. Hurry. Come on. Mandi. Please don't panic. Be careful. Security, please take care of the injured. Where's his mother? Where's this boy's mother? He's bleeding. Zhongmou, don't go there. It's too dangerous. Mr. Lee, let's go. Take him to the hospital. Go get the car, now. Okay . Excuse me! Make way! Make way, please! Step back! Step back! Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Follow them. Go to the nearest hospital. Alright. It hurts. It hurts so much. It hurts. We 'll get to the hospital soon. Good boy. [International Star] Wow, so much stuff. Wu Tong, bye. Wu Tong, watch it, will you? Sorry! Sorry! It was an accident. I'm sorry! Make 50 copies of this document for the meeting tomorrow. Mr. Xu, today is my son's birthday. May I not work overtime today? I promise I'll get them ready tomorrow morning. No, it can't wait. There are other things to do tomorrow. Birthday can be celebrated every year. It's no big deal to miss one. But the job must be done by today. Go ahead. He's born an arrogant toady. Wu Tong, don't take it personally. I'll help you make the copies. Just go home and celebrate your son's birthday. Xiaoxiao, how can I trouble you? Never mind. You've helped me a lot. You big softie, just take this favor as my gift for your son's birthday. Come on. Cut it out. Raising a kid by yourself isn't easy. Now, off you go. Don't make Tongtong wait for too long. Go. Hurry. Go home. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you so much ! You are very welcome! Just go. Sorry, excuse me. - Hello? - Wu Tong, where are you? I'm on the bus. I'll be back soon. Hold on a sec. Sir, please sit here. Thank you. Is Tongtong getting anxious? Tell him I'm on my way home. Listen to me... Hold on, I have a call coming in. Hello? Hello? Hello? Ma'am. Are you Wu Tongtong's mother? We found your contact information on him. He's injured and admitted to the hospital now. Please come to the emergency room of Yanda Hospital. What? Stop the bus! Stop the bus! What are you doing? - Stop the bus! Please stop the bus! - We can't stop midway. Excuse me! Sir, my son had an accident! Please stop the bus! Sir, I'm begging you! I can't stop the bus midway. You can't get off here. Sir! Please open the door. Let her get off. Sir! Sir! Alright, okay. Are you okay? Are you okay? I'm fine. Taxi! Taxi! Sir, Yanda Hospital. Please hurry! Okay. [Yanda International Hospital] Tongtong! Tongtong! Tongtong! Tongtong ! Tongtong! Are you his mother? Doctor, I'm his mother. How's my son? The artery of his leg got hurt. He lost a lot of blood because of that. What should we do? He's in shock for excessive bleeding. He needs a blood transfusion right now, or his life will be in danger. Then please do it. What's your blood type? It's type B. Is there anyone in your family who shares the same blood type with your son? No! No! Doctor Li. I've contacted all the blood banks. It'll take at least five hours for the transport. Five hours? That's too long. I'm not sure if your son can make it after five hours. Please prepare yourself for the worst. Please don't! Tongtong! Tongtong! Tongtong! How is this kid doing? Please wait outside if you are not a family member. Don't interrupt the treatment. In your eyes I see one drop of crystal tear of sorrow With the pouting lips I once kissed In my eyes are the glittering tears of pain With the trembling shoulder you once leaned on Wait. Wait! All there's left are two faces of woe Could you save this child? Save him? How? If you give him your blood, he'll live. Why? Because you share the same blood type. Please! Please save him! How do you know what my blood type is? Because... Because what? What can I do I'm begging you! Please save him! Please! Please save his life! I'm begging you! Please save his life! Please! I'm begging you! Please save him! Please! Please save him! If you don't explain, I don't think I can help you. Because he's your son! He's the boy's father. Sir, do you have this blood type? If you do, please save this child. Till you no longer want to see me I start to realize how much I miss you What can I do It's so hard [Emergency Code Room] What can I do Are you the boy's mother? I'm sorry about your son. Don't worry. I'm sure he'll make it. I heard that your son is my fan. This is an autographed photo of mine. Thank you. Mr. Lee is here. Zhongmou, are you okay ? I'm fine. Good to know. How's the kid inside? Wu Tongtong's parent, please come to the emergency room. Wu Tongtong's parent, please come to the emergency room. Wu Tongtong's parent, please come to the emergency room. Mr. Lee. Zhongmou. What happened? Nothing. You did very well today. Thank you. You can go back now. I'll call you tomorrow. Jiandong. If a woman told you that her child is yours, what would you do? What do you mean? Earlier at the hospital, the injured boy's mother told me that the boy was my son. Song, turn around, hurry. No need. I'd like to find out what's going on first. Take this for a DNA test .I want to see who dares to play such a prank on me. [Inpatient] Tongtong. Mom, my leg hurts badly. Tongtong, you got injured. Just stay in bed and rest. It'll heal soon, okay? Mom, what happened to your head ? I accidentally fell. It's no big deal. Did you see my photo? Tongtong, it's here. Is my birthday over? It's not over yet. Why? This is my gift for you. Tongtong, did you get injured when you tried to get this photo for me? I know you like Miss Mandi, so I wanted to get her autograph. What makes you think I like Mandi? You'd watch her whenever she appears on TV. Tongtong is such a good boy. I made a birthday wish, that Dad will be back from the magic school soon, and live with us forever in the future. Will my wish come true? Tongtong, your wish will come true. Do you hear me? Be good. Close your eyes and sleep . Where's his mother? I'm begging you! Please save his life! If you don't explain, I don't think I can help you. Because he's your son! [Office Entrance A] [The office of the president] Mr. Lee, the boy is really your son. [The probability of paternity is 99.9999%.] And that woman? That woman's name is Wu Tong. She's 27 years old, from Nanjing. During her last semester of college, she worked in our company as an intern. It was five years ago exactly. You don't have any recollection of her? Do you remember her? I don't. But I did find out that she worked [Resume] as an intern in the Admin Office back then. The Manager of the Admin Office has resigned three years ago. I called him, and he said he did recall a girl named Wu Tong who worked as an intern in his Dept. And she was quite outstanding. But she left unexpectedly before her internship ended, and no one has ever heard from her again since then. Tongtong is four years old now. The day he got injured was actually his birthday. So when Wu Tong left the company, she might have been pregnant with your child . And then? After she left, she returned to her hometown Nanjing. But for some unknown reasons, she came back to Beijing not long after. She had her child delivered at a commune hospital in the outskirt of Beijing. Then she left Beijing and went to a few different cities. She just came back again at the end of last year. She's with an advertisement company now working as a planner. What about her financial status? Not very good. By the way, she was diagnosed with postpartum depression after labor. What about her family? Her mother was a preschool teacher, and her father a technician. They are both retired and live in Nanjing. Wu Tong hasn't returned to Nanjing for five years. Mr. Lee. What's up? Your mother called earlier, asking you to go home for dinner. Let me go! Lee Zhongmou, come out! Please calm down. What are you doing? I've worked for you for a long time, and I should be given some credit for that. Get out of here. You wanna get rid of me like a dog? You are dreaming! Let go of me. - Just leave. - Let go of me! Get out of here, now! You've got to give me an explanation. Or I won't leave. Guohua, this is the workplace. Don't make a scene here. Get back to work. We are all civilized people. Let's have a talk. Come on. Let's go. Wait here. What do you want? Name it. I won't talk to you. I want to talk to Lee Zhongmou in person. What did you say? What did you say just now? I've worked here longer than you. How could he fire me for no reason? Zhao Guohua, you think I don't know that you fed Ye Runxiang our company's secrets? Listen , you should feel lucky that you live in a law-based society. If it were in the past, I'd have you disabled. You are literally a gangster. What's in it for you sticking up for Lee Zhongmou? He's just a cold -blooded ingrate. And who do you think you are? You are just Lee Zhongmou's dog. Zhao Guohua, I'll give you one last chance. Get out of my sight before I lose my temper. Don't be so shameless. Don 't you push me! Tell Lee Zhongmou that I'm not a pushover! I'm capable of doing anything in desperation! I'll see what you can do. I'll be waiting. Mr. Lee, rarely do you come home for dinner. Please help yourself. Madam Lee asked me to cook these dishes for you especially. Uncle Chen, don't bother cooking these many dishes in the future. The two of us won't be able to finish them. How could you finish them when you don't have any appetite? Even your favorite food becomes tasteless when you eat with your mother. Madam, don't say that. Mr. Lee surely has an appetite. Madam Lee personally designed the menu for you. No one knows you better than your mom. Madam Lee knows very well what your favorite food is. Mr. Lee, please enjoy. These are all your favorite dishes in childhood. Madam, Mr. Wang, President of Hongda Group, invites you and Mr. Lee to attend the celebration party for his grandson's birth. Send him the jade lock I bought from auction as a gift. I won't be going. Okay. Going out more is good for your health. Thank you for still caring about my health. I do hope you can go out more. It'll make you feel happier. Why would I go celebrate someone else's grandson's birth? Should I tell people that I have a son who never wants to get married or let them make fun of us for having no heir? Getting married or not is up to me. You've never got married either. You just want a grandson who carries on our family name and inherits the family business. I can give you that. [Incoming Call ] Hello? Hello? Am I speaking to Wu Tong? Yes. Who is this? I'm Lin Jiandong, the Special Assistant to Mr. Lee Zhongmou. Miss Wu, I'd like to talk to you about the child. You said Lee Zhongmou? [Mute] As soon as I mentioned that I was your Special Assistant, she hung up right away, even turned her phone off. Come in. Mr. Lee, there are many reporters outside. They want to interview you about your illegitimate son. I've asked the security to keep them down the lobby. Shall we... I'll go handle it. Rumor has it that Lee Zhongmou, the Chairman of the Lee Corporation, has an illegitimate son. Is that true? If it's true, would it affect his relationship with Miss Zhang Mandi? Could you tell us more details? Who's the child's mother? How will this rumor impact on the Lee Corporation? Quiet. Please quiet down. First of all, I'd like to thank you for your concerns on behalf of the Lee Corporation. But we really have no idea who started the rumor. My secretary has taken down your questions. It takes time to verify the truth. If you want to know the truth, please give us some time. We will answer all your questions then. Thanks. Mr. Lin. Mr. Lin, please tell us more. Someone intentionally leaked the information. Otherwise, the media wouldn't have come this quickly. Looks like someone is trying to tarnish your name. It must be someone who's close to me. It's most likely someone in our company. Don't worry. I'll track this person down. Don't bother yet. I don't care about the rumor. What I care about is this kid. Got it. Miss Wu. You are avoiding me, aren't you? [DNA Paternity Test Results] Let's have a talk. Just a few minutes. Let me go. What are you doing? Let go of me! What do you want? Stop the car. I have nothing to talk with you. I'll call the police . Calm down. I only want to talk to you. After all, Mr. Lee is Tongtong's father. It's only normal for him to get back the custody. No way! Stop the car! Stop the car, now! - Stop the car ! - Don't move! Stop the car! What do you want? Miss Wu, you should at least consider it for Tongtong's sake. You are wasting your time. You rent a place and raise a kid as a single mother. Your salary can barely cover the basic living expenses and Tongtong's tuition fees. Considering your financial status, Tongtong will be better off living with Mr. Lee. Of course, if you agree to give up custody, Mr. Lee will make it up to you by paying you a great amount of money, which can totally change your life. By then, you can get married and have a child to start a new life. Isn't that the best for you? Money may be very important to you, but to me, nothing is more important than Tongtong. Please tell Lee Zhongmou that Tongtong is my son. He's no one else's concern. Miss Wu, as the Special Assistant to Mr. Lee, I've said what I have to say. But as Lee Zhongmou's good friend, I have to warn you that I'd do anything for him when necessary. Let me tell you. Unless I die, or no one can take Tongtong away from me. Hello? Will you just leave me alone? Miss Wu , Mr. Lee wants to see you. You can tell him in person what he can do to change your mind. I don't want to see anybody. Do not call me ever again. Miss Wu. You may not want to see me , but it's not up to you to decline this meeting. I only have ten minutes. Let's have a talk in my car if you don't mind. Let go of me! Let go of me! Do we know each other? We don 't. Then how did you get pregnant with my child? I was lying. I... I lied to you. Tongtong... Tongtong is not your son. He has nothing to do with you. Nothing to do with me? Then how do you explain the DNA Paternity Test Results? I don't know. Why didn't you tell me that you were carrying my child? What do you want exactly? I... I don't want anything. It... It was just an accident. You used Zhang Mandi and that accident to have Tongtong appear in my life. Tell me, what do you want exactly by planning all this? Tell me what you want! I want nothing but Tongtong. I want nothing but Tongtong. Alright, alright. I see. What is it? We've found out who leaked the information to the media. It's Zhao Guohua. Don't worry. I'll deal with it immediately. Deal with him later. Let my lawyer get ready. I must get the custody of the child. As a leading investment bank company, our Lee Corporation has many new ambitious competitors. If you are involved in a lawsuit, I'm afraid our company and your image will be negatively affected. I couldn't care less about the media. I only want to get my son back. Mr. Lee... Understood. [Special Report on the Case of Lee's Custody Battle] Many entrepreneurs will be here today. [China Charity Federation] [Charity Activity] He should be here soon. Here he comes! Mr. Lee. Mr. Lee, talk to us. Mr. Lee, please say something. Mr. Lee. Mr. Lee. I'm sorry. Mr. Lee Zhongmou and Miss Zhang Mandi won't accept any interview today. Sorry. Mr. Lee, who's that? Mr. Lee, how are you doing? - Mr. Lee. - Mr. Lee. As I said, I will keep you posted if there's any new information. I didn't expect that I'd like that kid so much. You know what? I think I have a special bond with Tongtong. I knew I liked him at the first sight. Here is fine. Alright, shall we begin? We'll be even happier after getting Tongtong's custody. I've got to learn how to get along with a child, and learn fast. I believe you'll be good at it. What about Tongtong's mother then? I only want my son. When it comes to women, you are all I want. I do feel sorry for her, though. You won't treat me and our child like this in the future, will you? Of course not. I won't marry you or have a child with you anyway. Are you okay? The famous movie star Zhang Mandi and her wealthy boyfriend Lee Zhongmou, the President of the Lee Corporation, are attending a charity activity together, which scotched the rumor that their relationship was in crisis. According to a reliable source, Mr. Lee Zhongmou is determined to win the lawsuit over the custody. People say it's hard to settle family troubles... Wu Tong! Wu Tong! Is that true? How can Tongtong be Lee Zhongmou's child? When we first came to Beijing, you went to college and I started working. We shared every little secret with each other. I thought you just had a crush on him. How did you get pregnant with his child? Tell me what happened. Meiling, I'm in a mess, and I can't even think straight right now. Please don't ask me those questions. Even if I don't ask, it won't stop Lee Zhongmou from fighting you over the custody. I just don't get it. Where was he when you were bearing his child?
