There's a stall in the market making non-stick pans on-site. The silver pots in front are untreated iron pots. The chef is using a high-temperature blowtorch to heat the surface of the pots. The purpose is to form a dense oxide film on the surface of the iron pot. This film not only has a non-stick effect but also prevents the iron pot from rusting. After high-temperature treatment, the surface of the iron pot will form tiny pores. Then pour cooking oil into the pot, pouring it around the edge of the pot. I'm teaching you how to maintain your pot. Then pour out the oil from the pot. Repeat pouring oil into the pot. Regular maintenance, and it'll never stick. After high-temperature treatment, the surface of the iron pot will form tiny pores. At this time, applying cooking oil can make the oil penetrate into these pores. Thus forming a layer of oil film. This layer of oil film not only enhances non-stickiness but also isolates air, preventing the iron pot from rusting, thus extending its service life. I'll scan your QR code for payment.
