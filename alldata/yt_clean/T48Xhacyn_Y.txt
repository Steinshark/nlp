He shouldn't have said - I'm upset. - He didn't want to spend money. Recently, my husband left the room. - Pardon? Are you using separate rooms? Yes. One day, he said that I snore. He doesn't come back to the room with that as an excuse. There's a bed in the other room - Yes. And... Actually, it's scary when I sleep alone. So one day, without thinking much, I said, And he didn't even pretend He still hasn't returned That must be upsetting. - Yes, it is. there's a TV too. I don't get why you're scared - I don't get it. It's because you've been sleeping It's really comfortable I leave the TV on when I sleep. I set a timer on the TV... when I go to sleep. - I listen to it... Hee Chul's mother wants to... sleep in the same bed She's already so old. Why would she want to sleep It's their family matter! She says she wants to Why would you criticize that How about... - going to your husband's room? - That's... Is your husband going through I think so.

So plant a tree with me. (Dumbfounded) At the entrance of the house. We need to plant this. So we need to do that. We need to dig the ground What did you say? - Right now. (No, we should What's this? A shovel. This isn't right. (A trowel?) They're using a trowel? (A trowel?) They're using a trowel, The ground must be frozen so I bet it'll be hard to dig. (He begins shoveling It's actually hard. (Dumbfounded) Seriously... Your way of thinking itself is wrong. (He joins Sang Min They sent the wrong type of shovel. It doesn't matter. If they sent the wrong ones, - But... I thought it'd work. Then you should do this alone. Why would you let me do this (Feeling bad) Who wouldn't complain Tell me. (He gets back to shoveling I think I'm the normal one. (He shovels hard - How deep does it have to go? (Sorry. Please help me out.) (Poking) (Sighing) I think we should dig (Tiny bit) I think we should dig I think it's harder to break it (The ground is harder I don't think they can dig... deep enough for the tree They could at least give it a try (They continue to shovel.) Gosh, this is... Jae Hoon, let me go get shovels. From where? - Around here. - I'll be right back. I'll go get them and be back soon. Where are you going to buy shovels?

I cremated him, and he's in an urn. I put him in an urn... made of soil on purpose. So I wanted to plant a tree... and bury him underneath. - Oh, no. Oh, no. But I didn't know it'd be this hard. I've been having a hard time Oh, no. (The white angel came to Sang Min My goodness. Toto. Gosh, he's really pretty. (Toto kept Sang Min's side Where were you? You want more? He must've grown attached to him. (Now Toto has left (And Sang Min hasn't been able (He wanted to let Toto Then I'll be able to... greet Toto But I didn't know it'd be this hard.
