Yippee-ki-yay, movie lovers, I'm Jan and in cut from Frozen 2, plus the amazing Anna and movie. If you want to jump to any individual deleted video description. There's an intriguing deleted scene from early the original inspiration for Elsa's big ballad The scene takes place just after the sisters of charades; from a cloud created by Elsa's dream. This deleted scene shows how Elsa's ice magic and that she can unconsciously project moving The images of Iduna and the Enchanted Forest for the dream-like memories and visions that Elsa's dream continues and takes a nightmarish in the forest. And the strong emotions this generates in a mini-storm inside the bedroom. In that final moment, Elsa literally freezes of ice crystals, which was where the idea crystals at the end of Into The Unknown. Another fascinating deleted scene from early hidden room inside Arendelle castle, where out into the origins of Elsa's powers. &quot;Magical arts. Dangers of dark magic. Father was studying magic.&quot; &quot;Ooh. Oh!&quot; &quot;He was studying me too.&quot; &quot;Wait, what?&quot; &quot;This is some sort of journal. I can find no record of a human with power tragic fates.&quot; &quot;Wait a minute, this isn't father's handwriting, If we look more closely at the journal, we father gave her in the first movie in an attempt &quot;The gloves will help. See? Conceal it.&quot; &quot;Don't feel it.&quot; And the journal entry which mentions &quot;the us understand why Elsa's parents wanted to fear that her magical nature would lead her This moment would also have set up the idea her fate later in the movie when she freezes The final part of the deleted scene gives &quot;These next pages are in English, but also.. Northuldrian.&quot; &quot;Northuldrian? But that language is forbidden. Why would mother know it? Or dare use it?&quot; &quot;Whatever evil my people did, whatever darkness I can no longer turn my back on the past.&quot; This tells us that Northuldra culture was probably why Iduna kept her research secret perhaps why she hadn't yet told her daughters The deleted scene helps explain just how much about how to deal with Elsa's magic and shows It also reveals how the sisters ended up with This is also likely where Elsa and Anna would in which they try to understand the meaning A wonderful song deleted from the beginning in which she sings about how much she loves Let's take a look. The intention behind this beautiful number Queen for Arendelle by the end of the film. It shows how she is completely at ease and &quot;Either way, for what it's worth, this perfect Is home And it would also have highlighted just how the dam that threatens to flood Arendelle. And it would also have highlighted just how the dam that threatens to flood Arendelle. The sweetness of this song also contrasts Right Thing&quot; which she sings at her absolute and Olaf are gone. &quot;Home&quot; would have also contrasted more with the differences between the sisters and foreshadowing In other words, Anna loves her kingdom and &quot;Hey, come 'ere. Take this coin and go buy a custard bun for &quot;OK.&quot; Whereas Elsa is drawn by a call from afar Sadly, the filmmakers had to cut the song Things Never Change&quot; when they realised they show what was at stake for Elsa, Kristoff However, they did take the overall theme of compressed it into the line that Anna says Never Change&quot;: and the gates are open wide... &quot;Unmeltable Me&quot; is a great song by Olaf that It was the movie's original way to explain little snow flurry that Elsa gave him in the &quot;Who is present, but not liquescent? That's right, I just learned to read I imagine a lot of fans would have loved to In the final film, this song was replaced snowman and casually asks him about his new of an autumn day. There's a great shot in the first teaser trailer and attacking someone off camera. That scene never made it into the final movie any longer. However, when the filmmakers discovered just they made sure she had one in the movie, albeit In the final film, when the gang are scared forest, Anna grabs an ice sword from one of the group against the Northuldra and Arendellians Kristoff's part in Frozen 2 underwent some At the beginning of the original story, Kristoff again from his official title of &quot;Ice Master of the first film. However, given Kristoff's humble origins, high society. And he was keeping his feelings about this The truth would eventually come out though water spirit. &quot;I think he's offering you a ride.&quot; &quot;Are you afraid?&quot; &quot;No, afraid of what?&quot; &quot;Afraid he won't see truth in your heart and &quot;Er.&quot; &quot;Are you?&quot; &quot;What? No. Course not.&quot; &quot;Then get on.&quot; &quot;See, I knew it would be fine. Kristoff!&quot; &quot;I'm OK. I'm..&quot; &quot;Except the part where his heart's full of &quot;Are you OK? Are you good?&quot; &quot;I'm good. Thank you.&quot; &quot;Except you're lying about something.&quot; &quot;I don't like fancy shoes or regal jackets.&quot; &quot;Not a problem.&quot; &quot;I don't like ceremonies or polite conversations.&quot; &quot;How about ice mastering and delivering?&quot; &quot;No, cos it's not a thing.&quot; &quot;Formal dinners and ballroom dancing?&quot; &quot;No, and no.&quot; &quot;Do you even like your life in Arendelle at Just tell me the truth.&quot; &quot;No I don't like my life in Arendelle.&quot; &quot;So, it was all a lie, all of it? &quot;Anna, I..&quot; &quot;I don't think we should get married.&quot; I think this scene would have come around the Enchanted Forest. The Nokk did appear briefly to Olaf in the between Anna and Kristoff would have been Overall, this unused scene feels just a little where the couple are split up in the forest with each other and because Anna is focussed However, there is another deleted Kristoff in a grand, glorious and hilarious way when You can watch my full breakdown of that in The opening scene and prologue of Frozen 2 and the Enchanted Forest was changed many had to match up with any other story changes On the Blu-ray, there's an alternate prologue escaped the fighting between the Arendellians In this version, when the spirits are angered, Iduna rescues him. Mattias then picks them both up and puts them and heading back to Arendelle. In the final film, Agnarr says he never knew deleted scene, what we get is Elsa seeing learning that it was Iduna who smuggled herself took them out of the forest. An interesting detail in this alternate prologue in the forest who can either shapeshift or This mystery human saves Iduna at one point King of Arendelle. This Is Us star Sterling K Brown's character earlier versions of the film. Originally, the high-ranking military man all by himself, rather than with his fellow Mattias's original story would have included deleted from the movie as, ultimately, it The trailer scene of the wind spirit Gale in the forest and blowing him into the air The reason for that is the scene is actually how to animate the personality of the wind The longer version of this scene is on the between young Iduna and Agnarr. Another cut trailer scene shows a young Iduna cross over the dam to greet the Arendellians. And this trailer scene of Kristoff riding final movie either. The trailer scene of Olaf standing next to the forest was altered for the final movie And in another change from the trailers, this window at the Northern Lights was replaced of the window together. There's also a much darker original ending off Elsa and destroyed Arendelle. To learn all about that as well as Kristoff's the link in the video description.
