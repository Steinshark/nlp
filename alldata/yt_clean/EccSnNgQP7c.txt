THOMPSON'S VILLAGES IS, IMPORTANT, AND THAT IS UP SPENDING THEIR FIRST STOPPING POINT AND THEN ON IT SAYS THIS MAP BELONGS &quot;ON THIS DAY I MARRIED DAVID THOMPSON, AT 29, THOMPSON MARRIED ILE A LA CROSSE , A TRADING ON THE CHURCHILL RIVER. OF MIXED BLOOD, CHARLOTTE'S AND HER FATHER, A &quot;THEY KNEW THAT THESE KINDS FORMED WITH NATIVE WOMEN, MARRIAGES. THERE WERE NO MINISTERS CHURCH. THEY DIDN'T VIEW THEM AS &quot;THE FUR TRADE DOESN'T THOMPSON ALWAYS HE IS DEPENDING ON THEM. AND HE HAS A MIXED BLOOD ELSE DOES. &quot; BLOOD OF THESE PEOPLE, AND WELL EDUCATED IN THE GIVES ME A GREAT ADVANTAGE. &quot; RECOGNIZED THAT THESE THAT THEY NEEDED WERE GOING TO SURVIVE. &quot; TO TRADE WITH YOUR BROTHER THAN YOU ARE GOING TO A HAVE ANY KINSHIP TIES. &quot; IN FALL OF 1800, CHARLOTTE, ARRIVED AT THE POST, BUILT A YEAR FROM A STRING OF POSTS ON ALTHOUGH THE MOUNTAINS INTENTION WAS CLEAR. THE FUR TRADE WAS MOVING MOUNTAINS. THE NOR'WESTERS WANTED TO KOOTENAI, SIDE OF THE MOUNTAINS. &quot;THE KOOTENAI ARE THIS ONE OF THE FEW TRIBES CULTURE AND PLATEAU CULTURE KOOTENAI PEOPLE GO BACK AND THE KOOTENAI ARE AN ANCIENT COLUMBIA PLATEAU FOR &quot; OUR LANGUAGE IS AN KOOTENAI LANGUAGE, THERE IS FACE OF THE EARTH &quot;WE'RE ALL UPNUCKANICK, WE ARE UPNUCKANICK&quot; BLOOD AND BLACKFEET NORTHERN PLAINS. &quot;THE PIEGAN FOR GENERATIONS PROTECTING THEIR THEY ACTED AS MIDDLEMEN TRIBES WEST OF &quot; I WATCHED AS THEIR BEST HORSES AND DRESS KETTLES AND BROKEN TOOLS. PETER FIDLER, HUDSON'S &quot; THE PIEGAN AND THEIR BLOOD DIDN'T REALLY LIKE WANTED TO MOVE THROUGH THEM GROUPS LIKE THE SALISH THE TRIBES ON THE WEST &quot; THEY SEE EUROPEANS IN WERE ACCUSTOMED TO SEEING NECESSARILY AS FRIENDS OR THREATS, OR AS WHEN THE KOOTENAI TRIED TO EUROPEANS, THE PIEGAN STEAL THEIR HORSES. DAVID THOMPSON JOURNAL: NOT HELP BUT ADMIRE THOSE WHEN THE YOUNG PIEGAN MEN HORSES, THEY ALL ACTED BENT THEIR BOWS,. AND PREPARED TO MAKE HORSES OR SELL THE KOOTENAI WANTED THE FUR POST IN THEIR HOMELAND. ANXIOUS TO TAP THIS NEW WEST COMPANY DECIDED TO ACROSS THE ROCKIES IN 1806. THOMPSON, RECENTLY NAMED A PLACED IN CHARGE &quot;MR. DAVID THOMPSON PREPARATIONS FOR AN ATTEMPT TO PASS THROUGH THE COUNTRY RIVER TO THE SEA. .. JAMES BIRD, HUDSON'S THE COURSE WOULD FOLLOW AN THE SASKATCHEWAN, OVER KOOTENAI COUNTRY. IT'S TODAY'S HOWSE PASS. THOMPSON WAS NOW 36, CHILDREN UNDER THIS EXPEDITION WAS AN ADVANCE PARTY, LED BY TO IMPROVE THE KOOTENAI &quot;IT'S DESCRIBED AS BUT YET THERE'S ALREADY THERE'S PEOPLE BRINGING UP THEM SUPPLIED. IT'S THIS LONG STUTTERED MATERIALS AND WAITING GETTING THE GUIDES IT'S MUCH MORE LIKE EVEREST WHERE YOU HAVE BASE COMING UP AND YOU HAVE AREN'T GOING TO SUMMIT, BUT BY THE FIRST WEEK OF MAY, THE SASKATCHEWAN. EIGHT VOYAGEURS WERE TWO SEPARATE GROUPS ROCKIES. CLERK FINAN MCDONALD WITH UPSTREAM IN THEIR THOMPSON AND THE REMAINING WOODED FORESTS, LEADING CHARLOTTE AND THE CHILDREN, WITH TWO OTHER FAMILIES, OF CAMP DOGS. &quot;AND HIS CREW IS SO STEADY, THIS AFFINITY AND GET THIS THOMPSON. SO AGAIN, HE'S SORT OF THIS THOMPSON'S DAILY WEATHER HIS OPTIMISM &quot;A FINE DAY&quot;, &quot;A DAY WITH FLYING CLOUDS&quot; HAD A VERY EXTENSIVE VIEW HILLS AND ROCKS RISING ONE HIGHER TO THE SNOWY NEVER BEFORE DID I BEHOLD THE WAVES OF THE OCEAN FOLLOWING JOCKO FINLEY'S KOOTENAI TRAIL, THE CONTINENTAL DIVIDE,. WHICH THOMPSON CALLED &quot; THE ROCKIES ARE VERY A MOUNTAIN GUY. HE'S CUT HIS TEETH AND IT'S JUST SO HIGH MOUNTAINS. &quot; ARE NOW RUSHING DOWN WITH HARDLY PERSUADE OURSELVES IT AT LEAST EVERY HOUR. &quot; THE ROCKIES DURING SPRING THERE'S A LOT OF NOISE, COMING DOWN, THERE'S A LOT TO DO ANYTHING. EXCEPT STAND THERE THE TRAIL UP WAS RELATIVELY WEST SLOPE OF THE ROCKIES ALTOGETHER. DAVID THOMPSON: &quot;THE HORSES RECEIVED SUCH VIOLENT DEPRIVE THEM FOR DURING THE STEEP DESCENT, BACK AND FORTH ACROSS THE WILD WITH RUNOFF. &quot; AND HE'S GOT VOYAGEURS HOLDING ON TO HORSES MANES ABOUT BECAUSE NONE OF HE NEVER MENTIONS KIDS AGED 5, 3, AND 1. I MEAN IT'S REALLY HARD TO ACROSS WITHOUT &quot; THE DENSE TRAIL, POORLY HIS MEN THE SUMMER BEFORE, THOMPSON WAS HIS MEN EXHAUSTED. THOMPSON REPORT: &quot;THE ANY MORE THAN JUST TO TO SQUEEZE THROUGH IT WITH IS OF THE OPINION OF EVERY OUGHT TO LOSE AT IN LATE JUNE, THOMPSON'S THE COLUMBIA RIVER, NEAR &quot;HE HITS THE COLUMBIA AT A THE BLAEBERRY IT'S THIS WIDE VALLEY, SINCE THE HEADWATERS OF THE MILES BEFORE CURVING SOUTH, FOUND THE HIGHLY SOUGHT THE WEST TO A NORTHWEST PASSAGE. THOMPSON'S FIRST PRIORITY ESTABLISH TRADE. HE MOVED HIS PARTY SOUTH, KOOTENAI, BUT THEY WERE TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE, BIRCH BARK IS TOO THIN &quot;HE KNOWS THE RULES HAVE UNDERSTAND HOW. HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND &quot;CROSSING OVER THE ECOSYSTEM. IT'S TIED TO THE PACIFIC AS YOU'RE NOT DEALING WITH BISON OR THE THOMPSON JOURNALS: &quot;THE COUNTRY IS EXTREMELY LARGER THAN A CHEVERUIL, MOUTHS TO FEED&quot; LIVING ON THE PRAIRIE, AND 50 MILLION PRONG HORN SO HE HAS A VERY THOMPSON JOURNALS: THAT HOWEVER WILLING, STRENGTH TO WORK. &quot; SEE THOMPSON FLIPPED FROM INDIVIDUAL TO SOMEONE WHO ON A REGULAR BASIS. ALL OF A SUDDEN, NOW HE HAS THE STUDENT .&quot; A BAND OF KOOTENAI THOMPSON JOURNALS: LOOKS AND ASKING NO QUESTIONS, TO EAT, WHICH WAS MOST THOMPSON BUILT THE FIRST LAKES OF THE COLUMBIA, JUST HE NAMED IT KOOTENAI HOUSE.

MOST OF THE TRADE GOODS AWLS FOR PUNCHING HOLES, STARTING FIRES, COPPER BLANKETS AND LINEN SHIRTS. IN EARLY FALL, 1807, EXPLORE, OR WHAT HE CALLED, &quot;THE ELDERS THAT HE'S CAN'T GO. WELL, HE SAYS, WHY CAN'T I UGLY HEAD FOR HE'S THE SKILLS AND THE LANGUAGE SHOW YOU AROUND. I MEAN, YOU CAN'T JUST GO UGLY HEAD, IS A KOOTENAI HIS UNUSUAL HEAD &quot;THERE ARE ALL THESE DOORS THAT HAS ALL THE KEYS AND THAT HE WANTS TO. &quot; INFORMATION ON A PIECE BY AT A TIME, HE HAS TO EARN CHIEF UGLY HEAD AND HIS FIRST REAL &quot;DISCOVERY&quot; &quot; AND THEY START RIDING AND THEY RIDE ACROSS THE IS A ONE-MILE PORTAGE THAT RIVER, AND THOMPSON IS IT'S FABULOUSLY BEAUTIFUL THE ST. MARY'S RIVER, &quot;WELL I I WANT TO TAKE THIS SHORT CUT THERE, LET'S GO&quot;... AND HE POINTS TO THESE COVERED WITH SNOW AND SAYS WEEKS. THOMPSON IS INTIMIDATED BY HE'S WORRIED ABOUT AT KOOTENAI HOUSE BECAUSE BLACKFEET THAN KOOTENAIS THOMPSON RETURNED TO SPEND WEST SIDE OF THE MOUNTAINS &quot; BOTH CANADIANS AND INDIANS PASSED WHOLE NIGHTS WITH MY AT THE MOON AND STARS. I TOLD THEM IT WAS TO DIRECTION FROM THE PLACE I NEITHER THE CANADIANS NOR FOR BOTH ARGUED THAT IF OUGHT TO LOOK TO THE NOT TO THE STARS BUT HIS OWN FRENCH-CANADIAN HIM AND ASK HIM TO SOMEHOW RAISE A WIND FOR US, MAKE THEY ALL THOUGHT THAT WHAT OBSERVING THE SKIES WAS HAPPENING FAR AWAY, OR THOMPSON FOUND TIME TO WORK WINTER. HE'D DRAW NUMEROUS SMALL AND COMPASS COURSES FROM LATER THE CHARTS WERE FITTING TOGETHER LIKE THOMPSON'S FIRST YEAR WEST CLOSE TO BEING HIS LAST. THE SMALL NUMBER OF FURS COMMERCIAL VALUE THOMPSON, FRUSTRATED, PARTNERS SAYING THE COMMERCIAL LEVEL TRAPPING. &quot;TO HIM, HE WANTS EVERY PACKS OF FURS, THAT'S BEAVER, EVERY WINTER THEY CAN'T UNDERSTAND THAT. THAT'S ONE OF THOSE DON'T MAKE ANY SENSE. WHY WOULD YOU TRAP THE PLATEAU TRIBES DANCED AND SPIRITUALLY IN THE WINTER. &quot;HE IS ALWAYS GOING CRAZY IT'S WINTER, THE PELTS TRAPPING? AND THEY GO, OH WE CAN'T. WE HAVE TO SPIRITUALLY WHAT WE DO IN THE WINTER. WE WORK ALL YEAR SO THAT WE ARE IMPORTANT TO US. AND HE SEES THIS DEEP ESSENTIAL PART IN SPRING 1808, THOMPSON HIS SHORT TRIP OF THE SOUTH, DOWN STEAM ON THIS TIME, THOMPSON RODE RECORDING EACH SMALL ESTIMATING THE DISTANCE THE PARTY CROSSED THE 49TH NORTHWESTERN MONTANA. TO BRING IN MORE BEAVER RENDEZVOUS WITH A GROUP OF SOUTH TO OPEN TRADE WITH BUT WHEN HIS GUIDES DID NOT CONTINUED DOWNSTREAM ALONE, DANGEROUS PORTAGE 23 YEAR OLD DAN BLACKBURN, GREW UP ON THE &quot;WHEN I STARTED KAYAKING GO OVER KOOTENAI FALLS, COULD DO IT. IT'S A MILE AND A HALF OF TODAY, KOOTENAI FALL'S BY LIBBY DAM, IN MONTANA. BUT IN THOMPSON'S DAY THE MUCH STRONGER THREE HUNDRED FEET ABOVE ROCKS, BLACKBURN WITH A FALLS, FOLLOWING THE THOMPSON'S PARTY USED DAN BLACKBURN: THE SAME THINGS, IT'S A THINK BACK THAT FAR, PRETTY THOMPSON: MAY 6, 1808 ABOUT 300 FEET THE LEAST SLIP WOULD HAVE EACH MAN HAD TWO PAIRS OF WERE CUT TO PIECES. &quot; ARRIVED AT BONNER'S FERRY, UGLY HEAD'S PEOPLE.
