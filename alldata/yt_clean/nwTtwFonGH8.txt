Welcome to Yakutsk, the world's coldest city. My hometown. Here, winter temperatures drop to -64 degrees, just like on Mars. in this unique environment life doesn't stop, we carry on with our daily activities from heading to work to sending our kids to school but how do we stay fit and healthy in such an extreme climate? one of the most extraordinary methods to stay fit and healthy in yakuta is ice bathing at extreme weather today with temperatures around -40deg it's a relatively warm day in Yakutsk making it an ideal day for the local ice bathers known as the walruses to gather Nikolai, a master of this practice and the founding member of this tight-knit community, is a true superhuman. for over 50 years he has made ice bathing a daily ritual braving icy waters even at extremely lows of -58degC preparing the ice bath is the first step in their practice but it's no easy task with the water freezing immediately in such an extreme weather maintaining the ice bath requires lots of efforts and strength Nikolai who is Nikolai who is now 63 years old, lives a healthy life free from illness through his Ice bath practices and meditation techniques Nikolai has not only transformed his own life but has also become a guiding light for others seeking better physical and mental well-being, and even freedom from addiction. After the ice bath being prepared, the walruses are ready to start their practice. It's essential to keep their heads, hands, and feet warm to avoid frostbite as these body parts are most at risk. Locals typically start their ice bath practice in the summer and continue through the autumn, gradually adjusting to the temperatures. While ice bathing itself isn't dangerous, the real risk lies in the transition out of the water. Exposure to freezing temperatures can lead to hypothermia, frostbite, and even cardiac arrest if not managed properly. But, rather than rushing to get dressed, locals often engage in exercises after emerging from the ice water. Despite the extreme cold, ice bathing has great benefits. It improves blood circulation, strengthens the immune system reduces inflammation, and releases endorphins, leading to better mood and less stress. I didn't dare to try ice bathing this time, as I already felt very cold. Even with multiple layers of clothing, I could feel the chill coming deep into my bones, my cheeks were burning with cold, so I was constantly moving my body and I just can't believe how anyone could endure ice bathing in such extreme conditions! This is how we stay fit and healthy in Yakutia! You know, after practicing ice bathing, I don't have diabetes now! I don't have any epilepsy anymore! I stopped taking my blood pressure medications a long time ago! I have thrown them in the garbage! Alright, let's do it All my family will join me as well If you do ice bathing, you won't have any stroke or heart attacks Your life will be great In Yakutia, we do ice bathing even at -60degC (-76degF)! There is no one else in the world As the walruses were finishing their ice bathing practice I spotted another amazing sight: a man running in this freezing temperature! In Yakutia, ice running is another way to stay fit and healthy despite the bitter cold I go ice running almost every day Today, I ran for 2.5 hours That's really long! Don't you get frostbite? No It's very hot today This morning was very hot, I sweat a lot I even changed my clothing You're probably wondering why anyone would choose to run in such freezing temperatures Well, the truth is simple: we don't have the luxury of warm, sunny weather here So, we embrace what we've got, and people like Fedia, they just take it in stride Fedia runs for almost two hours every day to get ready for his big challenge: the upcoming ice marathon in Oymyakon next January This isn't just any race it's a grueling 42-kilometer journey in temperatures that can plunge below -70 degrees, making it the coldest marathon ever. My name is Fedya Okoneshnikov I've been practicing ice running for 5 years already I run 6 days a week What was the lowest temperature you have run in? At -44degC (-47degF) Wow, at -44degC? Yes You look like you're not dressed very warmly Yes, dressing lightly helps prevent sweating We wear regular running shoes And on top of it we wear socks So, it helps a little bit to prevent the cold wind Also, it's not slippery when wearing them I decided to join Fedia for a run, but running in this weather was a whole new experience for me, and it wasn't easy. With every breath, thick steam poured out of my mouth, and my cheeks and nose felt the cold burn. Running at 40 degrees below zero is definitely no joke! The biggest challenge I faced was breathing. Inhaling such cold air can be dangerous, risking damage to the lungs if not done correctly. Well, winter running definitely requires long adaptation, and a high motivation. oh my first experience to run outside it's really are freezing how is it burning inside While I've gotten used to the tough winters here, I haven't been brave enough to try things like ice bathing or marathon running.

For me, being active and working out isn't just about staying in shape. It also helps me deal with feeling down during the long, dark winter in Yakutia. Exercising makes me feel happier and keeps me going, even when it's really cold outside. As the temperature climbs to a &quot;warmer&quot; -30 degrees, it feels like a spring day for us here in Yakutia! We went on an amazing camping trip and stayed in a guesthouse right in front of the Lena Pillars. Spending time outdoors is not just enjoyable, but it also serves as a way to stay fit and healthy in the world's coldest city. While -30 degrees may still seem extreme to some, for us, it's a fantastic opportunity to spend time outdoors, grab our skis, and head out for some fun in the sun. Being in nature helps clear my mind, and I always feel amazing after being outdoors. The extreme cold of Yakutian winters brings its own kind of beauty: The way the snow blankets everything, turning the landscape into a winter wonderland and the fresh air makes you feel alive with every breath you take. Staying active really lifts my mood and boosts my energy levels. And I can feel how regular workouts with Copilot Fitness have made me tougher. I feel better, stronger, and happier - and it's just an amazing feeling. Staying so close to the magnificent Lena Pillars, we couldn't miss the chance to explore them up close. We bundled up in windproof jackets-- and they actually look pretty cool. We hopped on a snowmobile, cutting across nearly a kilometer of the icy Lena River to get there. Here in Yakutia, we often compare the Lena Pillars to the Wall from Game of Thrones. It's a must-visit for &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; fans, but honestly, it's a place everyone should see. These huge, natural rock towers are not just beautiful to look at but you can also feel a powerful, almost mystical energy that's difficult to describe. Even with the biting cold on our faces, the excitement of being in such a wild, untouched place made us incredibly happy. Moments like these, surrounded by the awe-inspiring beauty of the Lena Pillars, really drive home the grandeur and toughness of the natural world. After taking a short break, we decided to try something I'd never done before--ice fishing! Honestly, it was so much fun! Catching a fish for the first time was surprisingly awesome. I was really happy. It wasn't just catching fish; it was about being out in nature, away from the hustle and bustle of daily life, and just enjoying the simplicity of fishing and good company, was an incredible experience. It's these kinds of adventures that remind me how amazing it feels to connect with the natural world and with each other. yay The next morning, I woke up to the incredible sight of the Lena Pillars, but the harsh cold made staying inside more tempting. That's when I turned to my Copilot Fitness app for an indoor workout. I love that Copilot lets me exercise anytime, anywhere, without needing gym equipment. Being able to stick to my fitness routine, whether I'm at home or out in the wild, is great. With Copilot Fitness, I never feel alone in my fitness journey. The encouragement I receive from my coach helps me stay motivated and overcome the challenges of staying active during the colder month. Also, I've seen a big change in my eating habits since I started being more active and doing regular workouts I used to struggle with overeating, especially when bored or stressed. But now, after exercising, I naturally want healthier and just the right amount of food. This change in my eating habits happened naturally as I got more into my workouts. Feeling good after exercising made me want to keep up that positive vibe by choosing better food. Seeing my body get leaner and more toned from my own efforts has been so rewarding.
