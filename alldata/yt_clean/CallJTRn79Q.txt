- When I say the word, &quot;Stew,&quot; most people think of big pieces of beef cloaked in a rich gravy. But today, Becky's gonna show us how to make a hearty, but swap out the meat for mushrooms. - You're gonna love this one. - I can't wait. - So there's a few qualities that any starring component It should be inherently savory, it should have the ability - Mhm. - And it should have a nice balance of tenderness and resilience. So as the food cooks, it softens up, but it maintains its structural integrity. - Yeah. - And mushrooms check all those boxes. - They do and they have a beefy flavor, for lack of a better word. - They do, they do. So we're gonna make mushroom bourguignon. - Ooh! - Yeah, the famous stew - That's right, with a lot of red wine. - Oh, yes, there's gonna So of course, we're portobellos are perfect for this. They have a nice meaty so you can get that - Yep. - [Becky] So I'm just you don't need those - I'm gonna do a total of two and a half pounds of portobellos and you want to make sure they add really nice flavor and a really nice deep, dark color. So I'm gonna cut these into And these are already cleaned, if they were a little bit dirty, you could wipe 'em off So now we're gonna start cooking. So we'll do some medium high heat and then I have two tablespoons and a 1/4 cup of water. And I know, yeah, that when you're trying to build fond, but it is a good way to kind when you're trying to brown mushrooms. So we're gonna bring that All right, so you can are simmering there a little bit, so let's go ahead and And the pot is full, but like I said, these are And I'm gonna season and 1/4 teaspoon of pepper. Just give that a little stir. All right, so I'm going to put the lid on, we're gonna let these cook I'll stir them occasionally and we're gonna have all those juices start to come out of the mushrooms. - [Julia] Okay. - All right, it's been 10 minutes. Let's take a look at what's going on here. - [Julia] Wow, wow, - [Becky] Look at all that liquid that's come out, that's awesome. - [Julia] Mhm. - So we're gonna let this cook with the lid off and by that point, all this and we should have a nice dark fond on the bottom of the pot. - Okay, well, as Becky mentioned, adding water to the pot to seems counterintuitive, but only the part that's cooks and dries out, that's because mushrooms which acts as an insulator and prevents the pan's throughout the mushroom. If we add just a little the mushrooms cook all the way through, that's because now we're which readily carries heat so it cooks from all sides. The even heat helps and the denser mushrooms and that's why you add water. - [Becky] All right, it's You can see all the liquid is gone. - [Julia] Yeah. - These are are nicely cooked, Okay, now we have medium high heat, I'm going to put in two tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil that are sliced about 1/4 inch thick and a shallot that's chopped up. We're gonna cook these until they start to soften. Alright, these veggies are - [Julia] Mhm - Getting a little bit soft there. Now I'm gonna add four cloves We're just gonna let those go for about a minute till we start to get that nice garlicy aroma. All right, now I'm adding - [Julia] Mhm.

A cup of wine, you wanna - [Julia] Mhm. - We're using pinot noir, that's the signature wine of burgundy. - [Julia] That is. - Let's start building I've got two tablespoons of soy sauce, tablespoon of tomato paste, and then miso.
