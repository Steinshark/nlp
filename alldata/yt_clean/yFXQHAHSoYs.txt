[Music] Is it him? We're unsure, Lord Vader. One of the X-wings is utilizing an R2 unit very similar to that of Skywalker. At the very least they're conspiring with him. Leave them to me... [Music] Why don't they just send us to take [Laughs] Must be really important if he's dusting off the X1. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Break right! Break right! The beacon isn't going out. They're scrambling our coms. I can't shake him! We're going to have to jump to hyperspace. They've got the lanes blocked by the [Scoffs] Yeah, I'm sure he'll wait. [Music] I'm hit! I'm hit! Life support systems are damaged. We have no choice...jump to hyerspace! Damn! My hyperdrive is disabled...Go without me. [Sad Droid noises] No... I'll distract them while you go. I can at least give you a chance. It's been an honor. The honor has been mine. Thank you. Get out of here! May the force be with you... [Darth Vader Breathing] [Music] [Inaudible] [Music] This is not the hero of the Rebellion. [Music] The pilot may have survived...At least for now. [Music] [Music] [Music] Shall I send a team to eliminate the pilot? No need. The pilot is no longer of any concern to us. Admiral Montfarret...The rebels have been destroyed. Affirmative. The Emperor will be pleased. Skywalker was not among them. Understood, my Lord. [Children crying] Dispose of them. [Music] [Music] [Vader Breathing] This place is strong in the Light Side of the Force. [Music] [Music] What is this? You've fallen. You were supposed to bring balance. There is no balance. Anakin Skywalker. Your hatred has caused too much pain. You destroy lives. You destroy hope. You've betrayed the Jedi. The Jedi were corrupt, manipulative liars. And what are you? I am security and order. [Ignites saber] I killed you and destroyed whatever traces of you I had within me. You will never get rid of me. Your ignorance of the There is knowledge and Peace is a lie. There is only passion! And through my passion I gain strength. And through my strength is where I gain true power. There is no passion, there is serenity. There is no chaos, there is harmony. Through power I gain victory! There is no death... There is the Force. Strange...Lord Vader isn't turning up on our scanners. You are as weak as I remember. Always being held back. You never learned that restraint is true power. You never learned the power of the Dark Side! I have been with you all along. I have never to kill me. But I cannot be killed. I am part of you: The Light Within. Qui-Gon saw it. Obi-wan saw it. Padme saw it. Stop! [Padme] I don't know you anymore... You're breaking my heart. [Obi-Wan] You were my brother, Anakin! I loved you! [Obi-Wan] You were the Chosen One! You have become the pain you've tried to rid the Galaxy of. You've become the corruption you've fought so hard to overthrow. You've become the nightmare... that kept you scared as a child. The living Force resides in you...even now. I have embraced the Dark Side. I cannot be redeemed. You can! Your son sees me, and I will reach out to him. I will never return to the Light. Then you are lost. [Music] [Music] What is thy bidding, my Master? Excellent work destroying the Rebel pilots. Though Skywalker was not among them had they made it back to their Yes, my Master. Hm...There is a shroud around you. The Force is strong, but I sense there is conflict in you. My only thoughts are to serve you, further the expansion of the Empire, and destroyed the remaining Rebellion. I shall remind you now, my Apprentice: The Dark Side allows me to see a great many things, including the conflict within you. Anakin Skywalker is dead, but I sense the ghost of him lingers inside you. But he will remain as he has been: a fleeting memory. Yes, Master. I killed him long ago. See to it that he remains dead!
