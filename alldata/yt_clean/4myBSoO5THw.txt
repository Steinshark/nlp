Hi! Today, we're staying at the oldest hot spring in Izu. We're taking a collaboration train to Shuzenji Station in Shizuoka Prefecture. It seems to be related to an anime called &quot;Genjitsu-no-Yohane.&quot; It takes about 2 hours and 40 minutes by train from Tokyo Station to Shuzenji Station. We're riding the Izu Hakone Railway Sunzu Line, a local train. It's kind of like being in a game. We've arrived at Shuzenji Station. It's the season of autumn leaves in Japan. From platform 5, we'll take a bus to &quot;Yoshina Onsen-guchi.&quot; You can use a transportation IC card The bus ride from Shuzenji Station to the &quot;Yoshina Onsen-guchi&quot; stop takes about 20 minutes. With buses running only once or twice an hour, it's best to check the schedule in advance. Pressed the button before anyone else. We've arrived at the bus stop. Thank you. What a beautiful view! And the weather is great. Near the bus stop, there's a waiting room with the inn's sign. After arriving here, call the inn and they'll send a staff member to pick us up by car. 5 minutes later... The inn's car has come to pick us up. Thank you. Looking forward to our stay. It's about a 3-minute car ride from the bus stop to the inn. Oh, we've already arrived. Walking from the bus stop to the inn takes about 20 minutes. Walking's possible, but the inn has many areas to explore, so a pick-up is recommended. &gt;&gt; Staff: Welcome, you must be tired. The entrance is beautiful with the autumn leaves! How lovely. This place is a historic inn with 400 years of history, reopened after renovations in Autumn 2010. This &quot;Yoshina Onsen,&quot; renowned as Izu's oldest onsen, is among many famous hot springs here. Wow. The front desk. A lovely blend of Japanese and modern style. Cool ceiling. Souvenir shop. Merry Christmas! &gt;&gt; Landlady: This river is called Yoshina River. &gt;&gt; Landlady: Upstream, there's even a wasabi farm. Isn't the water in the river so clean? &gt;&gt; Landlady: You may even see many fish swimming around, such as horse mackerel and trout. &gt;&gt; Landlady: We'll enter the main building from here. &gt;&gt; Landlady: Straight ahead, there are separate indoor baths for men and women. &gt;&gt; Landlady: Below here, there's a paid spa. &gt;&gt; Landlady: We also have a shop, so please feel free to visit it. &gt;&gt; Landlady: Today, we have prepared a room for you in the West Wing. &gt;&gt; Landlady: We'll take the elevator to get there. &gt;&gt; Landlady: The restaurant is on the right of the front terrace. &gt;&gt; Landlady: We have prepared your dinner and breakfast there. &gt;&gt; Landlady: Please, this way. &gt;&gt; Landlady: This way to the West Wing. &gt;&gt; Landlady: We have prepared the room named &quot;Suigetsu&quot; for you. &gt;&gt; Landlady: Please be aware, it's not an auto-lock door. &gt;&gt; Landlady: We have provided two keys for your room. &gt;&gt; Landlady: Let me show you around inside the room. &gt;&gt; Landlady: This is the closet. &gt;&gt; Landlady: Here are pajamas. &gt;&gt; Landlady: We have prepared baskets like this. &gt;&gt; Landlady: Please take them with you when you go for a walk. &gt;&gt; Landlady: Here are yukatas. For women, we have medium and small sizes. &gt;&gt; Landlady: For men, we provide medium and large sizes. &gt;&gt; Landlady: Please check the size for your back. &gt;&gt; Landlady: This is the coffee machine. &gt;&gt; Landlady: Please use the kettle or coffee machine separately, not at the same time. &gt;&gt; Landlady: A refrigerator is available here for your use. &gt;&gt; Landlady: Enjoy the complimentary items in the fridge. &gt;&gt; Landlady: We include our original water. &gt;&gt; Landlady: Ice water and ice are also available. &gt;&gt; Landlady: And over here, we have an open-air bath. &gt;&gt; Landlady: This bath is sourced directly from the hot spring. &gt;&gt; Landlady: There is no circulation or heating system in the bath. &gt;&gt; Landlady: When you use it, please remove the lid. &gt;&gt; Landlady: Towels, bath towels, and a bath mat are prepared here. &gt;&gt; Landlady: If you need more, please don't hesitate to ask. Thank you, kind Landlady, for showing us around. The room, a blend of Japanese and Western styles, is very nice. The tatami area has a table, floor chairs, and a TV. In the Western-style area, there's a bed, a sofa, and a TV. And this large window is so impressive. At this time of year, we can see the beautiful autumn leaves and the river. It's a bit chilly outside today. But the room is warm thanks to the efficient heating. This inn is quite spacious. Let's go see the shared areas. Having two room keys is convenient, as we can each carry one. There are umbrellas. No worries if it rains. The inn offers separate indoor and open-air baths for both genders, plus two private baths. Near our room, there's a private bath and an open-air bath. The open-air bath is available without reservation, so let's check it out. (Special filming permission granted.) The changing room. It's very clean and well-stocked with amenities and hair dryers. And then, the onsen! There are several showers, and it's spacious. The water is an alkaline simple spring, odorless and clear. Historically, it's said that bathing in this hot spring water blesses one with fertility, as per the legend. Here's another open-air bath, btw. It's very beautiful and open. The hot spring was very gentle and warmed us from the core. Good. The garden on the floor below our room embodies wabi-sabi. The inn is a bit complex, so it's easy to get lost. But everything is so beautifully Japanese, it's fun to walk around. The outside grounds are also extensive, like a park, making for enjoyable walks. This bridge over the Yoshina River was built in 1925. The thatched roof of the restaurant in the back right is cool. There's a vintage car, a Ford Model A. Over here, there are gardens, a museum, and guest rooms. The grounds are so spacious. The gentle slopes are just right for a leisurely walk. Deeper inside, we find a Japanese house reserved as a lounge for guests. Before the renovation, this building was a hidden hot spring inn. The lounge captures a nostalgic Japanese atmosphere from around the 1920s. It's like an old-fashioned coffee shop, with a very good retro vibe. There are plenty of seats, so you can relax comfortably. And you can enjoy drinks and snacks for free. Honey rusk. Looks good! Apple juice, plum juice, oolong tea, and more. There's even alcohol available. Being able to drink draft beer from a chilled glass is fantastic. There's also sparkling wine, white wine, and red wine. Such a luxurious and adult-oriented stay. Very nice. The path continues even further back. It might be a bit challenging if it's raining. In the back, there are detached suite-type rooms. These are especially popular rooms, but this time we got a special peek inside. Villa Suite Maisonette: From 46,500 yen (322.08 USD / EUR 293.70) per person. A warm and cozy maisonette-style Western room. I wonder what the second floor is like. There are two beds. A sofa and TV are also available, making it a relaxing space. A washbasin in the back. The toilet is hidden, but can you spot where it is? And there's an open and inviting terrace. Plus the hot spring! A healing open-air bath overlooking a bamboo grove. By the river, enjoy the soothing sounds of flowing water. The legend behind Yoshina Onsen, Izu's oldest hot spring, as a 'fertility hot spring' goes like this. &quot;Oman no Kata,&quot; favored by warlord Tokugawa Ieyasu, bathed here seeking fertility. Later, she bore two children, linking this hot spring to fertility. This is Oman's Garden, where a statue of Oman no Kata stands. There are tables and sofas, so you can relax here. Ah, there's the statue of Oman no Kata. It's said to be crafted to resemble her real appearance. It's great to visit such a nature-rich inn during the short season of autumn leaves. It's getting cold. Let's head back to our room. For both men and women, yukatas come with jackets, ensuring a warm and comfortable experience. The washroom is fully equipped with a hairdryer and amenities. Cotton buds. Shower caps. Cotton pads. Shaving kits. Hairbands. Two types of body towels. Cotton and nylon, maybe? Foaming net. Hairbrush. Comb. Toothbrush and toothpaste. There are also individually packaged skincare sets. Now, let's take a bath. The water pressure is great. Ouch, hot!! Need to cool it down a bit. Let's stir the water with a stick. Okay, let's get in. Wow... So hot! But it feels good... There's no window glass. The evening lights are beautiful. It's the ultimate relaxation time without any disturbance. Feeling very luxurious. Warmed to the core and feeling cozy. Heading to the refrigerator. I'll have a beer, and my husband opts for Pocari Sweat. No extra charge for drinks in the room. On the table, there's Izu's famous wild boar-shaped monaka! Wow, it's really shaped like a wild boar. Crispy monaka filled with plenty of red bean paste. The TV is quite large. We can watch local programs. The free Wi-Fi works well. Let's go for dinner. We'll be dining at the Kaiseki restaurant &quot;Suion.&quot; This inn is part of the same group as a Izu resort hotel where we stayed before. The food there was nice, so we're looking forward to tonight's meal. &gt;&gt; Staff: Welcome, good evening. &gt;&gt; Staff: May I ask for your room number? &gt;&gt; Staff: I'll guide you to your table. This place also seems to be a renovated building with history, making it a very atmospheric. Tonight, we're having a course meal in a private room. Here's the drink menu. There's a variety of options like wine, cocktails, and soft drinks. Especially, they have a wide selection of Japanese sake. We ordered the inn's original sake and mandarin orange juice. Wow, it's so beautiful! Feels like autumn. &gt;&gt; Staff: Here are today's appetizers. &gt;&gt; Staff: For the lobster, we have sea urchin gratin. &gt;&gt; Staff: It's prepared with a blend of white sauce and sea urchin paste, then baked. &gt;&gt; Staff: Please feel free to start with whatever you like. Let's eat. The leaves are real, so they're not edible. This was incredibly good! Plump shrimp and rich sea urchin pair well, enhancing the sake's flavor. &gt;&gt; Staff: The soup is prepared in a grated radish style. &gt;&gt; Staff: Please enjoy it while it's warm. The main is a plump kinmedai! &gt;&gt; Staff: Next is sashimi, starting with button shrimp... &gt;&gt; Staff: followed by sea bream cured with kelp and two types of tuna. &gt;&gt; Staff: The fish topped with skin is Spanish mackerel. &gt;&gt; Staff: While ponzu pairs well with sea bream, mackerel, and shrimp... &gt;&gt; Staff: they are also delicious with salt, which pairs well with the sake you are enjoying. Here's the tuna. Although there's ponzu, salt, and soy sauce, I tried it with soy sauce. I had the button shrimp with salt, as recommended. Enhancing the shrimp's sweetness. So good. &gt;&gt; Staff: Next, we have Ashitaka beef pot. &gt;&gt; Staff: Located near Numazu is Mount Ashitaka. &gt;&gt; Staff: And we've prepared a stew using beef raised at the foot of this mountain. Crispy pea sprouts. So tender that it falls apart with chopsticks, and very good. The soup, a blend of beef and bonito broth, is rich and heartwarming... &gt;&gt; Staff: As a seasonal dish... &gt;&gt; Staff: since it's December, we are serving buri-daikon. It looks autumnal and beautiful. &gt;&gt; Staff: For the side dish... &gt;&gt; Staff: we have grilled miso eggplant. There's trout. The eggplant, including the skin, is edible. &gt;&gt; Staff: This is &quot;Izu-no-Megumi,&quot; original rice from Izu. &gt;&gt; Staff: This rice is known for its natural gloss... &gt;&gt; Staff: and a chewy texture, similar to glutinous rice. Pickles, grated yam, and miso soup have also arrived. Tiny quail eggs - so small and cute. A thoroughly satisfying meal. Even full, there's always room for dessert. &gt;&gt; Staff: For dessert... &gt;&gt; Staff: we have a sweet potato pudding. &gt;&gt; Staff: Warm red bean soup. &gt;&gt; Staff: And we've prepared chestnut ice cream for you. &gt;&gt; Staff: Please enjoy whichever you prefer first. I love autumn-exclusive sweets like sweet potatoes and chestnuts. Oops... oh, it's slipping... OK. It was delicious from start to finish. Leftover rice became onigiri, and they prepared tea scones for our night snack. Thanks! My stomach is full. Thank you for the meal! Let's go to the terrace since it's beautiful. The lighting makes the autumn leaves visible and stunning even at night. Looking at the restaurant from outside. It's pretty cool. The fire is real. Let's go to the private open-air bath. One of the two reservation-only private baths is near the front desk. How does everyone plan to spend Christmas? The private baths are reservation-based and free. We inquired at the front desk and were lucky it was available, so we could use it right away. With so many types of baths, it's a hot spring paradise. The changing room is clean and well-equipped. Towels are provided in each bath area. Shower stalls equipped with shampoo and other amenities. And then the hot spring. It's a large rock bath. This water temperature is the best. The view is a soothing bamboo forest. Let's go to bed soon. A convenient outlet by the pillow. The mattress is fluffy. Good night. Good morning. The sign says, &quot;About 1.3 km to Fujimi Plateau.&quot; A 40-minute hike from here leads to a spot with Mount Fuji views. Hmm... This time, let's be content with a photo of the sign. We'll have breakfast at the same restaurant where we had dinner last night. There's an option for Western breakfast, but we chose Japanese. So many side dishes and they look good. In the box, there's grilled seaweed. With charcoal underneath to keep it warm. Let's eat. Refillable rice, miso soup, and seaweed. Be mindful of overeating. There's kinmedai grilled in Saikyo miso and a vegetable stew, among others. Lots of ingredients from Shizuoka. After the meal, you can choose between tea or coffee. For dessert, yogurt with Izu's New Summer Orange jam. Thank you for the meal! In the room, there's illy, an Italian coffee, and luxury tea bags from TWG, originating in Singapore. The usual checkout time is 11 AM, but with a late checkout, you can stay until 12 PM. So, let's relax again in the private open-air bath in our room. The scenery and hot springs are always enchanting. Our plan, with two meals, is 45,500 yen (316.19 USD / EUR 288.22) per person. We found another wonderful inn. Thank you very much. For lunch, we head to the footbath cafe located on the inn's grounds. A bakery with a pool? The combination of orange and blue colors. Towels are nearby, so you can easily enjoy the footbath. It's not too hot, actually a bit tepid. Feels nice. &gt;&gt; Snowman: Thank you for watching up to this point! Please subscribe to our channel! And if you like it, please thumbs up. See you next time.
