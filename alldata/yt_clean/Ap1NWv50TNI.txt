- How's it going, everybody? Thank you for coming out tonight. It is good to be here. It is good to be back. Now that COVID's over, it was a weird time for everybody. But as you can imagine, a comedian who spends most it was a very strange time for me. I live in Cincinnati, Ohio, I remember I would get and I'd see my buddies in and they'd be in their It's literal lockdown, and every day they'd say the same thing. &quot;I just want this to be over, so comedy can come back,&quot; and I can see people again. 'Cause that's what comedy does. It lets us see people, you know. But I'm married with two kids, so I wanted comedy to come back for a completely different reason than they did. I was ready to not see And the first club that reached out was actually the club in Cleveland. And they said, &quot;Hey, we're What do you think about coming up?&quot; And I said, &quot;Sounds great. I can't wait, I'll see you soon.&quot; And they're like, &quot;We haven't I was like, &quot;I don't care when it is. I'll be there, all right?&quot; And they're like, &quot;All right, And I said, &quot;I'll give you spend the night in a hotel by myself.&quot; And I tried to do things other to keep the rust off. I did stand up at a I hated it, they hated it. I mean, they're trying to watch a movie. But I was like, &quot;listen, It's good to be here, man. I know every comic you've ever seen says it's good to be This is a good gig. And I know, 'cause I've I've done standup dressed like an umpire during a Minor League Baseball game. That is a terrible gig. See, I've been doing this 25 years, okay? And six months in, I didn't know there's jobs So when the woman from the came up to me after a show and said, &quot;How would you like to play in I was like, &quot; I've been Of course I'm ready for it.&quot; So I drive up to Dayton where it was a beautiful absolutely packed. They give me my umpire uniform, which was two sizes too small. Not a good look on me, okay? And I realized that when this guy said, &quot;Hey, your chest protector's on funny.&quot; I was like, &quot;I'm not This is a medium. And I started to get nervous I go, &quot;Hey, man, what happens as as it's about to?&quot; And he goes, &quot;Look, I was a and the National Football I know what fear is. This is nothing. You're gonna go out there, you're gonna have a good time. If anything goes wrong, I'll come out and save you. Those people love me. I'm the one who throws 'em free T-shirts when I run around with the mascot.&quot; I was like, &quot;All right, thank you. I appreciate that.&quot; So it's the fourth inning. I'm supposed to go out there Well, in the bottom of the fourth, there's a close play at home plate and the umpire makes a horrible call and gets into an argument with the Dragon star player and proceeds to throw him out of the game. Then the Dragon's and he gets tossed. Now we have 10,000 people booing the man. I'm going to pretend to to try to get some laughs. The guy was like, &quot;Hey man, you wanna I was like, &quot;I'd like to wait a couple games, if that's okay.&quot; He's like, &quot;Look, man, if we can't pay you.&quot; I was like, &quot;All right, let's So fast forward to now, The inning ends, the umpire walks down into the dugout. I put the mask on, they &quot;Tonight's umpire is and he's gonna do his act for you.&quot; I step out onto the field, &quot;Boo, boo!&quot; I get to home plate, I start doing my material, okay? And they hate it. But by the end of the material, I feel like they're listening. They're not laughing, but And now I have to decide, &quot;Do I wanna finish with some dignity or just fly this plane So I had been making fun of people who go to the flea market, okay? And I say, &quot;Are there any &quot;Yeah.&quot; I wouldn't be like, &quot;NASCAR Boo! Hot dogs, pretzels, anything you can throw is just hitting me from every direction as I stand there smiling behind the mask, because I can't fully explain it, but there's something exhilarating about feeling pure, unfiltered hatred from that many people at one time. But also, this has not gone well, right? This has not gone the And I don't know how when I see that guy jog out of the dugout and start jogging towards home plate. And I'm like, &quot;Oh, great. He's gonna come and tell And he doesn't slow down. In fact, he picks up speed I mean, just levels me. Now I'm laying on home I am not quite sure what's happened. Pretty sure I've sustained a spinal injury and 10,000 people could not They're losing their minds while this guy just parades soaking it in, right? So then he picks me up like Just tosses me over his shoulder. Then he grabs the mic up off the ground. He's like, &quot;Dragon fans, I'll &quot;Yeah!&quot; So I'm flopped over his shoulder. As he's carrying me to dugout, wind completely knocked outta my system. So right in his ear, I'm going. We get back underground. He's like, &quot;That was crazy.&quot; I was like, &quot;That's insane. What just happened?&quot; He goes, &quot;Were you crying out there?&quot; I was like, &quot;Crying? No, I wasn't crying. I didn't think I was I can't believe I did this for $35.&quot; So, yeah, it's good to be here. - Yeah! - Listen. I just like having my own I like to do whatever I want. And I get that when I'm on the road. I don't get that when I'm at home. If it's a family trip, I Not long ago we went to Amish country. I don't know if anybody's but that place sucks. It is terrible. Not fun at... You know what I didn't like? I'll tell you what I didn't like. The people. I didn't like the people. I found them to be very 'Cause they're like, &quot;We but we'll use it if we need And I don't like that attitude. And I told him. I said, &quot;Go big or go home, Ezekiel. Don't plug up, dude. It's a slippery slope.&quot; And he didn't like me, you know, probably 'cause his name wasn't Ezekiel and I kept trying to guess what it was. I was like, &quot;Abraham!&quot; &quot;No?&quot; &quot;Jodi?&quot; &quot;All right, I'll stop.&quot; The only reason I agreed was if I was allowed to take pictures and document the whole And the first time I took a picture, I get scolded by this Amish guy. He's like, &quot;Sir, we would appreciate if you're going to take pictures, you didn't take 'em of us.&quot; And I said, &quot;Why is that?&quot; He goes, &quot;Pictures give We don't like to do things I'm like, &quot;You're charging without any chairs to go with it. I'm pretty sure you're proud Why don't you worry about 'cause you look silly. I don't care how good your pretzels are. I'm never coming back here again. Are you kidding me? Not proud, really?&quot; Why don't you tell me for the fifth time how you put that barn up in one day? Okay, I don't need this. I left a musk scathing Yelp review. I never heard back from a manager. Last year for spring break, - Yeah. If you've never been, let me Gatlinburg is an American Indian word. It means land of the couples that were matching airbrush T-shirts. I don't know if that's accurate, but it's accurate. And they always pick the same design too. This is what it looks like. It's a silhouette of than the people who are And on the shirt, this couple, they're holding hands. They're in love, you guys. Their feet are in the sand, they're under a palm tree, there's a rainbow sunset on what is clearly the Then they just write so that you know which of the that they visited, right? They're just... They're not smart people. But it's great for people-watching. If you like the people watch, this is your spot, okay? I don't know if you enjoy it or not, but, man, there's no better hobby. It's free. You know, you just sit and talk about the trash walking by for a couple hours, right? Gatlinburg is prime pickens. I mean, there's not that much white trash in a dumpster behind you know what I'm saying? Like, it's special. I love people-watching so much. I take pictures when I do it like their baseball cards. Now, if you're into something like that, let me just give you a tip. Make sure that the flash are turned off, which I know sounds like a no-brainer. Guys. I've been doing this a long time. I messed up bad. I'm in line for security at the airport. I'm going this way, coming at me. He's a gentleman. Hawaiian shirt, shaved face. But outta the top of I don't know the right... A tuft. It was the brightest, whitest, busiest chest hair I've And I've been to Sarasota. This was next level, dude. It was teased, possibly bleached. He looked like a Build-A-Bear to send a message to the other 'cause numbers are down, right? And I knew if I didn't I wasn't gonna be able But here's the rub. I couldn't do it from this No one's gonna see how awesome it is. If I want some likes, I gotta time it so that I can get that side view, you know, the profile. So to do that, I have a face I make. It's very simple. The only thing I'm trying &quot;What? I'm just checking Twitter,&quot; even though my phone's kind of pointed in your general direction. He stops right here. I hit the button. It's like, flash. I was like. &quot;There's a Pokemon on your shoulder, sir. Just hold on. We'll get it.&quot; Just be careful, okay? The other tip, if you're gonna take pictures is to make sure that you have 'cause that's what happened when I went to go, people-watching. I was at my favorite spot to do it there, which is the old fashioned candy kitchen. I love that place, 'cause no matter what you're gonna see the same thing. There's gonna be a hillbilly who can't figure out on the other side of the window, and it's the greatest day of their life. They're just like, &quot;What? No-uh. Hey, come look. Come look. That's where they make it, the taffy, for Cracker Barrel. Yes, right here.&quot; I don't know how they do it, even though I can see the whole process. This is... I saw her standing there a block away, the Mickey Mantle rookie I got so excited, I was like, &quot;I've heard about you.&quot; &quot;Oh, you are coming home with me. Easy girl, easy girl. I'm not gonna hurt you.&quot; I got close enough to take the picture, press the button, just What? No. I scared her. She ran back in to , please believe it or not. Believe it or not. And I just sat down on in between the pancake pantry I'm so mad, you know. All this time, I tracked her. I just let her get away. I wish I could pull up a picture so you could see how awesome she was. But I can't, 'cause I was careless. So, I'll just describe her as best I can. She had early 1990s hair. You remember that look? Pulled back tight in a ponytail. But in the front, . In today's news... That thing I think defied all I always wondered how 'cause I always only ever and then I showed up too And there she was in So that was that lady's hair, okay? She's so perfect. She looked like someone at Long John Silvers/Kentucky the two-in-one fast food restaurant. You ever go to one of those places? Another great spot for people-watching. I don't know what it is, but the average redneck that there are two businesses and sharing the menu space above. And the first time they see it, it just catches 'em off guard. They're like, &quot;Okay, can I get... Okay, what happened here? Am I in a food court? Like, what... I want chicken. I can order from both of 'em. It's the same company. Oh, I didn't... okay. I just... Wow, okay, while I'm I get two sides. Could I get a side from this side and then a side from that side? I can? Okay, well, extra biscuits. I knew that before I came in here. And these Long John Ooh, can I do that? Two breads? I can? Oh, yeah, let's go that.&quot; And I was wondering like, &quot;What is the big thing here?&quot; you know? 'Cause I know that you think I'm joking just for the sake of doing comedy. I'm not, okay? Sit by the register in one of these two-in-one 10 minutes tops, you'll hear a sentence that has never been formed It's 'cause there's too many options and people aren't prepared. And they get up there, and then a line forms behind them, and they get nervous and they're like, &quot;Oh, do green beans go with tacos? Like, I don't even know It's the best. It really is the best. If you're gonna do it, just make sure half of wherever 'cause that is the place At any Long John Silvers, you will hear a grown which I feel is just a If you don't know what I'm talking about, Long John Silvers is a fast And what they do is they and they dip it in a batter, and then they put it in the fryer. And when they flip it out of the fryer, little pieces of that batter break off, and then a pile of all and then people go, &quot;Hey, man, can I get a scoop of the stuff that thing's been laying on?&quot; Put some of that in my treasure chest. And when I heard it, I was like, &quot;Did that guy just ask for more crumbs?&quot; She pushes a button on the register, boop, &quot;Crumbs, 10 cents.&quot; I was like, &quot;You gotta be kidding me.&quot; &quot;What?&quot; &quot;How often does this happen?&quot; I mean, I thought I could be witnessing the first time in the where some guy's, like, &quot;I'm so embarrassed to tell you this, but I'm a little short on cash, I got a long drive ahead of me. I'm so hungry. Could you just, I don't know, put some of that stuff into a cup. I could snack on it.&quot; No, no. It happens so much, it has been programmed into the register. Think about that. If whatever you want to call which I'm pretty sure we'll all agree was not in their original business plan, that tells me there was a At some long John Silver somewhere, something happened to And as a people watcher, I'm just sad I wasn't there to see it. 'Cause I pictured it in my Some toothless manager just &quot;Hey, somebody's gonna have to start paying for these crunchies, all right? I can't be giving this stuff away.&quot; &quot;I mean, if everybody's gonna ask for it, we gotta figure something out, all right?&quot; &quot;I don't know how to make it. It's an accident.&quot; &quot;Y'all just love free stuff. That's why we got rid and switched to packets. Two per customer. Y'all were just pumping Nobody needs that much tartar sauce. Nobody. I'm sick of it.&quot; And he tries to slam that door, but it's a metal kitchen door, right? Now you can just hear 'em in the back. &quot;I ain't settling down, Ricky. I'm sick of this. They don't pay me to put up with it. I'm so mad my hand shaking. I'm supposed to bowl tonight. Now what? I'm done. I said it before, but I mean it this time. I'm done. You watch. As soon as I can afford that lift kit and Luke Bryan tickets, you ain't ever going to see me again. I'm out.&quot; &quot;Well, of course I'm going. Florida-Georgia line's opening. I ain't gonna miss that show.&quot; &quot;They're the only two dudes that even settle me down right now.&quot; &quot;You do that? All right, well then you You make me wanna roll my window Look, you're kind. You're very kind. All we just learned is that about an incident at a Long John Silvers that probably never happened. It's just I'm obsessed. I just have so many I do. I think it's run by potheads, I'll say it. I think that's how they They get together, they get baked. They're like, &quot;Carl, what do you got?&quot; He's like, &quot;There have where I was like, I want fried chicken and but I was not capable of driving &quot;That's a great idea, Carl. We could put both of them in here. Two-in-one, cut the rent in half. I love it.&quot; &quot;Yes, Ricky, I've always wanted to make &quot;That's what I'm talking about. That might be the best idea to ever come out of one of these summits.&quot; Taco Bell is amazing. You guys like Taco Bell? - Yeah. - Yeah? That's a very polarizing restaurant. No one's ever on the You just say it and people are like, &quot;Absolutely&quot; or &quot;Hard pass,&quot; which is a constipation I respect Taco Bell 'cause they know what I just said. They know if you're gonna eat You ever seen a commercial for Taco Bell? Never makes sense. Doesn't have to. Doesn't affect the bottom line. They'll put out a product that has the exact same ingredients as six other products They just change the name or shape of it and try to make you feel dumb They're like, &quot;You've never had this. This is seasoned steak, lettuce, cheese, tomatoes and sour cream encased How does that sound?&quot; I mean, it sounds like a steak burrito. &quot;Well, it's not.&quot; &quot;One more time for the new guy. All right, steak burrito. See it right here? It's rolled up. Big deal. This, guys, what we did and we press it with a t-shirt iron. What is so hard to understand about the technology we've They make up food names. Like, those things don't exist. There's no such thing as a crunch wrap. Their dessert menu is a joke. They just take other and change it a little bit. They're like, &quot;We're the only ones that &quot;Isn't that just a cut up Cinnabon?&quot; &quot;I mean, yeah, but we You can say, gracias.&quot; &quot;Is there like a cool container you're gonna serve them to me in?&quot; &quot;No, man, it's just a drink cup but we gave it a Slurpee lid trying to get the ones off the bottom. So, denada&quot; I remember several years ago, the Hostess company went bankrupt. And then a month later, an unknown entity saved I thought for sure it was Taco Bell. I was... I was waiting on that &quot;It's the Twinkie Burrito. We have stuffed a Twinkie Some people are like, &quot;Ew.&quot; Hotheads are like, &quot;Absolutely.&quot; &quot;Sir, would you like Twinkie &quot;I don't care if it's coffee cream. I would just like my Twinkie Burrito, some fire sauce, two hoho lupas, and a Mountain Dew. I would like the Baja.&quot; Guys, we got an obesity And I know you're like, &quot;Is this dude about to while using his stomach as an armrest?&quot; And the answer is, yes. It's not that funny, lady, all right? Just relax. Thought I could fool They sell these to anybody. You don't even have to be a runner. My weight's gone up and I blame the BOOK IT! Program. If you don't know what When I was in elementary school, Pizza Hut decided that the best way to solve was to offer children a if they read four books or told their teacher And I mean, it was awesome You got pizza for doing homework. But 30 years later, nobody's making you read books and you're hooked on pizza. That's kind of what I'm I knew I had to drop some where I thought people were all the time. Whether they were or not, that's just where my head was. Like, when the Delta flight attendant asked me to switch seats to balance out a Canada Air regional jet, that'll ruin your day real quick, okay? 'Cause if I think about it, it's not me. It's where I'm sitting versus where there's too many empty seats. But if you're self-conscious that's not what you hear. What you hear is, &quot;Sir, if you move 10 feet that way, the whole plane will fly properly. Could you help us out?&quot; &quot;Could you help us out?&quot; &quot;And if you have to use the restroom, please ring your call button so we can send two people I don't wanna turn this We're just trying to get to Florida.&quot; I don't know. I rationalize too much, right? I think, you know what, Why do I have to change? And it's true. Everybody does love food. Bath &amp; Body Works was selling a candle that smells like mashed potatoes. How fat are you, okay, when you want your bedroom to smell like buttered mashed potatoes? This fat, turns out. I got the gravy one too. It smelled amazing. It was... It was a great deal. It was buy one, get one, and I got a free bottle 'cause I opened up a Like, it was a good deal. Number one show on TV six years in a row was Man &quot;Versus Food.&quot; - Yup. - Yeah, they're doing it again. They got a new guy 'cause the first one exploded or whatever. We don't need to do that show again. I learned everything I the first time around. I watched that show as meant to show America what if you eat unhealthy If you watch it like that, it works. You could leave here tonight. Go to YouTube, do a search Watch a clip from season one, then immediately watch You'll notice a difference right away. That guy was way skinnier when he started and he had an amazing vocabulary. Where'd that go? Watch season one. He's very articulate. He's like, &quot;Folks, there going on in my mouth right now. When I bit down, I got I got sweet from the relish, little salt from the bacon. This place, they've done it. I'll tell you, they have made perfect harmony And then six years later he's like, &quot;This is yummy.&quot; &quot;It's really good.&quot; It's too easy to eat terrible. It's everywhere, and I fall for it. I see some gimmick food. They're like, &quot;This is the most calories ever.&quot; And I'm like, &quot;I gotta try that.&quot; Wendy's has a sandwich Their food is making to sell the next day. Little sandwich children. Golden Corral? That place is still a thing? - Yes. - You ever go to Golden Corral? You can go once. Can't go twice. 'Cause when you go that first time, you learn there are no rules. There is no code of conduct. That's why it's called Golden Corral. It's just like the Old West of eating. I was like, &quot;Maybe this was a bad idea.&quot; We tried to leave, the guy's like, &quot;Sir, is there a problem?&quot; &quot;Look, man, I appreciate to a chocolate fondue fountain for $9. The problem is, I just watched a guy walk I was like, &quot;Hey, man, that's not gravy.&quot; &quot;I know.&quot; &quot;What is that you got?&quot; &quot;Whipped cream on corn on But I've needed to lose And I feel like I tried And I would talk about it on stage and then people would yell out how they think I should lose weight. One lady's like, &quot;You should go vegan.&quot; And I don't know if with enough strength to raise your hand, but... Look, if you can do I can't do it. I've only had one vegan experience. It did not go well. I was in Jacksonville and I and I passed a bakery with all these beautiful So I just kind of poked my head and I go, &quot;Excuse me, ma'am, what's that And she goes, &quot;That's and we just took it outta the Do you want one?&quot; I was like, &quot;No, I want two. But only put one in the bag 'cause the other one ain't So she hands me the one over the counter. I take a bite as we walk to the register, and I was like. Oh. She's like, &quot;Are you okay?&quot; I was like, &quot;I think you made this wrong.&quot; She goes, &quot;No, I didn't Are you not aware that I was like, &quot;I don't even And so she points to the and it says, &quot;No product contains an ingredient that comes from an animal.&quot; And I was like, &quot;Well, that's ironic. 'cause this is some bull...&quot; No. No, I didn't say it, but 'cause she deserve to hear it. And she did deserve to hear it. She should have known, when I was in the wrong place. Look at me. Look at me! I guarantee I don't look like And I would've had a if she would've been like, &quot;Sir, I think you might want Don't worry. It happens all the time. They'll have everything Milk, eggs, butter, taste. Right down the street. It's like four blocks. I'm sure you'll call an Uber. You can wait inside.&quot; I do feel like I've I tried &quot;P90X.&quot; 90-day workout plan. I made it 15 minutes. About 15 minutes. It was hard. Nobody on those DVDs look like me. Much like the vegan bakery, that should have been my clue. I'm in the wrong place, right? Everybody on there is yelling &quot;Keep going.&quot; &quot;Love that pain.&quot; &quot;Enjoy the burn.&quot; Why don't you shut up, dude? It's easy for you to say. You look like you've been Why not put one guy that so that I have a basis of comparison to how things should be I'd like to see if he's about to pass out before I'd like to know that. I might check out disc two just to see what happened to that guy. I'd be like, &quot;Well, we but we're glad that And I'm sure some of you're like, &quot;Josh, I don't know you that well, but my guess is you went No, I didn't. I went into it with a great attitude. I expedited the shipping. I upgraded to the I was dressed and ready to go the day I knew it was on I put that thing in. And within seconds, I had ever made in my entire life that led me up to that moment. And the thing is, I didn't go out looking I was just at home one night watching TV minding my own business when this guy comes on, and he's like, &quot;Hey, man, &quot;Yeah.&quot; &quot;You want it in three months?&quot; &quot;I mean, the sooner the better, I guess.&quot; &quot;Well, call me.&quot; So I called him. It was so bad. And here's the other At that time, when I started it, my health level was right here, okay? And all I wanted &quot;P90X&quot; to do was get me from here to here, right? Just a little bump. I was so bad I didn't wanna do anything. I just sat around watching every kind of Oreo that came out. You know how they do like I wanted to try all of them so I could give them an I even put a fake IP so that I could order I did. I tried Swedish Fish, Oreos. Yeah, they're terrible, but it was better than doing CrossFit. And then by the time I snapped out, I found myself here. I was like, &quot;This is messed up, dude. I'm fatter because I tried 'P90X.'&quot; And that's how I went with everything. If I didn't get immediate results, I would just sit around and get fatter, sad that it didn't work. Gym memberships, exercise I tried every kind of even if it sounded made up. I was like, &quot;Maybe it'll work for me.&quot; I tried this Minecraft Diet. Yeah. It's just three square meals a day. Listen. - Whoo! - It's a great joke. It's a great joke. Thank you. Thank you, manager of GameStop. He's the only people that like that joke. All the grandparents are like, &quot;Well, I'll tell it to my grandkid. Maybe they'll enjoy it.&quot; I don't know. I didn't like the order They start with arms. Disc one, arms. I need my arms to do stuff tomorrow. The next day, I couldn't get either arm higher than where this is. Do we all see that? That's how high both of my arms would go. To brush my teeth that morning, I had to brace against the lower my head down, and then just move it because my arms wouldn't work. My wife is... She's been very supportive of which I appreciate. She understands that, you know, I'm in a line of work and that my brain is trained in any situation. No matter how inappropriate a joke might be in that I remember the day we found out she was pregnant with our first child. She took the test and and... She's like, &quot;I'm not gonna get excited until I hear it from the doctor himself.&quot; So we go to the doctor and he comes in. He's like, &quot;Yeah, you guys are pregnant. Congratulations.&quot; And I said, &quot;What's the due date?&quot; He said, &quot;Well, if the date I'm gonna guess July 4th.&quot; And I was like, &quot;4th of He goes, &quot;Why is that?&quot; I go, &quot;I mean, the day that America is celebrating the birth of its freedom, I can mourn the death of mine.&quot; And... It's a great joke. I stand by it. And listen, at some point, I probably should have Because when someone knows they let you get away with They don't get weird. They're just like, &quot;That's what he does.&quot; I could tell by his reaction he had no idea what I did for a living. And in that moment, I had to decide, &quot;Do I tell him and make for everyone that's in it or do I challenge myself as a professional and try to replicate this over every visit for the Of course, that's what I chose. That's back when she That goes away. One day I learned a valuable lesson. Just shut up. It's good advice. If I ever meet newlyweds I always tell the dude, &quot;You don't know how good this advice is, but it is advice I wish before I had to figure it out on my own.&quot; I got terrible advice at my reception, and I blame the open bar for that, you know, looking back.&quot; I was engaged for a year and a half. They never said a word. Then there was free Now I got 27 Dr. Phils And my one buddy, I knew I told her a week out. I said, &quot;Listen, he's probably at our reception. And my only ask of you is if or even walking my way, you pull me aside or I'll be She's like, &quot;Don't worry about it.&quot; So sure enough, he's wasted, okay? We all knew he is wasted. He's break dancing by himself on the middle of the dance floor to the soundtrack from We all knew. So he goes into his back spin We lock eyes, he gets up, he starts stumbling my way. I try to find her, she's leaving the room. I was like, &quot;Oh, boy, here we go.&quot; And I've known this dude I've never seen him this drunk. I was like, &quot;Hey, man, &quot;Are you serious? This is the best wedding And let me tell you something. I was laying over there, and I was like, I've been married for a minute, you know. What kind of best friend would I be if I didn't give my boy on his wedding night?&quot; &quot;So listen, if I was just one really good...&quot; &quot;Sorry, sometimes I can feel &quot;It's just...&quot; &quot;It's just pick your battles. That's what every one of my They said, &quot;Pick your battles.&quot; They said it like it was a secret. Top level intel, I was Pulled me aside, and they're like, &quot;Dude, it's so easy. Just pick your battles.&quot; It's terrible advice. What does it mean on paper? It means if I only argue my I get to win that time. No, you don't. You never get to win. There'll be times you think you've won. She might even say, &quot;Fine, you win.&quot; You have no idea how bad I don't like the word battles. I don't think that's accurate. Very dramatic. 90% of the things you argue about when you first She came up to me one time. &quot;Come here, you got a peeper.&quot; &quot;What?&quot; &quot;You have a peeper?&quot; &quot;What's a peeper?&quot; &quot;Josh, the white stuff in your eye when you wake up in the morning.&quot; &quot;Peeper?

It's the same word, singular and plural, like, deer or fish, right?&quot; So we're going back and forth knowing neither one of us for whatever that stuff is when But my idiot friends are in &quot;Dude, you're about to decide what that's called in this house for the rest of your life.&quot; &quot;You might wanna see this So I was like, all right, battle picked. Let's dance. This is it. This is the one. I pick this one. I would like to select You could have the next 10, 15, I don't know, I was not given a number. I would like to choose this battle. She had no idea what I was talking about. It should have been over according to legend. Nope. Two hours later, I say I'm like, &quot;I'm sick of arguing about this. Let's just call somebody else.&quot; We get her friend Heather on the phone. &quot;Well, I say, crusties.&quot; &quot;Crusties? Kidding me? It's for your nose. You got a crusty or We're not even talking about this.&quot; So we call my friend Dave. &quot;I say eye boogers.&quot; I'm a grown man. I'm not gonna call them eye booger. Why didn't I just shut up? Why didn't I just... If I just shut up, I'd be sitting on the couch all by myself playing &quot;Call of Duty&quot; &quot;What's that, peeper? Oh, I must have missed that.&quot; Whatever. But you know what we call it? Peepers, you're right. We call it peepers, so I have no idea. You learn things when you get married. Your life goes into a fast It's like as soon as you next thing you hear is, &quot;What about a grandkid? When are you gonna get us a grandkid?&quot; I'm like, &quot;Take it easy, all right?

He knows that for the rest he's gonna sign every &quot;Love, Shiptop.&quot; And Mudhutt, Meemaw Mudhutt. Just 'cause this one's too This stuff keeps me up at night. My wife thinking I'm funny, like, that was a huge part because I had had so many that I felt really 'Cause when you hear growing up, women love a guy with Is that true, ladies?

Like, being funny never Like, anytime I ever tried to impress a girl, it backfired. January of 2005, I will for as long as I live. I'm walking through a mall. Very attractive woman in front when I'm walking by. She's like, &quot;Excuse me, sir. Hi, are you shopping for a And I was like, &quot;No, why?&quot; And she goes, &quot;We're having and all our bras are 50% off.&quot; So I say, &quot;I like when your bras I mean, that quick. &quot;Ma'am, I'm not gonna...&quot; I was as proud as I've Not 'cause it's that funny, but the timing was impeccable. And she didn't get it. She didn't even get it. She's like, &quot;A hundred percent? Then they'd be free.&quot; &quot;Well, that's one way of putting it. You know what, you're right. At that point, they which is back-to-back But that just got her even more confused. She's like, &quot;Okay, hang on a second. Stephanie! Steph! I'm sorry, I'm just gonna Like, I just started last week. Maybe there's a deal they where you get one.&quot; &quot;She's coming.&quot; &quot;Okay, this is my manager, Stephanie.&quot; &quot;Hi, Steph, this gentleman said that he thinks our bras should Does that...&quot; And the other girl was like. &quot;Did he say that?&quot; &quot;Sir, this is my new employee. Don't mess with her.&quot; &quot;Then we wouldn't make any money.&quot; And I was like, &quot;Well, I But listen, I digress.&quot; There's a moral to that story. It's very subtle. I don't know if you picked it up. But sometimes you gotta If I was really trying to maybe I would've played But I said what I wanted to I had an awesome story And that's what I'd say to everybody. Do what makes a better There'll be times in life where I'm like, &quot;I shouldn't do this, but I know 250 people in Sarasota that might want to hear about it if I do,&quot; and I do it for you, okay? Yeah. Many years ago, I farted Now, to some of you, apparently, that's a complete story. There's a lot more to it, okay? I don't just go around She earned it. Here's what happened. I was living in Los Angeles and I was flying home to It was a red-eye flight, left LA at 1:00 AM, stopped in Texas, then that same plane Now, the airport is I'm not really paying And I give the lady to my ticket and I start to walk down onto the plane. The jet bridge is backed up and I noticed a girl standing is Jessica Simpson. Now, at that time, she who's also from Cincinnati. At the time, he was at sporting events and nightclubs. His whole family still lived there. It's Thanksgiving, I thought, that's probably So just making conversation. I go, &quot;You going to Cincinnati?&quot; And she was like, &quot;Are you talking to me?&quot; &quot;No, why would I go to Cincinnati?&quot; And in my head I was like, &quot;Well, aside from the list of reasons that I just came up with, is that a crazy question to ask anyone getting on a plane that's But I kept my cool. I was like, &quot;Oh, I'm sorry, I just thought maybe you're or his family for the holidays.&quot; I said, &quot;I'm a standup comedian and I've actually met him a few times. He's always been a really cool guy.&quot; And she goes, &quot;I'm sure And I was like, &quot;No, you didn't.&quot; I was upset, okay? 'Cause I, nor anyone, ever I don't care who you are or how many times I've and then photoshopped myself into 'em. That's not the point right now. And I would've been able to get over it if I was sitting anywhere But she's in the last row first class and I'm one row back in So every time I glance up, I see her in her big comfy chair getting whatever she wants brought to her the second she asked for it, and every time I looked And I thought about my The whole time I lived in Hollywood, the only thing they ever asked me was, &quot;Have you met anybody famous yet?&quot; Now I finally had, what was I gonna say? &quot;Yeah, she's not very nice.&quot; That's a boring story. So... We land in Texas. I'm wide awake in the middle of the night and I decided, &quot;You know what, I'm gonna just get off the plane, I'm gonna get some food, and then I'm gonna get back So I step out into the aisle, she's just waking up. And by the time she she ends up directly behind me while we're waiting for when I felt it. And it wasn't like my stomach hurts, it was, &quot;This is God for the way that I was Right? And even then, I was If it makes a sound, everybody's Plus, the power of the so the air wasn't circulating anymore. So there were gonna be a you know what I'm saying? Some serious collateral damage. But it's all I could think to do. I knew at that moment it or no story. So, I throw it out there, and it's awful, okay? It was unacceptable. There were people turning around like they might be able They were just like. And I wanted to turn around to but I knew I couldn't So I'm like, &quot;The door's I was like, &quot;Keep it together. We're gonna be outta The war is over. Clearly, I'm the victor.&quot; Right? So we finally get out into the terminal and I get this feeling. It's a feeling that comedians have when they think something's funny. It doesn't count until someone &quot;Yeah, that's good.&quot; So I call my best friend back He's like, &quot;Hello.&quot;^ I was like, &quot;Look, man, I'm I still need to be picked I had to let somebody know I farted on Jessica Simpson. And from a sound sleep, And I was like, &quot;Thank you for saying that.&quot; 'Cause if he liked it at 4:30, he was gonna love it at noon. So, thank you guys for coming out tonight. I appreciate you being here. Have a good night. Thank you very much.
