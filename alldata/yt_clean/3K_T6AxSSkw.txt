We're heading to Chokh. It's famous for its history and architecture. But also, it was a trading center on the Silk Road. I'm not even sure how I ended up cooking here. Wow! Brush some butter on it. It feels so warm and cozy. It's like staying at a relative's house. Good morning. This is Viskhan. Viskhan. Just Khan. This is Khan. Like Genghis Khan. We're with Genghis Khan. He was not initially part of my plan. I have to be in this area for about 4-5 days before boarding a ship from Georgia to Bulgaria. By pure accident, I got his contact info yesterday. So I contacted him. So, he came and picked me up. Tell them this is the birthplace of Khabib Nurmagomedov, OK. He beat Conor McGregor. which he said is the most beautiful. - That's right. That's it! No! And this is actually the most beautiful road which connects ... So, it's the most beautiful road between Makhachkala and ... Between Makhachkala and Buynaksk. It's a beautiful city. If you've heard of the names in this region like Chechnya and Dagestan, you might have heard of them in the news. This includes better news on their famous UFC fighters, and news on a more horrible side, like terrorism and extremism. The footage captures the skirmish between gunmen and security forces in Dagestan's capital of Makhachkala. Authorities say at least 15 police officers after gunmen launched simultaneous attacks. Whether it's the Moscow theater siege, school sieges, or the concert shooting early this year. Authorities now say at least 137 people died after 4 gunmen fired at the concertgoers. Children, parents, and teachers were herded into the gym. They wanted Russian troops to leave the nearby republic of Chechnya. All of these incidents originated from this area. There's a history behind it. It's not like they just became this way for no reason. I'll tell you about it later. I won't talk about it in the car. I'll go somewhere quiet and tell you more about it. But we won't just focus on these issues. We'll also enjoy ... Learning about local people. What you see on the news is one thing. But local history and relationships with local people are another. This time we'll focus on the latter. I've already told him I want to stay in local homes and eat local food because there are so many pubs here in the North Caucasus region. That's it. Let's go and have fun! Good job. Tres bien. How do you say that in your language? &quot;Geng mak.&quot; &quot;Geng mak.&quot; &quot;Geng mak&quot;? &quot;Geng mak.&quot; - &quot;Geng mak.&quot; &quot;Geng mak!&quot; Cow crossing. Like in India. Want some steak? No! We're now heading to Chokh. And ... You have something in your throat, and you're trying to ... We will see local cuisine. We will see really old, 2,000-year-old houses. - How Dagestani people lived before, yeah? We will see really authentic local people. They're really huge, really strong. And they're really good fighters. Or the ones that fought all the invaders. He just told me a lot about how the mountains are important to people in this North Caucasus region. The mountains served as their refuge when invaders came. When they couldn't fight in the lowlands, they would retreat and fight guerrilla warfare in the mountains. This has been their way from ancient times until today. 50 minutes, maybe. This guy's thirsty. Yeah. Now in Russia, because of the war, Oh, true. How do you get Coca-Cola? What we call parallel import. For example, we buy it from Pakistan, Thailand, Iran. From other countries that are not the U.S., right? Parallel import. Does it affect you guys in any way, with the sanction and the war? A little bit. The main thing is that the cars have increased a lot in price, especially Toyota. We'll be crossing over this mountain through a tunnel. We've on the mountain now. The temperature dropped instantly. Let's take a coffee break now. It's coffee mixed with nuts. What do you call that coffee? Raf with Urbech. - Huh? - Raf? OK. With Urbech. Urbech is pressed melted nuts. That's the nut sauce. It's really a nut sauce. That's the nut sauce. Is it hot, thought? It must be. Whoa! Whoa! It's so good! It's so good! Let's take some selfies. Wow, it's ... So aromatic. This is just a small coffee shop in the mountain. They take their coffee culture very seriously here. Everyone is really into coffee. OK, selfie. Show your coffee. Mmm. Tres bien. How many languages do you speak? OK. Arabic. Russian. Ingush, Arabic, Russian, French, English, And ... not German. Deutsch. And Thai? I will start to learn the language. Alright, I'll take a quick break. If you come here, you need to drink the nut coffee He's a really famous person. - Is he? He's famous? When the Russian government wants to hold an exhibition, they invite him to show all this art. Is it Dagestani craft? Traditional Dagestani art. Is this a glass or a vase? Some kind of vase. So pretty. This is the final product. That's Putin! He's famous! We've arrived at Chokh! I'm in this state because the Russian roads are really rough. The views along the way are breathtaking. But I couldn't film anything. What's the importance of Chokh? It's famous for its history and architecture. But also, it was a trading center on the Silk Road. The northern branch of the Silk Road cuts through the Caucasus, from Derbent in the east to the Darial Gorge in the center and to the Black Sea in the west. And also, this village has a lot of different craftsmen. People with craftsmanship. For example, people who work with iron or with stone, as you can see. There were and still are really good workers. Are those buildings original? Yes, almost everything you see is original. We're walking inside. It's an old village. The cars are parked outside. And we have to walk in from here. This is the hotel I wanted to stay at. It's so beautiful. I just came out of the bathroom. If you'll notice, there's no one at the hotel. The owner isn't here. And the doors are left open. This really shows that the crime rate must be low here. As you can see ... we just walked right in and used their bathroom. Just like that. Oh, there's a cat. I'll call them and check if there's a room for me. Hello. That's the owner of the place and his wife. What you see there is a container for collecting stream water, a knife, and a Papakha. It's a traditional ancient costume from this region. Turns out this place is fully booked. So, we'll go stay somewhere else, but still in this town. Right now, we're sipping tea. I was just telling him that before I came to this region, I thought it would be quite backward. I didn't expect it to be so developed because ... From what I read, this area seems to have been heavily impacted by the Chechen War. I thought this area would be abandoned by Russia. But when I arrived, it was a completely different story. Everything looks so developed. It's bewildering. Even coming into the mountains, I thought there wouldn't be any reception. I told my staff I'd be going off the grid. But there's full 4G here. And ... The only bad thing was the roads. But everything else is stellar. Accommodation, supermarkets. It's way beyond what I imagined. Like yesterday evening, when we went out for a walk, there were so many restaurants and coffee shops. We have a good expression. It means if you're not following time, you will fall under the wheel of time. It means you need to preserve your history. But at the same time, you need to move forward with civilization, with engineering, technology, and other things. I'm gonna cook some food with them. I'm not even sure how I ended up cooking here. I'm so confused. She will be such a good wife. You have to wait until you see how I cook first. Then probably, I'll get kicked out. If I'm not poisoned after my meal, that's OK. Thank you. What are we cooking? I'm not sure what we're cooking. What do we have to cook? You're cooking a local flatbread with a filling. It's called Chudu. Ah, I ate it yesterday. But locally, it's called Botichon. - Botichon. Is it like cottage cheese? Yeah. Ah, OK. This is cottage cheese? [Speaking Russian] Local people make it in their houses. So, it's homemade cottage cheese. And then, we just ... We're gonna keep kneading. Until it's broken up. Me? OK. Not like that. Oh, this is soda! We're gonna add a bit, so it doesn't get bitter. Nice! Yes. &quot;Da&quot; is &quot;OK,&quot; which in Thai we say &quot;Dai.&quot; [Speaking in Thai] Yes. That's prepared in advance. It's like in Masterchef. Tell her. This is like, we prepare it. And then, this is already done. She's kneading this one in a different way. Oh! She's pressing it to make it compact. It's now a solid lump. - Muka. It's so soft. Look! So soft. That's cheese, and this is our dough. Pick out a small piece. Oh, like this. It's good now. [Speaking in Thai] Yes. [Speaking in Thai] Yes. [Speaking in Thai] Yes. She told me to wash my hands. Let the dough rest here. Put them next to each other. These are for making Chudu or Bokuras. I think I got the name wrong. Just let them rest. Apricot juice. Apricot! Apricot juice. Voda. Oh, &quot;voda&quot; is &quot;water.&quot; She added water. She added flour to the apricot juice. And she's stirring it. We have to heat it on the stove. And then ... I know! I took a whiff, and all I smelled was the gas. Keep stirring. This is our dough. Muka. Ah, OK. This. And then this. And then this? Yes. Brush some butter on it. You can eat this with your hands, without any forks. OK. Just roll it. Just roll? Isn't it hot? No, it's OK. Look at how melty it is! It's all cheese! So good! Really good! It has such a nice cottage cheese aroma, and it's so mellow. All the aromas just come together so well. I'm blown away. It's so rich. So rich. It's super cheesy. Delicious. [Apricot porridge] So beautiful. The apricot is sweet and smells really nice. Delicious. So good. Meow. Hello. Meow. He talked back! We're leaving the village and looking for accommodation. I just talked to ... a Dagestani person who emigrated to Germany and came back here. He said this is his favorite place among all the cities he's visited. But now, it's becoming more popular. More tourists are coming. And he's worried about one thing. I think this goes for many tourist destinations. That one thing is the kind of change that destroys the area's unique character and identity. He's starting to see some houses being built in modern styles. And people in the area can't keep up. They can't implement regulations in time about what needs to be preserved. This is unlike Italy, where they have very strict rules about how cities should look. That's why their preservation efforts work. But here, they don't have that yet. There's a risk that this thousands-year-old city could change irreversibly. We'll just have to wait and see. This is where I'll be spending the night. That's the mother of the family. I still don't see where I'll be sleeping. Wow, nice house! Oh, cool! Nice! Oh, so cozy! It's so cute. It's very warm and cozy. It's like staying at a relative's house. It doesn't feel like a hotel. It's more like a relative's house. So lovely. This is kompot. It's so good. She said it's made from what's called Marina. I don't have no idea what it is. But I'm just gonna enjoy it. You grow these? Yes. In the garden. In the garden outside! My Russian is not bad! It's like I came here to be fed. Privyet! Privyet! So good. Is it good? Um ... delicious. I can say in Russian ... Spasiba. Privyet. Da. Nyet. Kholodno. Kholodno. Zharko. Zharko? Zharko. Zharko. Kholodno. That's it.. [Speaking Russian] Apricot. Abrikos. Da. Oh, the sun is about to set. Look at that. Trees and flowers everywhere. So lovely. Apricots. Such a lush garden. Bye bye. She's so lovely.
