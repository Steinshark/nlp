So, a few months ago, I received a message and when I opened it I was in shock. I just got invited for the official Ballon d'Or ceremony in Paris. I really couldn't believe it, but as soon as I realized I was One, enjoy the moment. And two, set myself a challenge. I challenged myself to shake hands with all the players I meet at the Ballon d'Or. Normally, I only see all these players on television. But for one time, I will have the chance to meet them in real life. If this challenge works, my hand will be worth millions. So, from now on, we're getting ready. It's time to go inside. Let's make this moment happen. Three, two, one. First, we had the red carpet, but as soon as we stepped the first player I saw was World Cup winner Emiliano Martinez. So, it was time for my first handshake. -Nice to meet you. Can I have a picture? -Thank you very much! At this moment, I was so happy, but there was no time to rest. Ballon d'Or nominee Kvaratskhelia entered the building. Thank you very much. [Commentator] &lt;i&gt;Is there anything this man can't do?&lt;/i&gt; So, that is two. At this point, I really felt like this could work. And there he is. Our Belgian legend Aiden Hazard. [Commentator] &lt;i&gt;It's Hazard.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;It's a magnificent equalizer!&lt;/i&gt; I'm algo Belgian! Oh, I know you. You're from Belgium. -Can I take a picture? I think we can call this a hat trick. Three famous football players within 10 minutes. Merci, Eden. -He knows you. And we know him. And this player doesn't need an introduction. It's the man himself, Erling Haaland. As if that wasn't enough, a full Manchester City squad arrived. I had to go for it. -Can I take a picture, please? Nice to meet you. Thank you very much. Nice to meet you. Thank you very much. What?! Crazy!!! -That's crazy. Okay, this was crazy, but there is still more to come. Nice to meet you. [Commentator] &lt;i&gt;Can he score it? Yes!&lt;/i&gt; Nice to meet you. [Commentator] &lt;i&gt;Got to be Rodri!&lt;/i&gt; For me, the favourite of the women's Ballon d'Or was Bonmati. [Commentator ] &lt;i&gt;And she still has it.&lt;/i&gt; [Commentator ] &lt;i&gt;Aitana, brilliant. Perfection!&lt;/i&gt; And suddenly, I realised she was standing in front of me. Thank you! Again, there was no time to rest. The players were coming in full speed. Next up... And what if I say Madrid? What player comes first to your mind? For me, it's Vini Jr. Vinicius! You're just walking behind Vini. There is Vini, there is Celine. OK, OK. If I say Madrid, there are a few more names that can come to your mind. Maybe it's the name of Jude. A picture was not possible... BUT WATCH UNTIL THE END but I managed to give him a handshake. And out of the blue, Ter Stegen came down the stairs. Thank you! For all the people who I only had one thing to say to Drogba. I'd say, 68. There is a problem. There is a problem. How are you? You good? -68, remember? -Did you post your numbers? What did it say? They say it's crazy! That was a really fun moment, but when Beckham enters the room, all eyes are on him. I managed to shake hands with the legend, and he even smiled at me. As this night couldn't get any more crazy, I saw seven-time Ballon d'Or winner Lionel Messi walking up the stairs. I really tried to get as close as possible, but there were too many people and his bodyguard looks so scary. That's crazy. So, last but not least, I saw Kylian Mbappe making his way up. With all the people focusing on Messi and Beckham, I just went for it, and this happened. RANDOM BELL RIGNING Whoa, whoa, whoa. Thank you all so much for making things like this possible. Anyways, after this moment, it was time to enter the show. Here we couldn't record a lot, but as you may already know, Bonmati won the Ballon d'Or women, and Messi won the Ballon d'Or men. Oh yeah, can we talk about this? I shook Drogba's hand, and Drogba shook Messi's hand, so that means... The 2023 Ballon d'Or France Football Footballer is Lionel Messi. When the show was over, I managed to take a picture with the goat and the Ballon d'Or. And when I turned around, Bellingham was passing by. So, to end this unforgettable experience, I asked him to take my final picture. So, we really shook hands with 18 famous football players. I'll never wash my hands again. THAT'S NASTY... Thank you all so much for your support. I'll see you in the next video. SUBSCRIBE!!!
