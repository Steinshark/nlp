I love a good pineapple when it's hot. Orange. When it's hot. I'm so glad that regular but that's not what I'm talking about. Regular fruits are old news. You gotta get on the exotic fruit train. And taste its disembodied flesh its unique outward appearance? Exactly. It's time for. Don't Rind if I Fruit Mystery Okay, go ahead and taste the insides and then you're going to guess your options on the board. If you guess correctly, You'll then have the chance to from for an additional point. And the person at the end with the the world's most exotic snack, and perhaps more importantly, five thousand seven hundred and And we get to take home an exotic snack. We get to take that home, you know what I'm saying? And they don't have to stay here. I'm glad you're excited about that, too. How would you describe the texture of this? Because I will go ahead and tell you. There is no taste. There's a. It's like a tasteless apple. There's a taste that accumulates It began to register a little bit. What? It almost tastes like a. Well, but it almost feels like a tater, a potato. But like, between a potato and an apple. There's something a little stinky. It it stinky? Are you getting a little stinky? Are you getting a little horny? Are you getting. One thing at a time. There's a pineapple here after me. I'm so excited about pineapple. There it is. It might not be a pineapple, though. Could this be that? Could it be this? Can we touch it? No. You can gesture closely towards though. It is a little stinky. I've seen number one before. These are cool. Look at that. Isn't that cool? Number six. All right. I do not know what this is. Hold on. What has a lot of white innards that can be diced? All right, let's poke at the same time. Three, two, one. I thought maybe that, but I'm actually. Yeah. These are small. I could not decide between those two. Number three is small, you can get that. You just had cherimoya, which is fruit number four. So, you can go ahead and take inspect it. You can cut it open, because the question you where is it from? Cherimoya? I like this. It looks. It looks like. It kind of looks like a heart. It also kind of has a little bit of a. Nipple, like a suckle the teat Am I wrong? You're not wrong, dude. It has an artichoke. It's hard. It's hard. Look to. And all the seeds popped out when he did that, I'm trying to plant some. One note about the seeds, gentlemen. They are very, very poisonous. So if they have been crushed Okay, good. You will get sick. So just try to go around and eat just the flesh. What kind of sick? I don't know, but I have a feeling you'll have food coming out of one end and the other. I thought you were calling Rhett specs. I don't know, specs. You know, something that I don't. Link would be specs. Do I have on little glasses today? Okay, so. Oh, my gosh. It actually. It could cause, like, stumbling seizures and paralysis. Oh, well. It's not your typical diarrhea. Let's try it, because that's funny. Physical humor. But when you got to seizures, probably not.

I got my teeth whitened yesterday. Okay. And the reason I got them It's for my dentist. Because my dentist. I know this is weird, circular reasoning. When my dentist sees my teeth, So I got him to whiten them. Because I know my teeth don't show. I mean, my teeth don't even show in my little thing. And they were getting. You could lose all of them. They were getting a little stained, For your dentist? And what I didn't realize at the session is the hygienist was like, eat nothing but white foods And I was like, do you know what I do for a living? This isn't white, man. So I'm making some exceptions to that. I'm not just sticking with white foods, strongly colored fruits is something to avoid. And I didn't want to say anything. What are you gonna do then? Just look at it. I'm gonna get. I think if I get a part that maybe I'll be all right. Do your teeth not hurt really bad? They hurt real bad. I was gonna say. I ain't never gonna get it done.

I should have chosen this, And we both should have chosen it because. It's the same color. We're both so dumb, but in different directions. Oh, yeah. Obviously. Look at that. Nice. Look at that.
