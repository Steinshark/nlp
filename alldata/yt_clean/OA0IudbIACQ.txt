Hello, we are AU! And today we're going to be reacting to the My Girlfriend is Pregnant episode. Let's start. Oh my god. -This is the first shoot where I'm pregnant for the first time. [Shall we begin?] Oh my god. You look- Your hair, Alan! You're ginger. Alan, you look so different. Kolya! I like it. I like your hair. Super different. Great, super different vibe. Yeah. Wow. That's it. -Wow, you look so different! I love this line. [That was it?] No kisses. That's Roma! Producer Roma! These shots are so cool. Oh my gosh. Chelsea. Close your eyes! Everyone, close your eyes! No! Oh my god. Oh my god! Everyone had a shock. Oh my gosh. Oh yeah. Yes. Oh yeah. I remember this moment. Surprise! It's been a year and I have the same mole. Kolya is such a gentleman. Randomly mad. No. Wow, your hair. Yeah. Whoa. Oh gosh. Too much kissing. Go Ellie! It's our friend Ellie. Wow. My favorite moment! What kiss is that? Party! I love those captions Eye contact. Eye contact. And what are you doing, guys? Nothing. Don't tell anyone. Having fun? Yeah, everything's great. Random kiss! Like, I love random kissing in Alan's universe. Like, kiss on the cheek. This is the biggest rejection ever. I think my parents are here after you get kissed. Oh my gosh. Alan, you should really think of a better excuse next time. I wonder what they were doing. What's happening now? I don't remember this moment, actually. I have an idea. Oh, the symbolism. What does the white bow represent? Does anyone know? Guys, write in the comments! Because I, really, when I was watching it, I did not know what, like, why, what is the bow? It represents something. You will see. Should we just tell them? I love the music there, though. It was the first real kiss, like, in here. Like, super real. And you seem really good like you comfortable. How long have you known each other? Oh my gosh! Actually, my college friend just sent me a picture from eight years ago. Oh my god when I started college. So, like, probably eight years. -Wow. It's been a good journey. Yeah, it has. -Wow. Wakey-wakey. [Hello, how is it going today?] Kolya. [...I have a date with you today.] Michelle! Another Michelle! [She's just a classmate.] [I don't even like her.] Bad boy. Kolya is so different. Fail! Fail! Oh, no! [Are you ignoring me?] Why do you guys always laugh? It's not true. -I love- [Last night was a mistake!] Again with the white bow. Bad boy. Kolunya was a bad boy right from the start. Chelsea you'll be fine. At least right now you're here with a baby. Yeah, I need my girlfriends. No worries. We're all supporting Chelsea. I'll take care of you and my baby. I love the question marks, the go! Sometimes talks, sometimes can't talk. I love it to be pregnant. I love the toilet rolls. [What happened?] [Do you have food poisoning?] It's like suddenly we all just stopped talking. It gets funnier, guys. It gets funnier. [Wait, are you sure you're okay?] [Because I just feel like you're-] I'm waiting for a random kiss. Another random kiss, please. Right now! Don't wait. Right now! Yeah! Random kiss! It happened! I love that slo-mo. Yes, that shot's always a good one. The question is how Chelsea switched the boyfriend. Yeah, that's true. Oh, old room! It's like really old. Wow. Oh, wow. It looks so different. That's a cozy room. It looks so smaller. Smaller, yeah, exactly. So now we changed this room after the Bella Poarch episode to a new room that we use all the time now. Thanks, Bella Poarch! Thank you, Bella! Keep going! That was a cool shot. Use this. But who put that there? And how? Who did this? Yeah, it can't be. Chelsea, who did you give the keys from your room? It can't be. I like... Oh my gosh. So many questions. Wait, you guys, I have a question. If you guys were to get pregnant right now, what would you do? Like right now? Right now? I would film an Alan's Universe episode. Of course. I would not be that happy, but I don't know. Like, I would be, I think I would panic a lot and I would just like, I'm not ready for it. I'm like, how can I raise a baby if I'm still like a baby, I don't know. But we could use my child in the AU episodes. Oh my God. Oh, back to the story. What is she going to do? What is she going to do? Chelsea, what? -Pregnant. Maybe somebody doesn't know that like- I mean when you're in the position... How how would you know what to do? Yeah, what's the white bow? Honestly. I love- Oh, I love it. I love the shot. Oh my gosh. -Great job team. Transition. -Don't blink, don't blink. Eleven. That's literally perfect. It's so clear. She got eight hours of sleep. 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. And she woke up beautiful. -No makeup. Wow, guys, if you wake up like this in the morning, like this video. Oh, my God. The transition. I love it. I love this part. Yeah. He is not a happy dad, I guess. He's not ready for the kid in two years. Oh, even our school uniform is different. Everything is different. And the school. Yeah. And the classmates. Old school vibes. Old school vibes. [Wait.] What's that? What's that? Oh, wait, pause! We have a special treat. We have this prop, which is the real burn book that we made from that episode. Our amazing art director, Roma, made this, so let's see who's in it. Let's see! Oh, Lena! It says, Foo! Stupid girl! Aww. Who did that? Roma! Roma! Remember Ivan from A4 episode? No, I don't remember! Who is that? Someone's boyfriend's here. Ivan is the funny one. Oh, Nevada! Who wrote this? Stupid emo loser? No, that's mean. Next is Liana! Liana was in our second episode Bully by Rich Zolotova. Wow, super frog! She's got abs. That bully should really think how to bully people in a more interesting way. Yeah, because this is a really good photo of Liana. Okay, next is... Michelle Cannelli! She's in the video! She's in the video, and... Maybe she helped to make the book? I don't know. We'll find out. We'll see. And then next is, oh, it's me, but I like this photo. Oh, what does it say? Oh, it says loser alert, ugly nerd. Again, not that great bully. And these two photos, I actually feel grateful. Oh, teen dad. You, hate, hate, hate. But it's a really flattering photo. I know, you guys should take ugly photos like in the mafia episode of me. But just to show you that our props are real. They're not AI. This is real. Even the belly! Even the belly is real. We had to eat a lot of crumble cookies to get it. I'm craving. Oh, super girl. There you go. In real time. Oh no, the tea. Oh, teen dad. Oh, Roma! We stick together. We are? Wait, what happened to these pages? Oh, no. I love this. Help me to go. Just your classmate is like teasing you. I'm just like a fly to you. A fun fact, this hospital is actually now the room that I sleep in. We just... Oh, wait. Oh, yeah. It's the girls' room. Oh, yeah. It's the same girls' room. The transition. I love that transition. Wow. So, Michelle is the one who put the pregnancy test. Yeah, how did she come out from my closet? There's too many questions guys. Just... Just relax. -Iconic line! Actually, we quote this line all the time in AU. It's kind of a local joke. Yeah. Don't tell anyone! How did you feel filming that scene? I remember it's what the second episode I know it was like a new emotion, something new for me, new people, new character, it was fun, it was cool. And I feel, you know, how they level up, like, now, the last time, it's a great feeling. Yeah, true. But don't tell anyone. [Do something!] Team pressure! [And the whole class started to pay attention.] [We wanted to tell everyone that Kolya's the father, so he would take care of you and the baby.] Oh yeah, Kolya. Hero's Kolya. They bullied on purpose, but for the good reason. I don't know. [I will take care of you and our child.] [Please forgive me.] I'm so happy. Guys, we're good. You're all so sweet. Whoa! I love that shot. The white bow is back. Happy house. I love this, like, random couples, like, at the end. I know, Alan and Michelle got together, finally! Yay! Yeah, we're together in this one. Look at all the Legos. But what about Chelsea kissing Alan in a chick and loves him for the whole episode? Um... Wow! Wow, that was good. Legendary episode. My favorite part? I have so many favorite parts of this episode but my favorite part is when Michelle stops me when I'm talking and she goes, you wanted to take care of... I don't know why it makes me laugh so much because it's like kind of random. How about you? What's your favorite part? My favorite part? I guess when Chelsea starts to see me and I do like... Yeah, I literally was about to say it. Like, I love the random shots in this whole episode. I feel like they do feel random because it was so long ago. And we're not doing too much talking. And I feel like it was more childish in a good way. But it was more for children. I like that actually it was shot super well. Like super beautiful. Like the shot, the POVs and the bow shot. It's like really interesting shots, really. So we can clearly see how we grew up. Yeah. The production, the acting... Everything is so high level. Yeah. My favorite funny part is when everyone just oh, I just stop talking. After throwing up in the bathroom and then and then Alan keeps saying wait, but did you wait but how did you? That's definitely my favorite part. Favorite part for camera was the fire transition. Yeah, that's true. So good. All right, guys, thanks so much for joining us and see you next time. Bye!
