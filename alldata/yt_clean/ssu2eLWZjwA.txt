is a blade that's designed for both framing and demolition any better than a framing blade after all a framing blade is a lot less expensive compared to these demolition and framing blades we got a bunch of different brands of tests today so let's get the testing underway and see which brand is the best and the first test we'll see which blade cuts the fastest through clean two by fours and then we'll see how the blades hold up after they cut through 30 nails embedded in two by fours and then we'll see how the blades perform cutting through some shingles finally we'll see if any of the blades can survive cutting through some deck screws at a price of only eight dollars the least expensive blade we'll be testing is this milwaukee brand this milwaukee bread is going to serve as our control it's just a regular framing blade and not designed for demolition it advertises precision ground tungsten carbide teeth for fast smooth cuts thin kerf designed for clean fast cuts all the blades we'll be testing are seven and a quarter inch heat expansion slots reduce blade stress for accurate cuts made in china 182 grams i put together a really simple test rig to test the blades the saw is on a set of rollers that fits into a track the saw slides in a perfectly straight line to prevent the blade from binding the bottomless saw won't rest on the wood that we're cutting during the test to avoid that becoming a factor that messes with the test results i'll be using a five pound weight and a pulley system to pull the saw through the cut the saw is aligned precisely with the pulley to test new blade performance i'll cut 12 inch pieces of 2x4 lumber each blade will make three passes beginning with milwaukee and the milwaukee made quick work of it on the first pass at 2.63 seconds and the milwaukee was slightly faster in the second pass at 2.47 very consistent results with the milwaukee at 2.57 seconds on a third pass at a price of only 10 the least expensive framing and demolition blade that we'll be testing is made by hercules and sold at harbor freight non-stick electric shield coating precision laser-cut vents for extreme stability urkley's brand is professionally made in china for hercules tools at 199 grams the hercules weighs 17 grams more than the milwaukee hercules was slightly faster than milwaukee at 2.22 seconds once again 2.22 seconds for the hercules so very consistent results at 2.37 seconds on the third pass at a price of 12 is this evolution premium series framing and demolition blade just like the milwaukee and the hercules it has 24 teeth even though the evolution claims to be for demolition it says not for use on ferrous metals the evolution is made in japan the evolution is the heaviest blade yet at 213 grams evolution is the fastest yet at 2.17 seconds on the first pass once again 2.17 seconds for the evolution very consistent results at 2.22 seconds on the third pass for the evolution at a price of 13 is this master force framing and demolition blade which is sold at menards ideal for tough cutting applications and wood with nails it claims to offer eight times longer life laser-cut heat expansion slots allows blade to expand under heat and stress to prevent warping laser cut mock stabilizer vents absorbs noise vibration and prevents blade wobble for smooth cuts premium ptfe coating reduces friction and heat buildup for less drag gumming and corrosion at 183 grams the master force weighs just one gram more than the milwaukee master force was the fastest yet at 1.88 seconds master force was slightly faster in a second pass in 1.66 seconds it was slightly slower on a third pass at 2.22 seconds at a price of 14 is this dewalt brand framing and demolition blade ideal for wood with nails patented body slot technology for smooth cuts laser cut plate and carbide face grind premium carbide for long life the dewalt brand is made in china at 185 grams the dewalt only weighs 3 grams more than milwaukee framing blade dewalt performed the same as the milwaukee at 2.63 seconds on the first pass dewalt did slightly better on the second pass at 2.52 seconds 2.63 seconds on the third pass so very consistent results just like the dewalt brand this diablo brand also costs 14 demo demon ultimate framing and demolition with new tracking point amped tooth geometry diablo brand is made in italy at 188 grams the diablo weighs just three grams more than the dewalt diablo is nearly the same as the dewalt at 2.68 seconds on the first pass the diablo is slightly faster than the second pass at 2.22 seconds 2.52 seconds on the third pass so very consistent results for the diablo at a price of 15 is a spider tarantula brand polymer stabilizing vents ultra tough nickel cobalt up to 10 times longer lasting than regular blades it's designed for wood with nails interfuse anti-friction coating carbide and steel made in germany assembled in china the spider tarantula weighs 194 grams the spider moved into second place at 1.87 seconds on the first pass it was nearly as fast at 1.87 seconds on a second pass very consistent results at 2.02 seconds on the third pass at a price of 20 is this bosch edge extreme carbide the bosch edge does not claim to be designed for framing fast cut for nail demolition 14 teeth speed coat anti-friction finish brute carbide for long life the bosch is made in china the bosch edge is by far the heaviest yet at 344 grams the bosch has a much thicker kerf and only 14 teeth which really slowed the blade down 7.62 seconds on the first pass the bars did slightly better at 7.04 seconds on a second pass the third pass was the fastest of the three at 6.89 seconds if you're looking for a really extreme looking blade check out this big blue heavy duty demolition blade at a price of 28 large gullets and never clog reduces friction to keep blade revolutions high 3 16 inch kerf 5 teeth extra thick steel body will not warp or crack five times longer life outlasts other framing demolition blades when cutting harsh materials the big blue is quite a bit heavier than average at 260 grams the big blue brand has by far the thickest kerf and only five teeth which really slowed the blade down 10.14 seconds on the first pass and big blue did slightly better at 8.46 seconds on the second pass and big blue logged its slowest time yet on a third pass at 14.6 seconds and the most expensive blade that we'll be testing at 32 dollars is made by a mana tool industrial carbide tip nail cutting 14 tooth blade made in european union large european style micro green carbide tips stay sharper longer standard kerf size for smooth vibration free cutting it claims to be designed for wood with nails but right below that not recommended for ferrous non-ferrous or masonry the amana tools blade is the heaviest yet at 355 grams amanda tools is the heaviest of all the blades and has a pretty thick kerf considering the blade design it performed fairly well at 5.16 seconds the amount of blade was slightly faster in a second pass at 4.7 seconds it was nearly as fast on the third pass at 4.96 seconds so very consistent results taking the average of three tests the master force is the fastest blade at 1.92 seconds but spider is a close second and 1.95 evolution third at 2.19 hercules 2.27 diablo 2.47 in milwaukee 2.56 so the three blades designed specifically for demolition finished in the last three positions i'm going to add 10 16 penny nails to each one of these two by fours and then we'll cut through it with each of the blades to see how they perform the milwaukee cut through the board with the 10 nails in 4.86 seconds on the first pass the milwaukee made quick and easy work of the nails the milwaukee slowed down a little to 5.31 seconds on the second pass and milwaukee really slowed down quite a bit to 9.17 seconds on the third pass in fairness to milwaukee it's definitely not designed for cutting through nail embedded wood with the milwaukee 19 out of 24 teeth have damage the hercules did great on the first pass at only 3.39 seconds the hercules slowed down by nearly a second on the second pass at 4.3 seconds it lost another half second on the third pass at 4.81 22 out of 24 teeth on the hercules have damage evolution blasted through the nails in only 3.03 seconds on the first pass it slowed down slightly on the second pass of 3.69 seconds it lost over a second on the third pass at 5.16 seconds with the evolution 16 out of 24 teeth have some damage while the master force was the fastest cutting through the clean wood it really struggled with the nails 9.78 seconds on the first pass the master force did better in a second pass at 6.28 seconds but the blade seems to be heating up and it slowed down quite a bit midway through the pass once again the master force seems to be overheating midway through the pass and it needed 7.65 seconds to make the cut 21 out of 23 teeth on the master force to experience some damage most of the damage though was pretty minor the dewalt is quite a bit slower than the hercules in the evolution at 4.3 seconds on the first pass the dewalt lost over a second on a second pass at 5.67 seconds the dewalt slowed down again by over a second on the third pass 6.89 seconds 20 out of 24 teeth on the dewalt experienced some very minor chipping the diablo made the second fastest pass at 3.28 seconds the diabolo lost just over half a second on the second pass at 3.89 seconds the diablo lost just over half a second again on the third pass at 4.96 seconds the diablo seemed to hold up really well with 17 out of 24 teeth experiencing very minor damage the spider made pretty good time in the first pass at 3.44 seconds the spider slowed down by half a second on the second pass at 3.95 seconds the spider lost about a second and a half on the third pass 5.62 seconds 16 out of 24 teeth on the spider brand have minor damage the bosch has a much thicker blade and needed 7.18 seconds to cut through the clean wood the nail slowed it down a little to 9.22 seconds the bosch lost over two seconds on the second pass and needed 11.81 seconds to finish the job it really lost a lot of speed on the third pass and needed 15 seconds the bosch edge held up pretty well with very minor damage to 13 out of 14 teeth big blue needed 11 seconds to cut through the clean wood the nail slowed down big blue quite a bit and then needed 19.5 seconds or 8.5 seconds longer to cut through the nails big blue slowed down quite a bit more in a second pass to 22.42 seconds unfortunately the blade causes quite a bit of vibration and the saw blade actually came loose midway through the third pass tightening the blade it finally finished the job in 70 seconds four out of five teeth in the big blue experienced some damage amanda tools needed five seconds to cut through the clean wood the blade needed 7.24 seconds or 2.4 seconds longer to cut through nail embedded wood on the first pass it slowed down by nearly three seconds on the second pass to 10.09 seconds it took even five seconds longer in the third pass finishing in 15.5 seconds nine out of 14 teeth on the mana experienced some minor damage after cutting through three feet of material and 30 nails all the blades lost quite a bit of speed but the hercules made the fastest third pass at only 4.81 seconds diablo is nearly as fast at 4.96 seconds evolution 5.16 spyder 5.62 and dewalt 6.89 seconds now that each blade is cut to 30 nails let's test them again cutting through two by fours without nails beginning with the milwaukee before cutting through the nails the new milwaukee cut through the one foot two by four in only 2.56 seconds after the wear and tear of 30 nails it needed over twice as long or 5.52 seconds the hercules was slightly faster than milwaukee at 5.42 seconds the evolution is over a second faster than the milwaukee and the hercules at 4.4 seconds the master force was pretty quick through the first half of the pass but slowed down quite a bit as the blade heated up the blade coating seems to be causing a problem for the master force 9.17 seconds the new dewalt needed 2.59 seconds and it needed 5.47 seconds to rip through the 12 inch 2x4 the new diablo blade needed 2.47 seconds and it's the second fastest blade yet at 4.71 the new spider blade was very fast at 1.95 seconds and moves into the lead over the evolution with a 4.25 second time the new bosch edge cut through the 2x4 in 7.18 seconds and it slowed 39 percent to 11.71 seconds the new big blue blade needed 11.07 seconds and it only slowed down 15 after cutting to 30 nails the new amana blade took 4.94 seconds and it needed nearly twice as long at 9.89 seconds so after cutting 30 nails the spider is the fastest blade ripping a foot long 2x4 at only 4.25 seconds evolution was a close second at 4.4 diablo 4.71 hercules 5.42 dewalt 5.47 in milwaukee 5.52 sometimes demolition work involves cutting through shingles so i'll attach two layers of shingles on the top of this pallet and we'll make three passes through the shingles after the blade cuts through the shingles we'll see how the blades perform ripping clean two by fours now that the blades have made three passes through the shingles in the palette let's see how fast the blade cuts through a clean foot long two by four the shingles really took a toll in the milwaukee slowing the blade down from 5.52 seconds after cutting through 30 nails to 10.74 seconds after cutting through the shingles the hercules slowed down quite a bit as well from 5.42 seconds to 8.97 seconds after cutting through the shingles the shingles really hurt the evolution slowing it from 4.4 seconds after cutting through 30 nails to 11.6 the shingle scraped away a lot of the green coating on the master force and it actually improved its speed from 9.17 seconds to move into the lead with an 8.3 second time the dewalt didn't slow down nearly as much as the other brands the dual went from a 5.47 second time to move into the lead with a 7.81 second finish the shingles really hurt the diabolo slowing it from 4.17 seconds after 30 nails to 9.12 after the shingles the spider was the winner of the last round and delivered a pretty strong finish this time at 8.57 seconds to move into third place after cutting through the shingles the bosch needed 24.85 seconds the shingles really slowed big blue from 12.97 seconds before the shingles to 39.57 seconds after the shingles really slowed the amana tools blade from 9.89 seconds before the shingles to 21.65 seconds after cutting through the shingles so after cutting through 30 nails and 18 feet of shingles the dewalt is the fastest blade at 7.81 seconds master force came in second at 8.3 spyder 8.57 hercules 8.97 and diablo 9.12 seconds while shingles and nails cause a lot of wear deck and drywall screws are a lot harder than nails and can quickly destroy a saw blade each blade will cut through just three deck screws and we'll see which blade performs the best beginning with milwaukee and the milwaukee needed 17.74 seconds to rip the foot long 2x4 with three embedded deck screws the hercules was actually slightly faster at 16.07 seconds unfortunately the evolution overheated when it hit the second deck screw and it really struggled to finish the job 71 seconds the master four slowed down quite a bit after hitting the second deck screw finishing the cut in 18.61 seconds the dewalt made the fastest time yet at 11.05 seconds the diablo barely edges out the dewalt and moves into the lead at 11 seconds the spider really slowed down a lot after hitting the second deck screw finishing the cut in 16.5 seconds the bosch made really slow and steady progress and finished the cut in 41 seconds pig blue slugged its way through the deck screws finishing the job in 54.3 seconds just like the bosch the amana tools blade made slow and steady progress finishing the job in 41.6 seconds so the diablo came in on top at 11 seconds but the dewalt was a close second at 11.05 hercules third at 16.07 seconds spider 16.5 in milwaukee 17.64 seconds now that we've tortured tested the blades cutting through 30 nails 18 feet of shingles and three deck screws let's see how they perform ripping through a clean 2x4 beginning with milwaukee and the milwaukee made the cut an 8.97 seconds taking nearly four times as long as when the blade was new and the hercules was nearly two seconds faster than the milwaukee at 7.09 seconds and the evolution made the fastest cut yet at 6.08 seconds and moves into the lead the master force made fairly quick work of the 2x4 at 7.19 seconds moving into third place behind hercules unfortunately dewalt must have experienced some damage cutting through the deck screws and needed 56 seconds the blade was dragging so badly that the saw began moving backwards unfortunately the dewalt's patented body slot technology caused the problem the body slot is now warped and causing the blade to drag i actually tested the blade twice just to see if it would perform better and unfortunately it didn't it took the diabolo 8.1 seconds to cut through the 2x4 which is two seconds slower than the evolution the spiders started off okay but really began to slow down about two-thirds of the way through the cut 15 seconds for the spider the bosch needed 28.3 seconds to finish the job [Music] big blue needed 108 seconds to cut through the board amana tools needed 23.03 seconds to cut through the 2x4 so after cutting through 30 nails 18 feet of shingles and 3 drywall screws the japanese made evolution came in on top at 6.08 seconds hercules came in second at 7.09 master force 7.19 diablo 8.1 in milwaukee 8.97 seconds another way to assess blade performance is to compare each blade to itself before the evolution was used to cut nails shingles or screws the evolution cut through a foot long 2x4 and 2.19 seconds after all the testing it experienced 178 increase in the amount of time it took to cut through a clean 2x4 hercules experienced a 215 percent increase diablo 219 milwaukee 248 and master force 278. i really like it when the most affordable products turn out being the best in this case the evolution performed extremely well as did the hercules i'd recommend buying either one of those blades both are definitely worth the money i also like the diablo a lot it performed extremely well and finally the milwaukee even though the milwaukee doesn't advertise use for demolition it performed just about as good as most of the blades and actually better than others all the videos in this channel are viewer suggested so if you have a video idea i hope you take time to leave a comment thanks so much for watching please take care and look forward to next time
