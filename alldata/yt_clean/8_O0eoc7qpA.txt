Poperechnoye / East Kazakhstan region / Kazakhstan Everything is in between the business... So they are there with their tomatoes... And the kids here are all sorting out The Village Poperechensky borscht! Everything is old...there's no time for something new. I sprinkle a handful or two, then add a little of this tea leaves and that's it! And beauty! And these are also non-locals, they lived in the city. Then they came here, as if they were living on her pension alone and... Every day, every day this drinking, this partying... Oh God, in general I... these people are generally surprised, Oh my God! Vinaigrette That's it, come on, enjoy your meal, because we lived among the Kazakhs, my mother... That's how the day goes by... Now the rain will stop, then you'll go! - There is already dirt there... And this is a bulkhead: large ones - separately, small things - separately, damaged ones - separately. Large - for money - Yes! -Medium - for ourrself. A small for the cow and the goats! The potatoes are stored temporarily. Then we'll sell this big one. There are no flowers there anymore! Yes....They...Don't be afraid... She's working with flowers over there! I'll even quarrel with her sometimes. I say, you will soon outlive me with these flowers! I think Olga even washes everything there with bleach. But I don't have time for it. Let's go, sit down at the table. Don't you have a cow's? - No, I don't have a cow's, I'm not leaving it now to whom? You and I are drinking goat's. No, what Old Believers are these days! -Now they simply don't exist, now they don't call them anything! Here is my granny, I can tell you something else: I have an older brother, we lived beyond Uba, and he studied at school here and lived with them. He told me everything: They will have lunch or breakfast, she (grandmother) says she will make everything crumbs, he says, to collect from the table and put in your mouth, as they say... Well, that's how it was... Those, they are Old Believers. And what the hell am I already! This is from the father - yes, they are Old Believers. -Farmer nickname -That's when we came here -We registered farming...so they still call us farmers But in general, everyone here has their own nickname In the village they definitely give it -By character -Yes, yes, by business... By your last name they will say - you don't know: who is this and who is that? And when they say the nickname - Ooooh, that's who it is! Okay, we won't name nicknames... The Kerzhaks had... they didn't give their dishes to anyone! And no one takes my glass either! And my granddaughter gave this to me, you see, to my grandfather, read it (The very best dear grandfather) And no one takes it And no one takes my glass - And this is so, one might say, jokingly. -Yes! - What is the former!... Well, after all, the remnants of traditions... Well, how can I say, are they traditions or... No, on the one hand it's just a joke... I'm even here when strangers or someone comes and I say: what a Kerzhak I am, you see! I don't let you sit in your own place, I don't give you my glass - Well, a personalized glass, how to take it... - Yes, a personalized glass, good girl, mistress! What, my dear. No, there's nothing. That's it, your sides are already bursting. You're already so fed up, like I don't know who! Beauty! let's go here . I looked, and there, indeed, the Old Believers were real, they were visiting.... I don't like that she was caught! Always breathes like that when you catch her! Still snorting! -My! I included the link for mom! Why do I need them now? You can... No, here! I'll take it for mom... And yours... I'm not going to fight. Don't cut your fingers off! -How? So that everyone knows about everything! -Hahaha, the way you dress! The wind doesn't let me do anything at all! Go launch one Now! I know how! Let's go, come in chuh-chukh-chukh! Let's go, go to your place, what are you doing? Go to your place! Made in the USSR Loch is destiny! Vinegar 3 buckets of cabbage, 3 buckets of oil! -Yeah damn it, I wonder how you're going to mix it all up! So it will shrink, now I'll pour boiling water on it. It won't shrink that much, Lena, believe me! Good! Otherwise there will be a devil! Well, let him look at Uba, he won't go to Uba on foot across the river there! Let me help you! -No need That's all! Now that's it for the winter. True, like coffee! Here are the cedar cones, you see. They were collecting them, they are wet, the nut is already molding. Let's go, let's go. -Let's go, where? Start feeding the cows and calves! Start giving everyone something to drink before it gets dark. So, now you have to deal with yours. Open up! Close up Yasha is the poop! Go open it! Village Ariston!

But if it sits there, it won't be the same! You will eat! He even knows how to swim! -Normal twist, what are you doing! The vitamin salad with some water, it would disintegrate in the microwave, then it would become normal Grandma, oh grandpa, do you have all the channels or not some? Marusya reads there and cries!
