Hello, we are AU! And today we'll be reacting to -Let's go! -Woah. The blood makeup. Woah! Who's that? Oh, wow. The bite is so real. -I love it. -Transition. -I know. It was really good, though.

Wow. -Total black. [They're new.] [They moved here from Seattle.] [I tried to look them up on social media.] We're just like. It's actually really cool. [They never talk to anyone [Anyway, look at this cute bag I found.] -I love it. Usual Lena. I remember it, yeah. It was a long time ago. Where are they? [Hello.] -Whoa. -Super sexy. It made the skin like they made the skin more kind of pale. -I don't know how they did that. -I remember. -Oh, the &quot;Twilight&quot;. -Bella Swan. Cool guy. [Chelsea.] He never talks. What? So mean. Sorry, but I wanted. -What will happen? the first scene that we shot -With lenses? Yeah, and I felt like kind of like I was like, oh man is this, -Yeah, I remember that. -Alan, where is your teeth? -Wow, I love it. Me too. -I was so scared, Alan, sorry. of Chelsea and Alan -It's like so good. Thank you. [What's...] Oh My God, [Breaking news!] -Wow, Tsengune! -He's our coordinator. J-Hope! Oh, no, look at that. -I remember the day when we were filming this scene with Lena. It's too much blood. -I'm scared of everything, actually. -Oh, no. Haha, Bella. We filmed that in our old college, Why you did that to me? Oh, that was so-- Oh, but we actually filmed these locations like all around Los Angeles, in the park, our old college, USC. Fight on! Yeah, that's where we filmed that shot. It looks really beautiful. -Who are they? Run away! -Bad boy. Roma! There's just like people I love the added laughs. Oh no! -Wow. Wow. This editing is so good. No way, my friends. What are you doing? There's like people walking around. It's a true friendship, I guess. Oh, the drama happening. Wow. How could you? I hit you. Oh, the coolest part. Oh, no way. Wow. Oh, your hair. This is so funny. Wow, that was cool. Wow. A vampire. I love Kolya's just like... And Chelsea's like... My hands on the table. Wow. That was so cool. Wait, how does this happen? Is it just editing? When he- So mysterious. No, I run really fast. Oh, you're a vampire. Sorry. It's all real. I like the fashion in this episode. Like, it's super cool. The outfits. Yeah. Eight oldest vampires ever to exist in the universe. Eight oldest? Wow, is it the Chat GPT? A.I. over here. Chat's for vampires, I guess. Oh, wow. 1964. Alan, how old are you? Yeah. That's not that long ago. But kind of. I guess he's 17. Wow. Oh, suddenly. Whoa. If I were Chelsea, I would really be scared So mysterious. What would you even do in that situation? I think- Serious guy. I'll just follow you. Well, really, your skin is so pale. Yeah. So good. He's just real. Yeah. [You'd think I'd be living in some mysterious city.] Alright, it's time to say that you're a vampire. [It's just an ordinary apartment where my family and I live.] I remember, it was hard to say that line. An ordinary apartment. They didn't see her? Red wine? -I remember this part we're filming. Was she hiding inside the refrigerator? I think so, just to be young, you know. She's a vampire. She can be invisible. Oh, some secrets. Secrets? Vampire's Diaries. Alyssa's mom. Alyssa's mom. She's our first aide. I like this. I like this part. It's so good. How come you're in the past too? No, it's not me. What are you talking about? Maybe he's also a vampire. This part, the editing is super good. Yeah, yeah. [And she appeared.] Picture is so good. [Kate.] Kate? Wow. I still want to have those photos, actually. I love them a lot. Yeah, me too. Yeah, you guys look so good. So cool. [Being a vampire.] I saw Alan at USC. I remember walking there with vampire makeup on. Everybody were like, um. Yeah. After Vampire Lessons. It's like, do vampires exist? Oh, I remember. It was ticklish. You know what was, it was actually pretty hard to film and put the lenses on and off like outside in the cold. I remember. What was your guys' experience like filming like outside in the cold? It was not that cold during like this episode. Yeah. But I feel it's still like when we're filming outside there's too many like factors that can distract us. I remember putting the blood like Alan. I love this part. Oh yeah, oh yeah. [All the bruises on my body disappeared except for this scar.] Oh, I remember I learned these lines right before. -Yeah. [We've become like brother and sister] Brother and sister?.. -But why are they... Oh, no. [It's too hard for me to control myself.] Are you hungry? A little bit sexy vibe. He disappeared again? -What? It was transitional. This looks like Bella Poarch's room. I think. I think it's a hospital room. Yeah, that's true. Aw, a little teddy bear. -Sneak around. -Is it... Is it Nick? Mister? You said &quot;mister&quot;? Mr. Nick? Mr. Nick, are you a vampire? Oh! -What's gonna happen now? Who was that? Someone kidnapped Chelsea? -How come the class only has two students? [Where's Chelsea?] [I haven't heard from her since last night.] Oh no. Ditch class. Wow, where's she? Wow, everyone just has access to her room. Yeah. How does everyone know where she lives? Chelsea, stop giving keys to random people, even though it's her classmate. Why did the phone let him have flashbacks? I remember filming this scene. Me too. My running! I was wearing big boots. So I was running. Oh, your rock. Oh. This one scene we were filming for four or five hours. -Yeah. Yeah, late-late into the night. You know way too much. Ah, it's a kiss? I started thinking about the kiss... But no. [Today I'm gonna destroy you and your relationship with Alan.] I think I don't want to destroy Chelsea because I have another goal, by the end. Oh, what is that? -Oh, I remember it. No, Kate, another hit. No, no, no. [Do you know what this is?] [This can kill you in just five minutes.] Wow. Oh. It's just some Diet Coke. Okay. You do you. Wow, the makeup looks super good. I love this part. [Just be quiet and it will all be over soon.] It was a hard episode to film like in terms of acting like what do you guys remember in terms of the acting? The hardest part for me was to really like grab Chelsea or like to grab her face or to be really evil at her just because like if I grab I really like grab and I also feel like &quot;sorry, Chelsea&quot;. I think I remember...This is not the only grab, there's another grab coming. Oh! Sorry. Oh, yes. But, you know, I think the beautiful thing about our team and us is that we always give 110%. That's true. You know, I think the audience feels it too. Wow, it's a double grab. Wow. Oh, my gosh, I could see that grab. Oh, I thought... Oh. I love this. I love that shot. Where you like, shoot back? Brave on fire. Ah, a little too cold. [The poison has already entered her heart.] Wow, the voice. [She only has ten seconds left to live.] -Woo, Katya! I love it. Oh wait, but it went to zero. Oh wait, yeah, yeah. It's been a while, it's been a while. It's been a while. While you were lying. Yeah. I don't even remember. Our hair is different. And the most romantic moment. The makeup, Chelsea. Wow, all the heart emojis. I remember that was also painful. Yeah, sorry. -I remember we had to do it a couple times- to have the teeth in the shot. [Chelsea.] [Chelsea.] [Chelsea.] Oh, I remember- This was actually super- Yeah, I almost cried. [Chelsea!] Chelsea! She's still alive. She's a vampire. No way. And she can spend her whole life with Alan. And now she can fight back. Yeah! Yay! And now they have cool eyes. Oh no. Jealousy, jealousy. Wow. Wow. Her pound just had. Wow. [Click here to watch another episode of Alan's Universe.] That was really, really good. Honestly, like you can see like the huge level of difference when we turned up for this episode. Like, I feel like that was awesome. My favorite part, I think, was the flashback. Whenever we have the flashback to how the vampires first started, I think that part is super cool. Yeah, I think that's one of the main parts, the end, let's just say. The jealousy, the happy, happy end. Kate, I'll be back. It's so interesting what will be in the future. So I think it was not the part but all of the editing that relies to like vampire thing like movement or lenses or like Alan doing like- This was good. I think my favorite part is the beginning where Alan and Katushka kind of like introduce themselves to the vampires. And then like the looks that everyone like gave each other and like the little like dialogue we had... That was my favorite part. My favorite part is like all transitions when you become a vampire from a human, like all this red eyes, the teeth, the blood, everything is like so cool. And I remember how we shoot the part when I was like lying in the forest. Oh, yeah, it was super cool. Thank you guys for watching.
