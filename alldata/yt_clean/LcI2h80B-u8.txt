No.. no.. Lia is angry because I didn't let her eat her crayons. Here.. I told her many times to not eat her crayons. Actually, I did like this: mouth, no! (2x). She respects, but sometimes she picks up the crayons, and she does like this, for example: Now it's almost 6pm. It's 5:35pm. I will consider now beginning of our bed routine. Guys, I'm speaking English because now it's English time. I'm recording at night. I have a routine, you know that. Morning is Portuguese, and afternoon and night, English. I'm preparing Lia's bread. I make a coin bread. Wait a second, let me take my wash gloves. I'm washing dishes. It was stuck. My Gosh! Guys, this is almost the end of the day, please, this face.. So, I pick up this bread, I put in the airfryer. It's done. So, coin bread. I cut it into small pieces. When Lia sees something that is round, she calls it a coin. So, guys, the bread turned out like this. And this is a cream cheese. I'm going to give this to Lia, and I will not open this little door. I will just jump it. Sometimes, I get lazy to open it. Do you want to eat your coin bread? Now, Lia is watching Miss Rachel. Soon I'm going to turn off the TV, and we're going to read some books. How was the walking with Puding? // Good. Jun explains to me why Puding only pooped once during the walk. And, he peed as much as he wanted. // Okay. Puding, stay with daddy! Guys, we need to be very fast with Puding. He still Lia's food. They, literally, fight. Lia squeezes him like this. Because Puding also has no shame, guys. Puding steals food from her hand. If she puts it in her mouth, and it sticks out, he takes it from her mouth. She is eating. Well, now I turned off the TV because she only has the right to watch one hour in the morning and one hour at night. Because in the morning it is Portuguese and at night it is English. So, she's a kind of lucky kid. She can watch for two hours during the day. The lights here are off. It's for her to understand that night-night is coming. Her clothes are on the floor, and the crumbles are on the sofa. The little angel is running away from mom. So, I still have house chores to get done. Folding the clothes I wash today. Do you want to show your new friend, Lia? Who is this one? // Owl. What is the owl's name, Lia? &quot;Vaca&quot; = Cow. Vaca! You can't name the owl a &quot;Vaca&quot;. &quot;Vaca&quot; ... &quot;Vaca&quot; ... Cow.. What are you thinking? Up, up, up. TV time is up. You know that, the time is up. Lia, you can't watch more TV. I need to turn off the TV now. Today I was organizing Lia's cabinet, and I found more clothes that are her size. Here we have a situation about Lia's lengths. Sometimes the pants fit, but the sweatshirt doesn't fit all the sweatshirt fit and the pants are short. So, I need to buy in advance and keep trying every month to see if some clothes or some part of the set is fitting or not. I always check her. Okay, okay. This sign is the signal that the washing machine's door is opened. What is the on your head, Lia? What was that? // Frog. Why do you have a frog on your head? There is a frog on your head, Lia. Why? What is that on the floor? // Frog. Where is Lia? Found me! Frog.. on.. on... Frog.. Frog// Lia, what's wrong with your hair? Lia, do you want to Mommy read a book for you? One.. Seven.. You have 30 minutes left before go take a shower. On.. On.. where.. Where could my frog be? Where is it? Where is your frog? I don't know where is a frog? You should know where a frog is. You found it. You found your frog. I know. // You know what? Ok, &quot;Sapo&quot; means frog. Now it's time to give a shower to Lia. Let's take a shower, Be? No.. Let's take a shower? // Let's go? No.. // Yes, Be. Let's take a shower. Yes, every day is this tantrum. No.. Book // A book? Yeah, Mommy will bring books. I want to read in Korea for you tonight, is that okay? Monkey.. Next one.. No! No, what? What's wrong? Grandma (in Korean). Ah, do you want English? Shark. Lia. // What? Daddy came. // It's time to sleep. it's time. // No.. Lia, you can sleep hugging your owl. So, Lia, good night. Lia. // Owl. / Good night, guys. Puding. While Jun convinces I opened the Puding's room's door in case he wants to go pee and drink water. Jun is trying to make Lee sleep. He always succeeds. Sometimes, depends, it can be in 3 minutes or in one hour. Now, it's time for me to study. I'm still studying Korean and Italian. And reading a book in English. So after that, we're going to have dinner and head to bed. I go to sleep early, like 9:30pm or 10:30pm, and Jun will work till 2am. And Puding sleeps with us. Do you want to go to try to sleep again, Lia? I'm being ignored. She wants to read a book. Do you want to Mommy read for you? Sure. Okay, let's read. The Itsy Bitsy Spider... and wash the spider out. The spider went up they spout again. Again! That's right, Be! Another book or all done? All done. All done? Frog. Do you want to Mommy read the Frog? It's Korean, Be. Is that okay if I read it in Korean? Do want to give you water to frog? Lia, can I have water, please? Please.. Water (in Korean). Where's my kiss? Give me a kiss. It is so good! That is it! Thank you for watching this video. I hope to meet you soon! Bye bye!
