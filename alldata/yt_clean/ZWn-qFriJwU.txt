Aren't you a tall drink of water? What you do'in? What? I'm married, darling. Me too. Yeah. Mhm. Where's your husband at then. He's in Sacramento. Where's your wife. My wife is standing right over there staring at you. I'll handle this. Don't do that now. I'm gonna. Hey! Lloyd. Hey, Lloyd. We're done. It aint midnight yet. Midnight enough. Get your hands off me. All these great ranches that you worked at, Walker, why not go back to one of them? Why don't you get my truck? Mm. Cause I can't leave the state. There's plenty of ranches in Montana. Nah, just because they wouldn't have you. Why is that? I'll start making phone calls. I'm gonna find out about you. Well, I reckon I got a fondness for the farmer's daughter. Yes, we got that in common, don't we? Come on. I'm gonna tear your f***ing heart out through your throat, Walker. I'll show that little f***ing knife up your ass. This goes down. We got to pick sides. I'm on whatever side you're on. You won't die today, Walker. You'll have taken your last step. Let's see what kind of cowboy you are. In a wheelchair. There you go. Done with this place. You gonna shoot me in the back, old fart. Go for it. I thought take a walk was a metaphor. You actually meant it? Nope. Oh. Oh, it was a metaphor. Familiar position for you. You smug, spoiled, 40 year old adolescent. You're everything that's wrong with this place. The only thing wrong with this place is you're in it. Nine years of jujitsu. B*tch! Aah! Ow! Ow! Ow! I grew up with three brothers, you f***ing hippie. You! Get. Aah! Aah! Whoa! Aah! You know it's going to happen, don't you, sir? I suspect it's happening right now, rip. I'm sick of listening to it. Get it out of their system. Nothing gets out of your daughter's system, sir. Excuse me. Ah! Ahh. You want us to get in there? No. This needs to happen. Jimmy! You f***er! Crawling out, you hear me? Call em out, Jimmy! Get him! Yeah! Oh, no. Yes! Right there. Let's get out of here. Get his ass! Yeah. Get his ass. Get his ass right there. Right there. Get that son of a b*tch!

Let's go! Ahh! You're going to live up to the brand or I'm gonna f***ing take you back. You hear me? You can see things haven't changed here. Pull up a chair. Actually, uh, I'm gonna need two chairs. Why? Uh. Oh, come on. Rut-ro. Oh, that's gonna go over like a fart in church. Everyone, this is Emily. She's a vet down the 60s, and, uh, she's my fiance. Oh, sh*t. No. Go go, go. No fighting. Oh, just let them fight their f***ing ass. F***ing ass! Come on, Emily. I got 20 on Texas. No no no no no no. Yes. F***ing barrel racers. Come on. Ho ho ho! Whoa! Freaking man. Well, sh*t. Always good to exercise after a long drive. What are the chances there's some whiskey in here? Chances are good. Nice hook. Oh. Looks like this one's free. Huh? It is now. What's the game? Whatever you want it to be. Yeah. All right. Here's your chance. I know how much you like it when I got my back turned to you. Let's dance prick. Boy. Get over here! Ah ah ah ah ah. The only painless way to learn this lesson is to watch it. Dah dah! Ah! You ain't done. Wah! Wah wah. Oh. Ah! F***! F***! Ah ah ah ah. Get up. Gotta be f***ing kidding me. Motherf***er. Oh. You're f***ing dead, man. Ah ah ah ah. I'll f***ing shoot. It will be the last f***ing thing you ever do. You better get after it then. Too late. Which one of these assholes is the boss of you? Which one of these motherf***ers? The big guy with the beard. Oh. Him. Him. Get up, get up, get up. Uh uh uh. I'm gonna give you one last chance. You leave now, or you never leave. I'll bury you. Will you f***ing stand. The f*** out of here? You heard him. Go! Get out of here! Let's go! The f*** out of here. Huh!
