The German Messerschmitt me 262, Sleek, fast fighter technology. For the Allies the appearance deal of anxiety and consternation. Nothing The top Allied fighter at the end of the war of 446 miles an hour. The Messerschmitt 262 which of 568 miles an hour. An advantage of almost this performance which is a Quantum jump can finish combat as it wishes. It was a very formidable world's first jet fighter it was in fact the kill credited to a jet fighter goes to the August 4th 1944 flying officer Dixie Dean V1 flying bomb sending it crashing into the While the V1 was a pilotless aircraft it would versus Jet encounter. It was a telling indictment. the Germans found themselves with just one only a handful were in service. But there was before the Me-262. The Heinkel He-280. Designed miles per hour. At this late stage of the war in September of 1940 it was two years ahead Was it simply indifference on the Luftwaffe's by political interference, incompetence or we must first look at the state of military the 1930s. Since the end of the first World War aircraft beginning of the 1930s new engine designs monacoque airplane revolutionized aircraft Speed altitude and range records were smashed. new designs and as Europe crept toward War to rise. With little time or money left for the development work focused on the evolution of the piston of a jet engine the thing. Technically unfathomable were those whose pipe dreams would become RAF applied for a patent for his jet engine. and his secret jet engine patent in the University of Gottingen was instrumental of leading German aircraft manufacturer Ernst Heinkel. to Heinkel whom he knew and he said you know I think has a tremendous future to it. He he engine it draws air in the intake compresses with with gasoline. And it turns the turbine comes out the half end of it. As long as you I have a man here who who wrote a thesis about It'd please me very much if you if you would his ideas and his applications for future inventor created a line of experimental centrifugal with ever more thrust. The entire program was utmost secrecy. The German air Ministry was was also unaware that BMW was working on their unit more complicated than the centrifugal It was also being developed with the full axial flow designs would power Germany's fledgling before the war the Germans had become aware Has been pioneered by Frank Whittle and at of centrifugal flow. Which is a the simplest the most reliable. At that stage certainly turn quite rapidly after their first um if flow type. Which really offers many advantages on axial flow engines. And within the limitations very successful in this. The only problem was therefore difficult to produce time-consuming strategic materials to contain heat stresses Work on a suitable test airframe for Heinkel's at the same time. By August 1939 both engine no masterpiece. The short fuselage and stubby of speed. On August 27th test pilot Eric Warsitz the tiny aircraft. Watched by Ernst Heinkel began to roll. The takeoff run was short climbing once and came in for a perfect landing. Total made. Wasting no time Heinkel telephone Ernst supply at the RLM the Reich's air Ministry. enthusiastic. The world's first jet would have into war. Long before 1939 the name Heinkel had become had gained a worldwide reputation despite Aviation by the Versailles Treaty of 1919. a number of new military types for countries in 1933 and the expansion of the new luftwaffe Orders for Fighters and bombers began to pour He-111 bomber were very good they lacked what about high-speed flight. Well heinkle he loved in into aircraft that were they were Fighters that sort of stuff like the Focke-Wulfe 190 was a man consumed by speed. The faster an the first flight of the He-178 he created in 1939. Unfortunately for Heinkel official all work on the project seized. Udet, Goring and were propeller people. They believed and Alternate Engine Systems. They said no And and so Heinkel was looked upon as some was doing on jet engines they they felt was never got any real support from him from the to power a new requirement for an ultra modern response was the He-112 powered by a 695 horsepower was the Messerschmitt Bf-109 also powered very close while the Bf-109 was slightly faster Superior field performance. Amid General surprise awarded the new contract. The Heinkel 112 was Reichlein test pilots endorsed that view entirely. point of view, Heinkel's 112 was number It also marked the beginning of a new and and the German air Ministry. Undeterred Heinkel the lack of enthusiasm from Ernst Udet and air Ministry. Heinkel pressed on with his privately time the Messerschmitt design Bureau completed air Ministry. Submitted on June 7 1939 the a contract for three airframes was awarded Simultaneously and in the face of official contract. Even before the official contract on the first He-280 prototype. The He-280 was the jet propulsion the He-280 was equipped tricycle landing gear. Prior to its first conducted. Fitted with dummy engine Nacelles He-111 and subjected to a number of gliding was ready for its first flight. With just enough air after a single low altitude low speed was the world's first jet fighter, but the a state-of-the-art machine which no one developing their jet technology, the allies in England Frank Whittle like Ernst Heinkel The new Jets were not a high priority. Frank's 3rd 1940 the British Air Ministry issued Britain's was selected to meet specification E.28/39. Design Frank Whittle and Gloster aircraft. The The engine mounted behind the cockpit and like the He-280. Air for the engine was drawn on each side of the cockpit. Like the Heinkel world's first technology demonstrator aircraft.

Which developed aircraft by any standard two examples were off from Cranwell Airfield at 7:45 PM the Thomas of Whittle's Engine pushed the air Ministry the first E.28/39 took shape. Specification F-940. 1940. Because the new jet engine didn't have have to be a twin engine design. the F-940 was Following accepted aircraft practices it was received an order for 12 Gloster Whittle would become the first Gloster Meteors. was not proceeding smoothly. When the contract to Messerschmitt that BMW had been unduly was still unreliable without sufficient power. In order to accommodate the new larger engine original airframe. The new aircraft would be nacelles just like the He-280. While BMW struggled company was working on their own turbojet. case the BMW 003 failed on November 1940 the Major problems were revealed and just as the first Me-262 V1 was fitted with a nose-mounted Willie Messerschmitt was hoping for. On April To impress his guests Heinkel arranged for a the He-280. During the mock combat the He-280 completed three. Finally, Ernst Udet showed some 77 more than the Fw-190. Impressed the German 13 He-280A pre-production aircraft. Unfortunately, was still out of reach. Heinkel now found himself and incompetent leadership. To understand this beginning of the new Luftwaffe. After Hitler leader of the new Luftwaffe. A World War one a number of his ex-quadron mates titles in of the first.
