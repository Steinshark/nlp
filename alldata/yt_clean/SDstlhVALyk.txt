In some cases, human traffickers would abduct women and hide them there, forcing victims into prostitution. The Imperial Court has sent many people to clear the area, however unsuccessfully. To this day, all forces are at odds. A catastrophe has befallen the world. A crisis is imminent. The root of all evil started with the Ghost Dungeon. Run! Come on, let's go. Let's go! Run! They're catching up! Faster! It's okay for now. There's something underwater. Hurry! Anyone? Help! Help me! Anyone? I can't believe she made it this far. Piss off. Don't delay our schedule for a woman. Yes, Master. You like to run? I have to rein you in. Mrs. Yang's beauty is from heaven! So beautiful. Hey. Look at the wine. It's floating. Floating? Yeah! Amazing. Incredible. Fantastic. I've never seen anything like it. Look, it's snowing! Hey, where is she? Heh. Great! Commander Lu, you've been quiet. Are you finding my little show lacking for you? Commander Lu. Commander Lu. He's drunk, he's drunk. Commander Lu, Commander Lu? Commander Lu! He froze to death! Mister! Come on. Close all four doors. Protect Lord Marquis. What's going on? After Mrs. Yang made it snow, Commander Lu froze to death. Weird. What do you mean, Mr. Zhang? Are you suspecting Mrs. Yang? I didn't mean it like that. I'm just stating the facts. Commander Lu is the Minister's protege. Someone dares to assassinate a court official here. We have to investigate thoroughly. Jiang Cheng, where's my wife? I have a report! Lord Marquis, Mrs. Yang fainted in her room. Since the murder took place in Lin'an, call on this city's Magistrate. This is he. What do you think? This is a strange case. I have a candidate for this case. My top arresting officer in Lin'an. Who is it? Shen Mo. Who wants to bet? Me! Who are you betting with? Her! You still dare to bet with me? Not only that, I want to raise the stakes. Whoever loses leaves a finger here. Don't regret it. Since you two have made a deal, let's get started. A bet is a bet. Let's not get ugly. Bet on big! Small! Big! You win! You're playing dirty. If you lose, you lose. Don't be a jerk. Chop it up! You lose, you pay. I'm sorry about this. Wait a minute. Let me get in on this bet. Who are you? Court official? What a good bet. Now that I've met you, someone's finger is coming off for sure. Get the knife. How dare you chop off my finger? You said you need to chop off a finger. You didn't say whose it would be. Don't you play dumb with me! Don't move. The case of missing women in Lin'an. Every clue points these two. This couple of large and small men. Talk. Who put you two up to this? Talk! So it's you. Shame. You're beautiful. Come on. Yes, sir. Take her back. Who's Shen Mo? Limbs askew. Pale skin that looks like chicken. Varying degrees of frostbite on the surface of the body. Postmortem lividity are dark red. Bright red blood in the left heart. Dark red blood in the right heart. He froze to death, yes. But... A trickery to the eye can't do any real damage. The party started only two hours ago. But his body doesn't look like he's been dead for just two hours. Mr. Lu. Could you please tell me what happened? Okay. At the time of the murder, Mrs. Yang was here. Oh, no. The killer was here. She was dancing. And suddenly there's snow. And then, after the song ends, Commander Lu was frozen to death. And then the killer just disappeared into thin air. Lord Marquis, I have a few questions for your wife. What questions? Ma'am, do you remember how you passed out? I was in my room dressing up for the performance. Suddenly I smelled something, like a fragrance. And then I remembered nothing. Fragrance? A drug. Mrs. Yang. Have you ever been out of your room? Can anyone prove it? We've been standing outside the door. No one came out of the room. Darling. Sheriff Shen, my wife isn't feeling well. Let her go to her room and rest. Mrs. Yang. Do you know anything about illusions? Sheriff Shen, is my wife in the clear? Yes. What did you find out? Commander Lu died last night. He died last night? We were just having a drink here. The party started only two hours ago. But to form postmortem lividity of Commander Lu's magnitude would require least twelve to fourteen hours. He was moved to the scene. Who could move a body? Last night, when I was drinking with him, he was still healthy. And we came together today. Yeah, that's right. We just had a drink together. It could be done. It's unbelievable. Mrs. Yang doesn't know how to do illusions. And she has an alibi. So who is the Mrs. Yang you all saw? Then someone must have disguised as Mrs. Yang. Even the Lord Marquis couldn't tell. It means this person is very good at disguise. Since Mrs. Yang could be disguised, why couldn't Commander Lu? That makes sense. So who's the killer? Commander Lu has been dead for a long time. The murderer was able to disguise themselves as him. And they can seize the moment to put his body in position during the dance. This means the killer's still at the scene. Lord Marquis, we found Commander Lu's clothes in the side hall. Give it to me. Mr. Lu, you said you came here with Commander Lu. Anything unusual with him? There was nothing out of the ordinary. He didn't talk to me much. But he smelled like woman's fragrance. Fragrance? The killer was able to change clothes in a short period of time. And no one noticed. That means they're very familiar with the Lord Marquis Residence. This is an inside job. And their clothes were heavily scented. It also means that the murderer is most likely a woman. Mr. Jiang. Could you please call all the women in Lord Marquis Residence here? Yes, sir. Who is it? What happened to you? Mrs. Yang wasn't feeling well. I was anxious to see her. So I fell into a ditch. What's your name? Dongqin. You smell good. It's not me. I've been out in the hall. I've never been in here. If that's the case, come here. Tie the killer up. Why are you tying me up? You killed people. If not you, then who? I just said, any woman who smells like fragrance could be the killer. But you said you fell into a ditch. You want to hide your fragrance, but you can't hide the smell of alcohol in your mouth. What kind of maid would dare drink so much during a party? Only the murderer who disguised herself as Commander Lu could have. So you're the killer. Lord Marquis, she's dead. Lord Marquis. This case is closed. The murderer, Dongqin, has been brought to justice. How dare a servant murder a commander? Someone must be behind this. The murderer deliberately moved the body into Lord Marquis Residence. She's obviously trying to frame Lord Marquis. I think the case is still open. Yes, this must be investigated. Report! Lord Marquis. Sheriff Shen, you have seven days to find out who's behind this. If you can't find it, you would be at fault. Yes, sir. Dongqin must have had an accomplice. Otherwise, a weak woman like her, how could she overpower a strong man? Don't forget, Zhang Tianru drank with her all night. Lu Juexiao was drunk. How can he fight back? Then maybe it's Zhang Tianru. No way. He had no reason to kill Lu Juexiao. Also, it can't be Mrs. Yang. Mrs. Yang is beautiful, pretty and gentle. And those soldiers said so, she was in her room all the time. It can't be her. The nicer a woman is, the more she lies. Who cares? Shen Mo is here. He can investigate. Once the case is solved, I could be promoted at least three times over! Shen Mo, don't worry. If I got promoted, I'll take all of you with me. I won't forget you. Is that right? Then I'd like to congratulate you, Mr. Lu. Thank you, Shen Mo. Do you have any money on you? What do you need money for? I'll buy you a coffin. Or should I wrap your body in grass? What do you mean by that? One is the Lord Marquis, who holds a heavy army. One is a high-ranking court official. No matter who it comes down to in the future, it won't be someone you and I could afford to offend. So guess who's going to take the blame? Not me, anyway. Hey! Shen Mo. So what are we gonna do? I'll give you one word. What is it? Run. Run? See for yourself. The Lord Marquis' soldiers are everywhere. Where can we run? Go check it out. Where are you two going? Take me with you if you're running away! Wait for me. Kill them. Don't bother with them. Let's go. Okay. Watch out! Who are they? Looks like it won't be an easy case. Tomorrow we'll go to the Lu Residence first. I am so tired. What are you two doing? Again? Hey, wait for me. Minister. You're here. You're just in time. This flower finally bloomed last night. Congratulations, sir. It's about time. This is fate. Sir, everything's done. It's time to fertilize this plant. When do you think we should do it, sir? The Lu widow, you could pay her a visit. Yes, sir. Wait a minute. What's this? This is wine from Commander Lu's ice cellar. He's gone now. Mrs. Lu asked us to get rid of the wine. You can go now. Commander Lu is not an extravagant guy. His house is simpler than yours, Mr. Lu. Hey! What do you mean by that? My house is nice because I have good taste. Besides, all that stuff at home is on my father-in-law's money. I am not corrupted. Who knows? What are we looking for here? Let's take a look around. Okay. Last night, when I was drinking with him, he was still healthy. And we came together today. This is wine from Commander Lu's ice cellar. He's gone now. Mrs. Lu asked us to get rid of the wine. Step aside. Shen Mo, you...! Don't you think this bookshelf is a little odd? What's odd about this? You're making it complicated. Oh, my! Can a commander make so much money? He's really corrupted. I can't earn half a wall of this in five lifetimes. Why is this box on the floor? Was there a thief here? No way. Why would a thief leave all the gold bricks behind? Yeah. The culprit left all of these gold bricks untouched. They only took what's in the box. That means it's important. Do you guys think Dongqin killed Lu Juexiao because of this thing? It's possible. Lu Juexiao doesn't have it on him. This is the only thing the killer took. That means they're familiar with Lu Juexiao's situation. So they are most likely someone inside the Lu Residence. Dongqin was responsible for the killing. This person took the object. I think, once we find this thing, we should know how he died. Mrs. Lu? Let's just ask Mrs. Lu, then. Mrs. Lu, has anyone been missing from the Lu Residence lately? Missing? That's right. Master's concubine, Yingying. After he's gone, she disappeared as well. Sir. That bitch had everything to do with Master's death. Did she take anything with her? There's nothing missing. That night, when Mr. Zhang of the Ministry of Revenue and Commander Lu were drinking together, do you know what they talked about? We didn't talk about much that day. Mr. Zhang. We had some drinks, then we got tipsy. I went home after that. Mr. Zhang. My friend. I never thought that day would be our farewell. Sheriff Shen, I'd like to say one more thing. The illusion might be fake. But you can't fake a human being. That night, Mrs. Yang said she fainted in her room. She never went outside. Do you believe that? Of course, that's just my guess. Don't take it to heart, Sheriff Shen. After all, Mrs. Yang is delicate. No one would consider her a threat. The prettier the woman, the better she is at lying. No wonder you're so loyal and honest looking. You...! Sir. Something's wrong. What? Something's happened at the court. I need to go back and take a look. Shen Mo, I'll leave it to you. Let's go. Yes, sir. So where are we going? To Lord Marquis Residence. Sheriff Shen. How's the case going? Why are you checking back into the Lord Marquis Residence? I'm taking a couple of guys to get some statements. It's just a process. What's there to see? Prettier than you, anyway. I want you to get another statement from those two guards. Yes, sir. I want you two to go over the events again. At that time, when Mrs. Yang went into the house to change, we were staying right here. Shen Mo, take a look. Look at this painting. Is it the same as the one on Dongqin's chest? What kind of flower is this? It's a marjoram. From Xixia. Xixia? I think she's in cahoots with Dongqin. A painting doesn't prove anything. It could be a coincidence. Look somewhere else. Shen Mo, do you think it could be drug? Shen Mo? Shen Mo. Stop looking at her! This is the incense that beautiful women use on their clothes. There's nothing to suspect. Forget it. A manly woman like you wouldn't understand. You...! We're investigating a case. No need to get testy. Investigating? You're here to gawk at Xiang Chang'er! I'm here to see if there's anything unusual about the suspect. Don't you want to combine work and rest while on a case? Get out of the way! Sheriff! What are you guys doing...? We're doing a simulation. Something wrong? We're done with the statements. Ask again. Yes, sir. Let go of me, you perv! Shen Mo, you...! You asked me to let go. You're the eldest daughter of Qiwei Armed Escort Agency. Why are you here working as an officer, anyway? What do you care what I want? Do you like me? As if! Boss. I got it, I'll ask again. No, it's not what you think. Go on, again. Mrs. Yang's maid came out of the room after a while. Then Dongqin came to rush Mrs. Yang. Hey, wait! Come back! Boss. What did you just say? I was just saying that Dongqin came to urge Mrs. Yang to come on stage. Dongqin was here? Only then did I realize that Mrs. Yang had fainted in her room. Go ahead and make a pledge. I'll be right there. Something's off about Xiang Chang'er. I didn't suspect her before, because the guards said she never left the room. And she didn't know Lu Juexiao before. Until just now the guards said, Dongqin was the first to realize Xiang Chang'er had fainted. Then there's only one possibility. Xiang Chang'er and Dongqin are working together. First, Dongqin disguised as Lu Juexiao to attend the banquet. Then Xiang Chang'er disguised herself as a maid to mislead the guards. Followed by an illusion at the party as the distraction to help Dongqin place the body. After everything was done, Dongqin pretended to urge Xiang Chang'er to come on stage, attracting the attention of the guards. Xiang Chang'er took the opportunity to sneak into the room, pretending to be fainted. Of course, it's all just speculation. Luo, keep an eye on Xiang Chang'er. What about you? I'm going to the Magistrate's office. Go back. Don't push. Don't push. Go back. Shen Mo! You're finally back! What's going on out there? They are the families of the missing girls. But the guys at the casino won't talk, no matter how hard we try. It's killing me. Leave it to me. Okay. All pretense. You were just eating. Everyone knows how to do that! It's just a dance. I can do it too. -Check it out. -Yes. Nobody's here. Hurry, get me something exactly the same as the woman a moment ago. Do you want it a smaller size? Are you looking down on me? No, it has to be exactly the same. Boss. You guys are inhumane. Were you torturing them? Trying to beat him to death? They won't talk. What else can we do? You have to know that outlaws won't succumb to a little beating. Boss, what do you have in mind? Alright. I'll teach you a lesson. Step aside. Today, I'm going to teach you some new tricks. This is called, fighting fire with fire. Boss, are we going to torch him? The so-called &quot;Fighting fire with fire&quot; isn't really using fire as a method. It's to imagine myself as them. Think about how they torture people. Then I'll return the favor. I heard that you guys use mercury all the time. Why don't you try it yourself? Straight from the mouth. Mercury would go down your mouth and throat. To your heart, liver, spleen and lungs. What would it feel like? Or it could seep down your skin and into your flesh bit by bit. By then, your body would feel like it's being bitten by thousands of ants, gnawing on your bones. So excruciating. We should try them all. What do you say? Let's begin. Here it comes. Here it comes. No way, you fainted? I haven't even started yet. Alright. Since you're awake, why don't we start with you? Wait, I'll talk! Then talk. We're follow the Dealer's orders.. She's in charge of contacting shipments. We will collect the goods. Then she sends them to the Rouge Store. The people who were sent it were heavily guarded. We haven't been able to find them. Sir, I've told you everything I know. Please let us go. Interrogate the Dealer. You remember what I just taught you? It's your turn to practice. Yes, sir. Hey, wait a minute. Blindfold her. -It's gonna be gruesome. -Yes, sir. Okay. Bring it over. You guys are pretty soft. What did I tell you? Start again. Until she talks. Yes, sir. A beautiful woman suffers while I watch the view. I can't bear it. I'll talk. You want to talk now? Tell me, who do you contact with? Where are the girls? Still won't talk? I think you haven't had enough. Why don't we try again with a different leg? Together. Faster. It's the Ghost Dungeon. Those five women are at the Ghost Dungeon. -Untie her. -Yes, sir. I didn't cut you at all. It's just water. A little sound is enough for you to assume it's really happening. A beautiful woman like you, I'm not cruel enough to do that. What's this? It's a gift from the Master. What does it stand for? I don't know. Lady Mo. Who did this to you? What? Em. It's okay. The Ghost Dungeon is the mastermind behind the Dealer. They kidnapped and sold women, forcing them to work at brothels to get information. Under my government, I can't believe there's such a nasty place. To be honest, just because it's under your government. Hey, Shen Mo...! Madam, family members are not allowed in here. - Shen Mo...! - Let's get down to business. We have to go to the Ghost Dungeon. You... You'd better change. You! He...! This is it. Don't play games. It's fine. Lead the way. These two want to make a big deal with you. They want some two-legged sheep. Okay. Come with me. What kind of two-legged sheep would you like? Our goods excel at all types of arts, beautiful in every way. What is a two-legged sheep? It's a lingo, means woman. Did any of these catch your eye? They're no fun. Any newcomers? You've got a good eye, sir. Let's go. Do you think she's Commander Lu's concubine or something else? You all have to die. You all have to die. You're dead. You all have to die. Lin Shuang'er, trained for a year. Sent to the Prince Residence. Mu Dongqin, trained for a year. Sent to the Lord Marquis Residence. Dongqin came from this place, too! Only after these women are trained, branded, can they get out of here alive, and gather information for Ghost Dungeon. According to the Dealer's statement, it's a single-line structure. It's extremely secretive. Let's go. Enough. Let them in. Help me. Let me out of here. I beg you, help me! Please help me! Help me, please help me. I heard that someone wants to make a big deal with me. I didn't expect it to be the famous Sheriff of Lin'an, Shen Mo, Sheriff Shen! It's no fun. Mr. Shen, you didn't come here to look for anyone, are you here on a case? I want to know where the Lu concubine is. She's dead, but she left something. That stuff? Do you know the rules of Ghost Dungeon? Yes, name your price. I don't want money. I want... Her! Please, Mr. Pole. I won't take your love. You shouldn't have asked for mine. Then, we have nothing to talk about. Wait a minute. On the day of Lord Marquis Residence's incident, I saw two thieves on the street. They look a lot like the two behind you. What do you think will happen if Lord Marquis finds out? There are a lot of people who look alike. Even if you're an officer, you have to have evidence. That's true. But for Lord Marquis, that's not the case. In my opinion, it should be a good deal for you. See them off! I've been through hell for this piece of crap. From yesterday, it's almost night time now! We didn't get anything out of this rag! The Ghost Dungeon trained abducted women, and sent them all to brothels and dignitaries to gather information through sex. This is how the Ghost Dungeon operates. Do you think Xiang Chang'er is also from the Ghost Dungeon? Xiang Chang'er's identity had already been cleared. Although she was the top courtesan at Changle Brothel, she was from an ordinary family. Xiang Chang'er's identity has yet to be confirmed. Lu. Lu! What did you find out? I can see that this is top-quality Southern Fleeting Brocade. Wearing this brocade, walking in the sun, could reflect a colorful light. It would be the most extraordinary. This is good material. Very good, indeed. Is it working? Nothing. Hey, let me do it. Neither soaking nor burning works. All right, leave us. Yes, sir. I think it's just a piece of rag. Hey, hear me out. Could this be the waistband of a rich man's pants? No, no. Could this be a headband? No, no. Or on the wrist? This isn't pretty, though. - That's... - Wait a minute! What's going on? Luo. Give me your sword. Hold it. I see. This needs to be wrapped around a certain item to be interpreted. If it's a secret letter from the army, naturally, it should take a sword to work. Let me see. March, Shaoxing 9th year. Yang Jun dispatched troops three days ahead of schedule, disobeying His Majesty's orders. April, Shaoxing 9th year. Yang Jun forged military intelligence, ordering 3,000 soldiers to go up north. He stationed 13 miles outside the Capital City. He harbors treacherous intent. Lu Juexiao was the Commander. He had evidence that Yang Jun disobeyed His Majesty's orders. So he threatened Yang Jun with it many times in exchange for a wall full of gold bricks. When Lu Juexiao realized that Yang Jun was determined to kill him, he gave the evidence to his concubine, telling her to move the evidence. Lu Juexiao wanted to negotiate with Yang Jun at the banquet. But he was killed there. So what you're saying is, the real killer of Lu Juexiao is Lord Marquis? No, we can't go on. No more investigation! We can't go any further. The Lord Marquis is a powerful man. We should be sucking up to him instead! But why did Lord Marquis do this? He knew he was guilty, trying to use us. Mr. Lu, Lord Marquis wants Sheriff Shen to come to his residence. He said he had something important to discuss. We'll see if he's the real murder. Give me a copy of the evidence. Why am I doing the copying? Sir, Shen Mo found evidence of Yang Jun's crimes. Now he has concrete evidence. He did a great job solving the case. However... Say what you want to say. But our spies said that Yang Jun invited Shen Mo into his residence. Tomorrow, go to the Magistrate's office and find out what's going on. Yes, sir. How's the case going, Sheriff Shen? Have you found the killer? It's almost done, sir. Who's the killer? Yang Jun, Lord Marquis of Chongfu. You mean me? Okay, tell me about it. Lu Juexiao is the Commander of the Army. He had held you back on many occasions at the border. In addition, he repeatedly threatened you with evidence of you disobeying His Majesty's orders. So you wanted to kill him. In the Imperial Court, plenty of people are targeting me. According to you, I should deal with them all. - What's this? - March, Shaoxing 9th year. If Lu Juexiao reported you to His Majesty for treason, I'm afraid it would be more serious than using you as a target. Bullshit! What does Lu Juexiao know about timing in a battle? If I had to be held back by him during any battle, the Song border would fall many times! Even if I want to kill him, a random accident on the battlefield is enough for him to die many times. Why would I go to all this trouble to kill him at my birthday banquet? I don't need to make things hard for myself. They say you are Lin'an's top arresting officer. Looks like it's all in name only. You do have a point. Do you have any political enemies? Political enemies? I've been guarding the border for years. Politics is not my forte. I may not see eye to eye with the likes of Ministers like Shi Miyuan. - Minister Shi? - Yeah. Lu Juexiao is his eyes and ears in the army. Thank you, Lord Marquis. I have an answer in mind. Sheriff Shen. Are you here to interrogate me? I wouldn't dare. I'm simply discussing the case with you. Besides, you didn't ask to see me just to ask about the case, right? What do you think? There was another incident on the day of the banquet. I don't understand. Lord Marquis, what was missing here that day that's making you so nervous? The Military Defense Map. Military Defense Map? This case is not that simple. What did you say? It doesn't matter. I'll take my leave. Thank god you came out in one piece. Otherwise, I'm going in. Thank god you didn't go in there. Otherwise, I'd be in real danger. What's wrong with you? I'm trying to be helpful. You're so ungrateful. Yeah, yeah. I'm grateful for the protection of Lady Mo of Qiwei Armed Escort Agency. That's more like it. Is Qiwei Armed Escort Agency stationed at Yumen Pass? Yeah, why? What are you doing? We don't have much time. Mr. Zhang seemed to be asking for something from Master. I snuck into the north section of Ministry of Revenue. The Register of Li Village says Xiang Chang'er is from an ordinary family. No, that family doesn't have a daughter. Xiang Chang'er paid a lot of money to have that gambler lie for her. - Xiang Chang'er is from Xixia. - Xixia? Who had such power to forge identity for somebody from Xixia? Zhang Tianru. - Mr. Lu. - What's the matter? Mr. Zhang from the Ministry of Revenue is here. - Mr. Zhang. - I heard there's progress in the case. Did Sheriff Shen find any important evidence? Mr. Zhang, I'm mad simply talking about Shen Mo. Evidence? Shen Mo can't even find anyone from the case! Mr. Lu, this evidence implicates the crime of disobeying His Majesty's order. It's about the safety of the Song Dynasty. Are you trying to hide the evidence and cover up for the murderer? Mr. Zhang. The evidence is with Shen Mo. He's out early in the morning. He hasn't come back yet. Don't worry, sir. I'll send someone to look for him. I'll send the evidence to your residence. The Minister is already working on this case. Mr. Lu, please stop when you still can. Mr. Zhang. Mr. Zhang! Mr. Zhang! Please say something nice for me in front of the Minister! This is getting out of hand. Now Minister Shi is involved! We need to dump this case! But what if the murderer is Minister Shi? Minister Shi and Yang Jun don't see eye to eye on politics. So he sent Lu Juexiao to collect evidence against Yang Jun. Before the incident, Zhang Tianru and Lu Juexiao had drinks together. They looked like they were catching up. He's actually being asked to turn over the evidence. But Lu Juexiao was blinded by money. He refused. So Zhang Tianru got him drunk. He left to escape suspicion. Then Dongqin put the unconscious Lu Juexiao into the wine cooler filled with ice, he froze to death. Xiang Chang'er and Dongqin's identities were forged by Zhang Tianru under Minister Shi's orders. They had been in Lord Marquis Residence for a long time, waiting for the right moment. No. Xiang Chang'er is a favorite concubine. Why didn't she just kill Yang Jun? Xixia is watching like hawks. Minister Shi didn't want Yang Jun to die. It's just a way to diminish his excessive military power. He got rid of the disobeying Lu Juexiao, blamed Yang Jun for it. Two birds with one stone. Wrong. It's three birds with one stone. Lu Juexiao's death caused chaos in Lord Marquis Residence. Old Pole took advantage of the chaos and stole Yang Jun's Military Defense Map. Military Defense Map? Minister Shi is colluding with Xixia? If that's the case, we'll be sinners of history by handing the case over. We'll get to the bottom of this. Shen Mo. What should we do? - Let's go to Minister Residence. - Just us? Me alone. I'm going too. You're not need here. You won't help much. Sir, I went to the Magistrate's office to ask for evidence against Yang Jun. That Lu Yue talked in circles. Shen Mo is also avoiding me. I'm afraid it doesn't look good. Find a way to get that kid here. Yes, sir. Minister, Shen Mo has come. Get him here. Yes, sir. I didn't expect this is how we first met. You didn't expect a piece would jump off the board himself? Everyone is a piece on the board. You and I are not immune. You used Xiang Chang'er to kill Lu Juexiao. Blamed it on Yang Jun to seize military power. Good plan, sir. You can't say that. I didn't kill him. I'm just a man in the know. Xiang Chang'er is willing to sacrifice herself to keep both countries at peace. She's loyal. Do you know why you were chosen to investigate this case? It's because you would risk anything to get to the bottom of things. You're the only one who can find out about Yang Jun. You may not know this. But I don't investigate people. I only care about the truth. Do you really believe that I care about power? General Zhao has been guarding the border for ten years. He's loyal to the Song Dynasty. On the other hand, Yang Jun coerced His Majesty to hand over half of the troops to him. This time, he stationed the troops outside the Capital City. If he goes north, there's no way Imperial Guard could hold him off. Sometimes the truth doesn't matter. Lord Marquis. Shen Mo has found out who's behind Commander Lu's murder. Minister Shi wanted to use Commander Lu's death to frame you. He created chaos on your birthday, let Xixia's people steal the Military Defense Map. Jiang Cheng, help Sheriff Shen arrest him. Yes, sir. I'm sure you've all heard it. Minister Shi wants to rebel. We must clean up His Majesty's Imperial Court. Yes, sir! Where's the Military Defense Map, then? What? The Military Defense Maps is gone? The day of the banquet, it was lost it when Lu Juexiao was killed. So, we've all fallen into Yang Jun's trap. It was all his plan. He deliberately leaked Military Defense Map to Xixia. If that map reaches Xixia, I'll be accused of treason. And Yang Jun can take advantage of the opportunity to send troops. No. His Majesty is in danger. Sir, Jiang Cheng has surrounded the Palace with his troops. Where are you going? Sheriff Shen, don't take the wrong side. This is crucial. Jiang Cheng. Do you realize you're working against His Majesty? Once Xixia attacks, our people will suffer the most! None of you will jeopardize Lord Marquis' plans. Shen Mo, are you okay? What are you doing here? Are you following me again? I told you not to come. It's dangerous. I'm worried about you. If you get hurt and die, I need to know who did it. So that I can avenge you. Should I say thank you? - Arrest them all. - Yes, sir! - Don't move. Yes, sir. Don't move. Take them down. Yang Jun really is going rebel. Sir, what should we do? What's important now is to stop Yang Jun from mobilizing his troops into the Capital City. But Yang Jun is in control of the army. How do we stop him? I have an idea. Why are you here alone? Who else are you expecting? I guess I underestimated you. This is a good plan. A plan within a plan. I'm impressed. Shi is trying to kill me. I had to make do with what I've got. It's a done deal now. The moment there's a report of war at the border, Shi Miyuan will fall. There's one thing I don't understand. How did you know that Xixia was trying to steal the Map? Shi Miyuan was going to make a move at my birthday banquet. So I ordered my men to reveal the location of the Map. People from Xixia would definitely take advantage of that. But if the Map falls into the hands of Xixia, the border you were protecting would be breached. Aren't you worried at all? Tell you the truth, that Military Defense Map is a fake. Those people at the Imperial Court, all they do is begging for peace. They hold back we generals at every turn. The territory of the Song Dynasty is stained with my blood. It's stained with the blood of our soldiers. When my army arrives, I must clean up those useless Ministers. But your soldiers won't arrive. You must intercept the Military Defense Map at Yumen Pass. The Military Defense Map hadn't even left the border. So what? I have gathered all the generals. We have enough men power to take over the city. Lord Marquis, you're planing to diminish Minister Shi's power under the pretense of protecting His Majesty, so there's no one left to fight against you. Then you can take over the country. This is treason. Even if it is, what can you do about it? Come in. Drag Shen Mo out and behead him. Yang Jun conspires against the country. Who wants to conspire with him? You tricked me! Shi Miyuan, you old thief! Generals. The Capital City of Lin'an is just ahead. We're already here. Are you going to give up the victory when it's so close? Listen, everybody. It's Yang Jun who's committing treason. I am here to guarantee that those who do not know the truth are innocent. I'll kill you! Go get him! Let's go. Get 'em! If you want to die, just come at me! Slow down. - A couple more. - Coming. Minister. Shen Mo, you helped a great deal in capturing the rebels. You deserve a big reward. If you want anything, just ask. Thank him, quickly. Thank you, Minister Shi. This is the result of your wisdom. I am just an arresting officer. I was just doing my job. If you want to reward anyone, Mr. Lu and our brothers should be the first to get credit. Shen Mo. You're young and talented. I should... Minister. I'm in a hurry. I'll leave you to it. Are you going to Ghost Dungeon? Yes. In the Ghost Dungeon, there are still many women in captivity who need to be rescued. I'll go with you. Let me finish this. Goodbye. Why are you leaving so soon? I'll take my leave as well. Shen Mo! Wait for me! Shen Mo. Shen Mo! No greed, no grudges. This kid's a real talent. If he can be of use to me, he could be a talent. Mr. Shen. What are you doing? You're the source of many evil, you stole military intelligence. Today, I'm going to eliminate your for my country. Let's see if you have the skills for it. Yo! The honorable Mrs. Yang is here as well. It's been a long time, Master. It's been a while since I called you that. I've never seen a rebellious dog coming back home. What? Are you not happy with being a pawn for Minister Shi? You treacherous traitor! Have you forgotten how I taught you? Have you forgotten what I've done for you? Do you mean how you kept asking me to kill people, trade my body for information? In those endless nights, I couldn't sleep. For every piece of information I sent out, every time I killed a man, I asked myself, what's the point of me doing this? Cut the crap. No one gets out of here alive today. Kill them all. Even if I die, you can't save Song. Song is dead. Brothers, take these women and leave. Let's go. Are you okay? I'm fine. Hurry. Get to shore! Xiang Chang'er, run! You guys go ahead. I'll hold it off. Let's go. Shen Mo, let's go! Come on! Shen Mo! Sir. It's all over. This may be the best ending for Xiang Chang'er. Maybe. This is only a temporary ending. I don't know how much longer the Song Dynasty has. What's wrong with Song? We're doing great. Hey! Can you teach me your trick with the token? It's a secret. It can only be passed down to males. Petty. Oh, no. I lost it. Forget it. What did you lose? Just teach me. Don't be petty. No. Teach me! You're too dense, you won't get it even if I teach you.
