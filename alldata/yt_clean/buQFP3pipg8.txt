If the green light is shining! Look both ways to stay safe. Just stop, look, and cross. That's the way! Every time I want to cross the street I wait at the crosswalk, by the stoplight. Gonna cross the road, count to the beat. Until it's my turn, I just hang tight! If the red light is flashing. If the green light is shining. Look both ways to stay safe Just stop, look, and cross.

I was enjoying some sun. The sun? Yes. That is the sun. [music] Big! [screams] Baby Bot? [cries] It burns. [cries] Bad sun. You touched the sun? Yes. Bad sun. No, Baby Bot. The sun isn't bad. The sun is great. You don't know anything about the sun? I know nothing! I'll enlighten you! You see, Baby Bot? We live in the solar system. The solar system? Exactly. The Earth and all the other planets revolve around one star. The Sun. That's right, Baby Bot, the sun is our star, and it gives us light and warmth. Without the sun, there would be no light on Earth, and it would be very cold. Imagine that! I make light too. But the sun lights up the whole planet. Can you do that? [background noise] No. Sunshine is great, Baby Bot. It makes us feel happy! [raining] See how sad everything is when there's no sun? Who could be happy in weather like this? La la la. La la la la la. [chuckles] Well... except for Cowy. I don't like the sun. Oh no! Poor flower. Oh... the sunflower, it's wilting. Of course! [music] [chuckles] Yeah! The sun gives light. Without the sun, there would be no animals, no plants and no friends. The sun is good. The sun, friend. Stop! The sun is great, but very strong. We have to be careful to stay safe. Ready? Ready. Drink water. Check. Wear cool sunglasses. To protect our eyes! Check. Wear sunscreen. For our skin! Check. Wear a hat. To protect our heads! Check. That's it! Sun, friend! No! Baby Bot, stop! Most importantly, no hugging the sun. Okay? Okay, no hugging. No hugging. But you know who you can hug? All of your friends! All of them? Yes, all of them. All of them? All of them. Yay! Friends!
