Egyptian scribes wrote hieroglyphs for three of history until they fell silent. Decades gasp in this temple, home of the last known not a story of loss but of success, a tale more importantly, how we know. There's a popular narrative about the rediscovery an Englishman and a stone. The first time to some documentary, you know, one where the temple walls then cuts to a bright sunflare It went like this. In ancient times, the hieroglyphs when Napoleon invaded Egypt. A stone was found, the puzzling strings of birds and snakes and scripts and, auspiciously, a rough translation Young both raced to unlock its secrets, tediously mysterious Egyptian symbols. By most accounts, of Egypt was at long last restored! Oh, past self, I know you were cozy and awestruck. hmm, you think I'm about to say wrong? No, not that, more...missing something hiding in plain sight in history and even those famed by asking a different question: not &quot;who deciphered do we know?&quot; 1810. Years before his celebrated decipherment hurrying through the streets of Paris. He's Abuna Yuhanna, Father John from Egypt, whose The abuna receives meager payments for his after him who have experienced their share has been sending much of what he earns back two deceased brothers. Champollion, as we see in his writings, is language, the very same one that stretches and that until he can dream in Coptic he will Coptic, to outside eyes, looks like Greek written in an adapted form of the old Greek and vowels, and that's about to become very of 25 Greek letters, Copts use seven letters of Egyptian signs. The first hint at decipherment. Champollion eagerly absorbs all of the grammar of work, it'll be by plugging in Coptic sounds will finally be able to peer back into the Major hitches impeded truly revealing their have parallels in Coptic, but what did they Consonants were merely pesky nuisances compared to this day. Hieroglyphs are a desert of consonants. scratched their heads and scribbled in some words. Not because they thought Egyptians to read Hatsepsut than ht-spswt. Arbitrary in these ancient gaps between the consonants? Well, since Coptic is Egyptian, and Egyptian time, Egyptologists could compare Egyptian and it resulted in an explosion of hieroglyphic one that built words using a template where consonants. Egyptians would then fill in that they didn't write those vowels, how do we a beautiful example like &quot;nfrt&quot;. Well, compare like /nafr@t/ or /nofr@t/. What about And name, &quot;rn&quot;? Why, it's /rin/. And &quot;kmt&quot;, about &quot;p-rmt&quot;, meaning &quot;the person&quot;? /p@ro:m@t/. as we'll learn your stories have a twist. Evidence also comes from the languages Egyptian and words they lent. In the New Kingdom, during dragged on between Egypt and the Hittites. treaty. They wrote this treaty in two versions: and on tablets in cuneiform. The elaborate words: nswt, king of Upper Egypt and bjtj, get written out entirely in syllables. After pronunciation like /nsi:? bijat/. Do you be dropping consonants, and presumably some It's evidence that the language changed over to Middle to Late to Demotic and Coptic. So Answers came from linguistic clues far beyond Over two thousand kilometers southeast of a cluster of languages grouped together under perfectly comfortable with their languages, To many, Omotic shares traits with a broad family Afroasiatic. But Omotic is hard to classify, traits reflected at all. So why this detour? call on Omotic are found in other languages. These traits echo in the streets of Cairo today, but Masri or Egyptian Arabic. Arabic is in by the way, it was in Arabic that medieval scholars hieroglyphs to Coptic sounds. Who else should have these family resemblances Egypt in its own branch. They compared to a common ancestor, Proto-Afroasiatic, leaving within a family. Now you could look for sounds You could also start to fast-forward down a more remote past, ancient even to them. Sure, Coptic easily fills in the /i/ in /rin/ are words where Coptic doesn't match the vowels many o's must've been earlier a's: , And do you remember the way I said the word for earlier /ra:mac/. And when I guessed that &quot;beautiful&quot; might be /nafr@t/ or /nofr@t/? Now we know why - it changed in stages from Scrutinizing sound changes gets tricky. Take something like /w_na:wat/. And now you know from my clocks video! Incompletely... because The uncertainties don't stop there. Why is there and which signs were pronounced /l/ in which periods? And what in the Duat is the value of this We're starting to miss the delta for the reeds. The key point is this. What I didn't realize, that it took all this, understanding Egyptian's to figure out that Aten's name was /ja:tin/, /?a:nakh/ and then later /?o:n@kh/, and that and its language /ra?niku:mat/.
