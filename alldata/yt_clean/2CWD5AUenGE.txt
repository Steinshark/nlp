Someone in this room has just And that's exactly what we Now, maybe you're like us and you've how eating certain foods can lead Well, this felt like an extremely Mythical experimentation. So, let's find out the truth, shall we? It's time for We're Not Just Bosses, We're Cool Bosses. Let's All Fail Drug Tests By Eating. Welcome to the Hugs, Not Drugs Zone. That's right. We are each gonna be eating something that supposedly can generate a false or an alcohol test. Emily, you're gonna be eating marijuana. Oh, I'm sorry, hemp. Rhett, we're gonna be eating heroin. I mean, I guess you don't eat heroin. We're gonna be eating poppy seeds. Right. And you guys are gonna be Stevie, and Lily, off of yeast. All right. And we'll each explain how these things might affect the test. So, poppy seeds, you probably. This is the one that I had heard of, okay? The one that you're like, you gotta watch out if because you might fail a drug test. Because, poppy plants, That's where they get heroin. hey make, it's an opioid. Well, specifically, poppy seeds come from the papaver somniferum plant or the opium poppy, Yeah. Heroin. And not, like the. the character in, like, fantasy. Like a female heroine. And we are going to be using spoons. And here's one thing to note about this, You can't, like, experience the effects of. There's no, if you eat enough poppy seed, Psychoactive effects? Yeah. The opiate effects or whatever. It's just because it's in your system, and that's what they're trying to And I will say, you will be fired on the spot, Yeah, to find out if I come stoned to work. I'm gonna wait on direct poppy that I might actually enjoy. What is this black vat of? Is that just, like, a poppy seed gel? I believe it's a pudding. Paste. Poppy paste. It's just a paste. I want to start with some, so I'm gonna start with this. It's so thick. What is it? Well, this is actually tasty. I am jealous, because you cannot smell through the screen, but durian smells quite terrible, it smells like a mix of garbage and cafeteria And the pizza is helping. Very horrible. But I'm consuming raw durian because if you consume enough, levels, and you can appear drunk when I want you to appear drunk. Yes. When you do it. Only when I blow into the Watch that finger, please. I'm chugging on heroin jelly. Oh, my God. This smells so bad. It's bad. It's so bad. Well, I'm consuming pizza. I'm very happy with that. I got the good gig. But the yeast in pizza dough promotes alcohol and other substances, hence causing the dough in your And then I'm supplementing malt balls to are they called malt balls? Yeah. Malted milk balls. Malted milk balls, To get my yeast levels up. I think I call it a Whopper. Yes, Whopper. That's the right word. Okay. I'm questioning the kombucha because there's There is, like, point zero, zero, zero. I don't know if it says it. Okay, no more kombucha. Okay, no kombucha. Let's just wait on that. Unless you're desperate to test positive. I mean, if we find out that eating a fail a breathalyzer, that's, like. Crazy. That's news. That is news. We'll get on the news. That would be awesome. What if that was the mission Oh, it is, Emily. If we get on the local news, like, Well, it depends on how local it is. Of course you have an Aunt Lynette. Yeah, you mean local to Harnett County. All right, Emily, what do you got? All right, in today's news, hemp seeds is a breed of cannabis with a THC concentration of less than Okay, she's high already. She can't read. Yeah, I can't read, I guess. However, those trace amounts of THC and hemp but can come up as a false positive. Boy. We'll be the judge of that. Was anyone else afraid Did we think there'd be a lot more drug This is my first test. This is the first drug test. It's hard to believe. At Mythical and maybe the This is the first one I've ever had, That's news. All right. This would be a funny thing to do, though, if you had a group of friends that you were trying to sabotage their lives. You know, like, if you really wanted. And they had, normal jobs where they got. Eat this pizza. Yeah. Because this is the only way to Because this would be the strangest I don't know. I'm having fun over here. I got hemp milk. Hemp seed, Can't wait.

There's no drugs. Bring your kids. Bring your kids. Test positive. Do you want some? I don't know how strong this is. Do I put this under my tongue? Is this a tincture? It's a tincture. I'll put just a couple of drops. It's probably gonna be really strong. Oh, my God. Is it really strong? Well, it's, oh, God. Okay, now I gotta try mine. Put it on top of your tongue. Because if you put it well, dude. You missed it. Okay, you're good. Oh, that is awful. I mean. What is the point of that thing? I mean, it's not durian. Concentrated. That's the thing. I was told. And I'm holding my nose. I can tell because you're. But I was told that if I held my nose, and that was a lie. Chase! I do like that, though. I would have some, but that's not my test. What? It tastes. Can you keep holding your Because I like what that sounds like. It tastes like it smells. It tastes really bad. Stevie, I really appreciate you taking Thanks. Thank you. Thank you. I'm gonna take this tincture. It doesn't say whether or not to put it under my tongue or what. Oh, I didn't read that either. It says, so. I imagine this is what a drug den is like. What's a drug den? Well, because it's a den. We have a couch, a coffee table. Oh, yeah. It's where the heroin bear lives. Oh, you're supposed. Oh, it was a cocaine bear. The kids call it an ideal blunt rotation. Yes. This is that. You're supposed to mix this with water, One dropper. And it's supposed to be calming. That's interesting. Lily, hold on.

She's peeing as close to us as she can. Maybe she'll turn the fan on. Oh, Lily's blowing. All right, so. Yeah. And so then, we stick it in there, and it will test for a We won't be able to Okay, I'm going to see if the mouth alcohol has left my system. After twenty minutes from the durian. I tested zero again. So I'm going to try some kombucha, yeast in it, and see if I can get a little register. What if I just discover that I'm always. Like, I have. It's zero. Okay, so it really. It's just for that time period. Okay, I'm gonna try this again. It's supposed to turn pink. Oh, it's supposed to turn pink? It turns pink. Really? It's like little pacifiers. I kind of like it. Mine is so wet. It should be soaked. Mine iss so wet. Oh, point zero one four. Okay, so kombucha is. You got to be careful. And I only drank a little bit as well, so. We're going in. What's in there? It's just like a hole. And you put this thing down in that, When you close this, it smushes all of the saliva down into all these channels. And then the saliva creeps up each of these test strips. Oh, I gotta turn this. And tells me. I mean, They're all getting wet down there. It's testing for BZO. Yeah, I see all the. CDC. Oh, it's coming up. It is coming up. So it works.

I am not amphetamined. Whatever bup is, What's bup? B-U-P? Synthetic opiates. That's a, so. That's the one we're looking for. Yeah. The only one that is. Look at that one. Yes. This one wants to be kind of positive. Same exact for me, but, that's still technically a negative. Like, that's still technically a negative. And in my opioid, my opioid is negative. I mean, I took three whole spoonfuls of that stuff, and a tincture. Mine is flirting with preliminary positive. See that? I have a strong line and Seems like only one of us won so far today. So, like, right there. I don't know if there's any way for but there's, There's a strong line, which means that, No, it's not. It tells me that if you that it can take you to Yeah, maybe if it was a daily routine. Hey, I'm back. Oh, here comes Emily. It took you that long to just? That was a long pee.

This lady just tested positive for THC. That's right. Hold on. Let me see that. Okay. I am a little. I am a little. I've wiped it off. So just that amount of hemp gave you a positive THC test? I drank two glasses of the hemp milk. I had four scoops of that, like you said, I did a full dropper of that, and then I had a half of So, I don't know. That's a lot of hemp. So with everything but the yeast, and I guess the kombucha. The kombucha tested positive. Yeah, so everything but the yeast gave a false positive. We saw an effect. In some form or another. I think that we would be able to talk I just ate three poppy seed spoonfuls this morning, Joe. Wait, you tested positive? I mean. Yeah. Oh, yeah. You were still peeing. Very, very.
