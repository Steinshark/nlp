Blind man. You've won so much money from the house. Why are you still here? Let's make a big bet. If you win, the money on the table will be doubled. If you lose, you will have to cut off your hand. The left hand or the right hand? Can this blind man do it? Blind man, you lost. It's all white. Even with so many people watching, you would bully a blind man. - Look, they cheated. How could they do that? I'm the banker here. I have the final say. Guards! Chop off his hand! How dare you! Boss, he... You couldn't beat him, so you cheated. If everyone was like you, my gambling house would close down. Sir. I apologize on behalf of these stupid men. Please continue playing. We will pay no matter how much you win. Are you the boss? My name is He Qiufeng. - This gambling house-- Goodbye. Are you from the gambling house? Even the boss is here. What do you want? Blind man. No matter how much you win, it is your money only if you can take it away. Got it. It's dark and the road is dangerous. Killing people is easy on rainy nights. Where is Ni Yan? Blind Cheng is a ghost killer. The world was in turmoil a few years ago. All provinces posted bounties to invite people from all over the world to capture criminals. A ghost killer, as the name suggests, carries out his tasks with a sword and trades his life for money. My name is Ni Yan. I met Blind Cheng when I was 19 years old. Is this it? Hurry up. How dare you steal the wine? Ni Yan, I'm sorry! I'm sorry, Ni Yan! Go pick up Wulang. - Let's go pick him up. Let's go. Hey. Come back. - What is it? - After you eat my dessert, - You will have to be my family. - All right? - All right. Go and play. - Let's go pick up Wulang! Hey! Hey! Old man, are you calling me? Old man? Do I look like an old man to you? You're even blinder than me. The wine smells good. Grapes? You have a keen nose. It has aged 81 days. I opened it today. Go and fill up my wineskin. How much is it? It's not for sale. Today is my wedding day. The wine is for guests. What a waste of wine. If you want to drink some, stay a little longer. We have plenty of wine. It's free. What do you say? Got it. I'm not your family or friend. I won't drink it for free. This money is a wedding gift. Go and tie the horse for me. No need for the gift. To congratulate me, say something auspicious. How about I kowtow to you? Every word is scathing. You are the same as my brother. Sit here. I'll add some fodder for your horse. Don't feed it. My horse eats meat rather than grass. Don't be afraid. There is a person inside. Who is it? He is an arsonist. I'm a ghost killer for Dali Temple. I caught him for the bounty. WANTED Are you off to pick up the bride? - Congratulations, Wulang. - Come to my wedding. - Congratulations, Wulang. Congratulations. Congratulations. Congratulations. Come to our wedding party later. Congratulations, Wulang! - Thank you. Come to my wedding. Folks, come to the wedding! Congratulations! Thank you! Isn't that him? Why is he here? That's right. How could he come? Ni Jun! Ni Jun. You received my letter. Why are you in such a rush to get married? Can't you live without a man? Wulang is nice. He's diligent and treats me well. Wulang! This is my brother. Ni Jun, from now on, I will take care of Yanzi. Young man, go ask around. I kill people without blinking an eye! If anyone dares to bully my sister, I'll Kill him. Ni Jun. Stand up. - Get up. Today is my sister's wedding. I'll pour you some wine later. Have a seat. Yanzi, we've had the wedding wine. You and your brother are finally reunited. We won't keep you. Goodbye. Goodbye. Let's hurry. Folks. - Everyone! Don't mind them. Who are you? They have all left. Why are you still here? Didn't you hear them say that I'm a jerk? I do bad things all the time out there. Your sword is too sharp. Don't hurt yourself. Drink it. It's wedding wine. The wine is fine, but the joy has nothing to do with us. Wine seller? Miss? Ni Jun! Let go of me! Ni Jun. Why did you run away while you had such an important task? When the coffin was opened, you Killed everyone. If I hadn't run, I would have died too. Why shouldn't you die? I can die as long as you let my sister and the others go. I won't tell anyone about those matters. Nor will anyone find out about them. Only the dead don't talk. Wulang! Bastard! Don't touch her! Ni Jun! Yanzi, run! Ni Jun! Yanzi! Ni Jun. Yanzi! Ni Jun! Ni Jun! Yanzi! Ni Jun! Yanzi. I shouldn't have come back. Don't move. You survived strangulation because your neck is tough. Everyone has their own fate. You're luckier than them. All right. Officer Gao. Officer Gao, have some water. - Take it. It rained heavily last night. Three more families are waiting. Without you, I wouldn't know what to do. My lord. What are you doing? This man is an arsonist recorded by 18 towns of Changzhou. The Ministry of Justice Here is the criminal. I'm a ghost killer for Dali Temple. This is the bounty notice. A ghost killer? Are there still ghost killers nowadays? He's blind. What's wrong with him? I was afraid that he might run, so I broke his arms and legs. Get him a doctor. It's clearly written here. He is a felon. Presenting his head is sufficient. Kill him or punish him, do whatever you want. I want to ask you something. Which one of you is Zhang Baishui? Is it him? Yes, it's him. Li Jiuzhou, do you think you can escape? What's going on? WANTED Blind man, take the bounty and leave. It's done. By the way, the wine-selling family west of the city was slaughtered. Is that under your jurisdiction? My lord. The Yuwen family did it. What should we do? Yuwen Miss, you have suffered a lot. When are you going to Luo yang to arrest them? I'll bury these bodies for you. You should let this matter go. What did you say? A life for a life. I just want justice! I can't give you justice this time. I've lived here for so many years. Now, I realize that this is a lawless place. If you can't give me justice, I'll find someone who can give it to me! Miss! On your wedding day, Ni Jun caused trouble here. Your husband, Li Wulang, died protecting you. Out of anger, you killed your brother. Am I right? That's not it! - Everyone in Liangcheng knows! Ni Jun is that kind of person! They will believe whatever I say. I won't admit it! Don't move. - Admit it. Save yourself some suffering. Let go of me! Let's go. We both know what happened. She is already miserable enough. There's no need to destroy her. What are you talking about? I don't understand. I have good hearing. It's none of your business! Let's go. Blind man, you shouldn't get involved in this mess. You should not stay here. Leave. You're incredible. I'll pay you. Kill them for me. No. I'm a ghost killer, not a killer. I want to go to Luo yang too. Take me with you. Why are you going to Luo yang? I'll report it to the officials. If they ignore me in Liangcheng, I'll go to Luo yang. If they ignore me in Luo yang, I'll go to Chang'an. It has nothing to do with me. Take me with you! All I want is justice. Take her with you! Blind man, do you have a family? Drink it while it's hot. Don't catch a cold. My brother said that every time I play the reed pipe, I'm talking to my deceased family. But even it is broken too. Give it to me. Don't be so superstitious. Here, two bowls of beef noodle soup. - Enjoy. - Make way. Here, wares for sale! Do you remember what I said? Yes. Repeat it. There is a public court at the end of the east market. There is a mounted drum at the door. Someone will listen to my grievance if I publicly beat the drum. Thank you for the past few days. I have to go now. Luo yang is big. Don't get lost. - I might not brew wine anymore. - You appreciate wine. - Take it. Of course. I raise the cows myself. - Come again. All right, I'll have two bowls. All right. Please come again. - Lady Qin. Lady Qin. - Hurry. - Lady Qin. - Lady Qin. - Spectacular! - Good job! Lady Qin. Lady Qin, I wrote another poem for you. - I'll read it to you. Your zither is fixed. Pick it up when you can. There is no hurry. Lady Qin. Lady Qin, wait for me. You're not Li Bai, nor am I Yang Yuhuan. - We're not meant to be. Lady Qin! - Lady Qin. Put it down. I just tuned it. Your rough hands might put it out of tune. Did everything go well in Liangcheng? That young man was right. Li Jiuzhou was hiding in Liangcheng's county office. You arranged it well. Here. The payment is in. The next job is a big one. When is it? I've sent a scout ahead. I'm guessing you can set out in three days. Is anything wrong? No. Remember to feed my horse. All right. Blind Cheng, we have news. The fugitive this time is well connected in Yanzhou. It will be fairly difficult. But the good thing is that the pay is high. With this job, we'll have enough to heal your eyes. This is the last job. Do you think that doctor can really cure my eyes? Of course. He's my grandmaster's senior. Without my connection, he would charge you another 3,000 taels. Stop bringing that up. What do you want to do the most once your eyes are cured? I want to see you first. You must look old after all these years. Stay blind then. All right, I'm leaving soon. Slow down. - Lady Qin! What happened? That bitch. If she falls into my hands, I'll kill her! Who offended you? Didn't you say that you got a job with the Yuwen family? How could you be bullied? Don't mention it. What bad luck. Today at Shouhua Mansion, Yuwen Xiong presented wedding gifts to the Guo family's third daughter. It was such an important occasion! - Halt! A woman barged in! Let go! Who knows what Yuwen Ying had done to her? It was a big mess. Hear my grievance! Of course Yuwen Ying wanted to deal with it right away. But General Guo said... Not today. Take her away and keep an eye on her. I'll preside over this in a few days. So... I can't kill this woman. Isn't that annoying? And then? Yuwen Ying told He Qiufeng to take her away. He's a bad guy. If anyone falls into his hands, nothing good will come of it. Who is she? She's probably Yuwen Ying's lover. She's quite pretty. But she must clearly be a whore! Get lost. It hurts! It's ready. Blind Cheng, stay out of this. In the past, you didn't want to get involved. I didn't tell you either. But now, I have to tell you. We can't afford to cross the Yuwen family. Why? The Yuwen family They helped the court during the rebellion. They have clan powers in Hedong, Shannanxi, and Long you. This marriage with General Guo's family is so they can gain a foothold Yuwen Ying is Yuwen Xiong's brother. Offending him means offending the entire Yuwen family. What do your words have to do with killing for revenge? It's a life for a life. You don't need to take 10,000 lives. Don't you understand that? More tea, please. Help yourself. I don't care. You should be going. Leave now. What do you think, buddy? I'll listen to you. Let's go back and take a look. Where is Ni Yan? I don't know. At the Dead Man's Place! She's at the Dead Man's Place! Miss. Miss! Are you there? They... forced me to admit to things that I didn't do. She won't die, but she needs rest. There is no time to rest. Pack up. I'll send you out of the city at dawn. From now on, you don't know me. We're not friends either. I'm sorry for dragging you into this. What's done is done. We can leave together. I have other things to do. Cheng Yi. I can't let you have your way this time. You must leave with me. My eyes can't be cured, right? I know. You want to give me something to live for. You mean well. Yes, I lied to you. I wish you could be blind forever. I wish to be blind like you. Nothing in this world is worth seeing and no one is worth doing this for. She's not worth it either! Look at her. Is she pretty? What did you say? I'm asking you whether she is pretty. I can't see. I only know that she suffered so much. All she wants is justice! I'll give it to her. Justice? Over the years, we have seen plenty of unjust things. Can you undo them all? Let's start with her. I can't see with my eyes, but I can see with my heart. All right. Let's stop here. Leave now. Are you really going back? Just pretend that I lost my way. Tell her that I'll avenge her. Off you go, buddy. Don't move. The more you struggle, the more it hurts. Do you know who I am? He Qiufeng. You come from three generations Because you are ruthless, Yuwen Ying plucked you out of prison. Who are you? It's my turn to ask you. Why did you kill that man from the Ni family? What happened with that woman? I'll tell you everything. Can you spare my life? I'm asking the questions. You should just answer me. It was Ms. Guo! Ms. Guo wanted the stars in the sky. So Yuwen Ying gave her a luminous pearl. It was dug out from the tomb of a Han dynasty lord. It's such a big pearl. How could we get one without raiding a tomb? For fear of bad luck befalling the Guo family, Yuwen Ying killed everyone who dug the tomb. Ni Jun supervised the tomb raid. He fled. We had to catch him. Yuwen Ying, I didn't think a loser like you could win Ms. Guo's favor. However, you're just like your mother. All you know how to do is steal. I'll let the stealing go. Why didn't you clean it up? Leave it to me. I'll take care of it. Where is General Guo? What do you want? I can take you there. Yuwen Xiong! He booked out the Ming yue Tavern! Yuwen Xiong-- Be gentle! Where is He Qiufeng? He was taken away by a blind man. A blind man? I've never seen such a powerful blind man. I... seem to know such a blind man. Right here. What a cruel blind man. After leaving the post house, the Eastern Pass My men are waiting for you there. What kind of person is he? He's a poor man just like us. Then why did he help me? Maybe... he doesn't want you to end up like him. Are you going back? The Yuwen family will catch up soon. Keep heading south. Don't look back. The blind man killed He Qiufeng to declare war against me. He must still be in the city. Set up ambushes around the city. In addition, the woman with the pipa can't go far while carrying someone. Chase her along the way. Find them at all costs. Understood. FULL Don't come in if you're not stupid. We are full. I'm looking for the boss. I am the boss. I'm looking for their boss. Who did you say you are looking for? General Guo. General Guo is not here. Where is that blind man now? Why are you laughing? I'm laughing because you're a dead man. Is that so? Don't you just want to know who the blind man is? I can tell you. Back in Sui yang, the blind man was called Cheng Yi. A pair of hands that could shatter bones, the Tingfeng Sword, and the Loulan Slash. It's you who has awakened this demon. I'm Cheng Yi I met you once at Dong jing Pass. I'm not here to curry favor with you. I have a few words for you. Do you know the man who will marry your daughter? The blind man has shown up. Where? Ming yue Tavern. You have no evidence. Why should I believe you? I will kill him. Believe it or not, it's up to you. The general is calling off the engagement. He specifically ordered to reward you. I've worked hard for ten years. But I've lost everything all of a sudden! Useless! Stop hitting. Useless! What is that? What is it? - Look. Look over there! Who is that? Isn't that Lady Qin? It really is Lady Qin. - It is. How could this happen to her? It is her. - Someone is dead. What happened? What do we do? There is a body. It really is Lady Qin. How could this happen to Lady Qin? - Who did this? Who did such a cruel thing? Lady Qin. Your zither is fixed. Pick it up when you can. MEMORIAL TABLET YUWEN FAMILY When my eldest brother died, he appointed me the head of the family. After the mourning tonight, anyone who Kills the enemy of our family will be added into our genealogy and rewarded 100 fiefs and 10,000 pieces of gold. YUWEN FAMILY YUWEN FAMILY The Yuwen family searched the whole city for you. No one dared to touch her body. In the end, Wuhou sent someone to reel it in. She is unrecognizable. Thirteen arrows. Each one pierced through the bone. I understand. MEMORIAL TABLET Blind man, do you want to keep playing? I'll send you to hell. I will definitely go to hell. But I have to take you with me! I have killed many people like you on the battlefield. You are no different from them. You came. Yes. You drank her wine too. What else did he say? He said - to find a good place, - Open a tavern... and make some good wine. If there is a chance, I would like to have a few more drinks. All right. Let's stop here. He was a ghost killer for ten years. He had saved up 9,150 taels of gold. He said it was of no use to him, so he asked me It's more portable that way. Also, your reed pipe is fixed. Keep it safe. Blind Cheng is a ghost killer. The world was in turmoil a few years ago. All provinces posted bounties to invite people from all over the world to capture criminals. A ghost killer, as the name suggests, carries out his tasks with a sword and trades his life for money. I met Blind Cheng when I was 19 years old.
