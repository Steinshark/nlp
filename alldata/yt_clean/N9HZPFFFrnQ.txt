By the second day, the cabbage had already released its juice well and increased in volume. Twice a day I take it and pierce it with a stick, releasing gases. Look, the cabbage will turn out without any foreign tastes or odors, and it will be very crispy. I'm covering it again. Hello, friends, Ukhty Kitchen is here! I wanted a tender pie with cabbage, and for it I will need sauerkraut. Now I'll show you how I make sauerkraut: I choose this flat, round, juicy winter variety of cabbage. My cabbage is very dense, crispy and juicy. Look how beautiful it is. We chop it with a knife, put everything on the table, just make it on the table. - Well, okay, is there a difference? - Certainly! These are the thin straws I have. Come on, don't play around, but get busy. Do you want some pie? - Certainly. - Well, then, three. This is not for you to turn bolts, this is art. - Turning bolts is also an art, I'll tell you. - I agree, everyone should mind their own business. - In short, honey, I did this job. - Well done, you like it! Remove the grater. I'll also use a knife in several places so that the cabbage isn't too long. Great, the next one is a grater. Small carrots, 100-150 grams, just right. Now I'll stir it a little on the table, my friends. Of course, I washed the table well. So juicy and crispy. I take salt - for 1 kg of cabbage I use 20 g of salt. Friends, mix everything well again, a little, without fanaticism. We want crispy cabbage, not rags. Once the cabbage has reduced in volume, you can put it in jars. And that's it, all you have to do is wait 2-3 days for it to ferment. We got a little cabbage, Seryozha. Nothing, No, it won't fit into one, I'll take the small one. I put the jars on plates because the cabbage will begin to rise during fermentation. I want to show you: when I press well, the cabbage is all in its own juice, so everything is fine. I cover with lids so that there is an outlet for gas. I'll leave it in the kitchen for 2-3 days and keep an eye on it. During these days I will do one very important action, I will show you later. I turn the oven on top and bottom, 180deg. Let it warm up and we'll start filling. Place a frying pan on the fire, pour a little vegetable oil, one or two spoons. Let it warm up, and in the meantime I'll do the vegetables. I cut one small onion into a small cube and immediately put it in a frying pan. You can add fresh cabbage, potatoes or, like mine, one sweet pepper to the filling. It will be delicious. You can even add boiled eggs - they wrote to me about this in the comments. I cut them into cubes and take care of the onions. As soon as it becomes soft and begins to brown, I fry the pepper and bring it to half-cooked. At this time, my cabbage had stood for 3 days and was already completely ready. It's warm in the kitchen, I drain the liquid from it. I want to try a recipe for sourdough using sauerkraut liquid , I saw it on the Internet. When the vegetables are already fried, add cabbage, a little salt, and ground black pepper. You can have more pepper - what can you do for the sake of your beloved husband? I add coriander if desired, and a small piece of bay leaf. I stir on maximum heat, trying to stir more often. I look at the cabbage: everything is fine, it's well fried and smells very tasty. Turn off the heat and let the cabbage cool a little. And now, friends, the simplest and fastest dough. Break two eggs into a bowl, add half a teaspoon of sugar and a little salt, shake everything well with a whisk. Add 400 g of sour cream (20% fat content) to the eggs and mix again. I add 150 g of sifted flour, 50 g of semolina and 10 g of baking powder and mix. I take a mold with a diameter of 20 cm and lined it with parchment. I visually divide the dough in half and place most of it on the bottom. I spread the cooled filling on top. I fill the pie with the remaining dough to the last drop. The oven has already warmed up. And the final touch is sesame seeds. Place the pie in an oven preheated to 200deg for 30-40 minutes. I'll get my bearings! With God! I'm waiting. I'll turn on the timer. Vera, what do you want?? You just ate) What do you want? To be petted. Anya, the pie is already squeaking! It stood in the oven for exactly 40 minutes. Anya, this is just a masterpiece. Look how beautiful Tadam is, look how handsome he is! Porous dough, soft and fragrant. I should have added more cabbage. You know, I still need a little sour cream to be completely happy. Yep, delicious! The dough just melts in your mouth. Yes, Anechka, you like it! Thank you. Will you at least let me try a piece? Of course, I'll give it a try, but first I wish everyone a peaceful sky, happiness, prosperity and, most importantly, love. Love each other, be happy! Yes, honey, here you go. Well, come on, mmm, the dough is absolutely gorgeous, as you said. Yes, housewives, try adding a little semolina to the dough - it will loosen it. Seryoga's is very tasty. In short, where is this piece of mine, and I will eat it. Look, he still holds his shape, great! And cabbage is just right for me. I won't show you. Do I have the first pie to show? Well, show me. This is the answer: today a girl wrote to me in such a very kind manner that something didn't work out for her, but I want to say - if you go to the kitchen without a good mood, then you will end up with a pie like this. It's the same recipe, the same thing. Look , there is a difference between the pies: bad news just came in the morning, and here is my reaction. The dough showed my state of mind. Well, it's okay, we'll eat it, it turned out just as tasty, only this way. The dough is also porous, can you see? Yes, it's obvious. Well, compare: this is also very tasty, it didn't affect the taste, only the appearance, because the inside comes out. How many times have I told you - everything in this world is energy. Yes, this one is also delicious, it's cold, Seryozha is even tastier. So maybe we can be patient? Yes already! As much as possible, I'm already hungry! That's it, bon appetit everyone, friends, we are without patience today, like that. Here is one recipe, one oven, did everything the same, only one turned out to be fluff. Sunny, in short, let's eat, come on! Mmm
