He's stealing our fire! But you will give us. Okay. Hello how are you, today we will do a challenge! The challenge of surviving in the wilderness! Shfa's team! Against Abdullah's team! The challenge of living an entire day with limited things. They will do rock, paper and scissors to see which tent they get. -Go ahead do it. - -Rock, paper, scissors. -I will choose the pink tent. It is all right, we will take the blue tent. This is our bag and we don't know what's inside, let's open it together. -Go ahead, get inside. -This bag will determine your day. This is our bag and we hope it will contain good things. We hope it contains good things. Go ahead, open it. -Water. -And firewood. We are lucky to get the firewood so we can light fire. -Okay okay. And tomato sauce. There's also corn. A plate. -Tea! -And rice, it's the most important thing. We got cucumber, onions, and Tomatoes. An apple. Imagine we didn't get any chicken, only rice. It looks like we're going to eat cucumber, onions and Tomatoes with rice. We didn't even get spoons. -Do you have a lighter? Thank God we got a lighter so we can light the firewood. I'm excited to see what's inside our bag. -Kebab! There's also milk! And water! God! -What else? -You got a pot? Yes so we can use it at night. We also got spoons. We got Tomatoes, onions, pepper and there's also lemon. -What else did you get? -Is that all? -Are you sure? Wait, wait, wait! What is this? There is no lighter. There's no lighter! That's the most important part! -How are you going to cook the kebab? I got an idea, we will borrow a lighter from the second team. All right, let's go. -Our beloved neighbors. We need a lighter. No, we are not going to give it to you. You have to give us something in return, if you need a lighter you have to give us something in its place. What do you want? -What should we get? -The pot! You give us the pot and we give you the lighter. -We will give you the pot. We are not going to give it to them. -We're going to cook on the grill. That's all right you can cook nothing, we are not going to give you the lighter. You are stingy, come on let's go. What were we supposed to do? How can we give them and they don't give us anything. Yes. Let's make some tea. -My sister will light the fire because it's dangerous. Look the fire is on, after a hard time. Imagine we don't have any firewood, charcoal, or even a lighter. -Let's go search for firewood. -There is a firewood in the desert. It's a blessing, a blessing. -Look at what we got. Let's place the firewood in the grill. We are good. -We mastered the nature. Look at how they gather firewood. I have an idea and it could light the fire. It doesn't work, that's only works in cartoons. I have an idea to light the fire, you will see how it's going to work just stay put. He is stealing our fire! You are cheaters, give us the pot. We're not going to give it to you, we used our brains to get this fire. You are a cheating team and you will lose. -We're going to make tea. We add the tea. Our water is almost out add just a little bit. It's going to be a great firewood tea. -We got fire! I will show you, I will teach you how it's done. Tea is ready. The best tea made by us. It's delicious. We are going to grill the kebab, let's go. Today we're going to have the best kebab. God! Kabab! Get away from here you're losing team! Get away from here! -What did you get? But we have tea. -Are you going to give me some? -I will show you how my kebab is done. What are we going to eat? We Are hungry! Let's search in the bag. -We're going to eat the apple. I'm trying to cut it with my hand. We found the spoon. We are healthy people, we eat apples. You can have your own apple, our kebab is more delicious. Look at how it is cooked, God! -We need to find a pot to cook. -Let's go try again with them. -Our beloved neighbors. Please, could you lend us the parts, you don't need it. We do need it, get away from here. I have a proposal for you, you give us the pot and then we will give you part of our rice. After it is cooked. Give us a minute to talk about it. Let me tell you something, we don't have neither rice nor bread. -Okay, we will give them. We're going to make some rice! -But you will give us. Yes! We finally have a pot to cook our rice. We're going to put water to wash the pot. -The life in wilderness is hard but sweet. We add the rice. We don't have water, how are we going to make the rice? It's just our bad luck, we don't have enough of anything. That's right. Let's go lend from the other team. Hello our neighbors, sorry for disturbing you, could you give us some water? You also don't have water! -You have to give us something in return. We have ketchup, corn, black pepper, cucumber, onions and Tomatoes. Give us a minute to talk about it. Abdullah, I love corn. -Do you want us to take on? -We want corn. -Let's give them one piece. Okay. Here is the corn. What is this? Only one piece! -It will be enough for you. -Okay, what do you want? Okay, we will give you a ketchup. -Here you go. -Here's the water. -We finally got some water from them. Let's put the parts on the charcoal. We put spices with the rice. -Is it black pepper? We put ghee. We will put kebsa us spices because we don't have any meat. -Just to give the flavor. I believe this rice will be delicious. Thank God we found salt or else our rice would be without any salt. It is dark and we haven't eaten yet. Look it is all dark outside and the challenge is not over yet. We also made the corn we put it underneath. We also grilled the pepper and Tomatoes. Look at them. Honestly, your food looks very delicious. What? Is the rice not ready yet? Today's challenge is weird, it looks like we're not going to eat anything tonight. Let's go watch them. Honestly, your kebab looks very delicious. Go over there, stop watching us. Just get out of here, stop watching us. It's our fault that we came here. We're going to walk in the desert while our rice is being cooked. Let's go. Imagine we're going to encounter some insects. It's all right. What do you think is inside this hole? I hope there aren't any snakes. -I feel that snakes are in there. Just keep walking. -Let's climb the mountain! I won! We are hungry that's why we're going to eat the cucumber. Okay. It's good that you have cucumber. Thank God things are getting better now. -That's right, is your rice being cooked? -That means that? That's right. -Do you want to see our rice? Come with us. It's only needs a little more cooking. Imagine they made this rice, I swear. You did a great job! I know how to make rice because I used to watch Abdullah do it. -We pour the rice. We're going to give the second team some rice. -Because you had to deal with them? Alright, three, two, one go on turn it Shfa! Look at the rice! We prepared rice for them because we promised them. -Abdullah and Ghazel, come here! Here you go your rice. -Thank you. We have a lot of kebab, what do you say we give them some? Okay. -We agreed to give you some kebab. You are welcome. Yummy, we're going to eat kebab. In the name of Allah. Now I will taste the rice. Let me try it. In the name of Allah. Shfa, your cooking is very delicious. Thank you. It's great. -You're cooking is also very delicious. You are welcome. I'm going to taste our kebab that we made. Is it good? Let me taste our rice. The best part of today was working together. -And we also learned how to share. Honestly, Shfa your rice is very good. My sweetheart Ghazel, that's nice of you. We're going to play XO. -Who's going to win? Let's see, go ahead and start. Ghazel is X and Shfa is O. Let's go Shfa. She won! Mashallah! We're going to grill marshmallow. -The best part is grilling marshmallows. Look at what I will do. Look at how crunchy it is. With working together we can do anything. That's right. Bye! It's dark! Who turned off the led? It is a ghost? We entered the tent and it's very beautiful inside. That's right. It's cold, look. -It's very warm inside. Because you were working good together and you were good to each other here you go this gift. -Share it together. In the name of Allah.
