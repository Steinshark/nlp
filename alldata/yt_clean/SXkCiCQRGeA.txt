You are first among those I was a mother to you and you turned my son Forgive me. My Lady, you raised me. [scoffs] I think you protest too much. You cannot know what it is I know what it is to love yours. [shrieks] [gasps] You stay away from him. And stay out of my sight! [heavy breathing] We are ruined! [door closes] The queen has dismissed you and I will probably follow. If we can still get you married you'll be less of a threat. - What? Please, no. I cannot bear it.

It's good of the king To hurt you, Ophelia. You cannot imagine his anguish. - Where is my father? Where is he? Who murdered my father? I will have justice. An eye for an eye. An eye for an eye! Be calm. It is right and good to - But he did not die by my hand. Hamlet. Then Hamlet will die at my hand. No, Laertes. It was all a mistake. You must think of your - Take me to her. - Open the gate! There is much to tell you. Good thing you are You're already fat as a cow. You're lucky to find a husband no family and no virtue left. I hope you're not still for your lover, the prince. One candle would not be enough. Even if he ceased to be at all? If he dies then I die as well. You seem alive to me. Alive but married. To Hamlet? Then you are a widow. Hamlet is dead already. My Rosencrantz and Guildenstern They did not like their orders, What did the king I will not tell! [both grunt] Tell me. [both grunt] - Oh! Ah! Ah! Ah!
