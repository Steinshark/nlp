[ORGANISER introduction in Spanish] Andreas Antonopoulos! [Applause] [ANDREAS] First of all, allow me to thank you all I would also like to thank Jorge Farias and and inviting me, as it has been a great pleasure Last year, I published [my book] 'The Internet of Money' Jorge was very kind to sell some copies here. Let me say in advance: if you want me to sign your book, I will [stay] until about 4:00 p.m. I would like to All right. [You might wonder], The biggest focus for me over the past two years The unfortunate truth is, a lot of the information is in English. That represents an enormous barrier for Language is one of the greatest difficulties Technical literacy, access to smartphones available to a lot of people But speaking fluent English and understanding One of the most important things in my journey has available in as many languages as possible. I have the great fortune of many supporters... who volunteer their time to translate The good news: of the 300 or so videos have subtitles in Spanish, a larger [portion] That is all thanks to the work of volunteers. That will continue with my next book, Most importantly, these books are which means people can download [them] and use it to build courses, tutorials, and workshops. Education is the [primary] effort in our space today. In order for us to [realize] the potential of this technology to billions of people around the world, we need [We need] to focus on the education, not the speculation, [We need to encourage] cryptocurrency as a way We need to make it accessible to as many [breaking down] language [barriers]. Which is why I'm sorry that I would love to and I am trying to Some of us have far more skill than I watched with great humility as within 18 months, he delivered a presentation Well, we can't all be Vitalik. [Laughter] I'm here today because I believe Panama for the development of cryptocurrency Both because of the multi-cultural and multi-national But also because it is a country that has traditionally and It offers access to financial services [for many people] South America is where Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, You don't need it in Los Angeles, Chicago, or New York. [Most people] can use their Visa card, In fact, [many of] the people who don't are Spanish-speaking immigrants who don't [even] They need [bitcoin]. People in South America economic difficulty, and currency crises, which keep Of course, all of those things [stem from Today, Western democracies are cool. They are liberal, at the end of a bayonet. Not for the most part... It is wrapped in a nice little package we just call Globalization, as it is understood and practiced, Only now it is not delivered with [explicit] force, It is delivered with [subtle] coercion, where they you will be cut off from the U.S. dollar, from the SWIFT Globalization is [currently] not something it is something multinational companies and powerful to arbitrage [between] jurisdictions, to shop around for where they can deliver financial Globalization has a negative To the average person, it [comes in the form of] Cryptocurrencies change the nature of centralized and only available to the most powerful, [into something accessible] Not all of us. For the time being, just a few the education, the access, and capital to participate. But every day, more and more people can use of globalization, one that allows and arbitrage between currencies, Until now, the only way individuals could take Someone would leave their country, take their where they are not welcomed, but treated as The only reason why someone would do that is But what if you could leave your currency What if you could become an international participant What if you could become a multi-national corporation But part of the reason governments, in many cases, the power it gives to individuals, [the power] When governments say, &quot;If everyone has You should ask them, &quot;What about all of the multi- &quot;You didn't seem so concerned about them until now.&quot; &quot;If individuals can move their money, Rich people and multi-national corporations can already But other people were. You may have noticed, there That is because [one of the] world's Americans don't need to go to Panama for As long as they are rich enough to afford the lawyers to take advantage of globalization right at home. Cryptocurrencies are scary to many governments the same capabilities. This is one of the interesting effects of technology: it is the ability to acquire superpowers We don't [fully] appreciate the historical As I am speaking right now, a number of people Fifty years ago, the idea of an individual carrying in their pocket would be a superpower. You would have made a superhero movie around and make a video call was [something you The ability of an individual to wire money across as if they are some kind of New York stock broker, using a solar panel and a $20 Android phone. Make no mistake, that is a superpower. The person in the village who has They can fight for justice, like Superman or As Jorge said earlier, there are places in the world but they do have a smartphone or [feature phone]. As the prices of smartphones decline, those capabilities We are on the cusp of something very important. We hold a communications device, at the same time which [turns] every communications device not into When you have a smartphone with cryptocurrencies as Obama famously said. You are a Swiss banker! That superpower Who objects to that [change]? They don't see the need for this technology. &quot;Who needs Bitcoin?&quot; asks the person who has access to precious metals, no currency controls, Not you, sir. Clearly not you, yet. If you say nobody needs cryptocurrency, that is only When I first started traveling and talking one of the things that struck me was in Western developed countries, about The first time I went to Argentina, They asked me, &quot;How? How do we do this now?&quot; &quot;Thirty years ago, our government because they had a different political opinion.&quot; The &quot;why&quot; is obvious, the &quot;how&quot; is important. That geographical gap is critical to understanding When people say, &quot;We don't need cryptocurrencies,&quot; Who is the &quot;we&quot; that doesn't need access to But 2.5 billion people have no access to financial which just counts the working-age heads of household That [does not include] their families and children, who have 'de minimis' access to financial services, i.e. an expensive and controlled bank account in [massive] hurdles of corruption, bribery, and coercion. People who trade in a currency being That is not &quot;the banked.&quot; That is the underbanked. If you start counting that way, you realize financial services the way I and the privileged few in That leaves the other six billion who don't. In the early days of Bitcoin, But now we are beginning to learn that we can aspire We don't need to &quot;bank the unbanked.&quot; We need to controllers of our commerce and our financial future. [We need to remove these] anachronistic, which have persisted for centuries. With the geography gap, To people over a certain age, if you say, &quot;Magical internet they seem terrified by this idea. &quot;How does it have value?&quot; &quot;Who controls it?&quot; They understand, or at least think they generally But most people don't [understand]. For many [older] people, this technology is too strange. The idea that no one controls it, but you A system that is simultaneously anarchic A system of currency where I can tell you what to three decimals of precision. I can't tell you what the interest rate that will be decided by twelve people I didn't vote for. [The current system] has plenty We are replacing that with something that has no rulers, People say, &quot;Cryptocurrency isn't regulated!&quot; Cryptocurrency is regulated. It is regulated Bitcoin is regulated every ten minutes It is utterly predictable and deterministic. Forks, scaling debates, and things like that. But did the [average] block settlement time change? Did we issue more than 21 million coins? Nope. Did the people in charge change? Nope. There weren't For all of the screaming and shouting, nine years later... Every ten minutes [on average], [A similar process is] happening There has never been a financial network that seven days per week, 365 days per year, This has never happened before. There has never been a financial system through a simple personal device, [where they on the scale of a multi-national bank, as an individual. There has never been a technology like this. When people say, &quot;I'm scared. I don't know generally all that tells you is their age. I'm scared, too. As I get older, it is harder for me to I read incessantly just to keep up with people who The real generational gap is, every child born today will They will never live in a world before the internet, A person who grows up with [systems] like that They don't know that it could be any other way. If you tell a young person that money is an internet anywhere in the world, they will look at you In my days, money was printed on cotton and linseed [When we wanted to transact], we needed and hand them this germ-ridden The government had a complete monopoly on and told us that it had value. Then, one day, we [received] pieces of plastic only now it was even more controlled and &quot;You're crazy, Grandpa. There is no way that I can just imagine, twenty years from now, being given [an assignment where] they must They will struggle to understand why anyone would allow an entire nation's finances to be decided by a group of twelve people who are unelected, what the interest rate will be. It will be mind-blowing, like looking back and and taking a week to [travel] from if they don't die of cholera on the way there. Imagine a ten-year-old who is not allowed to have who cannot buy anything online with a credit card, who must beg their mom or dad to [refill the Or, as one little ingenious kid I watched and used her thumbprint on a phone to buy all of At that point, if you're the parent, you can't decide at the sheer ingenuity. But imagine that ten-year-old using cryptocurrencies, If you're a parent and you have kids at that age, They are and will do it. If you tell them not to, then they They will have access to private They will trade it with their friends and They will establish financial autonomy by once they figure out how to use this technology -- which they will learn about twenty times faster than you Then imagine the scenario where they walk into The banker tells them, &quot;You can access your accounts &quot;For the privilege of us holding your money, if you don't maintain sufficient balance, &quot;You will not be able to exchange it &quot;You can only buy things from merchants we approve of, some moralistic crusade against &quot;And don't you dare spend a dollar that you &quot;At random times, we may block your transactions because one of your transactions had &quot;Because we are terrified old people who don't That kid will walk out of the bank and think, 'That is 'Everything they do, I could do faster, cheaper, and more But that is not how [the future] will play out. The simple reason is, there won't The fundamental function of [a bank], of storing your It cannot exist [for long], because It is oppressive to those who can have it. [Eventually], they [and many others] will Will there be people who have bank accounts? Have you ever ridden a horse? A couple of people. It is just a hobby. Maybe it is your primary means of If Daddy buys you a pony today, you're a princess! A hundred years ago, if Daddy bought you a pony, you The bottom line is, these technologies They will simply make it the obscure, weird hobby of a few curmudgeon die- Every now and then, when I walk into a supermarket, someone at the front of the line pulls out a checkbook. [Everyone behind them] in the line sighs. [Laughter] Though, neither will your children. It will seem riding a horse, driving your own car, The greatest illusion that humanity is under We spend most of our lives assuming that everything We are shocked when we learn that people did That is the first half of our lives. If we are we enter a far more traumatic time, desperately while the world around us [seems to] go insane. Socrates wrote that the youth of his [time] had lost All they wanted to do was go to the theatre, the most as their parents had done. The generation after [Socrates] probably When I was young, certain movies were considered Even television is becoming an obsolete art form. The youth of our day are wasting their energy and and other things we can't understand. The world just changed radically. Anybody who tells you that these [open blockchains] doesn't understand human nature. When a technology delivers so much power to from [striving to] exercise that power. Satoshi Nakamoto is a modern-day Prometheus, Unlike Prometheus, [Satoshi] The gods were really pissed off at Prometheus. which is what would have happened to The smartest Satoshi did was disappear. Now that Bitcoin has happened, Make no mistake: every individual who learns to use for their entire community. No matter how much the [financial] gods [of today] Thank you. [Applause]
