Our job is small: to shoot the enemy and defeat them. [Bakhmut outskirts, Donetsk region, October, 2022] - Greetings, brother. - Where you going later? - Greetings. - I am just not have a spoon to taste a hot pilaf. - Come to see the car again? To see if it's alive, right? -Hey! - In case if anything, to fix something there? - Do you need jackets and balaklavas? - Listen, well, the pilaf must be there. - It's still hot. - Like a Glovo delivery. Well, we've seen everything, but there wasn't anything like this. - Or are you going to have lunch there? - Yeah, we can have a couple of pies. - The rest, there's canned goods, we'll take everything there. - What the fuck, canned food in the tank, Sasha? - I don't know. What's there. - Here, take this. - They've come from Pavlohrad [city in Dnipropetrovsk region] to visit their fellow countrymen. - Okay then, Glory to Ukraine. - Good luck to you guys. - Sweets, I left you all there. - Well, send my best to <<Wings of victory>> - Well, stay in touch, call me, tell me what is needed. [Like this video] - Here, your pizza. - The guys bring stuff all the time. Come on, help yourself. - I just had some apple pie. I don't want any. - Did you just eat his by chance? Cause this one with apples in it too. - You can have a bigger one, or a smaller one. - Ate that pie, felt like you was at home, right? Yevhen, tank commander: I've been fighting since the first days of the war. On the 24th of February I was taken and went to fight near Kharkiv. Nova Rogan, Barvinkove [settlements in Kharkiv region]. - Near Izium. - How do you feel here? - It would be easier to live on the sofa at home. - Yeah, it has its challenges. Heorhii, tank gunner: That it is easy, we cannot say. The war evens everything out. All of us are healthy, passed the [draft] commission, fit, then go work. Since 2017 without a break. - The man was already kicked out due to age, but he've still stayed. - How old are you? - Me and my guys have been used to each other since the first days of the war. This is our land, there's no way back. - Have you got call signs? - I've got a call sign in the crew. - <<Dundee>> - Well, I got at the exercises. There was a fighter, he came up with such a call sign, and it has been remained. - Okay. - And then it was changed to <<Crocodile>>. - Of course we read that our troops are breaking through and liberating settlements and cities. - What was that? - Theirs? Where is it flying to? - Op, here's the incoming. We're let to go home for 2-5 days there. This is ours, not they. But when you get used to the calm, then it is hard to adapt. And when 2-3 days, that's it, you adapt, you already know where the fire comes from, where the outcoming is, where the incoming is, you're ready for everything. - And you had such a thing that your tank was hunted? - Not here, so as not to jinx it. But on the Izium direction they were hunting. There we worked off 4 shells, we started right away to retreat, because we had burned their hardware and they became very angry. They were very angry with us and started to hunt us. For 7 days they were working on us, they were hitting us with everything they had. Except thay the submarine did not work on us, but the worst thing was the aviation. It was Maundy Thursday before Easter this year, that was... But apparently our relatives were probably there praying and holding candles. - And I was in Kamyshevakha. It was an incoming hit at night and we were under fire. It happened in outskirts of Bakhmut. Apparently, they had tracked down where our hardware was stored at night and tried to hit us at night. Once there was such a smell like burning metal, we climbed out of the tank and Grad MLRS was covering us with missiles. There was a whole bunch of shells in front of the tank, you know. - There was no brutsweeper on the right. - Of course we did not take photos, we had no time for this, but the fact is that we had stood there for 7 days and on Maundy Thursday we were changed. We got out and there was a bunch of shells from Grad MLRS in front of us. It was really hard. That's all right. Behind us are ours, everything is fine. - This is such a device. - You have to brew it. - Well, I'll make some coffee. - Sania, get me the <<3 in 1>>. - And the sugar? - Ira, would you some condensed milk? - Full? - Our crew has, how to say, a kind of crew slogan. - The amulet. - <<Abara>> My sister sent me this word <<Abara>>. It's some kind of ancient Slavic word, or, uh... Well, anyway, in a moment of danger, of threat, we say this word. - It gives strength, takes away. And it's a word we've grown accustomed to, and we say the word <<Abara>> all the time, as long as we've been working. And everyone in the crew then understands that there's going to be a fire. - There's times when a mechanic goes. He's like, whoosh, right away. That's so he doesn't relax. [Subscribe to the channel] - [to the walkie-talkie] How's the weather, how's the weather? Over. - [to the walkie-talkie] Plus, I got you. Over. - He's 61 years old now. He'll give handicamps to the younger, because he runs and works-out. - It's a great fear that you won't see how the children graduate chool, how they will go to university. To become a grandfather, well, this is basic stuff, everyone wants that. To be afraid for themselves, well, everyone does that, but the biggest fear is not to see the relatives, loved ones anymore. All the guys are tired, they want to go home, and they want peace. We have a battle here, but they [hit] civilian cities... Sometimes we're surfing the Internet, have seen, in Russia they declared a mogilizatsyia [pun combinated from Russian words <<grave>> and <<mobilization>>], as they call it, right? And now their mothers, when they take her two sons away, now she stands there and almost cries, <<Oh, there are mothers in Ukraine too, whose children are at war and have died, husbands, sons>> Now it must have finally dawned on them that there is such a thing. And what they were shouting until February 24th. - Yeah, <<Kill the khokhols [Russian ethnic slur for Ukrainians]>> Special fucking operation, they came to help, who asked them? We had every day here we lived, worked off, and wether defended the infantry - that's good. Successful, effective work was - that's great at all. It's very nice when a spotter tells us in the evening, <<Guys, the infantry is very grateful to you>> That's the best praise ever. I told you, we had a day when we shot 144 missiles in one day, imagine that. We had to load it all, shoot it all, there was such a huge mountain of pallets, it was freaking out. Well, the main thing is that it all is effective and successful. - It's early to be glad. - You guys are already Instagram stars. - Does your delivery ever stop? - <<Zucchini delivery>>. - <<Smereka>>, what are you, one plus? - Forties, as intended. - Armed Forces of Ukraine is cooler than Glovo delievery. - Yura, you wanted to upload... - Clear the way. - Dod you know that the Wagners [means the mercenaries of so-called Russian illegal private military company] fought against us? - Well, they talk that Wagner fights here. Oleksandr, driver and mechanic of tank: We took one of them, our 20th brigade, as we were in that brigade, then we took him. Dean man. - He was kinda junkie. - He didn't realize where he was going. - 20 years old. - Yeah, that's a lot of prison time. - He must have been a drug addict or a kinda hooked, his brothers left him and he was still lying in the trench. The reconnaissance patrol came and took him. - What is interesting, our side asked to exchange our dead body for this one. Nope. - Who needs him. Iryna Rybakova, press officer: So they tell us that they come at us, they get killed, and those behind them, they walk on the corpses. I mean, yeah, they're some kind of hooked. - Huh? - You can hear it from the sound, it's a different direction. - Yeah, well, still... - They're working on somewhere in the city. In the industrial zone somewhere over there. - Now I think there's gonna be work soon, right? Let's get to work. They don't let us smoke for a long time. [Become a sponsor of this channel] - How many times? - How many times. - To shoot? - As many times as they will say. - Where did our Saniok go? - Saniok went somewhere. - <<Abara!>> - <<Abara!>> - <<Abara!>> - <<Abara!>> - <<Abara!>> - <<Abara!>> - <<Abara!>> - A repeat is good. - <<Abara!>> - So, how do you think they did well? Have hit the target? - Well, if they ask us to repeat, it means that we're on right track. - 90 zucchini today. As they say, it's the best job, right? It's hard work. - It's only like that for the first ten years. - Take care of yourselves.
