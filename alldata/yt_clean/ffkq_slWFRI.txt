RAMIFICATIONS IN THE WEAKNESS SOCIETY. THERE COULD BE VERBAL AS WE HEAR ABOUT HOW SURROUND HIMSELF WITH, WE KNOW DOLLAR. WEAKER DOLLAR. JANE: THAT CAN BE CONFUSING. HE TALKED ABOUT A WEAKER DOLLAR. AMERICAN GOODS OVERSEAS. GOODS TRADE IMBALANCE. ABOUT TARIFFS BEING THE MOST MAYBE INSTEAD HE SEES TARIFFS WEAKER DOLLAR COULD.

UP NEXT, KEVIN GORDON, NEIL HERE IN NEW YORK CITY. &gt;&gt; WE ARE LOOKING AT CPI AND WE &gt;&gt; PEOPLE SHOULD INSPECT -- THEN LESS. &gt;&gt; THEIR UPSIDE RISKS TO INFLATION HAS NOT RETURNED TO &gt;&gt; THINGS HAVE BEEN BUMPIER EXPECTING. &gt;&gt; IT IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH AN INFLATION RATE PROVING MORE &gt;&gt; THIS IS BLOOMBERG FERRO, LISA ABRAMOWICZ AND LET US START WITH THE SCORES NEXT 30 MINUTES IN A FEW DAYS. NEGATIVE BY .2% AFTER SNAPPING YESTERDAY'S SESSION. A LITTLE BIT LIGHTER DOWN BY BOND YIELDS BACKING AWAY ON A DIGIT BASIS POINT MOVE IN THE THE TWO YEAR ANCHORED AROUND THIS GOING INTO THE CPI. U.S. RETAIL SALES. WOULD IT TAKE TO DISRUPT THE AND COULD THAT HAPPEN IN NEEL KASHKARI SAID THAT IT INFLATION FRONT AND THAT COULD IT IS REMARKABLE HOW QUICKLY IT BEING THE TOP CONCERN BACK TO THE CPI CAN REALLY MOVE THE IT WAS NOT THAT LONG AGO WHERE TRADING ON WEEKLY CLAIMS ON THE THIS IS ONE PART, THE CONCERN INFLATION BASED OFF OF THE EARL DAVIS TALKING ABOUT AN TARIFFS. FOMC SAID ABOUT THE TRADE WARS. HAVE TO LOOK THROUGH THE THIS WILL BE A ONE-TIME HIT. DOES IT DEPEND ON HOW BIG THESE TARIFFS WILL BE. JONATHAN: EASING AND YET THE EQUITY BECAUSE THIS DATA IT HAS BEEN MENTIONED THEM DOWN BY 2.20. WE HAD BIG REVISIONS IN THE ODDITIES AND HURRICANES AND IT OFF AND THEY OVERLOOK THAT. MARKET SLIP AGAIN IF WE GET GOING TO SAY WE WENT TOO FAR ON ABOUT RECESSION? JONATHAN: FIVE OR EIGHT TIMES. GORDON -- KEVIN GORDON AND THEN REACTING TO INFLATION DATA. KASHKARI ON WHETHER THE DATA CUT. RALLY ON HOLD AS INVESTORS WAIT REPRICING. KEVIN GORDON SAYING THAT HAMSTRUNG AND MUCH OF THE IF DEFICITS WIRED IN OUTS, PUT PRESSURE AND IMINO -- AND GROWTH. FOR BAD REASONS AND NOT GOOD THINGS? KEVIN: BECAUSE THIS IS A GUESS OF WHAT THE THING THAT I STRUGGLE WITH AGGRESSIVE FED EASING CYCLES IF SINGLE MEETINGS, THE FED TENDS WHEN YOU OVERLAY ALL OF THE TARIFF WAR LABOR PERSPECTIVE RISKS. YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT RISKS TO IT IS NOT THAT THE HEADWINDS AUTOMATICALLY, IT IS THE FACT ABOUT THE FACT AND THE REALITY COULD BE IN A POSITION IN 2025 HEADWINDS AND THEN YOU HAVE AND FROM A LABOR STANDPOINT IN MORE RESTRICTIONS ON LABOR THE EMBERS FROM THE WAGE OF AN ISSUE. JONATHAN: UNCERTAINTY AND LOW CONVICTION PARALLEL. TRUMP PRESIDENCY, HOW USEFUL IS IN SOME WAYS IT IS USEFUL AND YOU CAN GO BACK TO THE A TOOL AND LOOKING AT EQUITY ON THE OTHER HAND THE ECONOMIC DIFFERENT. WHEN TRUMP TOOK OFFICE THE GO TO THE DOWNSIDE AND WE WERE YOU WERE IN A RELATIVELY YOU HAD 2017, THE BEST YEAR YOU WITH LOW VOLATILITY AND VOLATILITY DID NOT SHOW UP THERE IS A DIFFERENT SET UP IT IS A KNEE-JERK REACTION TO THAT THIS IS HOW THINGS CAN DIFFERENT SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES. LABOR IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE THE LABOR FORCE PERSPECTIVE BEEN FROM THE FOREIGN-BORN NOT THE NATIVE BORN. THAT OR TAKING A CHUNK OUT BUT PUTS PRESSURE ON THE LABOR PERSPECTIVE IN TERMS OF ASSOCIATED IT. DANI: WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THAT WILL AMOUNTS FOR ALL OF THE POLICIES. CAN YOU STAND IN FRONT -- IN WANT TO HOP ON. IT IS HAVING ITS BEST YEAR NOW WE HAVE NUDGED UP MORE. TREND WHEN YOU HAVE GOT CLOSE TRADING ABOVE THE 200 DAY THAT HAS IMPROVED ALONG THE 2000. WANT TO FIGHT THE TAPE. LOOKING AT THESE POLICY AROUND FOR 2025. HAS NOT SUGGESTED THAT THE STANDS RIGHT NOW IF ALL OF IT BE STAGFLATIONARY. COMES FIRST BEFORE YOU TALK EARLIER YOU TALKED ABOUT AND TARIFF POLICY FROM A THINKING ABOUT CONGRESS. UNILATERAL COMES FIRST AND YOU LATER DOWN THE ROAD AND THAT IS DISCUSSING A SLIMMER MARGIN IN WHICH IS WHY IT IS SHOCKING TAX CUTS LIKE DO WE ACTUALLY TWO SEAT MAJORITY. KEVIN: PRICING THINGS AND, I HAVE FIND MARKET IS PRICING IN THE NEXT JUST BECAUSE THE OVERWHELMING DRAWN OUT PROCESS AND WE WOULD THE FACT THAT YOU GOT A DOES IT AS A CLEARING EVENT AND TOOK I DO NOT THINK WE SHOULD BE PAST WEEK AND THINKING THAT IS WHAT IS GOING TO BE THE DOMINANT PARTS OF LEADERSHIP. YOU GO BACK TO 2016 FROM DAY, THE PARTS OF THE MARKET ARE SIMILAR TO WHAT HAS BEEN IN THE ULTIMATE IRONY, IF YOU THEIR PERFORMANCE WAS, THEY LAG FROM 2016 TO INAUGURATION SO NOT TO SAY WE GET A PERFECT YOU HAVE TO TAKE A STEP BACK AS UP IN THE ELECTION NARRATIVE. DOES THAT MEAN THIS IS A GREAT WHERE WOULD THAT BE? KEVIN: HAD SEEN SOME OPPORTUNITIES DONE WELL NOT JUST YEAR TO DATE AND IT WAS MORE IN THE TECH AND MADE SENSE TO DO SO, ESPECIALLY HIGHER VALUATION AND VALUATION THOSE WERE A LOT OF THE IT MADE SENSE TO START ADDING HAD NOT DONE AS WELL. ASSOCIATED WITH THE AGGRESSIVE CYCLICAL STARTED TO RALLY. WELL BEFORE. MASSIVE LEADER SHIFT -- WILL DO WELL IN THE NEXT ELECTION CHANGED IT. JONATHAN: GOLDMAN IS UP 55% AND MORGAN PICK A BANK, THEY HAVE RIPPED WHAT DO I DO WITH THOSE NAMES? FOR BANKS IN PARTICULAR, THAT CAREFUL ABOUT DRAWING BECAUSE AND AGAIN, I JUST DO TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND BE THE BECAUSE THE DYNAMIC AND BANKS WAS THE SIXTH WORST IT IS NOT AS IF YOU CAN SAY IT AND TIED THAT TO WHAT SECTOR I WOULD PAY ATTENTION TO THE THINGS LOOK RELATIVELY STRONG. MATERIAL HITS FROM TARIFF OR LITTLE BIT. ANNMARIE: WHEN IT COMES TO THE BANKS THE REGULATORS AT PLAY. THINK WE WOULD SEE THIS MOVE? I DO -- I THINK THAT REGARDLESS THAT IF IT WAS AS DECISIVE, WENT THE OTHER WAY YOU WOULD NOT AS STRONG IN THE BOND INTERESTING MOVE WITH THE RISE YOU TYPICALLY DO NOT SEE THAT MUCH. JONATHAN: ONE IS WRONG AND WE HAVE TO HARRIS WIN A SWEEP AND A BIG THINK THAT APOLLO IS UP AND ANNMARIE: REGULATION NOT THE IDEA THAT WILL BE THE M&amp;A ACTIVITY. WAITING ON THE SIDELINES. I THINK KEVIN IS RIGHT, THE BASE CASE WAS THAT IT WOULD DANI: IT IS QUITE REMARKABLE TO VOLATILITY INDEX. ASSET CLASS A STRAIGHT NOSE LIGHT TO SAY THAT IF YOU WANT MANAGER AND SCARED OF DANI: GOOD TO SEE YOU. STRAIGHT DOWN. KEVIN GORDON. CLOSE 2.2%. YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF. &gt;&gt; DONALD TRUMP IS RETURNING TO 11:00 EASTERN WITH SITTING THEY ARE SCHEDULED TO MEET THE TRANS--- OF THE PEACEFUL -- THAT TRUMP DID NOT OFFER TO TRUMBULL GO TO CAPITOL HILL AND AHEAD OF HIS MEETING WITH BIDEN. DOCKWORKERS AND EMPLOYEES ARE NEGOTIATING TABLE AND THREE-DAY PORT STRIKE. INCLUDING A PAY BUMP, UNRESOLVED INCLUDING THE ONE OF HAS BEEN AROUND AUTOMATION. BY JANUARY 15, A SECOND STRIKE THE FIRST CHALLENGES FACING THE SOFTBANK WILL BE THE FIRST TO NVIDIA BLACKWELL CHIPS. IT WILL SUPPORT LOCAL SERVICES AI GRID THAT RUNS ACROSS THE THIS WAS UNVEILED IN TOKYO THE GLOBE TO SUPPORT NATIONAL ITS RELIANCE ON A FEW LARGE U.S. THAT IS YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF. I AM CONVINCED NVIDIA HAS A THE STOCK STORAGES AND IT IS AND WE ARE LIKE WHAT JACKET IS DAN IVES CALLED HIM THE ROCK JONATHAN: A LOT OF PEOPLE. JONATHAN: BOTTOM OF THE HOUR. BLOOMBERG TV. JONATHAN: TIME IN EQUITIES GOING SHAFTER STABILITY IN THE BOND MARKET. CALLS. COUNTER PILLAR TO -- SAYING THAT DONALD TRUMP WILL THE SECOND CALL FROM WEBER AT UNCERTAINTY IN STARBUCKS WITH AND THE LOWERING THE PRICE TALKS UNDERWAY. BLOOMBERG ECONOMICS EXPECTED LAST AND HOT AT WORST. ANTICIPATING THE PRICE TO RISE HELENE AND MILTON. TO THE PROGRAM. DATA BECAUSE WE HAVE TONS TO WHAT ARE YOU IN THE TEAM I THINK THE CONSENSUS IS AROUND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I HAVE EBB AND FLOW. YOU HAVE TO HAVE A FUNDAMENTAL INFLATION. MUCH EMPHASIS ON ONE DATA POINT FUNDAMENTAL DRIVERS FOR WHY WHAT IS CLEAR IS THAT THE LABOR INFLATIONARY IMPULSE AT THE CONFIDENT ON THE TRAJECTORY OF SHAKEUP HERE AND THERE. -- THAT EMPLOYMENT COST INDEX AND YOU SHOULD EXPECT WAGE WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT INFLATION EXPECTATIONS AND SUPPLY CHAIN WE KNOW THAT INFLATION ANCHORED AND LABOR MARKETS ARE I THINK THAT PROBABLY PUTS US HURRICANES, WE HAVE A ONE-OFF WAGE GROWTH IS COOLING AND PEOPLE HAVE TO CUT BACK IN FOR THOSE AREAS DOWN. JONATHAN: INFLATION AND THE PROSPECT OF I IMAGINE PEOPLE WILL PILE INTO TARIFFS. FORCES THROUGH THE NEXT SEVERAL IT IS A WASH IN TERMS OF GDP. IMPORTS TO FRONT RUN TARIFFS SO THE IMPORTS WILL BE A DRAG BOOST WILL BE A BOOST. I DO NOT OR THE OTHER. DEMAND. DANI: IT IS REMARKABLE HOW QUICKLY OF A WEAKENING LABEL -- LABOR HOW BIG OF A RISK IS IT STILL? YOU LOOK AT THE SURVEY THAT SMALL FIRMS ARE COMPLAINING BIGGEST PROBLEM. SO, HISTORICALLY THAT IS THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE. OF THE LABOR MARKET STATISTICS, 4.1% IS THE OUTLIER MORE THAN THE QUIT AND HIGHER WEIGHT -- THESE ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE I DO NOT THINK WE ARE OUT OF THERE IS SOME WEAKER GDP GROWTH IT IS GOING TO BE VERY SUSTAIN THIS 3% REAL THE GROWTH HAS BEEN. BUSINESS COMMIT -- BUSINESS BOEING IS HAVING TROUBLE OVER YOU HAVE WEAKER CONSUMPTION AND MARKET IS FLAT ON ITS BACK. BE OPERATING AT A HIGH LEVEL ON BUT, UNDERNEATH THIS IS A WITH DOWNSIDE CYCLICAL MOMENTUM. SURVEYS BOTH FROM THE DIFFERENT AND BANK OF AMERICA HAVE BEEN THIS FROM THE INVESTOR SURVEY. ECONOMY WILL STAY ROBUST. WHEN DECEMBER, IT WAS ONLY 18%. NEIL: THE IDEA OF THE TRUMP DUST OVER THE FINANCIAL MARKETS. TO STEP BACK AND THINK ABOUT THE MAJORITIES IN CONGRESS THAT PARTICULARLY IN THE HOUSE ARE THERE IS NO PAUL BRIAN WAITING TO IMPLEMENT. ENTHUSIASM SOMEWHAT. AND I DO THINK THAT THE LAST THE FISCAL WELL ONE TOO MANY CHOICES THAT THE TRUMP TEAM HAS. BANG TAX CUTS AND FISCAL SPEND. BE CHALLENGED SOMEWHAT. MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THE BOND UNDERLYING DATA. IS UNDERVALUED. ANNMARIE: CALLING BAD THAT PEOPLE DO NOT WHAT WOULD YOU THINK OF SOMEONE MOVING OVER TO THE TREASURY THE PEOPLE VOTED FOR A HAWKISH AND SO THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE WILL THAT BE MARKET NEGATIVE? WE SAW THIS PLAY OUT IN THE THE FIRST YEAR HE WAS THE THE ITALIAN -- ENTIRE MOTIVE -- AND JOBS ACT. WAS A HAWKISH APPROACH TO CHINA BY TWEET. THERE WAS SOMETHING ANNOUNCED THING COMING OUT OF THE OFF ON THE NEWS. PEOPLE TO THINK ABOUT THE IF THE FIRST YEAR IS MORE ABOUT WHAT CAN THEY GET DONE MORE POSITIVE FOR MARKETS. TO TRADE THAT WILL BE NEGATIVE. GOOD THING FOR THE COMPANIES OF WHICH ARE GLOBAL AND WE KNOW MIGHT INVITE RETALIATORY ACTION ALWAYS GREAT TO CATCH UP WITH ON THE LATEST ON POLICY FOR THE SEQUENCING WE TALKED ABOUT, GUIDING LIGHT IS CABINET IF YOU GET IT IN TREASURY IT HAVE THE KIND OF EMPHASIS THAT A PUSH FOR TAX CUTS. ANNMARIE: BETWEEN A BESSETTE AND TARIFF CZAR, AND HAVE SOMEONE FOR WALL STREET. MEAN FOR U.S. COMPANIES. THIS LIKE LARRY BACK ON THE DAY. IT IS ON THE SHOULDERS THE UP NEXT ON THE PROGRAM, DAVID KELLY JOINING US AND THEN FROM NEW YORK YOUR DATA UP NEXT. JONATHAN: SECONDS AWAY. SOFTWARE. -5.2%. IN THE BOND MARKET RESETTING AND 10 YEAR. THE 10 YEAR 4.42 AND THE TWO GOOD MORNING. MIKE: THE CONSENSUS. .2%. 3 -- .3 WE WILL HAVE TO SEE YEAR-OVER-YEAR BASIS, TWO .6%. FORECAST FOR THE CPI COURT OVER ESSENTIALLY WE CAN SAY THAT FORECASTING THIS TIME. DIFFERENCE TO THE FED IS A IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE THE BETTER THAN EXPECTED. AFTER COMING INTO THE PRINT BY THE RUSSELL AND SMALL CAPS UP POINT. THE BOND YIELDS ARE LOWER THE 10 YEAR WE ARE DOWN ABOUT IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO UNDO THE 12 BUT IT IS SURPRISING TO SEE WE HAVE BEEN MOVING IN A THIS IS A MARKET THAT ONCE A I AM NOT SURE HOW LONG THIS HAS TO BE EVEN THOUGH CPI LOOKS IN 2025 WITH A DIFFERENT SET OF WHEN YOU LOOK THROUGH THE THERE GOOD REASON TO HAVE A MIKE: THE PRIOR MONTHS. IN THE FED IS LOOKING THROUGH BECAUSE IT HAS SLOWED DOWN SO AND WHAT THEY EXPECTED. OF .9% IN GASOLINE PRICES, AND RIGHT NOW CARS WERE FLAT BUT THERE IS A SEASONAL AND ASPECT EVERYONE'S CARS GETS WIPED OUT. WILL SEE PRICES GO UP FOR NEW IT LOOKS LIKE ACROSS THE BOARD WE ARE NOT SEEING MANY DECLINES. INFLATION HAS LEVELED OUT IF DOES -- DANI: DECEMBER IS STRAIGHTFORWARD NOW? THE REASON BEING WE HAVE THAT LABOR REPORT AT THE FIRST A LOT OF DATA BETWEEN NOW AND CASE THAT NO ONE NUMBER WILL BE A LOT OF DATA. JONATHAN: JOINING US NOW IS THE JP MORGAN GOOD MORNING. ON COURSE FOR A RATE CUT IN THE KEY THING IS THAT THE ASSUME, SPECULATE OR PREDICT FISCAL POLICY WILL BE. NOT PUT IT INTO THINKING. PICK A FIGHT. STAGE THAT THEY DO NOT WANT TO SO MARKETS ARE PRICING IN AT A QUARTER-POINT. STAGE HAVE ONLY PRICED IN TWO THEY ARE STOPPING SHORT OF THE THEY SAY THAT THE FED CUT SHORT THE MARKET IS SAYING GIVEN THIS THIS AGENDA THERE WILL BE TOO GROWTH TO MAKE THAT A RATIONAL THE FED DOES NOT SPECULATE AND THE DAYLIGHT. DAVID: STOCK AND THE BOND MARKET HAVE I THINK THAT THE ASSUMPTION IS STIMULUS. IT WILL HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE THINK THIS WILL BE A SLOW PILE TAX CUTS ON THROUGHOUT SO WHEN IT HITS IN 2026 IT IS A DEFICITS RISING. THING. WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE THING TARIFFS. DO WE FOLLOW THIS TARIFF AGENDA SIGNALS SAY THAT THE TRUMP ABOUT TARIFFS. DANI: IT AND SAID MAYBE IT IS NOT SELECTIVE. THAT AND YOUR CONCERNS ABOUT SOME OF THE PRICING? DAVID: YES. PORTFOLIOS. THEY ARE WAY OVERWEIGHT U.S. U.S. EQUITIES. THERE ARE TIMES TO THINK MOVING IS OVER TO POLICY UNCERTAINTY. I AGREE WITH YOU, THE FIRST TARIFF APPROACH WILL BE VERY THERE ARE PEOPLE IN AMERICAN INTERESTS IN NOT BEING TO YOU HAVE TRADE AGREEMENTS AND PRICE OF THE STUFF COMING IN YOUR SUPPLIERS. OF CONFLICT. ANNMARIE: IN TERMS OF UNCERTAINTY, LIGHTHIZER HAS BEEN NOT -- HAS MANY WOULD HAVE YOU AS WE HAD TARIFFS IN THE FIRST ADMINISTRATION CAPS ON ON. DO YOU VIEW THEM AS A ONE SHOT WHEN IT COMES TO THE IT PROBABLY CONTINUES, IF YOU WILL PUNCH YOU BACK. BE I CANNOT BELIEVE THEY PUT THAT IS WHY THEY CALL IT A YOU JUST DO NOT GET TO EXPECT NOTHING TO HAPPEN TO YOU. INFLATION BUT ALSO GROWTH. WORTH OF GOODS IN THIS COUNTRY. FOR COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD ON YOU -- ON US, WE WILL PUT A ISN'T THAT A BIGGER PROBLEM FOR BECAUSE WE ARE ON A TRADE BUT TARIFF ON TARIFF WILL MAKE THERE ARE VERY FEW THINGS THAT CAN PUSH INFLATION UP AND SLOW I SAY THIS AS AN ECONOMIST AND TRAINED OVER THE YEARS REALIZE PRACTICE TARIFFS TEND TO SLOW DOMESTIC COMPANIES INEFFICIENT THEY ALSO PUSH UP INFLATION ON BECAUSE LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS HOUSEHOLDS BUY MORE SERVICES. IT SOUNDS BEARISH BUT YOU SAID LOGICAL IN STOCKS. DAVID: FOR STOCKS. THE CORPORATE INCOME TAX WHICH IF YOU DO HAVE A REDUCTION FROM PRODUCTION, THAT COULD HAVE A ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS WILL BE LOT OF DEBATE AROUND THAT. WILL BE POSITIVE. DANI: LIBBY CANTRELL WROTE ABOUT HOW MARGIN WILL BE FOR THE NO ONE CAN TAKE A DAY OFF. TO BE CAREFUL WHO ELSE HE PULLS ADMINISTRATION. THEY WILL GET THAT 15% TAX CUT? QUITE POSSIBLY BECAUSE YOU HAVE NOT A POLITICAL OBSERVER BUT IT DISPARAGEMENT BUT THIS IS WHAT ANNMARIE: DAVID: AND IT LOOKS TO ME RIGHT NOW WOULD BE 222-213. ENOUGH TO GET IT THROUGH. A LOT TO LOOK FORWARD TO. DAVID KELLY OF DAVE -- OF J.P. INFLATION DATA IN LINE WITH STRIPPING OUT FOOD AND ENERGY THE MEDIAN ESTIMATE WAS 0.3. .2% ON THE NASDAQ 100 UP BY THE OUTPERFORMANCE UP BY .8%. A TWO YEAR AND 30 YEAR, THE YEAR UP BY 10 BASIS POINTS. BASIS POINTS. WHERE THE EURO IS. MORE POSITIVE. RESPONDING TO THE DATA IS THE PRATT -- NEEL KASHKARI. RAY TO CATCH UP. AUDIENCE WHO MIGHT HAVE MISSED IT WOULD HAVE TO BE A SURPRISE THE OUTLOOK SO DRAMATICALLY IF BETWEEN NOW AND THAT. LABOR MARKET HEATS UP BETWEEN NOT THAT MUCH TIME. AGO AND ANYTHING IN THAT TO FIRST OF ALL, IT IS FRESH DATA GO THROUGH IT IN A LOT OF IT SEEMS TO BE CONFIRMING THE WE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS SO I NEED TO GO THROUGH THAT NOT DONE. WHERE WE WANT IT TO BE. TIED TO RATE -- TO WAGES IS HOUSING INFLATION IS A LAGGING A COUPLE OF YEARS FOR NEW ARE HEADING IN THE RIGHT RIGHT NOW I THINK THAT RIGHT DIRECTION AND I HAVE WE NEED TO WAIT AND WE HAVE DATA TO ANALYZE. MIKE: NOTABLE IS A CHANGE IN VIEWS END UP. NOW THEY ONLY PRICE AND 75 AND 2025. BECAUSE WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT THE PLOT AND THE SUMMARY OF THE TABLE AND YOU CANNOT PUT A AND MAYBE YOU ARE IN THE SLOW DOWN EVERYTHING AND PEOPLE GUIDANCE FROM THE FED? NEEL: THE DOT PLOT IS SOMETHING THAT AND AT TIMES IT IS MORE OF A BECAUSE THERE IS SO MUCH OVER THE PAST YEAR OR TWO I RESILIENCE OF THE U.S. POLICY RATES. AND YET THE LABOR MARKET STAYED CONTINUES TO SURPRISE US. IS THE NEUTRAL RATE FOR THE NOT ABOUT THE ELECTION BUT HOW FOR EXAMPLE, THERE BEEN PRODUCTIVITY IS HIGHER THAN IT IF THAT HIGHER PRODUCTIVITY WOULD TELL ME WE ARE IN A THAT IS NOT ABOUT THE ELECTION PERFORMING. TO MY OWN UNCERTAINTY ABOUT DESTINATION. ABOUT WHAT IS THE NEW GOING TO DO. ABOUT WHAT IS THE GROWTH TOM SAID YESTERDAY, YOUR THAT RIGHT NOW THERE IS NO WAY KIND OF ASSUME THAT THINGS ARE INFLATION STUCK ABOVE 2%. SENTIMENT? NEEL: I AM NOT SURE THAT INFLATION IS IT IS RUNNING IN THE MID 2'S ON GOODS INFLATION IS BACK DOWN TO WAGES AND WAGES ARE GENTLY HOUSING INFLATION WILL TAKE A LEASES ROLL ALL THE WAY THROUGH I HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT IT IS INSTEAD HEADED THERE FAST THAT AND THE LABOR MARKET WILL DANI: SEPTEMBER YOU SAID THAT THE A WEAKENING LABOR MARKET? NEEL: WHICH WAS PRETTY MUCH POINTED SOFTENING LABOR MARKET. WAY WITH THE LABOR MARKET REVERSAL IN THE JOB REPORT. IS SOFTENING. GOOD AND A GOOD LABOR MARKET. TWO YEARS AGO. BEEN SOFTENING. PLACE AND WE WANT TO KEEP IT BUSINESSES LARGE AND SMALL AS GENERALLY WHAT I HEAR IS PEOPLE FEEL GOOD ABOUT THE ARE SLOWLY SOFTENING AND WE JONATHAN: ELECTION. MONETARY POLICYMAKERS WORLDWIDE. WE DO NOT SPECULATE AND WE YOU ARE IN THE RISK MANAGEMENT LONG TIME, IT PREDATES YOUR RESERVE. IN 2025 AND WHEN YOU THINK FOR A SLOW APPROACH FOR ANY I THINK WE HAVE ALREADY HAD TWO WE HAVE A RISK OF THE LABOR RISK OF INFLATION GETTING STUCK. RISK YET, AND I'M NOT SEEING A INFLATION WILL TAKE OFF. IS LANDING AT 2.5 PERCENT AND THOSE EXISTED BEFORE THE BE UNCERTAINTY NOW. US AND GUIDE US. THE DISCUSSION A MOMENT AGO THERE IS TREMENDOUS UNCERTAINTY AND THE LONGER THE ECONOMY SIGNAL I TAKE THAT WE MUST NOT ASSUMED. ANNMARIE: FED STAFF AMY A LOT -- ANALYZE EVERYONE COALESCED AROUND THE INCREASE. VICIOUS CYCLE OF ONGOING DID YOU AGREE AT THE TIME AND TARIFFS COULD DO? NEEL: I STILL AGREE WITH IT BUT YOUR IT DEPENDS ON WHAT THE OTHER IF IT IS A TIT-FOR-TAT AND ONE GO BACK AND FORTH INDEFINITELY, LONGER-TERM IMPRINT AND EXPECTATIONS. TARIFFS WILL BE LET ALONE WHAT WITH. MIKE: WALL STREET ANALYSTS THAT I HAD IT IS IF YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE A THEORY OF INFLATION AND WE HAVE A RELATIVELY STRONG CONCERN ABOUT INFLATION. REAL INTEREST RATES JUST KEEP OPPOSITION TO YOUR RATE CUTS. INFLATION AND HOW COME WE ARE NEEL: I HAVE DONE A LOT OF THE RUN-UP IN THE FIRST PLACE RUN-UP AND DISINFLATION THAT THE ONE THING THAT HAS BEEN THE LABOR MARKET ON THE RUN-UP . IT WAS MOSTLY SUPPLY FACTORS. IT TOOK A LOT LONGER TO RESOLVE. YOU PUT ALL OF THAT TOGETHER WERE APPLYING TWO FEET ON THE APPLYING ONE FLOOD. GOING TO SETTLE. GUIDE US. MIKE: CPI TO THE LABOR MARKET. EARLY DECEMBER. WE HAD A STRONG SEPTEMBER AND WHERE IS THE LABOR MARKET AS IN A GOOD PLACE. I LOOK AT THE DATA AND OFFICIAL UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE LABOR BECAUSE OF THE HURRICANES AND THE LARGE IMMIGRATION FLOWS BIG THEY ARE AND THEY ARE TIME SO WHAT IS THIS MONTH'S'S BRE I LOOK AT THE STATISTICS AND I MARRY IT TO WHAT WE HEAR. AND JOBS ARE AVAILABLE AND WE WANT TO KEEP IT THAT WAY. DO MY OWN ROUTE REACH -- MY OWN AND SMALL AND LABOR GROUPS TO MARKET IS COOLING SLOWLY, THOSE WILL BE IMPORTANT DELIBERATIONS. DANI: OPINION PIECE BASICALLY SAYING TRUMP ENACTS POLICY IN A WAY ENOUGH TIME TO RESPOND AND RESPOND. NEEL: FISCAL POLICY IS ALWAYS AN ANALYSIS AND ASSESSMENT. IT IS WHAT HAPPENS WITH OTHER THAT TYPE OF UNCERTAINTY, WE WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE LESS THAT WE LIVE IN. INFORMATION AS WE GET IT AND THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF CONCERN ABOUT JAY POWELL. FIRST ITERATION THAT MAYBE THEY OF THE FOMC IF HE WAS GOING TO THE ABSTRACT -- OF THE ACTUAL THWART ANYTHING COMING AT YOU INDEPENDENCE? NEEL: DUAL MANDATE GOALS. MY COLLEAGUES, STABLE PRICES NUMBER TWO, THOSE GOALS ARE NOT I THINK EVERYBODY ACROSS THE INFLATION BACK DOWN TO 2% AND MARKET. SUPPORT AND THEN THERE IS CONGRESS DESIGN. THE PRESIDENTS ARE INDEPENDENT BETWEEN THE PEOPLE WHO ARE MANDATE GOALS AND THE CONFIDENT THAT WE WILL DO THE ECONOMY. MIKE: THE HOUSING MARKET, HOW DO YOU FACT THAT PRICES ARE NOT COMING AND IF YOU KEEP RATES HIGHER ALREADY SEEN MORTGAGE RATES CUTTING. NEEL: STUDIED IT, THE LACK OF INCOME WORKERS BUT MIDDLE-CLASS ONE THAT WE HAVE UNDER BUILT WE JUST STRUCTURALLY UNDER I THINK ABOUT THE NOTION OF A ABOUT A NEUTRAL MORGAN -- IF THERE IS A LOT DEMAND FOR WILL CLEAR THAT MARKET? THINK A HIGHER INTEREST RATE I THINK THE HOUSING MARKET HAS DRIVING THIS MORE THAN MORE THAN MONETARY POLICY. MIKE: SAYS IT IS SOMETHING WE CANNOT IF WE SAID WE WOULD CUT HOUSING AFFORDABILITY, SETTING WHAT WOULD THAT PROBABLY DO? WOULD IMPROVE AFFORDABILITY. IS WELL-SUITED TO ADDRESS THE JONATHAN: MARKETS. YOU KNOW THEM WELL. INTO AN ASSET BUBBLE? NEEL: I ALWAYS GO BACK TO WHEN DECLARED RATIONAL EXUBERANCE IN FOUR YEARS. FED HAD TRIED TO USE MONETARY WOULD HAVE DONE MORE HARM TO RECESSION THAT FOLLOWED.
