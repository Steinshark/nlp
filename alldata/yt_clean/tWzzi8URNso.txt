This thing's only twenty dollars, so it's more expensive I'm a little sus of this. This is like something that would be in, a woodworker's garage. There's no way it works as well Let's try. All right. Pizza's back. We're gonna do both of them. Put your chair out, bro. So we just have a hot pizza. Hot pizza. Hot. What would you do with a hot pizza? Pretend like this table is the oven.

Do you use a pizza peel No. No. The hard part for me is always the trying to shove into the oven. And I think this little guy would be helpful with that. Okay. Well, I was under the. When I saw it on, maybe it was an optical illusion. I thought what they were doing, is if there was just a pizza and then it went like this, Like. I agree with you. Obviously, but so can that.

I think we. I wonder. Taking this thing everywhere. I feel like we need to, completely clean it off and see To do what? I don't know. I feel like it was doing and then it got a little streaky. Are there refills for Because it really is. Well, simply rinse our pizza pill with a cloth for easy cleaning. The handle is equipped with facilitating convenient hanging, and saving storage space. All right, now that I understand I am pretty dang convinced. I, and. I was really going hard with it. That's why it's got the stretch marks now. But stretch marks are part of life, Right. It's something to be embraced. So we are saying, new tool. The old school way to make whipped cream just involves heavy whipping cream, a whisk, and a sweaty guy. I'll be the sweaty guy. And I will be the unsweaty, high tech future cream man with Of course. Not a sponsor. We paid seventy bucks for this thing, and it's. Now, because we're gonna race. Yeah. Now you've already. I only just, that's all. You've already kinda started. This thing is super heavy duty. I mean, and it comes with nitrous tablets. That's not a tablet. What would you call that? I call it a cartridge. It's like, a cartridge. Put that in there. Well, I'll do what I was told to do, which is. Okay, I'm starting. No, don't. Okay, there's a fill line here, Is this how you whisk? The fill line's on the outside. In circles? In circles? Is that how you do it? In the. Side to side? But not the end. Figure eight? So how do I know? I can't do a figure eight. How do I know when I've through the thing? It's really hard to tell. I haven't. It's less than the fill line. Nicole, do I, like, put one hand on? I'm taking my time because I'm long as this thing works as advertised to me by Davin. Oh, I can't do it with my left hand. I got nothing on my left hand. It's like a baby's hand. We'll be good to go.

I'm not gonna clock wipe. I'm gonna put. I couldn't even do it if I wanted to. There we go. Oh, that's. I just heard it. I heard it fill up with pressure. And now I'm gonna take this thing. Oh, we got some cartridges. Oh, it feels cold all of a sudden, too. Yes. Thermodynamics. One, two, three, four, five. At least five shots. I just went for ten. And now.
