I am gonna tell you a story. <i>It's a story I thought I knew.</i> <i>Turns out...</i> <i>it's far more incredible...</i> than I ever imagined. <i>It begins in one of the most <i>There's something in these mountains</i> <i>that I have a special connection to,</i> <i>and so do you.</i> I'm talking about gold. <i>There's nothing else like it.</i> <i>A miracle of nature.</i> Oh, my God, that is heavy. <i>Since the first civilisations,</i> <i>it's been a part of us...</i> <i>helping to build our modern world...</i> People were making fortunes. <i>...transforming entire communities...</i> <i>...and even the way they're powered.</i> <i>I'm on a journey to discover This is the true meaning of the beginning of jewellery <i>...what we're prepared to do to get it...</i> So we're going down? So there you go. <i>...and why we need it.</i> That is a lot of gold. I want to discover how it shapes us and our world. So, Pascal, why are we out here The area where we're on is one of the highest that we have in Canada, <i>Locals call this <i>or Valley of Gold.</i> <i>And I'm on my way to one <i>LaRonde.</i> LaRonde is one of the deepest and the most challenging mine in Canada. And how deep does it go down? This one is 3.2 kilometres. It's one of the longest Look, I'm gonna tell you, so I'm a little nervous about going but I'm sort of really intrigued <i>Deep in the Canadian wilderness,</i> <i>LaRonde Mine is one serious operation.</i> <i>To see how they get the gold out,</i> <i>I'm going into <i>that lies far beneath.</i> It's smaller than I thought. I thought it was gonna be bigger. Actually, normally we fit -Twenty-five? -In here? <i>My guide is Pascal LaRouche.</i> <i>He's worked at LaRonde for over 17 years.</i> -So we're going down now. Yeah, so we're going down at the speed of 1,500 feet per minute. <i>That's almost 30 kilometres an hour.</i> A little stress you're feeling? No, it's just the idea into the... centre of the Earth. Sometimes it's hard to swallow. -It's hard to swallow. That's not a nice feeling. <i>We're on our way to the bottom <i>which is roughly as deep <i>stacked up on top of each other.</i> I've done some crazy stuff in my life, but I've never been three kilometres down into the Earth before. -So, level 278. Here we go. Thanks, Mark. <i>Out at last,</i> <i>but our journey deep into the Earth <i>To get to the gold,</i> <i>we have to grab a ride and go even deeper.</i> So we're going down. <i>Underground, the mine is connected</i> <i>by over 30 kilometres of roads,</i> <i>wide enough to handle huge, great trucks.</i> -It's getting warmer. I can actually feel the heat, you know? <i>After that bumpy ride, but it looks, well... a bit grey. Thankfully, we can do <i>Running through the rock is a seam,</i> <i>rich in zinc and copper</i> <i>with a bit of silver...</i> <i>and tiny amounts of gold.</i> <i>But there's only one way to get at it.</i> <i>Once the rock, known as ore, is blasted,</i> <i>it's cut down to size.</i> So how do they send it to the surface? There's a conveyor, All the way up? Yeah. <i>At the surface, the gold <i>through chemical extraction.</i> <i>It's then heated in a furnace Wow, look at how hot that is. Despite we're maybe 20 feet away, Yeah. I tell you what, it's so exciting. This is so exciting. It's the first time I can see it's... like you say, lava. Yeah. -Expensive lava. <i>It's hard to comprehend what I'm seeing.</i> <i>How did this come <i>It's mind-blowing.</i> <i>Once the gold has cooled, -Is that for me? Oh, my God. That is heavy. It's 21-kilo. -Oh, my God. -It's real. And this is worth, like, what, $1 million? Yeah, it's worth $1 million US. That is amazing. <i>Until I saw it with my own eyes,</i> <i>I never really gave much thought <i>how it's produced, and who benefits.</i> So, my wedding ring... To get this much gold, would've taken us several tons of rock. So the thing I'm left wondering is, what is it about gold <i>Some of the gold that the bride wears</i> <i>has been passed down <i>bringing both good luck <i>The moment that Nripin</i> <i>ties the </i>mangalsutra<i> <i>they're married.</i> <i>It's a moment we can And there it is, Nothing else would do, right? <i>There is no other metal like it.</i> <i>Its warmth,</i> <i>its feel,</i> <i>its unique yellow lustre.</i> <i>Cultures and faiths across the world</i> <i>have long revered it as sacred.</i> <i>Gold, it's pretty powerful stuff,</i> but there's another kind of power <i>In the heart of modern-day Ghana</i> <i>is the cradle of a great kingdom <i>Preparations are underway <i>a display of how gold is still very much</i> <i>at the heart of their culture.</i> So, this is Kumasi, Ghana, home of the Ashanti tribe. My parents, my mom is from Ghana and part of the Ga tribe, so there's a very special meaning for me being here in Ghana. There's also a very, and I want to find out more about it. <i>The Ashanti kingdom emerged <i>And, thanks to its vast reserves of gold,</i> <i>became one of West Africa's So today is the very special I've been honoured to be asked and it is an honour.

How long does it take So I wear this across my skin? -Yes. So this is the jewellery -Yes. So who gets to wear the most gold? So Otumfuo is the king? Amanhene? Okay, so nobody wears -Come...

Can I take a sword, or no swords? -They look good, though. <i>The Akwasidae Festival <i>and deeds of past rulers</i> <i>by bringing together <i>I've heard it was a big deal, <i>There must be thousands here, <i>Now we're all assembled,</i> <i>it's time for the main event.</i> <i>The arrival of the Asantehene,</i> <i>King Otumfuo Osei Tutu II.</i> <i>And his entrance leaves little doubt <i>The Ashanti have an old saying, <i>and they're not kidding.</i> <i>In fact, I've never seen <i>But this isn't some <i>Each item of gold is laden with meaning.</i> <i>These gold staffs carried <i>represent old Ashanti fables.</i> <i>Elaborate gold swords <i>and strength of the Ashanti nation,</i> <i>while the king's solid gold bracelets</i> <i>signify his personal authority.</i> <i>The Ashanti believe <i>and the festival is an opportunity</i> <i>for his chiefs to show their loyalty</i> <i>and give their thanks for his dedication</i> <i>to improving the region's prosperity.</i> <i>One by one, they come forward <i>It's only a brief moment, <i>And then... well, I'm called.</i> <i>Now look, I don't get <i>Well, this was kind of nerve-wracking.</i> Yes.

It's now known as San Francisco. It was very different back then. <i>So let's start at the beginning, <i>Hundreds of large ships arrive</i> <i>from across the Americas, <i>Most were abandoned as their crews leave <i>The ships left behind are buried,</i> <i>creating foundations for a new settlement,</i> <i>the central hub for gold prospectors.</i> <i>Houses, churches, stores, and factories</i> <i>spring up across the bay.</i> <i>But fires and earthquakes <i>So barely any physical signs <i>until a remarkable discovery.</i> <i>Off the Eastern Coast of the United States</i> <i>and a mile down on the seabed...</i> <i>explorers discovered a shipwreck.</i> <i>The</i>SS Central America,<i> <i>The ship was carrying more than And you have to convert which is some monster number maybe even into the billions. Nearly 600 gold ingots were recovered <i>and they are remarkable.</i> <i>The value of the gold but there's an incalculable, that is priceless, and that's history. <i>In a secret location,</i> <i>historian and geologist, Fred Holabird,</i> <i>has hundreds of precious artefacts <i>From gold to everyday items,</i> <i>giving us a new insight <i>to be living through the Gold Rush.</i> These are well-used work pants. Today, you kind of call them jeans. But the thing that stands out the most is this five-button pattern, which is so standard on the pants made by Levi Strauss Company, today known as Levi's. <i>This could be the oldest <i>dating back to the Gold Rush.</i> <i>The miners needed tough-wearing clothes,</i> <i>and Levi's sold in their thousands.</i> Mr Strauss became, what I consider, the most successful of all by far. <i>Mr Strauss made his wealth <i>without finding a single fleck of gold.</i> <i>A gold rush isn't just for the gold.</i> Imagine the lack of supplies. You're trying to get a shovel, <i>you know, we have every type People were making, often, fortunes. <i>Many of the passengers <i>through the boom of the Gold Rush.</i> The<i>SS Central America from the passengers. We've got a remarkable scene here, a specifically engraved gold watch case with a miner loaded <i>And with the help of gold</i> <i>pumping the equivalent <i>the economy of California boomed.</i> <i>And at the centre of it all</i> <i>was the rapidly growing <i>It's incredible to think that came about as a result at the bottom of a river. <i>The Gold Rush transformed California,</i> <i>they transformed America.</i> I think it's fair to say <i>It marked a new era.</i> <i>Prospectors travelled the globe.</i> <i>Now, gold mining became big business</i> <i>all over the world.</i> <i>And then, at the end of the 19th century,</i> the mother of all gold finds. It's lovely here, isn't it? It wasn't always like this, though. <i>Two billion years ago,</i> <i>the biggest known meteor strike <i>happened right here.</i> <i>The only visible remnants <i>are these hills.</i> <i>The impact shook the planet so violently</i> <i>that gold was pushed towards the surface.</i> This is where the story <i>Fast forward a couple of billion years</i> <i>and on a site nearby,</i> <i>prospectors struck gold.</i> <i>Back then, it was open farmland.</i> <i>Today, we call it Johannesburg.</i> <i>Mines sprang up all around.</i> <i>To turn a profit,</i> <i>the owners wanted a large <i>So new regulations came in <i>to leave their farms I remember as a kid, seeing images of miners from South Africa. You know, the strikes, apartheid, and I always wondered So now, today, <i>One of the first gold mining companies <i>where I'm meeting Frans Baleni.</i> <i>A miner during the apartheid years,</i> <i>Frans eventually became General Secretary</i> <i>of the National Union of Mine Workers.</i> So, Frans, is this the type of lift No, no, the one we used was much bigger. -Bigger. Fifty people in one... In one deck, so that's 150 people at a time. How deep did you go? I was going 3.6 kilometres It takes seconds to get underground. -Seconds? -It must have been warm. Sometimes it goes to 50 degrees Celsius. <i>To my relief, -Hi. -Hello. <i>Crown Mines is no longer active,</i> <i>but in its heyday, it employed thousands,</i> <i>including Nelson Mandela,</i> <i>who worked here as a security guard.</i> Mind your head, low-hanging wall. That's for me, not for you. So, Frans, what was Were you looked after? I mean, we're talking Yeah, the era of apartheid, We were almost like slaves, because what they needed What time did you start work? We used to start at 4:00 am. -And you worked five days a week? You work for 12 hours, on condition that you finish your job. If it happens for some delays you did not finish your job, -Really? And did you have breaks? No, no, no, no, there's no breaks, there's no lunch... underground, no, no. <i>There's no hiding from the fact</i> that gold mining played a major part in shaping South African society But with gold comes power. And those gold miners, they knew that. <i>In 1987, over 300,000 <i>over pay and conditions,</i> <i>bringing gold production <i>Frans was one of their leaders.</i> It shocked the industry 'cause it was the first time in an organised form can take And then after the 21-day strike, did you feel, did you sense a difference?

So deep mining for gold Nope. <i>Thirty years after the end of apartheid, <i>So, I wonder what mining is like now.</i> <i>South Deep Mine, <i>is one of the deepest in the world.</i> <i>But it's what's not underground</i> <i>that makes this mine so unusual.</i> <i>This might look like a regular dump truck,</i> <i>until you realise...</i> <i>there's no driver.</i> <i>You see, the really cool thing Hello, hi. <i>...is that unlike a traditional <i>much of its heavy machinery <i>Three kilometres up,</i> <i>on the surface.</i> Hello, I'm Idris. -I'm Matseleng. How long have you been a... -Are you a miner? But... this doesn't look like mining. This doesn't look like traditional mining. Have you ever been in traditional mining? Yes, I did. I was an operator before. I was driving that big dump trucks. -Really? So, now I move which means I have moved <i>These consoles look like something So talk me through This is a tele-remote, a rock breaker. This joystick is controlling the boom, and then it's also controlling the hammer. This is like playing computer games, -right? <i>South Deep's owners began the switch</i> <i>to automated mining back in 2018.</i> <i>Since then, they have mined more gold,</i> <i>more safely.</i> <i>And that's not all.</i> <i>There are Black South Africans <i>like the general manager <i>and a lot more women.</i> Mining industry was male-dominant. -Okay. There are ladies who are miners, and crew leaders, and then -That's great. So, do you prefer I prefer to be here. -Of course. <i>It's fascinating to see But there's something else <i>You see, a deep mine like this <i>Enough to power a small town.</i> <i>But South Africa relies <i>that keep breaking down.</i> <i>Bad for business,</i> <i>and bad for the environment.</i> <i>So, South Deep lobbied the government</i> <i>to allow them to build the country's first <i>It provides about a quarter <i>and it might even be <i>in the way South Africa uses renewables.</i> <i>But what do you do <i>Will it ever be possible to run</i> <i>a whole mine using just renewable energy?</i> <i>In the heart of Africa...</i> <i>is one of the continent's <i>Kibali.</i> <i>Every day, a workforce of over 6,000 <i>from above and below ground.</i> <i>So you're in the middle of the wilderness,</i> nothing for hundreds of miles, and you need to find power.
