- [Director] Morning! Yes, for you! - [Camera Operator] Hello, hi. - [Director] Here you go. - [Mike] Aw, even prettier! [laughter] - [Director] The other one we made ourselves this one we buy. - [Director] So how do you feel about your living funeral coming up? - A bit anxious, to be honest. Um... [discussing arrangements] - [Mike] Annie! - [Annie] Hello everybody! - [Mike] In an event when somebody dies people rush to call the funeral directors and do not really spend that intimate time with... the body that has just passed on. - [Friend] How are you? - [Mike] How are you? - Good! - Haven't seen you for such-- so many years! - Yeah, many years. Aiya, I need to hug you! Sorry, it just came back to me like, all the memories with you. Come closer. - Mm, sure. - Ugh, okay, pain. [laughter] True. - I'm so happy you're back, safe and sound. - Yeah! - I'm happy to see you too. - You're doing so well. I'm so happy for you. - Yeah. Thank you for inviting me as well. - I'm so happy to have you here. - Mm. - Yeah, very, very happy. Yeah, it hasn't been easy so I needed to have this with everybody. - Mm. - [Friend] This is because of, like, the... Is it a side-effect of the medicine? - And maybe cancer also. - Mm. Do you want anything to eat? - Uh, later. - Eh, Wei Shan, eat, please. Yeah, eh... Friends, friends, friends! Don't make me bark at you all. I really don't like that. Aiya, if not I'll need to start serving you all already. I'm descending from my throne! [laughter] ...with a majestic entrance. Now. Oh, can I serve you first? - [Friend] Wow, so good that I even get served? - [Annie] Eating well or not? - But, I try. - [in Hokkien] Slowly eat, slowly eat. - Slowly eat. - Eat slowly, eat slowly. - If I can eat, I eat. - Yes, if you can eat, then eat. Eat little by little, okay? - I know. - [in English] Don't worry. God is with us, yeah? - Amen. - Yes! - God is with us. - Hm? - God is with us. Emmanuel. - [Emcee] Welcome to Mike's living funeral. Okay, so a living funeral, right is an event where a person, still alive gathers loved ones to reflect on their life share memories and express feelings. It's a way for the person to celebrate his or her life while they can still participate. So she wants to share her food, her music and also, her time. Okay, so, without further ado let's welcome Rai. Let's get the music started. - Go, Rai! [cheers] - [Rai] Can everyone hear me? - No! - [Rai] It's going to get louder. [music starts playing] - [Rai] Alright, Mike, you ready? - Yes! Are you gonna take me home tonight - Take me home tonight! - Ah... - [Director] What made you have this concept of a living funeral? - So it's... I don't want to wait until I'm dead. I only wanted to see... my loved ones and my friends while I'm still alive. I don't know... how much more I can be a friend to them. You know? So I... I didn't want to wait around. I want death to be a bit more... um... close to heart? Something that is not so scary. It happens day to day. Yup, so living funeral. [chuckle] - Uh, is there anything anybody wants to say? Something in public? Like a eulogy or something? - [Hannah] I'll say? Hello. I'm Hannah. Uh, I come from the church group of people. Um, I think we're all very thankful that we get to... um... Sorry. I think I'm just very happy that, you know for all of us, I guess there are quite a number of memories that we've shared with Michelle. I think her parents have really raised... have really raised a very special woman. - [Myron] So I've known Mike for 22 years. [laughter] Yeah, so... Yeah, I... [laughter] I'm stating a fact! I think, having... Mike as my sister is the best thing that, yeah, has... ever happened to me. Yeah, so... I can't imagine not having a sister in my life, and... Yeah, I really... I can't imagine navigating this life by myself. Yeah, so that is actually a ritual that we always do whenever we're scared... - Scared. - We need confidence. - Yeah. - It's a double (hand) squeeze. - Mm. - [Yutai] I'm Michelle's, uh, boyfriend and, um... I have known her for the past six years. And... I don't think I'd be the person (I am) today if I hadn't met her. Yup. I really hope that I could have, like, more time with her to be able to, um, enjoy special moments with her. - [Director] Do you have any memories that... you sort of cling on to? - That I still cling on to? Running and cycling. My bike is still there! The black... all-black one. Yeah, it makes me feel very free with the wind blowing across my face. Early morning sun, 4 a.m., 5 a.m. then come back by 11 have coffee, have bread then you sleep the whole day. That's... that's how usually my Saturdays would look like. But things took a turn, when... I received the second diagnosis. I don't know how much time I have left and nobody here can give me an answer. So right now I'm very, very lost. Absolutely lost, because... I feel like I'm disabled, in some sense? [exhales] And that in turn makes me feel quite hopeless also. Um... Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go... - [Friend] Are you okay? In any pain? - [Mike] I think I may need a fentanyl shot. - [Friend] Okay, you sit first. - [Mike] I'll do it here. - [Friend] Do you want people to vacate? - [Mike] Uh, you all vacate the room first, can? Uh, men, vacate the room. Men, vacate the room. Uh, I need the room. - [Camera Operator] So, let's say you were healthy and you got to live to a very old age. What kind of life would you imagine yourself living? - No. - [Director] You can answer the question if you're comfortable with it. If not... - No need. - [Friend] You've actually, like, tahan (endured) for quite a few hours already. - [Mike] Since this morning... Last night, actually. - [Friend] Yeah. - [Mike] Since this morning... Last night, actually. - [Friend] Correct. - [Mike] I'm good. Mm. Okay, I can go out now. - [Friend] You can? - [Mike] Yeah. I can't... - [Friend] You can? Do you want to hold me? - [Mike] Yup. - [Friend] One, two, three. - [Mike] I don't feel resentment. I still don't. But I do feel a bit... sad that I'm not going to be on the same trajectory as everybody else. Mm. I... don't get to run. I don't get to cycle. I don't get to... have a... family with my fiance. I don't get to look after my parents or bring them for holidays. I don't get to have my children mingle with my younger brother's children. Things like that. Not resentment. It's just... too bad. I'm... I can't be there. Then you're left in the dust Unless I stuck by ya You're the sunflower I think your love would be too much Or you'll be left in the dust... - [Friend] What's one thing you still want to do? - I want to get well. I want to... I want to go back to Jesus. Or you'll be left in the dust Unless I stuck by ya You're the sunflower... In every victory, let it be said of me My source of strength, my source of hope... - [Mike] You know, I am grateful to hear every single laugh to see every single smile here. I think today went beyond my expectations. I didn't host this with any expectations at all. I just really wanted to see everyone, and... see everyone be happy. So, thank you for making me so happy today. It means a lot. Your presence is... so, so appreciated. It's not how long we walk together but it is how many memories we've made together that really matters. - Death is not... scary. It's the dying part that makes it... terrifying. It's... it's scary. It's not the same as death. Death is... final already. It's like darkness, right? In the absence of light, then there's darkness. Otherwise you won't know what light is. You need darkness to be there. And likewise, for life if there's no death, you don't know what life is. You need the clarity of death to help you see... clearly in life. - [Cameraman] Are you all ready? Come, all look here. One... - [Emcee] Okay? Okay. Okay, we're good! - [Cameraman] Thank you! - [Emcee] Thank you! Continue mingling, and we'll have Rai back to sing you some songs. - [Director] How do you pull through the dark days? - Maybe this? Yeah, I think this will help a little bit. Really. [laughter] I'm not kidding, it's really very pretty! What are these called? - [Director] I think they're freesias. - Freesias? I like them now. Thank you. - [Director] No worries. Someone still loves you - [Rai] Give it up for Mike, everybody! [cheers]
