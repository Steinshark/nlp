What is Bitcoin and why are we here today? I would like to start with the genesis story In October of 2008, a paper was published called That paper explained how this system [would] work. We now know that this is not a real name. Somebody out there on the internet came up The published the paper in October 2008. They had also written a prototype software program, they launched [the program and mined the genesis That was the beginning of the Bitcoin system. It was the beginning of the bitcoin currency. It was also the introduction of this new concept, which on the financial news channels: blockchain, This sounds like a weird story, right? Some person(s) [releases] some software [and] launches [a network; This thing starts running and embedded within the first This message was embedded in there for a reason. The message is a headline from that day, It says '03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on The headline [story] for the day Bitcoin was launched (like the head of the Treasury here) This may have been a coincidence. I don't think it was. Part of the motivation behind Bitcoin which has existed and [not] really evolved It is serving someone very well, just not us. [Though] when I say &quot;us,&quot; I am looking out on a bunch [with] the most privileged, [accessible], [You] have access to multiple foreign currencies, How many of you here don't have a bank account The average percentage in the United States is 18%. That means about 60 million people [Do you] want to guess who those people are? Poverty is one of the main reasons why people but also a lack of documentation. Maybe [they lack] documentation because they of course, illegal immigrants are one of But they [can lack] documentation for other reasons. [Many] perfectly legal residents don't have a driver's And 18% is the lowest percentage [Most countries have] more unbanked people; some countries having more than 80% of the population But if you talk to people in this country, you realise It doesn't. [It has] the same [type of] people who are to you, your parents, your brother, or your children -- then None of them went to jail, but more than a million At the same time, while they were doing foreclosures, They were [automatically] signing the foreclosure No one went to jail. They were packaging toxic securities as collateralized They were talking amongst themselves and saying, &quot;These are fraudulent, so don't buy any, No one went to jail. So who are they serving? Ironically, [many] people who work at banks, part of the They serve the weapon dealers. They serve money launderers, international drug cartels, If they don't serve us here, in this country, If you can't imagine, I can tell you. Much worse. Here we are, after twenty-five years of the internet. The ability to communicate information now exists for a large part of the human population. More people have access to the internet and Yet, in the last twenty-five years, banking If anything, we are backtracking. Over the past fifteen years, international finance used by powerful countries to attack [other] countries and other [mechanisms] of economic pressure. Banking isn't serving more people, More and more countries are finding themselves in they are under embargo or facing currency controls, [The citizens] face calamitous economic conditions; This happened to my family It has happened again and again It is currently happening in Venezuela, It is happening in Greece again; beginning to [happen] The [architecture of the] economic system The internet has not brought us a financial Modern banking is a deputized system and a militarized system of control internationally. Our banking is part of the domestic police system. Just like the banking in [many] other countries. Back in the early days of Bitcoin, An organization called WikiLeaks was publishing secrets Secrets about war crimes committed by U.S. forces. As a result, they wanted to shut down WikiLeaks. One of the ways they [tried] was to prohibit people The State Department first appealed to the court system from breaking the law. Of course, they didn't [get those convictions, Therefore they couldn't take them to court, Instead, they pressured Visa, MasterCard, to cut WikiLeaks off without any legal process. At the same time, you could use your Visa card to all kinds of atrocious political groups As this was happening, Bitcoin was just emerging. That little message said to me, and to many others, 'This is why we are doing this. [Without it], we are twenty-five years we are no closer to having a globally connected We are further [away] and the financial system is not With control over money comes corruption. We all know that. Power corrupts, There is no more absolute power You have freedom of expression? Great. But if I can control where you spend your money, You have the [ability] freedom to vote? [Great]. But if I can control who can send money to political Watch what is happening in Russia or Turkey. Starve [opposition parties] of funds [till there is] &quot;I win! Democracy!&quot; [Laughter] Bitcoin didn't appear in a vacuum, but how Bitcoin emerged suddenly in It was just the purview of weird geeks But after a while, people started noticing. You might be skeptical. 'Some person we don't know invented something and now my younger cousins think I should 'My aunt thinks it is a pyramid scheme If you think about [bitcoin] as an investment, This isn't an opportunity to get rich, isn't It is an opportunity to change how finance, money, If you don't think you need to think about the billions of people who have no access Then think about what happens if [they are all] [Think about] what that does to our world. [Yes], some bad people [will] be able to [Most of those] billions of people are good, That is how it works. On that simple My interest in Bitcoin stems from two sides: It is so cool, I get so excited by it that I can't Then I discover something else, [become] even more and [become] even more excited again. [Laughter] Some of you share that with me, Some of you know exactly what I'm talking about. That is a [great] reason to be interested in this the kind that can lead to a computer science degree, Something you could learn [about] as an accountant, It would be really useful and just like learning how to use databases On the other hand, I look at this technology Not the politics of parties, The politics [from] growing up in Greece and This is an experience I don't wish on anyone. It is an experience that is alien to [most] I hope it remains alien, but I'm not that sure it will. Money is this magical technology that, as long We don't concern ourselves with it and If we did, if we actually read about how money works, 'They just make it out of thin air, distribute it to banks, 'Then they charge us interest so they can get richer 'That is a pyramid scheme. The dollar works If we understood how modern central banking [But as long as] it is convenient, as long as it works Well, let me tell you something. In 2008, In 2008, our economy broke, the world-wide It has not been fixed in the mean time. Since then, [they have] issued almost all of which is money borrowed from your retirement That money [won't] be paid back. [Most people are] broke. [Laughter] JPMorgan Bank of American is bankrupt, The United States government is bankrupt. Japan is bankrupt, China is bankrupt. They are all bankrupt. They can play around with the shuffle shit around, pretend to bail out Greece, send money and then backdoor it [They can] find some patsies and make it appear At some point, there will be a reckoning. [Instead,] we destroyed [our] currency in order to That will come back and bite us. You don't [need] to think this [will] be important But one of the reasons bitcoin was created, one of It is independent. No one can control it. No one can When you see criticism of bitcoin by mainstream [Laughter] The question you should ask But you really don't want to hear that story; You [must] learn some history about Kissinger, Then some towers fell, some nasty things happened, Anyway, the dollar is backed by Bitcoin is backed by an international community of [Laughter] [Applause] Again, hopefully you never [need] [Hopefully you will] always have the freedom But you might be forced to choose between the and the geeks who brought you the internet. If you hear some of the people in the whole you might think the goal of all this is... to eradicate government money, as the first step and replacing all currencies with bitcoin. One coin to rule them all, world domination. I am not of that opinion. I think the idea of only one world currency [would be] We have grown up with a system where all currencies [Their value is] wrapped up with a bit of nationalism, In each country, it is a different flag By the way, if you go to other countries, when they wave their flag, they also chant, &quot;we're number one!&quot; [Laughter] It is [similar to] when you ask people, Then 80% of people say they are above-average drivers. We have become accustomed to a world therefore, they are part of this [geopolitical] battle, like The dollar &quot;wins&quot; if the ruble fails. In that environment, it is natural to think that currency where the only way that one currency wins A world in which you cut off your nose to spite your face, [as well as] the foreign policies of the We are currently engaged in currency wars, &quot;our&quot; currency -- representing &quot;our&quot; flag -- But if you stop and think about that for a second, That token is no longer representing value It is representing something else, some where you are trying to beat the other side. If that environment is what you know, if that is what you your natural inclination is to think, 'Oh, this one could But what if that is not how it plays out? What if, What if we understood that money is a way As languages there [may] never be one Every place has its traditions, its special needs. We have languages like those of the They don't need those in the Kalahari Desert. They will which they don't need Alaska. The bottom line is, languages [are They will keep proliferating. If you speak three or four languages, you Having variety [can] give you greater value. What if money works that way? What if we are going with a thousand, ten thousand, a hundred thousand You can choose [them] at any moment in time. When you hear that, you probably think, 'I don't want a thousand currencies.' 'I can barely keep track of how many euros are in a Well, the good news is that we are not We are talking about purely electronic money. The difficulty of trying to figure out which currency what the exchange rate is, and how to convert them, is something that disappears into [the background or whatever device [will be] holding your money. Then the fact that you have ten or You [may not] even know that What if we go into a world where fully connected, -- by anyone, anywhere -- and they don't even No currency &quot;wins.&quot; Instead, we all &quot;win&quot; by Until now, you use the currency of the country in If you are American, you have [some] choice to use other Just one, and you have to use that one to You still have to play the games of geopolitics. Your retirement, education fund, healthcare, income, that they are using as a weapon. Not that you wanted to be playing in What does [the end result of] that look like? Waking up in the morning and because you know they will and eggs could be 30% more That is what it looks like. [People are] experiencing that When you [consider] that bitcoin happened 'What [will] we do with this? Is it just about beating It is not. It is about having a choice. For most of the people in this country, for the rest of the world, that choice Most people live under horrible governments that do They also don't give them the freedom... to escape from whatever crazy trade Most people live in countries where it is impossible Although, to tell you the truth, the customer who [might have] changed my money in Argentina, where I tried to change it earlier. So maybe there is a way to tell the difference both are criminals, but some of them If you live in a country like that, and suddenly Not quite yet. It is difficult to use. Not many But one day soon, for many people and already You can say, &quot;You can go play your &quot;Do you want to try and play Russia against America If you know what I'm talking about, great! While you make the lira trash, I [will] take No one can stop me, because this is an internet If you live in Venezuela and your you can say, &quot;I [will] take my or have someone send me bitcoin from another country, &quot;I [will] be called a terrorist by my own government, We know of people who actually bought food and smuggled into Venezuela, [paid with] bitcoin. Food! This technology gives people choice. We already have more than a thousand that same basic technology to do different things. [This is] a very exciting technical space It has created this enormous, diverse environment At the same time, it is a giant speculative bubble screaming [at each other and] trying to get rich. But it is also an enormously powerful international that can change the lives of billions. Thank you! [Applause]
