This is my friend Jake. He owns a vintage a video game. Understandably, running so he just never gets around to it. But just needs a little incentive. Jake: &quot;Hey, I'm Jake, and I've spent AIA: &quot;Hey, I'm AIA, and I've Jake: &quot;Do we really have to spin a wheel?&quot; AIA: &quot;Yeah, dude, we have to let fate decide. Jake: &quot;How am I supposed to make all AIA: &quot;Okay, so I thought this might come and they agreed to give me two we have some 3D models we can use Jake: &quot;Okay, I don't know if this but I think I just want to start with a simple how this fence looks; I'm just going to try backdrop. Let's see the clouds. Okay, AIA: &quot;I found these water pistols that I'm that I was never allowed to develop this is a workaround for that. Instead of having I tried to make this multiplayer using Unity's time to do that, but I think I can do it. &quot; looks like a target; maybe it could spin that might be a little too advanced for AIA: &quot;Okay, so after planning yesterday, I got looks a little weird in the scene view to just see on the multiplayer network stuff--there's a lobby Jake: &quot;Let me drag this holy ice cream cone. make a game called 'Sugar Shooter,' where building on this corner, but the color park here on the corner... okay, AIA: &quot;I added some camera cuts for when I felt like it added some needed weight to that but I'm not sure what the alternative to Jake: &quot;Dude, everything is pink. I just made this&quot; AIA: &quot;Yesterday I got multiplayer if we're just playing on a flat plane, so Jake: &quot;...under the pipeline converter. There it is. and then initialize and AIA: &quot;I've been playtesting the map a but I think generally it's okay. I did notice you can do these super high jumps off of stairs.&quot; Jake: &quot;Okay, so I have a prop weapon; The weapon has a good location--I can't AIA: &quot;The player currently has and that's just going to turn the game into include health and ammo pickups. I'm hoping Jake: &quot;So, this is one of the guns I don't know how I'm going to get an AIA: &quot;Footstep sounds are actually really hear where your opponents are. I'm already so I thought it would be smart to tie on the actual animation, I'm calling sound that is synchronized for Jake: &quot;I'm going to see if it shoots. Dude, AIA: &quot;Competition doesn't really so I added a scoreboard. It displays each Jake: &quot;I'm going to have to start from scratch.&quot; AIA: &quot;Earlier, I ran some quick tests and we found a bunch of bugs.&quot; Jake: &quot;Okay, this is what so let's just start all over. I'll play this. I wonder if I could use this. AIA: &quot;Shooting downed opponents currently Jake: &quot;...and I should be able to use on my donuts and all my sweets. Let me AIA: &quot;Players with low frames per second ever registers that they've left floating like this... which Jake: &quot;Please shoot--yes! And if is Listerine. and... I should script and... put the monster script on AIA: &quot;If you spam the reload you just get infinite bullets, so Jake: &quot;Time to hide some sweets--oh, AIA: &quot;Hey buddy, how'd it go?&quot; Jake: &quot;I'm actually pretty proud of Before we get into that, thank you to Unity feel overwhelming, but Unity provides a and a student plan that gives you free assets games. Most of the 3D models Jake and I used in AIA: &quot;Dude, what was your favorite model?&quot; Jake: &quot;The police car was really cool. There but I really liked that one too.&quot; The cool thing about the assets provided help you stay focused on learning how to you're learning to also have to make art, so and if you enjoy making games, you can upgrade in the Unity Asset Store. Bonus! because... with all of the assets there. If you're a college to get access to the student plan. To make it AIA: &quot;Welcome to Sugar Shooter. so we've got... ice cream, we've got Jake: &quot;Okay, nobody calls it a licker.&quot; AIA: &quot;I do think it's a little offensive to a police officer, so... just the donut at the police... I see a theme. Wait, Jake: &quot;It's a little squashed. for 'Police. That's clever! Come on, dude.&quot; AIA: &quot;Have you ever been to a frat party and Jake: &quot;it's Sugar Town, brother. sticky.
