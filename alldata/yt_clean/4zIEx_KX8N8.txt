Your brother has a tumor in the area where his brain is stained. This tumor has oppressed his central nervous system which caused him to keep hitting himself. A tumor? Why didn't we find it out before? His tumor is caused by congestion and squeezing, and it will gradually grow bigger. It should not have grown out when the previous examination was done. So it was not found at that time. Can my brother be cured? It can only be treated by tumor resection. This operation carries risks, but it is the only way to cure him at present. And it must be done quickly. Once the tumor deteriorates without timely treatment, it will threaten his life. I just hope my brother will be okay. How much will it cost? Is that him? Yeah, it's him. Hello. Xiong. Can you lend me some more money? I asked you to pay back the money yesterday. You want to borrow more money without paying back? I know. But I ran into some trouble and need money. Trust me, please. Next time I'll pay you back with interest. Hello? Hello? Hello? Is the signal cut off? Hello? Why are you following me? A Fei Feng. Why you? Not just me. Three years ago, because of that mission my wife and children died, and my brother became a fool. I can't even protect the person I should protect most. Who else can I protect? If I had a choice, I won't bother you. You'd better find someone else. Feng! A Guang and Jay are dead. Only you can do it. Feng. You need a lot of money to pay for your brother's surgery. And now you owe Xiong so much money. How can you cure him? As long as you agree, they will immediately arrange for your brother to be treated by the best doctor in local hospital. You don't have to worry about the cost of the surgery. Well. You know what I mean. Feng. Even for your brother. As tensions rise in Southeast Asia, a shipyard of The Island Country in became the military focus of all countries. As far as we know, The shipyard naturally has the advantage of a port, and it is also a major gateway to various countries. The shipyard is currently being contested by various countries in commercial negotiations. Tian Han. Still. I am the largest shareholder in this shipyard. And I have told you many times, I don't agree to sell the shipyard to Hans. It's just a meal, brother. Business is off while friendship is on. The same place, we'll wait for you there. Zhong, please take care of my brother. No problem. Brother. I'm leaving, now. Let's go. This way please. Boss, the work has been finished as you ordered. Daddy. Yue Yue. I am old, my daughter. I did this with you. See. This is So unsightly. Dad. It's just a tattoo. Not a big deal. And they are couple, great! A couple? Great! Baby. I am doing crazy things with you. But You promised. I've got a bodyguard for you to protect your safety. And you agreed that. Well, Dad. If the bodyguard voluntarily proposes to leave that has nothing to do with me. Don't worry. I know him well. But. You can't play tricks. As for the bodyguard, he is on his way. Daddy! I'm going home. You too. Stop playing outside. Dad. I'll go to my uncle's later. Yue Yue. You should pay attention. Stay away from your uncle. Stop! Dad. Don't lower my favorably impression of you. Let's go. All right. I'm leaving now. Hurry home. Bye-bye. These ships you see are all built by Qi Jia Shipyard. Do you know why it's full of Chinese characters on it? Because most of the ships are sold to Chinese fishing and transportation companies. It's not surprising. Niece, you are even better. You're almost better than me. It's because uncle that you taught well. You are even better than my father. No, you can't say that. Your dad will be mad. I don't care about him. Yue Yue. Didn't your father strongly oppose your tattoo? How did you? Do I have to do everything he says? Funny. Oh, look at you. Uncle, it's time. Dad told me to go home early today. I have to go. Yue Yue. Wait a minute. Global Limited Edition. You've been obsessed with it. I asked my American friend to get it. Uncle! This is awesome. Do you like it? Of course! Thank you very much. Be safe on your way home. I will. Mr. Gao, please have a seat. Mr. Qi is coming soon. This is bought from a French collector. It is valuable. Our Chinese stuff must be kept by ourselves. Feng. Nice to meet you again. Boss, Mr. Hans is here. Oh, Mr. Hans. Welcome. Please have a seat. Mr. Qi. What good thing makes you put into? I was wondering how to convince my brother tomorrow. How? Is your niece satisfied with the mobile phone I sent you? As good as wheat. She likes it very much. Feng, enjoy yourself. Yue Yue. Halt! Why do you come back so late again? Carpe diem! Dad. Honey. Have you eaten yet? Dad. Is he the bodyguard you hired for me? Yep! He is the man I came to see. He is the bodyguard I introduced you to. Dad! My bodyguard? And I doubt his ability. I think the person who needs protection is himself. Yue Yue. Stop being rude. Uncle Rong, see you next time. Enjoy yourselves. Fine. My daughter. I spoiled her. Come on. Let's raise our glasses, Feng. Come on. All right. Why are you here again? Boss isn't here. Please leave. Don't embarrass us. Wu Long. What do you want to do? I've been helping you find the person you want. But in such a huge world, it's won't be that easy to find. Then again, Why should I help you? Three years, I practice hard day and night. Live in purgatory every day. The motivation is to find him. And avenge my lame leg. My leg was lame because of you. Don't tell me it's nothing to do with you. Don't worry. As long as we find him, I'm sure to tell you the first time. He ruined so many things for me. I also want to find him as soon as possible. Take it. Don't bother me again. I want the man. Not money. Qi Yue. You can't look at my cell phone without my permission. How rude. Don't look at me. Haven't you seen a beauty? A bunch of rubbish. You losers. Gao Feng. What are you thinking about? Nothing, Mr. Qi. I have been in a foreign country all these years. I have made some achievements. But I also have many enemies. The real threat to me is my half-brother. He is so ambitious that He can attain his end by hook or by crook. It's all my fault. I brought him here. I'm not worried about myself. I'm old after all. But Yue Yue. She is my only daughter. I don't want anything to happen to her. Gao Feng. This bank card is for you. And give this to Yue Yue. The password is her birthdate. I'm going to attend an important meeting this evening. 8If I don't call back by 8 p.m. You take her away. Take her to the dock. Then take transfer flight back to China. The air ticket is at noon the day after tomorrow. So, both of you must board the ship before the last ship leaves tomorrow. Feng. My daughter's safety is up to you. Please take good care of her. And send her back to China no matter what. OK. I promise you. Hey, brother. Brother. Please have a seat. Look at these dishes. They are all your favorite. Mr. Qi. Nice to see you again. I hope these dishes suits your taste. Thanks. I've already eaten. I'm not hungry now. It doesn't matter. We can drink. Come on. No. I'm on the wagon. Let's have tea. Brother. Mr. Hans came from America. Please be polite. If there is nothing else. I'll leave first. Brother. Don't do that. Mr. Qi. I know. My previous price was lowered. That makes you dissatisfied. This time. I'll add 200 million. 5 I bought your shipyard for $500 million. This price is very suitable. I hope you can agree. And we can sign the contract. Take out the contract. Mr. Hans. I disagree. I'm sorry. I won't sell the shipyard. Mr. Qi. I suggest you think it over carefully. If you don't cooperate with us, you will bear serious consequences. Mr. Hans. you may not understand Chinese very well. I have already told you that my shipyard doesn't sell. Enjoy your time. Brother. Mr. Qi. If I can't get the shipyard, your green card in America will be hopeless. Mr. Hans. Please trust me. You have my word. I'll give you the shipyard. Just give me some time. A Rong. How is the transfer of the shipyard to China going? It's in progress. Hurry up. Hans has been spying for many years. I suspect that Hans and my brother are the murderers who poisoned my father. So the shipyard must not sell it to Hans. Who are you? Let out of me. If he doesn't sign, get his personal seal. With his personal seal we can sign the equity transfer agreement. Not at home. Neither does the shipyard. Where would it be? Mr. Qi. This is the last time we meet before I go back to America. If you don't give me an account, I think we have to terminate our cooperation. If so, you will not only have to refund me 50 million dollars, but also your green card in the United States... Don't worry. Just give me some time. He is my brother. Family or money. Choose one of them. Mr. Hans, I have a question. Why are you willing to spend so much money on a broken shipyard? Everyone knows that the shipyard is not worth that money at all. What we are concerned about is the value behind the shipyard. As for what the value is? You don't need to know. Let out of me. You. Why do you arrest me? Freeze him. You. Who are you? Let out of me. You. Who the hell are you? Let out of me. Let out of me. I've seen this picture somewhere. But I can't remember it now. I think it must have something to do with the seal. That's right. It's not just a tattoo. It contains a specific bar code, which can be scanned by professional instruments. But where is this instrument? You can ask your niece. Why do you do this to my brother? Take it off right now. Brother. I'm sorry about that. What did you call me? Brother. Knock it off. Don't call me brother. You make me sick! No. Blood runs thicker than water. My brother. In preparation for your arrival, I have had so many dishes specially prepared. They are all your taste. Have a try. Oh. That's terrible. I forgot you're a Buddhist and you're a vegetarian. But. Sheep graze but become prey to wolves. Chickens are vegetarian. Finally, they are also killed by human. Tian Han. What are you wanting to do? That's my question, too. You refused Hans's $500 million, but you wanted to sell the shipyard to China at a discount. You are out of your mind. Brother. Mr. Hans has promised. As long as you agree, he can help our whole family get the American green card, including Yue Yue. Tian Han. Don't you have enough now? Why do you still care about American identity? Because I don't want to be stuck on this little island forever, you know? You can also choose to go back to China. We both know what does it mean to sell the shipyard to the United States. I can't let you commit a crime. What's wrong with selling it to Americans? We just aim to make money, aren't we? Brother. Five hundred million dollars! Don't you find it tempting? We live not only for money, but also for conscience. Cut the crap. If you say yes today, we will still be brothers. But if you refuse, you won't be able to get out of this door today. If you want to kidnap me, it doesn't matter. But Tian Han Don't lost in evil. Lost in evil? You bring me the man. I guess he doesn't want to hear your bullshit either. A Rong. I can't believe it's you. Mr. Qi, I'm sorry. I have no choice. Well, Stop standing there. Do what you should do. Open it. There's nothing. Yue Yue also has this tattoo on his foot. This must have something to do with the seal. Say, don't push me. Say. Tough mouth? Ok. Bring my niece here. Hurry up. Qi Tianhan. Make it only between us. Don't hurt Yue Yue. What are you thinking, my brother? She's my niece. Will I hurt her? Hey. Take a picture for me. Deaf? You hear me? Hurry up. Your photographing skills are terrible. You wasted the cell phone my uncle gave me. Boss, we're almost there. Oh. Take your passport and pack your suitcase. Why? Going abroad. Your life is in danger. Hurry up. Look. There. Quickly. Go. Hurry up. Get in the car. Freeze. Close the door. Go. Catch up with them. We are safe now. What can we do now? I'll take you to the dock. Dock? And then? Then you leave here and take transfer flight back to China. My dad. Where is he now? I don't know. Answer the phone quickly. Can you reach my dad? Uncle Maybe it's your uncle who wants to arrest you. That's impossible. Uncle was so kind to me. That's impossible. Your father told me about his relationship with your uncle. Liar. Give it to me. What are you doing? Give it to me. I don't believe it. Give it to me. Give it to me. Calm down. My uncle wouldn't do that. You're crazy. Can you calm down? She run away. Hurry up and catch her. What are you doing back here? Receive the reward? Oh. Boss. It's her bodyguard's fault. Her bodyguard? You two can't handle a bodyguard? What's your use? He is not an ordinary bodyguard. The failure three years ago, was caused by him. That's him? Yes. Boss, please have a look. It's sort of fun. Find A Long. Tell him we found the man he wanted. Go. Did my dad really tell you that? Of course. So, what should we do now? I think you should follow your father's words. What's the matter? Nothing. Who is this woman? You're married, aren't you? Yes. So where is she now? Three years ago, because of an accident, she died. Sorry. What about this man? Feng. How's it going? The operation was a success. Don't worry. We should go. Be careful. Impossible. Isn't he dead? Sit tight. Get in the car. Get out of the car. What's the matter? The car is out of gas. So? It's not far from the dock. Let's walk over. Can't you hitchhike? Do you think there will be a car passing by at this point? Hold on a moment, please. They are heading for the dock now. But the speed is very slow. Just like walking. Get in the car. How far is it? I'm tired. The dock is ahead. Let's rest here for a night. Go. This way. I'm right across the hall from you. You can call me anytime. Have a good rest. I'm scared. You can sleep on the sofa. Damn it. The location is gone. Where did they go? I'm talking to you! Answer me! If boss knew they had run away. He will punish us. Damned cripple, do you hear me? Please. Please. Please. I want to kill him more than you do. If you dare me, I'll kill your boss. You stupid jerk! You're impossible. Wash your mouth with soap! I hate being called a cripple. Especially the damned cripple. Awake? Where did you go? Why did you go out without telling me? Don't you know it's dangerous outside now? If you have an accident, how can I talk to your father? I just went out to buy breakfast All your taste. Let's have some eat. I'm your bodyguard. My duty is to keep you safe. Can you understand? Nothing but bodyguards? Yes. Tell me where he is. Welcome, sir. May I help you? I take something to my friend, but his call phone powered off. Sorry to bother you. What's his name? Gao Feng. Again, don't be a lone wolf. Who gave you this phone? My uncle, what's wrong? I found a tracker inside. That's why they tracked us. What's that? Yours. That's why they want to arrest you. Hurry. Hurry. Hurry up. Go. Go. Close. Close the door. Get in the car. Hurry up. Go. Go. Go. Tumor has been vanished. But his intelligence hasn't been improved and powerless. Don't scare him. And have a good rest. I know. We understand. Thank you. You are welcome. Gao Kong. Come down. It's danger. Come down. Take him away. Zhong. Boss. I sent him as you asked. Him again? Let's get out of the car. I think it's safer in the car. It's okay. I'm here. How can you do that? Hurry up. Get out of the car. I don't want to be in trouble. I had believed that you were dead. Do you remember this bridge? You kicked me down here three years ago. That's the responsibilities. I had no choice. I've been looking for you. Three years. I've been looking for you for three years. What I want is to kill you by myself to prove that I am the best. Only me. There is only one result today. You dead. Back off. Let go. Why do you save me? My duty is to save people, not kill people. Let go, please. I'm a loser. There is no winner or loser in life. Let me go. Let me die. I'm a cripple. A cripple. Live alive is the most important thing for lives. Hey. Brother. Hey. What have you done to my brother? Come here with Yue Yue and the thing I want. Or. Brother. Gao Kong. I'm here. It's OK. It's OK. I'll save you right away. Did they arrest your brother? Let's go. A Rong. Mr. Qi, I'm sorry. A Rong. Maybe it's my fault. Or you wouldn't have done it. This is not my intention. If you agreed to sell the shipyard to Hans. Now the situation is different. A Rong. What did you say? You know. I have devoted my whole life to the shipyard. I know for sure that if you sell the shipyard to the Americans, they will use it to commit crimes. We are Chinese. if we hand over the shipyard to China, we will do something a little for our country. This is a long-cherished wish of mine. So you want to sell the shipyard to China? It's a gift, not a sale. I thought about this decision for a long time. A Rong. No matter how far away and how long we are away from our motherland, fallen leaves return to the roots finally. China is safe. That's why I sent Yue Yue back to China. A Rong. I advise you to stop helping Tian Han commit crimes. All right. Mr. Qi, I take you away. Hurry up. Freeze. Asshole! Knock it off. Get out of the car. Why is dock? Don't we save your brother? Saving my brother is my own business. My last job is to get you here. Give it to me. Right now. Give it to me. Be careful. Boss, it's all your orders. Your brother is coming soon. Happy? Child. You are interesting Tian Han. You're an asshole. Brother. What's wrong with you? You sent his brother away. And he misses his brother. I am helping him. I am helping their brothers get together early. Am I wrong? You. You're impossible. The end justifies the means. You got benefits by betraying family. Now you are utterly isolated. You. Shut up! Don't give me your shit. I just want to make more money and make everyone live better. Am I wrong? There is nothing wrong with making money. But there are many ways, Why do you choose to commit crimes? What? I commit a crime? cAnyway, in your opinion, whatever I have done is wrong, but you were right. Right? Brother. Do you miss your daughter? You'll see her soon. Tian Han. Freeze. I warn you. If you hurt Yue Yue, I will not backing down. Brother. Watch your temper. Come and have a seat. You are old, pay attention to your health. Knock it off. Yue Yue is my niece. How could I hurt her, right? Come on. You take a picture. Here. Child. Stare at the camera. It is nice to meet you at last. Where is my brother? Where is Yue Yue? This is what you want. It has nothing to do with her. I told you to bring her to me with the stuff. She is not here. What's the use of this stupid box? I am here. Yue Yue. I told you to leave. Why are you here? I'm not leaving my dad. Uncle. Why did you do this? Yue Yue. I never meant to hurt you and your dad. I just want I just want what I want. Cut it out. Where's my dad? He is fine. As long as I get the seal, he will be free. Including his brother. And you. You screwed up a lot of my business. Fine. I don't care about you. Yue Yue, come here. Take it. And follow me. No. Freeze. Don't move, or you'll kill your brother. Go. I'll keep your brother safe. Freeze. Where did they go? Freeze. Tell me quickly. Ok. The dock. Let's go. Dad. Dad. Yue Yue. Shouldn't you go back to China? Why are you back? I will never leave you alone, dad. Tian Han. I did not expect that you're crazy! I can't believe it is you who hurt your niece! I have told you a hundred times, my brother. I don't want to hurt anybody. You pushed me! Nobody pushed you ! You stew in your own juice. Cut the crap. Let's begin. Tian Han. Tian Han. Tian Han. This damn seal. It's a sheer waste of time and energy. If you give it to me earlier, everything will be fine, Tian Han. I beg you please. The shipyard can't be sold to Hans. You can't do it. My brother. Survival of the fittest. Nothing is necessary in this world. You again? Inexorably hangs on. Gao Feng. Come here. Yue Yue. Freeze. Go astern. Or I'll shoot him. Yue Yue. Yue Yue. Yue Yue. Freeze. Freeze. Yue Yue. Gao Feng. Yue Yue. You ruined so many things for me three years ago. Today you do it again. Tian Han. You were the one who tried to kill me three years ago. That's right. I have told you nothing can stop me! I will kill whoever dares to stop me. Just for the sake of the American green card, you poisoned father, and hurt your family. You are frenzied. What? Family? Sounds warm. You preached me. You bewared of me. Did you regard me as your family? Ouch! Ouch! Don't be afraid. Gao Kong. I am here. Freeze. Or I'll shoot him. Yue Yue. Freeze. Yue Yue. Brother. Brother. I Maybe it's my fault.

If were to live the life twice, be a good man. Don't turn astray again. An An I am coming. Sorry. For Gao Kong. I have to do this. Maybe I'll take him out of here for a while. In the future, I can't come here for you and for our son very often. Please forgive me. Please forgive me. Where are we going, bro.? Hello, Mr. Xiong. Did you get the money? I'm sorry to have kept you in arrears for so long. All right. I'm relieved to hand over the shipyard to China. It is his noble spirit for bodyguard to risk his live to protect the Lord.
