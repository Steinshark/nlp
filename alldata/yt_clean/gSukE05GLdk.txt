[Laughter] Oh my god! There are a lot of really funny things in my line of work, but to be honest, I tend to laugh even when those things aren't that funny. In fact, I just have laughter like kind of ingrained in my speech. I mean, I'm like kind of half laughing right now. So today we decided to take advantage of my lack of laughter control for your entertainment. A while back I asked you on my community tab to submit the funniest mods you could find, and I've already gone through a few of them in a previous video. That one ended, um, hold- [Singing] If you thought that video was scraping the bottom of the barrel for mods, well, imagine what mods were left over. We went through and curated this exact same form again to find the funniest, most absurd, absolutely cursed mods we could possibly get. And this time, I genuinely have no idea what we're about to see. My production manager went through and found mods that she thought would make me laugh, so not only is this selection of mods cursed, but it's also directly targeted at me. This is gonna be really difficult. [Laughs] three times, the video ends. But if I manage to make it through all 15 mods selected for me, I'll be doing a bit- [Beep] [Beep] Attention. If you were seeing this, then you have been chosen for a top priority secret mission. A mission so important, you're already required to take part now that you've seen my face. This mission, which you are definitely now a part of, could change the scope of human history as you know it. It could truly change your life and the lives of everyone around you. What is that mission? [Music] Hang out with me, please. I want a friend. You know, I'm kinda stuck with Knarfy, and I feel like he doesn't treat me that well, you know? He calls me names, and I get the feeling he doesn't really want me around. I mean, just look at this video. Hey, DK, how's it going? Hey, man. DK, why does he call me that? Does he see me as a giant monkey or something? That's so rude. He must despise me. You know, one time he kicked me out of his house just because he didn't like how cool my jacket looked? Man, I really want that jacket. He wants my jacket? Why? Is that a threat? Does he hate it? So he wants to steal it and burn it? What a terrible thing to do. How can he do this to me? I'm going outside. Isn't that just messed up? You feel bad for me, right? So please hang out with me. All you need to do is click the Makeship link in the description and order a dark Knarfy plushie today. And then I'll finally have a new friend that won't beat me up or call me names. I promise I'll be your best friend forever and I'll never do anything bad. And I can live in your house and we can plan crimes together. Hey, man. What's going on in here? Huh? Nothing. I was just trying this camera out. Nice, nice. That sounds cool. Can I join? What? Oh, no. Sorry. the Makeship link in the description. Not to get out of here or anything just because it's limited edition. I think it's cool. I don't want to leave. No. You okay, man? You want to talk about it? You think something's wrong with me? How dare you? I'm sorry about that, guys. I'm going to go check on him real quick. He does really need friends though. So I am glad you're here to get him out of the house a little bit, you know, but you don't have to go to the link in the description if you don't want to. Don't worry too much about that. Anyways, let me send you back to the video. Hold on. Give me a second here. Just hold on. What? So now that you know the stakes of this challenge, we'll start with the oldest set of mods from one point twelve. Oh, and don't worry about that guy. I'm sure it's all right starting now. I'm not allowed to laugh. That's it. That's that's the last time I'm allowed to laugh here. The challenge is starting now. No laugh. No laughing. I am a stoic being. I have zero laughter in me. No laughing. Laughing is not allowed. In fact, I've never laughed a day in my life. I don't laugh. What is laughter? Laughter. This actually is really sad. I actually that's that's really sad. I need to get through all these. There's 15 of them. Oh boy. This is going to be insane. Starting with this one bouncy creepers from Epic Gaming one one one nine five. Give a short description creepers that bounce and pop like a balloon instead of exploding releasing stinky gas. Apparently I'm not supposed to try any of the features. So we're just going to skip this one. Not get bouncy creepers. This is all we get. This is all we get. Wow. All right. I guess we just jump into it jump into it get it because because creepers because because the creep because the creep. Oh man, we're going to 1.12. Oh boy. Here we go. What is this even look like right? What what do bouncy creepers even look like? Did they change the model? Are they just going to look like normal creepers? Creepers spawn creepers, spawn bounce they're separate interesting. Okay, so regular creepers seem pretty normal right bouncy creeper. Oh. Oh, yeah, that's that's good. Why does it have such a big shadow? Why does it have such a big shadow? Oh gosh. Oh the sounds. Oh, the sounds are kind of fantastic. I'm not going to lie. Game mode survival. Let's see what happens. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I forgot what the one of them was a real creeper. Oh my gosh. The bouncing sound effects are so good. That's so good. Okay, wait. So now they pop. Oh, I have nausea. Why do I have nausea? What happened? Oh, here comes another one. Hey buddy. Hey buddy. How's it going? How's it going? Boom. So you get you get levitation and nausea. That's good. That's good. That's a good one. I like this one. That's the guy. That's a funny. Oh, I just broke the game. This is oh my gosh. I broke it. Okay, let's move on to the next one. Too many chickens from Tom Troy 11. Add some chickens. A lot of chickens. Checking them out description and trying out what it does. Throwing netherrack chicken into lava. What is a netherrack chicken? All right, here we go. Let's see what it looks like. Do you ever thought about how vanilla Minecraft chickens are booring? You can only get eggs, feathers, and chickens and that's all, but why not diamonds, emerald, and gold? TMC will improve your Minecraft by adding more than 49 chickens? How to get started. Adventure into any forest tiger or plains biome. Find white chicken and lead it to your house. breed them until you get a necessary amount. Craft any chicken you want by placing white egg in the middle and making a chest pattern around it. You can't get all of the chickens. Oh gosh, this is going to be a lot. Too many chickens, huh? Too many. How many is too many is really the question. I believe I have discovered how many is too many. Oh my gosh. Okay, this is coal, lapis, redstone, iron, golden, diamond. Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamond, diamond. Emerald, emerald, dirt, and oak. Oh my gosh. This one kind of glows. That's kind of cool actually. I'm not going to lie. Look at them. Look at the redstone chickens. Boom egg. Does this spawn an explosive chicken? Oh my gosh. They're... Whoa. What happens if I... Can I... Do you explode? Do they explode? Hold on. Please explode. Please, please explode. It didn't explode. Diamond or egg. This one doesn't work. Why doesn't this one work? It doesn't work. Low stone. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Why is it making fire sounds? Why is it making fire sounds? What in the world? You're not a fire chicken though. You're not a fire chicken. Blaze egg though. Blaze egg. Blaze chickens. Oh my gosh. Horace egg. Oh, they can teleport. Whoa. That's kind of cool actually. Clay. Why are we making chickens out of clay guys? What's the deal here? What's the deal here? Milk egg. It kind of just looks like a normal chicken. Easter egg. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. How many chickens? Just too many chickens? I think we're figuring that out. We're finding the threshold here. This is just a... This is just a dumb amount of chickens. Styrite nether. Obsidian. Obsidian chicken. Whoa. He's kind of spooky actually. Hello. You're kind of spooky. Wow. It died. Okay. All right. Okay. I think we're still kind of in the beginning stages. This is not super funny to me yet. You know, it's not quite getting there yet. But it's warming me up a little bit. I feel like I'm going to win this. Okay. I mean, let's just keep going. You know? Let's just overload myself. I think I can take on more. From Maple, up and down and all around. This is a mod that lets you change the direction that gravity moves players. Apparently I'm supposed to play multiplayer on this, but since this is 1.12, it's a little bit more difficult. It's all right. I'm sure I can do this myself too. I'm sure it'll be fine. We're going to see what happens. Oh, oh wow. That's a screenshot. This actually looks like so much fun. All right. This is going to be really interesting. It's time to mess with gravity. Okay. Gravity controller. Strong gravity controller. What is the, what is the regular gravity controller? Down up. What? Oh, Oh, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa. I'm falling into the sky. That was actually kind of close. I almost just laughed at that. Where am I going? Why am I, what ice? What is, if you discovered firsthand that blood boils in space. That wasn't a laugh. That doesn't count. It doesn't count. That's not a laugh. That's not a laugh. Where'd my stuff go? My stuff is in space. That was crazy. Liquid anti-mask bucket. What? What are you? Why does it do that? Up. Oh, up. I guess I'm going to boil my blood in space again. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. I like, I see how this is. I see what I see what they're doing here. Oh gosh. I think the North gravity anchor. Oh, whoa. Whoa. This is actually kind of cool. Whoa. This is like, this is, this is super trippy. This is what in the world. This feels like breaking Minecraft without crashing. Like did you see the previous video guys? This is so cool. This is so neat. Look at the sheep on the side of the hill. That's so cool. I guess, I guess I'm on the side of the hill actually. Whoa. What in the world? Whoa. Okay. So wait. So there's gravity attuned stuff. What does this do? Gravity generators. This is so cool. Gravity goggles. Whoa. I could. Those eyes almost got me. Those eyes almost got me. Those eyes almost got me. That was, wow. That's funny. I'm actually moment. Actually gravity goes up, goes down. Gravity goes in circle. What happens if I have both in my inventory? Does it do? Can I, what if I throw the North one? Oh, yup. There it is. Yep. Yeah. Okay. So I can fall and I can just keep falling, right? What if I'm getting, what if I'm like in the clouds, you know? I'm just falling, you know, this is, this is amazing. You need to travel hundreds of thousands of blocks. Like this is the way to go, bro. Gravity is crazy. Those eyes, those eyes, those eyes are, those eyes are wild. Look at that. I'm 3000 blocks away already. This is just how you can travel. And then you need to stop and you just throw out the gravity controller and now you're back to normal and to the water all good. You know, everything's good. I need to take these off because it's making everything pink. Oh, that's better. Gravitation Pearl. Oh, oh, oh, oh, I threw it and it all, it floated. Whoa, that was cool. What is it doing? I don't know what it's doing. Pushes and pulls entities. Just some of a bunch of sheep. What happens here? Whoa, whoa, they're moving. They're moving. It just keeps him at like a good length, like a little distance away. Oh, I just, I forgot it does that immediately. I forgot it does that immediately. Don't mind me boiling my blood in space. There's an anti-mass. This is, this is wild. How does this North East? Oh, West. And then you hit that and now it's on West. Oh, oh, I'm so disoriented right now. This looks really funny in third person. Okay, down, up. Wait, can you like use this to, oh my gosh, I'm doing back flips, bro. Oh no, that wasn't a laugh. I didn't laugh. I didn't laugh. I don't know what I was talking about. Where am I going? Where am I going? I'm going to space. I'm going to space still. Go back down. Go back down. Don't let your blood boil. Don't let your blood boil. There we go. There we go. Catch myself. Don't mind me just backflipping. Woo, woo, woo. My motion sickness is playing. All right, this is pretty great. This almost got me a few times. The freaking, this freaking, this thing. Look at this thing. One of those lives might have counted, but I'm going to lie to myself and say none of them counted. Ha, we still have three lives. We've still three, but we've also only been through three mods. So let's continue. TNT Yeeter mod from a sheep. Thank you, a sheep. Very cool. Adds a TNT Yeeter mod. Any specific features, never should try laughing. We'll see about that. You guys, YouTuber. Oh, thank you. I don't think that's true, but thank you. Oh, I know about this guy. I love this guy.

What if I did that? Yeah. And then you put TNT on top. Yeah, they look the same. So what happens if I go into survival? This is the real question. Are these hostile? Are these mobs? Hey, yeet. Oh, oh, he says yeet. He says. Oh, I didn't realize they said yeet. That's really good. Wait. Oh no. That's good. That's good. Do they say other yeets? Is it just one yeet? Oh, they do. Oh, they do.

I'm leaving the googly eyes on too. We're leaving them on. I don't know what's going to happen but we're leaving it on. Oh my gosh. That little artwork for that is so good. Where is the pig? Let's see him. Oh yeah. Oh my gosh. The way your head moves. They just don't have googly eyes. They're just large. The baby pigs also are a little bit larger. Oh my gosh. They're so goofy looking.

Oh my gosh. Okay so this is the sword. How does it? Does it work like a normal sword? I'm cursed. That's kind of funny. That's kind of funny. I'm not gonna lie. That's kind of funny. Does this just literally apply levitation and say I'm cursed. That's all it does. They're cursed now. He's cursed. They're cursed. Oh. Rest in peace little pig. Oh. Delft too much damage huh? Okay well yep that makes sense. Okay. What happens with the pickaxe? Whoa. Whoa this is just useful. Whoa this is just. This is just handy. This is. Mining fatigue. I see the downside. I am. I am starting to understand. I'm starting to. Jeez that was. He came out of nowhere. That was. That was. Wow. Wasn't expecting that. Okay. Oh hey pal. Take this. Get cursed. Get cursed. Oh. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. That's really. That's really something. Okay. Okay. This is this is fine. Wow. I'm cursed. It gives you mining fatigue after like five six seven eight nine. This is kind of a random chance I guess. Wow. Okay. That's I mean that's pretty useful otherwise. Like I feel like that's just handy. Like I can mine that entire iron vein. And like too. It's a little annoying. I'm not gonna let. All right. Now I need to figure out how this hole works. Get cursed. Oh. Giggled a little bit. Doesn't count. Doesn't count. It's not. That's not what it was. Okay. I'm gonna. Oh. It's just not work. Does it just not work? Why doesn't it work? Oh. I see why. I see why this is cursed. Yeah, that's that makes sense. That's uh, that's really that's really something. Oh gosh. The group. Why are my, why are my pupils doing that? Is it because I have an effect. What's happening there? Oh, that's weird. That's weird. Wow. So now the cursed TNT that's wow. That's that's crazy. And I like, I turned it into. Okay. Flint and steel go. Do you, what do you. Oh my gosh. It just doesn't move and then it explodes there. Lightning. Oh my gosh. Whoa. This is still getting me. That's still getting me every time. That's really funny. That's really good. That's very fun. All right. Well, let me just, let me just yeet out of this segment real quick and we're going to reset. Get new mods. Yeet. Yeet. All right. means I'm going to run a few of them at once. We're going to run three mods at one time here. This is going to be a little bit more overwhelming starting with flying Fox. All Foxes can now fly. Spawn a bunch of foxes and one chicken. Also try renaming a Fox tails. Okay. Interesting. Interesting. Then we'll be using better than bunnies. Bunnies with top hats. Spawn a bunny. I'm not even going to look at the curse board instances for this. I'm just going to, we're just going to jump into it. And then heads. This mod allows players to wear any mob head. The mob heads may make your head small or giant. Try both the axolotl and skeleton horse head. Okay. Interesting. We're going to just open this up and just see what happens. I'm very excited about this. This is going to be very fun. All right. I need to remember to rename one to tails. We need bunnies and then we need to use the heads. This is going to be a wild combination of features and I kind of hope I don't laugh. I'm kind of nervous about this one actually. Oh, oh, oh, immediately. Oh, immediately. We found them. Oh my gosh. You guys do fly. What the heck flying foxes? Look at them all. Look at them all. Okay. a chicken, one chicken. Gosh, that sounds oh, oh, there they go. They're taking off. Wait, what if I summon a chicken in the air? Do they attack it in the air? Oh my gosh. They all converge on it. A bunch of chickens, a bunch of chickens. Oh my gosh. That's actually pretty great. That's pretty amazing. That's funny. That's funny. That's good. I like it. They're going up. Look at them go. The screams. The screams of the foxes. That's so funny. This is a really weird sight. It's funny that like all of them are like converging on one and then when one of them hits them, they all just fly away. Yup. That checks out. That checks out. Okay, wait. If I grab myself an anvil, do this tails. Tails and then name one. It didn't do anything. Does it have to be lowercase? It does have to be lowercase. That's actually kind of awesome. That's pretty great. That's pretty awesome. I'm not going to lie. Wait, if I put this in here, name it tails, then I can just spawn a bunch of tails. All of the tails. So many tails. Yup. This is wow. There's a lot of them. All right. Okay. All right. Let's, let's, let's figure out what's next here. The other thing is better rabbits. Oh, look at this little man. Oh. I forgot that foxes attack rabbits. Oh, look at this little distinguished gentleman. They're so cute. They're so precious. Look at this guy. He's got a little, He's a little distinguished gentleman. Look at him go. Hey little guy. Look at him. Look at this guy. This is, oh, look at this man. Oh, rest in peace. Distinguished gentleman. Oh my gosh. The sounds man. The sounds are crazy. Look at this. Look at this insanity in the sky. Look at him go. Look at him go. Gosh, that's terrible. Oh man. All right. Okay. cute, but also look at this. Ironically, there's no bunny head, but there are cat heads. And if you put it, oh, that's good. Oh, that's good. Oh, that's good. Wait. Axolotl head. It's so small. It's so small. What is the, why is it so small? The bat head. The bat head is good. That's funny. Wait, can I be a fox? Look guys, it's me, Fundy. Hey, it's me. Welcome back to Fundy. Gassed head. What is the gassed? Oh, it just looks normal. Okay. I was kind of half expecting it to be just absolutely massive. What about the skeleton horse? I exhaled. It wasn't a laugh. That's good. That's funny. That's really good. Okay, wait. I have a, that looks really funny. I'm sorry. I have an idea. I'm just going to. That was a sound. Jeez. Zombies can wear heads, right? So if I put a zombie in here, put a dispenser here, right? And then I take the skeleton skull and then I push the button. Oh, what happens if I just, it just dispenses it to me. Oh my gosh. That donkey head. Oh, oh, oh no. Oh no. Oh no. Shaven sheep head. Oh geez. Okay. Well, I just need to go through these again. Glow squid. Oh, oh, oh. I don't know if I like that. Oh my gosh. Turtle head. Oh, oh, that's really good. That's really funny. I don't think I left there. No. What is this silver fish? Wait, I dropped it. Silver fish head. Oh, that's funny too. That's good. That's good. Can you like place these? You can place them down. That's awesome. That's actually kind of amazing. I wish that this was like, what? Wait, endermet. This is just, just a placeable endermite without a tail for some reason. That's wow. Okay. It feels like a great way to disguise yourself. That's good. You're gonna be a wandering trader. Wow. This is so cursed. I hate everything about this. This is like, this is... Oh no. Does that count? No. I think that counts. Dang it. No, no, no, no. Dang it. That was kind of in passing too. See this is the struggle. This is my struggle. I just laugh in passing and it counts. Dang it. This is fun. That's funny. Now I can laugh at it. That's funny. That's pretty... Oh man. Oh man. Fine. Whatever. Two. I don't even feel like that. That wasn't even that good of a laugh. That was just a passing like giggle. I need to be, I need to have more self-control, man. Five more to not laugh. I have one life left. And the second one was just kind of a... All right. Let's see what's next. &quot;Cursed keys.&quot; &quot;Give a short description of what this mod has to offer.&quot; &quot;Chaos and suffering.&quot; Also says play with friends, but I don't have any friends. Just kidding. I just don't have any friends here right now. I'm great. &quot;Any specific features or if you should try all of the keys your keyboard has to offer.&quot; All right. You got it. Let's see it. Would you like to play in safe mode? I don't like that it's giving me the option to turn on a safe mode, but no. No safe mode for me. No. Oh my. Oh my. I should probably be in survival mode. Oh my. Oh no. Oh. Oh no. Oh. Oh. Whoa. Whoa. Does this have like... What? That's crazy. Do I... When I walk I just get wither. What is my... My right key by and gives me just ridiculous speed. What do you want from me? All right. Okay. Oh, oh, oh, oh no. All I did was I just pressed a bunch of... I just pushed a bunch of keys on my keyboard and I somehow went to the nether and died. What? What? Dude, I cannot laugh at this one. I can't laugh at this one because I have a whole other mod pack that's going to happen. I'm too bad at this. Self control. Self control. That's crazy. I'm just going to push every key on my keyboard again. I went to the end and then I blew up. I'm going to crash the game. What is happening? Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Okay. I have to move on. This is very funny. I have to move on. I have to. I just know that it's going to immediately overwhelm me and I'm not even going to be able to get to this last mod pack. We're going to start with this one. Silly rendering. Because apparently I was told to launch this once and then immediately close it because it gives people a headache. We're going to find out what that means. Oh, I understand why this gives people a headache. Hold on. I got to set all my key buttons. I'm doing this in the small mode so I don't just immediately die. Oh my gosh. This is, I don't even want to look at that. This looks wild. What? Now this is, this, what, I don't even know what to say to this. This just hurts. What? Oh my gosh. There's another mod. What is my hand doing? What the heck? This is crazy looking. I kind of love that the blocks themselves don't move. They just kind of sit there and they just, they just start just broken. Everything is, wow, this is broken. Look at the water. Oh no. The turtles, man. The turtles. What did they do to you? Wow. This is, oh, the clouds even. The sun. The sun be wiggling. Where's my, I don't even know if this is funny. This is just horrible. Wow. seeing on screen right now. Okay. I'm disabling this part and we're going to, we're going to, we're going to do the other mods in this one. One of the mods that I have on this instance is this, the daily dad, which I think does dad jokes. And that's kind of amazing. We've also got souper secret settings, which changes your shaders with soup. You drink soup and it changes how everything looks. I like that. And then we have lucky TNT mod, which is interesting because my production manager created a resource pack that hides the names of the TNT. So we're going to see how that goes. And all of those are enabled on this world. Oh boy. This is the final reckoning for me. If I don't laugh on this, then I win. But if I do laugh, then I lose because I have one life left. Oh boy. Daily dad. I never wanted to believe that my dad was stealing from his job as a road worker, but when I got home, all the signs were there. I'm just going to open this world a couple of times and just see what it comes up with. Why are basketball players messy eaters? Because they are always dribbling. There better be like a terrible laugh track behind all of these. That's the only way that I'm going to save that. You know, that's all that's all we get. What kind of music do mummy's like rap, you know, more than anything. These just make me angry. Why did the sentence fail? The driving test. It never came to a full stop. Isn't that the point of isn't that the end of a sentence though is the period is full stop. One more. One more. When I left school, I passed every one of my exams with the exception of Greek mythology. It always was my Achilles elbow. Okay. That was good. Okay. That one's good. Okay. All right. Okay. I'm going to drink some soup now. That's a lot of, that's a lot of TNT. Okay. So what she's done is, oh, oh wow. Okay. So there's 10 of them in total that I'm going to have to check out, but hold on first. She got to drink some beetroot soup, baby. Got to drink some soup. Whoa. Whoa. Okay. Sorry. I can't, my, I think I need my glasses on. Oh, everything's upside down. Okay. Oh, contrast. Oh, that's a weird one. That's wild. What, what is that? Oh, whoa. Green, green. Is this, is this what it's like to be like color blind? Oh my gosh. Oh, I don't like that one at all. Oh my gosh. Okay. I'm, I now I really can't see. Oh, that's slightly less. Oh, that's kind of cool. I like that one. Oh, oh, oh, oh my word. Okay. Okay. We're back on that. Oh wow. Oh man. That's kind of cool. Actually. I kind of like that one. That's neat. Oh, oh, it's back to normal. I sure hope it's back to normal. I can't tell, but that's enough for me. That's enough for me. Okay. All right. Now I'm curious about these TNTs. We're going to go in order. One, two, three. All right. Starting with number one. This is number one. I'm kind of assuming it's something to do with wool and disco. Yeah, that's a lot of wool, but not a lot of disco. Oh, that's actually kind of, whoa, that's actually kind of neat. What? Wait, do it again. Do it again. Turn this entire place into wool. Go. That's cool. No, this reminds me of, there's a bunch of like TikToks going around right now where people are building worlds out of wool and pretending that like it's the Truman show where they're like watching a player going in there and doing stuff. You know, it's, it's kind of cool. It's kind of a fun concept. That's what this reminds me of. I don't know what this one is. What is this one going to do? This is the second one. What do you do? Whoa. Okay. Wow. That was a lot. Oh, that guy's, that guy's dead. Okay. Well, I'm, I just want to, I'm just going to, difficultly peaceful, difficultly normal. Okay. We're going to just see what happens on this one. This looks Irish. Is this an Irish TNT? Oh, oh, potatoes. There's more. There's more. There's so many. There's so many. Why are there so many? Where did they come from? That's a lot of food. Okay. Five. We got two of them to do at the same time for number five because they both say number five. Number four doesn't exist. We're going to light them at exactly the same time. Here we go. Three, two, one. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh no. What did, what is that? What happened? Oh, I'm in a wall. God, let me out of the wall. I'm in a chest. Um, um, um, um, um, I'm stuck down here. There's a furnace down here. What is happening? Huh? What? What? What happened? What happened? That's a, that's crazy. That's a lot. I don't know. I'm trying to hold off from laughing here. Okay. What is this one? It looks like a Christmas present. Does this, what does this one actually do? So we live all at the same time. One of them I think was a village. What does this one do? Does it, oh, does it make everything like Christmas? Is that what it is? Cause there's a bunch of snow now. Oh, but it also just, oh, it drops presents like it's, like it's Santa dropping presents. It's just a, it's basically a Christmas TNT. Okay. That's good. That's good. All right, go back to survival mode. This one looks really dangerous. Oh, um, hold on. Okay. I feel like I shouldn't be this close to it. Oh, okay. Oh my gosh. Okay. No, wait, no. What the heck? I was not expecting it to be that. Oh my gosh. I was not expecting that. Dang it. It's the unexpected stuff that gets me. That's my, that was my third laugh, dude. All right. Seven, eight, and then nine and death apparently. Hey, wait. All right. Okay. All right. Seven. We're going to run through these real quick because I already lost. Seven. Oh, oh my gosh. What is this mud? This is crazy. Okay. That's seven. This is eight. The eight looks like a volcano. This is just going to make a volcano, isn't it? Now it's just natural. That's so loud. That's so loud. That's so loud. That's so many. That's so, we've destroyed this world. That's insane. And then this one's nine, which I think looks like a meteor shower. Yep. Yeah. are probably all going to be just as powerful. Oh, not quite, but pretty powerful. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. The destruction. Okay. Wow. This is, oh man, this is still going. It's still going. I feel like I need to move. I feel like I need to leave. It's still going. There's so much. There's so many. All right. I could not, you know, I don't regret laughing on a little bit of chaos. Well, this has been fun. Um, hopefully you enjoyed this as much as I did. If you did subscribe, leave a like all the things and we'll see you next time. I don't know what this death TNT does. Nothing. Anyways, by the plushy. Uh, I'll see you guys next time. Okay. All right. Well, okay. [inaudible] I cause immense Chaos hehehe
