Welcome to this month's JackSucksAtGeography Reddit video. If you wanna join 34,000 others, and post something for then the link is at the This month's top post, &quot;Someone was rude and wrote the N-word I decided to change that.&quot; Oh, so you've changed the and it's just got a little Nigerian flag. That's so good. &quot;You did the right thing.&quot; &quot;Agreed.&quot; &quot;Also agreed.&quot; &quot;I agree with this statement.&quot; Oh, that's proper cute, isn't it? &quot;The Seychelles flag Okay, enhance, enhance. The actual Seychelles flag and then Hungary's three colours. But following that logic, we could also make Belgium and Luxembourg, which looks really striking. That's pretty cool. Italy and Austria, okay. France and Luxembourg. Netherlands of Belgium works well. It's the black and the yellow in Belgium, that's what makes stuff stand out. Austrian and Hungary. Mali and Guinea, that's Estonia and Russia, kind of cool. And Belarus and Russia. These are epic, I like 'em. &quot;Is your flag easy to draw?&quot; So the Moroccan flag, the and the Switzerland flag, not a problem. But then the Turkmenistan the Fijian flag, and finally Yeah, a bit of a nightmare to draw. Look at that. It's literally impossible. (laughs) &quot;I got a flag phone case.&quot; Oh, that is epic! I need me one of those. I am not about to name every single flag, I'll just get a bunch wrong and you'll all make fun No, no, no. &quot;Wait a minute. What?&quot; So you've evaluated my face and apparently I look 8% Qatari, and 8% Vatican. Well, that's really accurate. (laughing) &quot;When you realise Captain America's suit doesn't have 50 stars, so he's actually Captain Puerto Rico.&quot; Yep, technically. Makes sense to me. &quot;The world if the bottom Oh, I love these two Australia Particularly the New Zealand one. I'm not so sure about the Canada one. I feel like Canada's flag's pretty good. &quot;What's your favourite African flag?&quot; Ooh, now that's a tricky one. Obviously I really do love the Seychelles, so I would have to go with that. But what about continental Africa? The South African flag's really cool. I definitely like the Ethiopian flag. I even like the Central I just think there's something Let's see what you all said. &quot;Seychelles, South Africa, and Botswana.&quot; Yeah, fair enough. &quot;Unpopular opinion, which is this one for your reference. &quot;I like the colours.&quot; Yeah, I know what you mean. &quot;Cape Verde.&quot; Ooh, here's the Cape Verde flag. Side note, Kai who edits must have so many flags saved (laughing) Yeah, the Cape Verde flag, it's all right. I wouldn't pick it as one of my faves. &quot;Seychelles, no competition.&quot; Yeah, it's a very nice flag, isn't it? &quot;Jack saying that Mozambique is the only country that has every vowel.&quot; Ah. &quot;Jack when he finally realises Democratic Republic of Dominican Republic, all Ah. Yeah, I know. I think I've acknowledged this already. So I got the stat wrong. It's not that it's got every vowel, it's that it's got every vowel only once. There's an O, there's an A, and there's an E. I need to remember that. 'Cause you know, I should not on my platform, and I'm Oh my god. &quot;This was my five year old's That is incredible! A Seychelles, Saint Lucia combo. Oh, God. &quot;Needed something to do on Well, you did a much, when I tried to draw Europe. I reckon your UK looks a bit big, but other than that, very nice. Speaking of the UK, some on Northern Ireland's little bit lining up with the rest of the flag. Oh! (making kissing sounds) &quot;If this post gets 998 upvotes, Jack will do all 197 countries and donate PS50 (laughing) Oh, I would've loved oh, look at that. It only got 230, so I can't do it now. Oh, nevermind. I'll tell you what though. If you wanna post some that I can do from my computer, maybe I will attempt the top post of the next JackSucksAtGeography &quot;Guess where I'm from?&quot; Oh my God, there's a building on fire. All right, well ignoring that, This registration plate's the key. It's somewhere in the EU, isn't it? I mean, it could just be the The cars all look very much like the cars that I'm as does the buildings. Yeah, I'm just gonna submit Ireland. It is Ireland! Yeah! The people in the comments are actually guessing the as opposed to just the country as a whole. So that's really kind &quot;I'm trying to paint every I have eight so far. I think you've done an You said you were painting and that is exactly what you've done. Your Bangladesh flag does &quot;How to say 'shut up' in Europe.&quot; Okay, so in the UK it's &quot;shut up&quot;. In Germany, it's &quot;halt die klappe.&quot; In France, it's &quot;tais-toi.&quot; In Spain, it's &quot;callate.&quot; In Portugal, it's &quot;cale-se.&quot; In Ireland, it's &quot;stoptar suas.&quot; In Norway, it's &quot;hold kjeft.&quot; In Sweden, it's &quot;hall kaften.&quot; In Finland, it's &quot;turpa kiini.&quot; In Russian, it's &quot;zatknis.&quot; And in Turkey, it's &quot;sus?&quot; (Among Us meeting sound) &quot;What is the first word that comes to mind when I say Canada?&quot; Okay, one word may be Or maybe &quot;moose,&quot; potentially. &quot;For me, it's 'sorry'.&quot; Yeah, &quot;sorry&quot; is like a bit &quot;Maple syrup,&quot; there we go. &quot;Canada.&quot; Fair enough. As a half-American, I'm so tired of everyone making fun of us There are Americans who To prove it, I named all And they're all completely wrong. Why have you put &quot;Chicken&quot; &quot;The Antarctica flag emoji So this is what the flag but actually it's official flag is this. That's weird. Get it sorted out man, Apple! Wake up. &quot;The biggest scam in history.&quot; (laughing) Yeah, so Greenland and Iceland isn't really that icy. I mean, I know if you're actually there, they both have bits of But overall, looking at it from a height, yeah they need to swap. &quot;Can you guess the country?&quot; Ooh, here we go. &quot;They have a population of 2 million, which is over 22 full Wembley stadiums.&quot; That's not very many, that I need more clues. &quot;It is thought to have made The wheel was over 5,000 years old.&quot; Ooh, so I'm thinking maybe it could be like around I don't know. Let's keep going. &quot;It's in the Northern Hemisphere.&quot; Right, okay. &quot;It's one of the cleanest It scored 96 out of 100 in So that's gonna rule out a I'm thinking somewhere in But a population of 2 million... This is hard. I'm a smart enough for this. &quot;It's 20,000 kilometres squared in size, which is around the same So that could be Europe, I guess. &quot;This country's been part of the EU,&quot; so we now know it's definitely in Europe. &quot;The country shares borders &quot;Make your final guess before The mystery country is...&quot; Oh, and there's a little drum. (drum roll plays) Okay, it borders four other countries. I kind of wanna say Denmark, maybe? That feels like the But the first modern wheel? We'll go with it, let's try it. Slovenia? First wooden wheel thought That was good. Well, I'd do more of them. &quot;Petition for Jack to make two JackSucksAtGeography I would, but the posts aren't actually That's why I literally just So if you want me to make I need you to join the Reddit and post some interesting Don't just Google geography Make your own stuff or make stuff related to You know what I mean? Oh, &quot;I took the on a walk. Guess where I'm from?&quot; Yes, it arrived! So I gave this away, And it's quite rare when that people like let me know it's arrived. So this is so nice to see! Look at that, a signed I mean, I literally so I know roughly where But feel free to pause the This last picture's also but yes the correct answer was Germany. Congratulations once again on winning the signed JackSucksAtGeography &quot;My son asked me to cross-stitch Oh my god. What? That must have took ages! That's so intricate! What? The what? You've done a bloody parrot? That's crazy. You are quite the cross-stitcher. &quot;Do you know this one, Jack?&quot; No. No, I don't. I'm sorry that you are and I'm too stupid to If you know, please let Apparently this took three and it is really, really impressive. You did a great job. &quot;Based on my room, where Very hard.&quot; Oh my god. So it's obviously somewhere in the US, but after that, I have no clue. Go on, then. We'll enhance, enhance. See what we can work out. So this is the Californian flag. So we'll hope that we know the state. Then there's a picture of you So that's also California. As if there's Minecraft drawings right below a Trump sticker. (laughing) I don't know anywhere more &quot;You live in California, Trump, and the Lord.&quot; (laughing) &quot;Did you know the United is nearly identical to (Jack laughing mockingly) &quot;Can you guess the country? Part two.&quot; All right, we got it wrong the first time. &quot;This country is around the same size as the US state of West Virginia. This country shares no borders.&quot; Oh. &quot;Maybe it's an island,&quot; question mark. Hmm. I reckon so. &quot;This country's in the It's close to the equator.&quot; Okay. So if it's an island, it's or one of the Caribbean countries. &quot;This country has a population Could be Sri Lanka. &quot;This country is home to I'm locking in Sri Let's just skip to the end. Go on. It was Sri Lanka. Bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop. &quot;The Liberian province flags must be the ugliest flags out there.&quot; (record scratches) Is that a real flag? That's a flag! Oh my god. So I've seen this one before. But that... (laughing) Look at that tree! These are so, so weird. But that first one, what is that? &quot;Animated flag of The Bahamas.&quot; Oh, it's like windy and waft-y. Is that meant to be the sea I don't know what's &quot;Found this. Should I buy it?&quot; Yes, absolutely. &quot;Today, 247 years ago, the Oh, think how much they're on the 250-year anniversary. (laughing) &quot;Just a normal flag.&quot; All right, the Pepsi logo's I mean, it just works though. I feel a lot of people wouldn't Oh no, it's this again. I struggled with this so much last month. Right, so I have to take the flags and work out what the country is. So the very first letter, this is Eritrea? Or is it Equatorial Well, they both begin So it's a country that starts with E. Then the second letter, So that's G. So it would be E-G. Then this is Yemen. Egypt. It's gonna be Egypt. I know it. I don't need to go any further. &quot;Her: he must be thinking Him: Kyrgistan, Kirgisstan, &quot;I drew some flags this week and I thought they looked pretty good.&quot; You know what? Look at that Moldovan flag. Yeah, you've done a good job. You're definitely better &quot;Did you guys know that has half a billion views?&quot; (laughing) No, I didn't. Half a billion? I will never understand the success that JackSucksAtGeography had. Like it was literally just a It was just meant to be an easy way for me to do some fun GeoGuessr videos, but now here we are. This has consistently been for like the last 12 months I think. So it really has become like a huge essential piece of my job now. Yeah, I will keep whacking out the weekly, sometimes biweekly videos. &quot;A map of Indian states with flags of countries My state would be Turkey.&quot; So this is actually a really good way of demonstrating how populated India is. So for example, all of equates to the population Same with Mexico over here. Ethiopia? How many 120 million. So there's 120 million people just in this little area of India. Argentina's there as Turkey. That's crazy. &quot;A map of the world without countries with over 100 million people.&quot; Africa seems to actually Although it'd probably We just can't see. &quot;Can you guess the country I'll give it a go. &quot;This country might disappear soon.&quot; Okay. &quot;This country is made entirely of atolls.&quot; So it's gonna be somewhere in Oceania. It could be Tuvalu. That's what I'm gonna guess so far. &quot;One of the smallest Tuvalu would work. &quot;40% of this country is underwater.&quot; I guess I'll just lock in Tuvalu. &quot;This is one of the few countries that doesn't use credit cards.&quot; I don't know. I think I'll Yes, it was Tuvalu! I know things sometimes. (laughing) &quot;Can Jack get 10 out of 10?&quot; We will find out. Let's see. - Okay, starting off with What country starts- - Philippines. I expect most people (upbeat music) - Look at him nodding silently. - That is the Philippines. - To our next one, what country starts- - Okay, I've got it. There's two countries this can be, both of them should be - Poland, Portugal. God, the way he nods is- - so funny. - Okay, you're already starting What country starts- - with the letters S-L? - There's two countries and they both sound pretty similar. - We already got it. We already got it. Skip ahead. - Slovenia and Slovakia. - Okay, moving onto our What country starts- - with the letters C-R? After this, they're That is Croatia. - Yes, bro. What country starts with the letters- - Syria. This is the first of our hard ones. If you guys can get all these - Easy dob. Easy dob. Not a problem, thank you. Just quickly, if like my - Shut up! (laughing) - Starts with the letters R-E. - This one's a really tricky one that you're gonna have to think about if you wanna figure it out. Re, re. I don't know! - That is the Republic of Congo. (Jack shrieking) Okay, moving on to our next one. - Ghana. - I got that one. - I got that one. Okay. - 9 outta 10's what I'm aiming for. I want 9 outta 10. - That is Ghana. Okay, getting pretty close to the end. - Bhutan, please. with the letters B-U? There's two countries this can be. These last ones are all very hard. - &quot;Very hard.&quot; (blows raspberry) Not hard enough. More like- - There's Bulgaria and Burundi. (record scratches) - Yeah Bhutan starts with B-H, doesn't it? (sighs) Let's move on. &quot;I wonder what the answer is. Worldle. Can you guess the flag for Guam?&quot; (Jack laughing) Do you know what? That reminds me. We may as well. (upbeat music) All right, we're doing Worldle, but I've got the country outline hidden. Let's go with Dominica to begin with. Why not? Oh, we're not that far away. 7,000 kilometres. So it's 7,000's quite far to be fair, might actually have reached Asia. Let's go in the middle. Guess. Go on, go on. Ooh, no, no. It's down in Africa. Okay, I'll go Democratic Ooh. Yep, that's more like it. So we're over in Western Africa. Try Burkina Faso, please. Pretty close. I've only got one guess left. This is hard without the Let's reveal it. (gasps) Doesn't give much away. I think that could be Nigeria or Niger. I'm gonna go with Niger. Oh, go on. Ah, no! Oh, I actually have another guess. I'll go with Nigeria then. Yay, we got it. We got it just in time. &quot;I drew every European flag, Oh, you've got two flags wrong. Ooh, what's that gonna be? Hmm. Let me see, let me see. I am gonna guess that you've like, swapped Slovenia and Slovakia by mistake. Yeah. Oh, no, no, I can see it. You've done the Slovakian flag Oh, you idiot. Ha ha ha. &quot;The most used emoji in Oh, lots of butt emojis. Who's using the apple? What's that about? The heart's pretty Hawaii's gone for the crown, We'll just gloss over the aubergines. Don't know why the poop emoji's so high. There's also ice cream squeezing in there. I feel quite uncomfortable &quot;Google Street view car Ah, so jealous. I'd love to see the Google &quot;Australian flag, but I replaced the Okay. &quot;Marshall Island animated flag.&quot; Oh, look at it twinkling. &quot;Union Jack, Onion Jack.&quot; Okay. &quot;What did I pause on?&quot; Oh my God. Why am I making that face? (laughing) I don't like that. And now we got an, &quot;Animated flag Oh, the sun's twinkling Oh, delightful. &quot;Even Mark Rober forgot Oh, that's embarrassing for Mark Rober. As if. How'd he manage that? &quot;Mural piece I designed for my school representing every student's heritage. I'm proud.&quot; Oh, that's so good! Look at that! They're all put together. That's absolutely epic. Yeah, you should be really Everyone's heritage is so varied as well. It'd just be a bunch of &quot;This globe, which I got my mom, seemingly breaks the laws of physics.&quot; Instagram keep advertising these to me.
