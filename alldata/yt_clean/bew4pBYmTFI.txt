&gt;&gt; Today's episode is Go to feals.com/rogue and That's half! [laughs] [old school hiphop intro music] &gt;&gt; All right, we are and Babak Javadi from Red Team Alliance! &gt;&gt; Hey brother. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to lie, It's like the children were playing and the grown ups came downstairs. &gt;&gt; Yeah, the adults are here now. &gt;&gt; Well, in this case something we've talked We did a couple of different hotel safes. We learned about that one that you could just bonk on &gt;&gt; Oh, this thing's a piece of junk. &gt;&gt; Some of these brands, you and they'll pop open, hang on. [suspenseful music] [hand thudding] &gt;&gt; But you guys have a that I was unfamiliar with. &gt;&gt; It doesn't involve like &gt;&gt; Not today, no. We have an actual hospitality safe here. &gt;&gt; Is that the technical term? &gt;&gt; It is, it is the technical about both some methods of and a secret override. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I like the word override. &gt;&gt; You might never notice this but now that you're going to be traveling and checking this out. The next time you're in a hotel room; you see this safe right here? It's got a branding on the front panel. But it has another bit of branding. A little extra brass plate. It's sort of very redundant, to be so enthusiastic about who you are? Most hospitality safes and it's not there to show their name. It's there to not show &gt;&gt; Whoa. &gt;&gt; Wait, that's hiding? &gt;&gt; No! Oh, oh, wait, wait, wait! Oh, no, it's loose! I got it, I got it! I got it. I got it. I got it. Da da dah! &gt;&gt; What? And that's on most of them? &gt;&gt; Most hotel safes will have that. &gt;&gt; Cause you always have &gt;&gt; Oh, sure. &gt;&gt; like the battery. In case all your crappy electronics die, you still need to have &gt;&gt; I'm putting this together, that means it could be picked! Are we going to pick this? &gt;&gt; In the cheesiest way possible! With a horrible looking little cross key rake type tool here. &gt;&gt; So, not thermite? &gt;&gt; It's horrendous. &gt;&gt; For those who understand lock picking and good quality tools, &gt;&gt; We've done a fair bit of This is the first time Is this? &gt;&gt; I'm not familiar What's going on with the cross action? &gt;&gt; So, you've had lock picking lawyer and others on the show before. Pin tumbler locks have a series of pins that stick into the keyway. The blade of the key will ride across them and they'll move into position. This is a series of pins &gt;&gt; Okay would look like a cross. &gt;&gt; Are they all four axes? &gt;&gt; In a good cross lock, they are. &gt;&gt; Wait a minute, you're implying [laughing] a good cross lock. I see where this is going. To be clear, good is relative. I haven't seen-- &gt;&gt; By my metric a good &gt;&gt; Have you seen a hospitality &gt;&gt; Ish? &gt;&gt; I've seen ones that are less bad. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Less bad, we'll go with that. &gt;&gt; That's the most you can is less bad. &gt;&gt; I keep most of mine in my prison wallet whenever I'm traveling. [laughing] &gt;&gt; Well you can also keep &gt;&gt; This guy gets it, this guy gets it. &gt;&gt; So in case you need to &gt;&gt; This looks a lot like the bump keys that we played with before. &gt;&gt; It does. &gt;&gt; Do you use it as a &gt;&gt; You could try that, although, in and out while giving a little bit of rotation pressure. &gt;&gt; Think of it as a combination &gt;&gt; Yeah. we've ever talked about raking. For the uninitiated, I guess a bump key, the idea is you got all and so you pop it in and at the same moment while a little bit of torque causes everything to spin. Is that right? &gt;&gt; More or less. You're throwing a lot of and hoping to get lucky. &gt;&gt; And then raking, I assume is, that, but just trying again and again and again. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes! &gt;&gt; I probably can't do it. I probably, the adults are going to have to-- &gt;&gt; Well, let's lock the &gt;&gt; Okay, good call, good call. &gt;&gt; So, Jason, it's your hotel room. You come around. You set the safe with a code. &gt;&gt; Three to six digits. Let's see. [safe keys beeping] [laughing] &gt;&gt; That's a lot of digits. What is he doing? &gt;&gt; Okay, I got it! &gt;&gt; It sounds like it's very secure. &gt;&gt; I think I remembered it too. Fortunately it's on camera, &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; I've done lock bumping but I assume it's the same thing. You want mild torque but [laughs] &gt;&gt; That's a good way to put it. &gt;&gt; That's a poor way to phrase it. [laughing] Mild torque. [key scraping] Oh, no! Ah, man! I feel like I almost have it, but then I'm at least and I don't feel like But I think this might All right Dev, I'm going to need an adult to show me how easy this is. &gt;&gt; DEVIANT: I got nothing. &gt;&gt; All right! just to spite me. &gt;&gt; Let's see. [key scraping] &gt;&gt; I will do it left handed, actually. Because I am left handed. [key scraping] &gt;&gt; Jeez, Louise! &gt;&gt; Got it. &gt;&gt; Yeah, righteous! Are you kidding me? &gt;&gt; So, where do you get &gt;&gt; The internet. &gt;&gt; Of course! [laughing] &gt;&gt; So, what does that mean? Does that mean that we can't trust hospitality safes? &gt;&gt; You can't trust most &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Great, okay, so if about horrifying things that where can we go? &gt;&gt; Well, if you two want to be we actually teach this if you &gt;&gt; I love that their tagline [laughing] &gt;&gt; And if you know, people maybe it's going to wind up &gt;&gt; Hey, oh, look at that. That's called a generous plug. These gentlemen, class acts. &gt;&gt; Uh huh. &gt;&gt; Brian, there's a lot of weird stuff on the counter at my local truck stop. &gt;&gt; I mean what's so weird about &gt;&gt; Herbal ectasy? &gt;&gt; Prank call audio tapes? &gt;&gt; A thousand different [laughing] &gt;&gt; But the worst thing of all is we're in this weird phase where so that by putting the they're going to fool anyone. I'll bet half of these or sniffed it or walked by it once. &gt;&gt; That's the trend now, the you know Dairy Queen's [laughing] And it's, everyone's just putting in it. &gt;&gt; But the problem is, you and what's not and what I at Feals is man, they First of all, they got a You can talk to a human and they will be very clear about this. They're going to send you a their oils that are infused and they say very clearly, start with the least, work your way up. Unlike a CBD infused yogurt, &gt;&gt; Ducked out at the truck stop. [laughing] My first experience of it anxiety and sleeplessness and boy did it. I took one of those naps where I woke up and I wasn't sure who I was. &gt;&gt; You don't know what day it was. &gt;&gt; It was incredibly &gt;&gt; They're really smart about on what's not happening, For example they say, I your head spin around with other thoughts, noticed that you're not noticed that you're It's an emerging science, to use CBD but these dudes the entire way. &gt;&gt; And they deliver right to you know, go to the truck stop And say, oh, &gt;&gt; Well that's yogurt, [laughing] with Toby Keith's face on it. &gt;&gt; Join the Feals community to your door every month.
