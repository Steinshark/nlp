Wait, I saw my friend do this once! I'll just do her little changing trick! First, pull one arm out of its hole. Grab the new shirt And slip both arms through the arm holes. Carefully, put your head through. Pull the shirt down over your torso. Then put the old shirt over your head, And pull the rest of it off your arm. Boom! Pretty nifty, huh? I definitely have to wash that later. And just in time for class! Oh no, is he behind the door? Oh, thank goodness. This movie's nuts. I definitely forgot about the meeting! I gotta get ready! Gah!!

Think I can use this Pringles can? Instead of throwing one of these away, Turn it into something new! But you'll have to cut it in half first. Wrap it in colorful paper. We chose orange!

That aloe gel really does wonders! Check out that major difference! You seriously saved the day, Betty. I'm never buying eyebrow gel again! Beautiful, Bella! Plant power is awesome. Whoever said pigtails are just for kids is seriously delusional. Why not take things up a notch? Hello, little buns! They won't stay. Mind if I fold over here? This laundry is taking up my whole day.
