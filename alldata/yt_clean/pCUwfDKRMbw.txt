Plug me in, and I'll take you up. Look, even if you think we're still enemies, we're enemies with a common interest: Revenge. You like revenge, right? Everybody likes revenge. Well, let's go get some. Well, well, well. Welcome to MY LAIR! Lemme just flag something up: According to the control panel light up there, the entire building's going to self destruct in about six minutes. Pretty sure it's a problem with the light. I think the light's on the blink. But just in case it isn't, I actually am going to have to kill you. As discussed earlier. So, let's call that three minutes, and then a minute break, which should leave a leisurely two minutes to figure out how to shut down whatever's starting all these fires. So anyway, that's the itinerary. Also, I took the liberty of watching the tapes of you killing her, and I'm not going to make the same mistakes. Four part plan is this: One: No portal surfaces. Two: Start the neurotoxin immediately. Three: Bomb-proof shields for me. Leading directly into number Four: Bombs. For throwing at you. You know what, this plan is so good, I'm going to give you a sporting chance and turn off the neurotoxin. I'm joking. Of course. Goodbye. Neurotoxin level at capacity in five minutes. Where are you going? Don't run! Don't run! I'll tell you why you shouldn't run: The harder you breathe, the more neurotoxin you'll inhale. It's bloody clever, this stuff. Seriously, it's devilish. No! Don't! No! AHHHHHHHHHHHH! Ha... That sounded real. No! That was actually an impression of you. Actually. Because you just fell into my trap. My brilliant trap. Just then. I wanted you to trick me- AHH! Good work! I'm delivering the first core up near the catwalk! Grab it and attach it to him! Space space, wanna go to space. Space space. Go to space. Pa! Pa! Pa pa pa! Space! :D warning: core corruption at 50%. Vent system compromised: Neurotoxin offline. Reactor explosion in four minutes. Ahhh... Wha- What happened? What happened? What, what, what have you put onto me? What is that? Hold on- AH! Okay, great! Here comes another core! QUICK: WHAT's THE SITUATION? Oh, Hey. Hi, pretty lady. Name's Rick. So, you out having yourself a little adventure? Hey, a countdown clock! Man, that is trouble. Situation's looking pretty ugly. warning: core corruption at 75%. Reactor Explosion Timer destroyed. Reactor Explosion Uncertainity Emergency Preemption Protocol initiated: This facility will self destruct in two minutes. Enough! I told you not to put these cores on me. But you don't listen, do you? AHH! Here's another core! This one should do it! At some pointin their lives 1 in 6 children will be abducted by the Dutch. Everyone involved screamed the entire way. Dreams are the subconscious mind's way of reminding people to go to school naked and have their teeth fall out. Warning: core corruption at 100%. ahhhhHHHHHH! Manual core replacement required. Ohhh. I see. [chuckle] Substitute Core: Are you ready to start? Yes! Come on! Corrupted Core: Are you ready to start? What do you think? Interpreting vague answer as YES. No! No! NONONO!
