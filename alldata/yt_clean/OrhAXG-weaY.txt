- Let's go. / - Go on in. Go on in, Ayeong. - Why isn't he coming? / - Go on in. Take your belongings. Inseong. Seungu, go on in. Heave-ho. Your dad isn't here, - so it's hard. / - You did grocery shopping. - Yes, with my children. / - Your hands are full. (Why are they at an unfamiliar place?) (It isn't the house of the 4 siblings we're used to.) Why isn't he coming? (They enter comfortably as if it's their own house.) The fan. (The second child turns on the fan with his toes.) (The third child and the youngest one are relaxed too.) - Is that your house? / - No, - it's my in-laws' house. / - I see. That used to be our house. - I see. / - We used to live there. - They moved into the house. / - Yes. Our house is a five-minute walk from there. (They moved 5 minutes away from their old house.) To children, it's their old house. - They're used to it. / - That's why they look relaxed. - They're used to it. / - That's right. My in-laws run a restaurant, so they come home late. (Grandma and Grandpa are at the restaurant.) No one's home. Come here. I have work today, so I need to leave the children with my in-laws. That's why I'm here. (I came to leave my children with the in-laws.) It's so quiet. (While the eldest child takes care of the others,) (she puts away the groceries.) There are so many items. Seriously. - Just putting them away is a hassle. / - It is. There are so many items. I was so surprised. If I just leave the children there, - I'll feel bad. / - That's right. So I bought the food my children would eat. - You bought the ingredients. / - Yes. Despite having work that day, you practiced and got groceries at the mart. You're so busy. I'm used to leading a hectic life. (A working mom's day is so busy.) (She can't do this alone.) Mom, do you need help with anything? (But she has her first child, her bodyguard!) - Jaeun is helping his mom today. / - My goodness. - Jaeun is the best. / - He's so dependable. Any in-laws would love him. (National host approves of the national son-in-law) - When will Father come? / - What? - When will Father come? / - He came. - I came. / - Dad came. What a timing. You came home after we finished grocery shopping. Gosh, he didn't go grocery shopping with them. (Carefree) - I can't complain about him. / - Seriously. - He has a smiley face. / - He has a smiley face. - He looks so kind. / - Yes. When the family needs to do something together, - my husband disappears. / - For goodness' sake. When things get done, - he reappears. / - Like clockwork. Help me put away the items. Okay. Still, she's giving him a mission. (One tangerine) (and a bag of bread?) (Sniffing) (My goodness) This bread lost its value from getting squished, so I'll eat it. - It got squished. / - What? - He just took his food. / - The bread looks strange. For goodness' sake. Miae asked him to help. - Isn't this bread yours? / - Seriously. You know, he's like a student tenant. (He's like a tenant who pushed off his graduation.) Dad, I want to try it too. Doesn't it look tasty? The shape is quite ugly. - Ugly? / - Yes. - Why is he / - It got squished. making children eat bread before mealtime? I told you to put away the items. Are you doing that by putting the bread in your mouth? - I mean... / - How cool. Stop eating. - Okay. / - Don't feed them bread. - They need to have a meal. / - They won't eat then. Right. If you eat before mealtime... He's giving them tangerines this time. (Let's eat tangerines then.) You need to eat tangerines to keep the cold away. Open your mouth. We need to put things away and set off. At what time do we need to leave? We need to set off in an hour. In an hour? - Yes. / - Oh, my gosh. I was doing that when I had to leave in an hour. You had to cook yourself. (I'll make my children's dinner!) - Fried rice? / - Yes. She cooks fast. - She cooks fast. / - Okay. The fried rice is ready. - There's so much. / - There's so much. That pot is huge. - Is it a stock pot? / - It's huge. - It's for the bone broth. / - Seriously. It's for the bone broth. (She adds the entire pack of beef.) (A bowl of soaked seaweed) It's seaweed soup. (The second menu is Mom's seaweed soup.) It smells so good. It'll taste good too. You're using the meat oil. (Even when she's busy, she cooks for her children!) My goodness. - Seriously... / - She really is a super mom. - I know. / - She really is a super mom. - I have so much respect. / - She works fast. She works fast. I'm not your friend. I want to make a house. - A house? / - No. - Shall we do it together? / - No. - I'll make a house with this. / - Dad. - I'll make a house with this. / - Dad. Let's do it together. (Stealing Inseong's building blocks) - Let's do it together. / - Don't touch it. - Let's do it together. / - Don't touch it. I'll end up losing it. Whose fault is this fight? - Ayeong! / - Inseong. Inseong, I want to make a house too. (&quot;Give me one.&quot; versus &quot;I need every single piece.&quot;) I can't make it without that piece. - They're fighting. / - What? (He was watching.) - Dad is right there, / - Hold on. but the eldest son... Hold on. - Dad... / - What's up with Dad? - Is he a shadow or what? / - He's folding the laundry. He's just sitting there. (He sits down and exudes dark energy.) Together. (They're in trouble.) They became nervous as soon as he appeared. (He grabs their hands without a word.) - The atmosphere changed. / - What's this? Suddenly, the atmosphere turned frigid. - Ayeong. / - Stop fighting. (Stop fighting.) He didn't even raise his voice. &quot;Stop fighting.&quot; - How charismatic. / - How charismatic. (They become quiet right away.) - Stop fighting, okay? / - Stop fighting. I need to learn from him. - Cho Ayeong. / - Yes? This is Inseong's. - Play with yours, okay? / - Okay. (Doesn't take anyone's side and states what's wrong) - Do you understand? / - Yes. - It's your brother's. / - Ayeong, let's play together. (He suddenly feels a wave of sorrow.) Our dear Inseong. - He's crying again. / - He's crying again. Our dear Inseong. He's kind of like me. (I was just making my own.) He's sad. He was just making his own. - I know. / - It belongs to him. - Right, he could feel upset. / - He's upset. - This situation is upsetting. / - Inseong cries a lot. - He's so adorable. / - He's so kind. (Crying) - He's sad. / - He is. Isn't he crying because Jaeun is scary? Is Inseong crying again? (Is the second-eldest crying again?) - Jaeun, you shouldn't... / - I'm sorry. - He's patting him on the head. / - Jaeun is too scary. - You absolutely need Jaeun. / - Right. Yes, that's right. I'm shocked that their dad was just watching from the side. But it was wise that Dad didn't take anyone's side. Their dad... He's trying so hard to make things seem nice. He has to live his life too. Go and hug your brother. Seungu, go and give Inseong a hug too. (Let's hug and make up.) (A kiss on the cheek) They're all kissing him on the cheek and making up. There you go. (The second-eldest comes in with his blocks.) (He eats some bread while he's here.) He's kind of like me. - Yes, he needs some blood sugar. / - Right. He takes care of his heart with some sugar. Hey, kids! Attention! Let's eat! - Clean up. / - Hurry up and clean! - Let's eat. / - That's such a hearty meal. Let's eat. (She brings out a box full of laver too.) Focus. (Like six siblings living in a single room) Who wants gimbap? Open up. - Ayeong, open up. / - Before you go to work, - you're feeding everyone. / - Sit up straight. - It happened within an hour, right? / - I know. Yes. I made a whole bunch of seaweed soup. Don't bother Grandma and Grandpa too much tomorrow. Eat with the seaweed soup I made. (Mom's food is the best, indeed.) Dance if the seaweed soup tastes good. Quickly. - Like seaweed. That's it. / - Goodness. - Like seaweed. Good job. / - When did Seungu get here? - Was it that good, Seungu? / - Like seaweed? - It's the seaweed dance. / - The seaweed dance? Take the dishes back. (They finish eating dinner in a flash.) Inseong, I have to go now. You're even doing the dishes? - Listen to Grandpa and Grandma. / - Okay. Will we meet again on Saturday? No. I love both so much. I'm a working mom. I have to continue my career, and I have to maintain my family too. Of course. All working moms... - want to do well in both / - You're so incredible. work and childcare. We can all relate. You're all so incredible. You're so amazing on stage as - an amazing singer. But at home, / - So charismatic. you're so busy looking after your kids. (The unchanging fact in the meantime) Anyway, being able to do both, maybe not perfectly but still managing to do it, is all thanks to my family. Mom and Dad have to leave now, kids. Grandpa will be here soon. He suddenly appeared. - He's so funny. / - I know. (My babies, the breadwinner is off to work.) - How reliable. / - With your eldest son. - I'll be back. / - Okay. You're giving each of them a hug. (My pretty daughter, I always feel sorry for you.) (Mommy loves you very much.) That's the source of your energy. - That's right. / - That's the source of your energy. (Mommy loves you very much.) You really have to go now. - He won't let go. / - You can't seem to leave then. You end up hugging them even tighter. - Bye. / - We'll be back. - Bye. / - Bye. Jaeun, watch the kids for a bit. Grandpa's almost here. - Okay. / - Bye. - Have a safe trip. / - See you later, Jaeun. Okay. - Goodness. / - She's our Super Mom. So much respect for you today as well. Thank you. Seriously, I admit it. You're a Super Mom. You're on a whole other level.
