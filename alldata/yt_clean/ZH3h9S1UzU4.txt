The old Polynesian have seen for probably 3,000 or 4,000 years. There is something about So, yes, for me it's probably [narrator] &lt;i&gt;Moorea, an island&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;that captures the essence&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Green volcanic peaks provide an unrivalled&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;French underwater cameraman&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and two of the best free divers&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;are about to embark on their mission.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The Belgian diver Frederic Buyle&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;And the Canadian world-class&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;will work closely with Fred&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Every island in French Polynesia&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But they all have one thing in common:&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Turquoise bays conceal&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and the sea forms a major part&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Moorea is the base of the French&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;where the shark specialist Johann Mourier&lt;/i&gt; -Hi, Fred, welcome to CRIOBE. -We go? [narrator]&lt;i&gt; Johann Mourier specialises&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and uses some interesting techniques&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;that can also be used&lt;/i&gt; You also have planned to work What's the next step for you? We will go to Rangiroa this is a species that is, uh... usually found in Rangiroa, but it's very And nobody knows what they do during They might be travelling, like oceanic whitetips or something? Yeah, we only know that we can see some individuals but we don't know where they are going. So there is two kinds of techniques because we don't know what they do. We can put some acoustic tags [Frederic] For the resident sharks. ...to see if it's a resident shark. And we can also put some satellite tags. And if they emigrate, we will be able This shark, the great hammerhead, So that's why we need your help to tag it because you don't do bubbles and you will be able and it will be easier for us to tag it. I'm quite happy to be here again [narrator] &lt;i&gt;Rangiroa lies 250 kilometres&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and with its 80 kilometres length&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;it is one of the four biggest atolls&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Its name translates as &quot;endless sky,&quot;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;a reflection of its big skies&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;About 2,000 people live on the biggest&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;which is dissected by hundreds&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;This is where the ebb and flow&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;supplies a multitude of food and most&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;This will be the divers' starting point.&lt;/i&gt; Now we will attract and we'll see what happens, but we hope to see maybe So, we never know what we attract, [narrator] &lt;i&gt;The weather isn't&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Wind creates waves and difficult currents.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Clouds darken the otherwise bright&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But still, the sheer diversity&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;of the underwater world at Rangiroa&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;A massive shoal of humpback red snappers&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;is having a rest after the exertions&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;They are predators, but during the day,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;to seek protection from bigger hunters.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The reef is teeming with wildlife.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But there is no sign&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;In the wide expanse of the South Pacific,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;it's like looking for a needle&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Again and again, the free divers&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;They have to remain vigilant.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Other sharks are ready and waiting:&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;They often congregate in the channels&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Grey reef sharks are generally curious,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;And in contrast to many types of shark,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;They make a nice&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Growing to a length of about 2.5 metres,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;they can dive to an impressive depth&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;For the team, they're a good sign.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;These sharks are not just hunters,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;they're also prey,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and their predators include&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Perhaps their presence means&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;of finding their shy targets after all.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;This shark has already been a target&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Although Fred and Will are&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Their controlled movements&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;means the sharks are relaxed&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But bad weather means&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;A storm is brewing, and the expedition&lt;/i&gt; Today, not a lot of light, very rainy, That's the lagoon of Rangiroa, and you see the lagoon is like And, uh... it's bad weather. [narrator] &lt;i&gt;The boats have to be secured.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Although this is the rainy season,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;One low pressure system follows the next.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Bad underwater visibility makes the search&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;And the rough waves would make it&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;to return to the boat.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But there is a glimmer of hope.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The weather forecast for&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Perhaps they're in luck.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The weather clears up.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The team is up early to get ready&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Carefully, they load the expensive&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Their destination is&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;where a channel opens from the islands&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;It's the beginning of a long day.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The marine biologists&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;with a serious disadvantage&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;to observe the animals underwater.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Their diving equipment is noisy&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;It is disruptive and frightening&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Free divers, on the other hand,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Years of training allow them to stay&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;for minutes at a time.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;It makes them perfect&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Without any technical aids,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;they search for the shy hammerheads&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;They're not perceived as a threat.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;And here he is, the king&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;It emerges as if from nowhere...&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and quickly disappears again.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But at least the divers now know that this&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;These will serve to register signals&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;that they hope to attach to the sharks.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;They install a concrete base at a depth&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;An eagle ray approaches.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;They are one of the main prey species&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Perhaps this, too, is a good sign.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Fred also finds a hawksbill turtle nearby.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;They are now critically endangered&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Marine turtles are still hunted&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and threatened with extinction.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;They are usually very shy,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;but this one doesn't seem to feel&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;It's busily looking for food,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;mainly sponges that live&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;While the scientists install the receivers&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Fred continues his search&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But since his brief encounter,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But there are other types&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The divers have to stay alert&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The receiver is installed very carefully.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Hopefully, it'll record valuable data&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Silvertip sharks emerge&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;It's certainly a lot easier to observe&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;since they are very curious&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;They want to find out if it might be worth&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and they invest a lot of time&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Fred and Will don't take the situation&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;They make sure never to turn&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;As long as they can maintain eye contact&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and don't give the sharks a chance&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The sharks will not take the risks&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;without the element of surprise.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;While the grey reef sharks always stay&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;these bigger silvertip sharks&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The outer reef area&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;They're not known to be&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;but down here, nothing can be&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The sharks do keep a very wary eye&lt;/i&gt; [dolphins clicking, calling] &lt;i&gt;Then the divers receive other visitors.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Mammals, just like themselves.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Curious and playful&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;they come to investigate the divers.&lt;/i&gt; [dolphin vocalizations continue] &lt;i&gt;Dolphins are essentially&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;They can hold their breath&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and reach incredible depths&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The dolphins of Rangiroa have been&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;They're inquisitive and keep only&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;to the divers.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Humans have always been fascinated&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;with the dolphins' playful&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;And while many shark species&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;dolphins are very sociable animals.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;These highly developed&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;don't spend all day in pursuit of prey.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Dolphins have time to play&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;For many people they represent&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;free and full of a love for life.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;They decide how long&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Then they vanish again in the wide&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;It's been a gripping dive,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;but the mission to meet&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;was disappointing.&lt;/i&gt; At present there is lots of, uh... eagle ray in the pass. That is one of the favourite prey And maybe these sharks because they already and are not hungry yet at the moment. So we'll see to... to try again and maybe get back All the boats find tiger sharks and we find silvertips, which for me and they're cool, I like them. But they are. That one was just like a Galapagos. Coming behind and you turn around [whistles] &quot;Not me, not me.&quot; Yeah. So... Still there's a lot of life here. Oh, yeah, beautiful. Huge amounts of fish. Huge, huge, huge. So... that was a nice, nice experience. It's good to be in the water. we don t find what we need. Yep. [narrator] &lt;i&gt;Time for a well-earned rest&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;while waiting&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The South Pacific continues&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;that isn't exactly the way it's portrayed&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The divers use their free time&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;that Johann has recovered from the seabed.&lt;/i&gt; So now we have these two sharks' data. Uh... There is an interesting pattern, so that would be really interesting to tag and to see if they all we, at this point, So they seem to stay in this area and to tag both with acoustic we could gain more information Ideally, two tags on each shark Yeah. This is a satellite tag, so, on this tag we have a different sensor about the temperature, the depth of the shark and also the light. And with the light, you can, Determine the position of the shark. Yeah, determine the position And so we can, usually, we put this for different months. Like... usually it's better to, uh... to put like five or six months of data, and after you get this information [Frederic] The hammerhead is and when you find him, or I would say more you have like 30 seconds to react. Because it's a very shy animal, and... he is just doing one or two turns, and then he leaves And sometimes you wait for 2 1/2 hours to have 20 or 30 seconds So within these 30 seconds approach him without scaring him, So it's not easy, We do a lot of dives, in the same place waiting for him. And... So we are really curious to see because they are very strong swimmers so they might do thousands So it would be really cool and see where the animal went. [narrator] &lt;i&gt;But Johann has to return&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;on the next available flight.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The search for the great hammerhead sharks&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;because his ongoing lemon shark research&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Fred and Will will join him&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;but first they plan a visit&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;the Blue Lagoon.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;It is a protected area&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and plans to build hotels&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;were thankfully never put into action.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The palm trees on the beaches are home&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;It includes a number of terns&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Even the violet lorikeet,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;which has vanished from&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;still survives here.&lt;/i&gt; [chirping] &lt;i&gt;The Blue Lagoon is also a nursery&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;In this sheltered bay, they have little&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Although some adults have been&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;blacktip sharks generally&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and weigh about 18 kilos.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;There are only a few places left on Earth&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;from tourists and protected from hunters.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The Blue Lagoon of Rangiroa&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Fred and Will return to Moorea to join&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Just like the Blue Lagoon of Rangiroa,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;where young lemon sharks grow up in peace.&lt;/i&gt; Great. -OK, let's go. [narrator] &lt;i&gt;Johann puts out nets to examine&lt;/i&gt; [Will] How long will they stay in here, before they're big enough to go out Uh... we... We don't really know, but I'm sure they'll still stay I have a sample of an individual, So we sample the same individual. But I think when they are growing, they're expanding their home range, and the home range is growing, and they will go further But they still come here to protect... I think they are still coming in this area And after the first lemon sharks is about 2 metres, so I think they are using the lagoon and after they can start Outside of the reef. [Johann] Outside of the reef. [narrator] &lt;i&gt;The researchers capture&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;to study their development in detail.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The sharks' yellow or olive colouration&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;It is a kind of camouflage&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and sandy sea bottom of their home range.&lt;/i&gt; [Johann] So here we have a female. So I will just need help We have here, look, so it's a new individual, Okay. Will? Can you grab it? Be careful with your hand. Okay. Beautiful little creatures, huh? So, you wanna measure the tail? -[Johann] Yeah, the whole body. [narrator] &lt;i&gt;At birth, these sharks&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;but by the time they reach adulthood,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Adult lemon sharks may look threatening,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;but lethal attacks on humans&lt;/i&gt; [Johann] So it's 69 centimetres. Now, I will take a genetic sample. You taking it from here, from the tail? -Big mouth. Relative to their little body, yeah. Okay. Let me, uh... [Johann] Oh, it's okay, don't worry. [Johann speaking French] I put the sample in alcohol for future genetic analysis, so we extract the DNA so we can take it for a long time. -Okay, so I can let him go? [speaking French] &lt;i&gt;On y va, mon ami.&lt;/i&gt; It's beautiful. Yeah. Beautiful little creatures. Their eyes are amazing. [narrator] &lt;i&gt;Adult lemon sharks are&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The crew gets the necessary equipment&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Free divers don't need much equipment,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;but their special carbon-fibre flippers&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;with minimum effort.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;In order to tag the sharks,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Johann will have to use&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;complete with air tanks.&lt;/i&gt; Uh... For tagging I always use Uh, it's just a special shaft in the shark, uh, but otherwise this spear gun It's just the shaft that is modified. [narrator] &lt;i&gt;The team is aiming&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;surrounding the island.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The scientists want to pass&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and target a spot where they've repeatedly&lt;/i&gt; Uh, here we really have to be careful, uh, to tag the shark after he passes you, Okay, so like from the side, the backside of the shark. So when you tag it, when he will stop and the tag inside him, And if you tag it when he's facing you, he might run away and feel trapped So always have the shark so he can just run away in open water. That's very important. [narrator] &lt;i&gt;Christian Petron will follow&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;They can't afford to have any disturbance&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;It is simply too difficult&lt;/i&gt; It's much easier to tag sharks the diving tanks, and... so that they can't disturb the sharks and going closer to the sharks and tag it in a good way. And so I will show Fred and he will try to tag it. We try to tag a resident shark today. It's a resident female we are looking for. And so we hope there is [narrator] &lt;i&gt;Lemon sharks&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;They're among the biggest sharks&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The divers' work starts with trying to get&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Lemon sharks&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The only threat comes from a select few&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;or, chillingly, their own kind.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Other kinds of shark are also inquisitive&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;They are grey reef sharks&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Lemon sharks tend to hunt&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;including smaller sharks and even&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;but stingrays, crustaceans, octopus&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But although the free divers&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;the real test is to get the right angle&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Johann stays at a distance and takes&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;for his database.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Fred is a very experienced fish tagger.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;His calm patience ensures&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Only a calmly swimming shark&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Frightened animals will quickly disappear,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;or worse, aggressive animals&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Since sharkskin is unusually tough,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;the harpoon has to be fired&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;It is quite a tall order.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Again and again,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;but decide not to shoot at the last minute&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;to avoid accidentally injuring&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Johann checks the receiver.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Four years underwater is a long time.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Fred finally decides to shoot.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The transmitter is well-placed.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Johann documents the tag.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Fred has reloaded the harpoon&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;He's in luck.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;This transmitter is also secure&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;In the next few years,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;where the lemon sharks&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;if they have a preference&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;or if they spend their time&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Johann passes&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The mission is complete.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;It's been an all-around success.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;For Fred and Will,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But that will be quite a different matter&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Even just tracking these sharks&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;They return to base.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Once again, the divers have witnessed&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;that different types of shark&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;And each individual shark&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;It doesn't do them justice&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;between more or less aggressive animals.&lt;/i&gt; Here, during that trip, I can say I met the grumpy lemon shark because They're like old men. Uh... always a bit frustrated and trying to get a bite, and you never know exactly But at the end you see and, uh, beautiful creatures and fragile try to, uh, to protect. But they are very grumpy. [narrator] &lt;i&gt;The team returns&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Divers there have come across some&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;They're spotted more often at this atoll&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;probably because their main prey,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;is available in large numbers.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Johann spends the remains of the day&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Without this revolutionary technology,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;scientists would have practically&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;of underwater creatures.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Amongst other details, Johann programmes&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;at the beginning of the expedition.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;He also pre-determines the amount of time&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;before it is released.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But he remains sceptical.&lt;/i&gt; So, everything is ready [narrator] &lt;i&gt;The hope to finally get&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;of the great hammerheads depends&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But it can only serve its purpose&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;if the free divers actually manage&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Everyone is apprehensive.&lt;/i&gt; We just have to be I think it would be difficult I hope they will have [Will] We do our best. [narrator] &lt;i&gt;The job isn't any easier&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;They're not allowed to interrupt&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;yet they are out to get&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;the most sensational pictures&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;It is almost an impossible task.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;And to have any chance at all&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;the free divers need help.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The shy great hammerhead sharks&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;have an exceptionally well-developed&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;So Johann has resorted to using&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Its scent will be carried on&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The divers try to remain&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Then, in the distance,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;they spot the contours&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Fred remains motionless to see&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But the scent has also&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;one of the most dangerous sharks&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;And this one is not at all shy.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Some of the biggest sharks&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;in the immediate vicinity&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Great hammerheads tend&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;along the tropical and sub-tropical&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;A fully-grown hammerhead can reach&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and weighs up to 500 kilos.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;They're amongst the most impressive&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But science still has&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;of why these sharks&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The researchers want to find out&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;the hammerhead sharks&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Some scientists think it provides&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The shape could provide greater stability&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;during lightning-fast manoeuvres&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Hammerheads have also been observed&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;using their heads to pin rays&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The extreme width of their heads&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;could make it easier to receive&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Or perhaps the hammerheads are able&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;of their surroundings&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But all of these theories&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Gradually, the hammerhead shark&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But the tiger shark is also still nearby.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Slowly, the circles of the hammerhead&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;bringing the shark closer to the divers.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The free divers finally have the chance&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;to take some photographs&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Now they're ready for action.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Fred collects the tagging harpoon.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;A second hammerhead shows up.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;It's a great sign.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Perhaps the divers&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The animals seem to be gaining&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But to be successful&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;everything has to be just right.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;This will be far more difficult&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The best time to approach is when&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Fred approaches directly above the shark.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But the tip of the harpoon bounces off&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Will tries a different strategy.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;He stays on the seabed&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;He lies in wait like a hunter.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;And the chance arrives.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The shark passes him at close range.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But still, Will decides against a shot.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;He could easily injure the animal&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;They have to get the timing exactly right.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;And they need a double dose of luck.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Eventually success!&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The transmitter is secure.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;A hard day's work for the free divers.&lt;/i&gt; [Will] The hammerhead has very tough skin. The first shot, Fred was, for any other close enough, but it bounced off. So, then the rush was on replace the tag and then wait but... the second shot was perfect. A very difficult animal to work with. They don't come But the thing is, he's not arriving He's always, the first time, every time [Will] Yeah, they don't come from they come from with the current. Usually, every sea creature and these things are going down-current, so maybe they saw us, feel it before, [Will] I think they scent it Yeah. Usually, they just go to the source. [narrator] &lt;i&gt;The dive team&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;but this is only the beginning&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;They now have to hope that the transmitter&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;When it eventually returns&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;it will cast some light on the secret life&lt;/i&gt; [Frederic] Every time you work uh... you have to adapt, because the shark So basically the techniques are the same. I use the sinking technique or waiting technique at the bottom, but you always have to trim it, The great hammerhead is very fast, He just satisfies his curiosity Other sharks will stay there and you have a lot of time to figure out So you have to be very, very adaptive and notice that, within the hammerheads, One was more, I would say... curious about us and stayed a bit longer and came back and came back, Uh, but another one just came 30 seconds So you really have to be That's also the fun part of that job. But it's probably the most and probably one of the most to tag that hammerhead. Even though it was in not a long dive, the mind-set and all that, putting everything together. We had a lot of current that day. Uh... And also being able to have It was very difficult to put everything so it was probably one of the most &lt;i&gt;The island of Rurutu in the South Pacific.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;An exceptional team of divers&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;is about to embark on a journey&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Their aim: to study the whales&lt;/i&gt; I think free diving is a very good way &lt;i&gt;And it's probably the less invasive way&lt;/i&gt; [narrator] &lt;i&gt;In spite of their massive size,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;whales are extremely shy animals&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Most people are only ever tolerated&lt;/i&gt; [Cecile] There's still a lot to learn because we still have an estimation maybe, humpbacks but among them only a few proportion [narrator] &lt;i&gt;To explore their secret lives&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;it is essential to meet the whales&lt;/i&gt; [speaking French] [interpreter] These whales are enormous. They're not small fish. They weigh 30 tonnes. That's a bit like an approaching bus. [narrator] &lt;i&gt;Rurutu is a tiny island&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Discovered by James Cook in 1769,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Few visitors ever set foot&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;so its greatest asset&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Only seven kilometres long&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;it lies far off the main shipping routes.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But it does lie right in the path&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;the migration of the humpback whales.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;They were once hunted&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;but today, French Polynesia&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;into a unique conservation area&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Diving with conventional equipment&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;It makes it an unusually safe and peaceful&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;And this is where they come&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;in their Antarctic feeding grounds.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;It is an epic annual trip&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Although humpback whales&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;it is possible to find&lt;/i&gt; [whales calling] &lt;i&gt;It is an ideal place for a whale nursery.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The cows give birth to their calves&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Here, their young are safe&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and protected from violent storms.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;It is mid-September.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The intense tropical colours typical of&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and Rurutu is immersed in&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The weather is unusually&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;It's been raining for days.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The idea of spotting whales just off&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;These are bad conditions&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Frederic Buyle and William Winram.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Their expedition to find and catalogue&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;They're on their way to assist&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;the founder of the Polynesian&lt;/i&gt; Te Mana o Te Moana, -Hello. Hello, welcome to Polynesia. -[Fred] Beautiful weather. -Good. [laughter] [speaking French] [narrator] &lt;i&gt;The weather forecasts&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The team can only hope for the best.&lt;/i&gt; So we go tomorrow morning. The weather will turn around, -Good, great. -Cool, great. Okay. [narrator] &lt;i&gt;Finding the whales&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;is usually not a problem,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;but they need better weather&lt;/i&gt; A lot of studies have been done for the past decade and it's very interesting We know, for example, the whaling and we also know now, we've all studied that the population It started to reproduce and we hope but we are not sure, because there that maybe our hope right now is going to be really different The new kind of research going underwater with the whale and be very comfortable as a whale is going to help us having and also sharing with other people, where, if we could study wildlife we may get more information, without too much disturbance. And so we hope that this is and that it could be maybe about how humans can use this ability [narrator] &lt;i&gt;Finding a whale requires&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Since whales tend to keep&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;it means having to spot a whale's back&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Even better is to search for the &quot;blow,&quot;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;the cloud of fine spray&lt;/i&gt; Oh. Whale. Just blow behind us. [man] &lt;i&gt;La, la, la, la.&lt;/i&gt; [narrator] &lt;i&gt;But even once a whale is&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and obtaining useful images&lt;/i&gt; [speaking French] [interpreter] The first thing since it's always in motion. When it's moving, it's tough to film it. So you have to wait until it finds If you're watching a mother with her calf, Then the whale will remain calm and still Right now, that's not possible. This whale is swimming around the island. [narrator] &lt;i&gt;The search for whales&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Even once a blow has been spotted,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;will continue its travels&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;And actually getting into the water&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;is only worth it when it's certain&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The only option is to keep&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and constantly evaluate the situation.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But the team will also have to keep an eye&lt;/i&gt; The danger when you are involved it's always human. Uh, it's never the creature It's always human. And here the biggest problem is that we so you have to be very careful not to be And more on a day like that All the colours are the same underwater and you have to be very careful. So that's why we uh, in order not to be run over. [narrator] &lt;i&gt;But the whale watchers give up.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Fred and the team have more patience&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Finally, a humpback whale.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The camera team gets ready.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Diving is usually strictly prohibited&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The loud noise associated&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;agitates the animals,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and since they're supposed&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and raise their new calves,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But the free-diving team&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;to observe the whales underwater.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Free divers are different--&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Years of training allow them to spend&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;several minutes at a time&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;They are perfect underwater observers.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;They can search for the whales&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and wait patiently until an opportunity&lt;/i&gt; [whales groaning] &lt;i&gt;But the whales are very alert.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Despite the free divers' utmost care,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;they soon put an end&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The good news for the team&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;They even take the time&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;It bodes well for any future encounters.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Fred can clearly observe and document&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;the unique patterns on the whale's&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Conditions improve.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The weather gradually clears up.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But for now, the team's luck has run out&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Fred and Will decide to find out more&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;who used to hunt whales around the island.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Perhaps they can shed some light&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;They visit the caves&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and from where they would look out&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The steep cliffs provided&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;but also a good vantage point&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Calm and protected bays allowed them&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But reaching the caves&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and involves traversing difficult terrain.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The caves themselves&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Without a guide, it's easy to get lost&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;in this underground network&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The native people had vantage points&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;from where they could observe the whales.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Rurutu's hills reach almost 400 metres&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;There are no sign-posted paths up here.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Time for a rest beneath&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Even today, there are still people&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;who remember the old whaling days&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Fred has been told about Mama Pare,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;She's written a book&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Perhaps she can explain&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;after their initial brief encounter.&lt;/i&gt; [Mama Pare speaking French] [Frederic speaking French] [interpreter 1] We've been here and we still haven't come close Are there years when [speaking French] [interpreter 2] American and Japanese whalers so now we see a lot less of them Now the fishermen have to go [speaking French] But usually you still see They amuse themselves. You can watch them from the beach [speaking French] [interpreter 1] It's a disadvantage to hunt whales for years, [interpreter 2] and then the last one in 1957. [interpreter 1] You didn't catch [interpreter 2] Not a single one. [interpreter 1] Do you think [both speaking French] [interpreter 2] There are some around. A few people saw one not long ago. They told us it was [narrator] &lt;i&gt;Fred has also been told about&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and he decides to follow it up.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;It's the flowering of the &quot;whale tree.&quot;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;A fisherman takes Fred&lt;/i&gt; [speaking French] [interpreter 1] The tree is in full bloom [interpreter 2] Yes, that's when When it begins to flower, it means [interpreter 1] That's when [interpreter 2] That's right. [interpreter 1] What happens [interpreter 2] That's when [interpreter 1] So we've come [interpreter 2] Yes. [narrator] &lt;i&gt;If this bit&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;the team has come here at the right time.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But then there's another setback.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;There's been a fax from Papeete,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;It's a tsunami warning.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Nobody seems to have concrete information.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The team desperately tries&lt;/i&gt; [speaking French] [interpreter] I'm in contact with France. It's possible this is the last chance They know that we're taking all So we stay here until it arrives. I guess. See what it looks like. [narrator] &lt;i&gt;The island's shoreline&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Technical equipment is packed and everyone&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The wait begins.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The tsunami hits Samoa&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;but it doesn't reach Rurutu.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The island has a lucky escape.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;For the expedition,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;the first few days on the island&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;So when a call from Dr Michael Poole,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;reaches the dive team,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Dr Poole would be interested to meet them.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Moorea is one of the Society Islands,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Its bigger neighbour is Tahiti.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;It is located right in the heart&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;for marine mammals&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Lush vegetation and high trees&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and imposing volcanic peaks&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;It is the essence of tropical&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The bright turquoise bays&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;are lined with a protective fringe reef&lt;/i&gt; Hello, Fred. [narrator] &lt;i&gt;Dr Poole has been based here&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;He's the director of the Marine Mammal&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;at the Island Research Centre&lt;/i&gt; ...the biggest animals on the planet. [narrator] &lt;i&gt;He's one of the driving forces&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;of the whale and dolphin sanctuary.&lt;/i&gt; Every time we find an answer, there are five other questions And some basic things that we do not know: We don't know. How do they find their breeding ground? Seven thousand kilometres' distance and how do they undertake that migration? We find the same whales coming back How do they do that? Um, the song of the humpback whales. The males that sing the song, We have different hypotheses. But no one is totally sure, Why does the song change Why does the song evolve over time? And so we're searching Every week we're out, to try to find answers to these questions. Myself, my colleagues, our students, all trying to find answers We've never lost that fascination, because And another reason why you and stay long is valuable to our research is that you can photograph or the side of the individual. And with your photographs, [narrator] &lt;i&gt;Free diving&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Both fishermen and pearl divers have used&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Local knowledge is always invaluable,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and the Tahitian free diver Matana Taimana&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;On the way, she has a chance to show Fred&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;stingrays that show no fear of humans.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Christian Petron gets his equipment ready.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The stingrays are already waiting&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Due to the venomous barbs on their tails,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;they have a reputation&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;but here they're at ease&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Elegantly gliding through the water,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;the rays live up&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and don't respond nervously to the divers.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But to find humpback whales, the divers&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The tireless search&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Dr Poole doesn't usually work with divers.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;He tends to watch and identify the animals&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;using a catalogue of photographs.&lt;/i&gt; [speaking French] &lt;i&gt;La-bas.&lt;/i&gt; [Cecile] &lt;i&gt;Ooh-la-la.&lt;/i&gt; [Will] Bad angle. [narrator] &lt;i&gt;Humpback whales have&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;distinct both in shape and colouration.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Occasionally, the whales give spectacular,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;They emerge from the water and thrash&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;These may be attempts to rid themselves&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The energetic spectacle means&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;which the scientists quickly gather&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;It allows them to analyse&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Over time, they can piece together&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;of each individual.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Fred prepares for a dive.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Should a whale approach,&lt;/i&gt; [crew speaking French] &lt;i&gt;Christian is only too aware&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;to get the chance to film Fred&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;It can mean hours of waiting,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Patience is one&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;to make it as a wildlife filmmaker.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Then they're in luck: they spot&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;They seem to be resting near the surface.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;There's no time to lose.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Fred always makes&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;By the time the other divers manage&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;the whale may have already moved on.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;This time, luck is on their side.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The whale calf is not at all shy,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;while its mother is having&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;It's a one-off chance&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The divers have to be very careful:&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But this intimate meeting&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;is over all too soon.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The mother eventually intervenes&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and the two majestic&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But then Fred spots another opportunity:&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;For a few minutes,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But the pilot whales are being followed:&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;an oceanic whitetip shark&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;This is a formidable predator,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But the whales are safe in its company.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Oceanic whitetip sharks are often found&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;although the reason for this association&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;It's a breathtaking experience for Fred.&lt;/i&gt; [Fred] For a few seconds, I m really part of the environment as one of the inhabitants I try not to bring but try really to forget about them, and just being like an animal, Free diving allows you to do that. [narrator] &lt;i&gt;And as Fred becomes one&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;the animals he encounters seem&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;He can witness their behaviour&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Tracking whales is laborious&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But there are some shortcuts.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Sometimes it's possible to hear&lt;/i&gt; [whale bellowing] [grunting, squeaking] &lt;i&gt;And Fred's luck hasn't run out yet.&lt;/i&gt; [grunting, squeaking] [moaning, honking] [grunting, squeaking] [gurgling] &lt;i&gt;Photographs like these&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;They're a very welcome addition&lt;/i&gt; Maybe we can talk about this mark. [Poole] That's really pretty, Fred. I mean, from the aesthetic viewpoint, Nice marks. Yes. And look how Can you go backwards just a second? Right here, splitting into two. Allowing more spread, more expansion Very, very nice. [narrator] &lt;i&gt;These detailed photographs&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;are invaluable to Dr Poole's research.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Working from the boat,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;to take any pictures as detailed as these.&lt;/i&gt; [Poole] We can actually identify whales, not only by their dorsal fins. We can identify them by their pleats. They're different for every individual. Great photograph, Fred. [narrator] &lt;i&gt;But Fred soon&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;to continue his original mission.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;It isn't looking positive.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Will has told him that the team still&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;This is highly unusual&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Normally, there are always&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Could there be a connection&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;or the tsunami?&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Not a blow anywhere to be seen.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;A frustrating wait for the divers.&lt;/i&gt; [Will] Nothing yet. In the past they had sometimes periods because they go to other islands. Okay. So, hopefully it's the case but still it's apparently like eight days We have to keep our fingers crossed [narrator] &lt;i&gt;Fred tries to stay optimistic.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;He knows only too well&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;to a mission like Cecile's.&lt;/i&gt; The best example of the difference is that, for example, in many places it's forbidden to scuba dive with sharks, or even reefs. And the scientists understood Most of the time free diving is allowed. For example, here in Rurutu But you can free dive. With free diving, you don't But of course with free diving It doesn't mean you're just part But the general disturbance But you still have to be careful to approach them from front, Otherwise they feel you and go away. And try always to be It's not because you are a free diver and do whatever you want. You still have to keep and the way you work with animals. It's not, uh... I would say a general visa, You still have to be careful. [narrator] &lt;i&gt;The team continues&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Again, the boat is loaded&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;They're committed to their mission.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But for Cecile, too, time is running out.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;She's expected back on Moorea.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;So Christian wants to try a different&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;He has a special hydrophone,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Encased in a watertight housing,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;registers soundwaves underwater&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Christian's plan is to listen for signs&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;And if you can hear a whale,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Today, conditions at least&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The visibility is good and the sea&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Fred and Will get into position&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Christian lets the hydrophone drift&lt;/i&gt; [whale calling] &lt;i&gt;And the tactic seems to be working:&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;And these are special.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The problem is to work out the direction&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Finally, success!&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;They've come across a singer.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Whales take up a particular position&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;They remain motionless&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;head down and fins outstretched.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Underwater, it's actually possible&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The exact method of generating&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Unlike land animals, the whales&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;It's possible they manage to recycle air&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;to continue their songs&lt;/i&gt; [trilling, whooping] &lt;i&gt;For the divers, this encounter&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;was a first real success&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;They return to dry land and prepare&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;with precious underwater images as well as&lt;/i&gt; [indistinct conversation] &lt;i&gt;Male humpback whales sing&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;It's possible they're trying to attract&lt;/i&gt; [whale singing] &lt;i&gt;But their songs could also serve&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Studies have shown&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;have their own distinct songs.&lt;/i&gt; Arriving very slowly, slowly, slowly... [whale singing] [narrator] &lt;i&gt;The tunes the males produce&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and travel for hundreds&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The different sounds combine&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;which are repeated in a particular order&lt;/i&gt; [singing continues] &lt;i&gt;Cecile explains to Fred&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;in more information about the whales.&lt;/i&gt; What is your hope for the future? So I think even if we feel there's been we still need to do more So I think whales and if really there is a message that whales are still threatened even if it's not hunting, then we hope that these people We also found that when people they feel they know this animal better, they feel it different way, and when &quot;Okay, now maybe I'm going [narrator] &lt;i&gt;The divers are eager&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But they don't get very far.&lt;/i&gt; [crew member shouts] &lt;i&gt;Without engine power,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and threatens to run aground on the reef.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;They have to abandon their whale search&lt;/i&gt; [speaking French] [narrator] &lt;i&gt;The priority now&lt;/i&gt; [speaking French] Can you use that, please? [man speaking French] [narrator] &lt;i&gt;They've been lucky to escape&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;but it's a further disappointment,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;for today, they're unable&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Fred and Will try&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and visit the next village&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Around lunchtime, after school,&lt;/i&gt; [drumming] [Fred] The people are You see, it's a very small island When you're walking the street, Everybody is really friendly, They give you fruit from the garden. You can ask them to pick up fruit People are so friendly. [narrator] &lt;i&gt;Rurutu doesn't have&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The villages are not packed&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But customs have to be kept alive&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;which are one of the main forms&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But there are one or two surprises&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Rurutu also has French roots after all.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The divers need to have&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and they've found&lt;/i&gt; I did not expect to find this It's French Polynesia, -Oh! Wow. [narrator] &lt;i&gt;While their boat&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;they can only wait and watch while others&lt;/i&gt; [children laughing] [squealing] [man speaking French] [narrator] &lt;i&gt;A new day brings fresh hope.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But although the sun's out,&lt;/i&gt; [man speaking French] &lt;i&gt;The divers want to reach the open sea&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;through a pass&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;There are only a handful&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Things aren't going to plan.&lt;/i&gt; [speaking French] With the condition today, the boat can pick you up -No, no, no. It's way too rough. [man speaking French] [interpreter] For us conventional divers, We can dive under them, because they get overrun by the waves [narrator] &lt;i&gt;Even the stunning&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The divers are again forced to wait&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Eventually, they're able&lt;/i&gt; [Will] Whale. Whale! [narrator] &lt;i&gt;This time,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Now they have to follow the whales.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;A last equipment check.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;They've managed to find&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;They're an ideal target for the divers,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;since the pair will definitely have&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The divers continuously check&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;They don't want to take any chances&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;of a close encounter&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Finally, things seem to be&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;They can risk approaching the animals&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The whale mother remains motionless&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Floating upright in the water column,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;she keeps an eye on her baby.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The calf is very curious,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Although still a baby, it is already&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;It seems curious about&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;into its underwater world&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;On this occasion, Fred has enough time&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and catalogue its distinctive marks&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;It's a unique and rare opportunity&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;on their own terms&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;before, finally, it's time&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;This mission turned out to be no easy task&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But despite all the setbacks,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;they've been successful in delivering&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;of the Rurutu whales.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;They will provide valuable information&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;for the researchers.&lt;/i&gt; These are the pictures I took The calf was very playful because it was like a little kid, It didn't know where to put its fins, [Cecile] So you have a very good So this is a very distinctive mark that Uh, did you get an estimation of the size? [Fred] The size, I think It was young, but maybe one, -Was just not a newborn. So you know this is very important are so distinctive and so impressive, So this animal, if it's seen in a month, maybe forty years, you can tell this in Rurutu this year. [Fred] Maybe during I might bump into that whale again? Exactly. So this is how it's very but tourists and any people who have to be able to download these pictures and any specific mark like that, they should be labelled Yes. I'm always happy when for something else Uh, if it can help and improve the knowledge about these animals, [Cecile] It's great. It's a great picture, That was really fascinating, I've never seen that before. [narrator] &lt;i&gt;Part of the fascination people&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;must surely also lie with their exotic&lt;/i&gt; [Fred] What we find here it's the Pacific Islands 150 years ago. For me, the humpback whales because every year they do thousands to go from their feeding grounds back here in the South Pacific islands and then go all the way back in the feeding ground of Antarctica. And that's a mystery, because they do this It's fascinating to watch them, Um... it's also awe-inspiring When you're next to [Fred] Sometimes when I'm free diving when they sleep, they lay at 25 metres. I look at the whale and I say, &quot;Yeah, that's a wonderful life.&quot; It's whale therapy. -Yeah. -It's true. It's true. I mean, all your problems disappear Because it's so big, it's there for like It's just a perfect creature. And peaceful. And after spending time with them, For sure, you change. By themselves they can They can really do that. &lt;i&gt;Free diver Frederic Buyle&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;For thousands of years,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and turned into a veritable cesspool&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Now he wants to take stock.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;What condition will he find&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;And how have people changed&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;His extraordinary free-diving abilities,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and not least his courage,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;of his underwater surroundings.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;He manages to uncover spectacular secrets&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Only a diver that behaves like a fish&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;His noiseless and extremely flexible&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;allows him to investigate places&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;that remain out of reach&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;He can experience this world in a new way.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;He's searching for traces&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;that the Mediterranean used to be.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Fifty kilometres off the French coastline&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;ready to begin a three-week expedition&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The Mediterranean has a surface area&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and is among the most ravaged&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;On board, an unusual team,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;It includes a renowned&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and two of the best free divers&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Christian Petron has a wealth&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;including Luc Besson's&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The Belgian Frederic Buyle,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;that has now devoted himself&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;His security diver is the record-breaking&lt;/i&gt; So, I heard from a lot of people And, you know, I've only dove a few other places so don't know what to expect. You'll be surprised. With Christian, we're going to show you and it will change your idea -[Will] Really? [Will] I look forward to it. [narrator] &lt;i&gt;Finally,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;They're heading east&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and the wreck of the Donator,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;that hit a mine after the end&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Wrecks have always been&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;not least because of the sense of mystery&lt;/i&gt; For me, that kind of dive It's what I like to do in free diving with current, no visibility, no line to guide you, Somehow it's a sixth sense because you don't know You feel maybe the big metallic mass I think that's the essence [Christian] Okay. This morning, we look for diving It's a wreck sinking during the... just after the World War II. A very, very nice wreck. We have to do a good diving plan. William and I will be able Also, on the wreck, there is a lot of chance with dentex, bream, and stuff. So we have to be very silent not to scare them away. If they are there, We will see a lot of fish. The problem, between these two islands, which means That's why it's a rich wreck, Okay? Let's go. [narrator] &lt;i&gt;From their base&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;the team approaches&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;with a more versatile Zodiac.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The weather looks promising,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;of the conditions&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Currents, visibility,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;For dives like this one&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;everything has to be just right, no matter&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The remains of this dead ship&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;It seems nature has conquered&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and turned it into a true paradise.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The colours revealed&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;And although the colour red&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;it is there, spectacularly exposed&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;This dive is a serious challenge&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Just to get here and back, they have to&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Once at the wreck, they have to be careful&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;to avoid a potential blackout&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Reefs are like underwater islands&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;They offer shelter and food for all kinds&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;And while the wreck of the Donator&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;it has been here for over 60 years,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;allowing masses of organisms&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;turning it into a true underwater city.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The wreck attracts divers in droves.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;On resurfacing, Fred and Will&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;not to be hit by the numerous boats.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;A collision with a ship's propeller&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;-Bonne journee.&lt;/i&gt; [narrator] &lt;i&gt;Underwater,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;until the scuba divers arrive.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Everything changes dramatically.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The exhaled bubbles from all these divers&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Mud is whirled up from the seabed.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;For Fred, there is nothing left&lt;/i&gt; It's really interesting. When we arrived, our first two dives, at 20 metres you could see Now... with all the movement on it, at 20 it's barely visible. It's the &lt;i&gt;Muppet Show&lt;/i&gt; down there. Have already 110 divers. With that boat arriving, it will be It's just crazy. [man] &lt;i&gt;Allez!&lt;/i&gt; [crew speaking French] [narrator] &lt;i&gt;It's time for the divers&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;For Christian Petron, this expedition&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Twenty-five years ago, he already&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;of the French Mediterranean to raise&lt;/i&gt; [speaking French] [interpreter] These are the pictures in front of Marseilles. There was absolutely no treatment No, nothing was treated. This was practically the toilet It all went directly into the sea. It was a real cesspool. We went diving here to show Everything was dead here. The fish, all dead. It was a disaster. [narrator] &lt;i&gt;Shocking pictures like these&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;for one of the most progressive&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;in the Mediterranean:&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;a massive artificial reef&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Sandrine Ruitton from&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;is the scientific leader of the project.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;She takes Fred out to the reef.&lt;/i&gt; [Sandrine] &lt;i&gt;Vas-y.&lt;/i&gt; [narrator] &lt;i&gt;This project could be compared&lt;/i&gt; [Sandrine speaking French] [interpreter] The is the map That's interesting because we've built which benefit from each other, The inside of the artificial reef They allow a complex structure for different species. [narrator] &lt;i&gt;The buoy is there&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;From the surface,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;this new-built estate&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;It lies at a depth of around&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Hobby divers and fishermen&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Disturbances are to be kept to a minimum.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But the free divers' sensitive&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Fred approaches&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;He's concerned not to scare&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But visibility is very poor&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;He is completely noiseless.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;It's his only chance to catch&lt;/i&gt; [Fred speaking French] [interpreter 1] I dived from below Above it, I saw a few sea bream there. [Sandrine speaking French] [interpreter 2] Oh, that's interesting. That's an important fish. Um, and you've surely seen [Fred speaking French] [interpreter 1] Yep, yeah, that's right, [narrator] &lt;i&gt;Sandrine takes pictures&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;that have begun to settle here.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Algae and invertebrates&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and form the basis of a new food chain.&lt;/i&gt; Yeah, interesting. It's a big structure and a lot of fish And... the fish noticed my presence, and then when I started they went slowly in open water. But it's interesting to see it works, that structure really works It's very interesting. [narrator] &lt;i&gt;The developments&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;A mass of factors influence the success&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Currents, depth, and the structure&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But the divers don't just find signs&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Sandrine also finds a fishing net&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;It is a definite sign that fishermen&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Artificial reefs are only part&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;back to the coastal waters&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The most important step was to build&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;to restore the water quality sufficiently&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Sandrine shows Fred the progress made&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Some fish are beginning to return.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;They in turn will provide food&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;And the project's success will be directly&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The small fishermen of Marseilles&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;will once again be able to make&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;It will take decades for the sea&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;but there is now a glimmer of hope.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The expedition's&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;This is an exceptional&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The visibility of the water is famous,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and there are more than just shipwrecks&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Just outside the town of Calvi,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Unlike the wreck of the Donator,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Perhaps it's simply too small&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Not far away lies&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;where Fred has been given&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;For all other divers,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The sheer diversity of life here&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But Scandola is home to some exceptional&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Huge rock outcrops have created&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;complete with canyons&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;that provide secure living quarters&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;And that applies not only to fish,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;but also a completely&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;the rare red corals of the Mediterranean.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Red corals are strictly protected here.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;They've been popular assets&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;but over time,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;has reduced their numbers greatly.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But the beauty of these corals&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Once turned into jewellery,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;nothing is left&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;that once lived&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Occasionally, there are also&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The hordes of hobby divers found&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;would be a disaster&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;It would spell the end&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But long-term observations have shown&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;that these coral colonies&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Harvesting corals has been&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But these days only a handful&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;are still allowed to harvest them&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;In Bonifacio in the south of Corsica,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;one of the last men to make his living&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;He's not only a diver, but also crafts&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The &lt;/i&gt;corailleur &lt;i&gt;has become&lt;/i&gt; [speaking French] [narrator] &lt;i&gt;Jean-Philippe&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;along the coast of Bonifacio&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;While Fred dives&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;just like the coral divers of the past,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;modern scuba-diving equipment&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But despite this, being a coral diver&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The long dives at considerable depths&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;have cost many a coral collector&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Jean-Philippe collects the corals by hand,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and only as many&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;One of the reasons why corals&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;is that their growth rates&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;only a few millimetres every year.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;So it takes decades for the tiny polyps&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;to build up a structure&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Collecting them is back-breaking work.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The &lt;/i&gt;corailleur &lt;i&gt;has to leave&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;to allow them sufficient time&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;To follow Jean-Philippe,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;There are hardly any corals left&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The industrial harvest of corals&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;involves nets that are dragged&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and destroy large areas&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;It is now strictly prohibited&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;There is hope that over time,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;these protective measures&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But the successful search for corals&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;is only the beginning&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Even today, the most beautiful corals&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;still come from the Mediterranean.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;While most other types of corals&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;because they're too brittle,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;the Mediterranean coral has&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;hard calcareous exoskeleton&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Legend has it that the corals were made&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;when Perseus cut off her head.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Today, their colour only serves&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;of the red corals&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Back at the coast&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Fred visits one of the oldest nature&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;It is under constant observation from&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Port-Cros was turned into&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;It was the first national park in Europe&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The island is surrounded&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;which includes a number of smaller islets.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Once in private ownership, the island&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;by its former owners,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;under the provision that&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;would be preserved&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Fred meets the representative&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Nicolas Gerardin.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;He's particularly proud that&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;in this protected area&lt;/i&gt; [Nicolas] The increase are very significant because we were in&lt;i&gt; l'ilot de la Gabiniere &lt;/i&gt;in 1985, and now we are about 200 And altogether it's between 500 and 600 1985, we had something like 40 groupers, and about 1,200 dive every year. If you compare 1,200 dive, towards 40 groupers, they might get mad in a few months, because no one ever could stand The other problem was that it's easier to make to make him come towards you The groupers love boiled eggs. Forty groupers, 1,200 boiled eggs. They might be sick in a few weeks So we had to avoid the people that they wouldn't bring because apart from the fish, and not interfere with it. I think the National Park of Port-Clos to use free divers for scientific work. The apnoea is the best way. It's the most natural way the most silent way, without any noise in the water, but also any noise outside, and all the logistics which is behind. [narrator] &lt;i&gt;The waters of Port-Cros&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;that to dive here&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;requires a special permission&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;It is only granted&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;To conduct population surveys&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;the rangers tend to work together&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;It means minimum disturbance&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Since the fish are curious&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;they make an easy target for hunters.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;And although population numbers&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;in these protected waters have increased&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;they are still an endangered species.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Only during the mating season&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and see anything and anyone&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Under the water's surface,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;the visitor is confronted&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Rocky mountains are dissected&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;covered with seagrass.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The seagrass meadows are home&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;to an astonishing array&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and their dense roots&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But this delicate carpet is easily damaged&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;And since seagrass grows&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;entire underwater meadows can be&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;threatening the survival&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;It's a tranquil underwater oasis&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But there is a completely different&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;one hidden from view.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Fred and Will prepare to meet&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;a journey into the deep,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;with no easy escape&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Caves.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Dark, hidden, and mysterious.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;This is a world that puts high demands&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The entrance alone lies&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;It harbours a bizarre spectacle.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Stalactites and stalagmites&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;when this cave lay suspended&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But what happens&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;It is impossible to resurface&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But there is a secret air-filled chamber.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Since the oxygen content&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;they have to use it with care.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The divers cannot afford to waste&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;They will need it for the return journey.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Nevertheless, the divers can go&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;For the flexible free divers,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;But a diver with air tanks&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The cumbersome equipment could&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The divers find no signs of life&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Time to make the journey back&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;To survive such a dangerous adventure&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;self-control, and fitness.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;It is nothing for the faint-hearted.&lt;/i&gt; [speaking French] [narrator] &lt;i&gt;Fred describes&lt;/i&gt; [Christian speaking French] [Fred speaking French] [interpreter] This cave was really Even the journey It's superb, [Christian speaking French] [interpreter] Yes, you were gone from the moment you started your dive. From the boat, and then you didn't resurface [Fred speaking French] [interpreter] We had to be careful. It was a little dicey getting through But it was an amazing experience. These stalactites and stalagmites was above the waterline The sea level was about All of these caves including the famous Cosquer cave now have an underwater entrance. But now they're slowly back If you're interested, who's a cave specialist. We could visit him. I think he'd be very interested because they have trouble trying [speaking French] So he works on the fauna of these caves. They have to dive with air tanks, which can destroy We can go talk to him. Yes, good idea. I'd be really keen [narrator] &lt;i&gt;So the Garlaban&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;At the university's institute&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;some sponge organisms found in the caves&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;have attracted a lot of attention&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;It is thought that the sponges produce&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;in the treatment of illnesses&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Fred is on his way to find out more.&lt;/i&gt; -[knock on door] &lt;i&gt;-Bonjour.&lt;/i&gt; -I'm fine. Yesterday we dove in the Capri cave. It was wonderful. I love to dive with And now I would like to know in the underwater cave So, I bet there is other form of life Yes, and you know there are There are big caves and small caves. And this one is one And you have also some other caves which is going down slope And you will notice if you go there that the waters are actually colder because the cold water is denser so it stays in the lower parts And these caves are very interesting You know, in a cave you have no light. You have almost no currents. And therefore you have to the animals living in there. And, um, we don't have all the... you know, very often, the occasion so this is an opportunity to put our tanks and study animals that otherwise or robots. So, can you actually stay and long enough to get to collect some samples, maybe? This is interesting because in this cave, we have a problem with our own bubbles We actually generate big bubbles And it is disturbing I told you, in caves, And those bubbles are actually So they are disturbing the very fragile And furthermore, there... living on the walls of the cave, they can be detached just mechanically. They can be detached And so maybe it's an interesting thing if you can go out very smoothly without disturbing the environment. That would be interesting for us. I'm going diving in the cave tomorrow, Well, unfortunately, but I suggest I send my assistant Lydia. Can you come? And she can come with you. She can go with you on the boat, and then she will take care of the samples -Okay. bring them back to the lab. Okay, wonderful. [narrator] &lt;i&gt;The Bay of La Ciotat.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;This is the location of the cave.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Now it's essential to have&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;It could be a matter of survival.&lt;/i&gt; So, like we say, Will, So you can film and put more light, because otherwise -I'll be slightly to your left and behind. We watch each other, okay? Signal me if you run out of air. I signal you also, so we, you know, Okay? On the way up, -It should be okay. And Christian's gonna... -I stay outside the cave. And checking your time. Okay. So if there is a problem, I'm ready to go in the cave, Inside the cave. Yeah, but we will need -[Christian clears throat] -Okay. Total dive from surface to surface Maximum. But we try to keep it but not more than 3 minutes, huh? -After two minutes, I come in the cave. Most important point of the dive We go too low, we stir up We go too high, So I'll try and keep the light so I can film you, so you can see clearly what you need to Okay. [narrator] &lt;i&gt;Christian thinks&lt;/i&gt; [speaking French] [interpreter] I still think But it's well organised, aware of the dangers involved, But for amateurs, it would be impossible. After all, the cave entrance alone Then he has to cover And once in the cavern, So he'll have to collect and then make the 50-metres journey back. That's about 140 metres, all told. One hundred metres of that, If he stays down I'll go into the cave [narrator] &lt;i&gt;But Fred and Will&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and go ahead with the dive.&lt;/i&gt; Okay, Christian. Our dive will be maximum three minutes. Okay, but don't stay more than [Fred] We'll try to do it, try to get I'll stay outside the cave. And I'm checking the time, -We'll try to do as fast as we can. [narrator] &lt;i&gt;It's a relief for the crew&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;-Voila.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;-Bon, c'est bon.&lt;/i&gt; Thanks, Fred. [narrator] &lt;i&gt;The assignment is complete.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Soon, these small bits of rocks&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;will be examined&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Fred doesn't show any signs of exhaustion&lt;/i&gt; -[Fred sighs] -[interpreter 1] How was it? -[interpreter 2] Everything's fine. [interpreter 2] It might have been [interpreter 1] How far was it? [interpreter 2] Ah, there's Christian! Yes, but you did give me You were in too long. -It takes its time. I dove down to the centre and took the sample. I was really stressed But then I could see you. I was just about to go in myself. Really? Okay, it's done. We have the sponge. [narrator] &lt;i&gt;But the sponges cannot survive&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The team makes their way&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;There is hope for the damaged waters&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;On their journey, Fred and Will have found&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;places where a surprising diversity&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and the efforts of people&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;and nurture life back are encouraging.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Perhaps the Mediterranean will once again&lt;/i&gt; What do you think after this trip, Will, Completely changed my opinion. I'm really surprised. There's a lot of fish, One of the, I'd say in the top five -Really? Yeah, it was incredible. What was really impressive The bottom contours, the rock formations, the different wrecks. I told you, it can be surprising. Very. [chuckles]
