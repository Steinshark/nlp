CLOSED CAPTIONING PROVIDED &gt;&gt; SET TO GO IN NASHVILLE. A BEAUTIFUL FALL DAY. TEMPERATURE AT 68 DEGREES. NOW, THE WIND COULD PICK UP THROUGHOUT THE AFTERNOON. RIGHT NOW AT 13 MILES AN HOUR. MIKE PETTINE IN HIS FIRST YEAR AT THE BROWNS HEAD COACH. HE HAD A BYE LAST WEEK. ACTUALLY GOT TO SEE HIS DAUGHTER MEGAN PLAY A LILA CROSS. SHE'S A RED SHIRT FRESHMAN ON THE STONY BROOK LACROSSE TEAM. HE SAID FRIDAY IF THE TITANS WON THE TOSS, HE WANTED TO TAKE THE BALL. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED. TENNESSEE HAS NOT SCORED A POINT IN THE FIRST QUARTER THIS YEAR. THEY'VE BEEN OUTSCORED 27-0 IN THE OPENING QUARTERS THIS YEAR. SO THEY WILL TAKE THE BALL. LEON WASHINGTON IS BACK DEEP. AND CUNDIFF WILL KICK IT AWAY FOR THE BROWNS. WEEK FIVE OF THE NFL ON CBS IS UNDERWAY. &gt;&gt; WASHINGTON WILL TAKE THIS ONE OUT. AND HE IS TRIPPED UP AT THE 14 YARD LINE. SPECIAL TEAMS TACKLE MADE BY THE ROOKIE, CHRIS KURTSEY. LOCKER DID NOT PLAY LAST WEEK BECAUSE OF THE WRIST INJURIES. LOCKER PRACTICED ALL WEEK. HE SAID HE FELT BETTER. TRIED TO PLAY ACTUALLY LAST WEEK AGAINST THE COLTS. HE TRIED TO CONVINCE WHISENHUNT HE WAS READY. BUT WHISENHUNT DECIDED TO GO WITH CHARLIE WHITEHURST. &gt;&gt; HE ASKED TO PLAY AND WAS DENIED. CRAIG STEVENS, THE TIGHT END IN MONTH. &gt;&gt; AND HE THROWS TO THE OTHER TIGHT END, DELANIE WALKER. &gt;&gt; TAKE A LOOK AT THE TENNESSEE OFFENSE. LEVITRE HAS SAID HE HAS TO PLAY BETTER. AND SHONN GREENE, THE RUNNING BACK. &gt;&gt; SHONN GREENE HAS TO STEP UP. 33 CARRIES ON THE YEAR. THEY HAVE TO GET THE RUNNING GAME GOING TO TAKE THE PRESSURE OFF OF JAKE LOCKER. &gt;&gt; 21-YARD PICK UP ON FIRST DOWN. THEY GIVE IT TO SANKEY. NOW WE HAVE A CHANCE TO LOOK AT THE BROWNS DEFENSE. TAYLOR, THE NUMBER 1 PICK IN 2011. NOW IN HIS FOURTH CAREER AT LINEBACKER. AND MINGO HAS TWO SACKS THIS YEAR. &gt;&gt; HE'S A PLAYMAKER AND A BALL HOG. TRYING TO GET ANOTHER TURNOVER FOR THE BROWNS. &gt;&gt; SECOND AND 9. OUR FIRST FLAG OF THE DAY. &gt;&gt; A LATE FLAG IN THE SECONDARY. NOW HE'S THROWING IT TOWARDS THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE AGAIN. THERE YOU CAN SEE -- HE DROPPED IT RIGHT AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. &gt;&gt; HOLDING, OFFENSE. TEN YARD PENALTY. REPLAY SECOND DOWN. &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S ON DELANIE WALKER. YOU CAN'T FAULT HIM FOR THE EFFORT. AS SOON AS THE HANDS LEAVE THE FRAME WORK OF THE BODY, IF THEY GET ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE PADS, THEY'LL THROW THE FLAG EVERY TIME. &gt;&gt; THAT BRINGS UP THIRD AND 17. THE TITANS HAVE NOT CONVERTED A THIRD AND 10 OR MORE ON THE ENTIRE SEASON. NOW THEY'RE 0 FOR 15 IN THAT CATEGORY. &gt;&gt; THAT WAS A REPEAT SECOND DOWN AFTER THE HOLDING PENALTY. YOU WON'T RUN THAT PLAY ON A THIRD AND 17. BUT NOW THEY DO FACE THAT. &gt;&gt; YOU MIGHT IF YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT YOUR QUARTERBACK. YOU MIGHT THROW A SAFE PASS BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT SOMETHING BAD TO HAPPEN EARLY IN THE BALL GAME. &gt;&gt; SO NOW IT'S THIRD AND 17. LOCKER OUT OF THE SHOTGUN. MOVEMENT ON THE LINE. A FALSE START. &gt;&gt; FALSE START, OFFENSE, NUMBER 70. FIVE-YARD PENALTY. THIRD DOWN. &gt;&gt; WHAT THE DID STEVE BEUERLEIN? &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE WORST TIME ON THIRD DOWN. BUT IT'S DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE FACT THAT YOU'RE GETTING YOURSELF IN THIRD AND LONG SITUATIONS. YOU KNOW, THEY'RE 1 FOR THE LAST 19 THIRD DOWN CONVERSIONS. IT'S BEEN A TERRIBLE DISPLAY OF HOW TO CONVERT ON THIRD DOWN. &gt;&gt; THIRD AND 22. LOCKER HAS SOME TIME. THROWS. THE PASS IS CAUGHT BY NATE WASHINGTON. BUT HE'S WELL SHORT OF THE FIRST DOWN. AND TENNESSEE WILL HAVE TO PUNT. &gt;&gt; AFTER A PROMISING START TO DELANIE WALKER ON THE NEAR SIDE, THEY GOT A NICE GAIN ON THE FIRST PLAY OF THAT DRIVE. THEN WE GOT A CHANCE TO SEE WHY THE TITANS ARE NOT SCORING POINTS IN THE FIRST QUARTER. &gt;&gt; YOU ALSO LOOK RIGHT THERE AS A SPECIAL TEAMS GUY, YOU KNOW HOW SIGNIFICANT THAT 15-YARD GAIN WAS. FIELD POSITION, GETTING THE BALL TO THE 40 YARD LINE. NOW YOUR PUNTER HAS A CHANCE TO PIN BACK THE BROWNS OFFENSE TO START THE GAME. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT TRAVIS BENJAMIN. THIS IS JORDAN HOYER WAITING FOR THE PUNT. AT THE 6 YARD LINE. NOT MUCH DOING. A GREAT PUNT BY BRETT KERN &gt;&gt; CLEVELAND NATIVE, BRIAN HOYER ON THE FIELD FOR THE BROWNS. THREE TOUCHDOWNS, NO INTERCEPTIONS. CLEVELAND THE ONLY TEAM IN THE NFL NOT TURNING THE FOOTBALL OVER. THEY HAVE POOR FIELD POSITION AFTER THE BEAUTIFUL PUNT BY KERN. FIRST AND 10 FROM THE 6. HOYER PICKS UP A SCREEN TO TATE. AND CASEY AND WEMBLEY MAKE THE TACKLE. WE LOOK AT THE CLEVELAND OFFENSE. THE ROOKIE LEFT GUARD OFF TO A NICE START. AND ANDREW HAWKINS IS BECOMING HOYER'S FAVORITE TARGET, STEVE. &gt;&gt; YEAH. HE HAD THREE YEARS IN CINCINNATI. HE COMES OVER TO TENNESSEE. VERY SMALL IN STATURE BUT HE HAS 51 CAREER RECEPTIONS FOR 500 YARDS. HE'S A SPECIAL PLAYER IF THEY CAN GET HIM THE BALL IN SPACE. &gt;&gt; BEN TATE ON SECOND DOWN. HE HAS A LITTLE ROOM. BEN TATE FOR THE FIRST DOWN. A BIG RUN BY TATE OF 15 YARDS. GIVES THE BROWNS A LITTLE BREATHING ROOM. TAKE A LOOK AT THE TENNESSEE DEFENSE. WE MET WITH CASEY. MORGAN MAKING THE SWITCH TO LINEBACKER. OFF TO A SLOW START. NO SACKS FOR MORGAN. AND COTY SENSABAUGH STARTS IN THE SECONDARY FOR RAY WILSON. &gt;&gt; COTY IS MORE CONSERVATIVE. WON'T GIVE UP THE BIG PLAY. &gt;&gt; AND TATE UP TO THE 25 YARD LINE. IT'S BEEN ALL BEN TATE SO FAR AS HE MISSED THE LAST 2 1/2 GAMES WITH THE SPRAINED RIGHT KNEE. &gt;&gt; TALK ABOUT A GUY LIKE BEN TATE AS HE TROTS OFF THE FIELD. HE'S BEING REPLACED BY ONE OF THOSE GUYS THAT FILLED IN SO WELL. ISAIAH CROWELL. THE BROWNS HAVE A BIG LINE. THEY USE IT IN EVERY ASPECT OF THEIR GAME. &gt;&gt; THEY PITCH IT TO CROWELL. HE CAN'T GET TO THE OUTSIDE. ROPATI PITOITUA MAKING THE TACKLE. DIDN'T PLAY LAST WEEK BECAUSE OF A KNEE INJURY. BACK OUT THERE TODAY FOR THE TITANS. &gt;&gt; AND YOU TALK ABOUT BEN TATE HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO GET HIM OFF TO A BIG START. HE HAD SIX CARRIES PRIOR TO THIS GAME WITH THE KNEE INJURY. IT'S BEEN GREAT FOR THE CLEVELAND BROWNS OFFENSE. YOU GET A CHANCE TO LOOK AT YOUR ROOKIES. THEY HAVE STEPPED UP AND SHOWS MIKE PETTINE THAT THEY'RE GUYS TO COUNT ON IN THE FUTURE. &gt;&gt; THIRD AND 4. BROWNS 36% ON THIRD DOWN THIS YEAR. THAT'S 26th IN THE NFL. HOYER IN TROUBLE. AND HE'S SACKED. IT WAS THE SAFETY, MICHAEL GRIFFIN COMING UP TO MAKE HIS FIRST SACK OF THE SEASON. &gt;&gt; THIS HAPPENED REALLY FAST AND CAME IN OUT OF THE SECONDARY. THE POCKET COLLAPSED. HOYER LOOKS RIGHT. HE SEES IT. HE TRIES TO GO BACK LEFT. GRIFFIN IS IN HIS FACE AS SOON AS HE TRIES TO HOT READ. &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE TO PUT THAT ON HOYER. IT'S OBVIOUS THAT NOBODY WAS ACCOUNTING FOR MICHAEL GRIFFIN. IT'S A HOT ROUTE. YOU HAVE TO GET RID OF IT. &gt;&gt; FIRST ACTION INTO WEEK TWO FOR THE TITANS. AND Mc &gt;&gt; BACK IN NASHVILLE. 8:37 TO GO. FIRST QUARTER BETWEEN THE BROWNS AND THE TITANS. GOOD FIELD POSITION FOR TENNESSEE TO START THIS DRIVE. McCLUSTER RUNS INTO HIS OWN MAN. SPUN DOWN BY PHIL TAYLOR. &gt;&gt; I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR KEN WHISENHUNT TO ESTABLISH McCLUSTER AS A PART OF THIS OFFENSE. HE'S A UNIQUE ABILITY GUY. YOU HAVE TO FIND CREATIVE WAYS OF GETTING HIM THE BALL. I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO SINCE HIM PLAY SINCE HE PLAYED FOR OLE MISS. THERE'S NOBODY HARDER TO BRING DOWN. &gt;&gt; A LOT OF SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THESE TWO TEAMS. DEVIN McCLUSTER IS THE CLEVELAND BROWNS ANDREW HAWKINS. BOTH OF THESE TEAMS HAVE THAT KIND OF GUY. THEY NEED TO FIT THEM IN THE OFFENSE. &gt;&gt; PLAY ACTION. LOCKER. HAS SOME ROOM TO RUN TO THE HEIGHT. PUMP FAKE. CUTS IT BACK INSIDE. THAT'S WHAT JAKE LOCKER BRINGS TO THE TABLE. HE FIGHTS THE FOOTBALL TO THE GROUND. AN INJURED MEMBER OF THE TITANS ON THE FIELD. BILLY WINN MAKES THE TACKLE. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN LOCKER RUNS, HE'S NOT LOOKING TO THROW. HE'S LOOKING TO RUN. LOCKER ON THAT PLAY SHOWED EXACTLY THAT. WHEN HE DECIDED TO BREAK CONTAIN, HE KEPT SOME OF IT. HE WANTED TO TUCK THE FOOTBALL AND GET THE FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; THIS IS THEALN OBS C AN D NFL NETWORK. TAYLOR LEWAN WALKED OFF UNDER HIS OWN POWER SMILING. THAT'S A GOOD SIGN. THE TITANS HAVE A FIRST DOWN AT THE CLEVELAND 48 YARD LINE. KENDALL WRIGHT. NOWHERE TO GO. GETS AWAY FROM BRYAN. BRYAN COMES BACK TO MAKE THE TACKLE. &gt;&gt; HERE'S LEWAN RIGHT HERE. YOU'LL SEE HE CATCHES A VERY UNCOMFORTABLE HELMET RIGHT IN THE BELLY RIGHT THERE. FOLKS, IF YOU HAVEN'T HAD A HELMET STUCK IN YOUR RIBS OR HELMET, YOU DON'T KNOW HOW PAINFUL THAT IS. YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING TO DIE. YOU CAN BREATHE ABOUT 35, 40 SECONDS. &gt;&gt; HE WAS CHUCKLING ON THE SIDE LINE. GUYS WERE MAKING FUN OF HIM. NOW HE'S BACK IN THE GAME. &gt;&gt; SECOND AND 9. WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK TO NEW YORK WITH AN UPDATE. J.B. AND BOOMER. &gt;&gt; AN EAGLES HABIT, BOOMER. &gt;&gt; STEVE TASKER LOVES STUFF LIKE, THIS HERE'S JAMES CASEY. BLOCKS THE PUNT AND PICKED UP BY MARIGOS. A 10-0 YARD TOUCHDOWN FOR THE EAGLES. TWO WEEKS IN A ROW THAT'S HOW THEY START. ANDREW, STEVE AND STEVE. &gt;&gt; THERE'S ONLY ONE STEVE TASKER. THIRD AND 9 FOR TENNESSEE. 6:14 TO GO, FIRST QUARTER. PRESSURE COMING. LOCKER IN TROUBLE. GETS AWAY. THROWS IT DOWN THE FIELD. A BIG COMPLETION, BUT A FLAG COMES IN. JOE HAYDEN ON THE COVERAGE. BROWNS ARE TRYING TO SAY IT'S AN UNCATCHABLE PASS. &gt;&gt; YEAH. THIS IS INTERFERENCE. &gt;&gt; PASS INTERFERENCE, DEFENSE. SPOT FOUL. AUTOMATIC. FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE TO GO BACK TO LOCKER. KEEPING THE PLAY ALIVE. &gt;&gt; YOU MENTIONED EARLIER, WHEN HE RUNS, HE THINKS ABOUT RUNNING DOWN THE FIELD. THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE AFRAID OF WITH HIS FEET. THIS TIME HE LOOKS UP AND YOU CAN SEE THE SCREEN ON JOE HAYDEN. YOU CAN SEE THE MAN-TO-MAN DEFENSE. QUARTERBACK BREAKS THE POCKET. THE RECEIVER CAN GO ANYWHERE. YOUR NATURAL REACTION IS TO TRY TO GRAB HIM AND FIGURE OUT WHERE HE'S GOING. &gt;&gt; THE 29-YARD PENALTY. THE TITANS GO INTO THE RED ZONE, FIRST AND 10 FROM THE 18. LOCKER FIRES LEFT TO WASHINGTON. HIS SECOND CATCH OF THE DAY. SPUN OUT -OF-BOUNDS AT THE 12 YARD LINE. NATE WASHINGTON HAS TWO CATCHES IN THIS FIRST QUARTER. &gt;&gt; AND CLEVELAND GETS A LOT OF MATCHUPS ON WASHINGTON. SOONER OR LATER SOMEBODY WILL GET SEPARATION. WE ASKED MIKE PETTINE ABOUT THIS YESTERDAY, IF HE'S GUN SHY ABOUT PLAYING MAN-TO-MAN COVERAGE GIVEN THE NEW RULES AND POINTS OF EMPHASIS. HE SAID NO WAY. YOU HAVE TO USE YOUR DEFENSIVE SCHEMES AND GET THEM IN THE FIRST FIVE YARDS AND TAKE ADVANTAGE. &gt;&gt; GREENE WITH THE BALL. HE'S GOING TO BE STOPPED SHORT OF A FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; AND DESPITE THE FACT THAT THIS CLEVELAND BROWNS TEAM HAS GIVEN UP OVER 20 POINTS IN EACH OF THEIR GAMES THIS YEAR, GOING BACK SEVEN GAMES TO LAST YEAR, THEY DO PRETTY DARN WELL IN THE RED ZONE. THE SEVENTH RANKED DEFENSE IN THE RED ZONE. THEY'RE A TEAM THAT HAS GIVEN UP A LOT OF YARDS. &gt;&gt; INSIDE FIVE TO GO IN THE FIRST QUARTER. THE TITANS HAVE NOT SCORED IN THE FIRST QUARTER THIS ENTIRE YEAR. THIRD AND 3. LOCKER TO THE RIGHT. PASS IS CAUGHT BY WRIGHT. TAKES IT IN. TOUCHDOWN TENNESSEE. &gt;&gt; AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS PLAGUED THE CLEVELAND DEFENSE THIS YEAR. GIVING UP SO MANY BIG PLAYS. THEY MISS TACKLES. JOE HAYDEN ON THE OUTSIDE GETS IN SPACE. AND THEY GOT A DEFENDER TO MAKE THE PLAY. THAT'S NOT JOE HAYDEN. THAT'S WILLIAMS. &gt;&gt; JUST DON'T MAKE THE TACKLE. GRANTED, A LOT OF SPACE FOR WRIGHT TO WORK THERE BUT YOUR DEFENDERS HAVE TO MAKE THOSE TACKLES IN SPACE. IF YOU CAN'T TACKLE, YOU CAN'T PLAY. &gt;&gt; THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THERE, WILLIAMS COMING FROM THE INSIDE. HAVE TO FORCE THE RECEIVER OUTSIDE. YOU CAN'T GET BEAT INSIDE. &gt;&gt; BAD TECHNIQUE. &gt;&gt; FIRST TIME THIS SEASON THE TITANS HAVE SCORED POINTS IN THE FIRST QUARTER. EXTRA POINT IS GOO BY RYAN SUCCOP. PASS INTERFERENCE PENALTY &gt;&gt; TENNESSEE COMES OUT TO A 7-0 LEAD THANKS TO THE TOUCHDOWN CATCH FROM KENDALL WRIGHT. FIRST POINTS SCORED IN THE FIRST QUARTER THIS SEASON BY THE TITANS. JOE HAYDEN HAS BEEN UNDER A LOT OF FIRE IN CLEVELAND. WE SPEAK TO HIM YESTERDAY ABOUT HAYDEN. THEY SAID OTHER THAN FOUR PLAYS THIS YEAR, THEY SAY HE'S PLAYING GREAT. THE PENALTY COSTLY FOR THE BROWNS ON THE LAST DRIVE. MOORE TAKES THIS OUT ACROSS THE 30 AND TO THE 33 YARD &gt;&gt; TODAY WITH NFL NOW, YOU CAN WATCH THE HIGHLIGHTS AND EXPERIENCES ON YOUR PHONE. DON'T MISS YOUR FAVORITE PLAYERS. WATCH FOR FREE TODAY AT NFL.COM/NOW. 4:38 TO GO. FIRST QUARTER. LET'S SEE IF THE BROWNS CAN ANSWER AFTER THAT TOUCHDOWN FROM LOCKER TO KENDALL WRIGHT. FIRST AND 10 CLEVELAND. BEN TATE. GETS AWAY FROM ONE. UP TO THE 33 YARD LINE. &gt;&gt; WE TALKED ABOUT JURRELL CASEY WORKING AGAINST THE DOUBLE-TEAM THERE. YOU CAN SEE HIM TRY TO SPIN OUT OF THE BLOCK THERE. BY BITONIO. CASEY HAD 10 1/2 SACKS LAST SEASON. FOR A DEFENSIVE TACKLE, THAT'S A BIG NUMBER. HE DRAW AS LOT OF DOUBLE-TEAMS. &gt;&gt; THE NATURE OF THE BEAST FOR HIM. &gt;&gt; PLAY ACTION. HOYER LOOKING DEEP. HITS A HE THROWS INTO DOUBLE COVERAGE AND IT'S INCOMPLETE. HOYER TOOK A SHOT. THAT WAS NEARLY PICKED OFF. IT WAS PITOITUA THAT APPLIED THE PRESSURE AND HIT BRIAN HOYER. &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHAT KYLE SHANAHAN WANTS TO DO. THE HARD PLAY ACTION. TAKE A SHOT UP THE FIELD. BRIAN HOYER HAS TO MAKE BETTER DECISIONS. PROTECTION WAS GOOD. PLENTY OF TIME. DOUBLE COVERAGE. ALL OF THESE PASS ROUTES, YOU CAN SEE CASEY AND PITOITUA COMING IN THERE. ALL THESE PLAYS THAT KYLE SHANAHAN DRAWS UP, THEY HAVE A BIG PLAY DOWN THE FIELD BUT IF IT'S NOT THERE, YOU HAVE TO GET TO THE SECOND OR THIRD GUY. &gt;&gt; THAT SETS UP THIRD AND 5 FROM CLEVELAND. HOYER OVER THE MIDDLE. THAT IS CAUGHT. A FIRST DOWN BY TRAVIS BENJAMIN. COTY SENSABAUGH WRAPS HIM UP. THAT BRINGS UP FOURTH DOWN. &gt;&gt; AND YOU THINK ABOUT GOING FOR IT. NOT THE WAY THE BROWN DEFENSE HAS PLAYED IN THE FIRST MONTH OF THE SEASON. IT'S MIKE PETTINE'S HEART THAT HE WOULD LOVE TO GO FOR IT ON FOURTH DOWN. WHEN YOU HAVE JUST GIVEN UP A TOUCHDOWN, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO IT PARTICULARLY AT THIS POINT ON YOUR OWN 38 YARD LINE. &gt;&gt; EXACTLY. IF THEY WERE UP NEAR THE 50 YARD LINE, MAYBE YOU HAVE AN ARGUMENT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE 50 YOU'D THINK ABOUT IT. &gt;&gt; EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE A SOLID RUN GAME, CAME OUT AND HAVE A LITTLE JUKE PLAY ON THAT THEY CALLED OFF THERE. FOURTH AND LESS THAN ONE A LOT OF HEAD COACHES WOULD GO FOR IT. &gt;&gt; McCLUSTER BACK DEEP AWAITING THE PUNT FOR LANNING. AT THE 15. McCLUSTER WRAPPED UP AT THE 20 YARD LINE. WITH THR CBS. AND THEN TUNE IN FOR MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL ON ESPN. THE TITANS HAVE 70 YARDS IN THE FIRST HALF. JAKE LOCKER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR 67 OF THOSE YARDS. 6 FOR 6 THROUGH THE AIR AND 12 YARDS RUSHING ON THE GROUND. &gt;&gt; SO IMPORTANT FOR HIM TO GET OFF TO A GOOD START. THAT TOUCHDOWN, GET THE FIRST QUARTER MONKEY OFF THEIR BACK. &gt;&gt; AND ROOM TO RUN. WHITE ACROSS MIDFIELD. BROUGHT DOWN AT THE 42 YARD LINE. A 38 YARD PICK UP FOR KENDALL WRIGHT. &gt;&gt; AND I LIKE THE PLAY CALL COMING OUT HERE. FIRST DOWN. YOU HAVE SOME MOMENTUM. KENDALL WRIGHT ON THE REVERSE. WHAT A GREAT CUT BACK RIGHT THERE. BREAKING TACKLES. YOU TALKED ABOUT THE MISSED TACKLES, STEVE TASKER, A BIG PLAY TO START THE DRIVE FOR THE TITANS. &gt;&gt; AND HE DOES THE JOHNNY MANZIEL FINGER GRAB. ALL RIGHT. KEEP AN EYE ON THAT. FIRST CARRY OF THE SEASON FOR KENDALL WRIGHT. NOW FIRST DOWN. MINGO MAKES THE TACKLE. &gt;&gt; AN IMPRESSIVE START FOR TENNESSEE IN THE FIRST QUARTER. &gt;&gt; THAT PLAY BY WRIGHT WAS HUGE. HE CAME BY WITH VELOCITY. THE QUARTERBACK HAD A NICE EXCHANGE. THAT PLAY WAS OUTSIDE TO THE EDGE BEFORE BRYANT KNEW THEY WERE RUNNING WIDE. THEY GOT THERE SO FAST TO THE EDGE, THE DEFENSE HAD NO SHOT. ONE MISSED TACKLE AND THEY'RE ON THE OTHER END OF THE FIELD. &gt;&gt; ANOTHER BIG PLAY AGAINST THE BROWNS DEFENSE. THIS HAS BEEN TOO OFTEN THIS YEAR FOR THEM. &gt;&gt; GREENE UP THE MIDDLE. FIRST DOWN. MIKE PETTINE SAID THE FOCUS OF THE BYE WEEK WAS TO FIX THE RUN DEFENSE. WHEN WE MET WITH HIM YESTERDAY, HE SAID THERE WASN'T ONE SPECIFIC THING BUT THEY STILL CONTINUE TO GET GASHED ON THE GROUND. &gt;&gt; AND YOU CAN SEE THE STAT AT THE BOTTOM. MOST IN THE NFL RUNS OF 20 YARDS OR MORE. THAT'S JUST NOT A STAT YOU WANT TO LEAD THE NFL IN. &gt;&gt; FOR MOST OFFENSES, 20 YARD RUNS HARDLY EVER HAPPEN. EVERYBODY GETS IT DONE AGAINST THE BROWNS. IT'S BEEN A REAL SURPRISE FOR EVERYBODY. &gt;&gt; AND FIRST AND 10. GOES FOR 11 YARDS. ANOTHER TENNESSEE FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN SEE THE SIGNIFICANCE -- THIS IS A TENNESSEE TITANS OFFENSE THAT HAS BEEN DORMANT THE LAST THREE WEEKS. YOU COME OUT, SCORE EARLY. GET THE CROWD BEHIND YOU. THEY LOST SIX OF THE LAST SEVEN GAMES AT HOME. ALL OF A SUDDEN, THINGS ARE GOING WELL. YOU CAN SEE THE ADRENALINE RUSH. NOW THEY BELIEVE THEY'RE GOOD AND HARD TO STOP. &gt;&gt; ALL FOUR PLAYS ON THIS DRIVE HAVE BEEN ON THE GROUND FOR TENNESSEE. THEY PICKED UP 61 YARDS. FINAL 30 SECONDS IN THE FIRST QUARTER. TENNESSEE KEEPS IT ON THE GROUND. SHONN GREENE GETS THREE MORE. &gt;&gt; THE FIRST TIME WHERE THE CLEVELAND DEFENSE HAS SET THE EDGE OF THE DEFENSE AND NOT LET THE TITANS PUSH THE ENTIRE PLAY TO THE SIDE LINE. THE OFFENSE MOVES OUT IN ZONE COVERAGE AND SPREADS THE DEFENSE FROM SIDELINE TO SIDELINE. &gt;&gt; FIRST TIME SINCE WEEK ONE THAT TENNESSEE HAS HAD A LEAD. THEY'RE PICKING UP EIGHT YARDS PER PLAY SO FAR AS WE START THE SECOND QUARTER. SECOND DOWN AND 7. LOCKER FIRES END ZONE. INCOMPLETE. HE HAD McCLUSTER. &gt;&gt; WOW! WHAT A GREAT DOUBLE MOVE BY McCLUSTER ON SCREEN. HE FAKED THE SLANT ROUTE, WENT UP THE SIDELINE. WATCH RIGHT HERE. FAKES THE SLANT. SCREEN, JUMPS US AND GETS BEAT DEEP. THAT WAS A TOUCHDOWN THEY MISSED. &gt;&gt; AND A YOUNG QUARTERBACK WITH JAKE LOCKER. CAN'T KEEP SAYING THAT. I KNOW. BUT THERE WAS NO PRESSURE ON HIM. McCLUSTER RAN A GREAT ROUTE. YOU HAVE TO MAKE THAT THROW WHEN THE OPPORTUNITY IS THERE. &gt;&gt; SO NOW IT'S THIRD DOWN AND 7. PRESSURE COMING. FLAGS DOWN. LOCKER PASSES. NEARLY INTERCEPTED. CARLOS DANSBY HAD A HAND ON IT. NOW WE WAIT TO SEE WHAT THE PENALTY MARKER IS. &gt;&gt; OFF SIDES DEFENSE, NUMBER 99. REPLAY THIRD DOWN. &gt;&gt; ANOTHER BIG PENALTY ON PAUL KRUEGER. &gt;&gt; A HUGE PENALTY. NUMBER 1, THAT SHOULD HAVE PICKED OFF AND GONE THE OTHER WAY. COULD HAVE BEEN A PICK SIX. TO HAVE A PENALTY ON A THIRD DOWN STOP IS JUST REALLY -- &gt;&gt; THIRD AND 7 BECOMES THIRD AND 2. NATE WASHINGTON IN MOTION. LOCKER STEPS UP. HAS THE FIRST DOWN AND TOUCHDOWN! JAKE LOCKER TAKES IT IN. TENNESSEE UP 13-0. A LATE FLAG IS DOWN. LOCKER REMAINS ON THE GROUND. &gt;&gt; THEY WENT FROM HAVING A FOURTH DOWN FLAY TO GIVING UP THE TOUCHDOWN. NOW THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME WORDS THERE. SOMEBODY GAVE LOCKER AND EXTRA SHOT GOING INTO THE END ZONE. HE'S STILL DOWN. &gt;&gt; IT WAS A LATE HIT. I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS ANY CHANCE TO AVOID THAT. YOU CAN SEE THE CONTACT AT THE END OF THE PLAY. &gt;&gt; IT WAS THE ROOKIE OUT OF IOWA, CURTSEY. &gt;&gt; LED WITH THE FOREARM. &gt;&gt; AND STILL PUSHING. &gt;&gt; THE TITANS RAN BACK INTO THE FREY. &gt;&gt; THEY SHOWED THE REPLAY HERE IN THE STADIUM AND THAT GOT THE TITANS MORE AGITATED. &gt;&gt; AND NOW CURTSEY IS A WANTED MAN. THEY'RE LOOKING HIM UP. THAT WAS IN THE END ZONE, LATE. ARE THEY EJECTING HIM FROM THE GAME? &gt;&gt; THERE'S NO OFFICIAL CALL YET. &gt;&gt; THE REFEREES ARE HAVING A HUDDLE ABOUT IT. IF YOU LOOK AT THE CORNER. THERE'S FIVE PENALTIES -- A NEW NFL RECORD. FIVE PENALTY FLAGS IN THE END ZONE. WE LAUGH ABOUT IT, BUT IT'S GOOD TO SEE JAKE LOCKER UP AND BACK ON THE SIDELINE. LET ME TELL YOU, HE HAS TO BE CAREFUL. BOTH OF HIS RUNS -- HE'S SO GOOD AND ATHLETIC RUNNING THE FOOTBALL BUT HE PUTS HIMSELF IN HARM'S WAY THE WAY HE ATTACKS. HE HAS TO BE CAREFUL AND BE SMART. &gt;&gt; IT'S HIS FIFTH CAREER RUSHING TOUCHDOWN. THE OFFICIALS SORT THIS ONE OUT. &gt;&gt; AFTER THE TOUCHDOWN, UNNECESSARY ROUGHNESS, DEFENSE, 93 WITH A HIT ON THE QUARTERBACK. FOLLOWING THAT, WE HAVE UNNECESSARY ROUGHNESS, NUMBER 72 OF TENNESSEE. THOSE PENALTIES ARE GOING TO OFFSET. THE TOUCHDOWN COUNTS AND WE'LL TRY THE POINT AFTER. &gt;&gt; THEY CHANGED THE NUMBER. IT WASN'T ARMANI BRYANT. IT WAS KIRKSEY. HERE'S ANOTHER ANGLE. &gt;&gt; HERE'S THE GOOD LOOK. YOU CAN SEE THE RIGHT FOREARM COME ACROSS THE CHIN. MAN. &gt;&gt; AND NOW MICHAEL OHER ON THE TITANS CALLED FOR THE PENALTY. &gt;&gt; MICHAEL OHER WAS CLEARLY TO THE SIDELINE. THAT I SAW THE BIG SCREEN REPLAY OF THE HIT. AND THEN THE TITANS REALIZED WHAT HAPPENED. THEY DID NOT LIKE IT. MICHAEL OHER MOST NOTABLY. &gt;&gt; OFFSETTING PENALTIES. AND NOW HERE'S RYAN SUCCOP FOR THE EXTRA POINT TO TRY TO MAKE IT 14-0. THAT DRIVE FOR TENNESSEE SEVEN PLAYS, SIX RUNS. AND THEY MOVE RIGHT DOWN THE FIELD. 75 YARDS RUSHING ON THAT DRIVE FOR TENNESSEE. AND MORE PUSHING AND SHOVING. ANOTHER FLAG COMES IN. TEMPERS CONTINUE TO FLARE HERE IN NASHVILLE. ONE POSITIVE OF THIS IS THE OFFICIAL IS A VERY EXPERIENCED NFL OFFICIAL. YOU CAN BET HE'S NOT GOING TO LOSE THE HANDLE. &gt;&gt; AFTER THE PLAY, UNNECESSARY ROUGHNESS, OFFENSE, NUMBER IS EVEN 7. 15-YARD PENALTY WILL BE ASSESSED ON THE KICKOFF. &gt;&gt; THAT'S ON THE ROOKIE, TAYLOR LEWAN. AFTER ALL THAT -- IT WAS ALL STARTED BY THE KIRKSEY HIT. IT'S THE BROWNS THAT WILL BENEFIT. TWO PENALTIES GOING AGAINST TENNESSEE. THAT'S A BAD JOB BY THE TITANS. LET'S BE HONEST. CHRIS KIRKSEY LAYS THE FOREARM AND NOW THE BROWNS BENEFIT. &gt;&gt; A MARK OF A CHAMPIONSHIP CALIBER FOOTBALL TEAM AND A COACH THAT HAS THE MESSAGE ACROSS TO HIS TEAM, KEEP YOUR COMPOSURE. KEEP YOUR POISE. EVEN THOUGH THE EMOTIONS ARE HIGH AND YOU WANT TO RETALIATE FOR SOMETHING THAT WAS UNACCEPTABLE, KEEP YOUR COOL AND UNDERSTAND YOU'LL GET ANOTHER SHOT AT SOME POINT. &gt;&gt; THE BEST REVENGE IS PLAYING BETTER THAN THE OTHER GUY. DON'T TAKE A SHOT OR TALK TO THEM. THE BEST REVENGE FOR A HIT LIKE THAT IS TO SCORE AND SCORE AND SCORE. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; KEN WHISENHUNT JUST CHEWED OUT TAYLOR LEWAN. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT KEN WHISENHUNT IS TRYING TO DO RIGHT NOW. TRYING TO MAKE A STATEMENT TO HIS YOUNG OFFENSIVE LINEMEN AND THE REST OF THE TEAM. LISTEN, IF WE WANT TO GET TO THE PLAYOFFS, FIRST AND FOREMOST, EVERYBODY HAS TO BUY IN. WE HAVE TO KEEP OUR COMPOSURE AND KEEP OUR POISE. WE CAN'T HAVE THOSE MOMENTARY LAPSES OF JUDGMENT. &gt;&gt; SUCCOP KICKS IT AWAY. AND MOORE FROM THE 5. OFF THE 25. TO THE OUTSIDE. ANOTHER FLAG COMES IN BEHIND THE PLAY. MOORE IS TACKLED AT THE 31 YARD LINE. &gt;&gt; ANOTHER CONFERENCE NOW. ANOTHER FLAG ON THE FAR SIDE. TWO FLAGS ON THIS PLAY AS WELL. &gt;&gt; DURING THE RETURN, HOLDING, RETURN TEAM, NUMBER 24. TEN YARD PENALTY, FIRST DOWN CLEVELAND. &gt;&gt; GO BACK TO THAT POINT AFTER WHERE LEWAN GOT CALLED. HE'S ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE SCREEN. &gt;&gt; HERE'S THE END ON THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. HAPPENS AFTER THE KICK IS GONE. THERE, THAT LAST LITTLE BIT. THAT EXTRA EMOTION. THAT WAS AFTER THE PLAY THAT THEY HAD IN THE END ZONE WITH THE QUARTERBACK. YOU KNOW THE OFFICIALS WILL CALL IT TIGHT TO GET THE LID ON THE GAME. &gt;&gt; AND COULD GET AN ACADEMY AWARD THERE, TOO. &gt;&gt; HE WAS THE GUILTY PARTY ON THE KICKOFF. AND THE TITANS' RUN DEFENSE COMES UP BIG. WOODS LEADING THE CHARGE. &gt;&gt; IF YOU WANT TO GET YOUR OPPONENT STIRRED UP, TAKE A SHOT AT THEIR QUARTERBACK. NOW YOU HAVE AL WOODS BLASTING THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE BROWNS LINE THROUGH ALEX MACK, WHO IS -- ALEX MACK IS NOT JUST ANOTHER GUY. HE'S A GOOD PLAYER. THIS TITAN'S DEFENSE AND THE ENTIRE TITAN'S ROSTER HAS GOT IT TURNED UP ALL THE WAY NOW ALL THANKS TO THAT HIT IN THE END ZONE ON THEIR QUARTERBACK. HOYER OVER THE MIDDLE. CAUGHT BY JORDAN CAMERON FOR A FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; HOYER SAYS THAT CAMERON IS REALLY HIS SAFETY VALVE. IN A BIG SPOT HERE, THEY COME UP WITH A 19-YARD GAIN. &gt;&gt; JORDAN CAMERON IS REALLY THE OFFENSIVE PLAYER THAT JUMPS OUT AT YOU WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE CLEVELAND BROWNS. BRIAN HOYER, A LOT OF CONFIDENCE PUTTING THAT BALL UP HIGH. CAMERON WENT TO THE PRO BOWL LAST YEAR. HE'S INJURED THIS YEAR BUT HE'S BACK AT A FULL GO NOW. &gt;&gt; HE DID NOT PLAY WEEK TWO BECAUSE OF A RIGHT SPRAINED SHOULDER. AND RUNNING LEFT. ACROSS THE 40 YARD LINE. &gt;&gt; THAT IS A NICE RUN BY THE YOUNG RUNNING BACK, WEST. THESE YOUNG RUNNING BACKS CONTINUE TO HELP THE BROWNS. &gt;&gt; TEMPO FOR THE BROWNS OFFENSE ON THIRD AND 1. WEST HAS THE FIRST DOWN ACROSS THE 45 YARD LINE. &gt;&gt; INTERESTING TO SEE TODAY THE CARRY BREAKDOWN WITH THESE THREE BACKS FOR CLEVELAND. &gt;&gt; KYLE SHANAHAN DID TELL ME BEFORE THE GAME, IF HE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE-UP THE PACE OF THE GAME, HE WAS GOING TO DO IT WITH THE UP TEMPO. &gt;&gt; AND BRIAN HOYER SAID HE WANTED TO SEE HOW THE TENNESSEE DEFENSE REACTED TO THE UP TEMPO. BEN TATE GETS TO THE 40. MORGAN WITH THE TACKLE. &gt;&gt; WE'VE SEEN SO MANY TEAMS GO UP TEMPO AND SPREAD IT. THE BROWNS UP TEMPO AND POUNDING. &gt;&gt; PLAY ACTION ON SECOND AND SITUATION. HOYER, THE SCREEN. NOT MUCH DOING. JIM GRAY TRIED TO MAKE A CATCH. RULED INCOMPLETE. &gt;&gt; IT WAS THE PRESSURE UP THE FIELD IN BRIAN HOYER'S FACE THAT FORCED HIM TO THROW THAT BALL EARLY. YOU CAN SEE THERE. THE PRESSURE COMING UP THE FIELD. IT WAS BERNARD POLLARD. DIDN'T BUY IT ON THE HARD PLAY ACTION FAKE TO THE LEFT SIDE. THE BIG THIRD DOWN NOW FACING THE CLEVELAND BROWNS. &gt;&gt; AND THEY'RE 0 FOR 2 ON THIRD DOWN STILL TODAY. 0 FOR 4 IN THE FOURTH QUARTER AGAINST BALTIMORE IN WEEK THREE. THIRD AND 6. HOYER THROWS RIGHT TO MAKE THE CATCH FOR THE FIRST DOWN. ANDREW HAWKINS WITH HIS TEAM-LEADING 22nd CATCH OF THE SEASON. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY BRIAN HOYER IS SO INTRIGUING. HE GETS RID OF IT SO FAST. STEP, THROW, GONE. RIGHT ON THE SIDELINE. HAWKINS PULLS IT IN. IT LOOKS TOO EASY. THERE'S NO CHANCE FOR THE TITANS TO GET ANY KIND OF PRESSURE OR SACK. SPREADS THE DEFENDERS SO THIN. GREAT THROW BY HOYER. &gt;&gt; HAWKINS SEVENTH IN THE NFL. SEVEN CATCHES PER GAME. AND TATE UP THE MIDDLE. A FIRST DOWN. THIS IS JUST WHAT THE DOCTOR ORDERED FOR CLEVELAND IN TERMS OF THIS DRIVE. &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE CLASSIC KYLE SHANAHAN ZONE SCHEME RUNNING THE BALL. TRYING TO GET THE RUNNING BACK TO PUSH IT UP INTO THE HOLE ON THE PLAY SIDE WHEN YOU CREATE THE CUT BACK LANES. &gt;&gt; SIX CARRIES FOR TATE. SPINNING HIS WAY TO THE 21 YARD LINE. GOOD NUMBERS IN HIS CAREER, BEN TATE, AGAINST TENNESSEE. FIVE CAREER GAMES. 323 YARDS. AVERAGING 6 YARDS PER CARRY. HE HAS 48 YARDS RUSHING IN THE FIRST HALF. THE SCREEN PASS IS BATTED DOWN. HECK OF A PLAY THERE BY SEAN PHILLIPS. &gt;&gt; PHILLIPS IS A VETERAN THAT PLAYED IN SAN DIEGO FOR SO MANY YEARS. NOTHING THAT HOYER ON THE BROWNS WILL THROW AT HIM THAT HE HASN'T SEEN OR DEFENDED. A FORMER PRO BOWL-TYPE PLAYER THAT IS ADDING DEPTH AND A GREAT JOB. &gt;&gt; THAT WAS A FIRST DOWN SAVE. WOULD HAVE BEEN A FIRST DOWN FOR CLEVELAND. &gt;&gt; FANS ON THEIR FEET HERE IN NASHVILLE. THIRD DOWN AND 4 FOR CLEVELAND. 11th PLAY OF THE DRIVE. AND IT'S TIME-OUT CALLED FOR BY THE BROWNS. &gt;&gt; YEAH, I AGREE &gt;&gt; FIRST TIME OUT OF THE HALF FOR THE CLEVELAND BROWNS. 10:49 TO GO SECOND QUARTER. BIG THIRD DOWN FOR CLEVELAND. THIRD AND 4. &gt;&gt; LOOK FOR CAMERON COMING IN MOTION THERE. &gt;&gt; HOYER LOOKING HIS WAY. MAKES THE CATCH. IMMEDIATELY WRAPPED UP. IT'S THE VETERAN GEORGE WILSON THAT MAKES THE TACKLE. &gt;&gt; THAT WAS READ PERFECTLY BY WILSON. HE SAW CAMERON COMING TO THE FLAT THERE. CAMERON THOUGHT HE HAD SPACE. NO. HE RAN BY THE BLOCK OF HAWKINS. HAWKINS HAS TO MAKE A BLOCK ON THAT. KYLE SHANAHAN NOT PLEASED WITH THAT. HE'S ONE BLOCK AWAY FROM MAKING THAT CONVERSION. &gt;&gt; ASKING A 5'7&quot; 180 GO MAKING A 200-POUND SAFETY. IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. &gt;&gt; AND THE FIELD GOAL TRY BY CUNDIFF. THIS IS GOOD. THE BROWNS ARE ON THE BOARD. &gt;&gt; DID NOT END WITH A TOUCHDOWN, BUT STILL AN IMPORTANT DRIVE FOR THE CLEVELAND BROWNS. GIVES THEIR DEFENSE A REST THERE WITH THE 4 1/2 MINUTE DRIVE. CUNDIFF CAPPED IT OFF WITH A 38-YARD FIELD GOAL. THE BROWNS ON THE BOARD. 14-3. LEON WASHINGTON IS BACK DEEP FOR THE TITANS. AND THAT ONE GOES THROUGH THE END ZONE FOR A TOUCHBACK. THAT WILL BRING JAKE LOCKER BACK OUT. ALREADY AN INTERESTING DAY FOR LOCKER WHO HAD THE TOUCHDOWN RUN. &gt;&gt; AND HE'S GOING TO THROW HIS BODY AROUND. HE'S HAD INJURY ISSUES. THESE DOCTORS IN THE NFL VERY, VERY IN TUNE WITH THE PROTOCOL TO GO THROUGH TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S NO LINGERING EFFECTS FROM THAT HIT. I GUARANTEE YOU HE WILL BE MONITORED THE REST OF THE GAME. IF HE'S NOT 100%, HE WILL BE TAKEN OUT. &gt;&gt; IT'S A DELAYED REACTION A LOT OF TIMES WITH THE CONCUSSION. YOU DON'T SHOW THE SYMPTOMS TILL LATER IN THE GAME. LOCKER'S PASS TO THE SIDELINE IS REELED IN BY HUNTER. &gt;&gt; THAT'S A GOOD STATEMENT BY JAKE LOCKER. A GREAT OPPORTUNITY. CONFIDENCE BY KEN WHISENHUNT TO COME OUT AFTER A HIT LIKE THAT AND LET HIM THROW IT AWAY. A NICE THROW, ON TIME. A GOOD POSITIVE THROW FOR LOCKER AND THE TROOPS. &gt;&gt; LOCKER RUNNING RIGHT. GOING TO PUT HIS HEAD DOWN AND KEEP IT ACROSS THE 35.A FLAG COMES IN AT THE 45 YARD LINE IN THE SECONDARY. THE OFFICIALS ARE INDICATING THIS IS AGAINST THE BROWNS. &gt;&gt; HOLDING, DEFENSE. NUMBER 22. FIVE-YARD PENALTY ADDED TO THE END OF THE RUN. AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPENS, THESE DBs, WHEN THEY SEE THAT QUARTERBACK BREAK CONTAIN AND START TO RUN, THEY THROW THE RECEIVERS OFF THEM. IF THE QUARTERBACK IS STILL BEHIND THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE OR IF THE OFFICIAL SEES IT THE OTHER WAY, THEY STILL GET CALLED FOR A HOLDING EVEN IF IT TURNS INTO A QUARTERBACK RUN. &gt;&gt; FIRST DOWN FOR TENNESSEE. PLAY ACTION, LOCKER. NOWHERE TO GO. AND THE TACKLE FROM BEHIND BY SHEARD. &gt;&gt; AND THAT WAS NOT A PRESSURE SACK. A COVERAGE SACK. NOWHERE FOR LOCKER TO GO. THEY COME BACK, TRY TO HIT THE PLAY ACTION. GREAT JOB IN THE SECONDARY. ON THAT NOTE, THAT ILLEGAL CONTACT, DEFENSIVE HOLDING. IT'S SO TOUGH TO BE A DEFENSIVE PLAYER THESE DAYS. IT'S A DIFFERENT GAME. &gt;&gt; IT IS. WE SPOKE ABOUT IT EARLIER. MIKE PETTINE SAID YOU CAN HIT THEM IN THE FIRST FIVE YARDS. YOU HAVE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT IN THE FIRST FIVE YARDS. OTHERWISE, YOU HAVE NO SHOT. &gt;&gt; AND SHONN GREENE ON THE CARRY. 8:20 TO GO FIRST HALF. &gt;&gt; THAT WAS A GREAT PLAY CALLED FOR THAT SITUATION BY KEN WHISENHUNT WHO CALLS THE PLACE FOR THE TENNESSEE TITANS. CLEVELAND HAD A WELL-DESIGNED BLITZ OFF THE END BY MINGO. LOOKING FOR THE HOLE ON THIRD DOWN. THIRD AND 4 FOR THE TITANS. THERE GOES McCLUSTER TO THE TOP OF THE SCREEN. FIVE ON THE PLAY CLOCK. LOCKER HAS TIME. NOW HE WANTS TO RUN. HE HAS THE FIRST DOWN. BALL CAME OUT LATE AT THE END. IT'S A FIRST DOWN FOR TENNESSEE. &gt;&gt; ONCE AGAIN, JAKE LOCKER MAKING THE PLAY WITH HIS LEGS. YOU CAN SEE THAT IS A GOOD MOVE. DODGES THE BIG HIT. YEAH, THE BALL COMES OUT AFTER HE HITS THE GROUND. A GOOD DOWN BY CONTACT CALL BY THE OFFICIALS. JAKE LOCKER WHILE IN HAS BEEN EFFECTIVE AND HELPED THE TITANS TODAY, YOU THINK SOONER OR LATER THAT WILL CATCH UP TO THEM. &gt;&gt; THESE GUYS ARE TOO GOOD. THEY CAN TACKLE RUNNING BACKS IN THE OPEN FIELD. HE'S GOING TO TAKE SOME HITS. &gt;&gt; 7:03 TO GO IN THE SECOND QUARTER. TOMORROW ON &quot;NCIS LOS ANGELES&quot;, L.L. COOL J AND CHRIS O'DONNELL STAR IN AN EPISODE YOU DON'T WANT TO MISS. THAT'S TOMORROW AT 10/9 CENTRAL ONLY ON CBS. WITH THE STEVES, BEUERLEIN AND TASKER, I'M ANDREW CATALON. THANKS FOR JOINING US FOR WEEK FIVE IN THE NFL ON CBS. STEVE BEUERLEIN A PRO BOWL IN 99. STEVE TASKER KNOWS ABOUT THAT. 7 PRO BOWLS IN BUFFALO. &gt;&gt; PHIL TAYLOR HAS A KNEE INJURY FOR CLEVELAND. HE'S RETURN IS QUESTIONABLE. WE'LL KEEP AN EYE ON THAT. SHONN GREENE CUTS IT BACK INSIDE. STILL GOING. AND THE TITANS CONTINUE TO GET THE JOB DONE ON THE GROUND. DANSBY AND MINGO MAKE THE TACKLE. &gt;&gt; THE TENNESSEE TITANS COMING INTO THIS GAME, THEY WERE THE 17th RANKING RUSHING TEAM IN THE NFL. BE -- CLEVELAND HAS TO STOP THE RUN ONIRST DOWN IF THEY WANT TO SHUT THIS OFFENSE DOWN. &gt;&gt; TENNESSEE HAS 118 YARDS RUSHING SO FAR IN THE FIRST HALF. LOCKER PLAY ACTION. IN TROUBLE. FIRES IT AWAY. SHEARD BROUGHT THE HEAT. &gt;&gt; ONE THING I DIDN'T LIKE ABOUT THE PLAY, DELANIE WALKER, MAYBE THEIR BEST OFFENSIVE PLAYER, ENDED UP BLOCKING ON A DEFENSIVE END. TWO GUYS ON THE ROUTE, THE TWO WIDE RECEIVERS. EVERYBODY ELSE WAS STANDING THERE TRYING TO PROTECT JAKE LOCKER. THE CLEVELAND BROWNS DID A GREAT JOB OF RECOGNIZING IT, COVERING THE TWO GUYS OUTSIDE. LOCKER HAD TO THROW IT AWAY. &gt;&gt; WHY DO YOU CALL A MAX PROTECTION LIKE THAT? YOU CALL IT BECAUSE YOU'RE EXPECTING BLITZ. WHEN THEY DON'T BLITZ, YOU HAVE TWO RECEIVERS, NOWHERE TO GO WITH THE FOOTBALL. &gt;&gt; LOCKER'S PASS IS DROPPED. LOW THROW. JUSTIN HUNTER COULDN'T BRING IT IN. THAT BRINGS UP THIRD DOWN. &gt;&gt; JAKE LOCKER IS A 50% CAREER PASSER, THIS YEAR, 55%. HE HAS TO GET THAT INTO THE 60s. THIS SAN OPPORTUNITY HERE. THE BALL IS LOW. IS THAT BALL A BALL THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN CAUGHT? SURE, IT SHOULD BE CAUGHT. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE GREAT QUARTERBACKS, THE MOST ACCURATE ONES, THEY GET THE BALL TO THE RECEIVER WHERE THEY CAN CATCH IT, TURN IT UP AND MAKE EXTRA YARDS. HE SHOULD HAVE MADE A BETTER THROW THERE. &gt;&gt; THIRD AND 10 FOR THE TITANS. HUNTER MAKES THE CATCH AT THE 37. CUTS IT INSIDE. HE'S GOT THE FIRST DOWN. GREAT MOVES AFTER THE CATCH BY JUSTIN HUNTER. KIRKSEY MAKES THE TACKLE. &gt;&gt; THIS IS JUST POOR TACKLING. YOU HAVE THE GUYS PURSUING FROM THE INSIDE. KIRKSEY IS COMING INSIDE. WATCH. JOE HAYDEN DOES A NICE JOB MAKING THE RECEIVER STOP. KIRKSEY TAKES A POOR ANGLE. JOE HAYDEN DOES THE RIGHT THING. HE GETS THE INSIDE PURSUIT. IT'S JUST NOT THERE. &gt;&gt; HIS JOB IS TO DO WHAT HE DID. FORCE HIM BACK INSIDE AND GET HELP. LOOK AT THE FIRST DOWN CONVERT. &gt;&gt; SHEARD MAKE THE TACKLE. &gt;&gt; IT'S THE POOR THINGS IN THE SECONDARY THAT OVERPURSUES AND MAKES THE CUTBACKS, MISSES THE TACKLES. THE BROWNS DEFENSE, ALL OF A SUDDEN IT LOOKS LIKE THEY CAN'T PLAY. YOU HAVE SOME GUYS DOING THE RIGHT THING. IF IT WAS JUST A GUY TAKING THE PROPER ANGLE, MAKING THE TACKLE WHERE THEY HAVE THE GUY HEMMED IN, THIS DEFENSE IS TRANSFORMED. RIGHT NOW IT LOOKS LIKE THEY CAN'T IDENTIFY THEMSELVES. &gt;&gt; SHOULD HAVE BEEN A GAIN. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; THE TITANS AVERAGE SEVEN YARDS A CARRY IN THE FIRST HALF. THEY SLING IT TO McCLUSTER. RUNNING RIGHT. HE'S TACKLED AT THE 20 YARD LINE. GOOD CONTAINMENT BY THE BROWNS DEFENSE. &gt;&gt; AND DANSBY SPLIT THE TWO GUARDS RIGHT THERE COMING OUT TO GET IN FRONT OF THE PLAY. DANSBY KNIFED BETWEEN THEM AND FORCED McCLUSTER TO STOP AND WAIT FOR HIM TO PASS. THAT BLEW THE PLAY UP. GOOD JOB BY DANSBY. &gt;&gt; AND TENNESSEE IS 4 AND 5 ON THIRD DOWN. WORST IN THE LEAGUE COMING INTO IT. &gt;&gt; PRESSURE COMING. LOCKER HITS A HE THROWS. IT'S INCOMPLETE. &gt;&gt; THIS IS A PENALTY. &gt;&gt; A FLAG DOWN. &gt;&gt; WOW! &gt;&gt; LOCKER GOT HIT IN THE FACE BY BUSTER SCREEN. &gt;&gt; TWO FOULS. HOLDING, DEFENSE, NUMBER 23. THAT PENALTY IS DECLINED. ALSO, PERSONAL FOUL ROUGHING THE PASSER. BLOW TO THE HEAD. DEFENSE, NUMBER 22. HALF THE DISTANCE TO THE GOAL. AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; SO ANOTHER PENALTY ON JOE HAYDEN. IT'S BUSTER THAT GETS CALLED FOR HITTING THE QUARTERBACK. IT'S ANOTHER KILLER PENALTY ON THIRD DOWN. TAKE A LOOK. &gt;&gt; GOT HIT IN THE FACE. CHARLIE WHITEHURST IS WARMING UP ON THE SIDELINE RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; LOCKER HAS TO COME OFF THE FIELD. &gt;&gt; LOOKS LIKE HE GOT HIT IN THE FACE. GOT WHO KNOWS WHAT. &gt;&gt; OH, BOY. &gt;&gt; REMEMBER, IT WAS THE RIGHT WRIST THAT KEPT HIM OUT LAST WEEK AGAINST INDIANAPOLIS. &gt;&gt; THAT'S NOT GOOD FOR JAKE LOCKER IF IT'S THE RIGHT HAND AGAIN. &gt;&gt; SECOND CHOICE TIME-OUT, TENNESSEE. &gt;&gt; SO TENNESSEE CALLS TIME OUT. JAKE LOCKER IS HEADED TO THE LOCKER ROOM WITH 3:59 TO GO IN THE SECOND QUARTER. &gt;&gt; THAT IS ABOUT THE WORST THING THAT YOU COULD POSSIBLY SEE IF YOUR A TENNESSEE TITAN'S SUPPORTER. THEY'RE GOING TO GET AN X-RAY. &gt;&gt; THE AMAZING THING IS, YOU'VE SEEN LOCKING RUN ALL OVER THE FIELD. HE'S BEEN RUNNING UP AND DOWN THE FIELD. THIS HAPPENS IN THE POCKET WHERE HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE, RELEASING IT INTO THE FACE OF AN ONCOMING BLTZ. THAT'S WHERE HE GETS HURT. IT'S SO UNPREDICTABLE. THAT POSITION,THE QUARTERBACK, IS NOT ONLY ONE WHERE HE HAS TO WATCH WHAT HE'S DOING TO STAY HEALTHY BUT ALSO THE SCHEME HAS TO MAKE SURE THAT HE'S PROTECTED AND HE HAS SOMEBODY TO BLOCK EVERYBODY. &gt;&gt; BACK IN WEEK THREE IN CINCINNATI, THIS IS THE PLAY THAT HE HURT HIS REST ON THAT KEPT HIM OUT LAST WEEK. SO NOW IT'S WHITEHURST WHO IS INTO THE GAME. 12 OF 23 A WEEK AGO. WHITEHURST HAS PLENTY OF TIME. RUNNING RIGHT. CHASED BY RUBEN AND THROWS IT AWAY. &gt;&gt; A GOOD CALL BY TENNESSEE. YOU HAVE A COLD QUARTERBACK COMING IN. YOU'VE BEEN RUNNING THE FOOTBALL WELL. YOU HAVE TO THINK THAT THE CLEVELAND BROWNS ARE GOING TO THINK YOU'RE GOING TO HAND IT OFF. FORGET WHITEHURST PLAYED THE ENTIRE GAME LAST WEEK. HAVING HIM COME IN AND THROW THE FOOTBALL. TRY TO CATCH HIM NAPPING. &gt;&gt; CHARLIE WHITEHURST HAS STARTED FIVE GAMES BUT HE'S EXPERIENCED. USED TO BEING IN THESE SITUATIONS. HE RAN FOR 40 YARDS LAST WEEK. HE'S A GUY THAT KEN WHISENHUNT FEELS COMFORTABLE WITH. &gt;&gt; AND NOW -- &gt;&gt; THE CLOCK ISSUE. &gt;&gt; THE OFFICIALS STOP PLAY WITH 3:49 TO GO. &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET AN EXPLANATION FOR THAT. HERE WE GO. &gt;&gt; SECOND AND 10 FOR TENNESSEE. &gt;&gt; BALL AT THE 10 YARD LINE. THEY CAN'T GET A FIRST DOWN WITHOUT SCORING A TOUCHDOWN. WHITEHURST TO THE AIR. LOOKING END ZONE AND IT'S CAUGHT IN THE BACK OF THE END ZONE FOR A TOUCHDOWN! KENDALL WRIGHT, HIS SECOND OF THE DAY. &gt;&gt; WHAT A GREAT THROW BY WHITEHURST. RIGHT INTO THE CORNER. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN SEE QUARTERBACKS WORKING ON THIS. YOU GO TO PRACTICES. THEY THROW IT UP AND TRY TO DUMP INTO A GARBAGE CAN AT THE PYLON. THAT'S ABOUT PERFECT. WRIGHT DOWN A GREAT JOB GETTING HIS FEET IN. A SMALL WINDOW. WHITEHURST HITS IT. THAT'S PERFECTLY EXECUTED BY TENNESSEE. &gt;&gt; FIRST TWO TOUCHDOWN GAME OF KENDALL WRIGHT'S CAREER. HOW ABOUT CHARLIE WHITEHURST? COMES INTO THE GAME. TWO PASSES AND THEY PUT SIX MORE POINTS ON THE BOARD. THREE TRIPS TO THE RED ZONE FOR TENNESSEE TODAY. &gt;&gt; IT IS 21-3 IN FAVOR OF TENNESSEE. 3:43 TO GO SECOND QUARTER. IT'S BREAST CANCER AWARENESS MONTH. ANNUAL SCREENING SAVES LIVES. HELP BEAT THE FIGHT AGAINST BREAST CANCER BY GOING TO NFL.COM/PINK. YOU CAN PARTICIPATE IN A CRUCIAL CATCH DAY ON OCTOBER 25. LET'S GO BACK TO THE TOUCHDOWN BY TENNESSEE. &gt;&gt; I'M A HUGE JOE HAYDEN FAN. I'M CONFIDENT THAT IF WERE PUT ON THE MARKET AS A FREE AGENT, THERE WOULD BE 31 TEAMS THAT WOULD WANT HIM. BUT YOU CAN SEE HE HAS NO THREAT. HE SHOULD BE FALLING BACK INTO THE BACK OF THE END ZONE. I DON'T BELIEVE HE KNEW THAT CHARLIE WHITEHURST WOULD HAVE THE GUTS TO THROW THAT OVER THE TOP. THAT'S JOE HAYDEN'S PLAY TO MAKE. HE HAS TO TAKE AWAY THAT THROW. &gt;&gt; THE THREE RED ZONE TRIPS TODAY FOR TENNESSEE AND THEY HAVE CASHED IN WITH A . &gt;&gt; YOU CAN ACCESS ALL OF TODAY'S FOOTBALL ACTION ON THE GO. DOWNLOAD THE AWARD-WINNING CBS SPORTS APP RIGHT NOW FOR INSTANT SCORES, BREAKING NEWS, VIDEO AND MORE ALL ON YOUR PHONE. FIRST AND 10 FOR CLEVELAND. THEY TRIAL 21-3. START THIS DRIVE ON THE GROUND TO BEN TATE. A STIFF-ARM AND OUT-OF-BOUNDS AT THE 25 YARD LINE. &gt;&gt; 7th CARRY OF THE FIRST HALF FOR BEN TATE. HE HAS 53 YARDS RUSHING. &gt;&gt; BEN TATE IS NOT THE PROBLEM. THE CLEVELAND OFFENSE HAS TO DO SOMETHING ON THIS DRIVE BEFORE THE HALF. THEY HAVE TO GET IT INTO THE END ZONE. YOU CAN SEE THE LEADING RUSHERS. RUNNING THE BALL WELL. &gt;&gt; ON THIRD DOWN. A PROBLEM HERE FOR THE BROWNS IN THE FIRST HALF. ONE OUT OF 4. THIS IS SECOND DOWN. HOYER STEPS UP, THROWS OVER THE MIDDLE TO HAWKINS. INCOMPLETE. HE WAS OPEN. BUT COULD NOT CONNECT WITH HOYER. &gt;&gt; YEAH, THEY GOT TIED UP IN THE MIDDLE. HAWKINS GOT TIED UP. YOU CAN SEE THE TWO RECEIVERS TRYING TO DODGE EACH OTHER. &gt;&gt; HE'S ONLY 5'7.&quot; THAT'S NOT A BIG TARGET TO HIT ACROSS THE MIDDLE. &gt;&gt; BROWNS 1 FOR 4 ON THIRD DOWN. THIRD DOWN AND 5. 3:11 TO GO FIRST HALF. HOYER. IT'S BROKEN UP. THE ROOKIE, WILLIAMS, GOT A HAND ON IT FOR TENNESSEE. &gt;&gt; YEAH, I THINK HOYER IS TRYING TO FORCE THIS IN. CAMERON IS PRETTY WELL COVERED. JUST A QUICK OUT. IT'S INSIDE FIVE YARDS. SO THE CONTACT AND ALL THAT STUFF, THE HOLDING THAT USUALLY TAKES PLACE DOESN'T A PLAY BECAUSE IT WAS A SHORT ROUTE WHERE THE DEFENDER CAN JAM HIM. THAT'S WHAT THEY DID. &gt;&gt; LANNING KICKS IT AWAY. McCLUSTER WAITING FOR IT AT THE 20 YARD LINE. AND GOOD COVERAGE BY THE BROWNS ON SPECIAL TEAMS. COMING UP ON THE VERI&quot;VERIZON HALFTIME REPORT&quot;, YOU CAN GET THE LATEST SCORES, HIGHLIGHTS AS WELL AS A PREVIEW OF THURSDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL ON CBS AND NFL NETWORK. THAT'S COMING UP ON THE &quot;VERIZON HALFTIME REPORT.&quot; JOE HAYDEN AND THE BROWNS DEFENSE BACK OUT. THEY HAVE GIVEN UP 21 POINTS IN THE FIRST HALF. IT'S STILL CHARLIE WHITEHURST AT QUARTERBACK FOR TENNESSEE. JAKE LOCKER GOT HIT ON HIS RIGHT HAPPENED AND WENT INTO THE LOCKER ROOM. WE'RE BEING TOLD LOCKER'S RETURN IS QUESTIONABLE WITH A RIGHT HAND INJURY. RIGHT NOW IT'S CHARLIE WHITEHURST FOR THE TITANS. WHITEHURST WANTS THE THROW AGAIN. LOOKING DEEP. HAS A MAN. IT'S CAUGHT. OFF TO THE RACES FOR HUNTER. AT THE 10, 5, TOUCHDOWN! 75 YARDS. &gt;&gt; MAN TO MAN COVERAGE IS ALWAYS A GAMBLE. HUNTER JUST GETS OPEN. &gt;&gt; AND YOU GO OUT THERE, TAKE OFF, I'M GOING TO HIT YOU DOWN THE SIDELINE. A GREAT CALL BY KEN WHISENHUNT. GOT THE RIGHT COVERAGE. TERRIBLE COVERAGE BY BUSTER SCREEN. &gt;&gt; LONGEST CATCH OF JUSTIN HUNTER'S CAREER. HIS FIRST TOUCHDOWN OF THE SEASON. FIRST TIME IN CHARLIE WHITEHURST'S CAREER HE'S THROWN TWO TOUCHDOWNS IN A GAME. AND TENNESSEE HAS A 28-3 LEAD. SCORED MORE POINTS IN THIS SECOND QUARTER THAN THEY DID IN THE PREVIOUS SIX QUARTERS COMBINED. AND THEY ALREADY HAVE TWO 85 YARDS OF OFFENSE AGAINST MIKE PETTINE'S DEFENSE. &gt;&gt; I'LL TELL YOU, NOT THAT THIS IS ALL BRIAN HOYER'S FAULT, BUT IF THIS CLEVELAND BROWNS OFFENSE DOESN'T GET GOING -- NOW THEY HAVE A CUFF FOR THE DEFENSE THAT IS PLAYING SO POORLY. &gt;&gt; YEAH. LISTEN, I'M NOT SUGGESTING ANYTHING HERE AT ALL, BUT THIS MIGHT BE THE OPPORTUNITY THAT MIKE PETTINE IS LOOKING FOR IN THE SECOND HALF. IF THERE'S ANY LIFE OUT OF CLEVELAND ON THIS DRIVE, YOU HAVE TO COME OUT WITH HOYER. HE'S SHOWN THAT HE CAN BRING THE GAME BACK. THE GAME IS NOT OVER. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN MAY JOHNNY MANZIEL IF HE CAN PLAY CORNERBACK. THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THE BROWNS HAVE TO DO A BETTER JOB ON THIRD DOWN. THAT IS HOYER. &gt;&gt; I'M JUST SAYING, COME INTO THE CONVERSATION IF THEY DON'T GET SOMETHING ON THIS DRIVE. LISTEN, IT'S A MESS RIGHT NOW. THEY'RE PLAYING SO POORLY DEFENSIVELY AGAINST A TITAN TEAM THAT COULDN'T SCORE POINTS AND AGAINST A TITAN DEFENSE THAT COULDN'T STOP ANYBODY. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. GIVING UP 30 POINTS IN THREE STRAIGHT GAMES. &gt;&gt; TRAVIS BENJAMIN FROM THE GOAL LINE. TRYING TO PROVIDE A SPARK FOR THE BROWNS. AND HE GETS TO THE 25 YARD LINE. LATE FLAG ON THE FIELD. RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE BROWNS BENCH. PUTS THEM INSIDE THEIR 20. &gt;&gt; DURING THE RETURN, HOLDING. RETURN TEAM, NUMBER 24, TEN-YARD PENALTY, FIRST DOWN CLEVELAND. &gt;&gt; HOW ABOUT CHARLIE WHITEHURST OFF THE BENCH? TWO TOUCHDOWNS. &gt;&gt; TWO TOUCHDOWNS, 86 YARDS. I CAN'T DO THE MATH THAT QUICKLY. TWO REALLY GOOD THROWS SHOWING HE'S READY TO PLAY. THAT'S THE QUALITY YOU WANT IN YOUR BACKUP QUARTERBACK. &gt;&gt; THAT 75 YARD TOUCHDOWN WAS A LIGHTNING BOLT IN THIS BUILDING. &gt;&gt; THE MOST POINTS THE TITANS HAVE SCORED IN A GAME THIS YEAR. STILL 2:38 TO GO IN THE SECOND QUARTER. HOYER HITS A HE THROWS. BENJAMIN MAKES THE CATCH. THEY'RE SAYING HE WAS INBOUNDS. CAMERON WEMBLEY HIT HOYER. &gt;&gt; THAT IS A GREAT THROW. A HIT UNDER PRESSURE. A LINEMAN IN YOUR FACE. HE HAD THIS UP ON TIME AND ON THE MONEY. &gt;&gt; THIS IS CROWELL ON THE CARRY. HE GETS MAYBE A YARD ON THE PLAY. MORGAN MAKES THE TACKLE. CLEVELAND HAS THE TWO-MINUTE WARNING AND TWO TIME-OUTS THE REST OF THE WAY. THEY'RE GOING TO TRY TO GET A PLAY OFF BEFORE THE TWO-MINUTE WARNING AND MAXIMIZE THEIR OPPORTUNITY TO GET DOWN THE FIELD. PLAY ACTION ON SECOND AND 8. HOYER TO THE FULLBACK. HE'S GOT THE FIRST DOWN. FIRST CATCH THIS SEASON FOR THE ROOKIE RAY &gt;&gt; OFF THE BYE, IT'S BEEN A BRUTAL FIRST HALF FOR MIKE PETTINE AND THE CLEVELAND DEFENSE. RIGHT NOW IT'S THE OFFENSE TRYING TO PUT SOME POINTS ON THE BOARD. THEY TRAIL 28-3. TWO TIME-OUTS REMAINING FOR THE BROWNS. HOYER WITH TIME. THROWS. THAT IS CAUGHT BY MILES AUSTIN. A LATE FLAG COMES IN. &gt;&gt; THIS IS GOING AGAINST THE SECONDARY OF THE TITANS. IT'S DECLINED AFTER THAT PLAY. MILES AUSTIN WITH A GREAT CATCH. &gt;&gt; PASS INTERFERENCE. DEFENSE. 32. FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; AUSTIN WORKING AGAINST HARRIS IN THE SECONDARY. AUSTIN CAUGHT THAT BALL OFF THE BACK OF HIS OWN KNEE. THAT WAS A SPECTACULAR CATCH. TRULY -- HOYER DID A GREAT JOB IDENTIFYING THE ONE-ON-ONE COVERAGE. THAT WAS BODY CONTROL AT ITS FINEST. MILES AUSTIN, AN INCREDIBLE CATCH. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT THE BROWNS NEED. THEY NEED SOMEBODY TO STEP UP AND MAKE A PLAY. &gt;&gt; A 31-YARD GAIN. FIRST AND 10 FROM THE 25. TATE. AT THE 20. AND IT WILL BRING UP SECOND DOWN. TACKLE MADE BY SENSABAUGH. HERE'S THE CATCH BY AUSTIN. &gt;&gt; AUSTIN SEES THIS, SPINS AROUND. CATCHES THAT DOWN LOW OFF HIS BACK HIP. A HARD, HARD CATCH. &gt;&gt; FIRST TIME TODAY THE BROWNS HAVE ENTERED THE RED ZONE. IT'S TATE AGAIN. THAT'S GOOD FOR A CLEVELAND FIRST DOWN. 1:15 AND COUNTING HERE IN THE SECOND QUARTER. &gt;&gt; HOYER WORKING THE NO-HUDDLE OFFENSE. A VERY PREPARED QUARTERBACK. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT EVERYBODY POINTS TO, HIS ABILITY TO PREPARE AND BE READY FOR THESE SITUATIONS. TATE UP THE MIDDLE. HAS SOME ROOM. BEN TATE STILL GOING. HE'S TAKEN DOWN AT THE 1. A 13-YARD GAIN FOR BEN TATE. FIRST AND GOAL CLEVELAND. &gt;&gt; GREAT CALL BY KYLE SHANAHAN RIGHT THERE. TO GO WITH THE DRAW PLAY IN THAT SITUATION. THE CLOCK RUNNING DOWN. OBVIOUSLY CAUGHT TENNESSEE TITANS TOTALLY OFF GUARD. I THINK BEN TATE SHOULD HAVE FOUND HIS WAY IN THE END ZONE THERE. &gt;&gt; THE SMART THING THEY'RE DOING HERE, LETTING THE CLOCK RUN. NOT USING THEIR TIME-OUTS. WANT TO SCORE ON THE FINAL PLAY OF THE HALF AND KICK THE EXTRA POINT. &gt;&gt; FIRST AND GOAL. TATE. STACKED UP. DOESN'T GET THERE. NOW CLEVELAND WILL CALL A TIME-OUT WITH 16 SECONDS REMAINING. &gt;&gt; COMING UP IN THE &quot;VERIZON HALFTIME REPORT,&quot; JOIN THE GUYS FOR A PREVIEW OF THURSDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL AND ALL OF HIGHLIGHTS FROM TODAY'S ACTION. CLEVELAND DOES HAVE ONE TIME-OUT REMAINING. 16 SECONDS TO GO. A MUST-SCORE FOR THE BROWNS. &gt;&gt; SURE IS. STEVE TASKER SAID, GOING IN 28-10 OFF A TOUCHDOWN IS A HUGE DIFFERENCE. &gt;&gt; PLAY ACTION. HOYER TO THE END ZONE. TOUCHDOWN JIM DRAY. THAT'S A CLUTCH DRIVE BY HOYER AND THE BROWNS. &gt;&gt; GREAT BALL HANDLING BY BRIAN HOYER. THE HARD PLAY ACTION THAT KYLE SHANAHAN IS KNOWN FOR. YOU HAVE TO RESPECT THE RUN. THEY'RE COMMITTED TO IT. THEY'RE RUNNING THE BALL WELL. THIS IS A RUNNING SITUATION WITH TIME-OUTS LEFT. YOU SOLD IT HARD TO THE TENNESSEE TITAN'S DEFENSE AND COMES UP BIG FOR THE CLEVELAND BROWNS. &gt;&gt; DON'T FORGET THE BROWNS GET THE BALL TO START THE SECOND HALF. SO A BIG TOUCHDOWN WITH 12 SECONDS TO GO IN THE SECOND QUARTER. EXTRA POINT BY CUNDIFF IS GOOD. &gt;&gt; INTERESTING. FORTUNATELY OR UNFORTUNATELY, THE CLEVELAND BROWNS HAVE BEEN IN A SIMILAR SITUATION TO THIS WEEK ONE IN PITTSBURGH WHEN THEY WERE DOWN AT THE HALF AND HUNG IN THERE AND LOST ON THE LAST PLAY BY A FIELD GOAL. CERTAINLY CLEVELAND HAS BEEN OUTPLAYED AND STRUGGLED DEFENSIVELY, BUT THIS IS A TEAM THAT WILL BATTLE BETWEEN THE OFFENSE AND THEIR ABILITY TO RUN. ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS THAT KEN WHISENHUNT TOLD US ABOUT THIS CLEVELAND TEAM IS HE WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH KYLE SHANAHAN'S COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE TO RUN THE FOOTBALL DOWN BY 24 IN THE SECOND HALF. IT REALLY PAID HUGE DIVIDENDS AND CONTINUE TO DO THAT LATE IN THIS GAME. &gt;&gt; THE QUESTION IS CAN MIKE PETTINE AND HIS OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR, JIM O'NEAL FIND A WAY TO SLOW DOWN THIS TENNESSEE TITAN'S OFFENSE THAT HAS BECOME A JUGGERNAUT. THEY'RE JUST QUITE FRANKLY NOT THAT GOOD. &gt;&gt; AND DOING IT WITH CHARLIE WHITEHURST. TWO TOUCHDOWN THROWS FOR THE BACKUP QUARTERBACK BY TENNESSEE. COULDN'T BE MUCH WORSE FOR CLEVELAND DEFENSIVELY. &gt;&gt; IF THE DEFENSE DOESN'T STEP UP, DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THEY DO ON OFFENSE. &gt;&gt; CUNDIFF KICKS IT DEEP. IT'S A TOUCHBACK. FIRST AND 10 AT THE 20 FOR TENNESSEE. &gt;&gt; CHARLIE WHITEHURST BACK OUT. JAKE LOCKER EARLIER IN THE QUARTER INJURED HIS RIGHT HAND. WENT TO THE LOCKER ROOM. HIS RETURN IS QUESTIONABLE. HOYER HAS GONE 170 ATTEMPTS WITHOUT AN INTERCEPTION. BEUERLEIN WITHOUT THROWING A PICK, GOT A GUESS THERE MR. TASKER? &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW THAT ONE. &gt;&gt; 12 YEARS. &gt;&gt; YEAH. NOT BAD ACTUALLY. &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS IT? &gt;&gt; 119 STRAIGHT. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT. &gt;&gt; THAT WAS BACK IN DECEMBER OF 99. &gt;&gt; I'M RELIEVED. &gt;&gt; A LOT BETTER THAN I EXPECTED. MOST POINTS FOR THE TITANS IN THE FIRST HALF SINCE 2008 WHEN THEY HAD 35 AGAINST DETROIT. THAT'S THE END OF THE FIRST HALF WITH THE SCORE TENNESSEE 28, CLEVELAND 10. WE'LL BE BACK WITH THE &quot;VERIZON HALFTIME REPORT&quot; AFTER THIS MESSAGE AND A WORD FROM YOUR &gt;&gt; WE'RE THROUGH TWO QUARTERS IN NASHVILLE. THE TITANS HAVE A 28-10 LEAD ON THE BROWNS. BACK IN THE BOOTH WITH THE STEVES. BEUERLEIN AND TASKER. I'M ANDREW CATALON. COMING INTO THE GAME, WE TALKED ABOUT THIS, CLEVELAND'S RUN DEFENSE. MIKE PETTINE SAID THEY WORKED THROUGHOUT THE BYE TO TRY TO FIX IT. IT'S STILL BROKEN. TENNESSEE AVERAGED MORE THAN SIX YARDS A CARRY, STEVE TASKER. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT WE'VE SEEN THE FIRST HALF. THE PERSON RUNNING MOST EFFECTIVELY IS JAKE LOCKER. HE RAN FOR TWO TOUCHDOWNS. AND WHEN THAT SWITCHED UP, CHARLIE WHITEHURST THREW FOR TWO TOUCHDOWNS. THE BROWNS DEFENSIVELY ARE A MESS. THE WIDE-OUTS FOR TENNESSEE ARE OUTPLAYING THE CORNERS FOR CLEVELAND'S DEFENSE. HE'S STARTING TO THROW THE FOOTBALL ALL OVER THE FIELD. &gt;&gt; FOR TENNESSEE, THIS HAS BEEN AN ABSOLUTE PERFECT FIRST HALF OF FOOTBALL FOR THEM. COULD NOT HAVE ASKED FOR A BETTER START TO THE GAME. CAME OUT OUT THE BLOCK STRONG. LOCKER RUNNING WELL AND THROWING THE FOOTBALL, A COUPLE OF TOUCHDOWN PASSES FROM CHARLIE WHITEHURST. A GREAT TEAM NOT USED TO PLAYING WELL IN RECENT WEEKS. SO I THINK IF YOU'RE KEN WHISENHUNT, YOU COULDN'T BE HAPPIER THAN WHAT YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU. &gt;&gt; OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT LOCKER INJURED HIS HAND AND HIS RETURN IS QUESTIONABLE. THE WHITE HOUSE STEPPED UP AND DID A GREAT JOB. THERE'S JAKE LOCKER WITH THE SHIRT ON. YOU'D TAKE IT THAT HE'S NOT COMING BACK. WE'RE TOLD HIS RETURN IS QUESTIONABLE. &gt;&gt; THIRD QUARTERBACK FOR TENNESSEE. ZACH METTENBERGER IS NOT ACTIVE. &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU WANT TO SEE IF YOU'RE JAKE LOCKER AND A TENNESSEE TITAN FAN. &gt;&gt; BROWNS GET THE BALL TO START THE SECOND HALF. IT'S A TOUCHDOWN. FIRST AND 10 FROM CLEVELAND FROM THE 20. GUYS, LET ME HEAR YOUR SECOND HALF ADJUSTMENTS. &gt;&gt; IT ALL STARTS QUICK. THE BROWNS HAVE TO START FAST. OFFENSE AND DEFENSE. OFFENSIVELY, DRIVE THE BALL AND GET ANOTHER TOUCHDOWN WOULD BE GREAT. DEFENSIVELY, YOU CAN'T STOP THEM, GET THE BALL LOOSE. &gt;&gt; FOR TENNESSEE, THIS GAME IS GOING EXACTLY THE WAY THEY WANT IT TO GO. KEEP DOING WHAT YOU'RE DOING ON OFFENSE. THE KEY IS TO NOT GIVE UP THE BIG PLAYS. DON'T GIVE CLEVELAND ANY QUICK SCORES OR ANY OPPORTUNITY TO GET THIS GAME A ONE OR TWO SCORE BALL GAME QUICKLY. &gt;&gt; SAW THE HAND WRAPPED UP FOR JAKE LOCKER. HIS RIGHT HAND. HE WATCHES FROM THE SIDELINE. &gt;&gt; HOYER 9 OF 14 FOR 98 YARDS IN THE FIRST HALF. A PLAY ACTION ON FIRST DOWN. HOYER LOOKING DEEP FOR GABRIEL. HE CAN STRETCH THE FIELD AND HE MAKES THE GRAB. TAYLOR GABRIELLE. THE BROWNS START THE SECOND HALF WITH A BANG. &gt;&gt; McCOURTY HAD EXCELLENT COVERAGE. ALL OVER HIM. HE STILL PULLS IT IN. OUT STANDING COVERAGE BUT AN OUTSTANDING CATCH MAKES THE PLAY. WHEN A GREAT JOB BY GABRIEL. &gt;&gt; AND THE ONE THING THEY CAN'T GIVE UP, THE BIG PLAY. HERE IT COMES. &gt;&gt; AND WEST REVERSING. STILL GOING. HE'S TACKLED CLOSE TO A FIRST DOWN, A YARD SHY. THIS ONE GOES FOR 49. THE ROOKIE UNDRAFTED OUT OF ABILENE CHRISTIAN. &gt;&gt; ABOUT THE SAME SIZE AS ANDREW HAWKINS. 5'7.&quot; THESE GUYS CAN MAKE THE PLAYS. LIKE IT. &gt;&gt; NINE YARD PICK UP ON FIRST DOWN. WEST NOWHERE TO GO. HE'S THROWN BACK BY PITOITUA. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED IF YOU'RE THE TENNESSEE TITANS RIGHT NOW. YOU'VE GIVEN UP A BIG PLAY COMING OUT AND A SOLID RUN PLAY OR FIRST DOWN BY THE CLEVELAND BROWNS. AT SOME POINT YOU HAVE TO MAKE A STAND AND GET YOUR INTENSITY BACK. TATE CARRYING THE BULK OF THE LOAD. &gt;&gt; CLEVELAND WAS 1 FOR 5 ON THIRD DOWNS IN THE FIRST HALF. FACED WITH A THIRD AND 3 HERE. HOYER, THREE STEP DROP. IN THE DIRECTION OF ANDREW HAWKINS. &gt;&gt; HE THREW THAT EARLY. HAWKINS RAN THAT ROUTE TO THE CORNER OF THE END ZONE. HAWKINS WASN'T LOOKING EARLY ENOUGH. YOU CAN SEE HARRIS HAD HIS WELL-COVERED. HOYER THREW THAT LOOKING FOR HELP FROM THE RECEIVER. THE RECEIVER WAS PRESIN'T LOOKI THE QUARTERBACK. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, STEVE, THAT SOMETIMES THE RECEIVERS AND THE QUARTERBACKS ARE NOT ON THE SAME PAGE. &gt;&gt; CUNDIFF'S SEASON LONG IS 39. THIS IS 42. CUNDIFF DRILLS IT. S THE BIG PLAY TO GABRIEL, BUT THE DRIVE &gt;&gt; CLEVELAND WITH AN EARLY FIELD GOAL HERE IN THE THIRD QUARTER. IT'S NOW A 28-13 LEAD. IT WAS GABRIEL WITH THE BIG PLAY FOR 49 YARDS. &gt;&gt; THAT'S SIGNIFICANT. BOTH STEVE TASKER AND I MADE THE POINT THAT A SCORE WAS IMPORTANT ON THE FIRST DRIVE OF THE SECOND HALF. MAKE IT A TWO-SCORE GAME. CLOSE THE GAP. THIS CLEVELAND BROWNS TEAM IS HAPPY GETTING ON THE BOARD. &gt;&gt; WASHINGTON WILL RETURN THIS ONE. HE'S TACKLED AT THE 10 YARD LINE. GREAT PLAY BY TANK CARTER. THE THIRD YEAR PLAYER OUT OF TCU. LET'S GO BACK TO THE SECOND QUARTER. THIS WAS THE INJURY BY JAKE LOCKER. WATCH HIS FOLLOW-THROUGH. HITS THE HELMET OF BUSTER SKRINE. YOU CAN SEE THE TRAINING STAFF DEALING WITH HIS RIGHT HAND. LAST WEEK IT WAS THE RIGHT WRIST. NOW IT'S HIS HAND THAT IS TAPED UP. YOU CAN SEE IT GOES AROUND HIS THUMB. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE WHACKED OFF OF THE FOREHEAD OF BUSTER SKRINE. AS A FORMER QUARTERBACK, I KNOW WHAT THAT IS LIKE. THERE'S NOTHING MORE PAINFUL THAN THAT. HE'S PLAYING SO WELL AND TO HAVE IT COME TO AN END LIKE THAT IS BAD LUCK. CHARLIE WHITEHURST LOOKING FOR WASHINGTON AND HE MAKES THE CATCH. NOW THEY'RE SAYING INCOMPLETE. WASHINGTON CLAIMS HE BROUGHT IT DOWN. TRYING TO TELL KEN WHISENHUNT THAT HE HAD IT. &gt;&gt; LOOKED LIKE HE HAD IT. MUST HAVE COME LOOSE WHEN HE CAME TO THE GROUND. &gt;&gt; NO, NO. YOU HAVE TO FINISH THAT PROCESS. THAT IS NOT EVEN CLOSE. BY THE RULE, THAT IS NOT A CATCH. &gt;&gt; A BAD RULE, BY THE WAY. I THOUGHT HE HAD IT TWO OR THREE STEPS. &gt;&gt; SANKEY ON SECOND AND 10. NOT MUCH DOING. JOE HAYDEN MAKES THE TACKLE FOR THE BROWNS. HOW ABOUT THE TITANS IN THE FIRST HALF? THEIR DRIVES. THE FIRST DRIVE RESULTED IN A PUNT. BUT THEN IT WAS FOUR STRAIGHT TOUCHDOWNS BEFORE THEY TOOK A KNEE TO RUN OUT THE CLOCK AND END THE HALF. &gt;&gt; THOSE ARE ALL THE DRIVES ABOVE THE LINE. THE ONE BELOW THAT, THE TD. THAT CHARLIE WHITEHURST THREW. &gt;&gt; HE CAME IN AND FINISHED THAT DRIVE TO JAKE LOCKER. &gt;&gt; AND NOW IT'S THIRD AND 8 FOR TENNESSEE. WORST TEAM IN THE LEAGUE ON THIRD DOWN. BUT TEAM THEY'RE FOUR OUT OF FIVE. WHITEH WHITEHURST. THAT IS CAUGHT BY WASHINGTON FOR A FIRST DOWN. 19 YARD GAIN FOR THE VETERAN, NATE WASHINGTON. &gt;&gt; THAT'S TOO EASY. THE RIGHT PLAY CALL FOR THE RIGHT TIME. KEN WHISENHUNT GOT THE COVERAGE HE WAS LOOKING FOR. HE HAD ONE-ON-ONE ON THE OUTSIDE. WASHINGTON JUST ABSOLUTELY SPINS THE DEFENDER AROUND. THAT WAS STAFFORD. &gt;&gt; AND THEY DO BACK TO THE GROUND WITH SANKEY. WE GO BACK TO NEW YORK. J.B. AND BOOMER. &gt;&gt; COLTS LOOKING TO MAKE IT THREE STRAIGHT. &gt;&gt; THIS ONE FOR STEVE BEUERLEIN. TO THE TIGHT END. EASY TOUCHDOWN. 13-3. INDY UP BY 10. &gt;&gt; HE'S DONE THAT QUITE A BIT. ANDREW AND STEVE TASKER AND STEVE BEUERLEIN. &gt;&gt; THE OLD WIDE HIGH. CAN'T STOP IT. &gt;&gt; KIRKSEY MAKES THE TACKLE ON SANKEY. GOOD FOR A TENNESSEE FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; I WAS INCORRECT ON THE PLAY FOR WHITEHURST. YOU GET THE WHY HIDE PLAY THAT WE JUST SAW, WE HAD ONE OF THOSE TODAY. THAT WAS THE TOUCHDOWN BY THE CLEVELAND BROWNS. &gt;&gt; IT WAS THE DELAYED PLAY. THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; INSIDE HAND-OFF. SANKEY ON THE CARRY. GETTING THROWN BACK. A LATE FLAG THAT COMES IN IN THE CLEVELAND SECONDARY. FLAG IS DOWN AT THE CLEVELAND 43. &gt;&gt; THIS IS GOING AGAINST TENNESSEE. &gt;&gt; AFTER THE PLAY, PERSONAL FOUL. UNNECESSARY ROUGHNESS. LATE HIT. OFFENSE. NUMBER 67. 15-YARD PENALTY. IT'S SECOND DOWN. &gt;&gt; ON ANDY LEVITRE. THAT WAS A CHEAP SHOT. &gt;&gt; IT WAS. A PAY BANK SHOT. LEVITRE HAS BEEN IN THE LEAGUE SIX YEARS. THEY HAVE THAT NUMBER MARKED. &gt;&gt; THEY HAD THAT CONVERSATION IN THE LOCKER ROOM AT HALF TIME. NOT WITH THE COACHES. THE LINEMEN GOT TOGETHER AND SAID, LET'S SEND A MESSAGE. THAT WAS THE MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE TO BE SMART, TOO. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE RIGHT. IT'S A CHEAP SHOT. &gt;&gt; AND KEN WHISENHUNT I LIKE THE ATTITUDE, STICKING UP FOR YOUR QUARTERBACK. BUT DO IT BEFORE THE WHISTLE. WE'LL GET GOOD CLEAN LEGAL SHOTS TO MAKE OUR POINT. DON'T HURT THE TEAM TRYING TO MAKE A POINT. &gt;&gt; INJURY UPDATE FOR CLEVELAND. PHIL TAYLOR WILL NOT RETURN WITH A KNEE INJURY. THIRD QUARTER, SECOND AND 23. WHITEHURST OVER THE MILE. CAUGHT BY THE TIGHT END, CHASE COFFMAN. &gt;&gt; WE WERE JUST TALKING DURING THE BREAK. STEVE BEUERLEIN AND I. WHAT DO YOU DO IF YOU'RE KEN WHISENHUNT? YOU HAVE A BIG DEAL. YOU DON'T WANT TO ROLL THE DICE AND GO FOR EVERY OPPORTUNITY. BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO TURN YOUR MOTOR OFF. YOU START GETTING PENALTIES ON A DRIVE LIKE THIS, A PARTIAL FOUL PENALTY, THIRD AND 13 AND NOT LOOKING LIKE A GOOD SITUATION AHEAD OF YOU. &gt;&gt; TENNESSEE HAS TO GET TO THE CLEVELAND 45 FOR A FIRST DOWN. THEY DO BACK TO THE TIGHT END, COFFMAN. HE'S SHORT OF THE FIRST DOWN. TACKLED CLOSE TO MIDFIELD, A GOOD JOB BY THE BROWNS DEFENSE. AIDED BY THE PENALTY AGAINST LEVITRE. &gt;&gt; WITHOUT THE PENALTY, THAT'S A FIRST DOWN. THAT SIMPLE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY WE SAID IN THE FIRST HALF WHEN WE THOUGHT THIS SITUATION WOULD COME ABOUT ABOUT GETTING YOUR SHOTS IN. THE BEST WAY TO GET REVENGE IS TO PLAY WELL AND SCORE POINTS AND BEAT THEM. NOT BY SENDING A MESSAGE IN A PHYSICAL WAY. BY PLAYING BETTER AND SCORING POINTS. &gt;&gt; THE SECOND PUNT TODAY FOR BRETT KERN. HOYER BACK DEEP TO THE BROWNS. HOYER DRIFTING TO HIS RIGHT. AT THE 12. HE GOES OUT-OF-BOUNDS CLOSE TO THE 20 YARD LINE. A LATE HIT COMES IN. FLAGS DOWN ON THE FIELD. &gt;&gt; THAT'S ANOTHER DUMB PENALTY ON THE TENNESSEE TITANS. THERE'S NO EXCUSE FOR THIS KIND OF A PLAY. &gt;&gt; THAT'S ON THE LONG SNAPPER. BO BRINKLEY. NOW KEN WHISENHUNT IS IN HIS FACE. &gt;&gt; WE'VE SEEN THAT FROM KEN WHISENHUNT A COUPLE TIMES. KEN WHISENHUNT IS ONE OF THE MOST CONFRONTATIONAL HEAD COACHES THAT YOU'LL GET. HE TALKS TO HIS PLAYERS EYE TO EYE. PULLS NO PUNCHES. WHEN HE'S UPSET, THEY KNOW IT. A LOT OF PLAYERS RESPOND TO THAT. SOME DON'T. IF YOU DON'T RESPOND TO IT, YOU WON'T BE ON KEN WHISENHUNT'S TEAM. &gt;&gt; ILLEGAL BLINDSIDE BLOCK. WE HAVE A PERSONAL FOUL, LATE HIT OUT-OF-BOUNDS BY THE DEFENSE. BY RULE, THE PENALTIES WILL BE ENFORCED. FIRST DOWN &gt;&gt; 8:21 TO GO THIRD QUARTER. FIRST AND 10 FOR THE BROWNS AFTER WHAT WAS OFFSETTING PENALTIES ON THE LAST PUNT. HOYER TO THE AIR ON FIRST DOWN. THROWS ON THE RUN. ALONG THE SIDELINE, THE PASS IS INCOMPLETE. LOOKING FOR MILES AUSTIN. &gt;&gt; ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK AS A QUARTERBACK, YOU TELL ME, STEVE BEUERLEIN, MOVE THE QUARTERBACK OUT OF THE POCKET, USE THE PLAY ACTION AND GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO SEE THE FIELD. CUTS THE FIELD IN HALF SO YOU DON'T HAVE SO MUCH TO READ. &gt;&gt; IT'S USUALLY A CLEAN READ IF YOU'RE DOING THE BOOTLEG. YOU TAKE IT. IF NOT, YOU THROW IT AWAY AND GO TO THE NEXT PLAY. &gt;&gt; SECOND AND 10. CAN'T BRING IT IN. BERNARD POLLARD ON THE COVERAGE FOR THE TITANS. &gt;&gt; CAMERON HAS TO MAKE THIS PLAY. HE HEARD FOOT STEPS AND WORRIED ABOUT THE HIT. THAT POPPED OUT. GOOD JOB BY POLLARD. CAMERON GOT THAT BIG BODY. &gt;&gt; CLEVELAND 1 FOR 6 ON THIRD. THIRD AND 10. HOYER HAS IT. CAUGHT AT THE 40 BY GABRIEL. A FIRST DOWN FOR THE BROWNS. &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE PLAY THAT FLIES IN THE FACE OF PEOPLE THAT SAY THAT HOYER IS A GAME MANAGER. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE ABOUT IT? WHO HE THREW IT TO. HE'S NOT GOING WITH THE READ, NOT HIS FAVORITE RECEIVER. HERE'S GABRIEL AN UNDRAFTED FREE AGENT. HE GIVES HIM A CHANCE TO MAKE THE PLAY AND HE DOES IT. &gt;&gt; PITCH TO TATE. HE GETS AWAY FROM WILLIAMSON. STILL ON HIS FEET. WE SPIN OUR WAY BACK TO NEW YORK WITH J.B. AND BOOMER. &gt;&gt; WHO IS ON TOP? &gt;&gt; HOW ABOUT THE TAMPA BAY BUCS. 24 UNANSWERED POINTS. HERE'S THE TOUCHDOWN RIGHT HERE. INTERCEPTION FROM DREW BREES. IF SECOND RETURN FOR LANSETTA. HE TAKES IT BACK. 24-14, TAMPA BAY OVER NEW ORLEANS IN THE DOME. &gt;&gt; ANDREW AND STEVE. &gt;&gt; COME ON, J.B. I DON'T KNOW THAT FEELING. I NEVER THREW INTERCEPTIONS LIKE THAT. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN SEE THE TAMPA BAY NEW ORLEANS GAME. THE MORE WE WATCH FOOTBALL, THE LESS WE CAN PREDICT WHAT HAPPENS. &gt;&gt; YOU ALMOST -- THAT WOULD BE AS SURE A BET YOU COULD TAKE TAKING NEW ORLEANS AT HOME OVER TAMPA BAY. &gt;&gt; A GREAT LEAGUE. GOT TO LOVE IT. &gt;&gt; ISAIAH CROWELL WITH A RUN OF 11 TO GET A FIRST DOWN. FIRST AND 10. AND NOT MUCH DOING THIS TIME. &gt;&gt; WOODS MAKES THE STOP. &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE PLAY THEY HAVE RUN TWICE TO THE LEFT SIDE OF THE OFFENSIVE LINE. THIS TIME THEY TRY TO RUN IT TO THE RIGHT WITH CROWELL. THE TITANS SHUT IT OFF. THAT'S ONE OF THE WEIRD THINGS ABOUT FOOTBALL. ONE WAY YOU RUN IT ONE DIREC DIRECTION. SHOULD BE A MIRROR IMAGE ON THE OTHER SIDE. THE DEFENDERS SAW IT AND SNAPPED IT OFF. &gt;&gt; YOU TRY TO PLAY TO THE STRENGTHS. &gt;&gt; ON SECOND AND 9, HOYER FIRES. CAUGHT BY DRAY. HE HAS A FIRST DOWN AT THE 10 YARD LINE. &gt;&gt; THIS IS ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE BOOTLEGS. HE KNOWS HE'S OPEN. INSTEAD OF RUNNING INTO COVERAGE, HE SITS DOWN AND GETS HOYER HIS NUMBERS AND SAYS HEY, I'M OPEN. PUT IT ON ME. &gt;&gt; A BIG PLAY. &gt;&gt; A HEADSY PLAY BY THE TIGHTEND. HARD TO DO AFTER YOU'VE SAT DOWN. &gt;&gt; PITCH IT TO CROWELL. HE GETS ACROSS THE 25 YARD LINE WITH 5:15 TO GO IN THE THIRD QUARTER. NO DOUBT THAT IT'S CLEVELAND OUT OF THE LOCKER ROOM WITH A BOUNCE IN THEIR STEP. &gt;&gt; UP TEMPO. &gt;&gt; RUNNING THE OFFENSE HERE. TRYING TO KEEP THE MOMENTUM GOING ON SECOND AND 5. BACK TO TATE. AND THE SAFETY COMES UP TO MAKE THE TACKLE. THIRD DOWN. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN SEE HOW SIGNIFICANT THAT SCORE BEFORE THE HALF WAS FOR CLEVELAND. THEY GO INTO THE LOCKER ROOM WITH A DIFFERENT ATTITUDE. THEY COME BACK WITH A MENTALITY OF HEY, WE GOT IT GOING NOW. TENNESSEE HASN'T DONE ANYTHING TO CHANGE THAT MOMENTUM YET. THIS IS HEADING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION FOR THE TENNESSEE TITANS. &gt;&gt; YOU DO ONE OF TWO THINGS. YOU MOVE HOYER OUT OF THE POCKET, THROW IT OR YOU MIGHT THROW THE SCREEN PASS TO TRY TO CATCH TENNESSEE BRINGING SOME PRESSURE. FOURTH DOWN AND 3. HOYER OVER THE MIDDLE TO CAMERON. A LOT OF CONTACT THERE. NO CALL. THE COVERAGE WAS BY ADRIAN WILLIAMSON. &gt;&gt; THAT'S BECAUSE IT WAS WITHIN FIVE YARDS. THIRD AND 3. CAMERON GOES TO THE STICK. THEY JUMP HIM. THEY MUG HIM. WILLIAMSON IS ALL OVER HIM. WRAPS HIM AROUND AND HIM AND THE BALL GOES BY. &gt;&gt; THEY CAN MAKE THE CONTACT BUT THAT CAN BE PASS INTERFERENCE AS WELL. &gt;&gt; IF THE BALL IS IN THE AIR. &gt;&gt; WE HAVE A FOURTH DOWN HERE NOW. CLEVELAND IS 2 FOR 2 ON FOURTH DOWNS THIS YEAR. FOURTH AND 3. HOYER FIRES. INCOMPLETE. SENSABAUGH MAY HAVE GOTTEN A HAND ON THAT ONE. HOYER WAS HOOKING &gt;&gt; TV'S NUMBER 1 COMEDY, &quot;THE BIG BANG THEORY&quot; NEW NIGHT. CBS ON MONDAY NIGHT. HAYDEN IS OUT THERE ON THE FIRST DOWN PLAY. &gt;&gt; THAT WAS SHONN GREENE ON THE CARRY. ROBERTSON MAKES THE TACKLE. WE'LL KEEP OUR EYE ON JOE HAYDEN. WE HAVE ALREADY TOLD YOU PHIL TAYLOR IS OUT WITH A KNEE INJURY. &gt;&gt; THAT WAS A STATEMENT RUN BY THE TITANS. LEFT SIDE, OVER THE BACK OF YOUR VETERAN OFFENSIVE LINEMEN. EIGHT YARD GAIN DOING NOTHING BUT SAYING WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THIS RIGHT AT YOU. &gt;&gt; JAKE LOCKER WITH A RIGHT HAND INJURY. McCLUSTER ON SECOND AND ONE GOING TO WRONG WAY. THE BROWNS THROW HIM BACK FOR A LOSS. IT'S THIRD DOWN. &gt;&gt; AND THIS IS A PLACE RIGHT NOW WHERE THE CLEVELAND BROWNS AND THEIR DEFENSE COULD PARTICULARLY MAKE A HUGE STEP FORWARD. IF THEY CAN GET THE TITANS OFF THE FIELD ON THIS THIRD DOWN AND GET A THREE AND OUT, THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DO THE ENTIRE AFTERNOON. WOULD COME AT THE PERFECT TIME. &gt;&gt; VERY QUIET HERE IN NASHVILLE. THIRD AND 2. AND WE HAVE MOTION. A FLAG. A FALSE START AGAINST TENNESSEE. &gt;&gt; FALSE START, OFFENSE, NUMBER 67. &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S ON LEVITRE. HE SAID HE HASN'T BEEN PLAYING WELL. KEN WHISENHUNT SAID THAT LEVITRE REALLY NEEDS TO IMPROVE. &gt;&gt; YOU SAW THE FLINCH THERE. &gt;&gt; THE JUMP. &gt;&gt; THIRD AND 2 TURNS INTO THIRD AND 7 FOR THE TITANS WITH 2:45 TO GO THIRD QUARTER. &gt;&gt; SOME TALK THIS WEEK THAT MAYBE TAYLOR LEWAN WOULD GET A RUN AFTER LEFT GUARD. &gt;&gt; AND CHARLIE LEIGHTER HAS TO BE CAREFUL. &gt;&gt; AND TACKLED SHORT OF A FIRST DOWN BY BRYANT. &gt;&gt; WHAT A HUSTLE PLAY BY BRYANT. RUSHING THE PASSER. SEES THE BALL COMES OUT, TURNS AND PURSUES THE RECEIVER MAKING THE CATCH. HE'S IN THE PASS RUSH. SEES THE PASS COME OUT. HE MAKES THE TACKLE. WHAT AN OUTSTANDING HUSTLE PLAY BY THE BIG GUY. WOW! &gt;&gt; ALL EFFORT. IF HE'S NOT PURSUING THAT, KENDALL BROWN GETS THE FIRST DOWN EASY. &gt;&gt; AND NOW THE THIRD PUNT. &gt;&gt; HE DROPS IT. HE'S HAD A LOT OF PROBLEMS THIS YEAR. TENNESSEE RECOVERS! BENJAMIN MUFFED THE PUNT AGAINST BALTIMORE. AND THAT IS THE FIRST TURNOVER THIS SEASON BY THE CLEVELAND BROWNS. &gt;&gt; WELL, BEFORE THE BYE WEEK, CLEVELAND LOST TO THE BALTIMORE RAVENS. I THOUGHT THEIR SPECIAL TEAMS WAS THE REASON WHY. THEY MISSED A FIELD GOAL OFF THE UPRIGHT. THEY MUFFED A PUNT. AT THE END OF THE GAME, BENJAMIN LEFT ONE GO ON THE FINAL DRIVE WHEN ALL THEY NEEDED WAS TO GET A FIRST DOWN. SET UP A PUNT THAT THE RAVENS GOT AT MIDFIELD. A FIRST DOWN LATER A BIG PLAY LATER, THEY LOSE IT ON THE LAST PLAY BY A FIELD GOAL. THEY HAD TWO FIELD GOAL MISSED OPPORTUNITIES AGAINST BALTIMORE THAT CRUSHED THEM. &gt;&gt; UNSPORTSMAN-LIKE CONDUCT ON THE KICKING TEAM. DID NOT MAKE AN IMMEDIATE ATTEMPT TO RETURN BACK INTO THE FIELD OF PLAY, A 15-YARD PENALTY ASSAYED ON THE PREVIOUS SPOT AND REPLAY FOURTH DOWN. &gt;&gt; OH, HOLY COW! THE PENALTY WAS ON HUNT. &gt;&gt; THEY'RE SAYING HE WAS KNOCKED OUT-OF-BOUNDS. HE HAS TO MAKE THE EFFORT TO GET BACK ON THE PLAYING FIELD. STEVE TASKER, TELL US HOW IT WORKS. &gt;&gt; RIGHT THERE HE'S OUT-OF-BOUNDS. HE DIDN'T MAKE AN IMMEDIATE ATTEMPT TO GET BACK INBOUNDS. THAT'S A PENALTY CALLED EARLY IN THE PLAN. THESE GUYS ARE SPRINTERS OUT THERE. THEY'RE IN WHAT AMOUNTS TO A STREET FIGHT. HE RELEASED OUTSIDE. PUSHED OUT-OF-BOUNDS. HIS MOMENTUM -- HE WAS MAKING A HARD RIGHT HAND TURN TO TRY TO GET BACK ON THE FIELD. &gt;&gt; LET'S LOOK AT THE WHOLE PLAY. &gt;&gt; RIGHT DOWN HERE IS THE PLAY WE'RE LOOKING AT. HE GETS PUSHED OUT-OF-BOUNDS. HE HAS TO MAKE AN EFFORT TO GET BACK IN. &gt;&gt; THERE IT IS. &gt;&gt; HE RUN TWOS -- 20 YARD WITHOUT MAKING THE EFFORT. A GOOD CALL. A CRUSHER FOR TENNESSEE. &gt;&gt; AND BENJAMIN IS NOT BACK DEEP TO CATCH THIS PUNT. HOYER AT THE 40. HE GETS A YARD. BUT THAT IS A HUGE CALL GOING AGAINST THE &gt;&gt; 28-13 IN FAVOR OF THE TITANS. SATURDAY AT NOON, THE SEC ON CBS KICKS OFF WITH THE BEST GAME FROM THE BEST CONFERENCE. 13th RANKED GEORGIA TAKES ON 24th RANKED MISSOURI AND CONTINUES AT 3:30 WITH A GOOD ONE BETWEEN AUBURN AND MISSISSIPPI STATE RIGHT HERE ON CBS SPORTS. KYLE SHANAHAN IS A GUY YOU KNOW WELL, STEVE BEUERLEIN. WHAT DO YOU THINK HERE FROM THE BROWNS OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR? &gt;&gt; I'VE KNOWN KYLE SINCE HE WAS 5 YEARS OLD. I KNEW HIS DAD IN THE RAIDER DAYS. KYLE IS AN AGGRESSIVE COACH. WE'RE GOING TO SEE A SHOT AFTER THE BIG FIELD POSITION CHANGE THERE. &gt;&gt; FIRST AND 10. TATE RUNNING OUT-OF-BOUNDS AT THE 42 YARD LINE. A LOT OF THE TITANS SAID THIS WEEK THEY EXPECTED TO SEE JOHNNY MANZIEL. THEY SAID THEY THOUGHT WITH A BYE, THAT CLEVELAND WOULD HAVE TIME TO DRAW UP A FEW PLAYS FOR HIM. WE'RE NOT SEEN MANZIEL TO THIS POINT. &gt;&gt; WE WERE TOLD BY MIKE PETTINE THAT THEY ALWAYS HAVE THOSE FEW PLAYS AND THEY DON'T KNOW IF THEY'LL -- NEVER A PRIOR TOY TO SAY HEY, WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. TODAY THEY BELIEVE THEY CAN WIN THIS BALL GAME. &gt;&gt; HOYER THROWS TO HIS LEFT. AND THAT IS CAUGHT BY HAWKINS. GOOD SECOND EFFORT THERE BY THE 5'7&quot; ANDREW HAWKINS. A FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; A SPEED CUT. THE BALL IS ON TIME. A GREAT ROUTE AND A GREAT EFFORT. A GOOD THROW. A SOLID COMPLETION FOR A NICE FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; BEN TATE. HAS A LITTLE ROOM. ANOTHER CLEVELAND FIRST DOWN. HE NEARLY BROKE THAT ONE. COTY SENSABAUGH MAKES THE STOP. &gt;&gt; RIGHT HERE, THEY GOT THE TEMPO GOING. PERFECT SITUATION. A COUPLE POSITIVE PLAYS. LOOK FOR A HARD PLAY ACTION COMING UP. &gt;&gt; TATE HAS 15 CARRIES FOR 96 YARDS. TATE AGAIN TO THE 35 YARD LINE. AND THAT IS THE FINAL PLAY OF THE THIRD QUARTER. WE'LL RETURN TO NASHVILLE AFTER &gt;&gt; START OF THE FOURTH QUARTER IN NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE. 28-13 LEAD. THE BROWNS HAVE BEEN A SECOND HALF TIME SO FAR THIS YEAR AVERAGING 16 POINTS PER GAME IN THE SECOND HALF. THAT'S THE BEST MARK IN THE AFC. THEY NEED SOME POINTS HERE. SECOND AND 7 TO BEGIN THE FINAL QUARTER. TERRENCE WEST AT RUNNING BACK FOR THE BROWNS. &gt;&gt; HOYER FIRES RIGHT. ON THE SIDELINE, THE CATCH IS MADE BY JORDAN CAMERON. WHAT A GRAB RIGHT IN FRONT OF JASON McCOURTY. A PICK UP OF 13. &gt;&gt; WE'VE SEEN HIM HAVE THE BALL FORCED IN TO HIM. ANOTHER FORCE BY HOYER. RIGHT ON THE MONEY. McCOURTY HAS HIS HAND IN THERE. WHAT A GREAT JOB BY CAMERON TO PULL THAT IN. A HUGE PLAY. &gt;&gt; AND RAY HORTON DIALED UP A BLITZ. PICKED UP WELL BY THE CLEVELAND BROWNS. WHAT A GREAT THROW AND CATCH BY HOYER AND CAMERON. &gt;&gt; HOYER HAS 13 COMPLETIONS TO EIGHT DIFFERENT RECEIVERS. FIRST AND 10. ACROSS THE 30. HE COMES CLOSE TO A FIRST DOWN. A PICK UP OF 8 ON THE PLAY. &gt;&gt; AND THE BROWNS' OFFENSIVE LINE DOING A GREAT JOB. 2,400 CONSECUTIVE SNAPS FOR THOSE GUYS. NEVER MISS. THEY HAVE NEVER MISSED A SNAP SINCE THEY BECAME CLEVELAND BROWNS. UNBELIEVABLE. &gt;&gt; IT'S HUGE. IT IS UNBELIEVABLE. &gt;&gt; ON SECOND AND 2. HE'S GOT THE FIRST DOWN TO THE 11 YARD LINE. &gt;&gt; I'LL TELL YOU, IF I'M KEN WHISENHUNT AND THE TENNESSEE TITANS, I DON'T LIKE THE WAY THIS GAME IS GOING. THE CLEVELAND BROWNS HAVE BEEN IN THIS POSITION AS WE'VE SAID BEFORE AGAINST THE PITTSBURGH STEELERS. THEY GET THE MOMENTUM GOING, KYLE SHANAHAN HAS SOME RHYTHM WITH THIS OFFENSE. A VERY PRECARIOUS POINT IN THE BALL GAME FOR TENNESSEE. &gt;&gt; AND TATE BACK IN THE GAME ON FIRST DOWN. DOWN TO THE 4 YARD LINE. BEN TATE OVER 100 YARDS RUSHING. &gt;&gt; AND YOU CAN SEE BY THE MISS IN THE BACKFIELD. THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A NO GAIN OR A MINUS PLAY. AND TATE MAKES WOODYARD MISS. GETS DOWN INSIDE THE 5. &gt;&gt; AND SENSABAUGH ON THE &gt;&gt; BACK IN NASHVILLE. COTY SENSABAUGH JOGGED OFF UNDER HIS OWN POWER. 13:12 IN THE FOURTH QUARTER. SECOND AND 3. THE BROWNS CAN GET A FIRST DOWN WITHOUT SCORING. HOYER THROWS RIGHT. OVER THE HEAD OF ANDREW HAWKINS. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE ONLY SPRINT RIGHT OPTION PLAY THAT THE 49ERS AND JOE MONTANA MADE FAMOUS. EVERY TEAM HAS IT. THE PROBLEM IS ANDREW HAWKINS IS NOT 6'3&quot;. &gt;&gt; A BAD THROW. YOU HAVE TO THROW IT TO THE PYLON SO HE CAN GET IT. &gt;&gt; PERFECT CALL. HAD IT OPEN. HOYER HAS TO PUT IT ON HIM. &gt;&gt; HAS TO PUT IT ON. SENSABAUGH STILL ON THE SIDELINES. THIRD AND 3 FOR CLEVELAND. &gt;&gt; WATCH MILES AUSTIN. HE'S HAD TOUCHDOWNS THE LAST THREE GAMES. &gt;&gt; AND TATE LINED UP AS A RECEIVER. HOYER WITH TIME. RUNNING RIGHT. HE JUST THROWS IT AWAY. GREAT COVERAGE BY TENNESSEE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S A GREAT JOB BY THE TENNESSEE DEFENSE. PRETTY DARN IMPRESSIVE. &gt;&gt; THEY SHOULD BE COVERED AS A THREE-MAN RUSH. NOT BRINGING ANY PRESSURE. HOYER BUYS TIME. LATE, THE LINEBACKER COMES OUT OF COVERAGE. HE MIRRORS HOYER. &gt;&gt; FOURTH AND 3. THEY'RE GOING FOR IT HERE. SECOND TIME TODAY THEY'RE GOING FOR IT ON FOURTH DOWN. THEY CAN GET A FIRST DOWN WITHOUT SCORING. &gt;&gt; IT'S CAMERON OUTSIDE, UP TOP. BIG SIZE ADVANTAGE. &gt;&gt; AND 1 ON THE PLAY CLOCK. THEY HAVE TO CALL TIME-OUT. &gt;&gt; YEAH, THEY HAD TO TAKE THEIR TIME TO MAKE THE DECISION WHETHER THEY WERE GOING FOR IT. WHEN THEY DID DECIDE, THEY RAN OUT OF TIME TO CALL THE PLAY AND EXECUTE IT. &gt;&gt; COMING UP NEXT, THE NFL ON CBS ROLLS ON WHEN THE CHIEFS CHALLENGE THE NINERS OR THE JETS TAKE ON THE CHARGERS. CHECK YOUR LOCAL LISTINGS. &gt;&gt; TENNESSEE IN GENERAL THIS YEAR HAS NOT BEEN A VERY GOOD SAID ZONE TEAM. TIED FOR 28th IN THE NFL. CLEVELAND COMING INTO THIS GAME TIED FOR 12th. ONE OF THE BETTER RED ZONE TEAMS. IT'S BEEN THE EXACT OPPOSITE TODAY. TENNESSEE HAS NOT GIVEN UP THE TOUCHDOWN ON THEIR END OF THE FIELD. &gt;&gt; TATE LINED UP NEXT TO HOYER. FOURTH AND 3. HOYER'S PASS IS BATTED DOWN. IT'S INCOMPLETE. ANOTHER FOURTH DOWN STAND BY THE TENNESSEE DEFENSE. &gt;&gt; AND THIS IS VERY FORTUNATE FOR TENNESSEE THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO GET A HAND ON THE BALL. NOT SURE WHO IT WAS. CAMERON COMING UNDERNEATH. WIDE OPEN, A HUGE PLAY FOR THE TENNESSEE TITAN'S DEFENSE. TI.ME H SDUR NAYHTIG FTBOOLAL ON CBS AND NFL NETWORK. WITH SAMMY HILL, THE SIXTH YEAR PLAYER OUT OF STILLMAN WHO GOT HIS HAND ON THAT TO KNOCK DOWN THE PASS BY BRIAN HOYER. TENNESSEE TAKES OVER DEEP IN ITS OWN TERRITORY. 12:28 TO GO FOURTH QUARTER. GIVE IT TO SHONN GREENE ON FIRST DOWN. NOT MUCH DOING. LET'S DO BACK TO THAT FOURTH DOWN PLAY. WATCH SAMMY HILL. &gt;&gt; HOYER DOES A NICE JOB HERE. WATCH THE PUMP FAKE. THE SLIGHT HESITATION GETS ONE GUY UP OFF THE GROUND. SAMMY HILL WATCHING WITH HIS EYES. THAT IS A GREAT JOB. SUCH AN UNDERRATED SKILL. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT THEY TEACH THOSE BIG BOYS. PUSH THE POCKET. GET TALL. PUT THE HANDS UP AND TAKE AWHY A THROWING LANE. VERY WELL-EXECUTED BY SAMMY HILL. &gt;&gt; NO GAIN ON FIRST DOWN. SECOND AND 10. GREEN. AGAIN, NOT MUCH DOING. KRUGER LEADING THE CHARGE. THIRD AND LONG. TENNESSEE WITHOUT JAKE LOCKER. INJURED HIS RIGHT HAND IN THE SECOND. HAS NOT RETURNED. CHARLIE WHITEHURST CONTINUES TO RUN THE SHOW. THERE YOU CAN SEE LOCKER ON THE TENNESSEE SIDELINE. THE CLEVELAND DEFENSE HAS DONE A GOOD JOB IN THE SECOND HALF. THEY'RE TRYING TO FORCE YET ANOTHER THREE AND OUT. THIRD AND 9 FOR THE TITANS. &gt;&gt; I EXPECT CONSERVATIVE PLAY CALL BY KEN WHISENHUNT WITH HIS BACKUP QUARTERBACK. &gt;&gt; WHITEHURST TO WHITE. CLEVELAND DOES THE JOB AGAIN ON DEFENSE. THEY FORCE TENNESSEE TO PUNT. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN ANTICIPATE THAT THE BROWNS WOULD ALLOW A SHORT COMPLETION AND HAVE HIM COME UP AND MAKE THE TACKLE SHORT OF THE FIRST DOWN. GIVE THE QUARTERBACK WHAT HE'S LOOKING FOR. AN EASY PLACE TO GET RID OF THE FOOTBALL. EXCELLENT DEFENSIVE CALL. EXCELLENT EXECUTION BY THE DEFENSE. THEY'RE PLAYING MUCH, MUCH BETTER THIS SECOND HALF. &gt;&gt; SECOND STRAIGHT THREE AND OUT FORCED BY THE CLEVELAND DEFENSE. AGAIN, IT'S JORDAN HOYER BACK DEEP TO RECEIVE THE PUNT. AND IT'S BLOCKED. CLEVELAND GOT A HAND ON IT. IT WAS TANK CARTER THAT BLOCKED THE PUNT FOR THE BROWNS. &gt;&gt; THAT'S A SAFETY. &gt;&gt; IT'S A SAFETY FOR CLEVELAND. THE SPECIAL TEAMS HAS HAD A BRUTAL START TO THE SEASON. COME UP WITH A BIG PLAY HERE. &gt;&gt; THAT TAKES CARE OF THE TWO-POINT CONVERSION IF THEY WERE TO SCORE TWICE. NOW TWO TOUCHDOWNS, TWO EXTRA POINTS AND THE BROWNS HAVE GOT THE LEAD, NOT JUST A TIE. ON CB YOU BY -- &gt;&gt; THE BROWNS' SPECIAL TEAMS THANKS TO TANK CARTER PUTS TWO ON THE BOARD THANKS TO THE SAFETY. NOW THE FREE KICK BY TENNESSEE. RIGHT UP THE MIDDLE. TACKLED AT THE 33 YARD LINE. WE GO BACK TO THAT BLOCKED PUNT. &gt;&gt; IT'S WELL-DESIGNED. THEY HAVE TANK CARTER IN THE GAP. RIGHT HERE. AND THEN THEY HAVE THREE GUYS OUT HERE THAT WILL RUSH. THE UP BACK TAKES A STEP THE WRONG WAY. WATCH WHAT HAPPENS AS TANK CARTER COMES ACROSS THE CENTER. &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE A GUY LINED UP IN THE GAP OF THE LONG SNAPPER. IT WAS A BRILLIANT DESIGN BY CLEVELAND TO HAVE THOSE THREE GUYS ON THE OUTSIDE. THAT FORCED THE LINE TO SLIDE THAT WAY CREATING A MISMATCH FOR THE LONG SNAPPER. HE COULDN'T GET THERE TO GET THE BLOCK. &gt;&gt; FALSE START NUMBER 75. FIVE YARD PENALTY. FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE FOURTH TEAM IN BRETT KERN'S CAREER HE'S HAD A PUNT BLOCKED. LET'S SEE IF THE BROWNS CAN GET THE MOMENTUM ROLLING. THEY'VE DONE A GOOD JOB IN THE SECOND HALF SPECIFICALLY ON DEFENSE. NOW THEY NEED THE OFFENSE TO PUT POINTS ON THE BOARD. 10:56 TO GO. PLAY ACTION. HOYER HAS TIME. THROWS LEFT. THE CATCH IS MADE AT MIDFIELD. THAT IS GABRIEL WHO BRINGS IT IN. BERNARD POLLARD FORCED HIM OUT. A PICK UP OF 21 FOR GABRIEL. &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHAT PLAY ACTION DOES. HOYER HAS ALL DAY TO LET THE PASS ROUTE DEVELOP. HE CAN KNOCK OFF CHUNK YARDS WITH THE THROWS. &gt;&gt; AND THAT BRINGS UP SECOND DOWN. &gt;&gt; WHAT I MEAN, WHEN YOU MAKE THAT HARD PLAY ACTION, THE LINEBACKERS HAVE TO STEP UP. THE SAFETIES HAVE TO RESPECT THE RUN AS WELL. THAT CREATES A ONE-ON-ONE SITUATION ON THE OUTSIDE WHERE IT'S A CLEAR THROW AND CATCH. QUARTERBACK DREAMS ABOUT THOSE OPPORTUNITIES. &gt;&gt; HOYER TO HAWKINS. BROKEN UP. A FLAG COMES. IN HARRIS GOT THE HAND ON THE BALL. &gt;&gt; YEAH, THIS PENALTY IS BEFORE THE BALL GOT THERE. HARRIS MADE A NICE PLAY WHEN THE BALL GOT THERE. THE CONTACT IS BEFORE THE BALL WENT BY HIM. THE CROWD IS REACTING TO THE END OF THE PLAY WHERE THERE WAS NO CONTACT. &gt;&gt; HOLDING, OFFENSE, NUMBER 84. PRIOR TO THE PASS, ILLEGAL CONTACT. THE PENALTIES OFFSET. REPLAY SECOND DOWN. &gt;&gt; BIG ONE ON CAMERON. WIPES OUT THE PENALTY ON HARRIS. &gt;&gt; LET'S LOOK AT IT. A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PASS INTERFERENCE AND ILLEGAL CONTACT. HE HAS FIVE YARDS. THERE'S THE CONTACT. THAT WAS ABOUT 7 OR 8 YARDS DOWN THE FIELD NO DOUBT, ILLEGAL CONTACT UP THE FIELD. THE FANS DON'T UNDERSTAND THE RULE. THEY DIDN'T SEE THE FULL PLAY. THESE A PENALTY EVERY TIME. HOYER. THAT ONE IS PICKED OFF BY McCOURTY. FLAG IS DOWN IN THE SECONDARY. McCOURTY OFF TO THE RACES. AT THE 30, ONE MAN TO BEAT AND HE'S KNOCKED OUT BY CROWELL AT THE 1. NOW THERE'S MORE PUSHING AND SHOVING AT THE 25 YARD LINE. FLAGS ALL OVER THE FIELD. INCLUDING ONE IN THE VICINITY WHERE McCOURTY PICKED OFF THE PASS. A LOT TO SORT OUT RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; THIS ALL STARTED IN THE FIRST HALF WHEN JAKE LOCKER TOOK A SHOT AFTER HE SCORED A TOUCHDOWN. IT HASN'T LET UP. IT'S REARING ITS HEAD NOW AS ANOTHER BIG PLAY HAPPENS FOR THE TITANS. THEY PICK THIS OFF AND GO DOWN TO THE 1 YARD LINE OF THE CLEVELAND BROWNS. A COMPLETE MISCOMMUNICATION OR A FORCED THROW BY HOYER. I DON'T KNOW WHO HE WAS THROWING THIS TO. HAWKINS MOVES AWAY FROM THE DEFEND. HOYER RELEASES IT. HAWKINS MOVES TO A DIFFERENT SPOT. TURNS INTO A PICK. &gt;&gt; LOOKS LIKE HIS HAND IS JUST BARELY UNDERNEATH THAT. &gt;&gt; AGAIN, HAS TO BE CLEAR TO OVERTURN IT. WE'RE HAVING A PROBLEM DETERMINING WHETHER IT WAS OR NOT. &gt;&gt; WE SPOKE TO MIKE PETTINE. WE KNOW THAT WE CAN'T GO THROUGH AN ENTIRE SEASON. IT'S HOW WE HANDLE IT WHEN IT HAPPENS. THIS IS A TOUGH SPOT TO RECOVER FROM. THAT TURNOVER, THIS WILL TELL HIM A LOT ABOUT WHAT THIS TEAM IS MADE OF. THAT'S A TURNOVER AT THE WORST POSSIBLE MOMENT. &gt;&gt; WE HAVE FOULS BY BOTH TEAMS ON THE PLAY. PRIOR TO THE PASS, WE HAVE ILLEGAL CONTACT. DEFENSE, NUMBER 32. PERSONAL FOUL, UNNECESSARY ROUGHNESS ON THE OFFENSE, NUMBER 73. WE ALSO HAVE A PERSONAL FOUL, UNNESS ROUGH ANY, NUMBER 91. HE'S EJECTED FOR HIS OFFENSE. BY RULE, WE REPLAY SECOND DOWN. &gt;&gt; AMAZING. DERRICK MORGAN IS EJECTED. FOR THE SECOND TIME TODAY, WHEN THE BROWNS THOUGHT THEY HAD TURNED OVER, IT'S A PENALTY THAT CANCELS OUT THE TURNOVER. &gt;&gt; THE ILLEGAL CONTACT, IF YOU'RE TENNESSEE, THAT'S THE BACK BREAKER. THAT NULLIFIES THE INTERCEPTION. EVERYTHING ELSE HAPPENED AFTER THE INTERCEPTION. IT WOULD BE A MOOT POINT. IT WOULD BE TENNESSEE'S BALL. &gt;&gt; THAT PENALTY THAT YOU MENTIONED WAS ON BRANDON HARRIS. MORGAN HAS BEEN EJECTED. HE'S HEADED OUT. HARRIS IS PLAYING NICKEL. THAT'S USUALLY WHERE SENSABAUGH IS AT. NOW SENSABAUGH IS AT CORNER AND HARRIS PLAYING NICKEL. NOW WE GO BACK TO NEW YORK WITH MIKE CAREY. THERE'S A LOT TO DIGEST THERE. &gt;&gt; YES. THIS IS A RARE PLAY HERE. NEGATED BY THE ILLEGAL CONTACT. NO FOUL. THE DEAD-BALL FOULS BECOME LIVE BALL FOULS BECAUSE OF THAT. THEY OFFSET AT THE PREVIOUS SPOT. THE EJECTION SPEAKS FOR ITSELF. &gt;&gt; THAT'S A BACK BREAKER. THE DEFENSIVE PENALTY HAPPENED DURING THE PLAY OBVIOUSLY. THE TWO PENALTIES AFTER THE PLAY OFFSET. IT'S VERY CONFUSING FOR THE NAKED OBSERVER. WE SEE A LOT OF FISTACUFFS IN THERE. WHAT WOULD FORCE A REFEREE TO EJECT A PLAYER? &gt;&gt; HE MUST HAVE DONE SOMETHING EGREGIOUS. HE MUST HAVE TAKEN A SWING OR DOWN SOMETHING THAT WAS REALLY WHAT YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE HAPPEN. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT, MIKE. THANKS VERY MUCH. 8:40 TO GO. FIRST AND 10. TATE. HE GETS 2 ON THE PLAY. SO CLEVELAND IS STILL WITHOUT A TURNOVER THIS SEASON EVEN THOUGH IT LOOKED LIKE TWICE IN THE SECOND HALF THEY HAD TURNED THE BALL OVER ONLY TO GET BAILED OUT BY PENALTIES. BEN TATE HAS 19 CARRIES FOR 117 YARDS. PLAY ACTION. HOYER TO HAWKINS. HE MAKES THE CATCH AT THE 31. RIGHT AT THE LINE. &gt;&gt; THERE'S HAWKINS STOPPING AND MOVING. HE THROWS IT TO THE BACK DEFENDER. THAT WAS THE PICK. &gt;&gt; 32, BRANDON HARRIS DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. THAT'S A LITTLE CONFUSING. MAYBE IT WAS ON McCOURTY. &gt;&gt; McCOURTY IS THE ONLY ONE THAT COULD HAVE BEEN ON. THAT WAS WITHIN 5 YARDS. TENNESSEE GOT THE RAW END OF THAT DEAL. SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN A DEFENSIVE PENALTY UNLESS THERE'S SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED THAT WE DENT SEE. &gt;&gt; BEN TATE, 119 YARDS RUSHING A CAREER HIGH. 7 1/2 TO GO. TATE TO THE 26. WE GO BACK TO NEW YORK. J.B. AND BOOMER. &gt;&gt; ARIAN FOSTER'S MOM SAYS SUCK IT UP AND PLAY, SON. &gt;&gt; TOUCHDOWNS ARE COMING FAST ACROSS THE NFL. FOUR PLAYS, 45 YARD DRIVE TOPPED OFF BY THE FOSTER TOUCHDOWN RUN. GAME TIED 17-17. &gt;&gt; ANDREW, STEVE AND STEVE. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT, GUYS. JIM DRAY HAS A FIRST DOWN RECEPTION. SO CLEVELAND WITH THIS UP TEMPO OFFENSE MOVING THE OFFENSE DOWN THE FIELD. &gt;&gt; IT'S BEEN ALL CLEVELAND OFFENSIVELY FROM THE LAST DRIVE OF THE FIRST HALF THROUGH THIS SECOND HALF. THEY DON'T HAVE A LOT TO SHOW FOR IT BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN STOPPED ON FOURTH DOWN A COUPLE TIMES. THEY REALLY HAVE SOME RHYTHM GOING OFFENSIVELY. &gt;&gt; FIRST AND 10. PLAY ACTION TO CROWELL. HOYER WITH GOOD COVERAGE DOWNFIELD. FIRES WIDE OPEN, TOUCHDOWN! TRAVIS BENJAMIN. HOYER KEPT THE PLAY ALIVE AND THE BROWNS STILL RIDING THE COMEBACK TRAIL. &gt;&gt; WE'VE SEEN HOYER THROW IT AWAY, GUYS BAT BALLS DOWN. HE DOES AN OUTSTANDING JOB. RIGHT IN HIS FACE THAT IS SHAWN PHILLIPS. HE STEPS BACK INSIDE, TOWARDS THE BALL AND FINDS BENJAMIN. HE JUST GOT THAT OFF AS HE RARED BACK TO THROW IT AS HE COCKED HIS ARM. PHILLIPS ALMOST SWIPED IT OUT OF HIS HANDS. HE GOT THE PASS OFF AND TURNED INTO A TOUCH DOWN WHAT A PLAY BY THE CLEVELAND QUARTERBACK. &gt;&gt; SECOND TOUCHDOWN THIS SEASON BE BENJAMIN WHO EARLIER MUFFED THE POINT. THE EXTRA POINT IS GOOD. IT WAS 28-3 AT ONE POINT. BUT THE BROWNS WITH ALL THE MOMENTUM IN THE SECOND HALF. WE'VE GOT A 6-POINT GAME IN &gt;&gt; TAKE A LOOK AT THE BREAKDOWN THIS HALF. 36 PLAYS BY THE BROWNS. JUST 14 FOR TENNESSEE. BROWNS FANS, SOME OF THE BEST IN THE LEAGUE. ONCE AGAIN, THE GAME COMING DOWN TO THE END IN THE FOURTH QUARTER. ALL THREE OF THEIR GAMES SO FAR THIS SEASON HAVE BEEN DECIDED IN THE FINAL SECONDS. AND THIS WILL BE A &gt;&gt; TOMORROW, SEE WHY CRITICS ARE CALLING &quot;SCORPIONS&quot; BRAINY FUN. THAT'S TOMORROW AT 9/8 CENTRAL AFTER &quot;THE BIG BANG THEORY&quot; ONLY ON CBS. LET'S GO BACK TO THE TOUCHDOWN FROM HOYER TO BENJAMIN. &gt;&gt; BENJAMIN IS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN. WHAT HAPPENS, HE HAS BRANDON HARRIS. COMES HERE, COMES BACK. BREAKS CONTAIN. JUST BRANDON HARRIS ENDS UP LOSING HIS FEET. THAT CREATES THE SPACE THAT HOYER NEEDS. BRIGHT JOB BY BRIAN HOYER IN THE BACKFIELD AVOIDING PHILLIPS. PHILLIPS NEEDS TO MAKE THAT PLAY IF YOU'RE TENNESSEE. INSTEAD, A BIG PLAY FOR THE BROWNS. THEY'RE BACK IN THIS BALL GAME. &gt;&gt; 19 UNANSWERED POINTS BY THE BROWNS. TENNESSEE HAS NOT SCORED IN CLOSE TO 26 MINUTES. &gt;&gt; WHITEHURST IN TROUBLE. HE THROWS IT AWAY. COTY SENSABAUGH WITH THE INJURY. &gt;&gt; CHARLIE WHITEHURST, YOU THINK ABOUT IT, YOU SEE JAKE LOCKER ON THE SIDELINES WITH THE HAND INJURY THAT HE SUFFERED IN THE SECOND QUARTER. CHARLIE WHITEHURST, YOU THINK HOW HARD IT IS TO COME OFF THE BENCH. BEUERLEIN, YOU KNOW THIS. NOW HE'S BEEN ON THE BENCH WAITING TO COME BACK IN AFTER THAT ENORMOUSLY LONG CLEVELAND DRIVE. NOW THEY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH COMMUNICATION. &gt;&gt; BROWNS FANS MAKING A LOT OF NOISE HERE IN NASHVILLE. WE SAW A BUNCH OF THEM AT THE CLEVELAND TEAM MOTEL YESTERDAY WAITING FOR THE BROWNS TO ARRIVE. THEY HAVE SHOWED UP IN A BIG WAY. A TIME-OUT CALLED FOR BY TENNESSEE. &gt;&gt; TENNESSEE ONLY HAD 10 GUYS IN THE HUDDLE. CHARLIE WHITEHURST KNEW IT. HE HAD TO WALK OFF. IT WASN'T A COMMUNICATION ISSUE. IT WAS A PERSONNEL ISSUE. &gt;&gt; WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT A LOT ABOUT CHARLIE WHITEHURST AND NUMBER 2 ABOUT HOW MUCH CONFIDENCE KEN WHISENHUNT HAS IN CHARLIE WHITEHURST. THIS GUY, EVEN THOUGH HE'S A NINE-YEAR VETERAN, HE'S NOT BEEN IN THIS POSITION VERY OFTEN. I KNOW. I'VE BEEN THERE. IT'S DIFFERENT. YOU'RE BACKED UP. THEY HAVE MOMENTUM. YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE GUTS TO STAND IN THERE AND MAKE A PLAY RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; WHITEHURST IS IN TROUBLE. HE'S SACKED. ARMONTY BRYANT WITH HIS FIRST SACK OF THE SEASON. &gt;&gt; HERE'S WHAT YOU FORGET ABOUT IN THIS SITUATION, STEVE. YOU'RE NOT ONLY BACK, BUT NOW YOU'RE PLAYING A DEFENSE THAT IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN THE FIRST HALF. THEIR EMOTION IS HIGH. THEY'RE BRINGING HEAT. BELIEVING THAT THEY CAN WIN THE GAME ON THIS SERIES AND YOU HAVE TO STEP IN THERE AND MAKE IT HAPPEN. &gt;&gt; CHARLIE HAS TO BE DECISIVE. HE HAS TIME TO MAKE A THROW. I DON'T KNOW WHO WAS OPEN UP THE FIELD. HE LOOKED VERY INDECISIVE THERE. &gt;&gt; THIRD AND 15 WITH SIX MINUTES TO GO IN THE FOURTH QUARTER. &gt;&gt; WHITEHURST, PASS IS CAUGHT BY WASHINGTON. WELL SHORT OF A FIRST DOWN. AGAIN, THE CLEVELAND DEFENSE FORCE AS THREE AND OUT. &gt;&gt; THIRD STRAIGHT THREE AND OUT BY TENNESSEE ON OFFENSE. &gt;&gt; RIGHT NOW TENNESSEE'S TRYING TO HANG ON. AND CLEVELAND IS PRYING THEIR FINGERS OFF THE BOTTOM RUNG OF THE LADDER. &gt;&gt; AND BASED ON YOUR EXPERIENCE, WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU PLAY TO HANG ON? &gt;&gt; YOU LOSE. &gt;&gt; YOU GET BIT. &gt;&gt; YOU LOSE. &gt;&gt; HOYER IS BACK DEEP. LAST PUNT WAS BLOCKED. THIS IS AWAY. A HIGH KICK. HOYER FROM THE 27. AND HE'S TACKLED BY CLINTON GROVE, THE FORMER BROWN. CLEVELAND HAS ALL THE MOMENTUM AND IT STARTED LATE IN THE SECOND QUARTER WHEN THE BROWNS WERE ABLE TO SCORE BEFORE THE HALF. &gt;&gt; THAT WAS THE KEY. WE TALKED ABOUT IT. GETTING A TOUCHDOWN BEFORE THE HALF. THEN COMING UP IN THE SECOND HALF AND TRYING TO START THIS THING OFF WITH THE POINTS, THE BLOCKED PUNT. TWO POINTS. EVEN THOUGH YOU'VE BEEN STOPPED ON FOURTH DOWN, THE CLEVELAND BROWNS, YOU STILL HAVE ALL THE MOMENTUM. &gt;&gt; TWO TIME-OUTS REMAINING FOR THE BROWNS. FIRST AND 10. HOYER FIRES. DEFLECTED AT THE LINE. INCOMPLETE. &gt;&gt; FOR AS BAD AS IT LOOKED FOR CLEVELAND IN THE FIRST HALF AND THEY GET BACK INTO THIS GAME AND I'D LOOKED REAL BAD IN THE FIRST HALF, JUST LIKE WEEK ONE AGAINST PITTSBURGH WHEN THEY FELL BEHIND. ONE THING YOU HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THIS BROWNS TEAM WITH HOYER AT QUARTERBACK, WHATEVER HAPPENS, THEY NEVER GO AWAY. KYLE SHANAHAN CONTINUES TO RUN THE BALL AND CONTINUE TO GET BETTER THROUGHOUT THE GAME. THEY FIND THEMSELVES WITH A CHANCE TO WIN IT WITH 5:10 LEFT. &gt;&gt; CLEVELAND DOMINATING IN THE SECOND HALF IN TOTAL YARDS. THAT WAS SAMMY HILL THAT KNOCKED DOWN ANOTHER HOYER PASS. NOW THEY SET UP A SCREEN. INCOMPLETE TO BEN TATE. THAT BRINGS UP THIRD AND 10. &gt;&gt; 241 FOR CLEVELAND, 73 YARDS FOR THE TENNESSEE TITANS. RIGHT HERE THEY HAD THE SCREEN PASS SET UP. A LITTLE OUT OF REACH. THAT'S A PLAY THAT TATE HAS TO MAKE. &gt;&gt; IF YOU'RE THE TENNESSEE TITAN DEFENSE, THIS IS IT RIGHT HERE. YOU HAVE KNOCKED OFF THIS OFFENSE THE WHOLE SECOND HALF. THE CROWD IS INTO IT. BACKED UP THIRD AND LONG. YOU CANNOT GIVE UP A CONVERSION HERE. &gt;&gt; THIRD AND 10. ONE ON THE PLAY CLOCK. HOYER STEPS UP. FIRES DEEP DOWN THE RIGHT SIDE AND IT'S PICKED OFF. MICHAEL GRIFFIN. AND THAT IS THE FIRST TURNOVER OF THE DAY AND OF THE YEAR BY THE CLEVELAND BROWNS. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN SAY WHAT YOU WANT, THE PLAY WAS COMING APART. HOYER DIDN'T BELIEVE HE HAD ANYTHING NOTHING BUT A 45-YARD PUNT. &gt;&gt; A GOOD POINT, STEVE. &gt;&gt; IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET IT, THROW IT DOWN THERE. THAT'S A 45 YARD NET PUNT. PUTS THE TENNESSEE TITANS BACK THERE. HOYER TOOK THE SHOT DOWN THE FIELD. GAVE YOUR GUY A CHANCE TO DO IT. YOU SAW THERE, TOUGH TO COP VERT A THIRD AND 10 ANYWAY. &gt;&gt; AS A QUARTERBACK I'M THINKING I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO SEE HIM. GIVE YOUR CHANCE A GUY TO MAKE A PLAY. HE OVERTHREW IT. THE ONLY GUY GOING TO MAKE THAT PLAY IS A DEFENDER BACK THERE. &gt;&gt; SO I AGREE. TAKING A SHOT IN THAT SITUATION. THERE'S STILL FIVE MINUTES IN THE GAME. &gt;&gt; THEY'RE GETTING THE BALL BACK. &gt;&gt; HOYER, 189 PASS ATTEMPTED WITHOUT A PICK UNTIL THAT ONE BY GRIFFIN. CHARLIE WHITEHURST THROWS IT AWAY. EACH TEAM HAS TWO TIME-OUTS REMAINING. THERE'S HOYER. &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT WITH CHARLIE WHITE HEARSE. HE BACKS OUT. HE'S GOT TO STAND STRONG AND MAKE A DECISION. I'M NOT SAYING THERE WAS SOMEBODY OPEN. I'M SAYING HIS BODY LANGUAGE IS SHOWING ME HE'S NOT SURE WHAT HE'S DOING. &gt;&gt; AS SUCCESSFUL AS HE WAS IN THE FIRST HALF, THAT'S AS TIMID HE'S LOOKED HERE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER. &gt;&gt; CHARLIE WHITEHURST FIRES. INCOMPLETE. DANGEROUS PASS. WILLIAMS NEARLY PICKED THAT OFF. &gt;&gt; NOW WE'RE RIGHT BACK TO A POINT WHERE WE'RE THIRD AND 10 FOR THE TITANS. BOTH OF THESE DEFENSES HAVE COMPLETELY TURNED IT AROUND. THE CLEVELAND BROWNS ARE PLAYING WAY DIFFERENT LIKE A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT UNIT THAN THEY WERE IN THE FIRST HALF. &gt;&gt; I'M SURPRISING, TOO, THAT THE TITANS HAVE ABANDONED THE RUNNING GAME. THROWING ON FIRST AND SECOND DOWN HERE. YOU WERE RUN THE BALL SO WELL IN THE FIRST HALF. RIGHT NOW YOU'RE LOOKING AT THIRD AND 10. THERE'S NO TIME KNOCKED OFF THE CLOCK. &gt;&gt; COULDN'T AGREE MORE. THIRD AND 10. WHITEHURST'S PASS IS CAUGHT RIGHT AT THE 6. THAT WILL DEPEND UPON THE SPOT. LOOKS LIKE HE GOT IT. &gt;&gt; THEY COMPLETELY BLEW THE COVERAGE. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DO THIS IN THIS SITUATION. THEY LEAVE -- THEY HAVE THREE RECEIVERS ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE OFFENSIVE FORMATION. THEY LEAVE ONE COMPLETELY UNCOVERED. THE DEFENSE TRYING TO RALLY THERE. DELANIE WALKER IS THE LAST GUY TO LEAVE WITH NOBODY ON HIM. &gt;&gt; HE SHOULD BE THE FIRST GINORMOUS YOU TAKE AWAY. THE BIGGEST THREAT ON THE TITAN'S OFFENSE. &gt;&gt; THE CLOCK TICKS. SANKEY IS STUFFED ON FIRST DOWN. COMING UP TO MAKE THE TACKLE IS DANCE. CLEVELAND WITH TWO TIME-OUTS AND THE TWO-MINUTE WARNING. &gt;&gt; DANSBY WAS SHOUT OUT OF A CANNON THERE. SANKEY HAD NO CHANCE. I STILL WOULD LIKE TO SEE A RUN ON THE SECOND DOWN. YOU KNOW THAT CLEVELAND WILL BE PLAYING PASS. RUN THE FOOTBALL. TRY TO GIVE CHARLIE WHITEHURST AND HIS TEAM A CHANCE TO MAKE A CONVERSION IN THIRD AND LONG. &gt;&gt; TAKING THE PLAY CLOCK DOWN. AND THEY RAN THIS PLAY IN THE FIRST HALF. THIS TIME TUKIRKSEY IS ABLE TO WRAP HIM UP AND BRING HIM DOWN. &gt;&gt; THEY GET TO THE EDGE SO FAST. IT'S DIFFICULT TO KEEP HIM FROM GETTING TO THE SIDELINE. DANSBY OUTSTANDING PLAY TO CATCH THAT. STILL JUST AS YOU SAID, THIRD AND 6 INSTEAD OF A THIRD AND 10. &gt;&gt; A TIME-OUT CALLED FOR BY THE BROWNS WITH 3:12 REMAINING. THEY HAVE ONE TIME-OUT AND THE TWO-MINUTE WARNING HERE TO GO IN THE FOURTH QUARTER. &gt;&gt; I LIKE THE CALL. I LIKE PICKING UP THE SIX YARDS. NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. A TOTALLY DIFFERENT SITUATION FOR YOUR OFFENSE. I DO LIKE MIKE PETTINE USING HIS TIME-OUTS HERE. YOU'RE SHOWING CONFIDENCE WITH YOUR DEFENSE THAT YOU'RE DOING TO GIVE THE BALL BACK TO YOUR OFFENSE WITH A DECENT AMOUNT OF TIME LEFT. &gt;&gt; COMING UP NEXT, KANSAS CITY AND SAN FRANCISCO. AND THE JETS TRAVEL TO SAN DIEGO. BIG PLAY HERE. THIRD AND 6. TENNESSEE 6 FOR 11 ON THIRD DOWN TODAY. WHITEHURST LOOKING SIDELINE. CAUGHT AGAIN BY WALKER AT THE STICK, THIS ONE MIGHT BE A HAIR SHORT. IT'S VERY CLOSE. TENNESSEE INDICATING THEY HAVE IT AND THEY DO. ANOTHER THIRD DOWN CATCH BY DELANIE WALKER. &gt;&gt; I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT. THIS WAS A GOOD SPOT FOR THE TITANS. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT BALL CROSSED BASED ON WHERE THAT STRIPE IS THERE. &gt;&gt; DO YOU CHALLENGE THE SPOT? &gt;&gt; THEY'RE GOING TO DO THAT. &gt;&gt; MIKE PETTINE THROWS THE FLAG. &gt;&gt; THEIR LAST TIME-OUT THEY'RE RISKING IN THIS CHALLENGE. &gt;&gt; I THINK IT'S WORTH IT. &gt;&gt; I THINK IT IS, TOO. IT HAPPENED IN FRONT OF WHERE OUR BOOTH IS. WE BOTH -- I DIDN'T THINK HE GOT IT TO BE VERY HONEST. THE GUY SPOTTED IT. HE WAS WELL PAST THE MARK. SO HE STILL MAY GET IT BUT IT'S CLOSER THAN I THINK THE SPOT INDICATED. &gt;&gt; SO HARD TO DETERMINE WHERE THE BALL WAS WHEN HE STEPPED OUT-OF-BOUNDS. THE BALL WAS ON THE INSIDE OF DELANIE WALKER. &gt;&gt; CLEVELAND IS CHALLENGING THE RULING ON THE FIELD AS RELATING TO A FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; IT WAS A BENEFICIAL SPOT. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN SEE THE RECEIVER HERE. THE BALL IS ON HIS BACK HIP THAT BALL IS A HALF A YARD BACK FROM WHERE THAT STRIPE IS. &gt;&gt; THEY SPOTTED IT PAST THE 43 YARD LINE. &gt;&gt; DOESN'T MATTER WHERE HIS BALL IS. HIS FEET ARE BEHIND THE 43 YARD LINE. THERE'S A DISPARITY TO WHERE HIS FEET COME OUT. THERE'S THE 43 YARD LINE HERE. &gt;&gt; THE BALL NEVER GET BACK THERE. &gt;&gt; ACROSS THE 42. &gt;&gt; THIS IS AN EXCELLENT CHALLENGE. WE'LL SEE IF WHAT WE SEE IS THE WHAT THE OFFICIALS SEE IN THE HOOD. &gt;&gt; DOESN'T MATTER WHERE THE BODY IS. IT'S WHERE THE BALL IS WHEN THE FOOT STEPS OUT. &gt;&gt; THE BALL HAS TO GET THERE BEFORE IT BREAKS THE PLANE. &gt;&gt; FIRST CHALLENGE THIS SEASON BY MIKE PETTINE. &gt;&gt; LET'S WELCOME IN MIKE CAREY IN NEW YORK WHAT DO YOU SEE? &gt;&gt; THE KEY TO THIS PLAY, WHERE DOES THE BALL CROSS THE SIDELINE. HE HAS IT IN HIS LEFT HAND BUT HIS LEFT HAND IS BEHIND HIM RIGHT ON HIS RIGHT HIP, WHICH IS SHORT OF THE LINE TO GAIN. THIS WILL BE REVERSED SHORT OF THE LINE TO GAIN. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT WE THOUGHT TOO, MIKE. LIKE WE SAID, HIS -- THE BALL IS ON THE BACK OF HIS BODY. THEY SPOTTED THIS PAST THE 43 YARD LINE. YOU CAN TELL BY THE STRIP, THEY COULD STILL MOVE THE SPOT AND GIVE HIM THE FIRST DOWN IF THEY SEE FIT. &gt;&gt; WHAT THEY WILL DO, THEY'LL RESPOT THE BALL AND THEN REMEASURE IF THEY'RE NOT SURE. LOOKS CLEAR THAT HE'S SHORT OF THE 43. I THINK THE LINE WAS THE 43. &gt;&gt; MIKE, TO CLARIFY, IT'S NOT WHERE THE BALL BREAKS THE SCORED IN THE FIRST QUARTER LINE PLANE. IT'S WHERE THE FOOT HITS OUT-OF-BOUNDS, CORRECT? &gt;&gt; MORE OR LESS CROSSING THE SIDELINE HORIZONTAL, IT'S WHERE THE BALL CROSSES THE SIDELINES. THEN HE STEPS OUT-OF-BOUNDS AFTER THE BALL CROSSES. THAT'S WHERE THE BALL WILL BE. IF HE HAD BEEN GOING DOWN THE SIDELINE, YOU WOULD BE CORRECT. &gt;&gt; IF I'M KEN WHISENHUNT, I'D GO FOR IT. &gt;&gt; IT'S DETERMINED THAT THE RUNNER WAS SHORT OF THE LINE TO GAIN. THE FOOTBALL NEVER MAKES IT TO THE 43 YARD LINE. IT'S TENNESSEE'S BALL 4th AND A HALF YARD TO GO. THE BALL IS AT THE 42 1/2 YARD LINE. WILL THE GAME CLOCK OPERATOR SET THE CLOCK TO 3:09? &gt;&gt; WE THANK MIKE CAREY. MIKE PETTINE GETS TO KEEP HIS TIME-OUT. NOW IT'S FOURTH AND A HALF YARD. &gt;&gt; AND WE'VE ASSUMED THAT THEY WOULDN'T GET IT. THEY'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THEIR FOURTH DOWN OPTIONS. HE'S GOING FOR IT UNLESS THEY TRY TO DRAW CLEVELAND OFF SIDES. HE HAS THE BEST FOURTH DOWN PLAY THAT THEY HAVE SET UP RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; LET'S SEE IF THEY GO FOR IT OR TRY TO DRAW THE BROWNS OFF SIDES WITH 3:09 LEFT TO GO IN THE FOURTH QUARTER. &gt;&gt; WHITEHURST KEEPS IT. HE'S STACKED UP AND PUSHED BACK. AGAIN, IT COMES DOWN TO THE SPOT. HE APPEARED TO BE SHORT. WHISENHUNT'S GAMBLE MAY BACKFIRE IN HIS FACE. &gt;&gt; THEY SPOT IT ON THE FAR SIDE. IT'S WELL SHORT OF THE LINE TO GAIN. IT'S A FIRST DOWN CLEVELAND. &gt;&gt; I AGREE WITH BOTH OF YOU. WE HAVE AN INJURED PLAYER ON THE FIELD. WATCH CHARLIE WHITEHURST. HE'S STOOD UP TO RUN THE QUARTERBACK SNEAK. DIDN'T HAVE ANY LEVERAGE. I QUESTION THE CALL WITH YOUR BACKUP QUARTERBACK IN THE SESSION. HE STANDS STRAIGHT UP. &gt;&gt; AND WHITEHURST PLATE IN THE PLAY. THE PLAY HAD BEEN WHISTLED DEAD. &gt;&gt; WELL SHORT. FIRST AND 10 CLEVELAND. &gt;&gt; DIDN'T MATTER. WHITEHURST CONTINUED TO ROLL DOWN THE LINE. LUNGED BUT WAY TOO LATE. AND KEN WHISENHUNT SAYS WAIT A MINUTE. HE WANTS TO CHALLENGE A SPOT NOW. &gt;&gt; I WOULDN'T DO THAT IF I WAS WHISENHUNT. WHITEHURST WAS STUFFED FROM THE BEGINNING. THAT WILL COST HIM A TIME-OUT IF HE THROWS IT AND THEY FAIL. &gt;&gt; WHISENHUNT IS THINKING THE SECOND EFFORT. BUT IT'S FORWARD PROGRESS AND ALL THAT. &gt;&gt; THEY'RE NOT GOING TO OVERTURN THAT. &gt;&gt; YOU MIGHT HAVE TO CHALLENGE. MIGHT NOT HAVE A CHOICE. THE GAME COULD BE SITTING IN FRONT OF YOU. YOU HAVE TO TAKE EVERY OPPORTUNITY. WHITEHURST WILL TELL YOU, HE GOT OVER THE LINE LATE. HE'S PLEADING HIS CASE. TO ME THE WHISTLE HAD BLOWN -- &gt;&gt; TENNESSEE IS CHALLENGING THE RULING ON THE FIELD AS RELATES TO A FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; LET'S LISTEN IN TO THE LAST PLAY TO SEE IF WE CAN HEAR WHEN THE WHISTLE BLOWS. &gt;&gt; I DON'T THINK HE GOT IT. &gt;&gt; THEY BLEW THE WHISTLE EARLY. THEN WHITEHURST CAME OFF BACKWARDS WHEN KRUGER WAS PULLING ON HIM AND EXTENDED IT WELL ACROSS THE LINE. IT WAS TOO LATE. &gt;&gt; I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE TO TO BACK TO THE INITIAL DECISION. IT WAS HALF A YARD. CLEVELAND HIGH SCHOOL A TIME-OUT. THEY HAVE TO GO THE LENGTH OF THE FIELD WITH A TIME-OUT. THAT'S A GUTSY CALL RIGHT THERE FROM THEIR OWN END. &gt;&gt; A LITTLE OVER THREE MINUTES TO GO. THAT'S A LOT OF TIME FOR A NO HURDLE ATTACK. THREE MINUTES IS A LONG TIME. &gt;&gt; LET'S DO BACK TO NEW YORK AND MIKE CAREY. WHAT DO YOU SEE ON THIS ONE? &gt;&gt; THE KEY HERE IS WHERE IS THE BALL WHEN THE WHISTLE IS BLOWN. YOU CAN HEAR IT VERY CLEARLY. YOU CAN SEE THE BALL IS SHORT OF THE LINE TO GAIN. SO THIS REVIEW WILL BE UPHELD. THEY WILL LOSE A TIME-OUT. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, MIKE. &gt;&gt; THIS CROWD HAVE NOT GOING TO BE HAPPY WITH THIS OFFICIATING CREW. THEY'VE BEEN ON THE WRONG END OF A LOT OF PENALTIES, CATASTROPHIC REVIEWS. &gt;&gt; THE FIRST HALF WAS ALL CLEVELAND. AN THE PENALTIES DOING THE WRONG WAY. THE SECOND HALF IS ALL TENNESSEE. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT. GENE IS READY FOR THE ANNOUNCEMENT. &gt;&gt; AFTER THE REVIEW, THE RULING ON THE FIELD STANDS. CLEVELAND'S BALL, FIRST AND 10. &gt;&gt; SO THE CHALLENGE PAYS OFF. KEN WHISENHUNT'S CHALLENGE BLOWS UP. THEY LOSE A TIME-OUT. EACH TEAM HAS A TIME-OUT REMAINING. 3:03 TO GO. &gt;&gt; THIS COMES DOWN TO SHEER WILL NOW. THIS TENNESSEE TITAN'S DEFENSE HAS STOOD UP AND ANSWERED THE BALL THE LAST TIME CLEVELAND HAD THE BALL. THEY HAVE TO DO IT AGAIN TO BRIAN HOYER. THIS IS ALL YOU CAN ASK FOR. GOOD FIELD POSITION FOR HIS TEAM TO TAKE THE BALL DOWN AND WIN THE GAME. &gt;&gt; THIS IS NOT UNFAMILIAR TERRITORY TO CLEVELAND. I'M SURE -- YOU'RE RIGHT. GIVEN WHERE THEIR TEAM IS RIGHT NOW, THEY WOULD RATHER HAVE THEIR OFFENSE WITH A CHANCE TO WIN RATHER THAN THEIR DEFENSE BECAUSE THEIR OFFENSE HAS BEEN THE MOST PRODUCTIVE SIDE OF THE BALL FOR THEM. &gt;&gt; FIRST AND 10 FROM THE 43 YARD LINE. IT'S BEN TATE. HE GETS TO THE 40. A PICK UP OF 2 ON THE PLAY. INSIDE THREE MINUTES TO GO. &gt;&gt; I THINK WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE IS PATIENCE OUT OF THE CLEVELAND BROWNS. THEY HAVE BEEN RUNNING THE FOOTBALL VERY WELL. THERE'S NOT ANY PANIC OR TRY TO GET IT ALL AT ONCE. TWO MINUTES AND 40 SECONDS LEFT. STILL A TIME-OUT. CLEVELAND TRYING TO STOP THE SEVEN-GAME ROAD LOSING STREAK. BEN TATE, 123 YARDS ON THE GROUND. SECOND AND 8. HOYER OVER THE MIDDLE. IT'S CAUGHT. MILES AUSTIN, FIRST DOWN TO THE 17 YARD LINE. A GAIN OF 23. &gt;&gt; THAT WAS A VERY GOOD JOB BY BRIAN HOYER. HE LOOKS TO HIS LEFT. AND THEN THREADS A PERFECT BALL BETWEEN TWO DEFENDERS TO MILES AUSTIN. THAT'S THE VETERAN, RYAN HOYER. &gt;&gt; THE CLEVELAND BROWNS TRYING TO STOP A SEVEN-GAME ROAD LOSING STREAK. THEY HAVE NOT WON ON THE ROAD SINCE LAST DECEMBER OF 2013. JAKE LOCKER INJURED IN THE SECOND QUARTER FOR TENNESSEE. CLEVELAND WAS DOWN 28-3. THEY HAVE SCORED 19 UNANSWERED POINTS. THEY HAVE IT FIRST AND 10 AT THE TENNESSEE 17 YARD LINE. HOYER. END ZONE. INCOMPLETE. A FLAG FLIES IN FROM THE SECONDARY. &gt;&gt; ILLEGAL CONTACT. &gt;&gt; PRIOR TO THE PASS, ILLEGAL CONTACT. DEFENSE. NUMBER 54. 5-YARD PENALTY. FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; THAT'S ON THE ROOKIE, AVERY WILLIAMSON. RIGHT HERE IN THE SLOT. JUST PUT A HAND ON HIS SHOULDER IT LOOKED LIKE. &gt;&gt; I'LL TELL YOU, DANGEROUS THROW BY BRIAN HOYER. GOT AWAY WITH ONE HIGH OVER THE MIDDLE. COULD HAVE BEEN A PICK. THEY GET THE PENALTY. &gt;&gt; AND FIRST AND 10 FOR THE BROWNS. HIGHER OVER THE MIDDLE. AT THE 5 YARD LINE EACH TEAM WITH ONE TIME-OUT REMAINING. &gt;&gt; FOR ME, I THINK KYLE SHANAHAN WILL RUN THIS FOOTBALL. THEY CAN GET A FIRST DOWN AT THE TWO YARD LINE OF THE TITANS. THEY WILL TAKE THAT WITH 1:35 AND COUNTING. THEY'LL RUN IT, TRY TO GET A FIRST DOWN AND END IT WITH A TOUCHDOWN. THAT'S THE PERFECT SCENARIO. &gt;&gt; AND THEY HAVE THE ONE TIME-OUT REMAINING AS WELL. 1:17 TO GO FOURTH QUARTER. SECOND AND FOUR. HOYER WITH TIME. LOOKING END ZONE. CAUGHT BY BENJAMIN. TOUCHDOWN! WHAT A CATCH BY TRAVIS BENJAMIN. BUT THERE'S A FLAG AT THE GOAL LINE. &gt;&gt; IS IT AGAINST TENNESSEE? &gt;&gt; AGAINST THE TITANS. THE REFEREE HUDDLING UP. ALL INDICATIONS IT'S AGAINST TENNESSEE. &gt;&gt; PRIOR TO THE PASS, HOLDING, DEFENSE NUMBER 58. THE PENALTY IS DECLINED. THE RESULT OF THE PLAY, TOUCHDOWN. &gt;&gt; SECOND TOUCHDOWN BY TRAVIS BENJAMIN. &gt;&gt; FOR THOSE OF YOU JUST JOINING US, THE FIRST HALF OF THE GAME, THE CLEVELAND BROWNS COULD NOT HAVE LOOKED LESS COMPETITIVE. AT THE END OF THE FIRST HALF, THEY MANAGED TO GET A TOUCHDOWN, CAME BACK AFTER HALF TIME AND HAVE DOMINATED ON BOTH SIDES OF THE FOOTBALL. &gt;&gt; NOW THE CRITICAL EXTRA POINT BY BILLY CUNDIFF TO GIVE CLEVELAND THE ONE-POINT LEAD. AND IT'S GOOD. CLEVELAND WAS DOWN 28-3. THEY NOW HAVE THE LEAD 29-28. &gt;&gt; WELL, THIS WAS A GREAT PLAY CALLED BY KYLE SHANAHAN. A GREAT JOB OF GETTING IT THROUGH THE READ. THE PROTECTION WAS AWESOME BY THE OFFENSIVE LINE UP FRONT. AND YOU'RE GOING TO SEE, TRAVIS BENJAMIN IN THE SLOT AT THE BOTTOM. HE FAKED ON THE INSIDE. SEALS IT BACK. ONE-ON-ONE COVERAGE AND THE GREAT THROW TO THE BACK OF THE END ZONE BY BRIAN HOYER. CAME UP EXACT LY THE WAY THEY WANTED TO. GREAT JOB BY TRAVIS BENJAMIN. &gt;&gt; AND GUYS, GIVE A LOT OF CREDIT TO KYLE SHANAHAN AND MIKE PETTINE. BENJAMIN MUFFED A PUNT LAST WEEK AND MUFFED A PUNT TODAY. HE JUST SCORED HIS SECOND TOUCH TOWN OF THE DAY. VERY EASILY COULD HAVE BENCHED BENJAMIN AFTER HIS STRUGGLES. &gt;&gt; NOW KNOW YOUR PACKAGES. TRAVIS BENJAMIN OBVIOUSLY A BIG PART OF THE GAME PLAN WITH TWO TOUCHDOWNS. I LIKE THE FACT THAT MIKE PETTINE DECIDED TO STAY WITH HIM. KYLE SHANAHAN GIVING HIM A CHANCE TO MAKE THE PLAY. &gt;&gt; BERNARD POLLARD WHO IS COMING OFF THE FIELD FOR TENNESSEE SO JAKE LOCKER IS OUT. HE WAS THE STARTER. LOOKED GREAT IN THERE HE INJURED HIS RIGHT HAND IN THE SECOND QUARTER. IT'S BEEN ALL CHARLIE WHITEHURST SINCE. HE THREW TWO TOUCHDOWNS OFF THE BENCH IN THE SECOND QUARTER. THE SECOND HALF, TENNESSEE HAS DONE NOTHING OFFENSIVELY. THEY HAVE ONE TIME-OUT REMAINING. &gt;&gt; TENNESSEE AND CHARLIE WHITEHURST OFFENSIVELY HAVE LOOKED VERY TENTATIVE IN THE SECOND HALF. YOU HIT ON IT EARLIER. THE BROWNS HAVE DOMINATED ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BALL. A LOT OF THAT, I BELIEVE, IS DUE TO THE TENTATIVE NATURE OF THE PLAY-CALLING AND COMFORT LEVEL WITH CHARLIE WHITEHURST AS THE QUARTERBACK. &gt;&gt; TENNESSEE WILL START AT THE 20 YARD LINE. KEEP THIS IN MIND. RYAN SUCCOP, THE TENNESSEE KICKER, HIS CAREER LONG IS 54. SO CHARLIE WHITEHURST COMES BACK OUT ON THE FIELD FOR THE TITANS. &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT CHARLIE WHITEHURST, BUT I DO KNOW THAT HE'S GOING TO SURVIVE IN THIS SITUATION, HE HAS TO BE LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS OPPORTUNITY. HE CANNOT HAVE ANY DOUBT IN HIS MIND WHETHER HE CAN GET THE JOB DONE. &gt;&gt; HE'S GOT TO EMBRACE THIS. HE HAS TO GET TO THE 36 YARD LINE. 3 PHI YARD LINE OF THE BROWNS TO DO THIS. YOU'RE RIGHT, YOU HAVE TO EMBRACE THIS IF YOU'RE A BACKUP QUARTERBACK AND DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO WIN THIS SITUATION. &gt;&gt; WHITEHURST IN TROUBLE. GETS AWAY FROM ONE. WHITEHURST LOOKING DEEP. THROWS INTO DOUBLE COVERAGE. IT'S INCOMPLETE. KRUGER HIT WHITEHURST ON THE RELEASE. &gt;&gt; YEAH, PAUL KRUGER SAID HELLO BIG TIME, THIS HAVE THE WAY THE SECOND HALF LOOKED AS THIS GAME HAS GOTTEN CLOSER. YOU CAN SEE -- OBVIOUSLY THERE WAS PRESSURE THERE. HE'S LOOKING RIGHT, LOOKING LEFT. RIGHT THERE THREW ONE UP FOR GRABS. &gt;&gt; THAT WAS NOT A GREAT THROW EVEN UNDER DURESS. AND KRUGER PUSHED OHER INTO THE LAP OF CHARLIE WHITEHURST. KRUGER WITH A GREAT PLAY. &gt;&gt; AND SECOND AND 10. WHITEHURST OVER THE MILE. DEFLECTED AT THE LINE. TENNESSEE HAS THREE FIRST DOWNS IN THE SECOND HALF. &gt;&gt; BY THE WAY, THE BROWNS AGAIN, ANOTHER CLOSE GAME. ALL THREE OF THEIR GAMES DECIDED IN THE FINAL SECONDS. &gt;&gt; LOOK AT YOUR DO-TO GUYS. WALKER HERE AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN. UNCOVERED. CHARLIE WHITEHURST HAS TO GET TO THE TOP OF THE PROGRESSION. YOU HAVE TO KNOW YOUR READ AND WHO IS ON THE FIELD. &gt;&gt; NO DOUBT, FOURTH DOWN TERRITORY FOR THE TITANS. THIRD AND 10. WHITEHURST TO WASHINGTON. HAS THE FIRST DOWN. TACKLED AT THE 32 YARD LINE. CLOCK CONTINUES TO TICK. TENNESSEE HAS THE ONE TIME-OUT REMAINING. &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHERE THE CLEVELAND BROWNS LET UP ON THE BALTIMORE RAV RAVENS. ALL THEY HAVE TO TO IS TO GIVE UP ONE PLAY. &gt;&gt; 30 SECONDS TO GO. WHITEHURST TO WALKER. ANOTHER FIRST DOWN. HE GOES OUT-OF-BOUNDS. &gt;&gt; THAT'S HUGE BE DELANIE WALKER. LOOKS LIKE HE WOULDN'T DO IT. HAD HIM DOUBLED UP THERE. JOE HAYDEN TRYING TO KEEP HIM INBOUNDS. DIDN'T HAPPEN. &gt;&gt; THEY'RE ABLE TO SAVE THE TIME-OUT. 24 SECONDS REMAIN. &gt;&gt; WHITEHURST. SACKED. WILLIAMS BRINGS HIM DOWN. NOW TENNESSEE CALLS ITS FINAL TIME-OUT WITH 16 SECONDS REMAINING. &gt;&gt; BRILLIANTLY EXECUTED BLITZ OFF THE BACK SIDE. YOU CAN SEE THE BLITZ THERE. THAT WAS WILLIAMS. CHARLIE WHITEHURST INEXPERIENCED. DID NOT SEE IT COMING. THERE'S NOBODY TO BLOCK HIM. YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE TO GET RID OF THE FOOTBALL. &gt;&gt; WILLIAMS CAME FROM THE SECONDARY. HE WASN'T SHOWING THAT HE WAS GOING TO BLITZ. WHITEHURST DIDN'T RECOGNIZE IT. WILLIAMS WAITING TILL THE BALL WAS SNAPPED. YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY YOU DRAFT THESE GUYS? THEY RUN A 4.4. THAT'S WHY. HE WENT FROM THE SECONDARY TO THE QUARTERBACK IN NOTHING FLAT. WATCH HOW FAST HE CLOSES THIS. &gt;&gt; CHARLIE WHITEHURST HAS TO KNOW WHERE HE'S VULNERABLE. DIDN'T HAVE THE AWARENESS BACK SIDE. &gt;&gt; SECOND AND 16. WHITEHURST LOOKING DEEP. KENDALL WRIGHT IS DOWN THERE. IT'S DEFLECTED AND INCOMPLETE. &gt;&gt; NINE SECONDS REMAIN. &gt;&gt; AND THAT WAS A KILLER ON THE PREVIOUS PLAY. THE SACK FORCED THEM TO USE THE TIME-OUT. RIGHT THERE, THE JUMP BALL TO GIBSON. &gt;&gt; AND WITH BOTH GUYS GOING UP FOR A JUMP BALL, THE DEFENDER HAS AS MUCH RIGHT AS THE OFFENSIVE PLAYER DOES. IT'S NOT ILLEGAL CONTACT OR PASS INTERFERENCE. &gt;&gt; AND CHARLIE WHITEHURST HAS TO GET A COMPLETION NEAR MIDFIELD, OUT-OF-BOUNDS. &gt;&gt; HAS TO GET OUT-OF-BOUNDS ON THIRD DOWN. WHITEHURST TO WRIGHT INBOUNDS. CLOCK CONTINUES TO TICK. THAT WILL DO IT. CLEVELAND COMES BACK FROM 28-3 DOWN TO STUN THE TITANS. THE BROWNS CLOSE THE GAME ON A 26-0 RUN. THIS IS THE BIGGEST BLOWN LEAD IN TENNESSEE HISTORY.
