[Music] Hey, this is Evan and I'm at the Santiam Pass Trailhead. We're going to be doing Three Fingered Jack today. I'm here with Jeremy Forrest, and Kirk. It's going to be about 3,000 feet of elevation gain. Looks like a nice hot day today. So we'll see how it goes. It should be about 10 to 12 miles roundtrip. And we're about to head off. 8:45AM right now Three Fingered Jack is volcanic Peak located in the Oregon Cascades that has rugged terrain and breathtaking views. It is named after its three distinct pinnacles that resemble fingers on a hand. The Climb was just over 13 miles round trip with 2800 feet of elevation gain. The climb follows the Pacific Crest Trail for about five miles which intersects with the climber's trail. [Music] Three finger Jack is situated between Mount Jefferson and Mount Washington in the Oregon Cascades. [Music] There isn't a lot of shade from the sun for the first couple miles on the trail due to the B&amp;B complex fire in 2003 which burned over 90 000 Acres between Mount Jefferson and Mount Washington [Music] It made for an interesting landscape and we had to walk over quite a few trees that had fallen across the trail. [Music] Just over three miles in on the Pacific Crest Trail. 800 feet of elevation gained so far. Making good time. Just going through this burnt out forest getting some nice views of Mount Washington behind me and some of the sisters. Coming up on some views shortly of Three Fingered Jack where we'll be heading. So far a good day. [Music] We're at 3.8 miles and I just got out of the burned forest and now we're in some wooded areas which is nice because it gives them a shade, so hopefully it stays like this for a bit longer. [Music] Eventually we came out of the trees and started to get some great views of Three Fingered Jack. We left the Pacific Crest Trail and jumped onto climber's trail and started to make our way up to south ridge. Just starting up one of the slopes of Three Fingered Jack. It's going to get steep here. [Music] We came across a common garter snake as we started up to scree. [Music] About halfway up we got off the slope and found some more stable footing off to this side Thus begins the climb... [Music] We're 6.5 miles in and elevation is just about 7000 feet and we're making our way up three finger jack right now. [Music] So we made it up to where we're going to go to the summit. We're going to lay some rope. Leave our packs here. I'll leave this big camera here and just go with the GoPro. We're just going to lay some rope and follow the rock there. There's a traverse and then go up to the top there. It's going to be interesting. [Music] There was a short exposed reverse that we had to manage in order to get to this section where we would start using rope. [Music] And then you'll clip in with your personal pro. And then you'll belay me. It'd probably be easiest to just belay me off your harness. [Music] We each took turns navigating the portion of the climb called the &quot;Crawl.&quot; We made our way along the rope using our prusiks and there's quite a bit of exposure at times [Music] It took roughly 15 minutes each to get across this portion. [Music] So we just got done with the fix line portion. Right now Forrest is doing the lead belay up to the top so we're gonna belay up and come on down. And then that'll be it. But, getting there. The area just below the summit block was surprisingly stable and was a great place to take in some views. [Music] The chimney on the summit block is rated the low fifth class. We each took turns climbing up, and then coming back down. [Music] The rock climbing was fairly straightforward with good holds along the way. [Music] High five dude! Just made it the top of Three Fingered Jack. 7841 feet. Getting some great views of the surrounding mountains. it was a yeah pretty steep and pretty interesting coming up. Forest did a great job making sure we all made it. This is awesome. We've got some cool views. [Music] After taking in some breathtaking views I started my descent. Okay, you can start lowering when ready. Lowering [Music] Once down from the summit block, we packed up our gear and made our way back to the &quot;crawl&quot; portion of the climb. Going back through the &quot;crawl&quot; was just as tedious as it was coming in. We went up to the summit and made our way back. Forrest and Kirk are getting the rope and taking it back. Jeremy's here too. He's made it. How are you feeling? Yeah. Feeling a lot better. Lots of scary parts. That was intense. And now once Forrest and Kirk get back, we're going to make our way down the mountain hopefully before dark. I was able to get a few more nice views as everybody made it back through the traverse. Spicy... Exposed... Airy It's not over yet. We got to get down. That's my two cents...not over yet. We started heading down the mountain which we were all happy about. We made our way down to scree and it was a lot faster going down than it was coming up. [Music] We got some amazing views on our way back. It was a long day and we didn't arrive to the parking lot until just after 10 pm. Thanks for watching our adventure and be sure to give this video a big like and subscribe.
