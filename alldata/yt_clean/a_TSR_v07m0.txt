- [Mark] This guy stole my package, and he's about to open it in his house. - Hello. - [Mark] But what he doesn't know is that this is a new and improved, custom-built bait package on four different cameras, of the world's finest glitter, along with some other nasty surprises. (machine whirring) - What the (beeping)? - [Mark] But to understand we need to go back one and a half years, (tape warbling) because that's when from my porch and the police even with the video And so, drawing inspiration I decided to make a bait package and the internet seemed to like it. But despite my best efforts, are either stolen or go missing every day. (hinge creaking) - Hello. - Macaulay Culkin? (air whooshing) - (beeping). (door shutting) - No, no, no, no, no, wait! (air whooshing) - (sighs) I'm sorry. It's just that &quot;Home Alone&quot; for the Glitterbomb. - No, no, that's cool. I love that. Just that I do like run my website, bunnyears.com. But seriously though, but actually I think I can (air whooshing) - [Mark] And so with Macaulay's have literally spent the last and testing a new and So today I'm gonna walk you and then show you what 10 of these bait packages all across America. We started with a complete to make it more streamlined and secure. For contrast, last year's design The fundamentals are still a battery powered, custom on the bottom that has so it can sense when it's been jostled. And then it tells these four And these are wide angle you'll be able to record the thief no matter which side they open it from. And then right here, we but we added a second bottle this year. So as both these motors spin cams around, not only does it spray twice as much, but we changed the And it is wretched. - Dude! (laughing) Oh man. Oh, it's in my mouth, man. I feel like I just ate a turd. Never done that, to be clear. - And just to prove how much worse it was, I sprayed last year's formula labeled A, and then this year's formula labeled B, for 10 different people, without telling them which was which. - Oh, that's like proper poo. (laughing) (both laughing) He just took a dump on my face. (bottle spritzing) (Macaulay gagging) - I still smell it. (Macaulay coughing) - [Mark] I'm sorry, I killed (kids giggling) - Smells like poop! - So A or B, that- - B by a mile. - [Mark] All 10 independently agreed, this year's was much worse. (upbeat music beginning) And then we keep spraying it they get rid of the before they realize This increases our since we already know the due to the GPS tracking on all the phones. But even if we somehow don't recover it, all these phones have LTE data plans. So they'll upload their so then we can see what happened. And then we have the main powered by a motor underneath here, which we fill with the which is actually biodegradable this year, as a nod to our good friend, Mother Earth. We also added sound effects this year. So after both the glitter have successfully deployed, - [Recording] Five, four, three. - Nothing actually happens at the end, but they won't know that. And then finally, after that, (police radio recordings playing) we added some fake police scanner chatter, just because it seemed - [Recording] Seems the - [Mark] So as you can see, it becomes nearly impossible without special tools. And so finally, we've got the lid, which has these two holes here, which we cover with one-way film, so we can record the outside And you'll notice this These are the fictitious BUZZ700s, named, of course, after And if the thieves took just two seconds to actually inspect the package, they would see that all are just slightly modified in addition to this amazing testimonial. And so then we just slapped and used a random barcode the nightly charging port, So the idea is the bad and then steals it off the porch. And then when they a magnet taped inside triggers which tells the circuit and everything is set in motion. And as far as I'm concerned, karmic justice has never (relaxed electronic music playing) And so now, all that was for all the boxes. So I sent out a call to all and we received over 400 with repeated package thefts in the past. And then from that, we narrowed the list and soon we had packages We also set up a website so I and monitor all the boxes to record states, battery phone levels, and even check the camera And things started out a bit rocky when we got a notification and then we noticed it all throughout the city. So while we were trying to locate it we checked the feed and was so convinced the package was real, he scanned it and picked it up, and it was riding around in his truck. Next, when someone else picked up the box, we didn't have the lid So as they were walking around, glitter started to spill out. - [Thief #1] Oh, look at that. There's glitter coming out of it. Oh, it's totally a scam. Yo, Nick! - [Mark] Which is, as - Dead giveaway! - [Thief #1] It's totally a scam. When you open it, it's (electronic beeping) - [Recording] Hello! - [Mark] This lady took it off a porch, but opened it upside down. As soon as she heard the she rushed it back to the just in time for nothing to happen. (air whooshing) But then the thefts began to pile up, and we started hitting our stride. (cover scraping) (machine whirring) Whoa. Oh my God. I mean... I don't know, let me put it back. Where's the... It's a mess. (Thief #5 gasping) (cardboard rattling) - [Recording] Recovery sequence initiated. (police scanner recording playing) (cardboard squeaking) - [Recording] It seems the (cardboard rattling) (metal unlatching) (hinge squeaking) (dumpster reverberating) (electronic beeping) - [Recording] Hello! - What? - [Recording] Keep the (cams whirring) - [Thief #6] Stuff flew Look at this (beeping). - [Thief #7] 'Cause you opened it, yeah. It's like remember that guy, that money, open money turned blue? That's, wipe that down please. - What kind is this? Yeah, but I got the it stinks, and all the stuff shot out. - [Thief #8] What do you (cams whirring) Open it and throw it out. (box thumping) - [Person #1] Caught (glitter crumbling) (cams whirring) - [Recording] Operation - Hm. (package thumping) - [Recording] 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, (cams whirring) nine, eight, seven... (package scraping) - [Recording] Hello. (package scraping) - [Thief #10] What the - [Recording] Keep the - [Thief #10] What'd it say? (cams whirring) Well, you opened it, dude. - [Thief #10] What happened? (both laughing) (package scraping) What the (beeping) is it? - [Thief #9] Well, it's still a speaker. (audio crackling) - What the (beeping) is this? - Dude. - [Thief #11] There has to be still something in there, right? (package rustling) - [Thief #9] Hey, good afternoon. (glitter rustling) - [Thief #11] No, dude. What the... (cams whirring) - [Recording] Nine, - Whoa, back the (beeping) up- - [Woman] (laughing) Get out of my store! (police radio recordings playing) - I don't know, dude! (police radio recordings playing) - [Recording] I'm about six minutes away. - What the (beeping)? (package scraping) I told you not to open it. - [Thief #9] Dude, what is that? - [Woman] Are you... Get out! Get out! - And then you smell it. - (beeping) - What's it smell like? that (beeping) is gnarly. - [Mark] After we and recovered it by the and they were sweeping which felt amazing. (package scuffing) - [Thief #12] Babe, I I bought you some Bose headphones, okay? Some really good ones. - [Recording] Surprise, mother(beeping). (machine whirring) (tape warbling) (machine whirring slowly) (machine whirring) - [Recording] Keep the (cams whirring) - [Recording] Operation initiated. - (beeping). (cardboard rustling) Ugh. - [Recording] Operation - Aw, you (beeping)... (cams whirring) All right, all right. We (beeping), all right, All right, we (beeping) get it. Okay. Smells like (beeping) (beeping) in here. (cardboard rustling) - And in the middle of all this, something happened that I still One of the volunteers we sent knows my channel and who I even interviewed to decided it would be a good idea and never had any intention on his porch or sending it back to us. After a week of us being really nice and trying to work with him, he effectively admitted as such, and then blocked and ghosted me. And it's just like, bro, if don't pick the dude who of his life avenging a theft If I'm willing to get I could easily reorder, what to the guy who steals the outcome of that year and a half of work? I quit my job at NASA and I only make 12 of them a year. So I have plenty of time, over these little details. Plus, even though this is than a prank channel, I love Like when I took this and taped it to the back of my wife's car right in front of the backup camera. (crowd cheering) So when she puts it in (crowd howling) And so after a little detective work, I discovered he gave us his but he shipped it to his buddy's address. So I found his real address, and then did two (upbeat music beginning) I've heard once the Scientologists and know you're even remotely interested, they will follow you And so since I had all this I might have gone on their website and said I was very and then ordered $300 worth of their starting course material. So they know he's a worth keeping track of. And the second thing was, I designed over 10 custom For example, he's from Texas, for his $500 donation to &quot;Texans for Hillary would be nice, or this for the upcoming furry convention. But the trick is, while I I went on Google Maps, and looked up his neighbors' addresses. And hypothetically, I might to a random assortment A lot of these are great, type of thing where the more you deny it, the more guilty you look. So some of these will to his mailbox by his and he'll always be second guessing just how many more there were, and who's silently judging him Now, I wanna mention we out in the world too, who keep our boxes from being stolen. For example, this woman the package was stolen by a professional porch pirate, who knew exactly how to cover up her face. But then we said, hold (tape warbling) Unbelievably, she has the same body type and owns the exact same shoes and pants as that good Samaritan. So we turned the footage if they too could And it just goes to show of who a porch pirate I'm just kidding. This was a super nice lady for her neighbor, but it got us thinking, and instead of just always we wanted to try and reward the good guys. So in some cases, we left and we changed the label to a real name, and left tons of contact information like phone number and And quite a few people took the but instead of opening it, they called to tell us because they were worried And so instead of glitter and fart spray, I gave them $400 because cost for them when they - Thank you. - [Mark] For being one - [Man #1] Thank you. - [Mark] Others, however, (package scuffing) - [Recording] Surprise, mother(beeping). (machine whirring) (tape warbling) (machine whirring slowly) (machine whirring) Keep the change, ya filthy animal. (cams whirring) - What the (beeping)? (laughing) - Whoa. (beeping) that, bro. - (laughing) Dude, that Oh my God. - Damn, I was just about to, like, try and find this dude too. - Damn! (cams whirring) - [Recording] 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, (both talking) - We thought we came up on - [Recording] Eight, seven, six. - Blew up in our face. - [Recording] Five, - Damn, son. - [Recording] Activation complete. (cams whirring) Recovery sequence initiated. (police radio recordings playing) - Hello? (police radio recordings playing) (cams whirring) (police radio recordings playing) - Yeah, we should call them. (police radio recordings playing) (door slamming) (cams whirring) (gate slamming) (upbeat music beginning) (glass breaking) (snowballs pelting) (upbeat music ending)
