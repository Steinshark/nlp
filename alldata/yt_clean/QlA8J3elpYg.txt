All right, we're where the best way to get to It's Gun Spin. You start life as a sad, broken gun. Your job to continue to shoot bullets harder and harder I don't know. I guess either you Yeah. Give me one more bullet. Why not? I love how it looks like someone has put this gun Going for a- Yeah. New record. Yeah. More bullet power, I guess. I love that. Like, getting this far That's the distance we've gotten so far. I feel like I'm going to have to end up just maxing out all of these I guess just keep the bullets coming. Now, I'm curious if there's, like, Or a perfect way to let your shots go? Oh, you can clearly get a ton of height! Oh, there's an ammo box. Oh, yeah. Give me 5% more of them, I guess. I used to think that and getting a lot of But it's possible that just like trying So what you do is. One, two, three. There we go. Yes. Yes. Oh, my God. Yeah. Keep going. Keep going, keep going. Okay, I, uh.... Thank you for the coins. Why do I feel like we're suddenly not going to have a problem All right. Height, speed, agility. Guns! Oh my God! New Gun, we're still going! Wow. The money really starts Head over to the armory. All right, so if a gun only has six shots, how am I shoving, like, Hey, where's she going to land? And I get the big ramp! Okay, so I guess So now we're at 616 and we haven't No more bullets, I guess. Yeah. More ammo boxes, more first shot, Just all this. All right. as many shots as possible, Look at it go! Yes! we're going to get 80% like it's nothing. 80% Nine bullets in this gun. How? It doesn't matter. I cannot I have no idea where I'm not in the right spot. Okay, so I don't quite want to go that high. So there we go. Keep it right about eye speed. Oh, my Godddddd.... One thousand meters! Ahhhhh!!!! We're going to space! And we're only on the second gun. or if I'm actually just going to shoot Alien. Gun. Let's see what you can do. Oh, you shoot little beany things. Okay, so are the beanie Oh, they're pretty fast. Okay. 700 meters. 800, 900. 1000. 1100. We're still up in the air. We're right past our best. We're going to get almost 2000- Guess I'll get the next gun It looks like my first gun. What have people been doing to this gun? Why is everyone abusing the firearms? Not really a strong gun sound. It's just kind of very blue. So if you time it right, you get that first launch and that launch gets you like 1200 meters. Like it's nothing. No upgrades on this. And we're already at 1271, I've got a ton of money Just whatever. Yeah. Yeah, all this. More bullets. Okay, so now we have 11 shots I'm going to try and get more speed here. Hold on. Speed, speed. My ramp was terrible. All right. We've got a couple of boosts I mean, we're going to get, like, Even with me being terrible. All right, water gun. I'm sorry for what I did to you. I'm going to try I can't even tell where the beam is Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah. Actually, even then, to get past like a thousand here. I think it's going to be like, yeah, like 1007 is still enough The problem is it's that shooting it is becoming a problem. I got to wait until it slows down. Oh, my God! Well, uh, I, uh, I think we may get a new best here. Yeah. What do you know? I still have one bullet left, too. I'll use it now. There we go. That's going to give us There's 100% brand new It looks like we're getting the Nintendo gun back system, the zapper gun, I like the feel of the zaps pretty fast. Okay, it's really fast. We're going incredibly fast right now The problem is, I don't know when I'm going to- That was pretty good. because we got a sweet ramp off of that I'm pretty sure we're going to get close to our best. Well, I, uh... I guess we can get some upgrades. I want so many ammo boxes Oh, starting to get dizzy There it is. Oh, yeah. Perfect. Epic speed. More ammo boxes. I only have one bullet left, so I got. I got to kind of make it count now. All right, about 2100. I'm just going all for speed here. Speed and height We've already shot That was just straight height. 1500, 1700 finally come back down to earth and yeah, get about 2100, maybe best 2500 2700 new personal best. Give me the ammo box. Yes, 2900, 3000. I think we're going to get it. 93. 95. Come on! That's right. We got a ton of money I'm just going for straight speed. All the speed. Keep it going. Oh, the distance. 21, 22, 23, 24. Come on, keep going. 27, 29, 3000. We're going to get there. We got there. 99, 100% brand new gun. It ends up probably around, Oh, it's going to go past 3600. We got a Nerf gun. I have fired many Nerf guns in my life, and this is exactly what they look like. Okay. Oh, yeah. Okay. Still got some speed going here. Okay. I'm out of bullets. This thing is just It's gotten a lot of good ramps so far. So we're going to get at least 3200. I don't think it's going to be a best, but it's going to get close Yeah, the ammo boxes have been really How many nerf darts are we shoving in her? All the speed. When it eventually like a reenters orbit, It's just going to be There it is. Okay. All right. Pretty, I've got two bullets left, Well, never mind. He could go all the- We went all the way by a lot. I kind of went up really high, and I I stayed up there so long I love that we're going back in time like the Jack Sparrow Oh, yeah. Oh, God. Oh, the speed. Well, there we go. I was going to say. I'll. I'll let you know But the whole. The whole scenery Oh, there it goes. It came back- It was only back to the planet to see its wife and kids. And then it went 80% no upgrades to it, yet. Catching some ammo boxes. 86. 87. All right. Almost at the Uzi already. This gun has gigantic balls. I mean, the ammo it has. That's like that's I'm pretty sure. Whoa! Well, I mean, I would shoot, but I don't I found it. Okay, well, we got our new personal best. Well, we got way The screen is flying by, so fast it's just a nonstop I can't believe we didn't hit a- This isn't even like All right, come on. But keep going. Can you get to 100,000 I'm kind of wondering. I hope that you can. We're already at 12,000. We might even get to 12,500. 12,500. Give me my points. I'm actually going to spend them now because I want it Uzi, only 17 bullets for the Uzi. It doesn't seem like that many. All right. Uh huh. Oh, God. Shoot. There goes. I love that this It's got, like, almost like cat whiskers. It'll get it'll it has like an extra to know how bad it is for me Okay. 4000. 4500. I think we're going to get this gun but I don't think I don't think that's going I still have a bullet left, if I had to guess. I need this gun to turn it Maybe get another. Oh, I finally got to realize there's I'm waiting to be assaulted I guess I at least Oh, that's not a tendril. All right, halo gun. You got all kinds of weird tubes So let's see what they're worth. Uh huh, I don't want it now. You don't want to go too Stay right in the middle of the screen you want to go down and then you want to go- and then you want to go up. But the problem is, when you go up this high, for like a minute and a half and It's going to get the next gun again, I still haven't upgraded this, so when it finally hits the ground. If I can get a couple of ammo boxes, Oh, there's one ammo box. So 10,000. No big deal. Can we get 11? I need a couple lucky jumps There's a second one. So we're at 10,600. Yeah. 10,700. Yeah. Yeah. More ammo boxes. Why not add more bullets? All right, over to the bolt gun. Going to shoot some Okay. Oh, yeah. It's like a Oh, this swan is going nuts. Oh, my God. Yeah, I'm out of bullets. All right, at this point now, it's. It's in the Gun Lord's hands. I have no idea what we're going end up- We're going to get the next gun. But I don't know We just lost a ton of speed. Oh, now this. This is legitimately a Super Soaker. We make it 10,000. We're really slow down. All right, so we're still on rare. is still just a rare. maybe even slightly above average. Yeah. I'll let you know It probably won't be until about 25%. All right. Well, maybe 27%. Okay. Maybe 34. There it is. Hey. Okay. Speed, speed. As much speed as I can get, at least I can get some good movement in. And if we get another couple of ammo Unfortunately, we just hit a bad jump, There's too much speed. Oh, there's too much speed. Oh, my God. Oh, Lord. I don't know what percent it's going to be when it comes back down, but it's looking pretty fast. This is the longest I don't even remember what percentage but it will get the next gun Oh, it's a blinged out AK platform. Isn't that nice? Might as well keep going, I guess. I don't know if we can beat our 12,000, Well, never mind. We totally got 12,000. I think it was 12,500 or so. Yep. Beat that, too. Way past there. 13,500. Probably going to get 13,700. Okay. Even better than 13,700. 13,900. Give me that ammo box. Oh, so close. Ah, gold plated sadness. I love it. Oh, it has a definitely Okay. Oh yeah. What Okay. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, I got launched to, like, 2400 meters And now I'm going to I'm going to be I'll come back and I'll I'll already be Oh, never mind. I'm gone again. Apparently, I liked it That actually kind of makes sense in today's world. Okay, 90%. Are we just going to get the new gun? Just having spent I still have four bullets left Totally got the new gun. Probably going to be our I need this gun to flip around. Don't they go. You flipped. Yep. Oh yeah. Okay, got it. Got a little bit of speed up. Good jump. 1200. So I think we had like 12 or 12,000. I think we had 12,500 or 700 before. I don't think we're going to get there, for the first try on this and immediately MIB Is this the noisy cricket? It looks kind of like it. Now, let's see. I got to do this gun justice. Oh. Oh, yeah, I had to. I had to shoot down a little- I was going to say I had to shoot down This is actually good, though, because now Finally, because we've been just sitting there doing I should be able to get like five or six we're going to end up with like 7000 for a bad jump. Eh, 6300. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Just go right across or cricketing. Oh. I'm cricketing real hard. All this- All right. Still got five bullets left. We got a pretty decent jump. We've got. We got, like, a like a one that doesn't go out So that's good. I just need so I can shoot some more bullets because I still have a ton of em left Oh, there we go. Oh, yeah. Okay, one bullet left. We're going to get pretty far. It's going to get pretty close. Yeah. 95. 96. All right. 96% I just need to arc it downward a little bit more. Okay. I got as far I got all the bullets done. So now it's just a matter We even got a couple of ammo crates in. So it's going to be pretty close But we got the new gun. So now it's just a matter of We're going to be the whole 13,500. Right past 14,000, probably to 14, 700. There's 14, 700. If we get another box, Didn't get the box. Didn't get 15,000. We got rid of those. That would make sense. I feel like it sounded much I've still got to try and make it work. Uh huh. Oh. Oh, boy. Oh, okay. Now, how good was the jump? That's the question. I think we got like three or four So there's a really good chance close to 90% before it dies out. 82. 88. There's 90. Oh, wow. Am I going straight to the next gun? Well, we got we got the next gun. There it is right there. 100%. 13,000 meters. I am completely out of ammo, How high did it go that time? My gimme. Gimme a lucky ammo box. Why not? Right. We can get Come on. Getting so close More ammo boxes and just shotgun. That's it. I can't believe that It's just called shotgun. Oh, it does have the very satisfying It's helping me time everything, actually. Like, yeah, they It makes it so much easier. I'm not a visual person. I'm an auditory person! The yeet to space! I love you so much. Well, you're not really in my hand. I really don't know Just the. The force of my own hatred. We got the new gun, So we ended up way past our personal best. This is the kind of speed where we might even get, like, 19,000. Okay, maybe we'll get 20,000. That was another really good hop. Okay. So 19,500. at this point. 21,000 meters. I wish it could just go past that gun because I feel like we would have unlocked 21,444 Going to have a couple of points to spend here. Okay, we've got two more guns left. All right. Do good. Otherwise it's back to the carbonite with you. I'm doing pretty good, actually. I have no idea where this gun is right I can save this. Uh huh. Uh huh. I Oh. I need a little bit of height there. Okay. That's the best I can do. It's going on its trip. It's got, like, 17 weeks of vacation stored up, so it's not going to be back If we get lucky, it'll probably be around It's amazing that getting 10,000 That's just barely, you know, like three That scrub numbers, rookie numbers, more zeros to the ends I got it. Got way past I never thought it would get especially since I messed up But we're going to end up I'm not really worried too much Yeah, this one is much harder to time I don't know what it is about it. It just feels a little weirder. Like I said, it's probably just an- Well, that time it went off the screen. It actually got so fast I couldn't even see where it was That's okay, though, you know, good. 80% I like that. I cannot believe We're totally going So we're ending up with the Saw Gun. Now at 16,000, 17,000, this might end up being a personal best 19 for 19 nine, there's 21. Come on. Just I mean, yeah, ago Now, you've gotten this far already, And then finally, 22,196. I'm not even going to upgrade this gun. I don't need it. Not for the Gears Gun. Any time someone puts a chainsaw It's a zombie game and I feel like a terrible person, so that's a total guess for me. All right. I did everything I could. 7000. Like I said, 10,000. Scrub numbers. You got to get at least 10,000. Otherwise We got past 10,000. So, you know, suddenly it has become one. 70%. Yeah, decent hop. Like I said, probably not enough but easily enough I would say there's 85, 86. I shouldn't say at this point. We've actually got so many ammo boxes that if I get well, there's one if I get like four or five ammo boxes, I could easily get the 100%. My God, it might squeak the 100% in 99. That's the brand new gun, 16,000 meters. We were so far past that- Rainbow Legendary Gun. It is an actual unicorn. Here's what I want to do. I'm going to give and then I'm going to do just a ton of upgrades and see what our new personal best can be. So this is just kind of like, This is where we're starting at, Oh, my God, it's off the screen. What? Did I just break the game? It's off the screen and it's not landing. 17,000. 19,000. 20,000- Oh, God. I think we've gotten the new personal bad. It's 30,000.34- A few seconds later. No joke. I've just been sitting here *laughter* What happening? I'm and then I'll come right back. I left for 5 minutes. We actually have infinite distance. I could have shot through the earth, Our bullet is going to go It's going to end up hitting some poor Infinite meters!!!!!! Well, we shot a bullet and literally broke physics. Anyway, folks, hope you enjoyed this episode of Gun Spin.
