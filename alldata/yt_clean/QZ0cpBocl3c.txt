[ &quot;Danse Macabre&quot; by [Narrator] In 1736, a established the first before America had even The first automatic was invented in 1872 [sprinkler pops] and perfected a decade later. After 100 years, the shortening the time for [fire alarm beeping] Humans have created to protect those things that our homes, valuables, vital documents, irreplaceable relics, priceless memories. But today, many of our have moved online. So what do you do to The code, viruses, malware sent by arsonists that You do what you've always done. You call in the experts-- the people trained in [ anthemic music ] When it's your job to keep you have to live and breathe and see the internet just because the only is to think like one. [Matt] I think if you were they would probably fire department analogies [Narrator] Meet Matt Linton. He heads up a security If you asked him he often starts at [Matt] When I was a kid, I wanted nothing to do I had a laser focus I got my EMT license at 16, technically, before I [sunglass chime] From there I got my my hazardous And I just kept going. [Narrator] Before Matt clocked over a decade conducting specialized responding to and fighting fires at NASA. Yep... NASA. But what does firefighting [Matt] A way that is an awful lot like You have a because even though fire sprinklers, fire alarms, fire inspections to prevent fires eventually protections fail You need people whose is in responding to bad specifically dealing and not causing a lot [Narrator] Just as communities to protect those things that Google has its own set the emergency responders, who are responsible of our digital lives. They protect our cherished memories and family recipes, big ideas, blueprints finances, customer lists and inventories, math homework, dissertations, that one thing you and the billions of things use Google for every day. [Boy] Happy New Year! [Narrator] Now, how to handle the pressure [Royal] I started [Narrator] This is Royal Hansen. When he is not calming his he's running the entire Privacy, Safety and Security Royal and his team for the security of which is something he [Royal] Your interaction websites and companies, it's and live your life There's an enormous to protect user data, keep it private. And keeping it private [Narrator] And to keep you need more than an Because, well-- [Fatima] Right now there being launched against Google [Narrator] This She leads a team in detecting all those attacks. Every single one of them. Each with the potential [Fatima] There is no break. These attackers that are highly skilled. It's their job 24/7 to try to break [Tim] Google is a target of [Narrator] You probably [Tim voiceover] Hi, this [Narrator] He may run one of but he first got his feet wet during the single ever to hit Google: [Tim] All you really and you could do [Narrator] And in January 2021, a group of digital arsonists started shooting sparks trying to get a fire to ignite. The Threat Analysis Group [Shane] We started who instead of targeting which is generally, governments they were starting to directly [Narrator] Out of all the the North Korean government trying to keep the internet [ &quot;Trust in Me&quot; So how do you hack an expert? Well, you start with Nothing too generic. Ugh... too obscure. Yeah. Carter. Now, what does Carter look like? There. That could be a Carter. Why don't you, [Narrator] Hmm... Oh, we can get along, if only you trust in me [Narrator] And Meet Carter Edwards. [Shane] They created fake some websites, they created what Why don't you trust in me? [Shane] Trying to sort of so they look like a fellow [Narrator] The North fabricated a security But they didn't stop There was James Willy, Zhang Guo, North Korea built an entire army of fake security researchers and deployed them to become trusted members [Tim] The information security When you gain some it's easier to get that [Shane] When they contacting these researchers, they'd start this &quot;Hey, come check out this Can you help me look at it?&quot; [distorted hissing] [Toni] And then what establish a rapport, talk about what they [Narrator] But this wasn't These were calculated about obscure topics that only security [Heather] Tricking into visiting their website, and that website would And that would give them access to the researcher's machine. Guess what's on the Really awesome [Narrator] That research was like vulnerability libraries They were trying to find out how the locksmiths And how they could break them. [Toni] And one of you want having their hands is the North Korean government. [Narrator] If a security North Korea could gain needed to steal and personal information. They could cause real damage. [Shane] North Korea as because they have pretty but they have no restraint [Narrator] So when the noticed security researchers they had to investigate. [Tim] I think we all we really have to is Google affected by this? [Matt] When we we found attacks against [Narrator] The North had been messaging and some even started [Matt] We had a conversation who potentially interacted We said, &quot;Hey, have And we held up the milk jug. [Director] Have you [Heather] Piper Webster? [Director] How about [Matt] Nope. [Director] James Willy? [Heather] I don't [Director] Billy Brown? [Matt] Nope. [Narrator] But then-- [Matt] Yes, they had [Narrator] A Google they'd been messaging Carter Edwards. [wink chime] That's the spark. It's [fire alarm rings] [Matt] I view us the 911 system. We can be a full 24-hour, massive force against whatever it [Narrator] Their first move, analyze the breach to understand what kind of [Matt] We do a complete on the workstation we have people that They reverse it. They provide us with signals Who on the internet does What domain names does it use? What does it do to the system [Narrator] That initial to identify the mechanics But is this breach the only one? Or have the North Korean [ soft music ] This is Alex Stamos. He's the director of the a research program devoted Knowing the scope of comes with a job. [Alex] When you're defending from tens of you have to have a huge amount but then also the ability really, really quickly. Google's Detection and has been at the forefront of using big data tooling to gather up petabytes of security relevant data and to very quickly [Matt] Once we have indicators from that one laptop [Tim] We run what's which is, checking literally for these types of indicators. [Narrator] Every. Single. Google machine. Every server and every computer on Google's internal network. [Matt] We find that has downloaded executed something executed something and all of the ways that it into Google, we can [Narrator] They take from the initial breach, the code signatures, domain [indistinct talking] And run them through that scan the entire [Tim] From the billions of logs we'll start to pattern match against our many It actually really boils down of what we call true positives, and that's where we see And from there a human and dig deeper. [Matt] Watching analysts of what happened and one of those professional It's just this and then these nimble and then suddenly it's clear. There's this clear They were gaining a foothold We actually do that the attacker has been [Fatima] We assume the So there's definitely where you just don't know. It's all the unknown. But you have to You really cannot think properly if you're panicked. [Narrator] Sparks are The North Korean government has compromised These hackers are If they get further who knows what they could do. It's time to start [Commentator] This and fire fighting teamwork. Wasted seconds [Tim] The next step is to may still be on the network. Part of that is not that you're onto them. The one thing we don't do is we don't start to shut [Fatima] We don't We don't want them to use a than what we know. So the goal when we're is that we're keeping up into a position that in one step. [Matt] Once we're certain that's when we that are visible [Fatima] We're [Tim] We'll start to try and cut off their [Matt] We yank the rug out all within the same by a group of people [Narrator] They patch every Sometimes that's all it But in the case of like the North [Tim] The only way to assure that a threat does is by actually having a fresh [Fatima] We have to burn and start from scratch. [Matt] Burn it down. Why take the risk that [Tim] I don't like because it's really disruptive. It's a bad day for everybody. [Matt] I love it. [laughs] [explosion booms] [explosion booms] [Narrator] And just like that, the North Korean attackers A campaign that waged by the Detection and Response Only two computers No users were affected, [Fatima] They weren't That's a good moment when that you have put in that it just pays off. [Narrator] And to [Matt] We were able to and the indicators and roll them back into [Narrator] Every the URLs, domain names from the North Korean attack were loaded back into With every fire Google's defenses [Alex] The difference protect itself versus the ones that can't, is having a team that and assuming that the instead of just building and pretending that to keep people from getting in. [Narrator] But these responders when Google's own The teams and protecting against the are the same ones protecting [Royal] Every year the the amount of digital journeys that a consumer will have just exploded, and with it the opportunity for hacking. [Tim] The North Korea attack, the importance of our mission. If you interact with we are here to keep your from those that would [Matt] We really do being protected so much that we have the fire department for your systems and your data. And we're always on duty. [ anthemic music ] [Daniel] My team likes [Heather] The Red Team [Daniel] We basically take and hack into Google. [Niru] The car companies to make sure they're safe. So do we. [Daniel] That you would see for like about a 10th of a second a black window flash [beep] [Niru] Yes, we are in! [laughs]
