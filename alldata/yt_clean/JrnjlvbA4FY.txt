What happened on Saturday? I went back on the drink. Why? I've been sober for a long time Yes, but what good does it do? Why did you start drinking again? Stephen, you have a wife and kid now. Yes. Do they mean nothing to you? They mean a great deal to me. I'm Dirk Van Vuuren. I'm in charge of Filadelfia Ark. Filadelfia Ark is a care centre People who no longer feel at home and who have come here looking for help. For 15 years we've lived that had no regard We started noticing a real decline. Drug dealers had taken over everything. There was no more work for our people. That's when I made the decision to offer them a safe haven. To try and help them escape their That's how Filadelfia Ark started. Filadelfia Ark functions I would say it is That's why everyone here We have farmers here, And a hairdresser too. She cuts the hair How's Steven? Good, good. He's working now. He works from 5 am until 5 pm. Oh, heavens! Are the two of you better? I'm glad. Yes, that's the most important. Circumstances brought me here. I was allowed to stay here, but my daughter had to leave Because of her behaviour. So, I ended up here alone. Is she potty trained yet? No, not yet. At night I put her in a diaper and during the day And then auntie tells me... That I mustn't hit her for that. No, you shouldn't. You have to turn it into a game, sister. Yes, with walking, And she started walking? It looks nice, hey? Yes. Thank you. See you later. Uncle Dirk told me I was staying here. My brother told me: &lt;i&gt;&quot;Yes, you're going &lt;i&gt;&quot;Your things will be sold.&quot;&lt;/i&gt; I told him: I'm the boss of these things. Uncle Dirk said nothing like that &lt;i&gt;"This is the old people's home.&quot;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;&quot;You're already As long as everyone does their share, You understand? Everything fair, you see, If Uncle Dirk says this is how it is, This place belongs to him. He calls the tune Uncle Dirk is a good man. But, brother, he can get angry too. You know. He can get angry too. There's a few rules on the farm. Your room has to be tidy. I don't want a dirty room, Also, I don't want you to be dirty. So, we wash every day here, This is Auntie Madeleen. If you have any problems, All right? Are these the only clothes you have? How many sets of clothes I was given three pairs of trousers, Do you have shoes? Listen to me. You actually ended up here It's our Father You didn't just arrive here by chance. This Father loves you very much. He lets things get difficult, OK? Yes, but like I told Auntie, stuck a knife into my heart Why? I just can't find Just remember, OK? Quiet now, son. Have you heard from Bonnie? She's doing well. She seems to be well. She's only visited once and never called after that. I recently heard she's married. You can't believe I don't see them anymore... But she looks good, you know. I haven't seen her in a very long time. Is Charlene better? Still? She had shaved off all her hair Woaw. I stay away from that. Uncle Dirk's told me that's best. When you live together with So we start with a parade, We do inspections every day. The cabins have to be tidy and clean. We also keep an eye For example, for the young girls Their parents At 8 pm they have to be home. They must never be alone with a man When are we having another karaoke? I don't know. Why have we never Why don't we have a Valentine's day Ball? Uncle Dirk doesn't believe in it. He says, you either love someone, He says that's how men and women Because of Valentine's day? The biggest crisis is employment. The new legislation, is that all farms that work now have to give a 50 percent share Not sell to them, give to them! The worst thing of all is that positions administrative and executive positions, the blacks now want to fill. So you end up at places, where the whites &lt;i&gt;&quot;Because we are too white.&quot;&lt;/i&gt; They don't even want Of course, the levels of criminal activity This is my friend's home. Look how they're forced to live, Within the grounds more fences. It's terrible. The thief's mentality is: &lt;i&gt;&quot;He must have money to put &lt;i&gt;&quot;He must have something to hide. I had a run-in He said: &lt;i&gt;&quot;I'll take your baby &lt;i&gt;&quot;You! Open the safe.&quot;&lt;/i&gt; He said: &lt;i&gt;&quot;Because I want the money.&quot;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;&quot;Because I want the money.&quot;&lt;/i&gt; That's how he spoke. So you can lock yourself in, and his gun or his knife then you just do what he tells you to. They're more for the &lt;i&gt;&quot;Kaffer&lt;/i&gt;s&quot; So it's a dangerous nation, It's a dangerous nation. It's a cross between a jackal It's a dangerous nation, But here, it's safe. It's safe here with us. OK, the tarring group first, then Uncle Peet and his group Dawie, Piet, Armand, Danie, Brian, Sean, Bertus, Jean-Pierre, Phillip, Riaan, Tinus... Johan Mostert. Thank you, Uncle. Adriaan. Hello, Uncle Dirk. Thank you, Uncle Dirk, have a nice day. Mitsy. Ryan. New man. Thanks. Dear Ryan, you're a new man. I don't have to give you anything. That's how you start. If things go well Thank you, Uncle. Have you got a bag, please? No climbing up there. You'll all get a spanking. That's no place to hang off. It would be nice Those TV's cost 1200 rand, It's just missing the remote, That's not a problem. Has Stokkie got his own TV? He's already got his own TV. So that he can When it gets dark we start to work. We start keeping an eye out One night, on patrol like now, I passed a spot and noticed I shone the torch on it. It was an intruder from outside. I called with the radio for back-up. They quickly turned up So far, nothing serious I grew up in the East Rand, Nowadays, people joke It's pretty bleak there. They say dogs go around They're scared the kids will bite them. It's become a really bleak place. We grew up within the Church, My brother and I because we saw Then we began to think... They murder our people, Everyone just says: Then I read other things in the Bible So my brother and I decided But we got caught. My brother and I both I've been here ever since. I want to welcome The farm has slaughtered its first lamb, I'm going to start with a prayer. Thank you, Father, for allowing We ask that You bless our gathering, We praise and we bless You, Amen. Retiefie, how's the meat looking? Good and fatty. Nice. Take that man, who was murdered here, That old black man well, Gary told him: He just said: That was all He was asking for murder. You'll just make enemies White and black mixed together... Yes, it's a disgrace. A disgrace. Rain is coming, friend. &lt;i&gt;Tonight the working people&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;will cut corn, will cut corn...&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;My beloved is hanging in the bush&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;My beloved is hanging in the bush&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;My beloved is hanging &lt;i&gt;There have been tears for you&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Oh my love...&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Read your bible.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Pray every day, &lt;i&gt;Read your bible, pray every day.&lt;/i&gt; Today is our Sabbath, There is something That's the subject Here, in our country, the money is mainly given to to help poor black people Those are the facts. Nobody can say that today there are not Not in South Africa amongst the whites, But that's how it is Let us finish with song 3. &lt;i&gt;May the Master Yeshua &lt;i&gt;And his spirit of charity &lt;i&gt;Our Father, so grand &lt;i&gt;That is His love for you and for me&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;That is His blessing for you and for me&lt;/i&gt; Hallelujah Last Saturday, or the Saturday before, Just a very small amount. Mate, I really felt its effect. Did it go to your head? This one's very light, you know. That's true, Uncle. What's this? A crocodile they shot in the Limpopo. Poor crocodile. Yes, I saw it, We should put crocodiles It's awful how those I saw it this morning Send in snakes and crocodiles. A crocodile has its pride. Well said! Who's not 10 yet? I'm 10, Uncle! I'm 10! Well, you must only swim She waits for her dad. I don't see a political solution. I don't see a military solution. Not even a solution There is only one solution, and that is that this people Criminals rule our country. Criminals on both sides I see no hope for this system. It must fall and it will fall. Do you have children? Yes, two sons. One was in an orphanage, He's still in foster care. But he's very naughty. Their father died. Forwards a bit. That's how I ended up in this situation. I had nowhere else to go, who I felt I could go to, you see? Just remember now Yes, that's what I was going to say.
