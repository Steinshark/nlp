And in no particular order, Flamin' Hot Crunchy, Xxtra Flamin' Hot Crunchy, Buffalo was our surprise. So it's very clear that Crunchy. The original shape of a Cheeto. All right, so I'm glad that we get to Let's eat these first. Yeah, we have to work our way up. So. Just a normal. We'll work our way up to hot to extra hot. So classic. It's got such a crunch.

And then these ran all over Think of the way it's But it wouldn't get there without this. And when you go back to it. Even after you eat this hot stuff, Link, do you want fate to decide? If it lands on red, that's Flamin' Hot. If it lands on black, that's the original. Okay. Yes. We'll let God decide this one. We're saying it's a tie basically. It landed on the green. No, it didn't.
