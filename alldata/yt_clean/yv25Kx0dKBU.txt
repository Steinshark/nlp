A TIME WHEN THE CITY WAS FULL OF &gt;&gt; IT'S AN AGE OF TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF OSTENTATION. &gt;&gt; THIS ARCHITECT AND TASTEMAKER AS BEAUTIFUL AS ANY EUROPEAN CAPITAL. NAMES IN NEW YORK SOCIETY. &gt;&gt; THEY WERE THE RICHEST AND MOST POWERFUL OF THE POLITICAL IN NEW YORK BANKING. THERE WASN'T A PARTY HE DIDN'T IF THERE WAS AN OPENING AT THE OPERA, HE WAS THERE. &gt;&gt; A SHOWMAN WHO GAVE US A GREAT PLEASURE PALACE. &gt;&gt; THIS WAS A COMPLETELY ORIGINAL BUILDING. &gt;&gt; STANFORD WHITE WAS ONE OF AMERICA'S GREATEST ARCHITECTS. &gt;&gt; TREASURES OF NEW YORK &gt;&gt;&gt; AND NOW, HERE'S YOUR HOST, &gt;&gt; HE WAS KNOWN NOT ONLY FOR HIS INCIDENTALLY MURDER. AND SO THE QUESTION WOULD BE WHO IS STANFORD WHITE? I'M SURE YOU DIDN'T SAY WHO IS THE NEXT HOUR. THIS IS A TRULY GREAT AMERICAN WORK, DEDICATION TO GOALS. RICHNESS OF PERSONALITY. MANY COMPELLING STORIES. WE WON'T OMIT THE PART ABOUT THAN LIFE CITIZEN OF AMERICA AND A STORY WELL WORTH YOU'RE SEEING AND HEARING. SOME WOULD CALL IT STRANGER THAN AVENUE, THERE'S A GLORIOUS DESTINATION. ON ITS NORTH END THE PARK IS &gt;&gt; IF YOU WERE TO NAME ONE EVENT. WHETHER IT WAS A PRIVATE CELEBRATION. HE HAD BEEN ASKED BY A COMMITTEE TO HELP ESSENTIALLY DECORATE PARADES. HE ORCHESTRATED THE DECORATION OF THE CITY IN CONNECTION WITH THESE PARADES. WHEN YOU WANTED TO HAVE A GOOD PARADE, YOU GOT AHOLD OF CENTENNIAL OF GEORGE WASHINGTON'S INAUGURATION IN NEW STANFORD WHITE WAS APPOINTED DESIGNED THE ARCH, A TEMPORARY AND STRAW. &gt;&gt; HE EVEN FOUND IN AN ANTIQUE SHOP AN OLD STATUE OF GEORGE AND HE PUT IT ON THE TOP OF THIS HOURS STRINGING THESE JAPANESE LANTERNS FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE, SO YOU MADE THE PASS IN THE CENTENNIAL PARADE, YOU HAD A GLITTERING AND GLORIOUS ARC. &gt;&gt; IT WAS SO POPULAR NEW YORKERS THE STATUE OF LIBERTY. OF ITS DESIGNER, STANFORD WHITE, OF NEW YORK, STANFORD WHITE IS ARCHITECT OF THE 19th AND 20th CENTURIES. VERY FLAMBOYANT. HE HAD RED HAIR, WHAT WE WOULD CALL A CREW CUT. &gt;&gt; STANFORD WHITE WAS A TOWERING FIGURE OF NEW YORK'S GILDED AGE. &gt;&gt; WHITE WAS MOVING SO FAST THAT HE WAS LEAVING BEFORE HE ARRIVED. JUST ALWAYS ON THE GO. ALWAYS OPPORTUNISTIC IN A REALLY &gt;&gt; THROUGHOUT HIS PROLIFIC CAREER, HE WAS FULL OF SURPRISES. LIKE THIS ONE. &gt;&gt; A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THERE'S ACTUALLY A SMALL DOOR ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE ARCH WITH A SPIRAL STAIR THAT TAKES YOU UP TO AN ATTIC SPACE. THAT ATTIC SPACE IS ACTUALLY WASHINGTON ARCH IF YOU LOOK UP WHERE THERE'S AN EAGLE, THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHERE THE FLOOR OF THE ATTIC IS WHERE WE'RE SIMPLY SPECTACULAR IN LIFE AND &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU'RE THE AND YOU GET SHOT BY YOUR OF ONE OF YOUR MOST FAMOUS BUILDINGS, THAT TENDS TO PUT NEW OF ARCHITECTS. WHITE AND SHOT HIM DEAD WITH A SOLID GOLD REVOLVER. &gt;&gt; I DID IT. BECAUSE HE RUINED MY WIFE. &gt;&gt; MORE THAN A CENTURY AFTER HIS FOR THE STORY OF HIS MURDER THAN &gt;&gt; THE STORY OF STANFORD WHITE LIVES THROUGH HIS ART. THE BUILDINGS AND MONUMENTS THAT HE GAVE NEW YORK AND THE NATION. HIS LIFE-LONG EXUBERANCE FOR CELEBRATING ITS UNIQUELY AMERICAN VISION. &gt;&gt; WHITE IS THE FIRST EXEMPLAR FROM EUROPE, BUT HE PUT IT IN THE 1880s, STANFORD WHITE WAS NEW YORK CITY IN 1853 TO JOURNALIST AND SHAKESPEARE &gt;&gt; WHILE STANFORD HAD NO GREAT WEALTH, HE HAD HIS FATHERS WORLD. FRIENDS IN ARTISTIC REALMS, SO HE WAS ABLE TO ASSIST HIS SON. TIFFANY, AND LANDSCAPE ARCHITECT TRAINED AS AN ARCHITECT. &gt;&gt; UNABLE TO AFFORD FORMAL TRAINING, STANFORD BEGAN SHOWING AROUND NEW YORK. APPRENTICE SHIP WITH HENRY ALL THE FORMAL TRAINING THAT SIX YEARS, THAT WAS THE GREATEST TAKING OFF WHEN HIS OFFICE WON A TRINITY CHURCH IN BOSTON'S COPLEY SQUARE, WHITE AND ANOTHER ARCHITECT, CHARLES McKIMM WERE COMPLETED, WHITE TRAVELED TO EUROPE WITH AN INTEREST IN WAS BOOMING WITH WEALTHY NEW YORKERS LOOKING FOR LAVISH WANTED TO EXPRESS THEIR WEALTH AND THEIR STATUS IN A VARIETY OF THE MOST VISIBLE WAY, BECAUSE IT UPWARD ASCENT WHEN THESE &gt;&gt; WHITE RETURNED TO NEW YORK IN 1879, SOUGHT OUT HIS FRIEND FROM PARTNERSHIP WITH WILLIAM RUTHERFORD MEAD. STRENGTHS, BUT THEIR DETECTIVE SKILLS WERE NOT THERE, SO THEY NEEDED SOMEBODY WHO COULD SKETCH FLAIR FOR INTERIORS. &gt;&gt; THE ARCHITECTURAL FIRM OF PRACTICING ARCHITECTURE AT A SUFFICIENTLY COMPLICATED THAT IT THE COLLABORATION OF DIFFERENT DISCIPLINES UNDER THE SINGLE THE PARTNERS WOULD SAY NO WORK ORGANIZATIONS. THEY BECAME THE FIRST REALLY UNITED STATES. MAINLY BY THE TRICK OF RUNNING WITH A ROOM FULL OF TALENTED OFFICE, SO THE PRINCIPLES IN THE &gt;&gt; IN LATE 19th CENTURY AMERICA, SOCIALLY AND PHILOSOPHICALLY VANDERBILT, CORNELIUS VANDERBILT FORTUNE. FINANCE AND CREATING THE COMPANY. ANDREW CARNEGIE COMES TO NEW YORK, BUT HE HAS GREAT STEEL MILLS. THERE'S GREAT MINES IN THE WEST. THERE'S NATURAL RESOURCES, BUT THERE'S ALSO A FINANCIAL AND STEEL. CHURCHES, PUBLIC BUILDINGS AND MONUMENTS. THE FIRM AND ESPECIALLY IT'S CHARISMATIC FRONTMAN, STANFORD WHITE, FOUND A SWEET SPOT. &gt;&gt; HE WORKED FOR ALL THE ROBIN AS THEIR CLIENTS GOT RICHER, THEY PICKED UP NEW CLIENTS AND BECAME THE LEADING ARCHITECTS OF AMERICAN ECONOMY EXPLODED. NEW YORK WAS GOING THROUGH THE COUNTRY WAS. THE COUNTRY HAD BEEN UNITED AT THE END OF THE CIVIL WAR, SO YOU COUNTRY FROM EAST TO WEST. &gt;&gt; AS THE FINANCIAL AND CULTURAL CAPITAL OF THE COUNTRY, NEW YORK CITY CAME TO EPITOMIZE THE &gt;&gt; SO IN NEW YORK, WHILE THESE THE GREAT MONUMENTS WE LIVE WITH ARE BUILT. THE STATUE OF LIBERTY IS CREATED, THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART IS FOUNDED, MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY IS FOUNDED AND BUILT, THE METROPOLITAN OPERA IS FOUNDED AND BUILT. &gt;&gt; BUT ONE CONSEQUENCE OF THIS DISPARITY BETWEEN THE HAVE AND HAVE-NOTS. SATTERIZED IN MARK TWAIN'S NOVEL &quot;THE GILDED AGE&quot; IT DESCRIBES AN SERIOUS SOCIETAL PROBLEMS WERE VEILED, GILDED, YOU MIGHT SAY, UNDER A THIN COAT OF GOLD. &gt;&gt; THAT'S ONE OF THE INTERESTING ONE HAND IT'S LOOKING FORWARD, ELECTRICITY OR PHOTOGRAPHY WHICH EVERYBODY CAN SEE AND USE IN A CERTAIN GROUP OF WEALTHY PEOPLE TRYING TO IMITATE EUROPE. PARTNERS WERE AMONG THE MANY ARCHITECT TO SEE THE CONSPICUOUS THERE WENT A PARTY HE DIDN'T IF THERE WAS AN OPENING AT THE OPERA, HE WAS THERE. HE WAS AT ALL OF THOSE PLACES. &gt;&gt; HE HAD AN EYE FOR THE LADIES. HE HAD A VERY RICH WHIF. SMITH WHO DEEPENED HIS SPHERE OF INFLUENCE. REQUIRED A LOT OF COLLABORATION. BUILDINGS HAD A HUGE AMOUNT OF PACIFIC RAILWAY HIRED McKIM, HOUSES AT 60th AND MADISON EXTRAORDINARY COLLABORATION WITH THE BEST TILE SETTERS, MASONERS, LIGHT FIXTURE DESIGNERS, ALL BEING LED BY STANFORD WHITE TO CREATE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEND VILLARD'S MONEY. &gt;&gt; WHITE'S TEAM INCLUDED ARTISTS SUCH AS AUGUSTUS SINGARDEN AND TOGETHER THEY CREATED AN INTERIOR MASTERPIECE WITH LUSH MOSAICS. &gt;&gt; THOUGH VILLARD LOST HIS MONEY AND HE NEVER OCCUPIED THE HOMES, OWNERSHIP. SPECTACULAR PRIVATE HOMES, AND STANFORD WHITE AS AN &gt;&gt; HE SHOWED HE COULD MANAGE A AND PRODUCE EXTRAORDINARY WORKS. &gt;&gt; NOW THERE WERE NEW AND LARGER PROJECTS FROM THE NEW YORK STOCKING REGIMEN BECAUSE SO MANY OF ITS MEMBERS WERE NEW YORK BLUE BLOODS. STANFORD WHITE WAS AMONG THE ARCHITECTS AND DESIGNERS HIRED TO DECORATE THE BUILDING'S PUTTER TOGETHER OF MATERIALS THAT WAS HIS GREATEST SKILL. HE COULD PUT TOGETHER MARBLE WITH RUGS, WITH PIECES OF METAL, UNIQUE INTERIOR. &gt;&gt; LIKE THE VETERANS ROOM, WHERE WHITE WRAPPED THE SUPPORTING COLUMNS WITH CHAINS. WAY, AS COLLABORATORS WAS CREATE SIGNALS THAT TAKES THE NASTINESS &gt;&gt; SOON THE FIRM BECAME KNOWN AS DESIGNERS OF PRIVATE CLUBS, MANY OF THEM STILL OPERATING TODAY. &gt;&gt; WHITE WOULDN'T HAVE HAD A 1880s AND THOSE CLUBS. &gt;&gt; PRIVATE MENS CLUBS BECAME PROMINENT IN NEW YORK IN THE &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHEN MANY PEOPLE DECIDED HAVING FRIENDS, GOING TO DINNER, HAD A LOT OF MEN AND GOOD BUSINESS CONNECTIONS. THE CLUBS SET THEM UP. &gt;&gt; THE CLUBS WERE GOLD MINES FOR McKIM, MEAD AND WHITE. &gt;&gt; LOOK AT THEIR CLIENTS AND THE THOSE ROSTERS WHERE THEY GOT THE THE EARLY CLUBS WERE HOUSED IN AND WHITE UNDERSTOOD HOW TO MAKE THE BUILDING SORT OF EXPRESS THE FOR ARTISTS. &gt;&gt; SO THAT THE CENTURY ENERGY OF FLORENCE IN 15th CENTURY. AND THEATRICALS, WHICH WHITE RENOVATED AND REDECORATED. AND THE METROPOLITAN CLUB, THE ARE LOOKING AT A POWERHOUSE. COURTYARD SO MEMBERS ARRIVING BY CARRIAGE COULD COME INTO THE ASSAULTED. REASON TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT NAMES IN NEW YORK SOCIETY. &gt;&gt; THEY WERE THE RICHEST AND MOST POWERFUL OF THE POLITICRATS IN EXCHANGE FOR THAT, IT WAS THE AN EXAMPLE OF UNEXCELLED AND THAT IS CERTAINLY A VERY SMALL PRICE TO PAY TO ALLOW SOME POLITICRATS TO GO INTO THEIR &gt;&gt; THIS IS A PERIOD WHERE PEOPLE GAVE UP THE TRADITION OF ENTERTAINING AT HOME EXCLUSIVELY, THEY WOULD HAVE DINNERS IN RESTAURANTS, BALLS, BALLROOMS THAT THEY RENTED SPENT THEIR EVENING. &gt;&gt; STANFORD WHITE NOW TURNED HIS ATTENTION TO CREATING PUBLIC OBSESSED WITH MADISON SQUARE &gt;&gt; MADISON SQUARE GARDEN WAS A GREAT PLEASURE PALACE. MAYBE THE FIRST GREAT PLEASURE PALACE BUILT IN THE UNITED STATES ON A GREEK SCALE. ABUNDANCE OF ORNAMENT. 1870s ON UNTIL THE FIRST WORLD WAR BASICALLY. &gt;&gt; THIS WAS A COMPLETELY THIS TOGETHER. DESIGNING THE BUILDING, HE &gt;&gt; WHITE HIMSELF IN ONE OF HIS HE WAS LIKE A ZIGFELD. &gt;&gt; HE WANTED TO HAVE ALL THE USUAL THINGS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE AT AN ENTERTAINMENT PALACE BUT HE WENT ABROAD AND LOOKED AT HIPPODRONES IN LONDON AND PARIS, OLD STUFF OF THE OLD NEW YORK. &gt;&gt; LIKE HORSE SHOWS, AUTO SHOWS, GREAT ROOMS AND A ROOF TOP TERRACE. &gt;&gt; A NIGHTCLUB IN THE SKY. EUROPE, SO STANFORD WHITE GAVE NEW YORK ONE OF ITS OWN. AND SPECTACULAR THAT EVERYBODY WAS FLOERED. ON THE OPENING DAY, PEOPLE SAT ABOVE THEM, AND THEY PRESSED THE AND VERY SLOWLY AND SILENTLY THE ROOF LEFT THE SPACE. THE SKY. TOWER. THE TOWER WAS NOT IN THE &gt;&gt; THE TOWER WAS MODELED AFTER A SURPRISE WITH HIS FRIEND AND &gt;&gt; WHEN THAT COLLABORATION REACHED A POPULAR LEVEL IN CONNECTION WITH THIS STATUE, DESIGNED TO GO ON THE TOP OF &gt;&gt; DIANA, A PAGAN GODDESS OF THE &gt;&gt; WHEN IT WAS FIRST CREATED THIS STATUE WAS MADE IN AN HOISTED UP TO THE TOP OF THE AND EVERYBODY STOOD BACK AND AT FIRST THEY WERE SHOCKED ON A PIECE OF PUBLIC SCULPTURE THE BASE OF THE STATUE, IT WAS QUITE HIGH UP, ABOUT 350 FEET IN THE AIR. IT WAS EVERYBODY'S FAVORITE PART OF NEW YORK. CAPITAL. NEW YORK UNIVERSITY. &gt;&gt; JUST A BUILDING THAT IS A EVERY PART OF IT YOU LOOK AT WHITE GIFTS TO THE OBSERVER. &gt;&gt; THE MEMORIAL LIBRARY, THE JEWEL IN THE CROWN OF WHAT WAS WHITE CREATED A PASTORAL U-SHAPED PLAN, THE LIBRARY COMPLETED IN 1903 WAS AT ITS IT WAS REALLY OVERWHELMING THE QUITE KNOWING WHAT I WAS GOING ROTUNDA. &gt;&gt; ONE OF THE THINGS THEY WERE MOST INTENT ON IS CREATING A THEY DIDN'T WANT TO CREATE A GRAND OVERPOWERING URBAN WORKED IN THE LANDSCAPE. IT'S BUILT OUT OF A SOFT COLORED THE LANDSCAPE. IT WAS DESIGNED AS THE CENTERPIECE OF THE CAMPUS. A UNIVERSITY THAN HAVING A LIBRARY AT THE CENTER. &gt;&gt; MODELED AFTER THE PANTHEON IN HIGH ON A HILL OVERLOOKING THE THAT WOULD GO AROUND THE LIBRARY WHERE STUDENTS AND FACULTY COULD COME AND WALK, LOOK AT VIEWS PALISADES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IN THE LATE 1890s THEY DECIDED WHY NOT JUST MAKE IT SOMETHING SPECIAL? WHY JUST HAVE AN AMBULATORY? THEY WOULD TURN IT INTO A HALL OF FAME FOR GREAT AMERICANS. THAT'S WHAT IT BECAME. &gt;&gt; A HALL FOR GREAT AMERICAN MEN INCLUDING GEORGE WASHINGTON, ABRAHAM LINCOLN, AND WHITE'S THE FLOWING AMBULATORY AND THE MUTED STRAW-COLORED BRICKS BELIE WHAT A VISITOR DISCOVERS &gt;&gt; STANFORD WHITE WAS VERY, VERY CONSCIOUS OF DRAWING PEOPLE INTO SEE OUTSIDE. BEAUTY AND LUSHNESS OF THE YOU APPROACH THE LIBRARY DOWN AN ALLEY OF TREES THAT LEADS TO THE THROUGH THE PORTICO OF THE LIBRARY. THEN INTO A VERY LOW-SCALE REVOLVING DOOR, AND STRAIGHT AHEAD OF SU THIS SPECTACULARLY GRAND RENAISSANCE-INSPIRED STAIRCASE. STAIRS TO DISCOVER WHAT'S REALLY THERE AND WHAT WILL BE THE CULMINATION OF THIS LONG FILLED WITH BOOKS. READ AT TABLES IN THE ROTUNDA, SURROUNDING THE ROTUNDA IS A GROUP OF SMALL PRIVATE OFFICES CALLED SEMINARY ROOMS, WHERE EACH ACADEMIC FIELD. &gt;&gt; THERE WOULD BE A SEMINARY ALL THE BOOKS FOR THAT HOME-LIKE FEELING IN THE DEPARTMENT IN WHICH THEY MAJORED. &gt;&gt; EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK YOU WOULD SEE BOOKS. BEHIND THE BOOK THERE'S WERE ROOMS. IN ORDER TO GET INTO THE INTO THE ROOMS BEHIND. &gt;&gt; 16 COLUMNS OF IRISH MARBLE, &gt;&gt; YOU SEE THE MARBLE COLUMNS. YOU LOOK UP. DOME THAT HAS COFFERS WITH FLOWERED ROSETTES IN IT. STATUES IN THE ROMAN CLASSICAL TRADITION. WHITE'S FRIENDS, PEERS SAID THIS IS THE BUILDING WHERE WE WANT TO PUT A MEMORIAL TO WHITE. AFTER THE TURN OF THE CENTURY, AS ARCHITECTURAL TASTES BEGAN TO CHANGE, STANFORD WHITE, EVER THE ENTREPRENEUR BEGAN TO REINVENT &gt;&gt; STANFORD WHITE'S INTERESTS AS A DECORATOR WERE AT A COUPLE BEAUTIFUL, HE HAD AN EYE TO SPOT THESE OBJECTS OF BEAUTY. THOUGHT WERE NOT COMBINABLE. &gt;&gt; WHITE WOULD NOT BE LIMITED BY THE CONSTRAINTS OF DETECTIVE WITH A EUROPEAN HUNTING LODGE. AN OUTDOOR FOUNTAIN INDOORS. A MOOSE HEAD SURROUNDED BY CHERUBS. DIDN'T LIKE. AND BUY FURNITURE AND THINGS LIKE THAT, BUT THEN HE WOULD FURNITURE, TAPESTRY, OTHER PIECES, THINGS HE HAD ACQUIRED IN EUROPE. BEAUTIFUL PANELLED ROOM THAT WAS NOW THEY WERE ABLE TO SECURE MAN. WANTED BUT ABLE TO HELP THEM BUY &gt;&gt; PARIES FOR FAMOUS CLIENTS WHO ATTENDED WHITE'S OWN PARTIES, MANY OF WHICH WERE HELD AT WHITE'S HOME ON LONG ISLAND OVERLOOKING THE SOUND. &gt;&gt; IN THE CITY, STILL IF YOU WERE ON 5th AVENUE, IT WAS SO, THE NEW YORK HOME WOULD BE WHERE YOU HAD YOUR EVENTS DURING NEWPORT. WOULD GO TO THE NORTHERN SHORE HOMES. &gt;&gt; WHITE CALLED HIS COUNTRY HOME &gt;&gt; STANFORD WHITE DID GIVE BIG THE SUMMER AND SPRING AND FALL SO, THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE &gt;&gt; BESSIE WHITE KEPT A RECORD OF EVERY WEEKEND GUEST. &gt;&gt; SOME PRETTY FANCY PEOPLE SHOW STANFORD WHITE WAS USING BOX OF McKIM, MEAD AND WHITE SHOW UP &gt;&gt; IT IS A DUTCH DOOR, IT OPENS. &gt;&gt; SAM WHITE, STANFORD'S GREAT MANY A CHILDHOOD DAYS. THE UNUSUAL TREATMENT OF THE HOME'S EXTERIOR. &gt;&gt; THE TEXTURE ON THE WALLS OF PAINTED FARMHOUSE. WHITE ENLARGED THE HOME BIT BY &gt;&gt; HE DECIDED TO COVER THE HOUSE PEBBLE DASH, ESSENTIALLY BEACH PRESSED INTO WET CEMENT SET ON WIRE LATH. &gt;&gt; THIS WAS TYPICAL OF WHITE'S &gt;&gt; JUST PICKS UP THE LIGHT WONDERFULLY. CHARACTER. TEXTURE, PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE FRONT HALL. THIS WAS ONE OF THE THREE FORMAL STANFORD WHITE WAS QUITE REPURPOSING. WERE MADE FOR THE MORGAN LIBRARY IN NEW YORK. SATISFIED, WANTED SOMETHING OF A STANFORD WHITE WAS MORE THAN HAPPY TO TAKE THE REJECTS. &gt;&gt; ON THE WALLS, ANOTHER UNEXPECTED MATERIAL -- INTERESTING. STANFORD WHITE WAS INTERESTED IN UNUSUAL MATERIALS, NOT BECAUSE QUALITIES. MUST HAVE COST ABOUT $10.50 TO DO THE WHOLE ROOM AND USED IT AS WALLPAPER. &gt;&gt; BOX HILL IS A WINDOW INTO IMAGINATION. &gt;&gt; EXTRAORDINARY COLLECTION OF ARTIFACTS FROM DIFFERENT CULTURES, DIFFERENT PERIODS. YOU HAVE THE BED WARMING PANS, WHICH ARE THIS ELEMENT FROM 17th THE ELEMENTS, THEY LOOK LIKE GIANT FRYING PANS, YOU WOULD THEM TO TAKE THE CHILL OFF THE STANFORD WHITE LOVED THE DETECTIVE QUALITY OF THIS. CAME FROM OR WHAT COUNTRY. HE IS JUXTAPOSING THAT AGAINST AT THE BOTTOM YOU HAVE THE LIONS THE FIREPLACE AT THE FAR END IS, 17th OR 18th CENTURY ITALIAN ANTIQUE. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT SOME OF SOME OF IT WAS CREATED TO PULL THE ORIGINAL PIECES TOGETHER STANFORD WHITE HAD ACCESS TO EXTRAORDINARY CRAFTSMEN WHO WERE CRAFTSMEN. CARVERS, PEOPLE WHO COULD WORK THINGS THAT ARE NOT COMPLETELY &gt;&gt; WE ARE IN THE LIVING ROOM FAMILY CALLS THE BAROQUE ROOM. IT IS THE OLDEST PART OF THE HOUSE. THIS ROOM SHOWS NOT ONLY A TASTE OF STANFORD WHITE, THIS INTEREST ARE COVERED IN SEA GRASS AND COVERING IS USED AS IF IT WERE A ARRANGES IT IN PANELS. THE MANTLE PIECE IS EITHER FRENCH OR ITALIAN RENAISSANCE. &gt;&gt; HOLDS POTS NEAR THE FIRE. &gt;&gt; AN ORNAMENT TAKEN FROM AN SECOND LIFE. THINGS, A SWAN IS A PRETTY ORDINARY ANIMAL. YOU SEE THEM OUT HERE IN THE BIZARRE OR MILDLY THREATENING. &gt;&gt; AND THE CHANDELIER FROM &gt;&gt; THE COMBINATION OF THE FIGURE ANTLERS. THIS IS REAL STANFORD WHITE. HE JUST LOVED THIS TOTALLY BIZARRE COMBINATION. THIS IS THE ORIGINAL DINING ROOM THIS WAS BUILT BY WHITE IN THE ADDED THE DINING ROOM. HOUSE WAS BUILT FOR. BATHED IN LIGHT, WITH HUNDREDS OF DELFT TILES FROM HOLLAND. EXPENSIVE. IF HE GOT THEM NOW, THEY WOULD BE VERY EXPENSIVE. GREAT FIREPLACE. THAT WAS HIS GENIUS, THAT HE HE HAD SUCH A FLAIR. YOU'RE ACTUALLY A LITTLE JEALOUS &gt;&gt; STANFORD WHITE WAS 46 YEARS CENTURY. EXCESSIVE. &gt;&gt; SO HE MADE MONEY ON THESE ITEMS. BUT NOT ENOUGH TO SAVE HIM FINANCIALLY. CLIENTS, WHITE WAS OVEREXTENDED. STATES, MANY OF HIS PRINCIPLED FIRST DECADE OF THE 20th CENTURY AS HE DID, FLYING TOO CLOSE TO THE SUN AND MELTING THEIR VERY FRAGILE WINGS. &gt;&gt; STANFORD WHITE WAS ON THE ROPES BASICALLY AT THE TIME OF HIS DEATH. HE HAD SIGNIFICANT DEBT. MANHATTAN DESTROYED NEARLY ALL &gt;&gt; WHITE OWED TERRIBLE LARGE BECAUSE HE OWED SO MUCH MONEY TO THE EXUBERANCE HE ONCE EXPRESSED ARCH GAVE WAY TO A MORE MODERATE &gt;&gt; STANFORD WHITE IS NOT GIVEN SERIOUSLY. TOWARDS MORE RESTRAINT AS HE &gt;&gt; PERHAPS THE BEST EXAMPLE OF MONUMENT IN BROOKLYN'S FT. GREEN &gt;&gt; IT'S A DRAMATIC VIEW AS YOU ENTER FROM THE CORNER OF ST. CRYPTS IN THE MIDDLE, WHICH IS 148 FEET HIGH ON A HILL. THE FT. GREEN MARTYRS MEMORIAL IS A MEMORIAL TO THE &gt;&gt; DURING THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION, MORE THAN 10,000 PRISONERS OF WAR DIED IN CAPTIVITY ON BOARD BRITISH PRISON SHIPS DOCKED OFF WHAT WAS WERE PRESERVED AND ARE KEPT IN IT'S BEEN SAID THAT IT WAS WORKING ON THE NIGHT THAT HE DIED LATE IN THE OFFICE. PUT THE PEN DOWN, YOU KNOW, WENT TO THE THEATER, LITERALLY IT WAS THE LAST MONUMENT. &gt;&gt; IT WAS JUNE 25, 1906. THAT EVENING, STANFORD WHITE NESBI IT WAS AN ARTIST MODEL AND CHORUS GIRL AND STANFORD WHITE'S AFTER THE AFFAIR ENDED, EVELYN MARRIED HARRY K. THAW, WHO HAD OBSESSED ENOUGH TO STALK WHITE THE STALKING ENDED THAT NIGHT ON WHITE, PULLED OUT A GUN AND SHOT STANFORD WHITE WAS JUST 52 YEARS OLD. WHAT FOLLOWED WAS THE NATION'S MURDER, BUT IT WAS THE DETAILS FASCINATED THE PUBLIC. THE PRESS ATE IT UP. WHENEVER THOUGHT OF STANFORD WHITE, THEY THOUGHT OF THE SCANDAL AS PLAYED OUT IN THE TRIAL WHERE THE TRIAL WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TRIALS IN WHICH THEY TRIAL AND STANFORD WHITE WAS THE SENSE. THIS SILENT FILM AND RELEASED IT BEFORE HIS MURDER TRIAL ENDED IN A HUNG JURY. THAW CHANGED HIS PLEA TO HE WAS CONVICTED AND SPENT THE NEXT SEVEN YEARS IN A NEW JERSEY MEANTIME STANFORD WHITE'S FAMILY WAS FORCED TO SELL WHAT REMAINED AUCTION, JUST TO PAY OFF HIS DEBTS. WHITE'S REPUTATION AS AN ARCHITECT WAS FOREVER TARNISHED. &gt;&gt; THIS KIND OF EXUBERANCE WAS PEOPLE DIDN'T WANT IT ANYMORE. THEN ULTIMATELY THE -- THE MODERN MOVEMENT IN AMERICA LACK OF VITALITY IN TERMS OF REPUTATION PRETTY MUCH DISAPPEAR. MARTYR'S MEMORIAL, WAS COMPLETED AFTER HIS DEATH. McKIM AND MEAD CONTINUED SCANDAL AND CHANGING TIMES CAUSED THEIR BUSINESS TO SUFFER. BECOMES INCREASINGLY TROUBLING TO PEOPLE. CERTAINLY BY THE TURN OF THE CENTURY AND THE BEGINNING OF THE INEQUALITY HAD TO BE SOLVED IN &gt;&gt; THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE GILDED AGE WAS NOW OUT OF FAVOR. &gt;&gt; PEOPLE SAID REALLY TERRIBLE WHITE. MEN AS NOT INTERPRETERS OF EUROPEAN TRADITION, BUT RATHER MERE COPYISTS. THEY REALLY CAME TO HATE THEM. FITTING IT FOR AMERICA, THAT WORLD, A NEW TIME, AND THEY WERE NOT COPYING ONE BUILDING AFTER ANOTHER AFTER ANOTHER. IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THE GREAT MUNICIPAL BUILDING BEHIND CITY HALL IN LOWER MANHATTAN, THE FIRM WOULD HAVE BEEN RUINED AS &gt;&gt; NEW YORK CITY'S MUNICIPAL ALSO DESIGNED THE ORIGINAL PENNSYLVANIA STATION AND THE JAMES FARLEY POST OFFICE, BUT AS BUILDINGS WENT UP, OTHERS CAME PROHIBITION, WHICH WAS IMPOSED PLEASURE OUT OF WHITE'S PLEASURE &gt;&gt; A SISTER IN BRONZE NOW GRACES THE GARDENS OF BOX HILL, STANFORD WHITE'S SUMMER HOME WHICH REMAINS IN THE FAMILY. FOR A WHILE WHITE'S LIBRARY, WAS IN JEOPARDY. &gt;&gt; FORTUNATELY THE CITY WAS ABLE TO ACQUIRE IT AND CONVERT IT APARTMENT BUILDINGS OR THE &gt;&gt; IN 2012 ROBERT A.M. STERN CAMPUS RIGHT NEXT TO THE ONE STANFORD WHITE CREATED MORE THAN THE OTHER BUILDINGS THAT THE ON THE CAMPUS. &gt;&gt; STERN'S IS A GREAT ACADEMIC OF BRONX COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND TO THE CITY OF NEW YORK. &gt;&gt; I THINK IT'S THRILLING. I HEARD IT FROM SO MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN THERE. STUDENTS ARE SO THRILLED TO HAVE HELP NOTIING THE ARCHITECT'S ESTEEM FOR STANFORD WHITE. SMILE. &gt;&gt; WE THINK HE WOULD SMILE, TOO, &gt;&gt; EVERY TIME YOU WALK DOWN TO AND SEE THAT ARCH, THAT IS THE AMERICAN ARCHITECTURE. CENTURY. &gt;&gt; THE IDEA THAT NEW YORK WAS AN A GLOBAL ECONOMIC FORCE AND IT NEEDED TO HAVE AN URBAN FABRIC THAT DIGNIFIED ITS POSITION IN THE WORLD ECONOMY. I THINK THAT McKIM, MEAD AND CITY THEIR CITY, A WORLD CLASS ON PAR WITH PARIS AND WITH BY EXTENSION TO MAKE AMERICA A WORLD CLASS COUNTRY ON THE WORLD STAGE WITH FRANCE AND WITH ENGLAND. WAS NOW A CITY COMPARABLE TO THEY LIVED HERE, THEY WORKED &gt;&gt; IN DEATH SOMETIMES PEOPLE BECOME MYTHIC. AND THERE COULD BE A COMPONENT OF THAT TO STANFORD WHITE. THAT'S WHY IT'S ALWAYS SAID THAT YORK CITY PARKS AND THROUGHOUT THE CITY, THERE IS NO MONUMENT TO THE FIRM OF McKIM, MEAD AND WHITE, THEY ALWAYS STATED THAT &gt;&gt;&gt; A PERSONAL NOTE, YEARS AGO I FOUND A GREAT OLD HOUSE ON THE SEA ON EASTERN LONG ISLAND, IT AND AN ARCHITECT FRIEND DROVE UP WHITE HOUSE. I DID. UNIDENTIFIED IN THE ATTIC. AN OLD-TIMER VISITING ME SAID, AH, EVELYN NESBIT.
