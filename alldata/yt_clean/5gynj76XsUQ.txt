And by the end of it, how you can play a critical role (intriguing music) Alright, we made it to Kibumba. Whew. <i> Because the area surrounding <i> is largely controlled <i> and their activity <i> even Kibumba, <i> falls under strict lockdown,</i> <i> and armed guards (birds chirping) <i> At first light, we gear up</i> <i> and prepare to ascend <i>We'll need to bushwhack our way <i>to search for signs of gorillas.</i> <i> But to be clear, <i> there are no fences <i> This is the domain <i> and most dominant <i> We're led by Papa Didi</i> <i> and Papa Augustine,</i> <i> two of the highest-ranking This is an armed-ranger detail, because we could potentially but more likely so, And that's one of the main population of mountain gorillas.

Okay. right around this bend here. This is the moment we travelled not only to the Congo but seven years of adventures (chuffing, rustling) (whispering): There's a gorilla It's right here. (suspenseful music) (chuffing) My hands are shaking. My heart is beating (wild screaming) Oh, my gosh. - They are furious. Oh, my gosh. Film his face. Oh, my gosh. Okay, that was insane. The two silverbacks were fighting for dominance, and you could see where there's The subdominant silverback (low growl) Oh, whoa. <i> That was definitely <i>for our first gorilla encounter,</i> <i>despite the fact I've been told</i> <i> gorilla can be aggressively It's a baby gorilla. <i> ...and will viciously protect <i> if provoked.</i> (man): Mark, turn around, (gorilla growling softly) (whispering): (suspenseful music) We're gonna get closer.

Forty-four gorillas This... is the biggest gorilla <i> As the dominant male <i> Bageni calls the shots.</i> <i>He's responsible for determining <i> choosing its daily activities,</i> <i>and fathering the vast majority (whispering) (low growl) Must weigh over 400 pounds.

And you know, there's been on the part of Virunga's we have to succeed. There's a terrible attack just over this area - When it comes to and the militias, why did they choose Virunga? - You know, it's a civil war then the Rwandan genocide but what's kept them here of natural resources in particular, And there you'll see - Yeah.
