Puglia. The heel of the Italian boot is a territory rich in history, traditions and wonderful landscapes. This land, bathed by the Adriatic and Ionian Seas, has among its riches many small villages, which are true pearls of authenticity, characterized by narrow stone streets, arches and whitewashed houses. In this video, we will delve into the alleys of some of the most fascinating villages in Puglia, discovering their roots, traditions and the natural beauty that surround them, on a journey that celebrates the magic and uniqueness of this splendid region. We start from Polignano a Mare, in the province of Bari. This village, located about 33 km from the capital, is a real jewel, set in the limestone rock. Characterized by stone balconies that overlook directly onto the blue sea, Polignano is the ideal place for photography lovers and for those looking for captivating views. In the historic center, you can find small local craft shops, bars and restaurants where you can taste typical Apulian cuisine. And for adventure lovers, there is nothing better than a dive from its cliffs. A special mention certainly goes to Grotta Palazzese, a natural cave, dug by the action of the sea, which houses a luxury restaurant inside. Continuing, we focus on Ostuni. Also known as the white city, it is one of the most famous and photographed cities in Puglia. Its historic center, completely painted in white, shines in the sun, creating a fascinating contrast with the green of the olive groves and the blue of the sea in the distance. Walking through its alleys, you have the impression of being in a labyrinth of narrow streets, stairways and small squares. In addition to the beauty of its historic center, Ostuni is famous for the production of extra virgin olive oil. The ancient farms, scattered throughout the surrounding countryside, offer guided tours and tastings, where you can discover the oil production process, and savor the authentic taste of this green gold. Furthermore, a short distance from Ostuni, there are the beaches of Torre Guaceto, a protected natural reserve, with very clear waters and golden sand dunes. Let's now discover Alberobello. Immersed in the heart of Puglia, it is one of the most emblematic villages in Italy, famous for its characteristic houses called trulli. These small conical buildings, built entirely of stone without the use of mortar, represent a unique example of folk engineering and architecture. Their origin is shrouded in legends and historical tales, but one thing is certain, they offer tangible evidence of man's ability to adapt to the environment using available resources. Walking through the streets of Alberobello, you can perceive the magic of a bygone time. Many trulli have been transformed into craft shops, cafes or tourist accommodation. The Church of Sant'Antonio, also built like a trullo, should be visited and we recommend taking part in one of the many traditional festivals, which celebrate local culture and gastronomy. Continuing in the heart of the Itria Valley, we find Locorotondo, a village with a bright appearance and a peculiar shape. As the name suggests, the historic center has a circular structure, which offers tourists a suggestive route, among white alleys and flowered balconies. This structure makes the town unique, offering 360 degree panoramic views of the valley below, carpeted with olive trees, vineyards and trulli. Locorotondo is known not only for its architectural beauty, but also for its winemaking tradition. The surrounding area produces some of the best white wines in Puglia, known for their freshness and aroma, such as Verdeca and Bianco d'Alessano. Looking out over the Ionian Sea, however, we find Gallipoli, one of the pearls of Salento. The etymology of its name, deriving from Greek, means Beautiful City, and this alone tells a lot about its intrinsic charm. The division between the new city and the historic center, located on an island, makes Gallipoli a place of surprising contrasts between modernity and antiquity, between frenzy and tranquility. Walking along its stone streets, you can smell the scent of the sea mixing with that of fresh fish, sold in the markets that enliven the squares. The baroque churches, with their elaborate facades, tell centuries of history and faith. Among these, the Cathedral of Sant'Agata is a must for anyone visiting the city. Not far away, however, the Angioino Castle offers a panoramic view of the sea and the city. The golden beaches, such as the famous Baia Verde, are ideal for those seeking relaxation under the sun, while at night, the city comes alive with clubs and discos, making it one of the favorite destinations for young people. We continue with Cisternino, in the Itria Valley. it is a true pearl of the Apulian hinterland. Characterized by an intimate and welcoming historic center, with narrow streets and white houses, the village offers panoramic views that range over the trulli and centuries-old olive groves of the valley below. But Cisternino is not just a place of scenic beauty, its gastronomic culture is equally fascinating. The butchers in the town offer customers a wide choice of meats, they choose the one they prefer, and see it cooked on the spot, ready to be enjoyed. not far from the renowned Polignano a Mare, stands Monopoli, a city full of charm and history. Its maritime origin is evident. the port, always bustling with activity, is a constant coming and going of fishermen, who, upon returning from fishing, sell their fresh fish. The imposing walls surrounding the port tell stories of invasions and naval battles, testimony to a time when Monopoli was a bulwark against incursions from the sea. The historic center, however, is a labyrinth of stone streets, dotted with historic churches and lively squares. The sandy beaches, such as that of Cala Porta Vecchia, offer an oasis of relaxation, while in the evening, the clubs and restaurants along the seafront come alive, attracting tourists looking for fun. we reach the Gargano peninsula, and visit Vieste. with its white houses and narrow alleys, it establishes itself as an obligatory stop in Puglia. Its golden beaches, such as Spiaggia del Castello, are an invitation to enjoy the sea and the sun. But what really distinguishes Vieste are its fascinating rock formations that emerge from the sea. The most famous of these is Pizzomunno, a limestone monolith which, according to local legend, represents a young fisherman transformed into stone due to an unfortunate love affair. In the Apulian hinterland, far from the frenzy of the coastal resorts, is Pietramontecorvino. a village that seems to have stopped in time. Its stone streets, arches, medieval towers create a magical atmosphere, making tourists feel as if they have stepped back in time. The Ducal Palace and the Mother Church are just some of the architectural gems that the town has to offer. Furthermore, the village is located on a hill and offers incredible views of the surrounding nature, a panorama of hills, woods and fields that extend as far as the eye can see. On the eastern border of Puglia, where the Adriatic meets the Ionian, stands Otranto, an ancient city with irresistible charm. Its geographical position has made it a crossroads of cultures, trade and invasions over the centuries. The imposing walls of its castle, the Aragonese Castle, tell stories of heroism and sieges, of battles and resistance. This fortress, with its imposing towers and bastions, has been the city's defense against invaders for centuries. But Otranto is not just a story of battles. The Cathedral of Santa Maria Annunziata is a true jewel of sacred art. Furthermore, walking along the Otranto seafront means immersing yourself in splendid and romantic views, where the intense blue of the sea merges with the sky, and where the sunset seems to dye everything gold. Finally, let's go up the Adriatic coast and immerse ourselves in the heart of the Gargano National Park. we meet Peschici, a village with an authentic Mediterranean flavour. Its white houses, clinging to the cliffs, seem to defy the laws of gravity. while the streets, narrow and winding, they lead tourists into a labyrinth of sensations, smells and colours. Every corner of the village is a discovery, and even the Castle, which dominates the village from above, is an ideal place to enjoy the 360 degree panorama of the Gargano and the sea below. The Peschici marina, with its sandy beaches and clear waters, is an invitation to relax and have fun, especially during the hot summer days.
