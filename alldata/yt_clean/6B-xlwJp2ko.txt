Today we're trying even more Let's talk about that. Good Mythical Summer. In this crazy world that we live in, there's really only one Yes. At the end of the day, we all look up at the same moon and stars, which reminds us that we are all and we are all, so small. I was just gonna say that but that's pretty good, too. Yeah. It's time for Where in the World Do These Part Two. Okay, you're going to be tasting candies your darts at the map where you The winner will have seven thousand to his charity donation total. And of course, there's a not so sweet punishment But what is so sweet is that Chase, toot. He's a sweet toot. Sweet toot. I brought the fart from Chase. The sweet toothed cartographer But I'm gonna be thinking Chase, did you prep any toot puns? I will work on some toot puns right now. It's all candy and toothpaste. Okay, we get it all. All right, and last time I did this, I had to use fries. And since I did so well. Well, but I came as close as You were very accurate, though. I have elected to stick Okay. I think that's a good choice. And, you did eke out a win last time, and Link, because you were such we're bringing back an advantage for you. It's a nostalgic advantage from the fart. Toot. Yeah. And a fart? Which was four darts, That's a good advantage. What do we have here? Stretchy, soury. Gummy You smelled it, which made me smell it. Or did I just think you were smelling Floral. Floral. Sour. Sour, sweet. Tangy, stretchy. Illicit. Vibrant. You doubt it? I doubt it. We don't have illicit stuff on this show, No. No, no. Look at this beautiful map. There's all types of countries on it. Matter of fact, every country that's on Prove me wrong. Look at my little wisdom tooth. Thank you. Except Antarctica. That's not a country. That's a continent, and a country. Oh, you got me. Rhett, you go first. Okay. Boy, I tell you one thing, boy. Boy. These candy ones, Link. I'm just gonna tell you, if there's ever a time for you to in this game, it is when we're doing Because I have no idea. There's no spice that I I cannot use my culinary insights to come to any conclusions. Because I just taste a sweet, floral, Candy. Candy. Falkland Islands. It's gotta be Falkland I think this might just be like, yeah, candies in the United Kingdom. You know what I'm saying? Isn't it? Seems kind of boring. It's a sour patched strip which it makes it illicit. See? Somebody who doesn't, isn't willing to go to artificial coloring lengths. And I know I've got some experience And they will go very bright in here in the United States. We don't care. Give us all the artificial you can. UK, they hold back on that sometimes because of that European influence, Link. That is a good dart. Oh, good dart. I mean, it certainly tastes though. But it doesn't have of a Mexican candy. I think this is. I'm gonna say Portugal. Okay. Okay. Okay. That went high. I thought it was heavier than it was. What is that? What even is that? One of the lands? Greenland or Iceland or something? No, that's neither. It's higher than both of those. I met an actual cartographer on tour. I'll ask him after this. I think it's part of the Arctic Circle. I think it. But is it? What country is that? We don't even know what That's not a country. We don't know. It's okay. It's not where this candy is from. Okay. You just had Bourbon fettuccine gummies, despite their proximity to pasta, They also contain zero Bourbon is merely the brand name in nineteen twenty-four in Japan. Rhett, I gave you the answer. Dude. Man, you could have totally taken me out, Link. Well, how could I have known? All right, taste buds. Rhett, you had forty-two. Link forty-five. Oh, man. This is. We're up there. Green hard candy. Well, I'm glad there's more. It's stuck to my finger in a way. My initial impression is negative. Is there? What? What? I told you it was negative. Oh, you're chewing it. Is it? There's something.? What's inside of it? Oh, man. It's savory. Oh, it's horrible. It tastes like, Is there meat in it? I see no visual evidence of Oh, my gosh. What a strange combination of flavors. So I let you beat me by just a you could keep going first. What was that? I let you beat my cup of &quot;slim-timeters&quot;, &quot;Slim-timeters&quot;. Those are extra slim. The slimmest of margins. Those are &quot;slim-timeters&quot;. Let me buy a couple &quot;slim-timeters&quot;, man. Did you eat a second one? Are you serious, dude? The outside is tantalizing. And then when you bit it. It's gross in there. What is that? It's bad, bad, bad news. It's a spice I've never encountered. Putrid fish spice. Like, it tastes like. I've always wondered what it would. A Venus flytrap that had a fly that taste like if you were to pop There it is. And this is it. Like, it tastes stinky. It tastes like a fly. Half a fly body. It's got some liquid that's I kind of like it. What you thinking? I think it might be some sort of chili. So it could be, like, a Mexico Peru thing. And it's very bright. Already established that. I thought that that Maybe Japan again. I don't think they can do that. I don't think they can either. It's against the rules. I'm just going. You know what? I'm not playing it safe. There's only two countries over there. There's a lot of countries I am playing it safe though. I'm aiming right in between them. Or right there. Okay. You know what? We discovered that the archipelago that I hit in the first round. Chase, point that out again, is Svalbard. Svalbard. Which is an archipelago of Norway. Yeah. And I actually think that that's where this is from. Oh, because it's got, like, a fishy taste? Yeah, because there's a fishy taste in it. And they like the fishy, nasty, Up there in Norway. It tastes like a fish melon. Yeah, like a fish melon. Don't want that one. I'm gonna have to be more direct in my. In my fry darting. I'm making more of a blunt tip. Is that acceptable? He's modifying the fries. If you wanna eat some of your dart, Phish melon is my favorite Blind, Blind Melon and Phish combined cover band. It's a great combo. I'm going for Norway. Blind Melon. When was the last time And I am splitting the diff between. It doesn't rain. So here we go. Fall hard! Nope. A little bit to the left, but that's okay. You just had Pass Pass Pulse, a hard candy filled with including amchoor, unripe mangoes that's samosas, curries, and chutneys throughout India. Okay. Now that I'm.

These fries are doing it for me, man. If you told me that this was Milka chocolate. You know, the purple one? Yeah. From Europe. Good brand. I think it's, like a Swedish. So you're talking Norwegian, I guess. But maybe it's, symbolic of London Bridge, you know what happened to London Bridge, It's falling down. There's a history lesson in So that's where I'm going.
