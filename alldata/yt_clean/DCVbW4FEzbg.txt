In race one, the GT500 was But the Z06's it transfer weight quicker Team Chevy hit 60 and on an unprepped the wheelspin-happy Mustang It also ran a 10.7 versus the Mustang's 11.5. The turnaround saw both cars But the Corvette kept In the end, the Z06 finished in at 32.1. The Shelby's finishing speed higher, at 148.5. With a longer straightaway, in the Z06, but not this time. Race two was a similar Now, you could argue that just barely. But it didn't affect who won. Rather than rerack and get the The Z06 hit 60 in 3.1 seconds, The Vette ran 10.8 with the Mustang a Even though the GT500 handily the Corvette maintained and hit the gas hard The Chevy finished the with the Shelby a But yet again, the Mustang at 147.9. But as we know, you speed to win at U-Drags. And as you can see, didn't change the result. And now let's turn to our leaderboard.
