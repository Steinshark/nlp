It wears on you after a while. BARACK OBAMA: International advise, and assist the alongside them when needed. But we will shift into Afghans step forward. But we must finish the job we this war responsibly. EDDY MORETTI: This is what the and the American government. But you don't believe you've seen to the contrary. BEN ANDERSON: Yeah, and the on the ground don't I mean, all it is now is about And we're not leaving because We're leaving because achieving those goals. That's the only goal now good as we pull out. It could even be worse than that has been to introduce a corrupt, government, who in some areas like the good guys. And when you remember that the power in the mid '90s because just Muslims in comparison to similar today. -I'll go ahead and give you guys and cleanliness of the PB. The big thing is separating eat, use the restroom. You want to keep it separate. So if you're eating, or you using the restroom, you pretty bacteria you just got rid of and skin, using your hands to eat. It's just going right back in cause sickness, diseases. -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -Let me explain one We're taking time out of our OK, everybody here is taking down here, away from our -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -We're not here to If we say something that apologize ahead of time. Let us know, and we'll fix it. BEN ANDERSON: Everyone believes accelerated now as we leave. The training is almost Most of the forces are pulled they never leave. Because, as I say, the people given up on there being -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] BEN ANDERSON: So they've got stuffed in the furthest room sandbags who they were trying -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -They are so hungry. -How long have they -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -OK. -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -Oh. There's four guys. -Four? -Yeah. -Tell them I was going to the heard voices back in the -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -Can we see if they're in our Can we do the eye scan? -These guys? -Yeah.

[FOREIGN LANGUAGE]? -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -Can we give them water? -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]? -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -Just wait? -Right. EDDY MORETTI: Doesn't the US resources to do-- this is the psyche up. BEN ANDERSON: Well, the idea's into a town, clear Then all these other people come in governance and build That other bit rarely ever happen anywhere near as much So it's left to guys like him, fight, not to do all these very complicated, difficult jobs. And later that day, a local He was the man behind the -Was the purpose of the whole night, just to go get and get those Taliban? Or was there another mission, these guys? -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -If he-- he can only That's what that warrant was kidnapped his brother. Kidnapping their brothers is any random person. It's kidnapping. It's a crime. It's not legal to kidnap Only if they're Taliban, Other than being the brothers his brother, they haven't They haven't committed So they cannot be arrested if wrong themselves. Just because they're the not mean that they are -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] BEN ANDERSON: This shows They don't really know. All they know is four guys have are being illegally detained, And it's being hidden They're playing catch-up That's all they can do. The Marines I was with turned up patrol base. But the Afghan police had pulled down and were selling at the local bazaar. So they had no security So the Marines couldn't stay. -Looks like they just took So they were still here, they are right now. You've got to find out where where you want to try to make make them into American That's not the intent But we also want to teach them it, that if you do have a you still have to BEN ANDERSON: So while the they snuck them into the back out the gate. [CAR HORN] BEN ANDERSON: It's sort of a to make them stop because they to make them stop. -I got a good look Two of them had their So we can still look at who they might be. -Hey, if you don't have your BEN ANDERSON: So after the truck detainees in the back, three bases came under attack [GUNFIRE] -South-southeast. -How far? -At least 300 meters. BEN ANDERSON: As soon as the truck somewhere, they They only attack Although some bullets eventually watch tower that we were in. [GUNFIRE] -Hey, what are they -Talk to them, Dunlap. -There's a truck coming in. -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -Don't shoot until -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] TRANSLATOR: -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -He says they're outside the If I do shoot, they -Wait 'til they come out. -Well, if you don't see them, the bullets. You're going to waste ammo. -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -Kids right at the tree line. -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -You got any eyes over -Negative. -We've got nothing. -Here. -Where, sir? -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] BEN ANDERSON: He was so angry He just grabbed the big machine and then just fired wildly. [GUNFIRE] -He's just walking He's not aiming at anything. -They ran to the corner? -Yeah, they're just walking down nothing. -What's that? -They're just walking down the [GUNFIRE] -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -Not if we don't have it. -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] TRANSLATOR: If we run out of rocks to fight the Taliban. -All right. Good to go. BEN ANDERSON: This is another advising the police. And on the police base, there's like right next to their little EDDY MORETTI: Did you see-- BEN ANDERSON: Inside EDDY MORETTI: Did you BEN ANDERSON: Everywhere. Every police base has -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -Well, you have two options. You can go to PHQ, and you can TRANSLATOR: -Or you're going to have with what you have. But I recommend you go to PHQ And show them that weapon and weapons to replace that. EDDY MORETTI: They don't actually, there has been We are supposed to They're still expecting the US BEN ANDERSON: And that's what through to the Afghans yet. One Afghan soldier said to me, Americans leave because all the and equipment, we'll And I was saying-- EDDY MORETTI: It doesn't BEN ANDERSON: No, no, no. And also, someone, somewhere, when we supported the Mujahideen Russians, and remember we left And we had to spend years and those weapons, particularly the We're not making that So these guys have got AK-47s, trucks, a few Humvees, which Americans or British And that's all they've got. -Well, then, here's the thing. We're trying to get you to the without heavily depending But nothing is going to happen show us a plan. -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -I hear great things You're a good PB commander, a lot of men here. And I think you're going -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] BEN ANDERSON: And he eventually that you have to come up Then you can do it, and we'll So they leave with the police come up with a plan within a And a few days later, he just one's heard from him since. No plan. EDDY MORETTI: No plan. -Put your helmet on, Sayid. Sayid, put your Kevlar BEN ANDERSON: At another patrol didn't seem to want the Marines' -You can just have your guys -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -All right. Well, based on the sandbags that's all we got. So let's go ahead and Once we have filled those up, will fill it up with sandbags. The other five is going the other one fixed. And then we'll switch. Hey, if you guys don't want to understand it. But we're here to help If you guys don't we'll leave the sandbags. You guys figure it out. We're taking our gear with us. We're here to help you guys out, That way, you guys don't get All right? -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] Anywhere here? Huh? You're going to check? -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -Yes or no. [FOREIGN LANGUAGE]? Move out of the way. -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [MINE SWEEPER TONES] BEN ANDERSON: Policeman at the which is kind of normal. But two of the policemen filling of their brains on something opium or heroin, literally or sit down, filling So while all that was happening, shots at the watchtower filling sandbags for. [GUNSHOT] -Was that him? -[INAUDIBLE], what's going on? -What's he shooting at? [GUNSHOT] -What are you shooting at? What the fuck is that? -Maybe he's shooting They don't have positive ID. -What are you shooting at? What are you shooting -The PB commander -Where? ---just a show of force, -Huh? You see Taliban? Where do you see Talis? Yeah, where? -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] TRANSLATOR: Taliban stay [INAUDIBLE] shoot past. -They're in the garden, and -Yeah. -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -Pull the [INAUDIBLE]. BEN ANDERSON: They haven't seen They just want to get some shots show of force. -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -What's that? They're in the garden? -In the garden. -You've got to make -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -You've got to make sure you firing rounds down there, you were firing at. You've got to see them -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -But just like I'm saying, just see somebody before you fire lies on beyond that. -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -Professionals don't do that. Professionals make sure they lies beyond their target. Professionals don't just You're supposed to You guys are professionals. That's why you don't do that. -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] BEN ANDERSON: And then three commander got shot right and scraped his lungs. And the Marine medic saved him, heroin in his pocket. So I'm sure these guys [BICYCLE HORN SQUEAKING] -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -Are you putting your men You going to help them TRANSLATOR: -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] BEN ANDERSON: The lesson of the The police got bored of that car at their checkpoint, and then some kids to fill and carry -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] BEN ANDERSON: This is He's in charge of the Police go out to all these bases. He spends most of his time at trying to advise But the actual police chief job, went on hajj, hadn't been a half months. The acting police chief has And he's got no idea where he's BEN ANDERSON: And basically, often take all of their So the last time this happened, force in Sangin just vanished. So every time the US Marines they have to have a So one of them has got his rifle the trigger, ready in case BILL STEUBER: You ever see the It's vast. Everything from skimming supplies to skimming fuel There's false imprisonment. They'll take people. During an engagement, they'll was around it, and then they'll to come in and pay them money All of these vehicles are expenditures. So they're getting fuel and vehicle that you see, obviously, they can't run. They can't operate. They only got a handful of So in the district, I think maybe only 10 or 11 of But they're collecting the fuel all of the other vehicles, actually operate them. Ammunition's the same thing. We count the rounds when they And it's usually the rounds, sold in the bazaar. That'll happen in transit, get it here and we take watchful as to what's going This was taken up off What's interesting is the guy when he came in, he was these trucks like this. And we went up to bring them a let us cover him. It was kind of disturbing. There was just a kid Pissed and shit himself bleeding all over and-- yeah, it sucks. It sucks to see kids BEN ANDERSON: Did they say why proper burial? BILL STEUBER: They said And we brought the sheet for whether he's a warrior-- he's still a warrior, you treated like one, But they didn't seem So that was the first EDDY MORETTI: What's amazing this, this soldier. BEN ANDERSON: He's one He was more sort of emotionally than anybody else. And he's the one who I said traumatized by what I was kind of foist upon him, let me go out filming But he's one of those guys I could ask him questions, and with a good way of saying it. But he just couldn't And I really admired BILL STEUBER: As an advisor, bark and not a lot of bite. So there's some things that in accomplished-- I'm not going to say-- blind eye to anything. We report everything. But there's certain things that just be like, hey, this We're not going to do this. That you, in order to get the for them to actually go out and hold PVs, you've kind Things like if we were go in schemes, all of their corruption render them completely You take a look around-- BEN ANDERSON: Really, really end of this, because even when young boys and murdering them, of his reports. He was reporting everything he the chain of command. Nothing was ever done. BILL STEUBER: You've got guys That's one officer, the investigating officer, who They're academy trained They can read. They can write. They believe in the They believe in securing the treating them right. I mean, these are the guys that But then you have over here a kidnapping boys and them, robbing the people. He treats the people of Sangin just shake and rob. And that's really difficult. How do you work with The natural part of an advisor effect on things. So it's easy to go work with the like this. But really, where we need with guys like that. So try doing that day in and molesters, working with people murdering them. It wears on you after a while. HAMID KHAN: BEN ANDERSON: So that's an Afghan Army commander. And he was the one note And the US Marines said he's the they've ever seen. Really good guy, really to the right questions. EDDY MORETTI: Not stoned? BEN ANDERSON: Not stoned. I think if he saw his-- well, soldiers that were stoned. But I think if he saw his men would stop it. HAMID KHAN: BEN ANDERSON: There are issues with the army. They're still completely ethnic groups. There are very few southern Army are southern Pashtuns. So a lot of southern Pashtuns as being almost as foreign Back in 2001, 2002, we could national army. But it's an exaggeration to It's not a national army. It's the Northern Alliance. It's the historical enemies -[CHANTING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] BEN ANDERSON: One thing you do got pictures of Massoud EDDY MORETTI: Right, who the Northern Alliance. BEN ANDERSON: Yeah. EDDY MORETTI: But he was like the other ones. BEN ANDERSON: Well, you talk to will say, listen, you in But when they shelled Kabul, were killed. And entering into these pictures of Massoud everywhere around New York with a picture window of my car. That's an exaggeration, but you who have come to protect and pictures of Massoud and pictures probably the most brutal warlord recent history. HAMID KHAN: BEN ANDERSON: There was a big Pashtuns to join the national It failed. And so they created They're called the Afghan Every village has got its They're tough guys who protect Some are Taliban. Some are anti-Taliban. And we just said to all of history, if we put you on the or not fight against us? And that's what these They're the Afghan -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] BEN ANDERSON: And some of the 16 years old. So as soon as we start Taliban-controlled village, [GUNFIRE] BEN ANDERSON: And straightaway not having any idea where They're firing towards the -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [GUNFIRE] BEN ANDERSON: So the ANA are They wanted to clear the first controlled by the Taliban. It's incredible to think that two miles of the main base in first arrived over six years ago the Taliban. But they're hoping to clear And there's a village on the is also Taliban-controlled. But they're hoping to collect them to join Afghan security and reject the Taliban and let permanent presence here. At the minute, they're firing to be shooting at anything. -Sniper. [GUNFIRE] BEN ANDERSON: That guy who's a fit, three days later fled rockets, planning to EDDY MORETTI: Why? BEN ANDERSON: He defected EDDY MORETTI: Holy shit. BEN ANDERSON: Insider attacks have got lots of headlines. It's far worse, insider Afghans, far worse. And he had three people working either lost their courage But they were still within that knows who they were. [GUNFIRE] BEN ANDERSON: So there's a everything. They've got them all EDDY MORETTI: Whose BEN ANDERSON: American. And they've got these cameras thermal, which means you can EDDY MORETTI: Kind of like They just sort of sit there. BEN ANDERSON: Yeah, exactly, But they can stay up there in attached by one cable. So someone is watching And he says, it's four guys, But as they were running away, planted a white flag in the And that's not a flag That's the Taliban's EDDY MORETTI: Oh shit. BEN ANDERSON: And planted that, HAMID KHAN: -Fuck! -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] EDDY MORETTI: Why is he BEN ANDERSON: He's an Afghan local police. But he hasn't signed up and getting paid. So he collects all the casings local bazaar. So the Marines accompanying advising at all. They let the ANA plan and themselves. And they're just here just in and lots of people are But apart from that, this Afghan-led. And I've never seen I've seen lots of operations Afghan-led. But it's a farcical claim. This really is an Afghan-led Good, good. [FOREIGN LANGUAGE]. -[FOREIGN LANGUAGE], -Finish. -No go Tali. -Run away. -Fuck you, Taliban. BEN ANDERSON: So at the end of to the village where they remaining local elders together need to give us some men, give own local police force, and HAMID KHAN: -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] HAMID KHAN: -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] HAMID KHAN: -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] HAMID KHAN: -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] BEN ANDERSON: That was pretty all of this money and effort saying to villagers like these weapon, and you can So we're asking Afghans to pick Afghan government right as we're Taliban are as strong as ever. And if I was an Afghan living EDDY MORETTI: It's like, hey, BEN ANDERSON: Yeah, or-- I wouldn't pick any side. I'd be nice to whichever that point. Then, in the middle of all this, the American ambassador and the I was told it was a Because Sangin has always been town in Afghanistan. So the American and deputy show if they can visit this progress must be being made. They walked about 150 meters, where they were given nothing wonderfully everything -So you're saying they're not They're starting to move out. -Yes, sir. A little bit earlier, here of the operations that have about to be, sir. We ripped out with 1-7 about a reduced a lot of the Marine northern Helmand, and we've seen those patrol bases throughout -The numbers may show that in the attacks. The effectiveness is far People are talking about the And I showed a map of 2010 where Sangin Valley is blocked red. And now, we talk about it entire district. And that's a good thing. So there's not that sustained seen in the past. So again, it's a continuing road And it's starting to expand. Working together, it's across want Sangin to be right now. -Yes, sir. The advisor teams are really BEN ANDERSON: The ambassadors that shows that Sangin, the Afghanistan, is now EDDY MORETTI: They're BEN ANDERSON: Yeah. It felt like they were there for few boxes and then leave. I mean, the Marine major who was all the problems he's having-- abuse, child rape-- he was there and had to sit say a word. Wasn't asked a single EDDY MORETTI: That's a him a question. BEN ANDERSON: Well, I guess present a very rosy picture. If they turned up, and they hear murder, drug-- kidnapping all going on, stunt has failed miserably. [MUSIC PLAYING] [LAUGHTER] -The government is -Thank you. Thank you. NIC HAILEY: Thank Thank you. We're very committed to -Hopefully [INAUDIBLE] Helmand and Kabul. -This is a small gift BEN ANDERSON: So this is a involve the enemy. Only involves one side. And nothing was announced I mean, the idea of a jirga is come together, thrash it out, JAMES CUNNINGHAM: I am here chairman of the High Peace He's attending a peace important event in Sangin. And I've been wanting to come This is my first visit to impressed by what I've JAMES CUNNINGHAM: I don't know that the country would be We've always understood, I end an insurgency, this means, especially since the in Pakistan. So the prospect or the job is Taliban, but to create a way and Afghanistan is secured. The Afghan security forces are over 75% of the population now continue until they are in the We have developed now a way to Afghans responsible increasingly future and for their and their own processes. And that is as it should be. I think post-2014, we can't The door is open, as I said process that will bring Taliban if they choose to And for our part, we intend partnership with the Afghans NIC HAILEY: We're here today here in Sangin, which is a of the most important tribal to talk about peace and I think peace involves people And I think it's about the about what label they If the Taliban choose that they politics in Afghanistan, if violence, if they choose to choosing of people's leaders, those choices can be part If they don't make those themselves up against the Afghan be part of the process. I think it's as simple BEN ANDERSON: A few years ago, the Taliban are finished in again control the lives NIC HAILEY: I think we've always that people who want to take country who respect the rights of people, have a right this country, just as in BEN ANDERSON: I think I can say that if you asked a lot of bad guys in this area, they than the Taliban. How can you change that amount of time? NIC HAILEY: I'm not that perception, Ben. I think, again, talking to the out on patrol with those that the attitude of the Afghan Sangin has changed hugely BEN ANDERSON: And then at the helicopter out was delayed So I said to them, go and talk Just say, this won't But go and speak to him and really going on, just 200 They said, oh, he wouldn't be is with you. And they went and had a cup of instead, walked back on the But you literally walk 200 and you'll see that it's The exact opposite is true. So ISAF put out a statement diplomats visited the once saw first-hand the progress think was the point of going talk to guys like And certainly not to These guys are the elected And the British are very proud, council elected by 2,000 But I spent a whole day with a single good thing we've achieved there. -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] EDDY MORETTI: That's BEN ANDERSON: And if anyone intervention, it would elected local officials. -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] BEN ANDERSON: Before that Steuben knew that three young police patrol bases. All three of them were chai been abducted by the police servants-- they served tea-- They were raped by the And you see them You see several boys, sometimes sometimes not, but It's a very common Three of them had been shot possibly by another chai boy. Nobody's quite sure. And he's just found out that a point blank range in the leg And I was there, so he let me police chief and confront QHATTAB KHAN: BILL STEUBER: Yesterday, we had A young boy, about 13, maybe Now, there's a couple things on talked about. We've had all the PB commanders about having young boys QHATTAB KHAN: TRANSLATOR: I have mentioned BILL STEUBER: I know. I know. Why was there a boy Why-- what did that commander QHATTAB KHAN: BEN ANDERSON: He's saying the Which begs the question, be trying to escape? And in one case, one of them so that he could escape. And that's what led BILL STEUBER: We cannot We can't have children even But this one was yesterday. It's against the law. QHATTAB KHAN: BEN ANDERSON: So this meeting half, two hours. And as you can see, he's not practice and doesn't really seem wrong with this practice. BILL STEUBER: Let's do this. Let's get together and go out of these PBs and get them We'll go in there early We'll start going from And if they've got kids in there we know that they've probably We'll free the kids, and we'll BEN ANDERSON: Eventually, maybe he says, OK, I agree. We'll go out. We'll do a raid first thing I'm going to arrest these keeping chai boys. So Major Steuber thought he had QHATTAB KHAN: BILL STEUBER: I have things that You and I are in a position situation in this city. QHATTAB KHAN: BILL STEUBER: If you do this, somebody who stands for QHATTAB KHAN: BILL STEUBER: Let's do this. OK? I'm serious. QHATTAB KHAN: BEN ANDERSON: So Major Steuber thinking this operation was were going to turn up there arrest these guys. A few hours later, he got Can't do it. Operation's canceled. And to this day, no operation question the police EDDY MORETTI: How rampant BEN ANDERSON: Well, one of his than he does, said to me, try doesn't fuck young boys. Most of the patrol bases the so hard to establish have been the Afghans. Major Steuber, he's bolstered chief has returned, a guy And eight days into his job as just gone on hajj unannounced for 2 and 1/2 months. He's been accused of keeping accused of corruption but said And Major Steuber really difference. BILL STEUBER: There's been since you've left that are the police and the community. The biggest one going on site three children, young BILL STEUBER: There was one There was another boy killed [INAUDIBLE]. And we just had a 13-year-old [INAUDIBLE]. And there's a fourth unconfirmed who serves tea. Up at [INAUDIBLE], there was a boy that they were fighting was shot in the face GHULI KHAN: BILL STEUBER: We definitely because you can do 100 good policeman go and do something all they focus on is So I know that's an And I know that's nothing that in your PBs. But that's what's here in your absence. TRANSLATOR: GHULI KHAN: BILL STEUBER: I also say that, that's very good. These are all the patrolmen BEN ANDERSON: This really gave He was sending 20 men off to capital, to get proper They were going to come back GHULI KHAN: BEN ANDERSON: The day after they police training, six of them failed the drugs test. So that was a Marine sweeping EDDY MORETTI: Behind BEN ANDERSON: Yeah. Which sums up the situation This was an operation to find an had got intelligence about. It turned out to be a derelict rocket hidden in the corner, And then Ghuli Khan arrived to the local elders. His message was pretty GHULI KHAN: -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] GHULI KHAN: -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] GHULI KHAN: -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] GHULI KHAN: -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] GHULI KHAN: -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] GHULI KHAN: -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] GHULI KHAN: -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] GHULI KHAN: -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] GHULI KHAN: -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] GHULI KHAN: -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] GHULI KHAN: -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] GHULI KHAN: EDDY MORETTI: It's kind of I mean, aren't these people years of this shit? BEN ANDERSON: But that's going to pick sides. That's why they're just going to life by being nice to whoever's day to day. And at the minute, these guys, leaving very soon. The Taliban aren't So the idea they're going to their own is ridiculous. GHULI KHAN: -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] GHULI KHAN: -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] GHULI KHAN: -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] GHULI KHAN: -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] GHULI KHAN: -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] GHULI KHAN: -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] GHULI KHAN: BEN ANDERSON: He's saying that that's been created, this created, you're on your own. And you need to not work, not here and stop the Taliban from from your homes. GHULI KHAN: BEN ANDERSON: Supposedly, the to protect these people from the a wedge between the people And he's saying, defend GHULI KHAN: -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] GHULI KHAN: EDDY MORETTI: Do you think any well, sitting there? BEN ANDERSON: Yeah. It wouldn't surprise Taliban aren't this outside, that have come in. Most of the Taliban fight, distance of their homes. There's always some Taliban GHULI KHAN: -That's all you get. BEN ANDERSON: This was the third that I followed. And it was very tense because earlier who fled with EDDY MORETTI: Yeah, the guy that BEN ANDERSON: Yeah. One of Hamid Khan's men was loads of weapons and a And he was planning to kill a He had three accomplices And no one knew if they were EDDY MORETTI: Double BEN ANDERSON: This day, everyone than normal, watching So everyone's on the lookout. -If you think that he's starting back because we're here, Because I don't want him to hold we're here. [GUNFIRE] -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] HAMID KHAN: -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] HAMID KHAN: -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] BEN ANDERSON: In this operation, local informers who they've put balaclavas on, actually gave And they're sweeping through a out who they say are Taliban. And those guys get arrested. HAMID KHAN: -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] HAMID KHAN: -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] HAMID KHAN: -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] HAMID KHAN: -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] EDDY MORETTI: Is that a common BEN ANDERSON: Yeah, fairly. But the problem with that is their local rivals, rather The other problem with that is Taliban, most of the people who get released because of money connections. The informer said this Taliban general governor. GHULI KHAN: [RADIO CHATTER] GHULI KHAN: BEN ANDERSON: What often happens Lashkar Gah, the capital, but out for lack of evidence, EDDY MORETTI: There BEN ANDERSON: There It was claimed to me-- know how true it is. It was claimed to me that the single successful case -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] BEN ANDERSON: So we've now got footsteps of the man in front first band of IEDs that Afghan to get to the village that It's a road covered in easy to hide IEDs. -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [MINE SWEEPER SQUEALING] -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [EXPLOSION] -Fucker! -Ah, no problem, yeah. [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [MIND SWEEPER SQUEALING] -OK. BEN ANDERSON: The focus of the this white flag, the flag not a flag of surrender. And it's within view of one So all they wanted to do was And they had a few funny ideas -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -You should. -The flag needs to come down. I agree. HAMID KHAN: -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] HAMID KHAN: -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] HAMID KHAN: BEN ANDERSON: So I think they hour, which is unbelievably GHULI KHAN: BEN ANDERSON: So meanwhile, back Steuber is still wrestling same terrible problems. BILL STEUBER: We've built We've got four towers, and we've we've got a pump and gates But-- [ECHOING] BILL STEUBER: --it's empty. There's no fuel here. And because of that, because need, they can't get out. They've got 34 patrol bases southern Green Zone all the way that they can't get out to. If there's anything that's out jeopardize the security here, fighting well. It's going to be something Not having any fuel to be Where the fuel comes into generally a two-hour And the southern part of the known as the page controlled by the Taliban. So you can't get a fuel It's just too dangerous for them to try and come up here and their vehicles. So what they have to do is they down there in Lashkar Gah. And they sell the fuel, and fuel or selling those types of corruption to be able to And unfortunately, this about 20,000 liters And the spigot has literally BILL STEUBER: I don't It's nearly $1 million So whatever US $1 million BEN ANDERSON: The government the police are stealing so much going to give it to them. So they can't move. They can't go anywhere. There was a big fight the couldn't get to it, because And the thing is, they just bail them out and give them Marines are now saying, it's not You are on your own now. EDDY MORETTI: Right. So they've been stealing it for the Americans, and now the BEN ANDERSON: Yeah. BILL STEUBER: We had a long Matine today about how somebody commission within the AUP. He said it costs about 50,000 $1,000 to be able to get the And then it's another US $4,000 within MOI in Kabul, be able to So in order to become an lieutenant here, costs $5,000. So that's quite a steep BILL STEUBER: No. No, not by that timeline. These are serious logistical And the difference being that people that are working And this is a very This right here, this generator complex piece of machinery. They don't have the technical this and run it. They don't have the systems or able to get fuel through a to fill up this tank. I only have basically five them how to do this stuff. And then the next team's going going to spend a month trying learn with the AO for And then they're going to have bus, so to speak. And they still have process and how it goes. So our actual amount of time to be able to one, understand to coach them through it and the supplies and be able to have section, it's a complicated And makes it even more police force whose officers They can't communicate I mean, if everything's phone, there's no tracking. There's no record keeping. The system becomes wide open for You look on the roof of the You can see the solar panels But when you go up there, and you see that they're not really And when you ask them, well, Who put this in here? They can't answer They don't know how it works. And I've got policemen I've got an administrative But I don't have any solar panel help them fix that out. So it's left to guys like myself figure out how to hook up solar an electrical structure BEN ANDERSON: The whole policy educated, literate, there was a for years, as if the Taliban if everybody wanted little And it's all a fantasy for 10, None of the things that need anywhere near in place. BILL STEUBER: That antenna right by it, I think, if that's not a to do here, I don't I mean, it's a functioning It's standing on its own. It's twisted and bent and But it's there, and it works. And hopefully it'll still BEN ANDERSON: Pretty much every blow to Major Steuber. Something really bad happened In this case, there was a deputy was sure had tortured detainees himself that everyone thought politely fired. Suddenly, he appeared BILL STEUBER: Any time you figured out, something else'll you weren't expecting. I had been assured by the DG. I had been assured by people was going to be gone, and I about him, that he was going against the people But he's still here. Although he looks a little bit days ago, he's still here. And I don't know what I'm But he is away. He's out of the driver's Ghuli Khan's back. And that gives me hope. Because if you have people even though he's had He's no saint by any means. You saw today, he's working And the guy that's sitting right there, right now, that was telling the [INAUDIBLE] that-- him and the CID officer were you if you come over here. I'm going to kill you if you BILL STEUBER: I don't know. I don't know. I mean, the case on that guy you ask me. But apparently, somebody BEN ANDERSON: So Ghuli Khan sense of cautious optimism. A few weeks after I for no apparent reason. He was replaced by an illiterate Marines were told had paid the government in Kabul. I came in a few nights after they sit down and have coffee. And he was just laying on his I thought he was asleep. He had got a call, and four kids old Chinese rocket, I think, And it had gone off. And-- EDDY MORETTI: They all died. BEN ANDERSON: Yeah, And again, it wasn't I didn't read about But he had had to go and EDDY MORETTI: How many Marines Major Steuber that are that know the truth? BEN ANDERSON: That's a big thing about is you've got hundreds of hearing these statements, and I'm sure are coming back to problems and seriously At least four guys I've met in suicide since they got back. I really expected to have some I was with. Not one so far has said, pessimistic. They've all said, yeah, we all That's all you hear now is it's 80%, 90% of the country is now security forces. Let's not talk about what those security forces are like. Let's not talk about The fact they're in coming home is success. Taliban attacks are up. Civilian casualties are up. Fatalities for the Afghan 310 a month is the latest If that's not civil war already, And you get the impression these last, either. I mean, certainly, when they're not going to last. I spoke to a few Afghan friends said, what do you think is going after we really leave? They said, half will The other half will A lot people are saying that want it to in Afghanistan. They're blaming on Oh, they always fight Oh, it's just tribal rivalries, I don't think that's I think there was a chance. We could've got it right. But we put the worst people the bombing campaign because And it's our fault that it [MUSIC PLAYING]
