[dramatic music] - [Narrator] Most of Veatch's testimony was devoted to tracing the Valachi explained to the Senate committee how the smooth working evolved from the warring street gangs and power struggles of the early 1900s. Valachi took the committee when Sicilian boss, Salvatore Maranzano, took control of the New York mafia. [dramatic music] Valachi told how Maranzano to an audience of 400 mobsters, that the gangs of New York into five families to control the boroughs of the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island. [dramatic music] Valachi told how Maranzano the absolute ruler, he would be the boss of all bosses and if anyone disagreed, Valachi then explained [tense music] and he revealed how had Maranzano executed. [dramatic music] Luciano then introduced a more democratic form of leadership. He eliminated the boss of all bosses and created The Commission, effectively a board of directors And this led to an era and prosperity. [dramatic music] Valachi then named the present leaders of the five New York families, Vito Genovese. Carlo Gambino, Giuseppe Magliocco, Joseph Bonanno, And Gaetano Lucchese. These are the men, Valachi who run a huge web of involving gambling, prostitution, loan sharking, narcotics, and the infiltration of the mafia into legitimate businesses. [dramatic music] - [Senator] And about how many soldiers would usually be under a boss? - Well, Vito Genovese has about 450, in and around that. - 450? could be even be 500. - [Narrator] Valachi of over 130 members of and identified members of all claiming to know 289 mafiosi, all was laid out for the committee on five huge family charts. - I think what Valachi did was explain what the FBI had and didn't know they had. Frequently people in the mob and in other areas of criminal activity know others by nicknames. They may know their faces but they don't know their actual names. To the extent that now law enforcement had their actual names, we probably learned But other than that, I think Valachi's testimony and it has been proven accurate over time. [tense music] - [Senator] For those that in the five families you have marked with stars up on these charts. - Yes. - [Senator] The others you know 'em by aliases and you didn't know their other name? - Right. - [Senator] And therefore you - Right. - [Senator] Except that you along with their aliases. - Right. - [Senator] Very well. - He was the one who exposed the names of the people, the levels of authority down to the soldiers. - [Narrator] But there were some critics skeptical of Valachi's testimonies, believing that as a foot soldier he wouldn't have been relating to Cosa Nostra's inner circle. [dramatic music] - I think it is a mistake as being a low level figure. They're not, they are serious [dramatic music] The only people above a soldier in the direct line of authority [dramatic music] So a soldier is a person by the very nature of [dramatic music] They're given mob secrets, they are told about what has occurred, they need to know who other because they're free to cross but no one who's in the mob, and so they tend to know a great deal. [dramatic music] - [Narrator] Valachi used his testimony to get back at Genovese. - [Senator] I think you just a moment to tell how much the boss like Genovese over the soldier members like you. - Senator, I happen to know Vito's power. He not only has the power in our family, he also controls the and the Lucchese family, - [Senator] In other that makes it- - [Senator] And he and does - Well, he passes them out and then they tell you, well, they tell you anything - He passes them out, you know - [Joe] That is for sure. [gun shot] [tense music] - [Narrator] Valachi's He confirmed Cosa Nostra was the mafia. He revealed the names of the He explained their structure, He exposed their bloody history. [dramatic music] Above all, Valachi's Testimony and led to a change in priorities. [dramatic music] By 1963, the FBI's New York office had increased the number of its agents specializing in organized The following year, the to record Teamster's in a series of exchanges He was jailed for eight years. For the FBI, electronic surveillance was the future of a cracking [tense music] - I remember as a young agent, as a young organized crime that all over the country, we did wiretaps of the that flourished and were We made thousands of arrests and broke up hundreds of in an effort to choke off the flow of one of their great sources of money, - [Narrator] Thanks to the FBI's campaign against to a new level. Critically, for Attorney it was just the beginning. - The disclosures of Joseph Valachi and of others with knowledge in various parts of the country, have helped to give us of how these operations work. [upbeat music] - Valachi is the first in bringing down and destroying, at least wounding the mafia in America. Without him, it might've because there were no defectors. Even though he was low ranking, he still knew enough to and to get the public really the threat of the mafia. [dramatic music] - As for Joe Valachi, he was returned to the relative comfort of the District of where he had been kept Robert Kennedy, ever shrewd, believed Valachi had a lot more to offer. - Bobby Kennedy realized So what he did was said, &quot;Why everything you can - Over 13 months, Valachi more than 300,000 words on notepads from his cell in Washington. He had been there from the very beginning of the modern mafia and it was a unique day by day portrayal over a 30 year period But for someone who had Valachi's memoir was no - It's unprintable, it's probably. [gentle music] - [Narrator] Kennedy - The Justice Department to sit down, use the memoir, and also discuss Valachi's life with him. - [Narrator] This was to form a book, which the Justice Department hoped would encourage other During this period, the department started making plans to reward Valachi for his cooperation, and were even thinking of sending him somewhere to relax in the sun. - Bobby Kennedy had some wild scheme that maybe he could find a girlfriend, or bringing Valachi's wife and put him on some desert island where he could live out That was impossible and he still had a sentence for murdering that fellow - [Narrator] But killing the stopping him going to a desert island. [tense music] The Italian American had got hold of Valachi's It printed a virulent editorial against the forthcoming book, saying it was perpetuating the kind of image of with the many Italian names This snowballed into a massive proclaiming it would slur Their campaign was successful. The White House stepped in Overnight, everything changed for Valachi. He was told the whole thing was off and was hauled out of his and transported back into the [suspense music] He was placed in a small where he was to spend in solitary confinement. Valachi despaired. [tense music] On the morning of April the 11th, 1966, he took the mains lead from his radio and stepped into a shower cubicle. The shower head was unable and he was found on the floor by a guard soon afterwards. The Justice Department realized their prize witness better. - They took him out of the They sent them to what they considered the best place for him, a place called La Tuna near and they gave him a suite and he had a better, more comfortable bed. They tried to make life as convenient and comfortable as possible. Whenever the Justice Department now gets a real topnotch defector, they send them to what it's [dramatic music] - [Narrator] In 1968, and five years after he had given away the Mafia's secrets to the world, Valachi's finally got to read [dramatic music] It was called &quot;The Valachi Papers,&quot; and it became a bestseller. Valachi never received a penny from it. The book was turned into Valachi was played by Charles Bronson. The real Joe Valachi died at La Tuna Federal Correctional [tense music] He outlived his mafia boss, The $100,000 bounty by Genovese was never collected. [gentle music]
