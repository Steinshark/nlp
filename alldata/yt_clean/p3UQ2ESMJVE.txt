And we were listening-- was celebration happening. But we didn't realize that were gathering in front at that time to celebrate. And my staff was calling me. Everybody was celebrating. And people were crying. And I thought, I Also, we had worked to make sure in the LGBT colors. So the lighthouse-- It was so beautiful. It was beautiful. So we had made that plan. And I was sitting and watching I'm living this. I said, I have to I want to go outside, a part of that celebration. So I had the bright idea. I'm going outside. So I tried to find So I went to Barack's we should go outside. And he was like, babe, I've I can't go out. And he was like, you know Come on. Get out of my office. I go to Malia. I said, do you want-- I go to Sasha. I said, you want to and see the house, its colors? Let's celebrate. And she's like, no, I'm I went to Malia's room, Go with me. And she says, OK. I'm down. So it's me and Malia, to get out of the White House. And realize that it's not that House when you're in it. But we were determined.
