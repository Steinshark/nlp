&gt;&gt; RIGHT ON CUE, THIS CROWD ON ITS FEET FOR THE LAST 15 MINUTES, CHEERING THEIR BELOVED COLTS. THAT'S IKE TAYLOR. HE WILL TAKE THE RETURN DUTIES TODAY, AS QUINCY MORGAN FRACTURED A LEG IN LAST WEEK'S VICTORY AGAINST CINCINNATI. TAYLOR, A RAJIN' CAJUN FROM LOUISIANA-LAFAYETTE WAITS, AND THAT SPINNER COMES DOWN AT THE 1. TAYLOR, THE CORNERBACK, FAKES THE REVERSE, AND HE'S HIT AT THE 16-YARD LINE. WHAT A TACKLE. DARRELL REID, WHO'S BECOME THE WEDGE BREAKER FOR THE COLTS. ROETHLISBERGER HIT, THROWS, AND INCOMPLETE, THROUGH THE HANDS OF ANTWAAN RANDLE EL. FREENEY COMES OUT. HE MADE HIS PRESENCE FELT ON THE INITIAL PLAY. [ CROWD CHEERS ] THAT'S HARPER PLAYING ON THE LEFT CORNER. HAND-OFF INSIDE. NO, THE FAKE AND A LONG THROW IS COMPLETE TO HEATH MILLER. AND THE TIGHT END IS IN TO INDIANAPOLIS TERRITORY AT THE 47-YARD LINE. BEAUTIFUL THROW, DAN. &gt;&gt; WELL, THE STEELERS TOLD US THAT THEY WERE GONNA PUT THIS GAME MORE INTO THE HANDS OF BEN ROETHLISBERGER, AND, AS YOU CAN SEE, PASSES ON THE VERY FIRST TWO PLAYS OF THE GAME. AND THERE'S A LITTLE BIT FOR THE COLTS -- BURNED BY PLAY-ACTION. NO OFFENSE THROWS MORE PLAY-ACTION IN THIS LEAGUE THAN THE COLTS OFFENSE. AND NOW IT'S THE STEELERS' TURN, AND YOU SEE MIKE DOSS GETS CAUGHT WAY UP INSIDE, AND THE ROOKIE BURNS HIM. &gt;&gt; MILLER, THE NUMBER-ONE DRAFT PICK OUT OF VIRGINIA, WHO CAUGHT 39 PASSES ON THE SEASON. AND THEY LOVE HIS BLOCKING. PARKER'S FIRST CARRY. KNIFES HIS WAY TO THE 45-YARD LINE, AND RAHEEM BROCK AND COMPANY WITH THE TACKLE. COWHER IN HIS 14th SEASON, THE LONGEST-TENURED COACH IN THE LEAGUE. HIS ROAD RECORD IN PLAYOFF GAMES 1-3, BUT WE SHOULD POINT OUT IN THE LAST TWO SEASONS, THE STEELERS HAVE LOST ONLY 3 TIMES IN 17 GAMES ON THE ROAD. [ CROWD CHEERS ] UNDER THE DIN OF THE RCA DOME, SECOND AND 8. ROETHLISBERGER OVER THE MIDDLE. FINDS MILER AGAIN, AND THE TIGHT END IS INSIDE THE 30-YARD LINE! TWO BIG CATCHES BY MILLER, AND THE STEELERS HAVE MARCHED DEEP. &gt;&gt; AND AGAIN I THINK THAT THE STEELERS HAVE CAUGHT THE COLTS A LITTLE BIT OFF GUARD BY COMING OUT AND PUTTING THE BALL IN ROETHLISBERGER'S HANDS. WATCH BEN. HE BUYS HIMSELF A LITTLE EXTRA TIME. IT ALLOWS MILLER TO GET OPEN OVER THE MIDDLE. AND LOOK AT THAT HOLE IN THE COLTS' ZONE. NOW, THERE IS A SOFT SPOT IN THERE, BUT THAT WAS GAPING. &gt;&gt; MOBILITY OF ROETHLISBERGER SETTING UP THAT 18-YARD GAIN. BACK TO PARKER. HIT IN THE BACKFIELD AND BROUGHT DOWN BY DAVID THORNTON. THERE'S AN EXAMPLE OF HOW FAST THIS 11-MAN DEFENSE IS FOR THE INDIANAPOLIS COLTS. &gt;&gt; WELL, WILLIE PARKER DOESN'T HAVE MUCH OF A CHANCE WHEN THE TACKLES ARE BEING MADE IN THE BACKFIELD. WILLIE NEVER EVEN GETS BACK TO THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. HE TRIES TO CUT OUTSIDE. &gt;&gt; THORNTON, A DRUM MAJOR IN HIS HIGH SCHOOL BAND. BARELY MADE IT THROUGH THE RANKS AT NORTH CAROLINA. FINALLY STARTED AS A SENIOR. SECOND DOWN, 11. &quot;BIG BEN&quot; TO THE SIDELINE, COMPLETE. HINES WARD, THE OUTSTANDING AND CO-MOST VALUABLE PLAYER AGAIN THIS YEAR, ALONG WITH HIS NOSE TACKLE HAMPTON. AND HE'S SO RELIABLE. &gt;&gt; AND I THINK RIGHT OFF THE BAT WE'RE SEEING THIS AS A TOTALLY DIFFERENT BEN ROETHLISBERGER THAN WAS HERE ON THAT MONDAY-NIGHT GAME IN NOVEMBER. HE HAD MISSED THE PRIOR THREE WEEKS. HE HAD KNEE SURGERY. HE SAID, &quot;HEY, I TOOK IT WAY TOO EASY. I WAS AFRAID TO PUSH MYSELF.&quot; THIS IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT NUMBER 7 FOR PITTSBURGH TODAY. &gt;&gt; THIRD AND 6. THE STEELERS WERE NOT VERY GOOD ON THIRD DOWNS THIS YEAR -- NEXT TO LAST IN CONVERSIONS. THE BEARS WERE LAST. THIRD AND 6. THE THROW. COMPLETE, INSIDE THE 15 AND ANOTHER FIRST DOWN. ANTWAAN RANDLE EL, WHO PLAYED AT NEARBY INDIANA UNIVERSITY DOWN IN BLOOMINGTON, HAS HIS FIRST CATCH. &gt;&gt; AND AGAIN THE STEELERS EXPLOITING THE INTERMEDIATE HOLES IN THE ZONE HERE AGAINST THIS COLTS DEFENSE. WIDE RECEIVERS, TIGHT ENDS, THEY ARE ALL FINDING A LOT OF ROOM ABOUT 10, 15 YARDS DOWNFIELD. &gt;&gt; RON MEEKS, THE DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR -- THIS IS THE WAY THE COLTS PLAY FOOTBALL. THEY GIVE UP A LOT OF COMPLETIONS. BUT, BOY, THAT'S WAY TOO MUCH ROOM. &gt;&gt; STEELERS, A TEAM THAT RAN THE FOOTBALL MORE THAN ANYONE IN THE LEAGUE -- 59% -- BUT THEY'RE THROWING TODAY. ANOTHER PASS, THE SCREEN TO PARKER, AND HE'S DUMPED BY THORNTON AGAIN. SO, WHEN BILL COWHER RAISED AN EYEBROW WITH US YESTERDAY AND SAID, &quot;WE HAVE A DIFFERENT GAME PLAN THIS TIME.&quot; &gt;&gt; WELL, HE SAID, &quot;WE MAY HAVE TO&quot; -- WHAT A LOT OF TEAMS DO. THEY MAY HAVE TO THROW THE BALL TO RUN THE BALL. TWICE IN THE LAST THREE TRIPS LAST WEEK IN CINCINNATI, PITTSBURGH GOT IT DONE. &gt;&gt; SECOND DOWN AND 10. AND JEROME BETTIS MAKES HIS FIRST APPEARANCE, THE 13-YEAR VETERAN FROM NOTRE DAME, THE NUMBER-5 RUSHER ALL TIME. AND HE GETS THE CALL. BETTIS AT THE 10 AND DOWN TO THE 5-YARD LINE, AS THE BIG MAN GOT UP TO A FULL HEAD OF STEAM. &gt;&gt; AND BOB SANDERS, THE ALL-PRO FREE SAFETY, IS THE GUY THAT HAS TO COME UP, AND HE GOES LOW ON JEROME BETTIS. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. BETTIS AGAIN STILL SHOWING THE QUICK FEET, THE ABILITY TO BURST. HERE COMES SANDERS. YOU SEE AND HITS HIM RIGHT ON THE KNEES. BOB SANDERS, HE IS -- LAST YEAR TONY DUNGY CALLED HIM THE &quot;UNGUIDED MISSILE.&quot; WELL, HE GUIDED HIMSELF RIGHT TO HAWAII, A PRO BOWL SLOT, AND FIRST-TEAM ALL-PRO THIS YEAR. &gt;&gt; THIRD DOWN, A SHORT 3. ROETHLISBERGER OVER THE MIDDLE. TOUCHDOWN! AND WIDE OPEN WAS RANDLE EL. AND WHAT AN OPENING DRIVE BY THE PITTSBURGH STEELERS. ON THE ARM OF BIG BEN ROETHLISBERGER, PITTSBURGH MARCHES CONVINCINGLY FOR THE OPENING SCORE. &gt;&gt; WELL, BIG BEN WENT TO RANDLE EL THE FIRST PLAY OF THE GAME. WASN'T ABLE TO GET A COMPLETION. THERE HE IS, JUST OFF THE LEFT TACKLE, THE INSIDE OF THE THREE RECEIVERS. AND AGAIN LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THE OPENING IN THE COLTS SECONDARY. ROETHLISBERGER HAD HIS PICK. HE CHOSE RANDLE EL, AND THAT WAS AN EASY TOUCHDOWN AND A GOOD CATCH BY RANDLE EL ON A BALL THAT WAS A LITTLE BEHIND HIM. &gt;&gt; EXTRA-POINT TRY BY JEFF REED TO COMPLETE THIS 84-YARD OPENING DRIVE. 10 PLAYS, 7 POINTS. AND IT WAS ROETHLISBERGER 6-FOR-7. HARDLY KNOW HE WAS 23 THE WAY HE DIRECTED THAT OPENING DRIVE. HOW WELL-SCRIPTED THAT WAS -- ONLY ONE INCOMPLETE PASS, HIS FIRST, AND THE TOUCHDOWN TO RANDLE EL. BY THE WAY, HIS FIRST SCORING GRAB SINCE GAME 1 OF THE SEASON. JEFF REED HAS IT TEED UP, AND THE COLTS WILL GET THEIR CHANCE, AS DOMINIC RHODES IS DEEP, AT THE 1. AND RHODES SURROUNDED. JUST DOES GET TO THE 20-YARD LINE. PEYTON MANNING AND THE COLTS' HIGH-POWERED OFFENSE ON THE FIELD. THAT NO-HUDDLE OFFENSE WILL BE IN FULL GEAR TODAY. THE STRETCH PLAY TO EDGERRIN JAMES, AND JAMES BUMPED OUT OF BOUNDS AFTER A GAIN OF A COUPLE. SECOND DOWN AND 8. THAT CONTRAST SUDDENLY VERY QUIET, ALTHOUGH THERE ARE A FEW STEELER FANS HERE. FIRST PASS FROM MANNING. THROWING FOR HARRISON AND INCOMPLETE. SO, A THIRD AND LONG FOR MANNING. THE COLTS HAVE THE BEST SUCCESS ON THIRD DOWN OF ANY NFL TEAM, 49% SUCCESS. &gt;&gt; STEELERS, ONLY 2 DOWN LINEMEN. &gt;&gt; AND POLAMALU RIGHT OVER THE CENTER. MANNING. INCOMPLETE, NO FLAG. GOOD DEFENSE BY CHRIS HOPE, THE SAFETY MAN, ABLE TO REACH IN AND BAT IT AWAY. &gt;&gt; BOY, OUTSTANDING COVERAGE. YOU COULD SEE PEYTON MANNING HAD PLENTY OF TIME TO SET UP. HE HAD A GOOD VIEW DOWNFIELD. THREW A LASER, BUT CHRIS HOPE WAS JUST TOO CLOSE. THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A JAM ON MARVIN, BUT LOOK AT THAT. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? HOPE DID GET THERE A LITTLE EARLY. THAT WAS ONE OF THOSE THINGS. HE TIMED IT AND GOT AWAY WITH IT. DICK LeBEAU, THE 68-YEAR-OLD DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR OF THE STEELERS. &gt;&gt; AND THE PUNT BY HUNTER SMITH. ANTWAAN RANDLE EL, THE ONLY PLAYER WITH 2 PUNT-RETURN TOUCHDOWNS THIS YEAR. AND HE VAULTS AHEAD TO THE 44-YARD LINE. PLAY-ACTION. AND WIDE OPEN AGAIN. THIS TIME IT'S JERAME TUMAN, THE OTHER TIGHT END, AND HE HAS A FIRST DOWN AT THE 36-YARD LINE. IT SHOULDN'T BE A SURPRISE THAT ROETHLISBERGER HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL. &gt;&gt; WE JUST SAW A BEAUTIFUL PASS AGAIN BY ROETHLISBERGER. &gt;&gt; TO TUMAN. THAT WAS GOOD FOR 19 YARDS. AND UNABLE TO RUN AS JUNE, CATO JUNE, TACKLES WILLIE PARKER. WE SAID THERE WAS NO SURPRISE. ROETHLISBERGER, HE GETS HIS WAKE-UP CALL EARLY. LOOK AT HIS RECORD ON THE SEASON IN THE FIRST QUARTER, COMPARED TO THE REST OF THE GAME. &gt;&gt; WELL, THE BIG ONE THERE IN THE MIDDLE, THE 0 INTERCEPTIONS VERSUS 9 THE REST OF THE GAME. A LOT OF IT IS FOLLOWING THE SCRIPT. THERE'S A COMFORT ZONE THERE. BUT, AGAIN, LOOK AT THE WAY BEN HAS STARTED THIS GAME. THE ONLY INCOMPLETION SHOULD HAVE BEEN CAUGHT BY RANDLE EL. EVERY OTHER PASS HAS BEEN PERFECT. &gt;&gt; PARKER LOST A YARD ON FIRST DOWN. BACK TO THE AIR. PUMP FAKE AND HE'S HIT, AND THE BALL IS INTERCEPTED! FREENEY MADE THE HIT, AND THE COLTS GET THE FIRST TURNOVER! CATO JUNE THE MAN ON THE SPOT WITH THE INTERCEPTION. &gt;&gt; WELL, THAT'S CATO JUNE'S SIXTH INTERCEPTION. HE HAD 5 DURING THE REGULAR SEASON. BEN JUST STAYED IN THE POCKET WAY TOO LONG. YOU GOT TO GET RID OF IT BEFORE THAT. &gt;&gt; DWIGHT FREENEY, CONSIDERED UNDERSIZED BY MANY, ONLY 6'1&quot;, DEFENSIVE END. HE CALLS HIMSELF A &quot;WILDFLOWER IN A FIELD OF DAISIES.&quot; AND IT WAS NO POSY HIT HE PUT ON BEN ROETHLISBERGER THAT FORCED THAT BALL FREE, AND CATO JUNE WITH THE INTERCEPTION AT THE 35. FAKE TO EDGERRIN JAMES. MANNING STEPS UP AND THROWS. INCOMPLETE. OVER REGGIE WAYNE'S HEAD ON THE SIDELINES. &gt;&gt; WHAT A GREAT MOVE BY DWIGHT FREENEY. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. GOING AGAINST MARVEL SMITH. HE SEES THERE'S A BLOCKER UPFIELD. HE DOES HIS SPIN BACK TO THE INSIDE. ROETHLISBERGER -- NOW RIGHT THERE BEN LOOKS LIKE HE'S GETTING READY TO DELIVER THE BALL. HE CAN'T FIND ANYBODY. AND THEN DWIGHT FREENEY'S HUSTLE AND GOOD SPIN MOVE CAUSES THIS INTERCEPTION. AND CATO JUNE -- TALK ABOUT JUST STANDING IN THE PROPER PLACE. THAT BALL JUST FLOATED RIGHT TO HIM. [ CROWD CHEERS ] &gt;&gt; JAMES. TOUGH RUNNING INSIDE. GETS ABOUT 3. AARON SMITH THE TACKLER. &gt;&gt; AND RIGHT NOW THIS OFFENSE OF THE INDIANAPOLIS COLTS NEEDS TO DO THEIR DEFENSE A LITTLE FAVOR. YEAH, THEY JUST GOT THAT INTERCEPTION. BUT THEY NEED SOME FIRST DOWNS HERE, BOTH FOR THEIR OWN CONFIDENCE. AND LET THAT DEFENSE GATHER ITSELF A LITTLE BIT OVER THERE. TOM MOORE, THE OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR -- YOU KNOW THAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT PUTTING TOGETHER A STEADY DRIVE HERE. LET YOUR DEFENDERS CATCH THEIR BREATH. &gt;&gt; ANOTHER THIRD AND LONG FOR MANNING. LOOKING FOR HIS FIRST COMPLETION. BRINGS BRANDON STOKLEY IN MOTION. THROWS LONG DOWN THE MIDDLE. NO ONE THERE. SO, THREE-AND-OUT ON THE FIRST TWO POSSESSIONS FOR THE COLTS. &gt;&gt; WELL, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT AT THE TOP OF THE SHOW WAS &quot;BACK IN THE SADDLE.&quot; AND CLEARLY THE COLTS OFFENSE IS NOT BACK INTO THE SADDLE YET. WELL, MUCH ADO MADE ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEY HAVEN'T PLAYED A MEANINGFUL FOOTBALL GAME IN A MONTH, AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN SO FAR OFFENSIVELY BEARS THAT OUT. THEY'VE GOT SOME RUST, AND THEY HAVEN'T SHAKEN IT YET. &gt;&gt; HUNTER SMITH, NUMBER FIVE IN THE LEAGUE IN PUNTING AVERAGE, TO ANTWAAN RANDLE EL AT THE 9. GOOD TWISTING MOVE. OOH, JUST TRIPPED UP AS HE CROSSED THE 20-YARD LINE, BUT A FLAG IS DOWN DEEP IN STEELER TERRITORY. &gt;&gt; THIS IS, I BELIEVE, GONNA BE A PENALTY AGAINST THE COLTS. AND BILL COWHER, I WOULD ASSUME, WOULD LIKE THEM TO KICK IT AGAIN. &gt;&gt; ...KICKING TEAM WAS OUT OF BOUNDS ON HIS OWN. 5-YARD PENALTY FROM THE END OF THE RUN. FIRST DOWN, PITTSBURGH. &gt;&gt; YEAH, YOU DON'T GET THE CHOICE ON THAT ONE WHEN HE GOES OUT OF BOUNDS COVERING THE KICK. &gt;&gt; TOSS TO PARKER ON THE SWEEP. HAS A BLOCKER. AND TWISTED DOWN AS HE HITS THE 37 BY NICK HARPER. &gt;&gt; WHEN WILLIE PARKER MAKES THAT TURN UPFIELD, HE DOES IT FASTER THAN MOST GUYS IN THIS LEAGUE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 4.28 SPEED. AND EVERY TIME WILLIE PARKER TOUCHES THE FOOTBALL, HE IS A GUY THAT CAN TAKE IT ALL THE WAY TO THE END ZONE. HE HAS JUST GOT THAT -- HE IS THE ANTI-BUS. [ BOTH LAUGH ] &gt;&gt; HE'S THE MASERATI. SECOND AND 1. [ CROWD CHEERS ] INSIDE TO KREIDER, THE FULLBACK, WHO GETS A RARE CARRY. HAD ONLY 3 ALL SEASON. IT'S ENOUGH FOR A FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; WELL, HE JUST DIDN'T WANT TO STOP RUNNING. [ CHUCKLES ] WHEN YOU ONLY GET A COUPLE CARRIES, YOU WANT TO MAKE THE MOST OF IT. OKAY, THEY TACKLE YOU. GET BACK UP AND START RUNNING AGAIN. &gt;&gt; KREIDER, WHO PLAYED HIS COLLEGE BALL AT NEW HAMPSHIRE. HE WAS A BLOCKER FOR JERRY AZUMAH, IN UNIFORM WITH THE BEARS IN GAME 2 TODAY. &gt;&gt; THAT FOOTBALL FACTORY. &gt;&gt; YOUR FAVORITE. &gt;&gt; DON'T THROW THAT AT ME. &gt;&gt; [ LAUGHS ] SIX FIRST DOWNS TO ZERO TO START THE GAME. 111 YARDS, PITTSBURGH. 5 FOR INDY. NOTHING FOR PARKER THIS TIME, AS RAHEEM BROCK WAS THERE TO STONEWALL THE BALLCARRIER. &gt;&gt; WELL, DWIGHT FREENEY IS NOT THE ONLY GOOD DEFENSIVE LINEMAN THAT PLAYS FOR THE COLTS. YOU SEE RIGHT THERE -- DAVID THORNTON. A GOOD LOOK COMING UP THERE UNDERNEATH WAS MONTAE REAGOR. THERE IS LARRY TRIPPLETT, COREY SIMON, ROBERT MATHIS, BROCK. THIS TEAM IS AWASH IN QUALITY DEFENSIVE LINEMEN. [ CROWD CHEERS ] &gt;&gt; OTHER THAN THE ONE 9-YARD RUN BY PARKER, THE COLTS HAVE STUFFED THE RUNNING GAME BUT HAVE REALLY BEEN OPEN TO THE PASSING OF ROETHLISBERGER. WHO GETS THIS ONE WOBBLED AWAY AS HE WAS HIT. IT WAS ROBERT MATHIS, WHO LED THE COLTS IN SACKS THIS YEAR WITH 11 1/2 THAT GOT HIS ARM. &gt;&gt; WHAT A JOB BY MATHIS, DICK. HE GOES UPFIELD, IS BLOCKED, AND THEN HE FALLS IN SIDEWAYS, THROWING ANY PART OF HIS BODY HE CAN AT ROETHLISBERGER. AT THE BOTTOM OF YOUR SCREEN THERE, WATCH ROBERT MATHIS. ALL RIGHT, NOW. OKAY, JUST FALL ANY WAY. THAT'S JUST OUTSTANDING HUSTLE. AND LOOK WHAT HE DID. HE GOT IN THERE AND GOT JUST ENOUGH OF HIS RIGHT HAND ON BEN'S FOREARM TO CAUSE THAT INCOMPLETION. AND A LOT OF TIMES, THAT CAN RESULT IN AN I-N-T. &gt;&gt; THIRD AND 10. VERRON HAYNES IN THE BACKFIELD WITH ROETHLISBERGER. DOWN THE MIDDLE, HINES WARD, AND HE COULD GO ALL THE WAY NOW. HAD TO PICK UP HIS SPEED, AND SANDERS FINALLY GETS A PIECE OF THE FACE MASK AND GETS ROARED OUT OF BOUNDS AT THE 16. &gt;&gt; WELL, ACTUALLY, WARD JAMMED BOB SANDERS RIGHT IN THE FACE MASK, AND DID HE HOLD ONTO IT? YOU CAN STIFF-ARM A GUY, BUT YOU CAN'T GRAB IT. &gt;&gt; PERSONAL FOUL, FACE MASK, NUMBER 21, THE DEFENSE. HALF THE DISTANCE TO THE GOAL. AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; AND, AGAIN, LOOK AT THIS PERFECT PASS. JUST DROPPED RIGHT IN THERE. AND THEN IT'S A HIT BY HIS OWN MAN THAT INJURES NICK HARPER. MIKE DOSS, THE SAFETY, CAME IN. HINES WARD ALL OF A SUDDEN FOUND HIMSELF STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD ALL BY HIMSELF. HERE COMES MIKE DOSS FROM THE LEFT, AND HE MAKES CONTACT, AND, BOY, DOES HE COLLAPSE THE LEFT KNEE OF NICK HARPER. OH, BOY, THAT REALLY WAS A STRETCH. &gt;&gt; JEROME BETTIS IN. FIRST AND GOAL AT THE 8, AND BETTIS DIGS HIS WAY FOR A COUPLE. GARY BRACKETT, THE MIDDLE LINEBACKER, ONLY 5'10&quot;, 235 POUNDS IN THIS UNDERSIZED COLTS DEFENSE, BUILT ON SPEED, HITTING POWER, NOT SIZE, MADE THE TACKLE. BETTIS OUTWEIGHS HIM BY 30 OR MORE. &gt;&gt; AND RIGHT NOW PITTSBURGH ON THE VERGE OF JUST WRITING THE OPPOSITE OF THE SCRIPT THEY FOLLOWED IN LATE NOVEMBER, WHERE THEY FELL BEHIND EARLY AND HAD TO PLAY CATCHUP. THEY'RE TRYING TO FORCE THE COLTS RIGHT HERE INTO A BIG DEFICIT. &gt;&gt; SECOND AND GOAL. FAKE. ROETHLISBERGER THROWS. TOUCHDOWN! IT'S HEATH MILLER, THE ROOKIE TIGHT END, AND THE STEELERS HAVE SCORED AGAIN. &gt;&gt; AND I'LL TELL YOU THIS. THE NOISE LEVEL BEFORE THAT TOUCHDOWN PASS WAS MAYBE HALF OF WHAT IT WAS EARLIER. THAT'S HOW MUCH HAD ALREADY BEEN TAKEN OUT OF THE CROWD. THIS IS REALLY GONNA TAKE THE CROWD OUT OF THE GAME. AGAIN, A SOFT SPOT IN THE MIDDLE. WORKING AGAINST MARLIN JACKSON, WHEN JACKSON TURNS HIM LOOSE. THEY'RE PLAYING A ZONE IN THE END ZONE. MIKE DOSS DOES NOT GET OVER IN TIME, AND RIGHT NOW, TONY DUNGY HAS TO BE AGHAST AT WHAT'S HAPPENING TO HIS DEFENSE. ROETHLISBERGER AND THE PASSING GAME OF THE STEELERS IS SHREDDING IT. &gt;&gt; JEFF REED'S EXTRA POINT. AND THE PASSING GAME RACKING UP THE YARDS -- 72 YARDS IN 7 PLAYS. THE 7-YARD TOUCHDOWN TO MILLER GIVING THE STEELERS A 14-0 LEAD. LAST 6 PLAYOFF GAMES, 3 WINS. THE COLTS DOMINATING EARLY IN THE FIRST HALF BUT IN THE LOSSES OUTSCORED 45-3. REED REALLY PUMPS THIS ONE, AND RHODES WILL HAVE TO TAKE THE TOUCHBACK. &gt;&gt; 0-FOR-4. HMM. &gt;&gt; WHILE HIS OPPONENT, BEN ROETHLISBERGER, 147 YARDS PASSING, 0 FOR MANNING. AND DOWN HE GOES AT THE 11-YARD LINE. THE FIRST SACK GOES TO KIMO VON OELHOFFEN. VON OELHOFFEN INVOLVED OF COURSE IN THAT TRAGIC TACKLE OF CARSON PALMER LAST WEEK THAT SENT PALMER TO THE SURGERY ROOM. &gt;&gt; WELL, VON OELHOFFEN IS NUMBER 67. HE JUST GETS TO THE INSIDE OF TARIK GLENN, THE LEFT TACKLE. THE GUARD CAME OUT ON THE PLAY, AND THERE'S A HUGE SOFT SPOT INSIDE. AND GLENN JUST NOT ABLE TO DRIVE VON OELHOFFEN FAR ENOUGH AND AWAY FROM MANNING. &gt;&gt; THE VETERAN VON OELHOFFEN FROM MOLOKAI, HAWAII. DIDN'T HAVE A HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL TEAM. &gt;&gt; THAT NUMBER THERE -- 166 TO MINUS-3. THAT DEFIES DESCRIPTION. &gt;&gt; SECOND DOWN AND 18. ONE-HANDED CATCH BY HARRISON, AND HE TAKES IT OUT OF BOUNDS AT THE 36-YARD LINE. A BRILLIANT PLAY BY THE ALL-PRO RECEIVER. &gt;&gt; WELL, MARVIN HARRISON COMING ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE FIELD. HE STARTED ON THE RIGHT SIDE. COMES ALL THE WAY ACROSS TO THE LEFT. HAS IT BOUNCE OFF HIS RIGHT FOREARM. NEVER EVEN MAKES AN ATTEMPT TO GRAB THE BALL WITH HIS LEFT HAND. HE FINALLY MAKES A PASS AT IT. WOW, THAT'S SPECIAL. &gt;&gt; FIRST COMPLETION AND THE FIRST DOWN, AND THEN EDGERRIN JAMES. BROUGHT DOWN BY LARRY FOOTE AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. &gt;&gt; WELL, THAT'S THE THIRD TIME THE COLTS HAVE TRIED THE LEFT SIDE OF THE STEELER DEFENSE, AND THEY HAVE GOTTEN NOTHING. &gt;&gt; TROY POLAMALU IN THE THICK OF EVERYTHING. EVERYONE WONDERS ABOUT THE HAIR, AS WE DID. WE ASKED HIM, &quot;WHEN'S THE LAST TIME A HAIRCUT?&quot; HE SAID, &quot;USC, A TRIM.&quot; &gt;&gt; SAID A COACH ASKED HIM TO DO IT. WE SAID, &quot;IF A COACH ASKED YOU NOW, WOULD YOU DO IT?&quot; HE GOES, &quot;NO.&quot; [ BOTH LAUGH ] &quot;I'M A GROWN-UP NOW.&quot; &gt;&gt; &quot;MY WIFE? YES.&quot; [ WHISTLE BLOWS ] WAS HE DRAWN OFFSIDE? &gt;&gt; FALSE START, NUMBER 78, OFFENSE. 5-YARD PENALTY -- REMAINS SECOND DOWN. &gt;&gt; TARIK GLENN, THE LEFT TACKLE. &gt;&gt; TARIK GLENN, THE PLAYER THAT JUST GOT BEAT, ON THE FAR RIGHT OF YOUR SCREEN. PEYTON'S MAKING CALLS. WOW. THAT IS THE MOST SUBTLE -- THAT IS THE MOST SUBTLE OF DROPPING YOUR HIPS. HOWARD MUDD, THE OFFENSIVE LINE COACH -- YOU DON'T LIKE FALSE STARTS WHEN YOU'RE THE HOME TEAM. YOUR PLAYERS CAN HEAR THE QUARTERBACK CLEARLY. THERE'S REALLY NO EXCUSE FOR IT. AND AS YOU CAN SEE, OFFENSIVE TACKLES DON'T GET MUCH OF A BREAK. &gt;&gt; THE STEELERS, WHO WERE TICKETED WITH 5 FALSE STARTS BACK IN NOVEMBER, HAVE NOT COMMITTED ONE TODAY. HERE COMES THE PRESSURE, AND MANNING IS SLUGGED FROM BEHIND BY JAMES FARRIOR. I MEAN THAT IN THE MOST POSITIVE OF WAYS. HE HAD A CLEAN HIT ON THE QUARTERBACK. COULDN'T SEE HIM. &gt;&gt; WELL, IT'S ALL ABOUT PRESSURE. PEYTON MANNING, LIKE ANY OTHER QUARTERBACK, IS JUST HUMAN WHEN HE'S UNDER PRESSURE. THERE'S NOTHING SPECIAL ABOUT HIM WHEN HE'S TRYING TO DODGE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN HIS FACE. HE MIGHT BE THE HIGHEST-RATED QUARTERBACK IN THE LEAGUE, BUT HE'S JUST ANOTHER GUY WHEN HE'S ON THE GROUND. AND BIG BEN IS INTO IT. &gt;&gt; THIRD DOWN AND 24. MANNING DOESN'T SEE MANY OF THOSE. TO REGGIE WAYNE ON THE FLANKER SCREEN. FLAG DOWN, AND WAYNE IS, AS WELL, AT THE 35, WELL SHORT OF THE FIRST DOWN. TYRONE CARTER SEEING MORE AND MORE DUTY IN THE STEELER SECONDARY AS THE SEASON DEVELOPED, MADE THE TACKLE. &gt;&gt; INELIGIBLE MAN DOWNFIELD, NUMBER 73 OF THE OFFENSE. PENALTY IS DECLINED. FOURTH DOWN. &gt;&gt; AND THE STEELERS WILL GET THE BALL ON FOURTH AND 12. &gt;&gt; AND TONY DUNGY'S TEAMS JUST DON'T MAKE A LOT OF MISTAKES. AND THEY DO HAVE A PLAYOFF HISTORY, AND IT'S NOT A GOOD ONE WHEN THEY DON'T SCORE IN THE FIRST QUARTER. BUT TONY'S TEAMS TRADITIONALLY JUST DON'T MAKE MISTAKES. THEY DON'T BEAT THEMSELVES. AND THIS IS A CATASTROPHIC START FOR THE COLTS HERE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OFFENSIVELY. DEFENSIVELY, THEY'RE NOT DOING ANY BETTER, EITHER. &gt;&gt; AND THE PUNTER, HUNTER SMITH, MIGHT NOT PUNT AN AVERAGE OF 3 TIMES A GAME. THIS IS THE THIRD IN THE OPENING QUARTER. BEAUTIFUL HIT. ANTWAAN RANDLE EL CHECKS THE ONCOMING COLTS AND DOESN'T HAVE A CHANCE, DOWN AT THE 18. FIRST THERE WAS KELVIN HAYDEN, THE ROOKIE FROM ILLINOIS. IT WAS A VERY CONFIDENT GROUP OF STEELERS THAT ARRIVED HERE IN INDIANAPOLIS YESTERDAY AFTERNOON. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU'RE RIGHT, DICK. THEY WERE. &gt;&gt; YOU COULD SEE IT IN EVERY FACE, COULDN'T YOU? &gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY. [ CROWD CHEERS ] &gt;&gt; THEY START FROM THE 19 WITH A 14-0 LEAD HERE IN THE OPENING QUARTER. AND ROETHLISBERGER ESCAPES THE RUSH FOR A MOMENT. DOWN HE GOES AT THE 9! LARRY TRIPPLETT FINALLY FINISHED THE DEAL. &gt;&gt; WELL, MAYBE SOMETHING LIKE THIS CAN GET THE COLTS FIRED UP A LITTLE BIT DEFENSIVELY, 'CAUSE THAT WAS JUST GOOD, DISCIPLINED RUSHING BY THE DEFENSIVE LINE. &gt;&gt; ON SECOND AND 20, ROETHLISBERGER THROWS, AND IT'S HINES WARD AGAIN, CLOSE TO A FIRST DOWN OUT AT THE 26-YARD LINE. THAT PASS ON SECOND AND 20. ARMEN? &gt;&gt; AN UPDATE ON LEFT CORNERBACK NICK HARPER. HE'S GONE INTO THE LOCKER ROOM FOR FURTHER OBSERVATION AND TREATMENT FOR THAT INJURY TO HIS LEFT KNEE. MARLIN JACKSON, A ROOKIE FROM MICHIGAN, HAS REPLACED HIM, DICK. &gt;&gt; JACKSON, WHO WAS THE NUMBER-ONE DRAFT PICK OF THE COLTS THIS YEAR, THE EX-WOLVERINE, NOW PLAYING ON THAT LEFT CORNER. SHOTGUN ON THIRD AND 3. FIVE RECEIVERS. ROETHLISBERGER HIT FROM BEHIND AND THEN SHOVEL-PASSES INCOMPLETE. THROWING TO ANTWAAN RANDLE EL, WHO THOUGHT HE WAS HELD. DWIGHT FREENEY AGAIN HAD INVADED THE BACKFIELD. &gt;&gt; WELL, WHAT A SURPRISE -- NUMBER 93 GETTING IN ON THE QUARTERBACK. LOOK HOW FAR OUT HE IS. HE'S SO WIDE, MARVEL SMITH, THE LEFT TACKLE, DOESN'T EVEN SHOW UP IN THE PICTURE. OOH, THAT IS SERIOUS THERE. HE WENT UNDER THE LEGS OF RAHEEM BROCK, HIS TEAMMATE ON THE OTHER SIDE. WHAT SPEED. MARVEL SMITH BARELY GOT A TOUCH ON DWIGHT FREENEY BEFORE HE WAS ON ROETHLISBERGER. &gt;&gt; SO, CHRIS GARDOCKI PUNTS FOR THE FIRST TIME. IT WAS THE INITIAL STOPPAGE BY THE DEFENSE OF THE COLTS. THE OTHER TIME ON THE INTERCEPTION. LEFT-FOOTED BOOT SPINS DOWN TO TROY WALTERS. AND WALTERS, WITH A FLAG DOWN. AND ANOTHER ONE. AND EVERY INDICATION IS THAT GREAT EFFORT WILL BE COMING BACK. HE MADE IT TO THE 50-YARD LINE, BUT... &gt;&gt; DURING THE RETURN, ILLEGAL BLOCK IN THE BACK, NUMBER 94 ON THE RECEIVING TEAM. 10-YARD PENALTY, FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; MANNING READING THAT DEFENSE, AS THEY SHOW BLITZ. AND FIVE ARE COMING. MANNING JUST ABLE TO GET IT AWAY, AND HE WAS WELL-COVERED, REGGIE WAYNE. DESHEA TOWNSEND HAD POSITION. &gt;&gt; AND YOU GOT PEYTON MANNING SHAKING HIS HEAD. HE CAN'T FIND HARDLY ANYBODY THAT HE IS LOOKING FOR. OUTSIDE OF THE ONE COMPLETION THAT MARVIN HARRISON ONE-HANDED, WE HAVE SEEN ABSOLUTELY NOTHING OUT OF THE COLTS' PASSING GAME. &gt;&gt; WELL, THEY HAD, FIRST QUARTER, 25 YARDS OF OFFENSE, 24 BY HARRISON. &gt;&gt; ON THAT ONE CATCH. &gt;&gt; AND HE HAD TO GO ONE-HANDED TO GET THAT. HOW TOUGH CAN IT GET? BLITZ AGAIN. AND MANNING DUMPED AS HE TRIED TO FIND REGGIE WAYNE AND NOT CLOSE. &gt;&gt; HE'S MOTIONING TO WAYNE TO COME BACK AND BREAK YOUR PATTERN OFF A LITTLE SOONER, BUT PEYTON MANNING IS JUST GETTING OVERRUN. THIS TIME PRESSURE COMING. HE TAKES A HIT LATE. BOY, HE BOUNCED HIS HEAD OFF THE TURF. KIMO VON OELHOFFEN. BUT, AGAIN, PEYTON MANNING GOT RID OF THE FOOTBALL, EXPECTING REGGIE WAYNE TO RUN A DIFFERENT PATTERN THAN HE DID. &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE KIND OF PRESSURE THE CHARGERS PUT ON MANNING WHEN THEY DEFEATED THE COLTS AFTER WINNING THEIR FIRST 13, INDIANAPOLIS, OUT OF A 3-4 DEFENSE, A LA THE STEELERS. THIS THROW... INCOMPLETE TO WAYNE. AND HE HAD TWO MEN COVER HIM. TYRONE CARTER WAS THERE FIRST. AND ANOTHER QUICK THREE-AND-OUT FOR THE COLTS. &gt;&gt; AND I THINK THAT'S WHY PEYTON THREW THE BALL LONG, BECAUSE THAT WAS THE ONLY WAY HE DID WAS TO TRY TO GET IT HIGH ENOUGH THAT IT WOULDN'T BE INTERCEPTED. THAT REALLY REDUCED THE CHANCES OF WAYNE BEING ABLE TO MAKE A PLAY ON IT. BUT THIS IS [CHUCKLES] -- THIS IS REALLY SOMETHING, WATCHING THIS COLTS OFFENSE STRUGGLE. 14 POINTS WITH AN OFFENSE LIKE INDIANAPOLIS, LET'S FACE IT, IT'S NOT THAT BIG A DEAL. THEY CAN DO IT, BUT THEY BETTER START THINKING ABOUT LOOKING LIKE A GOOD OFFENSIVE TEAM PRETTY SOON. &gt;&gt; HUNTER SMITH, THIS ONE NOT QUITE AS GOOD AS HIS OTHER KICKS. ANTWAAN RANDLE EL AT THE 43. AND TACKLED AT THE 45 BY KELVIN HAYDEN. THE SIDELINE FOR THE STEELERS IS HOPPING, AS THEY LEAD, 14-0. JEROME BETTIS HAS ENTERED THE BACKFIELD ON THIS SERIES THAT BEGINS AT THE 44. &gt;&gt; ANOTHER OUTSTANDING FIELD POSITION FOR THE STEELERS. ANOTHER GOOD START. &gt;&gt; ROETHLISBERGER GOING DEEP. RANDLE EL. AND THAT SHOULD BE A FLAG. OH, MY. IT WAS MARLIN JACKSON, THE ROOKIE, WHO'S PLAYING BECAUSE NICK HARPER INJURED EARLY. IT APPEARED THAT JACKSON TACKLED HIM BEFORE THE BALL ARRIVED. &gt;&gt; WELL, THE BALL WAS UNDERTHROWN. SO, RANDLE EL HAS TO SLOW DOWN AND WAIT FOR THE FOOTBALL. NORMALLY, THIS BRINGS A FLAG. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. THAT'S MARLIN JACKSON, NUMBER 28. NOW, HE'S BEATEN THERE. THE BALL IS UNDERTHROWN. HOW THAT'S NOT INTERFERENCE, I HAVE NO IDEA AT ALL. &gt;&gt; I'M STUNNED. &gt;&gt; THAT IS BLATANT INTERFERENCE AND NOW THAT DIDN'T BRING A FLAG. AFTER LAST NIGHT, MAYBE THEY'RE AFRAID TO THROW AN INTERFERENCE FLAG. &gt;&gt; IT MIGHT HAVE SOME EFFECT. WILLIE PARKER ON THE SCREEN, AND HE GOT IT UP TO FULL SPEED AND AN 8-YARD PICKUP BEFORE CATO JUNE COULD BRING HIM DOWN. &gt;&gt; WELL, LOOK AT THAT. NICK HARPER IS COMING BACK OUT ONTO THE FIELD FOR THE COLTS. THAT WAS SOME SHOT HE TOOK ON HIS LEFT KNEE FROM THIS TEAMMATE MIKE DOSS. AND THAT IS REALLY GOOD NEWS FOR THIS DEFENSIVE TEAM, THAT THEY GET THEIR STARTING LEFT CORNERBACK OUT THERE. LOOK AT THAT. THE CROWD APPRECIATES IT. THEY NOTICED IT. &gt;&gt; THEY SPOT THE BALL AT THE INDIANAPOLIS 49. THIRD AND 3. &gt;&gt; VERRON HAYNES TAKES THE TOSS AND WITH SECOND EFFORT PICKS UP THE FIRST DOWN INSIDE THE 45. HE IS A NICE COMPLEMENT TO BETTIS AND PARKER. HAYNES A GOOD PASS RECEIVER. &gt;&gt; LET'S GO BACK AND LOOK AT THAT HIT THAT NICK HARPER TOOK IN THE FIRST QUARTER. WATCH HIS LEFT KNEE. LOOK HOW THAT THING FLEXES IN THERE LIKE THAT. LUCKILY, HE WAS ABLE TO GET IT UP OFF OF THE GROUND AT THE LAST MINUTE. HE'S GOT SOME FLEXIBILITY THERE TO BE ABLE TO COME BACK IN AND PLAY. GOOD FOR HIM. &gt;&gt; AND REMEMBER, THE OTHER LEG, THE THIGH, HAS A 3-STITCH WOUND IN IT. &gt;&gt; OH, I THINK AFTER THAT HIT, THAT DIDN'T HURT ANYMORE. &gt;&gt; SAD BUT TRUE. FIRST DOWN. AND IT'S PARKER. TOPPLED AFTER A SHORT GAIN BY BOB SANDERS, UP QUICKLY FROM HIS SAFETY SPOT. SANDERS, IN HIS SECOND YEAR, GOING TO HONOLULU. &gt;&gt; SO, WE HAVE THE TWO A.P. ALL-PRO SAFETIES IN THIS GAME. THE FREE SAFETY IS BOB SANDERS. THE STRONG SAFETY IS TROY POLAMALU, RIGHT THERE. WE ASKED BILL COWHER LAST NIGHT, &quot;WHAT DO YOU THINK OF BOB SANDERS?&quot; HE GOES, &quot;I LOVE BOB SANDERS.&quot; [ BOTH LAUGH ] AND HE SAID &quot;LOVE&quot; -- &gt;&gt; HE DID. &gt;&gt; &quot;I<i> LOVE</i> BOB SANDERS.&quot; AND I THINK BILL COWHER IS ECHOING EVERY OTHER COACH IN THIS LEAGUE. &gt;&gt; SECOND AND 9. ROETHLISBERGER CHASED BY FREENEY. FREENEY CAN'T GET HIM. NOW HE THROWS IT SHORT AND INCOMPLETE TO TUMAN, THE TIGHT END. THERE'S THAT MOBILITY. &gt;&gt; 6'5&quot;, 241, AND LOOK AT THE WAY BEN ROETHLISBERGER CAN MOVE AROUND. THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS COMPLETELY MISSING FROM THE MONDAY-NIGHT GAME. AFTER THREE WEEKS OFF, COMING OFF SURGERY, HE COULD NOT MOVE ANYWHERE CLOSE TO THAT. A LITTLE DOUG FLUTIE-LIKE THERE. &gt;&gt; TURF SHOES. HE SAID HE WAS WEARING ONLY TURF SHOES NOW ON THE ARTIFICIAL CARPET, AS WE HAVE TODAY. MIKE VANDERJAGT, THE PLACEKICKER, LEADING THE CHEERS FOR THE COLTS. &gt;&gt; IT'S WHAT ALL KICKERS SHOULD BE DOING WHEN THEY'RE NOT KICKING. &gt;&gt; THAT'S LOVE AGAIN. THIRD AND 9. CHASED OUT OF THE POCKET. THROWS DEEP DOWNFIELD! ALMOST INTERCEPTED. IN AND OUT OF THE HANDS OF MIKE DOSS. THREE MEN COVERING INTENDED RECEIVER CEDRICK WILSON. &gt;&gt; OH, BEN DID A GREAT JOB AGAIN OF BUYING HIMSELF SOME EXTRA TIME. HE IS RUN OUT OF THE POCKET THAT TIME BY MONTAE REAGOR, AND HE DOES A GOOD JOB OF SETTING UP, SQUARING UP. BUT THE BALL JUST FLOATS ON HIM. THE BALL JUST SAILS A LITTLE BIT. THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A COMPLETION IF HE COULD HAVE MAYBE HAD IT JUST A FOOT, 18 INCHES LOWER. &gt;&gt; CHRIS GARDOCKI, WITH TROY WALTERS BACK INSIDE THE 10-YARD LINE. GARDOCKI, WHO HAS KICKED WELL OVER 1,100 TIMES IN HIS LONG NFL CAREER WITHOUT HAVING A PUNT BLOCKED. SENDS IT VERY HIGH. WALTERS GONNA LET IT BOUNCE, AND NOW THE COLTS WILL START ON THE 2-YARD LINE. PEYTON MANNING, 2-FOR-9 AT THE START, ONLY 37 YARDS, OPENS THIS SERIES ON HIS OWN 2. GIVEN UP THE MIDDLE TO EDGERRIN JAMES, AND THAT'S THE ONLY PLACE THAT THE COLTS HAVE NOT TRIED, AND IT DOESN'T GET MUCH YARDAGE THERE, EITHER. THEY'VE TRIED THE STRETCH PLAY, THEY'VE TRIED THE PASSES, AND THE STEELERS HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS. &gt;&gt; WELL, APPARENTLY PITTSBURGH TOOK OFFENSE TO EDGERRIN JAMES RUNNING ON THEM FOR 124 YARDS IN LATE NOVEMBER. AND TOM MOORE, HE'S GOT TO BE WONDERING RIGHT NOW. NOW, PEYTON MANNING HAS SO MUCH FLEXIBILITY IN CALLING HIS PLAYS. BUT UP TO THIS POINT AND TIME, THE PLAYBOOK IS RUNNING DRY. &gt;&gt; ONLY A YARD ON THE FIRST PLAY AND NOW THE STRETCH TO JAMES. AND HE FINALLY SEES SOME DAYLIGHT. GETS OUT ACROSS THE 10. LOOKS AS IF HE HAS A FIRST DOWN AT THE 13. CHRIS HOPE AND IKE TAYLOR IN THE SECONDARY MAKE THE TACKLE. &gt;&gt; WELL, HE TRIED THE STRETCH PLAY TO THE RIGHT SIDE AND DIDN'T GET MUCH GOING. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THEY REALLY RUN IT TO THE LEFT, AND THEY GET SOME GOOD BLOCKING OUT IN FRONT. THEY GET SOME GOOD WORK, AND THEY FINALLY LET EDGERRIN JAMES GET INTO THE SECOND LEVEL BEFORE HE HAS TO TAKE SOMEBODY ON. AND DESHEA TOWNSEND FINDS OUT RIGHT OFF THE BAT THAT'S NOT EASILY DONE. BUT THAT'S THE FIRST TIME JAMES HAD A CHANCE. &gt;&gt; RYAN LILJA HAD THE CLEARING BLOCK. HERE'S JAMES THE OTHER WAY AND DRAWS A CROWD, AS HE CROSSES THE 15. CLARK HAGGANS, THE UNDERRATED LINEBACKER -- NOT SO IN PITTSBURGH BUT AROUND THE COUNTRY. WITH JOEY PORTER GETTING ALL THE HEADLINES, IT'S EASY TO OVERLOOK HAGGANS, THE LINEBACKER ON THE OTHER SIDE. HE HAD 9 SACKS THIS YEAR, A CAREER HIGH, AND 4 FORCED FUMBLES. HE MAKES PLAYS. &gt;&gt; WERE YOU TONGUE-IN-CHEEK WHEN YOU SAID, &quot;JOEY PORTER GETS ALL THE HEADLINES&quot;? [ BOTH LAUGH ] &gt;&gt; HE DID THIS WEEK. &gt;&gt; HE GOT THEM ALL HERE IN INDIANAPOLIS THIS WEEK. &gt;&gt; SECOND DOWN AND 6. MANNING. OPEN IS DALLAS CLARK, AND THE TIGHT END HAS A FIRST DOWN AT THE 38-YARD LINE. IKE TAYLOR BROUGHT HIM DOWN. &gt;&gt; OH, HOW DESPERATELY DID INDIANAPOLIS NEED THAT PLAY? THEY'RE COMING OUT FROM THEIR OWN END ZONE, AND THEY NEEDED A BIG PLAY. AND THIS IS JUST VINTAGE INDIANAPOLIS. DALLAS CLARK COMING ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE FIELD. AND FINALLY THEY'RE GETTING TO MOVE THE CHAINS -- BACK-TO-BACK FIRST DOWNS. THEY MUST BE FLUSH WITH SUCCESS, THESE GUYS. FINALLY, THEY'RE STARTING TO LOOK LIKE THEIR OLD SELVES. &gt;&gt; 8 1/2 MINUTES LEFT IN THIS OPENING HALF, 14-0 THE DEFICIT STARING AT MANNING AND THE COLTS. MAKING MORE MOVES THAN A ROMAN TRAFFIC OFFICER. AND IT'S JAMES FINDING DAYLIGHT AGAIN, THE LEFT SIDE. POLAMALU FINALLY MAKES THE HIT. FIRST DOWN AT THE 45. THREE FIRST DOWNS IN SUCCESSION. &gt;&gt; WELL, POLAMALU MAKES A HIT, BUT THEN POLAMALU GOES FOR A RIDE. EDGERRIN JAMES, BOY, IS HE FINISHING A RUN HERE. AND FINALLY WE'RE SEEING SOME POWER OUT OF THIS RUNNING GAME. AGAIN, HE'S GONNA GET INTO THE SECOND LEVEL. BUT WATCH POLAMALU HERE. THERE HE COMES. HE GOES DOWN. HE'S BACK UP. GREAT FINISH AND GREAT POWER. AND LOOK AT THE MARK ON THE HELMET OF EDGERRIN JAMES. THAT'S FROM TROY POLAMALU. &gt;&gt; EVERYTHING BUT THE NUMBER 43 THERE. 15 YARDS ON THAT LAST RUN. MANNING. COMPLETE. IT'S TO THE TIGHT END FLETCHER, BRYAN FLETCHER, HIS FIRST CATCH. ANOTHER FIRST DOWN, FOUR IN A ROW. &gt;&gt; AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, THE CROWD HERE STARTING TO SENSE, &quot;WHOA, OUR BOYS ARE FINALLY WAKING UP.&quot; &gt;&gt; BRYAN FLETCHER, A SIXTH-ROUND PICK BY THE BEARS AND PICKED UP BY THE COLTS. HE PLAYED AT UCLA. DOMINIC RHODES IN FOR EDGERRIN JAMES ON THIS PLAY. AND RHODES ON THE STRETCH. AND THE STEELERS SWING HIM WIDE TO CUT OFF THE PATH. A GAIN OF A COUPLE. JAMES FARRIOR AND BRETT KEISEL IN ON THE TACKLE. &gt;&gt; BUT IF THE COLTS CAN JUST START MAKING A LITTLE NOISE WITH THEIR RUNNING GAME, ALL OF A SUDDEN, THE PLAY-ACTION THAT FOLLOWS BECOMES IMPORTANT. ALL OF A SUDDEN IT BECOMES CREDIBLE. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN SELL THEM THE FAKE AND GIVE MANNING MORE TIME. JAMES BACK IN. QUICK THROW UNDERNEATH TO REGGIE WAYNE, SHORT YARDAGE TO THE 30, ONLY A 4-YARD PICKUP. FARRIOR THE TACKLER. &gt;&gt; WE SEE PEYTON MANNING UP AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE, GOING THROUGH HIS CHECK-OFFS, CHANGING PROTECTION, CALLING PLAYS, AUDIBLING. HE SAID ONE THING ABOUT IT, THOUGH. &quot;SOMETIMES I THINK I CAN TALK A TEAM OFF OF A BLITZ.&quot; HE SAID, &quot;NOT THE STEELERS.&quot; HE SAID, &quot;I KNOW GOING IN, IF THEY'VE MADE A COMMITMENT TO WHERE THEY'RE GONNA COME ON THE OVERLOAD BLITZ, I CAN'T DO ANYTHING UP THERE THAT'S GONNA TALK THEM OFF OF IT. THEY'RE COMING NO MATTER WHAT I DO.&quot; &gt;&gt; THAT &quot;BLITZBURGH&quot; MENTAL STATE. THE SPIRIT OF COWHER'S DEFENSE. HERE COMES POLAMALU WITH A RUNNING START, BUT THEY MAKE THE PLAY TO FLETCHER AND A FIRST DOWN. SO, THEY PICKED THE RIGHT CALL, DID MANNING THERE, AS POLAMALU WAS FLYING IN. &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S A TEAM GAME. IT WORKED BECAUSE BRYAN FLETCHER MAKES THE ADJUSTMENT. BRYAN FLETCHER IS READY FOR THE FOOTBALL. WE SAW BEFORE PEYTON MANNING LOOKING FOR RECEIVERS THAT WEREN'T THERE. FLETCHER REALIZES IT'S A BLITZ. HE PASSES POLAMALU ON THE WAY AND IMMEDIATELY TURNS AROUND AND BECOMES A TARGET. NOW POLAMALU, HE TIMES THIS PRETTY WELL, BUT NOT MUCH YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT WHEN IT'S A COORDINATED OFFENSE. &gt;&gt; THAT WAS INDIANAPOLIS' FIRST THIRD-DOWN CONVERSION IN THIS OPENING HALF. FIVE STRAIGHT FIRST DOWNS ON THIS DRIVE THAT BEGAN AT THE 2. EDGERRIN JAMES, EXCELLENT RECEIVER. CAUGHT 44 PASSES DURING THE REGULAR YEAR. FARRIOR AND TAYLOR COLLABORATED ON THE STOP. &gt;&gt; AND FINALLY WE'RE LOOKING AT THE OFFENSE THAT WE ALL EXPECTED TO SEE. THEY'RE IN SYNC. THEY'RE MAKING JUST THE EASY PLAYS. YOU CAN SEE RIGHT THERE, THEY WERE TIED FOR SECOND IN THE NFL, SCORING 37 TIMES. NOT A COMBINATION OF TOUCHDOWNS AND FIELD GOALS -- 37 TOUCHDOWNS. &gt;&gt; JAMES. TO THE 10, TO THE 8. &gt;&gt; JAMES FARRIOR, PLEASE REPORT TO THE LOCKER ROOM. PICK UP SOME OF THE EQUIPMENT THAT EDGERRIN JAMES JUST FAKED YOU OUT OF RIGHT THERE. WHAT A MOVE! WHAT A MOVE JAMES PUTS ON FARRIOR, WHO'S UNBLOCKED. WATCH JAMES FARRIOR COME INTO THE PICT-- WHOA! [ LAUGHS ] LOOK AT THAT MOVE THERE, THAT HE GOES BACK TO THE INSIDE, AND HE LEAVES JAMES FARRIOR GASPING AT AIR. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, EDGERRIN JAMES AND THE RUNNING GAME A FACTOR. &gt;&gt; 44 YARDS, AS YOU SEE ON OUR STAT TRAX. FIRST AND GOAL AT THE 9. JAMES UP THE MIDDLE. AND THE STEELERS WAITING AFTER A COUPLE. JOEY PORTER LED THE CHARGE. &gt;&gt; WELL, THIS IS REALLY INDIANAPOLIS DOING WHAT THEY SO DESPERATELY WANTED TO DO -- ESTABLISH EDGERRIN JAMES. AGAIN, HE WAS THE DIFFERENCE MAKER IN THE FIRST GAME -- HIM BEING ABLE TO RUN THE BALL AND POUND IT IN THERE. THEY KEPT THE STEELERS OFFENSE ON THE SIDELINES. AND FINALLY WE'RE SEEING SOME SIGNS OF THAT RUNNING GAME. &gt;&gt; 12th PLAY THAT BEGAN BACK AT THE 2-YARD LINE. THIS IS THE 13th NOW. FAKE TO JAMES. &gt;&gt; JAMES IS WIDE OPEN. &gt;&gt; HE WAS OPEN. BURROWS HIS WAY TO THE GOAL LINE. DOESN'T GET IN. LARRY FOOTE DENIED THE TOUCHDOWN. &gt;&gt; THAT WAS ONLY APPARENT TO EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THIS STADIUM. &gt;&gt; EVEN I SAW THAT ONE! &gt;&gt; AFTER THE FAKE, NOBODY FROM PITTSBURGH GETS OUT ON EDGERRIN JAMES. ALL THE SUDDEN, AT THE LAST MINUTE, DESHEA TOWNSEND COMES UP, TRIES TO GET IN ON IT. &gt;&gt; JAMES -- YOU KNOW A LOT OF TIMES YOU'LL SEE A BACK MAKE A FAKE LIKE THAT. JAMES ALMOST DIDN'T TURN AROUND. ALL OF THE SUDDEN, HE TURNED AROUND JUST AT THE RIGHT TIME. HERE WAS THE BALL. &gt;&gt; MANNING WAS GOING THERE ALL ALONG. &gt;&gt; THIRD AND GOAL. &gt;&gt; JAMES -- NO, IT IS MUNGRO. JAMES MUNGRO, BUT NO PLAY, NO PLAY. A FLAG DOWN. THERE WAS MOVEMENT BEFORE THE SNAP. &gt;&gt; AND NOBODY IS HAPPIER ABOUT THAT THAN TRAVIS KIRSCHKE. &gt;&gt; FALSE START, NUMBER 78, OFFENSE. 5-YARD PENALTY -- REMAINS THIRD DOWN. &gt;&gt; THE SECOND ONE CALLED ON TARIK GLENN. &gt;&gt; SO, TOUCHDOWN DENIED. IT'S THIRD AND GOAL NOW FROM THE 6-YARD LINE. &gt;&gt; TARIK GLENN -- YOU SEE HIM RIGHT THERE -- THE LEFT TACKLE COMES UP AND OUT OF HIS STANCE TO GO DOWN AND MAKE THE DOWN BLOCK. THAT'S, AGAIN -- THAT'S A LITTLE OF THAT RUST. IT'S HARD TO SHAKE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S AS ANIMATED AS TONY DUNGY WILL GET. &gt;&gt; YOU JUST DON'T GET FALSE STARTS AT HOME. YOU'RE AT HOME, FOR GOD'S SAKE. [ WHISTLE BLOWS ] &gt;&gt; AND THIS TIME, IT'S AARON SMITH, WHO LURCHED OFFSIDE. DIDN'T MAKE CONTACT, BUT THAT INDUCED THE RIGHT TACKLE, DIEM, TO MOVE. &gt;&gt; THEY HOPE. JAKE SCOTT, 73, CAME OUT AND WENT AFTER SMITH. HE BETTER HAVE CAUGHT HIM IN THE NEUTRAL ZONE. [ CROWD CHEERS ] HE DID. &gt;&gt; HALF THE DISTANCE TO THE GOAL, NUMBER 95. STILL THIRD DOWN. &gt;&gt; AND THIS HUNGRY CROWD FOR SOMETHING POSITIVE, LIKE THAT CALL. FIRST STEELER PENALTY. &gt;&gt; I THINK IF THEY'RE GONNA KICK A FIELD GOAL, THEY MIGHT ELECT TO GO WITH A PASS. &gt;&gt; 3-YARD LINE. THIRD DOWN AND GOAL. &gt;&gt; THAT'S FROM ALL MY YEARS OF BEING AN OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR IN THE LEAGUE. &gt;&gt; [ LAUGHS ] YOU'D SAY RUN IT. &gt;&gt; RUN IT! &gt;&gt; THREE WIDE RECEIVERS. STOKLEY IN THE SLOT RIGHT. HARRISON FAR RIGHT AND WAYNE TO THE LEFT. EDGERRIN JAMES THE RUNNING BACK. AND IT'S JAMES. AND HE DOESN'T GET MUCH AT ALL. SECOND EFFORT, A YARD, AND AARON SMITH WAS THERE FIRST. SO, IT'S FOURTH AND GOAL AT THE 2, AND OUT COMES VANDERJAGT. THEY'LL KICK THE FIELD GOAL. &gt;&gt; YEAH, AND AFTER NOT EVEN GETTING A SNIFF. THEY RAN THE FOOTBALL, BUT THEY GOT NOTHING. THIS IS A STOUT DEFENSIVE FOOTBALL TEAM AGAINST THE RUN. AND, TONY, JUST COME AWAY WITH POINTS. &gt;&gt; THAT'S TOO LONG A DRIVE, A 9:00 DRIVE FROM THEIR OWN 2-YARD LINE TO THEIR OPPONENTS' 2-YARD LINE, AND NOW THEY'LL SETTLE FOR THE 3, APPARENTLY. JUST A 20-YARD ATTEMPT. JOSE CORTEZ, THE WELL-TRAVELED KICKER -- WITH DALLAS EARLIER THIS YEAR -- HAD BEEN PICKED UP IN DECEMBER BY INDIANAPOLIS FOR HIS KICKOFF LENGTH. AND THERE'S AN EXAMPLE OF IT. HE POUNDS ONE HALFWAY INTO THE END ZONE, AND IKE TAYLOR TAKES THE TOUCHBACK. WE'LL SEE NOW COWHER'S MOVE. 14-3 -- WILL HE TAKE ANY CHANCES? WELL, THERE'S A SAFE PLAY, THE SCREEN TO VERRON HAYNES. AND HE IS DUMPED AT THE 19-YARD LINE, A LOSS OF 1. ROBERT MATHIS, A SPEEDY, SMALL DEFENSIVE END/LINEBACKER AT 6'2&quot;, 235. &gt;&gt; THE BALL CAME OUT OF THERE KIND OF FUNNY. DID SOMEBODY GET A HAND ON THIS THING? YEAH, RIGHT THERE, DWIGHT FREENEY. FREENEY JUST GRAZED IT WITH A FINGERTIP. AGAIN, HAYNES WAS ABLE TO STAY WITH IT, BUT DWIGHT FREENEY, HE DID TOUCH IT. &gt;&gt; SO, IT'S SECOND DOWN AND A LONG 10. MARVIN HARRISON, THE EVER-LACONIC POSITION. &gt;&gt; MARVIN ALWAYS DEEP IN CONVERSATION WITH HIS TEAMMATES. &gt;&gt; AND ON SECOND DOWN, THE DRAW PLAY, AND IT'S PARKER PICKING UP 3. NICK HARPER TACKLES PARKER. &gt;&gt; AND THAT WAS A GOOD TACKLE BY NICK HARPER. FOR A GUY THAT'S GOT A CUT ON HIS RIGHT LEG, A REALLY FLEXED-OUT KNEE ON HIS LEFT THAT FORCED HIM INTO THE LOCKER ROOM. THAT WAS A GOOD EFFORT. [ CROWD CHEERS ] INDY TRYING TO GET THE CROWD BACK IN IT HERE. THEY COULD USE THEIR HELP. &gt;&gt; PARKER THE RUNNING BACK. ROETHLISBERGER DEEP DOWN THE MIDDLE, INCOMPLETE. AND A FLAG DOWN. ANTWAAN RANDLE EL WAS HELD. &gt;&gt; PRIOR TO THE PASS, HOLDING, NUMBER 21 OF THE DEFENSE. 5-YARD PENALTY -- AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; WELL, THEY FLAGGED BOB SANDERS. MIKE DOSS WAS CERTAINLY ACTING LIKE -- BOB EXPRESSING HIS DISPLEASURE WITH BEING THE GUY THAT GOT FLAGGED. THE STEELERS NOW HAVE 3 TIME-OUTS. THE ROLES MIGHT HAVE SHIFTED RIGHT HERE. &gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY. &gt;&gt; THE WAY BEN HAS BEEN THROWING THE FOOTBALL -- BILL COWHER BY NATURE LIKES TO SIT ON A LEAD. BUT THE WAY BEN HAS BEEN THROWING IT, I'D TRUST HIM. &gt;&gt; FOUR WIDES AND VERRON HAYNES IN THE BACKFIELD. HAND-OFF TO HAYNES. TRIPPED UP AS HE HIT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. GOT UP. THEY DIDN'T MARK HIM DOWN. SO, APPARENTLY, HE FELL OVER HIS OWN BLOCKER, AND BRACKETT AND MARLIN JACKSON MAKE THE TACKLE. SECOND DOWN AT THE 32. CLOCK RUNNING. &gt;&gt; THE STEELERS -- THEY'RE GONNA BE CONTENT TO GO ON IN WITH THIS 14-3 LEAD. &gt;&gt; WHAT A POWERFUL START TO THIS PLAYOFF GAME. THE OPENING DRIVE SO INCREDIBLY IMPRESSIVE, AS BEN ROETHLISBERGER, A 36-YARD PASS TO HEATH MILLER AND THEN ANOTHER 18 YARDS TO MILLER, AND FINALLY A TOUCHDOWN THROW TO RANDLE EL, AS THEY MARCHED 84 YARDS IN 10 PLAYS TO SCORE, 7-0, AND MADE IT LOOK TOO EASY. [ WHISTLE BLOWS ] ROETHLISBERGER TAKES A KNEE, FINAL PLAY OF THE OPENING HALF. A 14-3 PITTSBURGH STEELER ADVANTAGE. AND THE STEELERS, TRUE TO THEIR PROMISE, PLAY WELL ON THE ROAD. THEY WERE 6-2 THIS YEAR ON THE SEASON, AND THEY CERTAINLY WERE OUTSTANDING, ESPECIALLY IN THAT FIRST QUARTER. &gt;&gt; AND THE STEELERS RIGHT NOW HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF FANS OUT IN COLORADO, DON'T THEY? [ BOTH LAUGH ] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. THOSE BRONCO FAN SAID, &quot;WE WANT THE HOME-FIELD ADVANTAGE NEXT WEEK.&quot; &gt;&gt; THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. THAT'S WHERE THE AFC CHAMPIONSHIP GAME WOULD BE IF PITTSBURGH WINS. &gt;&gt; IF INDY WINS, DENVER COMES TO INDIANAPOLIS. DOMINIC RHODES MUFFS THE OPENING KICKOFF OF THE SECOND HALF AND THEN RETURNS OUT TO THE 19-YARD LINE. SO, LET'S SEE HOW MANNING AND THE COLTS HAVE ADJUSTED AFTER THE DEFENSE OF PITTSBURGH STYMIED THEM MOST OF THE FIRST HALF. THEY COME OUT THROWING, AND IT'S A SCREEN TO JAMES, WELL-READ BY IKE TAYLOR. CAME UP QUICKLY TO MAKE THE TACKLE AND A GAIN OF ONLY 4. MANNING HANDING OFF TO JAMES, TRYING THAT LEFT SIDE, WHERE THEY'VE HAD MORE SUCCESS, AND HE DRAGS A TACKLER TO THE 27, WHERE IT WILL BE THIRD AND 2. JAMES FARRIOR AROUND HIS ANKLES. MANNING HAS COMPLETED NOW 7 PASSES IN A ROW, GOING BACK TO THE END OF THE OPENING HALF. WHAT'S THE CALL HERE ON THIRD AND 2? THE ONLY PLAYOFF WIN WHEN TRAILING AT THE HALF -- SUPER BOWL V. &gt;&gt; THAT WAS A WHILE AGO. &gt;&gt; IS THAT THE JIM O'BRIEN SUPER BOWL? &gt;&gt; THEY WERE THE BALTIMORE COLTS BACK THEN. &gt;&gt; O'BRIEN KICKING A FIELD GOAL TO WIN A LOW-SCORING GAME. IN HEAVY TRAFFIC, ABLE TO THROW IT TO WAYNE, AND REGGIE WAYNE HAS THE FIRST DOWN AT THE 35. MANNING WAS IN HEAVY TRAFFIC, AND SO WAS WAYNE. &gt;&gt; WELL, AND ONE OF THE FEW TIMES WE'VE SEEN WHERE PEYTON HAS GONE DOWNFIELD AND A RECEIVER WAS EXACTLY WHERE HE EXPECTED HIM TO BE. THIS WAS A LASER SHOT FROM PEYTON, AND DESHEA TOWNSEND, HARD TO HAVE A WHOLE LOT BETTER COVERAGE. BUT REGGIE WAYNE DOES A GOOD JOB OF SCREENING TOWNSEND AWAY WITH HIS BODY. &gt;&gt; PHONE-BOOTH THROW BY MANNING RIGHT OVER THE TOP. EDGERRIN JAMES LOOKED AS IF HE WAS GOING TO GET MORE, AND THE CROWD, YOU COULD FEEL THE SWELL OF THEIR ENTHUSIASM. BUT TROY POLAMALU ENDED THE PARTY QUICKLY AT THE 40-YARD LINE. NOW THEY'RE GONNA MARK IT AT THE 39. HERE HE COMES, NUMBER 43, THE FLOWING LOCKS -- IT'S MORE OF A BLOCK THAN IT IS A TACKLE. NO ATTEMPT AT WRAPPING UP, BUT HE PUTS A SHOULDER RIGHT ON THE THIGH, AND THAT GETS IT DONE. &gt;&gt; GAIN OF ONLY 3, WHEN IT LOOKED AS IF IT WAS DESTINED FOR MUCH BETTER. [ CROWD CHEERS ] QUICK THROW, AND IS IT INTERCEPTED BY POLAMALU? &gt;&gt; NO, THE OFFICIAL'S WAVING IT OFF. HE'S MARKING IT DOWN AT THE 49. AND POLAMALU QUICKLY TRYING TO INFLUENCE BY HEADING TOWARD THE GOAL LINE. &gt;&gt; DEFENSIVE BACKS WORK ON THIS EVERY DAY. THEY CALL IT THE TIP DRILL BECAUSE THE BALL GETS HIT, AND UP IT GOES. AND TROY POLAMALU JUST TRYING TO MAKE UP GROUND TO GET THERE. WHOA. HE INITIALLY GOT HIS HANDS UNDER THE BALL. WHEN HE FIRST DOVE FOR THAT BALL, HE GOT HIS HANDS UNDERNEATH THERE. THAT MIGHT BE WORTH A SECOND LOOK. &gt;&gt; NO RED FLAG FROM COWHER. &gt;&gt; WELL, POLAMALU'S NOT ARGUING, SO, HE FEELS HE LOST IT AFTERWARDS. &gt;&gt; THIRD AND 7. QUICK THROW TO CLARK, AND A QUICK HIT BY CHRIS HOPE THAT DENIES A FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; LOOK AT IT AGAIN. IT LOOKED LIKE TROY POLAMALU GOT BOTH HIS HANDS UNDERNEATH THE FOOTBALL INITIALLY. I MEAN, RIGHT THERE HE'S KEEPING THE BALL OFF THE GROUND, BUT THEN... &gt;&gt; THERE. &gt;&gt; ...HE LOSES IT. YEAH, IT COMES OFF HIS HANDS. YEP, IT CAME OFF HIS HAND AND ROLLED UP HIS CHEST A LITTLE BIT. INITIALLY, THAT WAS FABULOUS. &gt;&gt; POLAMALU, WHO HAD AN INTERCEPTION OF MANNING IN THAT NOVEMBER GAME. AND YOU JUST NEVER KNOW WHERE YOU'RE GONNA FIND HIM. HE HAD ONE LAST WEEK AGAINST CINCINNATI. HUNTER SMITH. ANTWAAN RANDLE EL, FAIR CATCH AT THE 23-YARD LINE. &gt;&gt; TROY POLAMALU, A MAN OF DEEP FAITH, A VERY SPIRITUAL MAN. &gt;&gt; AND PASSIONATE. HE USED THAT WORD FOUR OR FIVE TIMES IN OUR CONVERSATION. PASSIONATE ABOUT LIFE AND ABOUT PLAYING THIS GAME AND HIS RELIGION. WILLIE PARKER SHOWING YOU THAT 4.3 SPEED AROUND THE CORNER. CLOSE TO A FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; WELL, THIS DRIVE RIGHT NOW IS GOING TO TELL US I THINK A LOT ABOUT THE DIRECTION OF THIS FOOTBALL GAME. INDIANAPOLIS CAME OUT AFTER ALL THE ADJUSTMENTS THEY MADE AT HALFTIME. WASN'T ABLE TO GET ANYTHING DONE. RIGHT NOW I THINK THE STEELERS HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY SERVE NOTICE THAT THE COLTS ARE GONNA HAVE TO SHIFT GEARS DRAMATICALLY IF THEY'RE GONNA WIN THIS GAME. &gt;&gt; YOU SAW ROETHLISBERGER'S RATING -- 105-PLUS. HE WAS THIRD IN THE LEAGUE IN THE REGULAR SEASON, BEHIND MANNING AND CARSON PALMER. AND HE'S ACCURATE. RIGHT ON THE MONEY TO ANTWAAN RANDLE EL AND A FIRST DOWN AT THE 46-YARD LINE. &gt;&gt; WELL, WE'RE GETTING A CLINIC ON HOW TO THROW THE FOOTBALL, AND IT'S BEING PUT ON BY NUMBER 7. YOU MIGHT HAVE SIGNED UP TO SEE THE OTHER PROFESSOR, BUT THE VISITING PROFESSOR IS THE GUY THAT'S TEACHING THE CLASS RIGHT NOW. LOOK AT THE ACCURACY THAT BEN ROETHLISBERGER DEMONSTRATES IN THROWING A FOOTBALL. &gt;&gt; AND THE QUICKNESS HE GETS THE BALL OUT. 13-FOR-20 IN THE GAME FOR BIG BEN AND 185 YARDS, 2 TOUCHDOWNS. CROWD NOT SO ENTHUSIASTIC. NOT MUCH NOISE. AND THIS WILL HELP OUT, AS THEY ARE ABLE TO HIT PARKER IN THE BACKFIELD. MONTAE REAGOR FIRST TO INVADE. &gt;&gt; THE STEELERS, A LOT OF TIMES IN TRYING TO RUN THE BALL THIS AFTERNOON HAVE HAD TO DEAL WITH COLTS DEFENSIVE LINEMEN IN THEIR BACKFIELD. THEN, OF COURSE, YOU KNOW JOHN TEERLINCK, THEIR DEFENSIVE LINE COACH -- PENETRATION IS EVERYTHING. GET UPFIELD. ATTACK THE QUARTERBACK. THERE'S BIG JOHN. WHEN I SAY &quot;BIG JOHN,&quot; YOU CAN IDENTIFY WHICH ONE IS JOHN. BUT IT IS GET UPFIELD. PLAY THE PASS. IF IT'S A RUNNING PLAY, HEY, THE GUY WILL COME TO YOU. &gt;&gt; LONGTIME DEFENSIVE LINEMAN IN THE LEAGUE. SECOND AND 13. SCREEN AND IT SHOULD WORK. BLOCKERS FOR PARKER, AND HE'S ALL THE WAY TO THE 45 OF THE STEELERS' BEFORE BOB SANDERS, ANOTHER LOW-CHOPPING TACKLE, JUST SHY OF THE FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; WELL, SCREEN TO SPEED, AND THAT'S WHAT THE STEELERS ARE DOING HERE. THEY'RE GOING TO DWIGHT FREENEY'S SIDE. WILLIE PARKER GIVES HIM THE WAVE. JUST LETS FREENEY GO ON BY. HE KIND OF DIDN'T LET HIS BLOCKERS GET SET UP. HERE GOES DWIGHT FREENEY. GOES RIGHT BY PARKER, AND BY THE TIME HE GETS TO BEN, THE BALL IS GONE. PARKER COULD HAVE MAYBE SHOWN A LITTLE MORE PATIENCE. LET MARVEL SMITH AND FANECA GET SET UP DOWNFIELD. &gt;&gt; THIRD AND A LONG YARD, AND &quot;THE BUS&quot; IS IN FOR PITTSBURGH. BETTIS, A DETROIT NATIVE, WANTS TO GO TO THE SUPER BOWL IN THE MOTOR CITY. SUPER BOWL XL -- ISN'T THAT -- YOU SAID EXTRA LARGE, BUT HE IS. &gt;&gt; I HEARD SOMEBODY SAY SUPER BOWL 40. I THOUGHT IT WAS SUPER BOWL EXTRA LARGE. WELL, I PASSED EXTRA LARGE WHEN I WAS ABOUT 12. &gt;&gt; HE QUALIFIES. &gt;&gt; GOOD HOLE INSIDE. JEROME DIDN'T HAVE TO TAKE ANYBODY ON UNTIL HE WAS 2 OR 3 YARDS INTO THAT RUN. GOOD SURGE, GOOD BLOCKING. HARTINGS, THE CENTER, HEADED TO HIS SECOND PRO BOWL. KENDALL SIMMONS, GOOD WORK INSIDE. &gt;&gt; PARKER BACK IN. AND IT'S PARKER. BIG HOLE AGAIN. HE SLASHES TO THE 37-YARD LINE, A GAIN OF AT LEAST 5 MORE BEFORE NICK HARPER CAN MAKE THE TACKLE. INTERESTING STORY, AND THERE ARE SO MANY OF THEM IN THIS GAME. WITH ALL THE STAR POWER OF THESE TWO TEAMS, SO MUCH OF THE EFFORT OF THEIR SEASON DEPENDED ON MEN THAT WEREN'T EVEN DRAFTED -- FREE AGENTS, PLAYERS THAT WERE OVERLOOKED EVEN IN COLLEGE, WILLIE PARKER BEING ONE OF THEM. AS A SENIOR, HIS LAST GAME AT NORTH CAROLINA, ON SENIOR DAY, DIDN'T EVEN GET ON THE FIELD. [ CROWD CHEERS ] RUSHED FOR MORE YARDS THIS YEAR AS A PRO THAN HE DID FOUR YEARS WITH THE TAR HEELS. HE GETS IT AGAIN. AND HAS A FIRST DOWN, AS HE DRIVES THROUGH THE TACKLE OF DAVID THORNTON, DOWN TO THE 31. &gt;&gt; AND TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. IN THE HISTORY OF THE STEELERS FRANCHISE, YOU SEE THAT BARRY FOSTER SITS ATOP THE LIST WITH A 1,690, BUT WILLIE PARKER MAKES AN APPEARANCE. AFTER EVERY SERIES, WILLIE PARKER COMES OFF TO FIND BETTIS WAITING FOR HIM. &gt;&gt; SAID, &quot;HE'S TUTORED ME NOT ONLY ON THE FIELD BUT MY BEHAVIOR OFF THE FIELD.&quot; PARKER HIT IN THE BACKFIELD THIS TIME, BROUGHT DOWN BY CATO JUNE. YOU SAID HE WON THE JOB BY DEFAULT TWO YEARS AGO BECAUSE BETTIS WAS INJURED IN THE PRESEASON. AND THEN DUCE STALEY, THEY HAD ACQUIRED, WAS INJURED. AND COACH COWHER SAID, &quot;WELL, LET'S GIVE THIS KID A TRY.&quot; AND HE SAID, &quot;THE MORE I SAW OF HIM, I SAID, 'YOU KNOW WHAT? I THINK WE MAY JUST HAVE OUR BEST PLAYER STARTING THE SEASON.'&quot; &gt;&gt; WELL, IT'S NOT A SURPRISE HOW QUICKLY PURE, RAW SPEED IMPRESSES A COACH. THEY LOVE SPEED. &gt;&gt; AND HE'S NOT THE TYPICAL BIG RUNNER THE STEELERS -- YOU SAW THOSE 1,000-YARD-PLUS RUSHERS ON THAT LAST GRAPHIC. WELL, SECOND DOWN AND LONG. AND ROETHLISBERGER WITH A PUMP, AND THEN HE'S GOING TO TAKE THE SACK. FUMBLES THE BALL! HE WAS WHISTLED DEAD. NO FUMBLE. THE PLAY HAD BEEN WHISTLED DEAD AT THE 39-YARD LINE. &gt;&gt; AND IS BEN HURT? BEN WAS STILL DOWN. OKAY, HE GOT UP LATE. &gt;&gt; REMEMBER, HE HAS THAT INJURED THUMB. HE WEARS A GLOVE, AS YOU CAN SEE, ON THE RIGHT HAND. IN FACT, HE LIKES IT. HE SAID EVEN WHEN HE'S NOT INJURED, HE MIGHT USE IT. HE HAS A SPLINT ON THAT RIGHT THUMB. &gt;&gt; AND HE'S SHAKING HIS RIGHT ARM. LET'S WATCH DWIGHT FREENEY. AS HE COMES AROUND, THEY GOT HEATH MILLER ON HIM. THEN, MARVEL SMITH PICKS HIM UP. BUT HE STILL, AFTER THE DOUBLE TEAM, GETS IN ON ROETHLISBERGER. &gt;&gt; BOY, IS HE INCESSANT. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN BEN GOES DOWN, OH, HE TAKES A SHOT. HE TAKES A SHOT FROM BEHIND RIGHT ON THE BACK OF HIS RIGHT ARM. AND BEN WAS SHAKING THAT ARM, TRYING TO SHAKE IT OFF. &gt;&gt; THIRD DOWN, 16. AND THE THROW INCOMPLETE. VERRON HAYNES WAS THE INTENDED RECEIVER, BUT THAT PASS THROWN UP INTO THE WEDGE THAT WAS FORMING ON THE SCREEN PASS. SO, THE STEELER DRIVE STALLS WITH PRESSURE ON ROETHLISBERGER AT THE 39 OF THE COLTS. &gt;&gt; YEAH, LET'S GO BACK A PLAY. WATCH AT THE VERY END. COMING FROM THE RIGHT, RIGHT THERE. OH, THAT IS A HELMET BY ROBERT MATHIS RIGHT ON THE BACK, RIGHT BETWEEN HIS ELBOW AND HIS SHOULDER, RIGHT IN THE TRICEP AREA. THAT'LL LEAVE A MARK. &gt;&gt; GARDOCKI, 1,162 PUNTS NOW WITHOUT A BLOCK. HE'S HAD SOME PARTIALLY BLOCKED THIS YEAR. JACKSONVILLE GOT A PIECE OF ONE IN A GAME AT PITTSBURGH, BUT NEVER TOTALLY SMOTHERED. &gt;&gt; YEAH, BUT IF IT'S BLOCKED, AND IT GOES A YARD OVER THE LINE, IT'S NOT A BLOCK. &gt;&gt; HIGH KICK. FAIR CATCH, TROY WALTERS. BEAUTIFUL SHOT OF THE CITY CIRCLE, DOWNTOWN INDIANAPOLIS, THE CAPITAL CITY OF THE HOOSIER STATE. INDOORS, THE RCA DOME, 55,000 EAGER TO FIND SOMETHING TO YELL ABOUT, AS THEIR COLTS ARE DOWN, 14-3. MANNING STARTS AT THE 9-YARD LINE ON THIS POSSESSION. THE PUMP. MANNING HAS TO RUN FOR HIS LIFE WITH HAMPTON CHASING HIM AND THEN THROWS IT AWAY. BIG, OLD CASEY HAMPTON, AT 325, TRACKING MANNING. &gt;&gt; LET'S GO BACK AND TAKE A LOOK AGAIN AT THAT HIT ON BEN ROETHLISBERGER. HE PULLS IT IN. HE'S UNDER THE CONTROL THERE OF FREENEY, BUT RIGHT THERE, FROM THE RIGHT, ROBERT MATHIS PUTS HIS HAT RIGHT ON TO THE BACK OF THE ARM. AND THEN DURING THE COMMERCIAL BREAK, THE MEDICAL STAFF OF THE STEELERS, THEY'RE TESTING BEN AND THE FEELING HE'S GOT IN HIS HAND. THEY WERE RUBBING THE BACK OF HIS ARM, BUT THAT CLEARLY WAS A LOOK AT TRYING TO SEE HOW HIS FEELING WAS IN HIS FINGERS. &gt;&gt; YOU SAW THAT GLOVE, MOLDED JUST PERFECTLY WITH A SPLINT TO PREVENT THAT CHIP THUMB FRACTURE THAT HE SUFFERED MIDSEASON. MARVIN HARRISON OVERTHROWN BY MANNING. AGAIN UNDER PRESSURE, MANNING. ARMEN, WHAT DO YOU HAVE FOR US? &gt;&gt; WELL, JUST TO ADD A LITTLE BIT, DAN, TO YOUR OBSERVATIONS, BEN HAS A HUGE WELT ON HIS TRICEP AREA IN THE BACK OF THAT RIGHT ARM. AND, AS YOU SAID, THE TEAM DOCTOR HAS KIND OF BEEN SCRATCHING RIGHT ABOVE THE WRIST AREA, TRYING TO SEE IF THERE'S SOME SENSATION THAT BEN CAN FEEL IN THAT RIGHT ARM. HE'S REALLY BEEN WORKING ON IT. WE'LL SEE HOW IT AFFECTS BEN WHEN HE COMES BACK OUT. BACK TO YOU. &gt;&gt; AND NONPLUSSED IS ROETHLISBERGER. HE DIDN'T WINCE AS THEY WERE WORKING ON HIM. SO, FROM THAT IMAGE, IT DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE SERIOUS. WE'LL SEE. SERIOUS NOW FOR MANNING. THIRD AND 10 DEEP IN HIS OWN END. HERE THEY COME. AND MANNING -- THAT'S A SAFETY! &gt;&gt; THAT'S A SAFETY. &gt;&gt; OH! &gt;&gt; THEY'RE GONNA PUT HIM AT THE 1. &gt;&gt; THEY GAVE HIM PROGRESS AT THE 1, AND THAT WAS GENEROUS AT BEST. JAMES FARRIOR WITH A CHARGE ON MANNING. &gt;&gt; IT'S WHERE YOU GET HIT, NOT WHERE YOU END UP. I THOUGHT HE ACTUALLY WAS AT THE GOAL LINE WHEN HE GOT HIT. BUT LET'S TAKE A GOOD LOOK AND BE DEFINITIVE ABOUT IT. NO, THAT'S A GOOD -- HIS FEET WERE IN THE FIELD OF PLAY WHEN HE FIRST GOT HIT. GIVE PETE MORELLI -- THAT'S A GOOD SPOT. NOW THAT I LOOK AT IT A SECOND TIME, THAT'S A GOOD SPOT BY PETE MORELLI. BUT OH, SO CLOSE. &gt;&gt; AND NOW HUNTER SMITH HAS TO KICK IN A 10-YARD SNAP FROM THE BACK OF HIS END ZONE. HE DRIVES IT OUT. THIS IS A GREAT RETURN OPPORTUNITY FOR ANTWAAN RANDLE EL, WHO HAD TWO SCORES THIS YEAR. AND HE'S ALL THE WAY TO THE 30-YARD LINE BEFORE JUSTIN SNOW, THE MAN WHO SNAPPED THE BALL, CAN MAKE THE TACKLE. EIGHT YEARS -- HE'S NEVER MISSED A GAME, PEYTON MANNING, AND ONLY FIVE TIMES HAS THE DEFENSE HELD HIM UNDER 50% PASSING. AND HE'S RIGHT AT THAT LEVEL AGAINST THE STEELERS TODAY. &gt;&gt; WELL, HOW CAN YOU HAVE A DRIVE WORSE THAN THAT? RUNNING FOR YOUR LIFE FROM CASEY HAMPTON, A SEVERE OVERTHROW, AND A SACK ALMOST FOR A SAFETY. &gt;&gt; AND THEN, ON THE PUNT RETURN, 30-YARD LINE FOR THE STEELERS. AND WILLIE PARKER, WHO GETS 10, ALMOST 11 YARDS, AS THE STEELERS INVADE THE 20-YARD LINE. SANDERS AND DOSS, THE TWO SAFETIES, WITH THE TACKLE. &gt;&gt; WHEN THE COLTS TRY TO GET OUT OF THEIR OWN END ZONE, THEY GET THE BALL AT THEIR 9-YARD LINE. NOBODY BOTHERS TO BLOCK NOSE TACKLE CASEY HAMPTON. THAT'S NOT DWIGHT FREENEY. THAT'S NOT L.C. GREENWOOD. THAT'S NOT JOE GREENE. THAT'S A RUN PLAYER. THAT IS A GUY WHOSE JOB IT IS TO STUFF THE RUN. AND YET YOU GET YOUR QUARTERBACK FLUSHED OUT OF THE POCKET. &gt;&gt; &quot;I HAD HIM.&quot; &gt;&gt; CASEY. &gt;&gt; HE HAD HIM. CASEY'S TELLING HIM. &quot;I WAS GONNA GET HIM.&quot; &gt;&gt; THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN CASEY'S FIRST SACK IN A LONG TIME. &gt;&gt; JEROME BETTIS NOW AT FULLBACK OR TAILBACK, AND HE GETS THE CALL. AND BETTIS, A BIG HOLE, FINALLY CHOPPED DOWN AT THE 13-YARD LINE. AND THE TERRIBLE TOWELS ARE OUT, AS WITH AN 11-POINT LEAD, THE STEELERS ARE DEEP IN COLTS TERRITORY. THAT'S JOHNNIE AND GLADYS BETTIS, THE MOTHER AND FATHER. JEROME TOLD US HE GETS THOSE QUICK FEET FROM HIS MOTHER, WHO LOVES TO DANCE. &gt;&gt; AND THEY HAVE NEVER MISSED A REGULAR-SEASON GAME THAT JEROME BETTIS HAS PLAYED SINCE HE CAME INTO THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE. &gt;&gt; ISN'T THAT SOMETHING? 200-PLUS GAMES. &gt;&gt; THAT IS BEYOND BELIEF. THEY ONLY HAVE EVER MISSED TWO PRESEASON GAMES -- ONE IN MEXICO AND I THINK ONE IN, LIKE, JAPAN. &gt;&gt; IT WAS JAPAN. BETTIS FALLING FORWARD TO THE 11-YARD LINE. THAT WON'T BE ENOUGH FOR THE FIRST DOWN. BRINGS UP THIRD DOWN. IS IT BETTIS' FINAL SEASON WITH THE STEELERS? THERE'S CONSIDERABLE SPECULATION ABOUT THAT. &gt;&gt; I DID THE SUGAR BOWL WHEN THIS YOUNG MAN WAS A SOPHOMORE AT NOTRE DAME. AND I REMEMBER ONE TIME, WHEN HE BROKE A 50-SOME-YARD RUN, RAN AWAY FROM THE DEFENSIVE BACKS. I TURNED TO FRANK GIFFORD, AND I MADE SOME COMMENT ABOUT &quot;DID YOU JUST SEE WHAT I SAW?&quot; AND LITTLE DID I KNOW HOW LONG I WAS GONNA CONTINUE TO KEEP SEEING HIM. &gt;&gt; WHAT A GREAT ATHLETE AND WHAT A GREAT PERSONALITY TO MATCH. AND HE'S UP THE MIDDLE. HE'S DOWN TO THE 1-YARD LINE. ALMOST A TOUCHDOWN FOR BETTIS, WHO IS THE CLOSER, AS HE DESCRIBES HIMSELF. HE HAD 52 YARDS LAST WEEK AGAINST CINCINNATI, 91 CAREER TOUCHDOWNS IN THE REGULAR SEASON. &gt;&gt; WELL, KUDOS TO THE GUYS UP FRONT. THAT IS GREAT BLOCKING. THAT'S OUTSTANDING BLOCKING. MIKE DOSS DOESN'T WRAP UP. HE JUST KIND OF GETS LUCKY. HE COMES IN LOW, AND, REALLY, BETTIS KIND OF TRIPS OVER HIM. BUT THAT WAS SUPERIOR BLOCKING UP FRONT. &gt;&gt; THEY SPOT THE KNEE DOWN AT THE 2, WHERE IT'LL BE FIRST AND GOAL. AND TIME-OUT HAS BEEN CALLED. IT DOES NOT LOOK GOOD FOR THE FAITHFUL OF THE INDIANAPOLIS COLTS WITH THE STEELERS, ANOTHER IMPRESSIVE DRIVE. AND IT'S THE BUS, JEROME BETTIS, WHO LINES UP AT TAILBACK. &gt;&gt; KREIDER AT FULLBACK -- A LOT OF BEEF. &gt;&gt; THE BUS -- STOPPED AT THE 1. DID HE FUMBLE THE BALL? NO, THEY'RE GONNA RULE IT DOWN. HE LOST THE BALL. THERE WAS A SCRAMBLE IN THE END ZONE, BUT IT'S RULED DOWN AT THE 1-YARD LINE. WHERE DO YOU TACKLE JEROME BETTIS? YOU LOOK AT THAT BODY. YOU HAVE TO AIM LOW IF YOU'RE A LITTLE GUY, AND THAT'S WHAT DOSS AND SANDERS HAVE DONE. &gt;&gt; AND YET HE IS SO THICK THROUGH THE LEGS THAT IF YOU DON'T GO SO LOW THAT YOU TAKE HIS LEGS AWAY FROM HIM, HE'S GONNA BREAK YOUR HELMET. THOSE THIGHS WILL SHATTER YOUR FACE MASK. LOOK AT THOSE THINGS. [ CROWD CHEERS ] &gt;&gt; THE BUS IS IN THE TOUCHDOWN GARAGE AGAIN! JEROME BETTIS WITH SOME PITTSBURGH FROSTING IN INDIANAPOLIS -- 20-3. &gt;&gt; AGAIN, HIS MOM AND DAD CELEBRATING. BILL COWHER SPITTING. STEELERS FOOTBALL. MUCH TO THE DISMAY OF EVERYONE WEARING BLUE. &gt;&gt; 30 YARDS IN 6 PLAYS AFTER THE PUNT RETURN BY RANDLE EL. &gt;&gt; THE GOOD NEWS IS, HE GETS UP IN THE AIR. THE BAD NEWS IS, HE LANDED ON SOMEBODY. &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S THE KIND OF GESTURE -- &quot;YOU BET. WE CAME HERE TO WIN, AND WE GOT THEM RIGHT WHERE WE WANT THEM.&quot; &gt;&gt; WELL, BECAUSE BILL COWHER -- NOT MANY COACHES IN THIS LEAGUE COULD TAKE THE AIR OUT OF THE FOOTBALL LIKE BILL COWHER. WE'RE GONNA SEE THE STEELER GROUND GAME. WE'RE GONNA SEE A WHOLE BUNCH OF IT EVERY TIME PITTSBURGH GETS THE BALL NOW. &gt;&gt; JEFF REED ADDS THE EXTRA POINT, AND IT'S 21-3. JEROME BETTIS WITH A PAYOFF FROM A YARD OUT ON A 6-PLAY, 30-YARD DRIVE THAT BOOSTS THE STEELER LEAD HERE LATE IN THE THIRD QUARTER, JUST 1:26 REMAINING IN THE THIRD PERIOD, TO 21-3. &gt;&gt; BUT, THEN AGAIN, YOU KNOW, TOUCHDOWN DRIVES, YOU CAN SEE A LOT OF THEM THAT START ON THE 30-YARD LINE. &gt;&gt; THAT SHORT FIELD IS A COACH'S DREAM. AND BETTIS, WHO HAS ACCEPTED HIS ROLE -- HE KNOWS THAT PARKER IS THE STARTER, WILL PLAY MOST OF THE GAMES. HE SAYS, &quot;HE CAN DO HIS WORK. I'LL PICK UP THE SPARES,&quot; A BOWLING TERM. HE'S A BIG -- ONCE BOWLED A 300 GAME. THIS IS DOMINIC RHODES, AND DOMINIC MAKES IT TO THE 29-YARD LINE. THE STEELERS SAID THERE WAS A FUMBLE ON THE PLAY. NOT SO SIGNALED BY THE OFFICIALS. &gt;&gt; I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYBODY RULE IT DOWN YET. &gt;&gt; MIKE LOGAN COMES OUT OF THE PILE WITH IT. AND THEY SAY HE WAS DOWN BY CONTACT. WHAT DOES PEYTON MANNING HAVE IN THAT RIGHT ARM NOW TO INSPIRE THE COLTS? SO FAR, 14 OUT OF 22 FOR ROETHLISBERGER, AND MANNING ONE INCOMPLETE PASS FROM .500 ON THE DAY. IT'S CHIDI IUWOMA, RESERVE DEFENSIVE BACK, SPECIAL TEAMER, INJURED ON THE KICK RETURN. THEY WERE 13-0 IN LATE NOVEMBER, LOOKING AT THE PERFECT SEASON. OF COURSE, THAT WAS THE TALK AROUND THE NATION, THE NFL. WOULD THEY BE THE LONG-FORGOTTEN UNBEATEN TEAM FOR AN ENTIRE SEASON, MATCHING THE MIAMI DOLPHINS? AND SAN DIEGO CHARGERS, A 3-4 DEFENSE, AND THEY PUT PRESSURE ON MANNING THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND DEFEATED THE COLTS, 26-17. AS DAN POINTED OUT EARLIER, THE STUDY OF THOSE TAPES BY ALL THE DEFENSIVE COORDINATORS AROUND THE LEAGUE MIGHT HAVE OPENED SOME OF THE SECRETS, AND THE STEELERS HAVE JUST OUTPLAYED THEM. HERE COMES PORTER. AND INCOMPLETE, THE PASS, INTENDED FOR BRYAN FLETCHER. &gt;&gt; YEAH. YOU KNOW, DICK, IT'S NOT SO MUCH A SECRET AS IT IS HOW TO GET IT DONE. I MEAN, IT'S ALL PRESSURE. PRESSURE IS THE SAME THING THAT DEFEATS EVERY QUARTERBACK. AND THE QUESTION IS, THIS OFFENSIVE LINE FROM INDIANAPOLIS HAS ALWAYS DONE SUCH A GOOD JOB. PEYTON DOES SUCH A GOOD JOB GETTING RID OF THE BALL IN A HURRY. PRESSURE IS NOT HEART. IT'S NOT EASY TO COME BY. AND YET NOW THE STEELERS ARE DOING IT, TOO. IT'S UNDENIABLE THAT THEY'RE GETTING IT DONE IN MANNING'S FACE. &gt;&gt; AND MEANWHILE, MARVIN HARRISON HAS ONLY ONE CATCH, THAT ONE-HANDED -- POLAMALU! THAT WAS SIMILAR TO THE MOVE HE MADE AGAINST CINCINNATI ON THE INTERCEPTION LAST WEEKEND IN THE SECOND HALF. &gt;&gt; OH, HE UNDERCUTS REGGIE WAYNE, AND, BOY, DOES HE LAY OUT FOR THIS FOOTBALL. LOOK AT THIS CLOSE BY TROY POLAMALU. SEE, HE'S AT THE SAFETY, BUT HE'S GONNA UNDERCUT WAYNE. THERE HE COMES UNDERNEATH, AND, MAN ALIVE, DOES HE LAY OUT FOR THAT THING. LOOK HOW CLOSE THAT WAS TO A PICK. THIS GUY HAS MORE ATHLETICISM IN HIS LITTLE FINGER THAN A LOT OF GUYS HAVE ALL OVER. HE IS SOMETHING ELSE. &gt;&gt; WELL, MANNING'S SAID HE'S NEVER SEEN ANYONE COVER SO MUCH GROUND AS A DEFENSIVE PLAYER AS POLAMALU. OUT OF THE BACKFIELD. EDGERRIN JAMES. TWISTS AWAY FROM HOPE AND ACROSS THE 35. BUT THAT LEAVES LITTLE HOPE -- FOURTH AND 2. &gt;&gt; YEAH, CHRIS HOPE, HE HUNG IN THERE. HE DIDN'T GET HIM CLEANLY THE FIRST TIME, BUT RATHER THAN FALL OFF, HE STAYED WITH HIM. AND THE CROWD HERE -- YOU KNOW, PEYTON MANNING WANTS TO GO FOR IT. HE'S SENDING THE PUNT TEAM OFF THE FIELD. [ CROWD CHEERS ] TONY DUNGY SENDS THE PUNT TEAM OUT. THEY'RE HALFWAY OUT THERE, AND PEYTON MANNING SHOOS THEM BACK. &gt;&gt; FOURTH AND 2. MANNING FEELS HE CAN GET THE FIRST DOWN. IF NOT, THIS GAME BASICALLY IS GONNA GRIND TO A HALT HERE LATE IN THE THIRD QUARTER. &gt;&gt; TONY'S SAYING, &quot;YOU TAKE OWNERSHIP OF IT.&quot; &gt;&gt; SO, THEY NEED 2 YARDS TO SPUR ANY HOPE HERE. AND LESS THAN THAT, IT'S THE STEELERS' BALL DEEP IN INDIANAPOLIS TERRITORY. QUICK THROW. COMPLETE. BRANDON STOKLEY HAS HIS FIRST CATCH OF THE GAME, AND HE'S CLOSE TO MIDFIELD AND A FIRST DOWN. THE GAMBLE PAID FOR MANNING AND THE COLTS. OH, MY! AND NOW THE FOURTH QUARTER OPENS WITH THE COLTS CONVERTING A GAMBLE ON FOURTH AND 2 DEEP IN THEIR OWN END -- A COMPLETED PASS TO BRANDON STOKLEY. SO, IT'S INDIANAPOLIS ON THEIR OWN 49, TRAILING THE STEELERS, 21-3. QUICK THROW TO REGGIE WAYNE, AND WAYNE GETS VERY LITTLE, AS JAMES FARRIOR READ THAT SLIP SCREEN. &gt;&gt; WELL, EVERYBODY TALKS ABOUT HOW FAST THE COLTS DEFENSE IS. I THINK THE STEELERS DEFENSE MIGHT HAVE READ MAYBE ONE STORY TOO MANY ABOUT THAT, 'CAUSE THEY'RE PUTTING ON A PRETTY GOOD DISPLAY OF THEIR OWN ABOUT HOW QUICKLY THEY CAN GET TO THE FOOTBALL. THEY ARE FLYING TO THE BALL WITH NOT JUST ONE GUY -- MULTIPLE TACKLERS GETTING THERE AT THE SAME TIME. &gt;&gt; SECOND DOWN AND 9. HERE COMES THE BLITZ. MANNING GOES. HAS A MAN OPEN. DALLAS CLARK, THE TIGHT END. SPINS BACK. 20, 10. CLARK. TOUCHDOWN! &gt;&gt; PEYTON MANNING, WAVING OFF THE PUNT TEAM, BUYS HIS TEAM A TOUCHDOWN. &gt;&gt; AND DALLAS CLARK, THE NUMBER-ONE PICK OUT OF IOWA A COUPLE YEARS AGO, A FARM KID FROM LIVERMORE, IOWA. PLAYED 8-MAN FOOTBALL IN THAT PART OF THE COUNTRY. &gt;&gt; WELL, FIRST OF ALL, THIS IS GREAT PASS PROTECTION. LOOK HOW PEYTON MANNING IS ABLE TO STEP UP INTO THE POCKET AGAINST THIS STEELERS' ZONE. DALLAS CLARK SITS DOWN, AND THEN YOU THINK DALLAS CLARK CAN'T RUN? YOU THINK THE GUY CAN'T COVER A LITTLE GROUND? HE RAN AWAY FROM THE STEELERS SECONDARY, INCLUDING POLAMALU. &gt;&gt; 14:09 LEFT IN THE FOURTH QUARTER. THE 50-YARD TOUCHDOWN PASS, MANNING TO DALLAS CLARK, AWAKENS THIS CROWD. IT'S 21-10, PITTSBURGH. AND NOW LET'S SEE WHAT TONY DUNGY'S DEFENSE CAN DO TO CHECK BEN ROETHLISBERGER AND THE STEELER &quot;O.&quot; CORTEZ, BIG, HIGH, SPINNING KICK DOWN TO THE 4-YARD LINE TO IKE TAYLOR. NO, IT'S RICARDO COLCLOUGH. AND COLCLOUGH OUT TO THE 26-YARD LINE ON HIS FIRST RETURN OF THE AFTERNOON. NOW IT'S UP TO THE DEFENSE OF THE COLTS TO MAINTAIN WHAT LITTLE MOMENTUM WAS BUILT BY THAT 50-YARD TOUCHDOWN PASS AND THE GAMBLE BY MANNING ON FOURTH AND 2 AT HIS OWN 36-YARD LINE. &gt;&gt; IF EVER TONY DUNGY COULD BESEECH HIS DEFENSE, AND RON MEEKS THERE MAKING THE CALL FOR A THREE-AND-OUT, THIS WOULD BE THE MAGICAL TIME TO DO IT. [ CROWD CHEERS ] &gt;&gt; AND THE CROWD SENSES JUST THAT. PARKER. BREAKS A TACKLE. AND PICKS UP 14 YARDS. BOB SANDERS WITH THE STOP. &gt;&gt; OH, AND MIKE DOSS HAD HIM. MIKE DOSS HAD HIM AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. THAT'S THE DEFENSE THAT YOU DIAL IT UP. YOU GOT YOUR STRONG SAFETY RIGHT THERE, AND HE JUST CAN'T WRAP HIM UP. MIKE DOSS JUST CAN'T BRING HIM DOWN, AND WILLIE PARKER, WITH THAT ELUSIVENESS. &gt;&gt; OFFICIALLY, A 13-YARD RUN BY PARKER, AND NOW HE HAS 53 IN THE GAME, AS YOU CAN SEE. RIGHT BACK TO PARKER. &gt;&gt; I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE THAT BILL COWHER WITH A LEAD JUST CONTINUES TO RUN THE FOOTBALL. IT'S SO OUT OF CHARACTER. [ BOTH LAUGH ] &gt;&gt; HE'S GONNA POUND IT AT YOU NOW. &gt;&gt; BILL COWHER LEARNED A LONG TIME AGO THE FUNDAMENTALS OF HOW TO HOLD A LEAD. HAVING THE OTHER TEAM'S OFFENSE ON THE SIDELINE IS A BIG PART OF IT. &gt;&gt; CLOCK RUNNING, UNDER 13:00 TO GO. 14 RUNS, ONLY 4 PASSES THIS HALF FOR PITTSBURGH. &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN THEY'RE RUNNING LIKE THIS, THIS IS WHEN BEN DOES THROW THE BALL. HE'S SO GOOD AT IT. HE CAN BE SO SELECTIVE. &gt;&gt; A RUN TO PARKER. HE JUST ACCELERATES SO QUICKLY ON THE TURN UPFIELD. MAKES IT TO THE 46, A LITTLE MORE. HE'S A COUPLE, 3 YARDS SHY OF A FIRST DOWN. BROCK AND HARPER MADE THE TACKLE. &gt;&gt; NINE AND COUNTING. &gt;&gt; PARKER OUT, BETTIS IN. KEN WHISENHUNT MAKING THE CALLS. THAT'S DICK HOAK, THE VETERAN COACH. BEEN WITH THE STEELERS FOR FOUR DECADES AS A PLAYER AND COACH. &gt;&gt; AND KEN WHISENHUNT, A GUY THAT IS -- HIS NAME'S IN PLAY. HE'S LIABLE TO END UP A HEAD COACH SOMEWHERE BEFORE NEXT SEASON GETS STARTED. &gt;&gt; THIRD AND 2. STEELERS ARE 6-FOR-9 ON THIRD DOWN TODAY. BETTIS. MAKE THAT -- WELL, IT'S GONNA BE CLOSE. THEY MAY HAVE TO MEASURE. THE SPOT IS RIGHT ON THE YARDSTICK. SIMON AND BRACKETT TEAMED UP ON THE TACKLE. &gt;&gt; WELL, IF YOU'RE LIKE ME, YOUR INITIAL THOUGHT WAS THAT JEROME BETTIS WASN'T GONNA BE CLOSE TO THIS. AND THEN HE GOT THAT SECOND DRIVE, AND HE GOT ABOUT A YARD FURTHER THAN I THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO. &gt;&gt; SEE TONY DUNGY SAY, &quot;IT'S CLOSE.&quot; SO, FIRST DOWN, STEELERS, OR FOURTH AND INCHES. &gt;&gt; LOOKS LIKE IT'S GONNA BE JUST INCHES SHORT. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE RIGHT. INCH, MAYBE. &gt;&gt; MAN. EAGLE EYES. &gt;&gt; GREAT ONES NEVER LOSE IT. THEY NEVER LOSE IT, THE GREAT ONES. &gt;&gt; [ Laughing ] YEAH. ESPECIALLY IF YOU NEVER HAD IT. &gt;&gt; SO, BILL COWHER -- &gt;&gt; LOOK AT THIS. BILL COWHER IS GONNA GO FOR IT. AT LEAST HE'S GONNA LINE UP LIKE IT. [ CROWD CHEERS ] I GUESS THAT LAST DRIVE OF THE COLTS -- THE WAY HIS DEFENSE HAVE BEEN THROTTLING THE COLTS BEFORE, I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT HE WOULDN'T PUNT THE BALL AWAY. THIS HAS TO BE BASED ON WHAT INDIANAPOLIS DID LAST DRIVE. &gt;&gt; AND INDIANAPOLIS JUMPS OFFSIDE, POINTING AT THE OFFENSIVE LINE OF THE STEELERS, BUT NO FLAG THROWN BY THE LINESMAN. &gt;&gt; THERE WAS CONTACT IN THERE, SO SOMEBODY'S GOT TO PAY. &gt;&gt; THE LINESMAN WHO CAME IN FROM THE FAR SIDE DIDN'T THROW A FLAG. HE JUST REACTED TO THE CONTACT ON THE PLAY. &gt;&gt; WELL, THEY HAVE TO DO SOMETHING. &gt;&gt; THERE'S NO FOUL ON THE PLAY. OFFENSE DID NOT MOVE. DEFENSE DID NOT COME ACROSS AND MAKE CONTACT. WE'LL REPLAY THE DOWN, FOURTH DOWN. &gt;&gt; NOBODY MADE CONTACT? BILL COWHER'S SAYING, &quot;THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.&quot; THEY'RE ENTIRE DEFENSIVE TEAM CAME ACROSS THE BALL. NOW SOMEBODY DID FLINCH. IT LOOKED LIKE SOMEBODY IN THE INTERIOR FLINCHED. PETE MORELLI IS SAYING THAT NO ONE FROM INDIANAPOLIS MADE CONTACT? &gt;&gt; WELL, THE NO-CALL MAY BE THE JUSTICE RULING. &gt;&gt; WELL, I JUST DIDN'T THINK -- I DIDN'T THINK A NO-CALL'S AN OPTION. NOW LET'S SEE IF THERE'S A TWITCH OVER THERE BY THE LEFT GUARD SOMEWHERE. OH, ALAN FANECA. ALAN FANECA DID TWITCH. THAT IS A FALSE START. WELL, PETE MORELLI JUST WANTS THIS PLAY TO GO AWAY. AND, BY THE WAY, A FALSE START, IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF REVIEW. IT'S NOT A CASE WHERE YOU GO UPSTAIRS AND DETERMINE THERE WAS A FALSE START. THAT'S OUTSIDE THE PARAMETERS OF REVIEW. &gt;&gt; ROETHLISBERGER AT 241, ALWAYS A THREAT TO SNEAK IN THIS SITUATION, AND HE DOES. HE'S STACKED UP AND ROLLS OFF THE PILE. AND LET'S SEE THE MARK. IT'S GONNA BE INTERESTING. &gt;&gt; WELL, IT LOOKED TO ME LIKE THE ONLY SURGE FORWARD THAT BEN GOT WAS WHEN HE GOT HIT FROM BEHIND BY JEROME BETTIS. &gt;&gt; THE BUS WITH A LITTLE BUMPER JOB, HUH? &gt;&gt; HE WAS PLAYING REGGIE BUSH THERE, I THINK. &gt;&gt; SHADES OF NOTRE DAME, UP TO THE NORTH OF OUR LOCATION. IT LOOKS AS IF HE DID ADVANCE THE BALL. &gt;&gt; THERE MUST BE SOMETHING ABOUT THIS BUILDING THAT MAKES BILL COWHER TAKE RISKS. REMEMBER WHEN HE STARTED THE SECOND HALF OF THAT MONDAY-NIGHT GAME WITH AN ONSIDE KICK AND DIDN'T GET IT AND GAVE INDIANAPOLIS GREAT FIELD POSITION, AND THEY SCORED? THIS IS OUT OF CHARACTER. &gt;&gt; YEAH, 21-10 LEAD. YOU HAVE 11 MINUTES LEFT IN THE GAME. AND HE TAKES THE RISK AND HAS THE REWARD. &gt;&gt; HE GOT THE REWARD. [ CROWD BOOS ] GIVE HIM CREDIT -- BILL. YOU GOT HIM. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. AT FIRST, BEN ISN'T GOING HARDLY ANYWHERE. HERE COMES JEROME BETTIS IN. [ Laughing ] HE HELPS GIVE BEN A LITTLE BIT OF A PUSH. TRYING TO GO RIGHT BEHIND KENDALL SIMMONS AND HARTINGS. AND THEN HE GETS A LITTLE HELP FROM BETTIS. AND HE GOT WHAT I THOUGHT IS A PRETTY DARN GOOD SPOT. &gt;&gt; YEAH, HE DID. SO, FIRST DOWN FOR THE STEELERS, AND BETTIS STAYS IN. AND ROETHLISBERGER WITH A THROW. INCOMPLETE. INTENDED FOR HINES WARD. COVERED BY NICK HARPER. HARPER'S PLAYED A SOLID GAME, CONSIDERING ALL HE'S GONE THROUGH IN THE LAST 24 HOURS. &gt;&gt; WELL, RIGHT NOW THE COLTS ARE PROTECTING A LEAD BUT FEELING A LITTLE VICTIMIZED, BECAUSE THAT LAST EXCHANGE RIGHT THERE, ALAN FANECA DID QUIVER AT LEFT GUARD. THAT WAS AN OFFENSE, AND IT WASN'T CALLED, AND THEN THEY WENT AHEAD AND SNUCK IT, AND THEY GOT ON THE SNEAK, AND THEY GOT THE FIRST DOWN. SO, THE COLTS RIGHT NOW DEFENSIVELY -- DON'T LOSE FOCUS JUST BECAUSE YOU'VE HAD A COUPLE BAD THINGS GO AGAINST YOU. &gt;&gt; BALL RIGHT IN THE EARHOLE OF THE HELMET PAINTED ON THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD, AND THE STEELERS, THAT'S KIND OF SYMBOLIC OF THE WAY THEY PLAYED TODAY. AND THERE'S ANOTHER BIG RUN BY BETTIS, POWERING HIS WAY DOWN TO THE 41-YARD LINE, CLOSE TO ANOTHER FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; THE GUY CAN STILL PLAY. I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF SPECULATION AS TO WHETHER THIS 13th YEAR IS GONNA BE THE LAST FOR JEROME BETTIS. NOW, OF COURSE, IT'S A LOT EASIER TO PLAY WHEN YOU'RE GETTING BLOCKING LIKE THAT -- JUST OUTSTANDING WORK. TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. ALAN FANECA AND HARTINGS, MARVEL SMITH, KENDALL SIMMONS, MAX STARKS -- THEY ARE REALLY ASSERTING THEMSELVES IN RUNNING THE BALL. AND PEYTON MANNING ONLY A SPECTATOR. AND I THINK THE FRUSTRATION SHOWS. &gt;&gt; THIRD DOWN AND A FOOT. BETTIS AND HAYNES NOW IN THE BACKFIELD. AND JEROME BETTIS. HIT AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. IT'LL BE CLOSE. IT APPEARS IT'S MARKED SHORT. THEY NEEDED TO CROSS THE 41, AND IT'S BEING SPOTTED OUTSIDE THE 41. REFEREE MORELLI CALLS FOR TIME AND A MEASUREMENT. &gt;&gt; I THINK IF THIS ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH FOR A FIRST DOWN, I THINK BILL HAS ALREADY DECLARED HIMSELF AS TO WHAT WE'LL SEE ON FOURTH DOWN. &gt;&gt; MARVIN HARRISON AND HIS PLAYOFF RECORD HAS BEEN STUNNING. AND IN FACT IT ISN'T REALLY THAT CLOSE AND ALMOST A FULL YARD FROM A FIRST DOWN. BUT HARRISON, WHO IS SUCH A DOMINANT WIDE RECEIVER AND PLAYER, SO PRODUCTIVE IN THIS OFFENSE, HAS ONLY ONE CATCH -- THAT CATCH EARLY IN THE GAME -- THE FIRST RECEPTION BY THE COLTS TODAY, ONE-HANDED FOR 24 YARDS. BUT IN HIS OTHER 4 PLAYOFF GAMES, HE'S BEEN WAY BELOW HIS SEASON AVERAGE, IN TERMS OF CATCHES, YARDS, AND TOUCHDOWNS. &gt;&gt; WELL, A MONSTROUS DOWN FOR INDIANAPOLIS AND THEIR DEFENSE RIGHT NOW. [ CROWD CHEERS ] &gt;&gt; MANNING WARMING UP, HOPING THAT HE'LL GET A CHANCE TO COME ON THE FIELD AFTER THIS PLAY. HE WANTS THE DEFENSE WITH A STOP. BETTIS LINES UP DEEP. JEROME PLOWS. OH, IT'S GONNA BE CLOSE. &gt;&gt; OH, I THINK HE GOT IT. &gt;&gt; THE LINESMAN ON THIS SIDE IS MARKING IT JUST OUTSIDE THE 40. AND THAT MIGHT BE GOOD ENOUGH. &gt;&gt; WHERE THE LINESMAN WAS INITIALLY RUNNING TO SPOT IT, IT SURE LOOKED LIKE IT WAS GOOD. &gt;&gt; THE TWO LINESMAN BOTH SPRINTING IN FROM THEIR POSITIONS. &gt;&gt; NOW WHERE THEY PUT THE BALL, IT'S BACK AWAY FROM THE 40 A LITTLE BIT. I THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE ABOUT A FOOT CLOSER. THIS IS GONNA BE TIGHT. &gt;&gt; IF HE MAKES IT, IT'LL BE TWO STRAIGHT FOURTH-AND-INCHES CONVERSIONS. WELL, THIS ONE WAS LONGER -- FOURTH AND A YARD. &gt;&gt; THEY GOT IT. &gt;&gt; THEY DID IT AGAIN. BY THE NOSE OF THE FOOTBALL. THAT'S LIKE A DAGGER TO PEYTON MANNING AND THE COLTS OFFENSE. AND THE CLOCK CLICKS AWAY TO 9:12. &gt;&gt; DEPENDS WHOSE OX IS BEING GORED. [ LAUGHS ] &gt;&gt; WELL...A THOUSAND WORDS. [ CROWD CHEERS ] &gt;&gt; WELL, RIGHT NOW A LOT OF CREDIT HAS TO BE HEAPED ON BILL COWHER. HE'S SHOWING A LOT OF GUMPTION ON THIS DRIVE. I THINK HE REALIZES THE COLTS MAY HAVE FINALLY GOT IT GOING ON OFFENSE. &gt;&gt; BETTIS STAYS IN. AND MET FIERCELY BY LITTLE NICK HARPER, 180 POUNDS, AND ANOTHER TACKLE FOR HIM. &gt;&gt; WELL, I'M NOT AN OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR, BUT IF THERE WAS EVER A TIME FOR A LITTLE PLAY-ACTION, WE'RE AT THAT MOMENT. THE COLTS ARE COMMITTING A LOT OF PEOPLE TO THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. &gt;&gt; SECOND TIGHT END, TUMAN, GOES OUT. A WIDE RECEIVER COMES IN. HINES WARD TO THE RIGHT, ANTWAAN RANDLE EL TO THE LEFT. HEATH MILLER THE TIGHT END ON THE RIGHT SIDE. BETTIS AND KREIDER BEHIND ROETHLISBERGER. &gt;&gt; EIGHT GUYS RIGHT THERE. HERE COMES THE NINTH. &gt;&gt; BETTIS AGAIN. WRESTLES HIS WAY TO THE 35-YARD LINE. DAVID THORNTON AND GARY BRACKETT, TWO LINEBACKERS, WITH THE STOP. IT'LL BE THIRD DOWN AND A SHORT 5. &gt;&gt; COLTS GOT 9 GUYS UP THERE CLOSE TO THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. WE GOT ANOTHER 2 GUYS OVER HERE TO THE RIGHT. AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, FOLKS. THEY'RE STILL HAMMERING AWAY FOR YARDS. [ CROWD CHEERS ] &gt;&gt; WILLIE PARKER IN NOW ON THIRD AND LONGER YARDAGE. ABOUT 4 1/2. SWEEP, PARKER. HIT IN THE BACKFIELD! RAHEEM BROCK THERE TO GREET HIM. SO, BROCK, THE VETERAN FROM TEMPLE, WITH THE DEFENSIVE STOP, AND FIELD-GOAL UNIT IS GONNA COME OUT. SO FAR, NO MOVE FROM THE STEELERS SIDELINE AS THE CLOCK CONTINUES TO TICK, AND THEY'RE GONNA SPEND AS MUCH AS THEY CAN. &gt;&gt; YOU'D BE LOOKING AT A 55-YARD FIELD GOAL. &gt;&gt; THE PUNTER COMES OUT. I DON'T THINK THAT'S AN OPTION, A 55-YARDER. &gt;&gt; GARDOCKI. &gt;&gt; IT REACHES A POINT WHERE THERE ARE JUST TOO MANY PEOPLE ON THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE TO RUN THE FOOTBALL, AND THE STEELERS REACHED THAT POINT. YET THEY WOULDN'T PUT IT IN THE AIR. [ WHISTLE BLOWS ] &gt;&gt; WELL, THEY USE THE ALLOTTED TIME BEFORE THEY ELECT TO KICK AND THEN SPEND THE TIME. THE CLOCK HAS STOPPED. DID THE STEELERS CALL TIME THERE? OR DELAY OF GAME. &gt;&gt; THERE'D BE NO REASON FOR THE STEELERS TO CALL TIME. THEY DON'T MIND GETTING BACKED UP 5 YARDS. &gt;&gt; THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN. 6:19 SHOWING ON THE GAME CLOCK. &gt;&gt; WE'LL ENFORCE A 5-YARD PENALTY FOR THE DELAY OF GAME. PLEASE SET THE GAME CLOCK TO 6:24. &gt;&gt; AND THEY ADD 5 SECONDS TO THE GAME CLOCK. SO, THAT APPARENTLY GOT AWAY, THE TIME COUNT ON DELAY OF GAME BY THE OFFICIAL IN CHARGE. SO, MORE PRESSURE HEAPED ON THE SHOULDERS OF PEYTON MANNING, WHO WILL BE 30 IN MARCH. &gt;&gt; DO YOU THINK THE STEELERS JUST RUNNING THE BALL, RUNNING OFF THE CLOCK -- THEY REALLY HAVEN'T TESTED MUCH OF ANYTHING SINCE BEN GOT HIT ON THE ARM. MAYBE THERE'S SOME RELUCTANCE ON THEIR PART TO THROW THE FOOTBALL. WE WON'T KNOW IT UNTIL WE SEE HIM TRY IT. &gt;&gt; GARDOCKI TRYING TO PIN THE COLTS DEEP. SENDS A BOOMER. SHOULD GO INTO THE END ZONE. IT DOES. &gt;&gt; HE ALMOST HAD IT. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE SITE OF THE NEW STADIUM THAT WILL BE -- WELL, IT'S UNDER CONSTRUCTION, THE FOUNDATION BEING LAID. THAT'S WHERE THE COLTS WILL BE PLAYING. NEW FACILITIES IN A COUPLE OF YEARS. MANNING DOWN THE MIDDLE. OPEN IS WAYNE. REGGIE WAYNE TO THE 44. [ CROWD CHEERS ] BRYANT McFADDEN MADE THE TACKLE, AN EXTRA DEFENSIVE BACK. &gt;&gt; AND THAT TIME, THE STEELERS CHOSE TO COVER RATHER THAN RUSH, AND THEY PAID FOR IT. PEYTON MANNING, LOTS OF TIME TO FIND REGGIE WAYNE. 24 YARDS ON THE PLAY. TIME OF ESSENCE -- 5:41, 5:40 LEFT IN THE FOURTH. &gt;&gt; PRESSURE'S WHAT'S BEEN WORKING FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; THEY RUSH 3 AGAIN. QUICK HITTER. INTERCEPTED BY POLAMALU, AND THEN HE FUMBLED AND RECOVERED HIS OWN FUMBLE. POLAMALU MAKES THE BIG PLAY AGAIN FOR PITTSBURGH! &gt;&gt; BOY, 3 MEN IN THE RUSH, 8 GUYS DROPPING BACK, AND TROY POLAMALU. NOW, I KNOW EVERYBODY IN INDIANAPOLIS WANTS TO KNOW, DID HE HAVE POSSESSION, WHEN YOU SAW THE BALL COME LOOSE LIKE THAT AT THE END. &gt;&gt; HE APPEARED TO MAKE A FOOTBALL MOVE, AND THEN IT JUST FELL OUT OF HIS HANDS. &gt;&gt; WELL, HE GOT BACK UP AND STARTED TO RUN. YOU'RE RIGHT, DICK. THERE IT IS, RIGHT THERE. HE HITS THE GROUND. OH, CLEARLY, HE MAKES A FOOTBALL MOVE. HE ROLLS OVER A COUPLE TIMES HOLDING THE BALL. &gt;&gt; POLAMALU HEADING WEST. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T GET MUCH MORE OF A DEFINITIVE LOOK THAN THAT. THE BALL FIRMLY IN HIS GRASP. RIGHT THERE, HIS LEFT KNEE BOOTS IT OUT OF HIS OWN ARM. AND ON THE FIELD, IT WAS CALLED AN INTERCEPTION. IF WHILE ROLLING OVER, THAT BALL WOULD HAVE BEEN LOOSE AT ALL, AUTOMATICALLY WE WOULD SAY NO, HE DIDN'T CATCH IT. &gt;&gt; AFTER REVIEWING THE PLAY, THE DEFENDER CAUGHT THE BALL, LOST IT PRIOR TO GETTING HIS KNEE OFF THE GROUND. THEREFORE, IT IS AN INCOMPLETE PASS. &gt;&gt; WOW. [ CROWD CHEERS ] WHOA. &gt;&gt; WHOA! &gt;&gt; WELL, THERE'S THE GUY WHO HAS THE ONLY OPINION THAT MATTERS. THERE'S THE GUY WHO HAS THE ONLY OPINION. SO, PETE MORELLI TELLING US HE'S BASING IT ON THE FACT THAT THE RIGHT KNEE OF TROY POLAMALU IS STILL ON THE GROUND WHEN THE BALL COMES OUT. RIGHT THERE. WOW, THAT'S... &gt;&gt; THAT'S INTERESTING, ISN'T IT? &gt;&gt; WELL, IT'S HIS OPINION, AND, AGAIN, THAT'S... IT'S A SURPRISE TO ME AND I THINK TO A LOT OF PEOPLE, BUT, HEY... &gt;&gt; HOPES ARE RESUSCITATED IN INDIANAPOLIS, AS THEY KEEP THE BALL AT THE 44. SECOND DOWN AND 10. PORTER UP ON THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE AND NOW FARRIOR. SO, A 5-MAN FRONT. AND THEY RUSH 5. POLAMALU HAD HIS HAND ON THAT ONE, AND CLARK ABLE TO MAKE THE CATCH. AND THE OMNIPRESENT POLAMALU ALMOST PICKED THAT ONE OFF. &gt;&gt; AND WE'VE GOT A GAME UNDER WAY. THERE IS STILL A LOT OF FOOTBALL HERE. &gt;&gt; 5:07, 5:06 LEFT IN THE FOURTH QUARTER. MANNING HURRYING HIS TEAM ALONG. UNDERNEATH. HARRISON, FINALLY. WHERE YOU BEEN? TO THE 27. TYRONE CARTER THE TACKLER. &gt;&gt; THE COLTS LOOK LIKE THEY'RE FINALLY PLAYING AND NOT THINKING. THIS IS JUST INSTINCT NOW, AND MAYBE THAT'S WHERE THEY'RE AT THEIR BEST. WORKING AGAINST THE SOFT ZONE OF THE STEELERS, LOTS OF ROOM UNDERNEATH FOR MARVIN. &gt;&gt; AND QUICKLY READY FOR THE NEXT CALL IS MANNING. DEEP TO WAYNE. OUT OF BOUNDS AT THE 1-YARD LINE! &gt;&gt; WHAT A CATCH! &gt;&gt; MAKE IT THE 3-YARD LINE. &gt;&gt; HOW ABOUT THAT CATCH BY REGGIE WAYNE? AND LOOK AT THE THROW -- RIGHT ON THE PALMS OF HIS HAND. OH, THAT'S NICE. &gt;&gt; BETWEEN THE TWO DEFENDERS, IT HAD TO BE PERFECT, THE THROW FROM MANNING, AND A COURAGEOUS CATCH BY WAYNE. FIRST AND GOAL AT THE 3. CLOCK DOWN TO 4:29. TIME-OUT WHEN YOU GO OUT OF BOUNDS UNDER 5 MINUTES. STOPS THE CLOCK. ALL 3 TIME-OUTS ARE LEFT ALSO FOR INDIANAPOLIS, IN CASE YOU WERE WONDERING. UP THE MIDDLE GOES EDGERRIN JAMES. HE'S IN THE END ZONE. TOUCHDOWN. &gt;&gt; ONE-POSSESSION GAME. WILL THEY GO FOR 2 HERE? GOT TO GO FOR 2 TO GET WITHIN A FIELD GOAL. GOT TO GO FOR 2 TO MAKE IT 18. FIELD GOAL WILL PUT IT INTO OVERTIME. &gt;&gt; TALK ABOUT A HIGH-OCTANE OFFENSE THAT DELIVERS QUICKLY. IN JUST A BIT OVER A MINUTE, THEY'RE ABLE TO SCORE AND PULL WITHIN 21-16. &gt;&gt; AND WHAT AN EFFORT THERE BY JAMES. HE'S HIT BY FARRIOR AT THE 2-YARD LINE AND STILL DRIVES INTO THE END ZONE. &gt;&gt; 1:39 -- THAT'S ALL IT TOOK FOR THE TOUCHDOWN AND OF COURSE THE CRITICAL OVERRULE ON THE FIELD ON THE POSSIBLE INTERCEPTION BY POLAMALU. NOW FOR THE 2-POINT PLAY. NOW A FALSE START. &gt;&gt; YEAH, THE CADENCE OF THE COLTS WAS WAY OUT OF SYNC THERE. &gt;&gt; ...OFFENSE. 5-YARD PENALTY -- REPEAT TRY. &gt;&gt; SOME QUARTERBACKS FEEL IT ISN'T THAT BAD A THING TO MOVE BACK 5 YARDS AND HAVE A LITTLE MORE TERRITORY. IF YOU'RE GONNA GO FOR THE 2, AND IT'S A PASS, YOU GOT A LITTLE MORE ROOM WITH WHICH TO WORK. WE'LL SEE. KIND OF TAKES THE RUN OUT OF THE OPTION. &gt;&gt; YEAH, ALL THINGS CONSIDERED, I'D RATHER HAVE THE 5 YARDS. &gt;&gt; SO, THE 80-YARD DRIVE AND 6 QUICK PLAYS HAS PRODUCED A TOUCHDOWN, AND NOW THE 2-POINT TRY TO TRY TO PULL WITHIN 3. [ CROWD CHEERS ] IT'S TO WAYNE. DID HE STAY IN BOUNDS? YES! &gt;&gt; MAGIC FEET. WHAT A JOB OF GETTING BOTH FEET DOWN BY REGGIE WAYNE. THIS THROW TAKES HIM CLEAR INTO THE CORNER. &gt;&gt; WELL, THIS DRAMA'S HAD SOME INCREDIBLE TWISTS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER -- THE FOURTH-AND-2 TRY DEEP IN HIS OWN END BY MANNING, THE INTERCEPTION, AND THEN NO INTERCEPTION, BY POLAMALU, THE QUICK STRIKE BY THE COLTS, NETTING THE 2-POINT PLAY. IT'S 21-18. CORTEZ KICKS IT OFF. IKE TAYLOR SETTLES AT THE 1. AND HE IS SMOTHERED AT THE 18-YARD LINE. NOW IT'S UP TO THE COLTS DEFENSE. &gt;&gt; WHAT A MAGNIFICENT PASS BY PEYTON MANNING, BUT THEN REGGIE WAYNE. LOOK AT THE FEET. THE RIGHT IS DOWN. HE DRAGS THE LEFT. HOW ABOUT LEAVING NO DOUBT THAT YOU'VE GOT THE LEFT FOOT DOWN? THE RUBBER CHIPS COME FLYING OUT OF THE FIELD TURF. OH, THAT IS BEAUTIFUL. GREAT, GREAT WORK, FOLKS. &gt;&gt; WAYNE, SUCH A COMPLEMENT TO HARRISON. ACTUALLY HAD MORE CATCHES IN THE REGULAR SEASON THAN HARRISON. WAYNE HAD 83 TO 82 FOR MARVIN. AND HE SHOWS HIS TREMENDOUS DEXTERITY ON THAT PLAY. NOW THE DEFENSE. &gt;&gt; WHO WOKE THIS CROWD UP? &gt;&gt; ROETHLISBERGER THROWS. INCOMPLETE. FLAG. IT'LL GO AGAINST THE DEFENDER, NICK HARPER, OVER THE BACK OF CEDRICK WILSON. &gt;&gt; PASS INTERFERENCE, NUMBER 25, DEFENSE. AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; WELL, YOU CAN SEE CEDRICK WILSON, NUMBER 80. HE'S DRIVING DOWNFIELD. JUST MAKES THE QUICK STOP, AND NICK HARPER JUST COMES THROUGH THE RECEIVER IN AN ATTEMPT TO GO TO THE FOOTBALL. &gt;&gt; THE RCA DOME, 55,000 FANS IN INDIANAPOLIS, THE NUMBER-ONE-SEED COLTS. BYE LAST WEEK, AGAINST THE STEELERS. THE STEELERS JUMPED TO A 21-3 LEAD, BUT THE COLTS ARE MUSTERING AN INCREDIBLE COMEBACK. IT'S TAKEN A SERIES OF BIZARRE EVENTS AT TIMES FOR IT ALL TO HAPPEN, BUT SUDDENLY WE'RE IN A 21-18 GAME, AS PEYTON MANNING'S OFFENSE REDUCING THE STEELER ADVANTAGE, ONCE 21-3 HERE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, TO 21-18. JEROME BETTIS HAS SCORED ONE OF THE PITTSBURGH TOUCHDOWNS. HE'S IN THE GAME -- ALMOST A STORYBOOK HERO IN THE STEEL CITY. THESE FANS, TO THE MAN AND WOMAN, ON THEIR FEET. THE WINNER MEETS DENVER NEXT SUNDAY IN THE AFC CHAMPIONSHIP GAME. SECOND AND 8. BETTIS. STOPPED AT THE 32-YARD LINE. COREY SIMON, THE EX-EAGLE NOSE TACKLE, MADE THE STOP. &gt;&gt; AND FOR A TEAM THAT HAS HAD SO MUCH SUCCESS EARLIER IN THIS GAME WITH BEN ROETHLISBERGER THROWING THE BALL, THEY HAVE REALLY GONE CONSERVATIVE, EXCLUSIVELY TO THE RUN. AND I DON'T KNOW HOW SEVERELY BEN HAS BEEN AFFECTED BY THAT HIT HE TOOK FROM ROBERT MATHIS. HE HAS COMPLETED A PASS SINCE. COMPLETED ONE TO HINES WARD. BUT IT'S ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY THE GROUND GAME. &gt;&gt; A HUGE THIRD DOWN AND 6. THE THROW DOWN THE MIDDLE. INCOMPLETE. HINES WARD, THE INTENDED RECEIVER. NICK HARPER MADE THE PLAY. [ CROWD CHEERS ] &gt;&gt; WELL, IF I'M GONNA THROW THAT PASS, I'M THROWING IT ON SECOND DOWN INSTEAD OF THIRD DOWN. AT LEAST HAVE THE ELEMENT OF SURPRISE OR PLAY-ACTION. NICK HARPER THAT TIME DIDN'T GO THROUGH THE BACK OF HINES WARD. HE CUTS IN FRONT, MAKES A PLAY ON THE FOOTBALL, LOOKING MORE LIKE THE RECEIVER THAN THE RECEIVER. &gt;&gt; PEYTON MANNING WILL GET A CHANCE AGAIN. PLENTY OF TIME NOW -- 2:42 AND ALL 3 TIME-OUTS FOR THE COLTS, WHO ARE GOING TO GET THE BALL. CHRIS GARDOCKI TO PUNT IT. TROY WALTERS CAMPED AT THE 22. BOOMING, HIGH SPIRAL. WALTERS HAS TO EAT IT AT THE 17-YARD LINE. &gt;&gt; AND HE WAS LUCKY NOBODY WAS ON TOP OF HIM. TROY WALTERS MUFFS THE PUNT. HAS IT GO RIGHT THROUGH HIS HANDS. LUCKILY IT HITS THE TURF AND COMES RIGHT BACK TO HIM, AND NOBODY FROM PITTSBURGH WAS REASONABLY CLOSE. &gt;&gt; IN HIS EIGHT MARVELOUS SEASONS AS THE INDIANAPOLIS QUARTERBACK, HE HAS ENGINEERED 25 GAME-WINNING FOURTH-QUARTER OR OVERTIME DRIVES TO VICTORY, NONE IN THE POSTSEASON. AND HE'S GOT A LONG WAY TO GO. HE STARTS AT THE 18-YARD LINE TO MATCH THE NUMBER ON HIS JERSEY. BETTIS FRUSTRATED BY NOT BEING ABLE TO PICK UP THE FIRST DOWN RUNNING. BY NOT RUSHING THE WAY THEY SENT FIVE, SIX, AND SEVEN MEN AGAINST MANNING EARLY IN THE GAME, THEY'VE ALLOWED MANNING PLENTY OF TIME TO SEEK OUT AN OPEN RECEIVER. LET'S SEE IF THEY PUT MORE PRESSURE ON HERE. THEY COME WITH MORE. A CORNERBACK BLITZ. THEY GET THERE. HE THROWS, AND JAMES ABLE TO GET 3 YARDS OUT OF WHAT LOOKED TO BE A VERY DANGEROUS PLAY. &gt;&gt; WELL, WHAT A JOB BY PEYTON MANNING OF STAYING ALIVE. THAT'S WHERE IT HELPS TO BE A BIG GUY. AND AT ALMOST 6'6&quot;, PEYTON MANNING IS A BIG GUY. HE'S GOT STEELERS HANGING ON HIM, AND YET HE NOT JUST DUMPS IT AWAY, BUT HE MAKES A COMPLETION. &gt;&gt; YOUNG ROETHLISBERGER, AGE 23, IN HIS SECOND SEASON, WATCHING MANNING, WHO HAS BEEN THE MOST VALUABLE PLAYER IN THIS LEAGUE 2 OF THE LAST 3 YEARS, A TOP CANDIDATE THIS YEAR. AND THERE'S THE 2:00 TIME-OUT. SIX TEAMS REMAIN IN THE SUPER BOWL DERBY. CHICAGO AND CAROLINA PLAY LATER TODAY. THIS TO ARRIVE AT THE AFC CHAMPIONSHIP GAME AGAINST DENVER. SECOND DOWN, 8, INDIANAPOLIS AT THEIR OWN 20. BLITZ. AND THEY GET TO HIM. JOEY PORTER OFF THE CORNER. PORTER WITH 10 1/2 SACKS THIS YEAR, A PRO BOWLER AGAIN 3 STRAIGHT YEARS, AND HAD A CLEAN SHOT. RODE MANNING DOWN AT THE 12-YARD LINE. &gt;&gt; IT HAS BEEN YOUR THEME FROM THE BEGINNING OF THIS GAME. PRESSURE MANNING. JOEY PORTER'S GONNA COME FROM THE LEFT. THERE HE COMES FROM THE LEFT OF YOUR SCREEN UNBLOCKED, UNACCOUNTED FOR. STEELER PRESSURE HAS BEEN THE DIFFERENCE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT WORKED IN THE FIRST HALF. DEEP DOWN THE MIDDLE. NO GOOD. BRANDON STOKLEY WAS THE TARGET. AND NOW IT'S FOURTH DOWN WITH 1:27 TO GO, AND MANNING, WHO HAD TO GAMBLE AND FORCED THE PUNTING TEAM OFF THE FIELD SENT OUT BY COACH DUNGY ON FOURTH AND 2 AT HIS OWN 36 EARLIER IN THIS QUARTER, WHEN IT WAS 21-10, AND IT WORKED. HE GOT A FIRST DOWN AND EVENTUALLY A TOUCHDOWN. BUT NOW, WITH ALL THE STAKES SO HIGH, HE'S GOT TO MAKE A PASS GOOD FOR 17 YARDS FOR A FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; AND THE STEELERS KNOW WHAT'S AT STAKE AS THEY GATHER OVER ON THEIR SIDELINE. [ CROWD CHEERS ] DO THEY RUSH 3 AND DROP 8, OR DO THEY BRING HEAT AGAIN? &gt;&gt; NOW OR NEVER. &gt;&gt; HERE COMES HEAT. &gt;&gt; POLAMALU. AND THEY GET HIM AT THE 2-YARD LINE! AND THE STEELERS, THE JUBILANT SIDELINE, AND BILL COWHER'S TEAM CAME UP WITH THE BIG PLAY AGAIN. IT WORKED EARLY IN THE GAME. HE CALLED OFF THE BLITZBURGH IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GAME AND THE MANNING-LED COLTS RALLIED, AND NOW, UNDER PRESSURE, THEY WENT BACK TO THE ORIGINAL GAME PLAN, AND IT'S GOING TO SPELL OUT A STEELER VICTORY. &gt;&gt; AGAIN, TROY POLAMALU UP THE MIDDLE, BUT THERE'S JOEY PORTER ONE MORE TIME OFF THE EDGE UNBLOCKED. JAMES FARRIOR IN THERE, AS WELL, AND A DEFENSIVE GAME PLAN PUT TOGETHER BY BILL COWHER AND DICK LeBEAU WORKS TO PERFECTION, AS THEY HOUNDED AND CHASED AND DROPPED PEYTON MANNING ALL DAY LONG. THERE'S DICK LeBEAU. THE DEFENSE SAYS HELLO TO THE OFFENSE. LOOK AT THAT. &gt;&gt; VETERAN LeBEAU TOLD US YESTERDAY. HE SAID, &quot;YOU THINK I'M EVER GONNA CALL THEM OFF? THAT'S MY GAME. I GOT TO ATTACK, BE AGGRESSIVE.&quot; BLITZBURGH WORKS IN INDIANAPOLIS ON THIS AFTERNOON, AND THE BALL AT THE 2-YARD LINE. PITTSBURGH, FIRST AND GOAL. &gt;&gt; THERE'S 3 TIME-OUTS HERE LEFT FOR THE COLTS. SO, THEY GOT TO KEEP THEM OUT OF THE END ZONE. &gt;&gt; BETTIS FUMBLED THE BALL! PICKED UP BY NICK HARPER! OH, MY! HARPER WITH ROETHLISBERGER TO BEAT! ROETHLISBERGER MAKES THE TACKLE AT THE 43-YARD LINE. CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS?! &gt;&gt; NO, I CAN'T! &gt;&gt; AND BEN ROETHLISBERGER SAVED THE GAME FOR THE STEELERS. &gt;&gt; AND THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WERE OUT THE DOOR WHO ARE STREAMING BACK TO THEIR SEATS. &gt;&gt; AND WHAT A GAME FOR NICK HARPER. FOR THOSE OF YOU JUST JOINING US, YESTERDAY IN A DOMESTIC SCUFFLE, HE SUFFERED A 3-STITCH WOUND IN HIS RIGHT THIGH, AND HERE HE IS, PLAYING THE GAME OF HIS LIFE. AND THE TACKLE BY GARY BRACKETT DISLODGES THE BALL FROM BETTIS, AND HERE'S HARPER. &gt;&gt; WELL, BRACKETT PUTS HIS HELMET RIGHT ON THE FOOTBALL. AND, REALLY, IT WAS BEN ROETHLISBERGER WITH A SENSATIONAL EFFORT. JEROME BETTIS WENT IN HIGH. HE WAS RUNNING STRAIGHT UP, EXPOSING THE BALL. AND BRACKETT PUT A HAT RIGHT ON IT. BUT THAT'S A TOUCHDOWN IF NOT FOR ROETHLISBERGER'S HUSTLE. &gt;&gt; INDIANAPOLIS STILL HAS ALL 3 TIME-OUTS. 1:09 LEFT. FIELD GOAL TO TIE, THANKS TO THAT 2-POINT CONVERSION. HERE COMES PORTER AGAIN. MANNING STEPS UP AND HITS WAYNE. AND WAYNE WITH A FIRST DOWN AT THE 36 OF PITTSBURGH. ALMOST IN FIELD-GOAL RANGE. &gt;&gt; WELL, THERE'S TONS OF TIME WITH ALL 3 TIME-OUTS. PEYTON MANNING CAN BE DELIBERATE HERE. HE CAN USE ALL THE FIELD. BETTER TO BE RIGHT. THAT'S RIGHT. CALL OUT THE PROTECTION. &gt;&gt; CLOCK TICKS TO 42, 41. OVER THE MIDDLE. COMPLETE TO HARRISON. HARRISON RIDDEN DOWN BY IKE TAYLOR INSIDE THE 30-YARD LINE. 32, 31. THEY HAVE 3 TIME-OUTS, AND THEY'LL SPEND ONE RIGHT NOW. STOPS THE CLOCK AT 31 SECONDS. AND BILL COWHER AND THE STEELER FAITHFUL TOTALLY STUNNED BY THE AFFAIRS HERE, WHEN IT APPEARED THEY HAD IT WON ON THE 2-YARD LINE. ALL THEY NEEDED WAS TO RUN OUT THE CLOCK. BUT BECAUSE INDIANAPOLIS HAD THE 3 TIME-OUTS, THEY HAD TO GO AT IT SERIOUSLY. &gt;&gt; AND GARY BRACKETT JUST SQUARES UP AND PUTS THE CROWN OF HIS HELMET RIGHT ON THE FOOTBALL AND THE RIGHT ARM OF JEROME BETTIS. JEROME DID NOT HAVE A LOT OF BODY LEAN. THE BALL WAS EXPOSED. AND BEN ROETHLISBERGER... &gt;&gt; HE WAS THE LAST JERSEY. &gt;&gt; ...OH, HE MAKES A GREAT PLAY. HE REALLY MADE A REAL ATHLETIC MOVE. AND RIGHT NOW, TOMMY MADDOX TALKING TO JEROME, SAYING, &quot;LOOK. WE COULD BE HEADED INTO OVERTIME. WE STILL MAY NEED YOU.&quot; &gt;&gt; &quot;DON'T DIG YOURSELF DOWN TOO DEEP EMOTIONALLY.&quot; BALL AT THE 33-YARD LINE. IT'D BE ABOUT A 50-YARD FIELD GOAL IF THE COLTS DON'T GAIN ANOTHER YARD. &gt;&gt; I THINK MIKE VANDERJAGT WOULD APPRECIATE A FEW MORE YARDS. &gt;&gt; OH, YOU BET. MANNING'S GOING FOR IT ALL TO WAYNE. INCOMPLETE. ROOKIE BRYANT McFADDEN WITH THE COVERAGE. &gt;&gt; WHOA-HO-HO! TALK ABOUT A ROOKIE HAVING TO STEP UP TO THE BIG TIME. TONY'S LOOKING FOR PASS INTERFERENCE. BOY, THE ROOK IS OUT THERE FOR A BIG-TIME PLAY. NO WAY DO YOU CALL INTERFERENCE ON THAT. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T. &gt;&gt; NO. HE'S PLAYING THE FOOTBALL. HE'S GOT GREAT POSITION. &gt;&gt; WAYNE HAD A COUPLE OF CHANCES TO GET -- OH, AND JUGGLED AND OFF THE CHEST OF WAYNE, REMINDFUL OF THE GAME 10 YEARS AGO IN PITTSBURGH, WHEN HARBAUGH THREW THE BALL INTO THE END ZONE ON THE LAST PLAY OF THE GAME, AND IT BOUNCED OFF THE RECEIVER'S CHEST, AND PITTSBURGH WON. &gt;&gt; NEED A NEW SET OF DOWNS HERE. &gt;&gt; THE THROW. ALMOST INTERCEPTED. REGGIE WAYNE WASN'T NEAR THE BALL, AND BRYANT McFADDEN WAS. &gt;&gt; BOY, YOU MIGHT HAVE JUST BEEN BETTER OFF TO JUST PICK UP A COUPLE YARDS AND MOVE THE CHAINS, TAKE A TIME-OUT, AND STILL TRY TO GET SOME YARDAGE. NOW WE'RE GONNA HAVE A LONG FIELD GOAL. &gt;&gt; YEAH, THEY WENT ON SECOND AND FOR THE TOUCHDOWN. AND THEN, THIRD AND 2, THAT PLAY. AND NOW THE PRESSURE ON VANDERJAGT, THE MOST ACCURATE KICKER IN THE HISTORY OF THE NFL, MAKING 87.5%. BUT HE DOESN'T HAVE TO KICK A LOT OF THEM LIKE THIS, UNDER THIS PRESSURE. IT'S 46 YARDS TO TIE. AND PITTSBURGH WILL CALL A TIME-OUT. PEYTON MANNING IN THE PLAY-CALLING THERE WAS A BIT SURPRISING. THEY DID NOT BUY MORE YARDAGE FOR VANDERJAGT, WHO NOW MUST KICK THIS 46-YARD FIELD GOAL TO TIE. AND IT'S NO GOOD! &gt;&gt; HE MISSED IT. &gt;&gt; NOT EVEN CLOSE. WIDE RIGHT. &gt;&gt; THAT IS A SHOCK. MIKE VANDERJAGT HAS BEEN MONEY OVER THE YEARS FOR THE COLTS. THERE'S A LATE FLAG THAT JUST GOT THROWN. I MEAN, JUST GOT THROWN RIGHT NOW. AND I THINK IT'S MAYBE REMOVING YOUR HELMET IN THE FIELD OF PLAY. &gt;&gt; UNSPORTSMANLIKE CONDUCT, NUMBER 13. 15-YARD PENALTY -- AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; BOY, THAT NEVER HAD A CHANCE. &gt;&gt; NEVER EVEN GOT CLOSE. INCREDULOUSLY, TONY DUNGY SAID, &quot;HE MISSED IT.&quot; &quot;CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?&quot; SAYS BILL COWHER. &gt;&gt; AND A REPRIEVE FOR THE BUS, AS WELL. &gt;&gt; THE HAPPIEST MAN IN AMERICA, JEROME BETTIS. MAYBE HE IS DESTINED TO GET TO DETROIT THIS YEAR. &gt;&gt; &quot;HE MISSED IT,&quot; SAYS PEYTON MANNING, TRYING TO SWALLOW THAT SMILE. HE DID SO MUCH TO RALLY HIS TEAM, AND IT DOES COME DOWN TO THE KICKER, AND VANDERJAGT IN TODAY'S NEWSPAPER IN INDIANAPOLIS TALKING ABOUT EVERYONE SAYING, &quot;WELL, IT'S THE EASIEST JOB IN FOOTBALL -- PLACEKICKER. ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS GO OUT THERE AND KICK IT THROUGH THOSE POSTS.&quot; AND HE SAYS, &quot;YEAH, IT'S EASY UNTIL THE GAME'S ON THE LINE,&quot; ALMOST PREDICTING HIS FATE TODAY. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. WELL, THE ONE THING ABOUT IT, THAT'S NOT ONE OF THOSE FIELD GOALS THAT JUST BOUNCED OFF THE UPRIGHT. BILL AND JEROME, THEY'VE BEEN TO A FEW RODEOS TOGETHER, HAVEN'T THEY? &gt;&gt; 17 SECONDS AND THE TIME-OUT -- WAS IT CALLED BY INDIANAPOLIS? THEY STILL HAVE TWO REMAINING. &gt;&gt; WELL, GIVEN THE FACT FROM WHAT WE SAW DOWN ON THE GOAL LINE, ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN. &gt;&gt; JUST ANOTHER COUPLE KNEEL-DOWNS FOR BEN ROETHLISBERGER. A GAME THAT HAD SUCH HUGE TIDAL SWINGS OF EMOTION. [ LAUGHS ] &gt;&gt; WIPE THAT BROW, JEROME. [ LAUGHS ] &gt;&gt; 14-0, AN OMNIPOTENT START BY THE STEELERS. THEY JUST TOOK THE BALL DOWN THE FIELD AT INDIANAPOLIS AND ALMOST AT WILL TOOK THE 14-0 LEAD EARLY. AND THEN, WITH A SIZABLE LEAD, BUILT FROM 14-3 TO 21-3, THEY PLAYED CONSERVATIVELY. THEY DIDN'T RUSH MANNING. MANNING WAS ABLE TO FIND OPEN RECEIVERS FINALLY, WHEN GIVEN THAT MUCH TIME. THEY RALLIED TO 21-18, AND THEN, WITH A CHANCE ON THE BETTIS FUMBLE TO AT LEAST SECURE A TIE, BUT VANDERJAGT WIDE RIGHT FROM 46. AND ANOTHER KNEEL-DOWN, AND THE FINAL TIME-OUT CALLED BY INDIANAPOLIS. &gt;&gt; WELL, TWO THINGS JUMP OUT AT ME. ONE IS HOW EFFECTIVE BEN ROETHLISBERGER WAS THROWING THE FOOTBALL EARLY IN THIS CONTEST -- UP AND DOWN THE FIELD. THOSE FIRST TWO DRIVES, BEN WAS JUST ON FIRE. HE COULDN'T MISS. AND SECONDLY WAS THE PRESSURE THAT THE PITTSBURGH DEFENSE WAS ABLE TO BRING CONSISTENTLY ALL GAME LONG ON PEYTON MANNING. THEY INDEED TOOK THE BLUEPRINT FROM THE CHARGERS AND APPLIED IT HERE AND APPLIED IT FOR A WIN. &gt;&gt; AND EARN A TRIP FOR THE AFC CHAMPIONSHIP AGAINST THE DENVER BRONCOS IN THE MILE-HIGH CITY NEXT SUNDAY. AND IT'LL BE THE FIRST TIME EVER, DAN, THAT A NUMBER-6 SEED, THE LAST SEED, HAS BEEN ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY WIN THE FIRST TWO GAMES IN THE PLAYOFF ROUND AND GET TO THE CHAMPIONSHIP GAME. &gt;&gt; AND HOW HAPPY ARE THE FANS IN DENVER THAT THEY ARE GONNA HOST THE AFC CHAMPIONSHIP GAME?
