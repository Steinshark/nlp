(laughing) - [Bounty Hunter] It says There's the Kia Soul! - [Karl] Wait where? - [Karl] He's hiding in the warehouse! - I'll watch! - [Chris] Should we ask - Why is there a safe here? - [Chris] Is he in the safe? - Hey, bounty hunter! Can you hear me? - Yeah. - Welcome to my safe. This is one of the most secure - What the heck? - I bought it from a bank. (laughing) You're probably wondering, 'How are you gonna get in so I don't know, figure it out. - All right, if I know Jimmy. (metal music starts) - Nice! - I'm scared. - [Jimmy] What the boys there was a secret tunnel under the safe, and Tariq and I escaped out and ran for the U-Haul truck I planted earlier that day. And just when we thought we were home free - Did we leave the 100k in the safe? - [Jimmy] Oh God! Can you go back? - Yeah, I can go back. - [Jimmy] Yeah, go get God speed! - Is he still in there? - I don't know. He hasn't said anything. - Check the back. - Oh, there's a way out. - We gotta get around the back. Come on! - Jimmy, promise me to That was so scary. - [Jimmy] And now we're off I wonder if they've caught on yet. - Wait, did he get out - That's how he got out. - Where'd he go? - He went out through that gate. - If we go through this way, - Guys, get in here! - He left the computer. Let's see what it played. (computer audio starts) - [Jimmy] Cause, um, and nerds aren't gonna catch me. - Was he ever here?! (X-Files intro music plays) - By now they had to have caught on that we're no longer in the vault. Honestly, they have to be pretty close. So, Tariq hurry up! - [Bounty Hunter] Guys, That tracker says that he's left. - Hey, Jimmy! - That seemed like a nice - Wait, he used a different car? - Go, go, go, go. - [Tariq] That's the - [Jimmy] Get out the way grandma, I got a bounty hunter on me! - [Tariq] All right, park - We're now at the movie theater, come on! And we don't need masks because we've rented the entire place. Read the name of that, what does that say? Here, zoom in on that. - [Tariq] Observation, oh! - [Jimmy] Go, go, go, go, go! - [Tariq] Was that them? (bell dings) - Tariq, look back here. There's a secret door! All right, and now we are sealed off. - This is ridiculous. Have you ever had to chase - Just the other day, man, over fences, chasing a guy, but we got him just like we're gonna get Jimmy. It looks like he might be It says that he's in the U-Haul. - [Karl] Is he in the U-Haul? - Any luck in the back? - I'm gonna try to break the locks open. This is awkward, If it's not our truck. - Yeah, there's just a lot of chicken. It's so hot in here. - All right guys, the U-Haul's and no-go. Real quick, before we go in there, let's check the tracker and - It still says we're right on top of him. - Come on. - Nothing! Where did he go? - Did you hear that? - Oh, God. - Dude, how does he keep disappearing right from underneath us? - Carl smells. - Wait, what? - This one's like lighting up! - Wait, something's playing. - Wait, this looks like Oh no, this is, - This is him leaving the island! - Oh yeah, I'm on this video. - No, no! - That's so embarrassing! - Check roof? Guys, come here. - [Bounty Hunter] The - They just checked this room, and since I wasn't in this room, they now think I'm on the roof. But what they didn't think of is instead of being above it, I'm below it. - He rented out a whole movie theater just to hide on the roof? - This man's insane. - I need this money, let's go, hurry up! - I'm coming! - JIMMY! - I have access to the security cameras of the movie theater on my phone. I can see that they're currently upstairs. So now's our time to go. - All right, I gotcha. - I think he got us again. - Hey look, we got a Let's see what we can see. - That camera looks suspicious. - Let's go take a look at it. But then I think we He's definitely watching us. That cord leads us back down. Guys we gotta focus, - Right over here's an exit door. And according to the Earlier today, I called and they disconnected this fire alarm. So you know what that means. (clicks) Let's go! (fire alarm sounds) - Shoot, we gotta go. - We gotta get back to the car. - Where the fire alarm's coming from? - The fire's coming! - Yo, that was perfect timing! That wasn't insane. I bet they're freaking out right now. According to the security down the stairs. So we do have But no matter what we need to be fast 'cause all it takes is one slip up and I lose a hundred thousand dollars. And if you thought what we just did in the movie theater was cool, let's just say that - Go, go, go, go! - Dude. It's personal for me now. I want you to win. He did that island stunt, come on. - Turn the AC on! It's hot! - I don't think he knows - We decided to get in - [Bounty Hunter] Welcome We're right on him, we're within a mile. - It's personal. - We are now going into a I have a ride waiting; I missed. So that bar is stopping them from driving their car back here. And they're not gonna be - [Bounty Hunter] Looks that got ditched. The doors are open and everything. - I'm calling Chris. - We're pulling up right now. There's like a car with the doors open, I, of course you left the doors open. - So you see the car with the doors open. That was my car, correct? - How many Kias did you buy? - Your ATV's over there! That was a lie, they don't have one! - [Bounty Hunter] Ah, he was right there! - [Jimmy] And now we book it! (fast paced music plays) - My legs, sir. - We're going the right way. - Do you have the 100k? (grunts) This is the key to it. You see the key to the ATV? Bye! - [Tariq] Oh, it's gone. - The reason we had to ditch the ATV is cause of these train tracks. We're out of the woods. They're right on our tail. - Yeah, yeah. He definitely - [Jimmy] We gotta go - [Tariq] You're joking. - [Jimmy] The sun was It was so hot! We passed by some people to sell me his hat for $10,000 so I could cool off. Pretty good deal if you ask me. As you guys can see, we We also have a bunch of porta-potties. And you might be wondering and a bunch of porta-potties? It's a diversion! They're gonna be expecting me to be inside one of these porta-potties. But what they don't know, behind that Bush is actually another car. I hid this bad boy last night. - All right we're right on his tail. GPS has got him, we're about to catch him. We just gotta get through this field. - It's almost like this is your job, dude. How are you not tired? - Oh, I'm exhausted, but Does anyone see him? - I don't see him. - I'm gonna give the pilot - Oh my God, there's a helicopter. (helicopter engine revs) - He's in the porta-potty! What? - [Chris] Wait, he's in the porta-potty! Let's go. (intense music plays) - [Jimmy] They're gonna think Look at that helicopter!

Karl I'm in the porta-potty, HELP! - You're in the freaking - Isn't that kind of unsafe? - I just hung up, so he thinks - He just hung up. - Oh no! - Do they actually think - [Tariq] Probably, honestly. - They should be able to tell hidden in the woods. - [Bounty Hunter] The Doesn't have him moving. - It's your call. - I think he's still We gotta check all the porta-potties. What is that? - That's a Mustang. Is that Jimmy? - Ah, later nerds! - [Bounty Hunter] Oh, that's Jimmy. - [Karl] What? There he goes. - Oh my gosh. Yo, that was so close. Chris almost had us! - We've gotta be more stealthy. We've gotta use the woods. We've gotta blend in with or he is gonna get away again. - [Jimmy] We've been in a random field with a but this next location isn't as weird. We're going to a mansion. Not my mansion. I rented it. I don't have tens of millions of dollars And here's the mansion we rented. Follow me, Tariq. And I know for a fact, the We left them in the middle Me and Tariq are gonna rest We have security cameras and we can see exactly when they pull in. - [Bounty Hunter] All right, we're not gonna park right We're gonna park a little - All right, that sounds stealthy. - All right guys, take a look. If we look at this, it's to one of these three corner houses. Yeah, I got it. - I can see him, yeah. Yeah. Do you see the, you of the Mustang right there, - Literally all I'm doing is just staring at these security cams. The second I see them I'm booking it for the boat. - [Chris] Oh my God. This is like a palace! - Oh, they're coming, they're Go, go, go Tariq, go, go, They're running so fast. - Is that him?

We'll take whatever road - Okay. - The plane is we go to the Then I buy a car off of - [Tariq] Wait, you're - Yes. And then we go back from the tag video where I have hundreds of mannequins set up and I'm gonna hide amongst them. And then after that, we're gonna go to a hotel - Good news guys. Even though he left on the boat the GPS is still tracking him. So I've got a good point on him still. We're about to be right on top of him. He's right under this bridge - What do we do when - We're gonna jump off - We traveled all down and we're at another dock. We gotta be inconspicuous because the boys could be here waiting. I don't know where they are. You're the guy I talked to on the phone? - Yeah. Hey Jimmy, how you doing? - We agreed to 20,000 on the phone. - Uh huh. - Here you go.

(screaming) - [Jimmy] I wanna play this As you can see, Chris hugged me. What do you do when one is just hugging you for dear life? I didn't wanna hurt him. So I had no choice, but to and then let the bounty hunter catch up and steal the money from me! (kazoo blowing) (cash register opening) - Yes, we did it! Hey, great tackle! - Yes! You said we should tackle - That was perfect. - Congratulations on the hundred grand. (cash register opening) - Thank you Thank you so much! - I'm a little salty, you won it fair and square.
