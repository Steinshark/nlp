- All right, let's dream together. Welcome aboard this brand spanking new, I mean, not even finished (intense music) (suspenseful music) (intense music) (suspenseful music) (upbeat music) (upbeat music) (upbeat music) (suspenseful music) Welcome aboard, steel hull We filmed an Ocean King at the Cannes Yachting Festival And this one is completely different and still super, super cool. So cannot wait to show unique features, crazy cool engine room. I mean, there's a lot. - [Rico] Yeah, well, there's - Yeah. - [Rico] It's very large. And like Victoria mentioned to the finish line when 'cause of course the boat will before the boat show. Usually it is right the - Never works that way. It just doesn't, so. - [Rico] Yeah. Anyway, so we are- - Let's start. - [Rico] On the aft deck, main deck aft. - Yes. - [Rico] Which is a complete I mean, it's all loose furniture here and it's very unique in terms because it's not just it could be a pool, because we heard hull number in this space. - Like a 5.3 meter pool. How many feet is that? Almost a 20-foot pool. - [Rico] Yeah, like of the deck right now here. So in this case, it functions and also as a tender storage. - Yes. So immediately off the bat, we have a feature that is so unique and I don't know if you So here we are. We can put a tender here, - [Rico] Yeah, how do we get it here? - That is what everyone's going to ask. But real quick before we get - [Rico] Yes. - These are so cool. The way it has been built in into It looks really slick. - [Rico] Of course we have Our capstan here, our Of course, everything neatly which are coming over And it's open underneath again. So if you sit here on the furniture, you actually have the view - Yeah, and you also have the breeze, which gets completely enclosed, can get pretty hot back here at anchor because the wind is always - [Rico] Yep. - So, and one feature before we miss it later to feed your line all the So I think come down- - [Rico] Yeah, it actually comes out on the inside of the bulwarks there. But the way this is designed, you would be able to still and without shaving on the - Yeah, and often we kind of see it here, but this is really cool and How about that crane? - [Rico] Yeah, how about that crane? - Okay, I'll let you do it since you're so excited about this. - So it's pretty cool the Of course, if you know, you know, and you see the base of - [Victoria] Rico immediately knew, he just walked up onto the boat within the first three seconds. He was like, oh, that's a crane. - That's a crane. So the way they did it, they and bolted it to the top of the crane. We have an LED strip right here. So for crane operation, you because wherever the that's where your light goes. Just perfectly done. And then it rests in this cradle here, just perfectly how it lines up. And if you don't know, and especially from the - [Victoria] If you - Now you know, from the it just looks exactly the - [Victoria] Yeah, it's- - That's pretty cool. - [Victoria] Really well done. - So the capacity of 1,500 kilograms is about 3000 pounds. So 3000 pounds, you can lift I mean easily a 20, potentially 25-foot rib onto the deck here and have the removable cradles and yeah, I mean it's a great spot. - Our friends at Ocean King were so kind, they actually offered So we can give you guys a quick demo of what that looks like. - Okay. (upbeat music) That is just so cool. And you see the LED lights now in there, so if that would be on, you light everything up Can I have the shade, - [Victoria] Yeah, you can hang. - Perfect, perfect. - [Victoria] You can hang like - Yeah, maybe I should just- - [Victoria] No, like like a shade umbrella. - Yeah, yeah. - [Victoria] And put it - All good, all good. (laughs) Yeah. Grazie - This whole area is of course It is loose furniture. You can set it up any way you like. We are gonna look at when we're touring the salon. So don't look at it just yet I mean, all the way. - [Rico] Let's do it. - No peeking. Just all the way up. (gentle music) All the way up to our sun deck. Ah. - [Rico] Oh wow, can I jump in here? - No. - [Rico] Okay, starting forward. - I don't think anyone's allowed to jump into the jacuzzi tub and the owner hasn't of this vessel, so I don't I would be pretty upset if before I was in my jacuzzi. - [Rico] Okay, makes sense. - Okay, so we're in a top deck, sun deck, the interior design, and of course some exterior So the owner brought his and when you see the styling, a lot of it was obviously designed and inspired by that designer. So some stuff is definitely and comes from say more of like a luxury home. So this is gonna be an interesting tour. Okay, as we mentioned, this yacht is still in They rush to get it to the show, there's gonna go to Monaco with that are still not a One of them is cushions. They didn't have time to It was so quick. So you'll see cushions missing. So obviously you have imagination. You can see that all very comfortable plush cushions. - [Rico] Hull number two actually will have an exterior helm right here. So flybridge helm, second helm station. - Interesting. - [Rico] So it can be customized, however you would like to use it. I mean I probably would really like to have - How does it work with these hatches? There are two openings. I kind of wanna open one. - Okay. - [Victoria] Do they just come up? Do you just lift them? Oh, they come out completely. - [Rico] Oh wow, that's huge. - [Victoria] And you just lift them. Yeah, that goes all the way in there. - Yeah. - [Victoria] So this whole space is all giant massive storage where you'll probably put covers. - And then what we learned like I mentioned, there's and then there is a staircase down here which drops you right So the captain can easily just climb up, and take control up here and or go back down if he wants I think it's a really cool idea. I would love that actually. - Great. Check out this bar. - [Rico] You look like a - What do you mean? - [Rico] The bar is so tall, the ceiling. Look at the, can you touch the ceiling? - No, no, absolutely not. It's gotta be over- - [Rico] It's crazy. - It's gotta be, I don't So it's gotta be over seven, - [Rico] So this is every - Yeah, I mean I'm but I have no idea. Like this whole boat is so tall. Look how tall this bar is. - [Rico] Yeah. Oh wow. - The countertops are super tall. Yeah, I mean this family's Ice maker. We have a short cycle dishwasher, like a two-minute dishwasher. Fantastic to have here. Everything is stainless steel. Very unusual. The doors, look at this. All stainless steel. - [Rico] Wow. - There is a wine cooler in here. See what I'm saying? Commissioning still happening. - [Rico] Yep, yep, yep. - This is stainless steel. Yeah, I've never seen that before. We have an electric grill here. All of these finishes, they're all solid, natural, untreated teak, He really wanted that look. And that's what they went with. - [Rico] You missed the door there. - Oh my god. - [Rico] Wow, what's that? - Look at this door. - [Rico] Oh my god. - Wow. - [Rico] So we got some breakers in here and then just extra storage to have on the top deck because - Okay, what's behind the other door? - [Rico] Door number two. Ah, okay, I see. So we have a day ahead so you don't have to go - Every single deck has a day head. It was one of the requests and they were able to accommodate that. This door is- - [Rico] Those doors are- - I mean, ridiculous. It's definitely overkill on the day head. Keep going. So all of this is storage. I promised Rico I'm gonna because I did not get yesterday. It was a really long tour. It took us two hours So I will try my very best to be good. So here we do have our jetted hot tub. What's this for, Rico? - [Rico] This is a drain. - In case the water spills over. - [Rico] Yeah, in case the - I think so. - [Rico] Yeah, I guess when since the boat is not rolling that much, but it has the forward, the pitching movement and then gets trapped there. That's my- - Interesting. - [Rico] That's my guess. - Massive layout cushion here. Very nice spot to get This whole area is glassed of course there's an opening in between. It's triple. - [Rico] Triple. - Triple. Yeah, that's- - [Rico] Triple glass. - Very serious. - [Rico] We have receptacles also, we saw them over there. - So you can shade this whole area. - [Rico] You can create over this area, which keeps Love the flagpole. That's a really massive flagpole actually. And then looking up there, our mast, got our domes and of course our VHF radios and antennas. - Going one deck down. - [Rico] Yep. (gentle music) - [Rico] Welcome to the bridge deck aft, which is another entertaining space. - This space is unique to Ocean King. There was a space like that we filmed with them and it had the same convertible idea and I think they're nailing it. It's really cool. We're gonna show it to you real quick. In this space, again, all the furniture and all the exterior It could be completely transformed And when we just did a Rico had his own ideas of what - Yeah, I think I would move and then right here kind of in between, this is a perfect spot Put the mixer here, CDJs We can then have speakers even up here and subwoofers down there. And this would be the (upbeat music) The perfect spot to play. (upbeat music) And then what do you think? I mean we can easily fit a - [Victoria] A hundred. - Oh yeah, very easy. - [Victoria] I'm gonna and tarot now yet to have - Now let's think about this too. We have a crane here, right? So we can use the crane to or something. - [Victoria] A person - Or a person. - [Victoria] Some tissue art. - Yes. So I think- - [Victoria] And airless. - I think we're well equipped for it. - Amazing. I would like to say that - [Rico] Oh, the headrest. - Very cool. Yeah, just so comfy kind of. - [Rico] Yeah. - A fan. I like these a lot. - [Rico] So this could be I mean it could be any furniture you think you wanna put here. Now moving forward, actually are we going outside forward all the - Oh, you think? - [Rico] I think so. - Oh. - [Rico] Usually do the - Okay, I guess, well, I - [Rico] Off to the side deck. - Yes. - [Rico] And all the way forward. - Check out these side decks. They are so wide, extra wide. - [Rico] That is really, really wide. - Definitely excel. - [Rico] Yeah. - Don't peek in here then. - [Rico] No, not peeking. - They just go forward quickly. - [Rico] So then we have for visibility. Very nice, big stainless steel rail. - Your wing station is here and that's- - Well, the wing station is there. The spot to stand as you guys can see, the bulwarks actually came back in, made a lot more narrow and So, but if you stand I can literally see the aft for docking purposes. Very, very nicely done. We have our pilot house weather tight door. And then let's look at - [Victoria] Hmm. - There we go. This just flips over. - [Victoria] Oh that just goes flat. - So now I could stand use my controls right here, and our stern thruster here as well as a joystick for the rudder. So rudder, bow thruster, stern thruster, shift and throttle control, And then of course emergency Nicely tucked away. And there's, it's gasketed So it keeps it dry even in heavy seas. - Forward, all the way forward, we have a very comfortable sitting area. Again, cushions are coming in, they're just not, they - [Rico] And it's a high low table. - Very nice. So you can most likely if you wanted to. This is gonna be a massive layout spot. Look how big it is once it's closed, but it's open right now, so - [Rico] So just wanna mention this quick. You look at the overhang, and how wide the overhang is forward. And then we have the which I like and Victoria likes as well. That keeps the pilot and also minimize glare. - Exactly. But Ocean King's history is That's where they come from. And they just excel in engine room. So we'll show to you guys in a moment, but this is one of the features that they just carry that they have with - [Rico] Okay, looking further forward, we do have a hydraulic hatch here with another crane in there and of course additional storage space. - So there are three - [Rico] Yes, we haven't - Exactly. So there's another one coming, but that's a bit unusual as to have three cranes. - [Rico] Yes. All right, and then all the way forward, of course we have our typical suspects, we have our two windless Our bollards right there. Our small, but big - Yeah, it's definitely a crew space for them just to be able work in, I would say this - [Rico] No, it's not. And then of course we have the hatch here to get into the anchor locker. - And I'm a little bit - [Rico] No bell. - No bell. - There's no bell. - [Rico] The bell must be somewhere. - There's no bell. - [Rico] Bell has to be somewhere. So let's go back aft. - Okay. - [Rico] And check out the (upbeat music) (upbeat music) - You cheated. (Rico laughs) You cheated. - [Rico] Maybe. - Come on. - [Rico] Maybe. - Okay, you know how you can have like a dining table there. You don't have to have because your al fresco dining is here and it's a convertible dining space. So these massive sliding this space completely. And you have this gorgeous views that you have on this deck. Well, if you close them up, no breeze. - [Rico] No, no. If you open them up, you have, I feel the breeze right now here. It just feels so nice. - He wasn't listening to - [Rico] Yeah. - But when they're open- - [Rico] Almost 10 years married. - Oh, it is a full al fresco dining. He just tunes me out. I do the same. There are times I do the same. Talk about this table - [Rico] This is such a cool design with the base of the table. - Yeah, look at that leg. - [Rico] It seems like a wave. - Exactly. - [Rico] Like a wave out of, It's just really beautiful. It's two of these. So the glass just sits on top and then it's anchored to the ground. But very cool. - Yeah, I mean when you see you know this is a that they felt comfortable. The interior designer And they said, yeah, that this glass table is gonna So this space has another hidden feature. This is a lot of little surprises. - [Rico] Yep. - You guys ready for this? - [Rico] I am. - So we are, remember there was a day head here and there's gotta be a day - [Rico] Well, we haven't - Well, there's a TV here when in need. - [Rico] Oh wow, this whole thing opens. - It's a door. - [Rico] Check this out. - That is probably the coolest on a yacht. - [Rico] It's so well done. - Wait, wait. Come in. How does it look when you close it? Can we hear anything? Because you know, people Oh, it's so quiet. So quiet in here. It's incredible. I didn't lock it. What's here? Panels. Come on. - [Rico] Oh, storage. - Oh, check this out. - [Rico] Yep. - All right, so we have a Let's keep exploring. This door is just crazy. - [Rico] What a mechanism, huh? - Wow.

No. - [Victoria] Fhiaba. - [Rico] Fhiaba. - [Victoria] Fhiaba. - [Rico] Oh, Fhiaba. - [Victoria] Fhiaba. - [Rico] It looks to me - But like, I don't know, Well, I mean, based on the galley, it's completely commercial. You guys will see it. Yes, I'm not surprised. Again, another quick cycle like whoever was inputting or potential designer just pushed for this and said, hey, we gotta Makes all the difference. So, look how amazing. Huge sink here. Storage underneath. So nice. It's brand up. It's like- - [Rico] What I've never seen before is an induction plate - Oh, to be able to - [Rico] Maybe, yeah. - Potentially. - [Rico] Maybe just to do - Well, think about it. If you're doing, for example, And you're just doing simple eggs. - [Rico] Yeah. - For the guests. - [Rico] Don't need to - Why would you do it in the galley? You can just have, it's very simple here. Omelets, whatever. And you can actually have like that's not coming up the stairs. - [Rico] Which totally makes sense. I mean this staircase It goes down to the galley and then all the way down - Exactly. - [Rico] But yeah, this makes total sense. The table is right here. - There's a massive Very big. And of course storage in the space and some more looks like pantry. Oh no, that's our pantry. - [Rico] We have a breakup panel here for the upper deck into the pilot house. - Okay, pilot house.

We have an ice maker of course, to be able to bring in into the galley. Massive wine cooler here. Looks like we have storage here as well. So yeah, I guess it's for the galley. An extension of the pantry. There's another breaker panel here. - [Rico] Yep, same spot like I think it's always in the same spot. Kind of makes it super easy.

And we'll show you the Let's go here first. Check out the size of the crew cabins. The floor space is what I always look at. So look, two bunk beds, you have deep storage, you know, shelves there that you can Nice little area there to put And then of course they and lots of space like this is good. Very generous.

The lighting in here is incredible, right? Wow. - You guys just saw the whole boat. Again, 40-meter is a big And the amount of space and this size of an engine Like huge props to the naval engineering and technical space people We've toured many boats of this size. - [Rico] Yeah. - And this is not a normal thing to have this kind of an engine room. - [Rico] Yeah, it's a really Start on the port side, we have fresh water pumps. Then we have the day tank here with the fuel polishing Turning around, we see the muffler here from the main engine, which And then it goes just over here. But the accessibility is fantastic. I mean everything can be on the transmission, on the PTOs, shaft all the way down there. We have tons of access hatches instead of having to Anything I need to reach, any with a hinge attached to it. So you can just flip it In this case here we right underneath there. Moving further to the center, we have our stabilizer Huge electrical panel right Another burning monitor here Shore power controls are right here. We have the two main of the engine room with of the best accesses to the I mean you can go 360 degrees around, and service your generators. That makes it, well, that makes the engineer Same with the main engines, I Dipsticks, oil filters, whatever it is, I have a really, really easy access to it. Moving further over- - I think the, it's not gonna be an issue for this yacht 'cause it's just, anybody would be happy to work here. - [Rico] Yeah, and it's really well lit. There's no shading any kind of way. Then moving further over we have some more pumps down here. We have a little bit of a work Then here on the starboard with the hatch overhead Right next to that, we have and then two chiller units on top, which are extremely quiet. Very impressed by it actually. You don't hear anything. Unbelievable. Air conditioner is cranking right now. Moving further after muffler separators, for the generator exhaust, we have a nighttime smaller Also fantastic accessibility of the blackwater treatment And then here on the aft actually a mobile fire extinguisher. And of course we have a for the main engine room right overhead. - Let's go check out the beach club. (gentle music) I did not expect this. - [Rico] Oh wow. - At all.

(laughs) And then there's still a No, that's not a technical area. - [Rico] Yep, it is. - It is. - [Rico] Yeah. - Oh. - So we have our shore frequency converter, some storage. And then all behind these as well as here. For example, here we have, again, technical space right here. We have our cable rear emergency steering is right here. And then we have more hydraulic units, I believe for maybe the I'm not a hundred percent sure. We have our emergency fire pump.
