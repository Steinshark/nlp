He's putting the tarantula. I'm gonna get you, kid. Come get this off of me, spider. Please don't bite me. I would not want that on my face. I'm gonna get you, you little brat. No, you're not.

I won't hurt you. I tied the sheet so we Aria. Aria. Aria. Oh, no. Her brother went the wrong way. That's exactly where the robber is. This isn't good. The other robber's coming up the stairs. They're closing in on him. I got you now, little kid. I already called the cops. Well, tell them to bring an ambulance. Cause you're gonna need one. Aria, your brother's in trouble. You need to help him. Grab a broom. Bailey. Good night, Buncher. Hey, where'd that broom come from? We did it. We got to the robber. Arya, you guys protected the house. You did it. We've been looking for you two. You're going to prison for a long time. Wet Bandits. Come on. Are you kidding me? And I beat the level. You are going into Red Riding Hood I can do this Now. I'm in Red Riding Hood and Oh, no. What happened? The werewolf ate my sister. Did you see it happen? Her hat. No, but there have been reports of the She was just here. Werewolf hare. I blamed the witch. I'll put a spell on you. Can I please have a word with her alone? Look, I can help you figure I just need to know about everyone here. Well, there's the priest, Father Solomon. He has a suspicious past. He's also a witch hunter. The blacksmith is recently single and one The little girl is a local but is always watching everyone. We've tried to cast the witch out of There's a witch hunter and a witch. We need to keep those Two apart. And I'm the woodcutter, If all of you are human, it's gonna be hard to figure out Not quite. Here's a moonstone. Its powers can reveal who the werewolf is. But it can only be touched once. Thank you... Hey, Zamfam. I only have one guess to figure so I have to get it right. It looks like the werewolf has good aim. So I think I have a challenge. This is the tomato launching challenge. Each of you will use the slingshot. To try to hit the target. Why are we doing this? We all know it was the witch. She was the only one I was asleep. She was the one that was outside. I wouldn't kill my sister. What about the little girl? I'm innocent. It was the witch. Free not. Blacksmith, you are up first. Take your best shot. Close, but you did not hit the A little too much speed there, Blacksmith. Woodcutter, you're up next. Not bad, but a little bit low. Witch, you're up next. Remember, whoever is the werewolf has perfect aim. Which means they'd hit Just as I suspected. She's the werewolf. I'm done with this challenge. Come on. The challenge isn't over. Little girl, you're up next. The priest just ran off when he got angry. Just like a werewolf would Do you think he might be the werewolf? Okay, I've got this. I think we are done with that challenge. The priest hasn't gone. You're right. We need to figure out if he. Might be the werewolf. Witch. I need you to apologize to him I'll go find him. Who wants to hold this slingshot for him? Not me. The priest. It had to have been the witch. He's right. She was the only one alone with him. If I wanted to kill him, There is still a werewolf here. Now I'm gonna figure out who it is. All of you, head that way. Whoever did this must have I just need to look and see It looks like there's green Zamfam, Was he poisoned? Anything else? What's this? A letter... Meet me at 6. I miss you. Zamfam. Do you think this note has anything I need to focus on the clues I have. And I think. I think I know the next challenge. This is the Don't Knock the cup challenge. Each of you will do a somersault Woodcutter, you're up first. Looks like you knocked over a few. Not terrible, but not great. Next up, we have the blacksmith. That was not so graceful. I don't know. I usually do better at things like this. Next up, we have our little girl. Do your best. Look, and you weren't good at this challenge. You're not the werewolf. You can go home. Faith, you should go. It's not safe for a little girl. He's right, witch. Do your somersault. Congratulations, witch. You are the only one that That's because she's the werewolf. I'm just good at balancing Or killing my sister. Funny how you keep blaming I have another challenge left. I need all of you to head that way. I am pretty confident it is But I want to do one more challenge, if I don't get it right, I know your sister wouldn't approve. Approve of what? Mind your business, werewolf. Are you guys ready for the next challenge? Witch, you're up. I'm going to throw this ball, and you have to try to Impressive, woodcutter. Maybe I made this too easy. And finally, we have our blacksmith. I'm not sure I fully understand Trust me. I am going to find the werewolf. All three of you caught it. I think I have enough You know who the werewolf is? I do. You are undeniably the best But I can only make one guess And so I believe that the werewolf is you, blacksmith. Wh. Why me? You lost the tomato challenge not but because your aim was too high. Just like it was too high when you hitting her in the cup challenge, you knocked over the cups not because but because you were distracted And finally, you caught the ball, Was it because the belt I work long days? Or because you're a werewolf and silver makes a werewolf weak? No, this can't be true. You poisoned the priest because he found Because you two have been Nobody saw any of this happen. I saw you guys holding hands. And so did I. But I put it all together when the didn't approve of your relationship. And that was her sister, Put your hand on the moonstone. Fine. It was me.
