Not good control but good shot. -Oh, the touch is there. STAY TUNED!!! So, let's go. Today we are in Barcelona with Alexia Putellas. -How are you doing? OK, beautiful. And today, I'm not alone. I'm joined by the tallest referee in the world. There he is, Michiel!!! -Good luck, good luck today. -Can I stand in the middle? Thank you very much. And you two have online a very big challenge on the Matchday app. But today it's an offline challenge. OK, let's go. Celine against Alexia. -You are ready? How many Ballon D'or did you win? -2. I know, but it was better for you to say it yourself. So 2. And you? -Zero? Today, you can prove all the haters wrong. Yeah, let's go. Wait a minute. I'm also not alone. I need someone for the assists. And I have a very good one. Let's go! Oh, look at him. -I'm ready. Let's go, guys. He's taking it serious. I normally don't pass in a match, so it's going to be tough for me to assist. -We only need passes today. Uh, anybody else? No, no. I'll be fine. First, we have a little warm-up. Billy! -That is 1. OK. I'm the worst at this game. Oh, referee. -Oh, referee. -One, one, one. Referee is too good. I'm the referee. If you say I do something!!! No, no. No. 1, 1, 1. Let's go. That's 2. Come on. Come on. Let's punish you to start the video. I can't do it. -I can't do it to Celine. -They are too nice. Now it's time for the real deal. All right. Challenge number one. You hit the crossbar, you get a point. First attempt. Come on, Alexia. -Off. The ball is soft. Oh, the balls are soft. -Please!! No, I didn't touch before the ball. Alexia, this was a tactic. OK. -Be careful, it's soft. Yeah, come on! Yeah! -Thank you. Come on. Yeah, yeah, yeah! -Too strong. No, me. I'm so strong! You are too strong, OK. I saw you were shooting before I arrived. -Yeah, we had a warming up. -True. Too strong. I feel you. -Alexia, final attempt. If you miss this one, Celine wins the first round. -But you'd never miss, right? -Not bad. You're under pressure now. One more shot for Celine. Good assist, by the way. -Thank you. If you hit the crossbar, you win the first round. -We have a draw. Last one? One chance more? -Me and one more you. Let's see. OK. -Let's go, Alexia. Yeah, yeah, yeah. -Your opportunity. Let's go, Celine. Nice and soft. Oh, no. Too hard. -The balls are light. -They're very light. What do you think? One more or stop? I would go sudden death. -OK. Do you prefer this side or that? You can choose. What do you want? -That -At the same time? At the same time? -No, you first. -Technical! OK. -Yeah, at the same time. No, I have my whistle. -OK. -Yeah, Let's go! -Celine. -Thank you. So that's 1-0 for the first round. Come on. -We go to the next one. Good start of the challenge. Distraction penalties. One nil. Next round, penalties. -Ugh. -Are you good in penalties? Yeah, I think so. What's your favorite side? -I'm not gonna say it. -OK, yeah. Maybe quietly. -No, no. It depends on the goalkeeper. -You just look at it. I start? OK! Wait a minute. Normal penalties are a little bit too easy. So Billy can distract you. Oh! OK. -Have you seen my dance move? So both three attempts. -OK. I don't understand it all... the English, so it's perfect. First penalty. But the worm was good. It wasn't as good as the penalty, but that was good. I'm out of moves now, I'm out of moves. I have nothing left. -You can also make some noises. Alexia, watch out. This guy is crazy, OK? Yeah, don't worry. Come on, Alexia, -Good one. Billy is doing amazing. I didn't see you. -Which side do you want me? I'll go this way because of the cameraman. I'm just-- I'm delaying, you know? This is part of the-- -Oh! -What is this? -Great goal! That was the best barking goal I've ever seen. Yeah! -Speed would be jealous. Yeah, Jimbo! -No distraction for Alexia. Hey, that ball was not fair. -So, it's 2-2 now. Keeper, let's go! -That was a good one. It was dangerous, dangerous. -I was, wow, what's that for? But Alexia, if you score, you win this round. OK. Billy, just don't touch the ball or Alexia. That's the rule. -She missed! Shout out to Billy. Hey, I found my talent. -Distractions. -Yeah. No, no. I want to win. -Maybe weak foot? You know, sometimes I don't need to make a sound. I just need to do that. That's enough. Some black magic. Yeah, that's pretty much it. There's some Billy magic on the ball. I lied, I'm only joking. That was, that was very bad. I lied. It was too tactic. - Yeah, but that was very bad. That was like, stop filming. What was that? You can't distract a Ballon d'Or winner. It's impossible. No, that's true. No, what am I doing. It's disrespect. She's ready. -Great goal. -Well done. Should've made a bit of sound there. -So it's 1-1 now? -1-1. -We have a battle. -Great. Well played. -Well... -I was going to and I folded. -One, I can't get up there. -And two, you're the referee. Billy was too good at this. Let's see what I can do at the two-touch challenge. Next challenge is a two-touch challenge. That's also 1 plus 1 is... Billy, we'll throw the ball to you. But stay behind the line. So this side. Over the line is over. -OK. And now you start. No, I prefer last. No, you're not the referee. Wait, wait. -What?! No, no. Stop making your own Yeah, you choose. Alexia starts. Previous challenge, Alexia was saying, &quot;you start.&quot; And she didn't get a yellow card. -You start. -Oh, but I can't hear everything. -Sorry. If you complain more... -No, no. It's OK. It's Billy against Alexia, OK? -That's wrong. OK. -Oh, the touch is there. -OK, OK. OK. That's your challenge. -Thanks. The pressure is on. Oh, the touch. Yeah. -Oh. -The shoot was OK. -Good, 1-0 to Alexia. *EXPLAINING SOMETHING* *EXPLAINING SOMETHING* OK. No... Is that OK? For the touch, maybe a second yellow card. -Yeah, yeah!. Give me the red one. No, no, no. I'm not giving you a red one. Uber, quickly! Let's go. But I like the idea of the passing, so you can do it. But don't make your own rules, OK? OK, sure. Yeah, yeah. OK. -OK, Alexia. -With zero effort as well. Yeah, it's easy. Just like... -That's crazy. Good, good. If you miss now, you miss the challenge. It's over, yeah. So please score for our watch time. -Oh, what is that? That's a good shot. Oh!!! -The shot was good. One more and she can go for a hat-trick. Yeah, yeah. Let's do that. But she won already the second-- -Yeah. Sorry. Oh, the bounce, the bounce is tricky. Zero effort again. Good save. Maybe a little bit more effort for the next round. -Now you need to score, right? Come on, Celine. Oh, no. Yes, nice. Take your time. -Technique was good. Thank you. -Was it a good shot? Yeah? OK. Let's go! Not good control, but good shot. But you're honest. It was difficult because of Billy's pass. -The header was... Yeah, it's the assist. -Can't all be easy. Next. 2-1, Alexia. -Yeah, OK. And now, Billy, we need the perfect assist because it's the first touch challenge. OK. I'm losing now, but we keep on going. Time to test our touch. -You start now? Who starts? -Who starts, referee? *EXPLAINS THE CHALLENGE* *EXPLAINS THE CHALLENGE* You start and then me or at the same time? -No. -No fighting. -OK. So it's 2-1 now?

Oh, she puts the pressure on you. Alexia, please. Ready? Oh, that's a great ball. You can make it bounce. No, with your chest. Maybe with the bounce. Look, with the chest. -Oh, it's the mic. It's the mic, sorry. I will fix it. Sorry. -Like this. -With the bounce maybe? -No, what are you doing? -What are you doing? -Just do like this. That was perfect. Sorry, it's the pressure.

Alexia, we take it with the bounce or we want one without the bounce? -Depends on Billy's pass. One more, Alexia. -Yeah, yeah, OK. -No pressure. Oh, that's an easy one. -Oh, that's also a good one. Mm, no! No, it's one touch! -That's one touch. Yeah, that was one touch. -One more? Yeah, sure. -Almost the tripod. You see? I saved it. Oh, good ball, Billy. Yeah, she saved the tripod. Maybe one more, one more. One more, one more. Oh, good. Yeah, sorry, but that's one touch. What?!! Yeah, sorry, it's one touch. What do I need to say? -OK. -Final one for Celine. -Oh, that's a perfect one. Yeah, and now... -Oh, the line is in. -That's good. Thank you, Billy. Yeah, but Alexia made you start, so she won this challenge. -But you showed you can do it. Yeah, OK, that's the most important thing in my head. Vamos. Vamos. You write it with a V, &quot;vamos,&quot; but you say it with a B, &quot;bamos.&quot; -B and V is the same sound. You have to learn how to spell it... -Yeah. -OK, I understand. -The same sound, but different letter. I'm learning Spanish now. Belgium is so difficult. Belgium, the... yeah. -Language? -It's like... -Yeah. What do you want? -[In Dutch] Hello, how are you? -[In Dutch] What did you eat this morning? Oh, German, yeah. It's not the same, but it's, yeah, some words we can understand. But it's very hard. -Espanol is-- I think it's OK to learn. I watch some Netflix series and then, yeah, you can hear some words. Yeah, I think the verbs are the most difficult things. Yeah. We have a lot of, I don't know how you say it... -Past, future... forms. -French is also crazy. In German is... -...the same. -But I don't like it. Football, football. Um, was this a fair challenge? But now, quick fire shooting. Rock, paper, scissors, who starts? -In Spanish? "Piedra, papel, tijera." Ah, you win. -She starts, she starts. -&quot;Tijera&quot;, what is it, scissors? Piedra is... -Paper? -Rock, oh! And paper is papel. Oh, &quot;papel&quot;, yeah. Wait, wait. Penalty, yes. There you go. The passes can be harder, Billy. Oh, that's better, that's better. With the left one. Stay focused. Oh! No. Yeah! No!!! No, no, no. No!!! -No goal. Two goals. That's so bad. -I think two goals. And one very good goal. Stay focused. Oh!!! Alexia, go for five goals. -Let's go, Alexia. -OK. -OK. Oh, come on, keeper. Keeper! Oh! She was going for a chip. Three goals. Well done. Just for the video, that's not pretty good. Yeah, I'm so sorry. What's the score now? -Three? In my mind, it's 4-1. -No, it's three. -Right? 3-1. -You're the referee, yeah? Come on. -I don't know. -Celine, get the yellow card out, quick. You don't know it? -You deserve this one. Crossbar, you won. One-nil. -Yeah, penalties. -1-1. Shoot, shoot? You won. 3-1? The one-touch corner and this. -4-1. -Sorry, sorry. -4-1. Oh, the last one for three points? Yeah! Crossbar again. The one you won. That's my challenge. No, you can choose the last challenge. -Crossbar. I have a good one. Oh, that's good. -It's not so difficult. -It's not so much straight. -If the corner is perfect, it's not difficult. So, this is not going well. Time for our final challenge and three points. Corner kicks. For you, it's better that side. -Yeah, because I can't make it... Referee? -How many balls? So, we start with Alexia, maybe? I think she wants me to start. Alexia, who starts? You or Celine? -Celine. I told you. -Come on, Celine. Is there a maximum amount of bounces or you can do anything? That's a question? Because... it's kind of a question to the referee. I don't want to get the yellow card. OK. I don't think we care, OK? -So, just go. Let's go. First attempt. Oh, my dame. Goal!!! Wow. Oh, my dame. Wow, that was impressive. No bounce. Oh, no. Hey, that was going in. -No. You need one more and more. We need to see it. Oh, no. -No. In the pitch. The first was perfect. Was it luck or? I'm joking. -No, maybe... -She's tired. -She's tired. -But you scored one. So, the pressure is on. Oh, no. I can't support. OK, but Celine also scored the first one, right? True. If she scores now, we can go home, OK? -She's done it. -She's done it. But we want to see the last one, right? -Last? Make it a hat-trick. Yeah, yeah. Oh, my gosh. No, no, no. -That would have been crazy. Imagine the last one. Well done. -Good. -No more challenge? Now I'm ready. -Now you're ready? You want to do the crossbar again? If Alexia hits the crossbar, you all have to subscribe. Let's go. Come on. Let's go. -Subscribe. Alexia won. -Let's go. The corners were very good. Yeah. But also everything else. And Alexia just told me, like, now she's warmed up. Yeah. Now I can start. -Now she's ready. But now we will make a video for Billy, his channel, so maybe you are ready for his video Perfect. Overhead kicks from the halfway line. First to get it in the world's smallest top bins. I'm just joking. Imagine. -Thank you for the assist. No, you guys were incredible. Thank you, referee. Thank you. -Yeah. That rhymes... Kind of. Thank you very much. And we'll see you in the next video. -Peace. SUBSCRIBE!!!
