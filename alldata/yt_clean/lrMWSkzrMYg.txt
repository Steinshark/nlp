You are listening to The Great Simplification. I'm Nate Hagens. On this show, we describe how energy, the all fit together and what it might mean for By sharing insights from global thinkers, to play emergent roles in the coming Great I'd like to welcome Professor Steve Keen back Steve is author of Debunking Economics and Steve is among many other things, a research and Security at University College in London. He is writing a new book, and today we discuss a economic sleuth story on the origins of We go back all the way to Adam Smith and look classical and then neoclassical economists things that are not capital and labor. This is a difficult podcast. Steve is an economist, talks in a lot of economist I barely understood what he was saying, but his main message is that our main shaman of answers and explanations of what's happening divorced from our biophysical and ecological So this ultimately is a really big deal. There's a chapter in Steve's upcoming book treatment of energy blindness and its origins. Please welcome back to the show, Steve Keen. Steve Keen, good to see you. Welcome. Good to be back again, mate. Good to talk. This is a monumental podcast for three reasons. One, it's my last podcast of 2023 recording. Two, it's my first podcast on prep for a colonoscopy, too many times. And third, I think this is a, you have just that I often talk about: energy blindness. I know the result of why our culture, why have just written a book and a chapter on gone back to the original papers from the out why humanity has, over time, completely of wealth and productivity. So we could talk about climate change, you money, you know a lot about that, and we probably But today I want to just unpack your story months with respect to energy blindness. Okay, let's roll. First question, hit me. All right, so take me to the beginning. Okay. We had classical economists back in the day, Yeah. And virtually every economist, if you ask to answer Adam Smith. And in a sense, I was inclined that way except as well, including the Physiocrats. And my attitude was that the Physiocrats were and the role of energy in production, than Who were the Physiocrats? They were a bunch of 19th, 18th Century French, who worked in France, and this is before we ways. So they were people who were trying to analyze called Physiocrats because the leading personality, Quesnay. And Quesnay was the physician to the King And he was working at the time when we were what was inside a body. Because for a long time in the West there open a dead body. And then we started to do it, and Quesnay He found all these tubes running all over circulation for the body. And then when it came to looking at the economy, circulation. Goods go from one spot to another, money goes And there was this sense of saying, we can same way we're now realizing the body is because again. The arteries go through the body, they become There's circulation of blood, there's mixing where the vision. And in that sense, the basic paradigm they economists have ended up doing, it was biology. And that was a far more sensible starting And so instead of calling them bureaucrats, king, so they called them Physiocrats. Well, the most dominant personality was Quesnay, So he was a physician for the king, literally Now that did two things. He gave him enormous prominence. It also gave him plenty of spare time because to do something medical with. So for the rest of the time he was working as a sort of monetary and physical goods version This was in the 18th Century in Europe? 1700s, yeah. And they were trying as people like William functioned in England at similar times, Smith But the curious thing about being based in to Scotland, we're not comparing France to Smith, France was still overwhelmingly agricultural. Okay, agriculture dominated production in We had nothing like what was developing in Smith's book came out, I think the same year was sold. But of course we had the previous models before, steam engines. And you had steam power and water power and in Scotland. But from the point of view of the Physiocrats, was rural France. And what they saw was the farmer would plant of it. And so their orientation was that wealth comes goes into making something that gives it the They didn't even talk about that. Well, they did, but as a secondary factor. So they said the source of wealth is the land is the one who exploits what they call the And their perspective was first of all, to That was the opening four or five words of which was published in French 21 years before First of all, not only did Smith read French, for education and met Quesnay. So he was quite aware of the literature in and will never know whether Smith derived interactions with them because he insisted so we don't have any long-term record of the But this school of thought was very strong where wealth came from. And it wasn't from labor, it was from land. And then there were steam engines and we were influenced by Adam Smith. Well, that's much right in the wrong direction, of course with land, they said, well, the And that had many potential meanings. But fundamentally, from our perspective, looking Because the sun's energy lands on the soil, the husbandman's actual labor is far less and the exposure to natural elements, the And that was the source of wealth. And they said that the husbandman is the only And if you look at the writings, people like you look at it from the point of view that they are fundamentally saying the free gift And what is often would be called the surplus the energy put in by the husbandman and the And there's a wonderful sentence from Turgot gift of nature, which he did not pay for and Okay, it's beautiful. That's a microcosm of our entire economic Exactly, exactly. In that sense, the Physiocrats had it right. The one mistake they made, and this is the Smith played a role o,n this, is that they So what they saw for manufacturing is that sector and transforms it into some different Now, what we know, of course, is that manufacturing sense that we're exploiting fossil fuel energy, but it's basically stored solar power. And without that input in manufacturing, there'd And at the same point, the manufacturing transformed into useful energy. So the sensible perspective would've been of agriculture to then say, well, it's also And Smith could have done that because Smith farming in Scotland comparatively compared And in manufacturing we're using the free We're putting coal into the early steam engines. We've got water power, which is another gift But predominantly it was steam power and charcoal Coal is becoming very important, becoming Wealth of Nations. So he could have said, well, that's also the But he didn't, what he said instead was labor What you have out of that is the switch from being the source of us, transforming the inputs for us, which is consistent with the laws of wealth and division of labor being the And this is all effectively inside the economy. There's no reference to outside the economy. So I see Smith, by simply changing one word, is the source of wealth to Smith saying labor And that completely pushed the economics off We can only speculate why that happened, but on industrialization and all of a sudden we than a few decades earlier. And there was maybe a human exceptionalism industrious our citizens of Scotland are. We're creating these machines and we're creating And so that statement, that shift from the the farmer or the laborer, that was the origin I think so, and I can't criticize Smith for I would say it's a great pity, but I can't consequences. He didn't know the laws of thermodynamics. You can't criticize him for breaching something he actually spoke. But when you look at the, I'm not going to And even the word, even the word energy was I think. 1809, I think. So the word itself was taken from Greek, but an English colonist- Early 19th century. It's easy to make that mistake. No, no, no. I always get that confused too. Sorry, I interrupted you. You were saying? It's quoted in 1802, so we can't blame them blame Smith for not knowing that there's a The story continues though. It wasn't just Smith, the errors compounded. So what's next? Well, the next stage is once Smith said that of labor is the increase in value and wealth, to attack feudalism and argue in favor of When you look at the role of the classical trade. It was to promote freedom of movement and of the feudal system. So in that sense, it was pro-capitalist, and and Ricardo. Nobody regarded Smith and Ricardo was calling But along comes Marx. Now, Marx, not only Marx, there were plenty Marx turned up, who took the same idea that wage not equal to the entire product? Why does profit exist? That was the twist that was then taken interpreting of wealth. Say, well, if we're the source of wealth, And you have to go back and think about the centuries. I'm going to fall over that 21st century thing, But if you think about the state of Scotland it was like, it was Calcutta in the 1950s. It was stench everywhere from pigs being disemboweled, stacks, et cetera, et cetera. And I've forgotten who coined the phrase of But that was what Scotland looked like at And you had people who used to work in an rights that peasants had back in that time, became landless laborers fundamentally. Had to work in the industrial systems, then six days a week, thank God for the Sabbath. But six days a week, often sleeping inside It wasn't exactly going to be conducive to is. The other hand, of course, the capitalists bleeding the industrialization and so on, it was great. So what you had was for the working class economics became a ground for arguing for being produced. And that political shift was brought to a Well, he was prominent well before then, but and arguments for developing Marx's particular And Marx's was far more eloquent than saying He actually said, capitalists pay workers the commodity production system. They get their means of subsistence. That's the cost of reproducing the worker. &quot;It's a gain for the buyer of labor power, power, but by no means an injustice to the That's a quote from Marx. But anyway, what you got was Marx being used And now in that setting, the classical school class and the ruling class, effectively. The classical school being Adam Smith and Adam Smith, Ricardo, and through to ultimately which was called, had no particular name, economists. And the most prominent would be Augustin Cournot Cournot oligopoly theory. And so comes from Augustin Cournot back in a complete believer in a utility-maximizing view of capitalism as a system. And he was vehemently pro-capitalism, which all, but I'm saying he had a subjective theory objective. So Ricardo, for example, at one stage said, of production and not as has often been said So Ricardo was anti supply and demand. Most people, including neoclassical economists But when Marx became the bastion of the classical that stage, there was a very rapid turnover the subjective theory of value became dominant. And passing on from Say and Cournot to Marshall Can you briefly state what subjective versus Yeah. The objective values theory says that the So they ultimately, the cost of production whereas the subjective theory says it's a of the buyer and the profit-maximizing desires The two together set the price. And as Marshall ultimately says, &quot;It is as sets price as to ask which blade of a pair So they saw both having to play a role, but just labor that is a source of value, capital Now, when you read Marx properly, and I think I'm one of them, Rosovsky is another, but had an explanation for how capital can add terms. But I won't get into that here, but that's But anyway, the convention- because where we're headed, we're going to Labor is pretty clear. It's the husbandman, it's the worker. Now, how do you define capital back then? And is it the same today? That's the most difficult questions in economics. Okay. Capital is found in the machinery, capital almost identically as a word for money. Technology. Accumulated value of money. Okay, money. But there is no simple mapping from the physical And we'll talk a bit about how an energy approach later in our conversation. So with the old equations, if you substitute say labor and machinery in these 19th Century That would be the same inferences. That makes sense, yeah. So Marx- The Marx side, the physical machine adds no And this both as a distortion of his own philosophy, But if you have the labor theory of value It simply contributes to the output, what And there's a famous phrase in volume one a machine is, if it costs 150 pounds to make product 150 pounds or three weeks of labor.&quot; So it simply transfers its value, whereas That was Marx's labor theory of value argument. Now that contributes to the whole political who should get profit, should your capitalists And that was where the classical school suddenly So the subjective arguments of Say and Cournot, became much preferred. I really don't know the politics of the switch the Classical school was still dominant at By the 1870s, it was the Neoclassical School, were effectively marginalized, pardon the So the marginal school takes over and the to production and contribute to output. So Marx actually directly or indirectly influenced takeover of economics. Yeah. Now, when that happened... Of course, the real thing I'm interested in of particular... He's an actor in causing this, but he's not What started was the Physiocrats had the proto and that's correct. We know from the point of theory of thermodynamics, in the universe and what humanity does in concentrations of energy and use those to useful or to do mode of force with that energy us to produce goods and services. But we cannot create energy. We take energy in one form, we transfer it We actually degrade it according to the second So there's no surplus in that sense. What there is, is a gap between the energy the energy contained by that free source as And that is what we're taking advantage of, If we'd had the Physiocrats, we would've got sense caught up with the economists and developed could have said, &quot;Ah, that's what we've been perfectly with that.&quot; Instead, we got the wars between labor and the source of value? That completely ignored the role of energy. So the Neoclassical economists starting in from a biophysical Physiocrat explanation time that coal started to expand, we had just in earnest. Then what happened in the field of economics Bring us gradually up to the present moment. Well, you had Quesnay having a theory of production, of investment, being multiplied by transfer The first mathematical models came out with Neoclassical school, but there was still no, of production, which is the mathematical equations GDP as output.&quot; So until that point it was just stories and Yeah. And all of a sudden then at the late 19th equations? Yeah, Marshall and Walras and Jevons being into the 1920s. But the first attempt to have an actual what's So trying to relate the aggregate level of the level of a macroeconomy. The first attempt to do that in the Neoclassical function. In both Marshall's work and in Jevons' work, productivity. So you put a certain amount of labor in and You add more labor, you get not as much increase some positive returns. So this idea of marginal productivity of labor turned up in the Neoclassical theory. I think in 1898 or early in the 1890s, J.B. Clark developed the marginal productivity that workers receive the marginal product So that concept became built into Neoclassical So the wage is supposed to reflect the contribution rate of profit is supposed to reflect the turned on. But how did they know what percentage of the from the worker and from the machine? Well, they didn't actually know in that sense, But the basic concept with the marginal productivity marginal products would be based upon the call factors of production. So if labor gets 75% of GDP, and that was and capitalists get 25%, then the marginal product of capital is .25. So that was the general expectation, but nobody and Douglas, one being a mathematician, the economist- 1928, I think it was. Cobb and Douglas? Yeah. Okay. So they had painstakingly assembled a set Again, this is why it's important to know things happen, you also know the context in And today we're used to getting GDP figures three months. Then we get a breakdown of the contributions and statisticians. Groups of statisticians involved in making Back then, there were no numbers. There was one person maintaining an index on the amount of labor and no numbers on the So Douglas made up, fairly carefully, but that he could find to produce an index of of the output of machinery, not the entire put together the annual data between 1899 Cobb doing the work there. Again, of course, this is on paper. We probably had manual calculators back then. I imagine they would've been extremely expensive. They would've existed, maybe it was done by more painstaking than we're used to today and almost instantly getting the result. So just 23 numbers, all index numbers, all to different values in 1922. When they did a regression against that, they one production function. What that means is that you had output being a variable, a constant multiplied by capital one minus that power. So the question was what is the term? I'll call it alpha here, because they use Most economists use alpha for the share of GDP. Back at the time, roughly speaking, the share So the value for alpha is 0.25, and therefore The reason it's a homogenous of degree one, you double it, you get twice as much output So that's the term they found, and lo and of 0.76 and 0.24 and they said, &quot;Hey, this That's pretty close to 0.75 and 0.25. Yeah, so they got a number which, and in fact program of course, and I get exactly 0.25. So you get a very strong apparent confirmation They gave this the correlation coefficient, The R squared for doing it now is 0.94. Now the correlation coefficient is 0.97. Their response was, &quot;Oh, it looks fabulously what we expected for Neoclassical Theory.&quot; Now they got a lot of pushback initially, so popular because the results looked very But the entire formula was based on a data Yep. What Cobb and Douglas did, they showed the against the index for capital and the index But they said that their changed data also What they used was not what we'd use today, We take the log and the log difference, or say, &quot;What's the percentage rate of change?&quot; That when you do it, this is where I started dear Eliza, dear Eliza, the correlation coefficient same value of alpha. So you got a higher... You're confirming you didn't just get the capital, which are all growing. So the fact that they're all rising at the They said same correlation coefficient, same When I do it over the alpha of -0.15. Why is that? Because they didn't use the annual, the percentage I don't know. I wouldn't be able to find the original notes, for the data, which was all rising at one Any statistician will tell you that if you to get a high correlation coefficient just related to each other. So we should be looking for the differences be around zero. Even that doesn't apply to the first differences But in other words, they didn't get the results confidence people had in the results wasn't But people were confident. Oh, yeah. In the 1930s and 1940s, this was considered and outputs of an economic system describing Yeah. Now, we had all sorts of other approaches There was a long time, and this actually still 1980s or 1990s, that Neoclassical economists equilibrium models. These models had an input-output table as Now there's all sorts of issues for them, talking about. But at the same time, you had the rise of economists, and these were Neoclassical economists economy being perfectly flexible, get rid They started using much more commonly the replaced an input output model for the production and they went back to a single commodity idea. This is the aggregate production function. Of course they use the Cobb-Douglas production Now we had 30 or 40 years of that, and typical they've forgotten they ever used anything All of them use a Cobb-Douglas production They've all done what Solow brought in the technological change as part of the system. So they have output as a product of state letter A for, multiplied by labor to one minus That's where I think everything went wrong. Not that it was already going wrong with Cobb It was already going wrong with Adam Smith. Yeah, it's error after error. Economics is...I can define economics as compound All right, we're going to eventually translate You're an economist and you're a friend and planet, but you're also, here, you're functioning skill that you have. I've talked to you offline on what you've story. So keep going and bring us up to the present. So what did Solow do? Well, you started with Cobb and Douglas having L to the one minus alpha times K to the alpha Now then one of the criticisms that was made is where's technological change here? So they said, &quot;Well, we can bring technological This is in 1956, '57. &quot;We can bring it in and the way we have to I'll actually read them here, &quot;The new wrinkle segregating variations in output per head changes in the availability of capital per Naturally, every additional bit of information In this case, the price consists of one new labor in total income and one year assumption.&quot; Here we go, &quot;That factors are paid their marginal Other words, rather than being a mathematical is 0.25 and one minus alpha is 0.75. Let's just assume that they're... What the current values of the share of labor Alpha is 0.3, which means capitalists get So we just assume that and then we fit the We have a data series for labor, a data series We don't have technology. So the gap between the result we get for GDP call the growth of technological change. That ended up being 0.85. So 85% of the variation in output was explained to each other, but by this technological component. That became known as a Solow residual. So hold on a second. So from 1928 onwards, they had 75% was described Productivity is basically could be said our Then 30 years later they change it and said change in technology? Yeah. How does technology in Solow's definition differ from capital? Well, this is the problem. Technology in my opinion, is embodied in capital When we have technological change, what we to process energy and produce more complex So Cobb and Douglas were in that stance right But by Solow ringing in this idea of a residual, for labor and capital were given by income By that stage it was 30% going to capital So he did do data from the 1920s to the 1950s That's what he found when if you look in his of income and it's pretty much 30%/70% capitalists But he looked at the numbers and said, &quot;Wait And when you find a residual of something, But in his case it was 85%. 85%. The vast majority of the productivity could Well actually 87.5% in his initial paper. And that's okay in one sense you can say, of adding more labor or more capital or getting It's technological change.&quot; But fundamentally that was because technological component when we're talking about unskilled on a process line. I've actually done that at some stage in my button, pull this lever, put that thingamajig So where the technological change actually So if you go back before I worked as a manual used rivets to weld aluminum together, and So the technology is actually embodied in This is where the confusion of machines with clouded if you don't distinguish the two. But the terms we use capital for machinery social class does confuse matters. What I'm talking about is progressive confusion. Yeah, I'm a little confused myself now, but which you outlined to me on the phone, on So keep going. By the way, from Marx onward, Marx and Cobb all using terms like land and capital and in these papers. Correct. The only one who really does, for example, He uses the word 79 times in his Principles the innovative spirit of humans, not energy Energy is our... Yeah, not fossil energy, but the human spirit. Yeah, human spirit. So he actually talked about energy as various coal, and oil as inputs. But when it came to talking about energy itself, thermodynamics or the role of energy as a Whereas in Marx, Marx was actually reading to lectures in London and so on. So there's more awareness of the role of energy But what's happened is energy's dropped completely So first of all, Cobb and Douglas give you productivity theory of income distribution. They give you coefficients, which are what derived from the data. Then along comes Solow and said, &quot;Let's assume So the marginal product of labor is 0.7, and share of GDP. Then let's work out the residual and oh, I We're talking about technological change.&quot; But it was an unnecessary fudge. It then shielded Neoclassical economists from share of workers in GDP is equivalent to the capital makes to output. That's where it goes all awry. Because when you take a look at the data that that, and you do a regression based on the in capital, rather than getting a coefficient income distribution, you get a coefficient hang on a sec, we've got a contradiction between of capital to output and the theory of income The return to capital is actually much higher. So the exponent for capital is much higher And suddenly we would've seen this if Solow our technological change from capital itself. Oh. So that was a red herring that took us down the production function. Yeah. And leaving- So, what happened after... Go ahead. We're leaving energy out all the way through. So, what we have is in the Neoclassical camp, reflects their marginal product becomes just And they stick with the coefficients that than half a century- Still today? Still today. They haven't changed them. So if you look in almost any neoclassical is 0.3, and the exponent for labor is 0.7. Using data that Solow used from 1928 to 1950s? Yeah. If anybody's smart, they might go and take capital now gets 40%, and labor gets 60%. So they change to the 0.4 and 0.6, but they data, to choose what the exponents are in When you're getting a PhD in economics today, to read these fundamental papers of Marshall- Oh, no. And Cobb-Douglas and Marx and... No? No. This is one of the reasons why neoclassical They don't even know their own history. So, when I went through, you had to sit through macro and so on. They were part of... There's now what's called an America ABD, And the American system has enormous coursework didn't go through the American system, but time is spent doing courses rather than writing And you don't go back...the oldest paper you was developed in the 1970s. So, they just don't know their own history. What's the Lucas critique? That's another rabbit hole. But arguing that macro should be based on the Lucas critique. Okay. So, from Adam Smith to Marx to Marshall to away from the physiocrats of something physical. Back in France it was land, and the free energy And then we had a bonanza fossil carbon added What happened next? Solow all the way to the present day, or was Solow all the way to the present day in terms use. And then of course, energy is we've got to Because the thing is what happened to energy, but it's left out of those theories. And you then had a group of non-Orthodox economists, became fascinated with economics, and then of energy, and thought, &quot;We've got to bring and quite a range of other non-orthodox economists- I know both Bob and Reiner- So, did I. And you. So poor old Bob parting, what about three, I know, I know. I saw that. Maybe two months ago now. I'm glad I got to see him. Would've been only two months before he died up. So working with Bob, I thought, &quot;We've got a way of bringing energy into production.&quot; And what Kummel and Bob were doing was at to index numbers in what they call the LINEX This was an attempt to bring energy in, but function. So at some point they had the idea of index capital being part of the way they derived And my discomfort was that fundamentally what themselves have also done, is add energy in So you see, the way you produce output is Now, there's two problems with that. One is, that if you combine labor independently, independently, you don't have output, you've Energy has to be an input to labor and capital. And so what it finally occurred to me literally was full of statues, that walking through little thought popped in my brain, &quot;Labor Capital without energy is a sculpture.&quot; And bang, &quot;That's it.&quot; And I sat down at a table. That's it. Five minutes typing in a program called Mathcad, production function. So the basic idea was that energy is not an It's a factor you have to input to labor in form, otherwise they can't produce anything. Said differently, the laborers need food and capital, need to be turned on and powered Exactly. Exactly. ... which absolutely requires energy. Without energy the machines are worthless. Yeah. Now what then happened out of that was, the If I fed energy as an import to labor, the you've got, times how much energy they consume, in production. Now if we go back to the days of the Roman into production, fed a pittance, worked to of energy input, they could put out 100 watts And so their factor is 50%. But if you fast- forward to today, you and We're consuming tens of thousands of watts the heating, hot water, et cetera, et cetera. But only a tiny amount of our energy actually And fundamentally the amount of physical work and I'm terrible on the terms by the way, trained on the terms of energy and watts and So, I'll make all sorts of mistakes there. But the basic point is, the energy input of measures of energy, is no greater than was in any sense, to be able to consume more energy On the other hand, machinery has had an incredible can take. My favorite instance, I like what Musk is So I'm a bit of a space junkie. And a friend of mine was being abusive about what was the energy equivalent of the energy It was one third of a Hiroshima bomb. Now, for that to actually not lead to an explosion taking off and reaching a hundred kilometers the amount of energy that the ultimate machine If you go back to James Watt's steam engine, Now, that's a damn site less than one third So, most of what we've seen is a growth in levels we have has come from that increase And now we're cooking with gas in that sense, the role of energy in production, but that's So, this was a story of false turns at intersections And now, what would a neoclassical economist say to you in rebuttal, or defense, or contradiction, I'm going to have a bit of fun here. Rudi, if you're listening, Rudi Bachmann, economist would say, by actually saying what to come down to how have economists on the energy in a Cobb-Douglas production function, deduced about the role of energy and production. And Rudi thinks, I haven't got a sense of I want to share why I do that. So, Bachmamn and Co, about three or four authors, paper with an English translation on the issue GDP of Germany if we're cut off from Russian The argument they made was that was done by the Cobb-Douglas production function.&quot; Now what they did, and this is where the mistakes coefficients of 0.7 and 0.3, and then said, to energy.&quot; So you've still got the same homogenous production- Because energy is 4% of- 4% of GDP. Therefore, the coefficient is 0.04, and this This is where the twist comes in. Because the coefficient is 0.04, the mathematics tells you that the contribution of energy But all of the labor, and all of the machinery Far more important. Now here we got to get some quotes out of So they compared their work to what's called haven't even mentioned yet, but I'll bring And Wassily Leontief, is one of the few winners He was a Russian mathematician/economist, whole range of other positive contributions. But when looking at the ratio level of capital the numbers were developed, what he realized constant. Different between different countries, very countries, but generally speaking, the ratio, And he then said you could use that as an So rather than saying, &quot;The aggregate level one minus that power,&quot; you said, &quot;Output is And it was just an empirical regularity. And the post-Keynesian school, which I'm part function.&quot; So rather than the complicated neoclassical et cetera, we just say, &quot;Output is K divided figure, people normally used about three for the value of capital that same year. And then we get ridiculed for that, and because of substitution between labor and capital than we are with the production function that So Rudi then dived in this and took a look to the Leontief, using a form which is called won't go into that. Basically, in regard to Cobb-Douglas is at other. And they said that if you have the standard tells you you have a 10% fall in energy inputs, So we lose 10% of our energy, and GDP goes Yeah. Yeah. Now- Well that's ridiculous. I know. Okay, you and I both know that's ridiculous, look at the data. So, what they then said was that, and this The heading is, &quot;Extreme scenarios with low production at the macro level is nonsensical.&quot; So they had the blue dashed line, and the with energy supply in the Leontief case, the alpha, which is the exponent they used for So, 1/.04, while the marginal products of And then here's an assumption: &quot;If factor implies the price of energy jumps to one over This also implies expenditure and energy jumps We consider these predictions to be economically They are, but not because the Leontief case The Leontief actually fits the data. It's because the assumption that wages equal So, it's an empirical contradiction of the And the basic argument is that they think That's also a quote from the paper. So because they explained it at 0.04, that 0.4% change in output. So labor is far more significant, and capital When you look in the data, energy is 100% Explain that. What is the truth, based on all your work What is the actual equation of labor and capital, The basic truth is that the output is fundamentally If you take a look at the rate of growth of the rate of change of GDP at the global level, I was looking for this now, of 0.7 roughly, and change in energy is change in GDP is 0.97 So, in other words, fundamentally what GDP And so the core flawed assumption, which has and changed over centuries, is that we can It's almost like there's been a supernova wealth and productivity, and people are just equations on that, and increasingly divorced growing. And so, the energy blindness is that adding energy to the whole thing every year, that is a big explainer of our productivity. It's the fundamental explainer, and therefore machines which can handle more and more energy, That's where our wealth has come from. And economists have been blind to that by Adam Smith to throw out the physiocrats and And then you have the neoclassical saying, Then you had Cobb and Douglas saying, &quot;It's of labor to change in output is 70%, and the That then gets locked in by Solow, to turning and then putting it all in technological change but also hides them from the fact that the anyway. And now, when they come bring energy, they it a coefficient based on the percentage of therefore say energy has almost no role in And part of the reason is, that the energy is only the cost of energy that it is to extract, whatever. It's not the value that it provides, which and all that- In each barrel of oil. Yeah. Seriously, this is Nobel Prize sort of observation, people say at high positions of authority Again, I'll ask you would just a standard just anyone listening to this who has a Ph.D. school getting a master's or a PhD in economics, reaction going to be one of critical rejection, Oh, yeah. Or, is it like... Yeah? Absolutely. I mean- Because it affects their identity, or because It affects their identity. A younger one might actually go, &quot;Oh, hang You'll get a few who might react that way their ways. Okay, so speak to the young ones right now. Okay. If they're curious about this, and something and what they've just heard, what would you truth? The main thing is to realize that economics but it can't be inconsistent with them either. And what you are being taught, with your production of energy in an absolutely critical way. Now, if you go and want to do it empirically, between energy and production, drive it empirically, is 0.7 to 8.9597 as I've got in that particular GDP. So the fundamental insight from a thermodynamical first approximation, GDP is energy turned And then that means that the whole argument that, &quot;The wage reflects the marginal of product The wage and the return to capital for that to production. What labor and capital do, is harness energy And that will normally be done with machines. The machines have very fixed ratios of per per machine. So fundamentally, you get a fixed ratio. And that sense, the Leontief as an empirical That explanation is that the Leontief production machinery, multiplied by the efficiency with Neoclassical economists, back when I was in class. And smart people can be fooled, but they're So really, it still today boggles my mind energy, given anyone with three minutes on has 5.7 million BTUs in it, which is a lot that I do per day. So do they really think this? They really do. And the trouble is, this is where your mind So, if you get trained on the idea that production capital, and energy doesn't even turn up there, can be completely energy blind in the sense as much about energy as fish do about water. They simply take it for granted. And then you see this when neoclassicals actually is the role of energy in production?&quot; So this is again, this is from the paper by of Russian energy on German output. And they to take the Cobb-Douglas production to the inputs, and then we can say what's and here's a quote from the paper. &quot;Therefore, for example, a drop in energy 0.4%, which shows that production is quite This is expected from- Production is quite insensitive to- Quite insensitive to energy- ...energy. ... as expected by neoclassical economists, Right, it's a tautology of sorts. A tautology. They think that energy has a trivial role function. But when you revise- Why aren't there people calling them on this? Well, I am. The prime minister, or a senator, or a CEO- They all do- ... saying- ... one unit of economics. They all get the idea of labor and capital if they go that detailed in first year. But fundamentally, they get taught the whole And that actually ideologically is very reinforcing per salary, is because of my huge contribution So it ends up having an ideological role, that you simply don't have that impact on If you come down to the nuts and bolts of and you are getting a share of it, an overblown of capitalism. So if we truly defined energy correctly in nature might not all be funneled to the top And that, of course, leads to one of the reasons it enables them to be blind to their outsized goes their way. And also continues to indicate why we're blind Because if you include that, that reduces... Yeah. Yeah. The other side of the production function And when I do the Leontief function, which So with the logical reinterpretation of the is capital divided by capital output ratio, with which machines turn energy into useful That coefficient is going to be less than So it means most of what we produce is waste They can quantify it and say, &quot;If the efficiency is about roughly 0.2 or 0.25, then 0.8 to And that's what we dump into the environment. And that, of course, feeds back and damages If we had that insight 50 or 60 years ago, are in now of relying so much upon fossil Okay. I'm going to ask you an easier question, but Steve. What would you tell to a graduate student like philosophy or French or chemistry or To those people, why is it important that that our economists, and therefore, our politicians of our wealth the last century plus? Fundamentally, human civilization only exists If we didn't have energy in the form of the be sitting around fireplaces starting fires We might have a moderately sophisticated culture power and slave power under Romans and the But there wouldn't be the philosophy, there computers that we take for granted today. So if we don't understand the role of energy, came from. How does your view and that of Bob Ayres and biophysical economists, or in your case, Post-Keynesian of energy and the production function differ to gain traction in the 1970s, Howard Odom such? Is it nuance? Is it different? Okay. No, it's just basically finding a better way I mean, for example, Bob of course was in I was staying in his flat. It took me 10 minutes or less to work out It's ridiculously simple. But he then just said, &quot;That solves it. That brings in the role of energy.&quot; Because neither he nor Kummel had ever thought capital. They had energy as a third factor. And once you just say, &quot;It's got to be an I totally agree with that, but here's what If we don't have energy, all technologies I added to your statement and said, &quot;Cities probably going to have less energy in the But how we use that energy, how we combine and creativity, that does add something to Absolutely. Yeah. So it's the combination of machines, raw materials Phosphorus. ... neodymium and phosphorus and the fire, potential energy. And that comes up with a product that humans So how do you distinguish the contribution the machine and the new invention? I'm actually going to go right back to 1774 And I quote this in my new book because I paragraphs in the history of economics. And I just wish this had been where economics with Adam Smith. So pardon me, reading out a substantial segment And because the mistakes I was saying this including manufacturing, obviously. &quot;The husbandman is the only person whose labor of labor. He is therefore the sole source of all wealth. The land pays him directly the price of his Nature does not bargain with him to oblige necessary, what she grants as proportional, to the price of his days of labor.&quot; This is one of the punchlines. &quot;It is the physical result of the fertility of the laboriousness of the means with which So that's the role of humans involving concepts, &quot;As soon as the labor of the husbandman produces that nature records him as a pure gift over return and energy invested by the labors of This latter in selling to him gain only their his subsistence a wealth which is independent which he sells.&quot; Now all the ideas we're talking about are Earlier, you said you had a quote that you gives you back 1,000 seeds. But what if the husbandman was really clever back 2,000 seeds? The gift would still be from nature, but it intelligence. That's the line in the middle, &quot;It is a physical the wisdom far more so than their laboriousness.&quot; So in the terms of wisdom, what he's saying and that wisdom is far more important than Again, our ideas play an essential role and without our minds that can devise new ways and far more effectively. The wisdom is definitely in there and the It's embodied in the machine. So all this stuff, it said right back in 1774. That paragraph has far more wisdom than the So this is all kind of testable, although I think there's a possibility, and I know we could lose 20 percent of our energy in If we're lucky. Or more, but let's just say 20 percent. So I would think that would cause a 20 percent What would economists say? They'd say it would case an 0.8 percent drop 0.8? Yeah. Yeah. That's a strict-- And you think most economists actually believe Yep, I do. I've worked with them for long enough to know When you look at the data, change in GDP and moment in my book, it may change. But it's such a one-for-one relationship, And yet, they don't even look at it. And when Rudi Bachmann and friends made that 0.4 percent fall in GDP, obviously they didn't when Leontief actually reproduces the data. That would be like the opposite of a Nobel We should develop something like that. Well, the Nobel Prize is the opposite of a You are aware of that. No, I know. Okay, so there's that. In economics, yeah. There's synergy. All right. Big, big picture. Let's move to the stratosphere here. What are the implications of everything that our future and for our decisions and planning The fundamental of grounding is that without And we have been getting our energy out of And of course with fossil fuels, we generate That is causing global warming and that is systems depend. Now we've been blind of that, particularly in climate change, William Nordhaus and friends Right. So that's another flaw in the production function back in to the biosphere that is our only Because without oxygen and viable ecosystems, Yeah. No, that's not concluded in the way the neoclassicals And that's why you've got nonsense statements it's really, really difficult to find any on the bulk of the economy in the next 50 Now by the bulk of the economy, he meant all He even included all of mining, services industries, He could see no way in which climate change If we get a blanket ban on using fossil fuels climate in the next five years or so or 10 GDP and we're not prepared for it at all. I think if James Hansen and his colleagues climate warming temperatures in 2024 because to El Nino on the backs of the sulfur aerosols inertia. So we're going to see. And if we go up a half a degree Celsius next have massive impacts around the world. And then yes, you're right, people are going emissions are rising and fossil energy is But I think most people still don't understand the size and scope of our economy because Yeah. And economists have contributed this blindness absolutely essential. And on your previous podcast here, this is that economists, because of their identities will not change until there's a crisis. So can we anticipate what's going to happen that's going to happen gradually, with what's glass in case of emergency plans that are advise the French king, the modern equivalent Can we do that? I think it's incredibly late timing to be fossil fuels for about 85 percent of our energy, years. It's gone down to some extent for some time decline in hydroelectric, which that's the It's not wind and solar. Potentially, we're going to see quite serious Most of the climate scientists I'm in touch caused by a collapse in food output from one and that then leading to social breakdown need. Or wet-bulb catastrophe is the other one, than it would hit Westerners probably. But something which is catastrophic, which then leads to probably rogue behavior by governments managed to even reach an agreement to phase It'll be every country for itself in what be a very chaotic environment if we see something So you're saying that we shouldn't look to economic shaman and cheerleaders of our cultural We shouldn't look to them to change their They will be the most shocked and most confused They're useless. They've led us astray. It's just been a cascade of errors right back situation, but the last people that have any on the planet are economists, and the were change are also economists. So I would just like to kick them out of the They don't belong here. I tend to agree, but let me play devil's advocate. There are a lot of bright pro-future young postgraduate. Couldn't some of them take the kernels of and contribute to the science and understanding the traditional neoclassical economics departments I suspect your answer is going to be no, because are the tenured economists and they're not Or what do you think? No, it's a waste of time. I mean, some of the young ones are worth reaching Economics, fight against your curriculum.&quot; But fundamentally, if you want people to give engineers and they're the ones we should be... Get the engineers to look at it. The first thing an engineer is going to look That's just the nature of training of engineers. It's all about how you use energy and how than blowing things up. So the engineers are the ones we need to rely to build the alternative technologies in the a lot of them to go off and work out as financial bubbles in real estate and shares. We've had a huge misdirection of our intelligence And again, economists are to blame for that. When does your book come out and what's it Hopefully it'll be coming out. It depends upon the publisher's process, of And the title is going to be Rebuilding Economics Well, I've read the energy chapter and it I talk about what's going on now in the world, you have dug up by reading these original You also told me that most people in economics thank you. No, they never go back and read the original. Yeah. Originals. It's just shareable. Yeah. This was a little bit of a Sherlock Holmes function and the complete absence of energy And yet, energy is embedded in everything Do you have any closing words for listeners conversation? Just the main thing comes down to how economists, the dangers of climate change. So we're likely to see that striking this I mean, we both know the potential 0.5 degree El Nino plus the hypothetical role of leaving increase in global temperatures. That should cause absolutely chaotic weather So it's going to be brutally soon that this soon as possible so all the XR activists dial as soon as possible, start producing whatever the amount of carbon we're putting into the That's the most important thing to have some over the next two decades. If we don't do it, it's back to the Stone Thank you, Steve, as always. To be continued, my friend, and good luck Thank you. And all your future sleuthing. Indeed.
