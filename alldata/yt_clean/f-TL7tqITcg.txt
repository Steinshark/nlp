[Geoff White] Las Vegas, Nevada. [Jean Lee] The spiritual home of gambling, with [GW] This city in the desert hasn't been a while since the mob ruled the roost here. A bubble of warped reality where you can cruise Eiffel Tower or even visit an Egyptian pyramid. [GW] But every August, Vegas serves as the backdrop for a very different kind of culture clash. You've got parties, the jocks knocking back endless alcoholic the streets, bars and casinos, you've got another &quot;Good morning! Welcome to Black Hat! Questions, directions...&quot; [GW] Every year, the great and the good of for the Black Hat conference, named after the It's a tongue-in-cheek name actually, the hackers. That is, security researchers who use I was actually at the most recent event last [Clip of Geoff's talk] How does North Korea get its money? [GW] I also got to poke around the event a bit. So I'm at the conference now and this place is heaving with techies, and yes, a few of them are wearing TV shows. But these folks aren't criminals, at They work for legitimate companies and Black Hat front of their peers. And it was here that there circles. Even among the tech gurus here at Black a lot of people very, very worried indeed. [Barnaby Jack clip] I will be hole in the wall ATMs. I will go over walk-up far more important vector... [GW] It's 2010, and the Black Hat prime real estate on the Vegas Strip. by a security researcher called Barnaby Jack. [Barnaby Jack clip] So I will quickly demo the walk-up style attack. OK, so it boots, right now it should be... [JL] As you can probably tell from his accent, There's a video from that demonstration in a black shirt, there's a little swagger in his walk and an impish grin that hints that he could be up [GW] He's been given the to watch, because Barnaby's promised them something [JL] Next to him on stage is a pair of freestanding ATMs, cash machines, the kind you find [BJ] The attraction to target ATMs is fairly obvious, [GW] They look a bit weird standing there on stage, but the machines actually can buy a fully functioning cashpoint on the [BJ] I had the ATM delivery guy literally wheel in one of the ATMs, and he came in, and he's like, [Audience laughter] And I was feeling a little bit cheeky at the time, so I just looked and like, &quot;oh I [Laughter and applause] ...and he just kind of shook [JL] So, he owns these machines, he hasn't stolen any money either. In fact, he's loaded them [BJ] These are million dollar bills... probably not much use at the craps table. [JL] He starts typing lines of code into a laptop perched on a podium. Everything he types is projected discerning crowd can follow along. the crucial final commands into his keyboard. [BJ] Issue the jackpot command... we have a winner! [Cheering and applause] [BJ] I wanted there to be a big pile at the end. [Tiffany Rad] He wrote a piece of malware that could make the about it too is it didn't just do that but yet won the jackpot!' And the crowd loved it. [JL] This is Tiffany Rad. She witnessed Barnaby's demos, and yes, you heard her right: he'd worked out a giant pile using just computer code. [GW] It's a technique known in hacker circles as jackpotting. Barnaby's version of it was particularly to the machine. He could do it all remotely, over [JL] Tiffany's a hacker herself, as well as a lawyer and an academic, and like Barnaby she's hacking. That's breaking into real-world objects [GW] She first got into it because she wanted [Tiffany Rad] It was a time when you couldn't turn off the only way to really get that to turn off was and tell it to turn off all the time. [GW] I probably don't need to say this, but please do not try that on your own car at home. I asked Tiffany to tell me about Barnaby's jackpotting skills because unfortunately Barnaby is no longer [TR] He was known as being just a really happy generous loss to the security research community when he [GW] He was definitely a character. Case in point, he said he got the idea for jackpotting from [JL] It wasn't just in Las Vegas that Barnaby demoed security conferences all over the world. Tiffany Black Hat conference. [TR] It was held at Emirates Palace, which at the time [GW] Exactly the kind of place you [TR] ...a gold machine. Something [GW] A gold-dispensing ATM? That's crazy! of us at the time could... we're like, you know what, this is really interesting. And Barnaby looks He's like, &quot;that looks just like an ATM&quot;. So he manager came out and said yeah we know who you all just don't, don't take anything, but go ahead, give [GW] Barnaby connects a laptop to the port at the back of the ATM and he's getting ready to it doesn't actually have the permission of the [TR] So the owner of the gold machine found out that Barnaby was actively [JL] By the time he died, Barnaby may have been the ATM hack, he began tinkering with medical and he learned how to gain remote control show just how he could get those devices [GW] But he wasn't aiming to give tutorials their pacemakers, or how to rob cashpoints. in systems so banks could make them more manufacturers to the weaknesses he'd found, [BJ] The goal of the talk definitely isn't to You know, society relies on various proprietary devices, smart meters, parking meters, it's result of that research we can use that knowledge [TR] You'd rather hear about this from someone who's wants to help, than hearing about it because [GW] Still, it wasn't long before hacking gangs began their own viruses. Some might have been inspired will always be interested in exploiting [JL] This jackpotting racket catches You guessed it, North Korea's Lazarus Group. [GW] From the BBC World Service, this is [JL] I'm Jean Lee, I'm a journalist who opened the first and only US [GW] And I'm Geoff White, I'm an investigative journalist covering tech [JL] This is the story of the Lazarus Group, one of the most mysterious and working on behalf of a nation state: North Korea. North Korea strongly denies the Lazarus Group's very existence, calling these claims 'a [GW] But that's not what leading law enforcement North Korea's hackers are accused of doing next. and more ambitious than ever, enabling them to victims around the world. And despite the best track and tame them, like their biblical namesake, [Clips] North Korea is nothing if it is not creative, clever, agile... dollars in stolen funds. 2.1 billion dollars... and my hands, taken to an interrogation centre. Holy moly, that would be terrifying. I mean that would be so [Music] [GW] From the BBC World Service, this is The Lazarus Mumbai, India. It's the 14th of August 2018, a humid in the afternoon haze. Inside one of the city's is taking a quick break from fighting crime [Brijesh Singh] 15th of August is our It's a formal occasion where we hold our parades and all the VIPs gather to paramilitary, everybody participates. It's a [GW] So the day before, you're polishing your shoes [BS] I guess! [GW] So, not exactly a good time for Brijesh to get news of a major crime. [Indian news report] [BS] We first, strangely, got to know of the Cosmos uh you know, juniors came running to me and TV where they are saying that there has been a [JL] The bank in the news is the Cosmos largest banks. It's headquartered in Pune in [GW] Much as I love podcasting, I really wish we could a piercing gaze and impressively thick moustache. Mumbai's answer to a Bruce Willis action thriller called Quantum Siege. At the time of cyber crime unit, and that's where he is when [Indian news report] [BS] We were very surprised because by that ironical that we came to know of this not from [GW] So Brijesh stops polishing his What he hears worries him so much he decides [BS] And then I decided to leave for Pune. Pune is to be such a big attack I decided to go there to [GW] Pune. Population 7.5 million. It's a huge industrial as India's Motor City. Brijesh makes his way glass complex, to meet the bank's distraught [BS] They are like shattered. They didn't exactly know how to respond to this. [GW] A strange tale unfolds. The previous Saturday 11th of August, when not too many people were [Milind Kale] There were messages from Visa US a sharp increase in transactions during one hour and they were alerting us to go through [JL] This is Milind Kale, chairman of the bank. [GW] If you've probably sounding eerily familiar. urgent messages about suspicious transactions. It's attempted billion-dollar hack that we covered in and it's going to lead us down a very different [JL] This time, the calls are coming from Visa, one and they're calling from the US to say, hey you withdrawals connected to Cosmos Bank cards. Visa in for large amounts of cash. [GW] So, Milind's team look [MK] When they said the number of transactions and tried to check it at our end. But surprisingly, This continued for about half an hour. They back that there are no such transactions. [GW] The bank staff requests coming through on their computers, [JL] Thirty minutes later, they authorised Visa to stop [GW] But that half hour would turn out Visa were just the first warning signs of a giant shares the full list of suspect transactions [MK] Virtual 12,000 transactions. [GW] 12,000 transactions. That's 12,000 separate [JL] Police Inspector General Brijesh Singh can hardly believe [BS] In terms of Indian money, 94 crore rupees had gone. Some 14 million dollars. In [JL] He starts to pick over the traces of what is had done their best to cover their tracks. They'd But investigators had managed to find which gave a clue as to how and where the hackers [BS] There was some initial compromise through spear phishing, [GW] The phishing emails arrived in employees inboxes and said something like, you trick for computer hackers this, but those dodgy depressingly, they still work. [JL] As they did at Cosmos. prize turned out to be a virus that took hold [GW] Somehow, this intrusion had allowed [BS] That was basically a very well thought out knowledge of banking systems. [JL] The attacker Sounds like someone we know, right? [GW] Indeed it does, yes, from working out who's behind the attack and he get hold of some very useful info from inside [BS] We then got the data of withdrawals, then we found clusters that these are happening in [GW] He can see the precise locations of the cashpoints where dodgy withdrawals [JL] Quite a few of them were close by. In Maharashtra State, dozens of ATMs had been the crime he's dealing with. This heist required a and they're very well organised. [BS] We were very amazed. [GW] By locating the cash points, Brijesh can the exact moment the dodgy cash withdrawals are of different men, money mules, seemingly in their They walk up to the cash points, stick [JL] And Brijesh is watching footage of it happening. of the thieves in action? But of course, they [BS] They try and hide from the CCTV cameras, they try to cover their mouths, they try and disguise [GW] Brijesh is going to have his work cut to get even wilder. As the police and bank's teams happened and it turns out these withdrawals international jackpotting spree. [JL] Somehow, criminals ATMs in 28 different countries. [GW] And what makes All these withdrawals took place simultaneously And you've got to realise these 28 countries are Bulgaria, the UK, the United Arab Emirates, The attack happened in the afternoon in India, but Hackers have managed to compromise hundreds jackpot those machines at exactly the same time. [JL] How do you coordinate such an international continents simultaneously? [GW] And perhaps equally the attack, thousands of miles from India, something dodgy was about to go down. They [Adrian Nish] We picked up evidence that the Lazarus Group particularly clear who the end victim was, we had a [GW] Adrian Nish works for BAE Systems. They're huge defense contractor, they make fighter jets threat, they've concentrated on the digital side He once sat me down and went through a computer twist and turn in the code, it was amazing. Adrian the internet for clues about cyber crimes. [AN] The nature of crime that's been conducted over the internet means that activity is logged in one [GW] Adrian's team are experts in a command and control servers. Here's how it works. directly from your own computer, then the police So instead, you send your commands via another previously. This becomes your command and control [JL] Often, this middleman computer belongs they've been hacked. So, if a researcher like touch with whoever owns it, he can get access [AN] Once you have the logs from the servers, you can [GW] That's interesting. What can you find out about [AN] Everything. In certain cases, you can see the commands they've executed to carry out the was carried out and it's there as evidence. [GW] In June 2018, Adrian's team identify a command and control server that they're confident is being used by happening on this machine in real time. They're [JL] They suspect an attack is imminent on the victim is, but nevertheless they try to alert [AN] We didn't hear anything back and the next we knew, the story was in the news. We Group again, because we had been watching It would have been too much of a coincidence Probably they were in there for many know exactly what they did, but we do know they [JL] So, can I just point out how amazing it is that ATM machines to spit out cash all at the same time use ATMs, not even in the capital Pyongyang. It's a technology that would have been totally foreign Koreans defect to South Korea, one of the first process is how to open a bank account and how to how we use ATMs in the rest of the world, but when they were sent abroad on a cyber mission. [GW] That's amazing. So how do people get cash in North Korea if there aren't cashpoints? How do [JL] Well first of all, most North Koreans don't have reason to handle a state claims to take care of their needs; housing, twice a month for rations, whatever it is the state enough to go around, so North Koreans do what I've had North Koreans try to sell me biscuits In Pyongyang, the goal was always to be sent abroad workers, because the dollars, euros and Chinese a whole other economy and life in Pyongyang. cappuccinos and Coca-Colas. [GW] So what about you, how did [JL] Well, people like me who are there for work have to make sure euros and Chinese yuan in my wallet, just to cover a few foreigners who were there for business and their hotel bill with a credit card or get cash at [GW] Interesting stuff. But of course unlike most North Koreans it looks like the country's Lazarus cashpoint technology. [JL] That's right. Think back malware that would make one ATM spit out all its he'd have had to painstakingly target each ATM. the Lazarus Group used a whole new strategy. [GW] Yeah, the next bit is really clever, and to understand it, you're going to want to know a bit about how I'm sure you don't even care. You put in your card, But there's a bit more to it than that, as Adrian [AN] For you to get the money out of the cash machine, the cash machine needs to wherever that card is. It doesn't matter where in back to your issuing bank. Your issuing bank will [GW] The bit of software that handles all these messages the bit of software in the bank that checks got enough in your account, and tells the ATM to switch, and once the hackers were inside the one ATM withdrawals from anyone using a Cosmos Bank [JL] Yes, but surely to make withdrawals, the hackers would for 12,000 transactions around the world. How did [GW] Good point. Yes, to make a withdrawal from Cosmos, you need a card connected the hackers, they've got a trick up their sleeve. customers' bank details, so that's the account not exactly sure how they did this, but they're hold of real account details, or they could have however they did it, they end up with the details bank cards for those accounts. Sounds high-tech, but don't try this at home. In your wallet, you probably On the back is a black stripe, that's the magnetic few hundred dollars you can buy a machine on card data. It can overwrite it with whatever a hotel and they swipe your room key to encode of getting you into a hotel room, this clone cash card So, accomplices of the hackers take hundreds of these with the details of the 450 Cosmos Bank accounts [JL] OK, but surely they still [GW] It's another good point. obstacles for card fraudsters. But remember, in the ATM switch inside the bank. They not only see so when a withdrawal comes in from one of [AN] So when the message comes in, it gets to that that message, checks it against its local list a card number from one of their cloned cards, And the criminals on the street corner can just the ATM as the ATM will give it, and it will So this group, if there's one thing I have innovative. Every case is somewhat different. [GW] You can hear it there, can't you, in Adrian's comments, the grudging respect of an experienced security Lazarus Group. The hack itself is impressive, but [AN] What they did with the malware in terms of sophisticated, not something I don't think anybody the group have. I think that was probably on a [GW] Really? [AN] They would have had to learn again how to subvert [GW] Yeah. They seem to really know banks. They're [AN] Yeah. You know, it's months of research, it's be happy enough to get away with a couple of they think in orders of magnitude bigger. [GW] Of course, once a heist like this goes down, banks work hard to fix the vulnerability in their So if any world-class hackers are listening to to tell you that ATM switch software will likely that Cosmos job went down. [JL] It may be novel and lure of instant ATM jackpots is about to create [AN] It's certainly a very loud way of doing things. law enforcement in 28 countries! And then there because it was 28 countries with criminals in of these physical cards, they also had to have it wasn't that you go to one ATM and you, you know, will only give you a few hundred dollars at any but all within this two-hour window that the a considerable logistics operation just planning that. [JL] Inspector General Brijesh Singh is on the case, and he's going to [BS] These people were simultaneously coordinating in It was just like Abracadabra. Put these cards, put any PIN [GW] So, how did they do it? All those money mules making cash withdrawals around like the Lazarus Group wasn't working alone this [JL] The Cosmos Bank hack is going to lead us into corners of the internet. A cyber underworld [Clip] It is odd at first to see heroin, cocaine, It was a pretty bizarre world to be enmeshed in. [GW] That's next time, on The Lazarus Heist.
