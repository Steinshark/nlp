This Satsang is a Profound, Practical 3 November 2024 [Questioner 1] Thank you, Babaji. [Q.1] I just felt this urge today, And ... I see that this sense of 'my way'. [Mooji] Yes. OK. Slow down. Are the children happy? [Mooji] Hi. [waves] [Mooji] I still have the picture you gave me. [M.] OK. You're saying that Just say it in your own words again for me. [Q.1] Yes, I see the sense of, like I'm ... More that the words are like 'my way'. I keep trying to offer it up I've gone off on my own way, again. [Mooji] Naturally. but normally, naturally, So you're saying that ... 'I don't want to just follow the old traffic'. And to what? Speak a bit more. But when you do, you say you find, as a gesture, as an intention, you say, I see the old tendencies Especially, more recently, we're not scattering seeds far away. We're looking, asking you, So, if you're saying that what you're finding, although the gesture, the intention is to offer up 'my way', 'my way', beyond the gesture still, a kind of reflex [Q.1] And I could see, it's like the 'I' still believes [Mooji] Yes. Yes, yes, yes. How long is the queue standing behind you Thank you. We like honesty! We're just looking. OK. So, could you repeat? Because I think some people got left out there. [Q.1] Yes. It was clear in the past, there are times and when the prayer comes to offer it, I find it's like the authority of God And it can't come so strongly. Or, if it comes again then, But with this thing, I see, though something in me it's like the 'I' still feels It still secretly knows best. [Mooji] Yes, yes. And could it also be a kind of mechanism for protection That kind of feeling. that's very much exposing, but in an intelligent and wise way, the things that, actually, but more a kind of stagnant, stubborn energy We take this form and as long as we have and a loyalty to that identity, then those forces will not be challenged. [M.] Is it important that they're challenged? [M.] Yes, because unchecked, unrecognised, They don't just stay stale, We see that. Only recently, we've been sitting, having a wonderful opportunity who say, 'I'm here for this'. 'I'm here to transcend the grip, to escape from the grip I can clearly see that, you know, protecting it is, in a way, And in the field, you find people coming and saying, 'Yes, actually, I lay down my arms about this'. And yet, the people say, but like a monkey, So how to do it? I say, No need to kill the monkey. The very intention to kill the monkey mind ... Actually, it grows with conflict. So, we talked now about detachment, and this is how the 'Just Be' exercise came. And who has found it powerful? [lots of hands rising] [Mooji] Because it's not feeding it's not feeding those tendencies. Because when they come, For food. What is the food? You're still subscribing to them. So, I'm not so much speaking about Touching on lots of different ... For me always, the subject is one. So, recently, in very recent times, we have narrowed it down, the exposing of the vasanas, but to, actually, be willing to see that They inhibit, and also, and the powerful tool, mechanism, is shame. You'll feel like, 'I don't want it. Because people might see that Or whatever. But this is a ... about name and blame and shame. I'm so interested that we go beyond But this going, unlike other going, It means receding into a place within you, Really, the 'your place', our true place, full of joy and without need. While we're in the state of multiplicity, And is it normal, natural? Yes. Don't try to jump, merely as a person. If you're going to jump, But there's no need to jump. Continue, as we've started, to learn to allow rather than try to suppress tendencies, which really doesn't work in the long run. It may have some short-term [impact], they will still just find a way of living, Am I speaking on a common subject [Group] Yes. [Q.1] Somehow, I just wanted to ask you, can you turn up the pain of 'my way', or make more obvious the pain of 'my way'? That even one step feels like, no. [Mooji] Yes. Your prayers work. Your prayers, or your intention, your choice, this is a power that we have. You may say, I've chosen many things But maybe behind that superficial choice, a deeper internal choice to be free. And so, whatever you're praying to, you're having sufficient trust in that to say, 'Well, in the end, Your will be done'. You're going to see later that but for the time being, So, I was speaking, calling up ... amongst some of the people one came the other day, saying ... I could see he had this kind of look, a little bit on the verge between constipation This is a good sign in the sangha, actually, we're processing something, And he said, He said, 'But I don't want water. I want petrol!' Do you understand? There is a greatness about this fire. that everything inside there is a sense here from the grip of this identity. It's happening and it's not so linear. It can feel like this one day and [opening up] And still, all these things are perceivable, deeper, receding deeper, in the place of just perceiving. And this is very important, but not shopping, not war, just observing and also being aware that you are aware of what you're seeing. More than logging into the energy externally and internally, or your feelings, emotions, memory, all of these things are coming. And I want to encourage that Make a start and you'll see, so much space comes. Sometimes you've heard me say, Just like your finger can cover the sun, a finger, this size, can cover the sun, because it's so near here, in some ways, not this way [up], they're blocking you Not just seeing, a realisation Rather than what we take ourselves to be. So, don't look at and take them too seriously. Do you understand? Don't depend on, No, leave all of that. Be in the place, only as awareness itself. Get used to looking as and from [Mooji] Do you need imagination for this? [M.] Did somebody say yes? Yes, imagination in the beginning is also ... but at least the intention is good. that, 'Even if I imagine something, It may make it effective, So, when I say recede, I mean pull back and intention and history and identity and all the things that come together to make you call these things yourself. Why do I call it 'not yourself'? All of it is just like ... and you see, Beautiful clouds, ugly clouds, whatever. everything is a tourist, passing. But the immensity, is unchanging, and the clouds, or tornados or whatever, nothing sticks to the space in which they appear. It's a good metaphor for what we are. It's always like that, So being aware of it, That all that you see, is the play of time and change. Nothing is stable there. You will not see the eternal with physical eyes. But you're looking from the eternal, Because you can also look with your eyes is phenomenal and you, the one who is looking, are also phenomenal. You see? because the ego can also look, but its range is very limited, With personal self-interest. And that's been going on for a long time. But I said, recede back Why do I say that? that even personal identity We can give personal identity that we don't like so much, And its world and mechanism are also phenomenal. Do I need to explain It means, whatever it is, that you can perceive, that comes through the mind or the senses, meaning it's just an appearance. It's just an appearance. But the more, what you see, if you log in to the energy field of what you see, then it will become part of your energy field. But even the energy field of this person and the person As I'm speaking, you should be seeing! I'm not asking you for homework for later. What I'm saying is verifiable now! You will come into the now-ness, the current of now. So I'm not passing concepts around. If you're following, you're seeing, I'm not even asking you to believe and trust ... No, it's fresher than belief, That the sense of ... 'Please present half a paragraph of 300 words of your autobiography ... Tell me something about you.' What you put down on paper, about yourself, is it real? Real, meaning, if something is real, it has always got to be real. And what I want to say is that they've all been personalised. That's why we have to go back to, Is there anything which is real for everybody? Which is true for everybody? Because everyone has their version You say, So these are, I would say, localisations, personalisations of what we call true. What can be true? OK, we're going to call this, And then, collectively we do it, We have shared concepts And we fight about them! But for you, you must come and see, 'Whatever I see, whatever comes it is situational, subjective. Meaning that, I swear on the scriptures about it. Tomorrow I feel differently.' So there must be something OK? Not out there, Recede into a place where you see everything, you have to confirm, 'My feelings? For the moment.' [Mooji] Is it true or not? [Mooji] You see? differ from person to person. And you know what? So that you will not be able You must go beyond, or find that which is beyond the phenomenal, which is beyond opinion, beyond subjective perception, beyond personhood, beyond world view, beyond social conditioning, religious conditioning, political conditioning, even species conditioning. Where are you going to go? You must recede back Where is pure being? Well, first I'll tell you, But what we have come to take as ourselves is the conditioned identity, which you cannot keep. One day, and the mind will be gone. Even the instrument for tasting and experiencing, this is also phenomenal, it will also go. But what I call yourself, and I'm hoping we're here for this, to clarify, to verify inside yourself, That, which can never go. That, which alone is eternal, and perfect, Whose perfume is joy, and peace. Who is without lacking, who is beyond poor and rich, beyond the treasures of this world. I have the delight in my heart to tell you: it is you. But now it has to be proven. On what basis can it be proven? If everybody in the world says to you, you may still not agree. You have to find that place, that is unarguable. Where can it be? It must be beyond the field of opinions, beyond the field of conditioning, because all this you know. Everything you call yourself, Even your faith you can change. But That which is aware of faith Something that is so original, so pure, that nothing can damage it. And yet, something can hide it. But from whom? A little mystery. Out of some yearning that is growing inside you, you ask, ''Please, can you help me, to burn this thing that keeps coming up? I'm sitting here, and like some uncontrollable reflex, this thing comes up again, 'No, you need this', and that force comes up and some arrogance comes up, how to get rid of these?'' I say, I'll tell you how. without believing in them. Just see them as sensations. Because in a moment, they will also go. It's like all these forces and these images, thoughts and feelings, to audition for your attention. OK? And because we have been habituated something like a reflex, it's as though you're flowing down the road. But remember, that flow is also phenomenal! And I'm here to check in with you, and say ... You say, 'No, no, I say, But you're watching this thing. This is all an on-screen report. [Mooji] Am I going too fast? Tell me. [Mooji] All that you're seeing, Meaning that it's in your head, in the theatre of consciousness, And it's not just thoughts, it's also flowing in your blood. It's in the energy, the internal field, But it's still phenomenal to this deep seeing, You cannot see this source. [M.] Do you understand? [M.] Because if you could see the source, then you would be more subtle [Mooji] Can you see, as we speak? [Mooji] If you're following this, what is happening to your idea of yourself? Slow down. Because the reflex is, 'What is your name?' 'Where do you live?' We have all these kinds of rehearsals in us, that you define and convey, naturally. I don't want that when somebody asks, you reply, 'I'm the Supreme'. I'm just saying, for your seeing, It's not that we are training You will find your way, the God self, is wise. It's not naive and arrogant. You see? So, it's not that 'Learn how to be' is only It's just another form about being. You see? 'Ah, this is my version, today'. Next week, we see you, How can this be you? Can I say it is you? I'm going to say something, It is you in your play, in your expression as changefulness. But something is aware, or is being made aware here, of an earlier ... I'm using the word earlier, I mean earlier only in terms of subtlety, that these things can be seen. But you're not aware, Now you're being aware that, yes, it's true. There are some things, that appear inside your field of consciousness and mind, there are no names for them. They've not been catalogued. There are some sensations that are so ... They don't show up in any textbook. They're not on any video online. They're not in any, But they show up subtly, inside. Why? In front of whom? In front of That! What do I call That? Or This? Nobody has told us that this awareness is the very root of our existence. And that it is imperishable. And a few years ago, you were presented with the 'Invitation to Freedom'. Where you could actually recede, recede in your looking, to learn to look without becoming so involved, To do it. Did you find something tangible? Ultimate discovery. You cannot show. What is your self-portrait here? Then you see all your self-portraits were just moments of phenomenal states, mental states, imagined states. What is the ultimate truth of you? What gender is it? What religion? What race? Beyond all these things. That which I am attempting to convey, is not just in words. It's the Beingness inside you. We're in a kind of seemingly verbal discussion, to discover a non-verbal place. [Mooji] Yes or not? [Mooji] Does it come and go, in itself? That which is? Is it in front of imagination? Or even behind imagination? Is it something that Is it not that even imaginations and imaginings, even in their subtlest manifestations, Are you sure you understand means in this usage here? It means anything that you can perceive any emotion, any thought, any object, any belief. The reality of a thing, is not in the thing, but in the mind of the one perceiving it. That's why we can have different opinions 'Oh, this is so beautiful!' Are they right? 'Oh, look how beautiful they are!' Who's more true about it? Is the flower going, 'No! I'm beautiful!' So, still, the meaning, the meaning of something We don't even know what it is! It is just what it is, for now. But for you, you say, 'This one ...' This is also the brilliance of God spread out in different languages, so we can see that things are not the words, the things you say they are, nor are you. [Mooji] Are we OK like this for now? [Group] Yes. [Mooji] So, coming back to your request or question, [Mooji] say again, what your question was? How much alive is it? [Mooji] Word for word, [laughter] [Mooji] Hmm? [Q.1] It dies in the looking, Guruji. [Mooji] Yes. It was created in thought. And perishes in seeing. But in the big picture, nothing happened. Momentariness dancing. OK. You. [Q.1] Thank you. [Mooji] And also, may I say, It's not, 'OK, been there, covered that'. Leave it where it is. Whether that thing stays hot you are here. What was altered in your reality, You are the witness of the sense of presence Who or what can you be? Sometimes questions are more important but not just questions, [gestures to Questioner 2] powerful fire stirred up in here. And I just need to expose it, completely, in your light. I'm not here to protect this. [Mooji] OK. Now, this fire, is it to be gotten rid of? Is it a messenger? Is it an agent delivering something for you? Has it got nothing to do What is the status of this fire, that you speak of? We all know what we are speaking about, no? Maybe not in its unique expression but we know about the fires, [Q.2] Yes, it is something to hold me in that identity. [Mooji] Yes. For the moment, yes. 'The power to hold.' [M.] Can we do that a little bit? [Mooji] So, there is a fire, It has the power to trap your attention. It's holding ... [laughter] [Mooji] OK? And now you, what? You're what? In the light of what we are sharing. It's got the attention, and something is, 'Whoa!' Now, I'm not asking you to go and separate, or to calm an energy down. I'm asking that, whatever it is, it will still share the same status. It's coming right now, and something is going, or, 'I love it!' OK? 'Pff! Whoa!' Suppose it's like this. Because we can see it sometimes, and somebody is, 'Whoa, pff'. What's that? Possession? Something is happening, Maybe some flaring up of emotion, or something is telling you something, a voice, or a message inside. Or just pure energy! It's just energy. What is it? [Q.2] Yes, I think it's, actually, there is this space of ... The space where, whatever it is, it really doesn't have but if I give my attention to it ... [Mooji] No, It's tailor made at the moment, or for a while. Because if it had nothing at all, then it wouldn't register. [Q.2] It's like, whatever meaning I give to it, [Mooji] Yes, OK. You being what? [Q.2] Yes. Whatever ... This one? Can it exist for ... It exists. Who's reporting? So, it's in relation to the sense of yourself, because you're sitting next to somebody, they're not at all troubled about it. A private hurricane is going on. So it's come up, it's a relationship of a self-image, or a sense of self, and a circumstantial force is coming up, Is there anything else in there? Is there any other thing there? I'll help you, like, the capacity is there to see this dog fight going on. And that the stimulant energy, identity is also witnessable, or not? [Q.2] Yes. it's still a relationship to something. So, this things is going, Can you see it? Can this one who's seeing the thing and who's receiving advice on how to be with it, can it be seen, that it's in a space that is completely untouched by it, [Mooji] We don't go there! Usually, when the show is on, But you're asked to say, 'Even this'. Because the reflex is to bring the water, But I'm saying, No, use the fire! [Q.2] Yes, that's why I'm standing up, to really bring more gasoline wherever it is coming from. [Mooji] If the seeing is clean, How does it sound? That sounds quite neat! That sounds good. Write it down. If the seeing of it, it doesn't ... Is it possible to see you're ... If you see something and you can report, Somebody was driving down the road, One person came out It all goes to court, and you too. 'Listen, we bring in the first witness.' You're the witness. 'I was sitting on the corner of the road, I saw this red car come around, The green car was moving slowly. 'The red car's driver came out, walked over to the man in the green car, just walked up And he was an old man. He was just going ... And he got punched in the face.' 'Your Honour, I couldn't bear it, actually.' 'So I went inside and I grabbed the guy and I kicked him in the nuts.' So what happened? Now he's part of the crime scene, isn't it so? 'Do we have another witness, Who is outside of the crime scene? So, in this thing, I use as an example, we don't know when it will come. Of course, it's personal. Maybe you can't even listen It's just, you're so ... that there's not even any space to look at it. We can just suffer, only. And, maybe, someone comes and says, 'But you're seeing this, no? 'I was sitting here reading my book. 'What happened to the one, 'Oh, that one went.' [laughs] Or the same one transformed I say, It's not true. The witness, the capacity to witness, Is it possible that through being you're learning more and more It's not that I've got to keep believing. And what's the fruit? And where is it going? You're receding. When I was coming in, I wanted to come around this way. I saw some baby shoes, small shoes. I said, Good, my followers are disappearing. They're shrinking! A joke, OK? After you come, you're all here, everybody is here, and what is happening? What have you got to show for one year, two years, however many years? [Q.2] Babaji, I feel it is the quality and the pointing to the vasanas, that actually, that allows these things to now ... [Mooji] Who wins in this ratio? The personal sense that is, And the reacting one, reacting, reacting. OK? In this moment, who wins? Does the frustrated angry one win? And the capacity to observe this, Not to suppress, But the real activity of using the thing is you say, In this particular thing! until you can see that Before, during, and after, Is such a thing possible? Is it telling you that you should not feel? Even within this, once you see it, actions, reactions, and interactions but the character of personhood has changed. It has changed. And that's the one thing the shift from person to presence. The person is the scene, the crime scene, in some way they involve But the witness is what? Did the witness grow? Did the witness lose? What is the shape of the witness? You have to start to realise And nobody's doing it, You have to be somebody. You have to be well known. You have to meet your goals. So we're always constructing an identity You're constipated with concepts. Yet your pure Being ... All awakened beings are the living embodiment And they would tell you, anybody, What you call 'you' and 'me' You are pure consciousness. Does that mean that all answering 'Yes!' Or whatever? No. All this flavour can be there. We have misread and misunderstood the world, because you see it from the polluted you think the world is horrible and stuff. Our behaviour is horrible. When you come back here, [indicates heart] Today, keep looking, is also mixed with the violence in you. All the other things are there. Does it mean you live life with your hands in your pockets; No. It can be whatever it is! You'll be seeing with the eyes of light, All our life is all circumstances, You have to see where my words are not words, they become spirit-force, You unbecome this character, And, somehow, a shift comes into the seeing. You're not going to create yourself. I'm not telling you about The Self is not a version of anything. It's the purity of Being. I have nothing theoretical to share with you. We have the facility of words But above all things, Without that spiritual presence, no word, no scripture means anything at all! So, in the end, reflecting who you truly are. How deep can these go? Of what value are the things we're sharing? I'm not asking you to create. But to look. Learn to really look. [Q.2] It's the most important [M.] Yes. Not just what you're looking at, but where you're looking from, And also transcend the idea and the identity of being, like, Because that's also phenomenal. Joy, yes, joy is a nice perfume. What is happening, Can you feel this tumour of tightness is blocked, And actually, that's kind of where you are. Who has imprisoned you? This person: fact or fiction? From the place where you're looking, where even the act of seeing is perceived, even the function of perception is perceived, by what can that itself be perceived? These are verifiable, now! Don't be taking notes. Verifiable now! Someone shared with me, there's a fear that I felt it was a very good point because it means that that fear is alive inside, because it's like the fear of the unknown. And I want to tell you, to the mind. It's only unknown, because we station ourself And to the mind, the mind-field, Who has the correct mind? If it's mixed with ego or personhood, Should you clean your vision Forget about it! Your vision will be automatically set right, when you see from where you're seeing, that even vision itself is phenomenal to you. This food is for eating. Your mind wants a take-away. If you're eating and enjoying, do you have to be thinking Whether there is ... No. You just enjoy. Do you have to ask the body if it's enjoying? How are you feeling? Empty or full? [Voices in group] Both. [Mooji] May I tell you? [Q.2] Yes. [Mooji] What is its status? [Q.2] No status. [Mooji] Is this a disappointing Experientially, we're not in the world. We're using thought to discover So I'm not giving you more thoughts. Who are you here? Who precisely are you? Who are you, in the light of our introspection and our probing, internally? Who are you? Whatever shape you may be holding onto, is it phenomenal or non-phenomenal? Will it not be phenomenal? Is your reality provable [Voices in group] No. [Mooji] Can any phenomenon judge Is this talk merely intellectual? I need to hear from you. [Mooji] OK, but ... [silence] [Mooji] Unfinished? Tell me, tell me. [M.] You know, you can determine. Slow down. Slow down. And you look, something looks. But what is the question? Is it finished? Is it optional, your answer? May I ask like that, is It, in itself, finished? Because in Itself that may ... You have these vasanic energies They cause a lot of trouble, And then it feels like it's over. Is it over? Is it gone? No. It subsides. It's still there at some level, I'm asking that, I very much enjoy travel reports. It was a beautiful title. Vesavio is the volcano. Vesavio? [Voices] Vesuvius. Vesuvio. [Mooji] Under the shadow of this volcano. In? [Voices] Napoli. [M.] I think the Neapolitans ... What do you call the people from there? Because I always think of the ice cream. They almost ... living under the shadow of... It's already burst [erupted] one time Now, the city is the most vibrant place, I saw. We went there, because I went with you, also. We went to travel there. And it says, 'Living in the Shadow of Vesuvio', so it means that this volcano, it's alive, And life goes on! Pizza! [mimics vibrant community] It's amazing! I love the feeling there. In this way, life is very ... Energy? Dynamic! Is this force, Are we living under the shadow [M.] Say the word Vesu ... [Mooji] Vesuvio? OK. [Mooji] Plenty of Italians And what does it matter if it subsides Because we're here to be cured. No? Very little comeback. OK. I'm not a performer. OK. [Q.3] It doesn't really matter. [Mooji] She says, whether it subsides, and its subsidence is permanent the answer comes, 'It doesn't matter!' I want to just give there, [microphone] OK, all right, you got one here. [Mooji] Why doesn't it matter? [Questioner 3] You stay with the witness. [Mooji] You stay with the witness. What's so great about the witness? Shots are going off, and like, 'Whoa, no, I can't talk right now, I need some time by myself'. But now, even if it subsides, some say, 'I wish it would go away. Another says, 'Put petrol, put more petrol on'. And another response comes, It doesn't matter if it comes, Why doesn't it matter? [Q.3] Because that's what I am. [M.] Why doesn't it matter? [Q.3] It ... [M.] I think her answer is coming [M.] OK. Because? [Mooji] Maybe it used to matter! But from the place you're speaking from, somehow, from the place of the witness, Yes, there is a kind of theatrical ... There's a kind of victim, Like, 'I don't like that, when people So somebody says something, 'Peanuts', and, 'Argh, who said, &quot;Peanuts&quot;, man?' And so that becomes a fireball. Then somebody says, OK, so, but then, at some point, 'Actually, maybe the same person [laughter] [Mooji laughs] Don't repeat. OK? [laughs] Who had this peanuts problem, itself now, at another point, Why are you laughing so much? He's saying, 'It doesn't matter'. As previously, it would have mattered. Or is it just that it doesn't matter, for now? [Q.3] It is, there is ... Like you can witness and then just be with the flow you can witness, that it is going to be transcended. But observe that it's going to subside And eventually, it's going to be gone, [Mooji] It loses, it loses its its potency, because it doesn't get fed, with what? Identity. Not just attention, but identity also. [Q.3] With identity, because you don't want to feel it, or you fight it with force you are giving it energy. As much as you can witness, It's going to leave at some point. It's not important how long it takes. [Mooji] What happens if it doesn't work? [M.] If you can't seem to come out of it, [M.] 'Argh!' 'Somehow stay as the witness. How long should I stay as the witness for? [laughter] You've tried. 'Like it just won't go away!' Tell me something. Give me some space. [Voices in group] It always goes away ... sometime. [M.] Yes. It always goes. [M.] But my point is that... [Voices in group] ... Who it's going and coming for, [M.] 'Who it's going and coming for', It's not that it's there or not, but who it's coming and going for, [Q.3] It's the one that is disturbed. [M.] The very fact that is a place to apply your own sadhana. Why? Because as long as the force Not that it appears. It can appear. Anything can appear. But you're to do the work. It is to be aware, OK, the body is ... Can you witness this? [M.] Even shaking. 'Waah!' Can you witness this? [M.] Is the witness disturbed? Very important! [Q.3] It's a great opportunity each time. [M.] Why? Is it to get away from feelings? [M.] No. It's not to get away from feelings. Make use of them, they come to reveal, Not even more stable. The real! [Q.3] And in my experience, it's very helpful, because it can be, but it can really help to go beyond [Q.3] more than more sweet feelings. [Q.3] Which also are very good to... [M.] It's part of ... A sense of relief. Why not? It's all there. [Q.3] Exactly. [Q.3] And we are happy ... also the sense of this identification Because it's fine. [Mooji] It's all fine, yes. [Mooji] So what's the highest realisation What's the greatest value, then? You may say, actually, it became calm again. What's the height of this thing? [Voice in group] It's confirmation that [M.] She said, 'The confirmation You being what, that never moved? [M.] Is this of value, you guys? [Mooji] Thank you, it's got to be of value. Is this a new feature in our existence? No. It's always been here. is not to turn every situation But to find out who the experiencer is, and realise that the experiencer That even the personal is also experienced, and that we don't have to You need to know what you are! And not a psychological, mental or conceptual, or what you may call, not a philosophical discovery. It's just the end of suffering! And the realisation of one's true nature, beyond conceptual satisfaction! When? Where is this truth placed? What is its dimension, its proportions? What direction must I first go, to find it? Where is it most found? Is Truth true now? Can it be untruth? Even the word Truth, what does it mean? It's just a symbol for This, Pure Consciousness, the Eternal, the Ever-gracious, the Imperishable, the Supreme. Is it that you become equal with the Supreme? No. It's beyond equal. Not equal! Oneness, meaning, of. [silence] Do we need some notebooks [Group] No. [Mooji] Direct experience! [Mooji] Direct experience. If it's for mental understanding only, The mind is doing it. It's OK too. But do you need to make notes? Is it recorded? Yeah, we're recording. We have many friends joining us from different parts of the world Are they less? Do they have ... Are they at a lesser advantage, than you, [Group] No. [silence] [Mooji] Even if you are far, far, far away online, your experience is, 'I'm here'. Your experience of yourself is, 'I'm here'. You're always, 'I am here'. You go to the moon, 'Where are you, son?' 'I am here.' You never say, 'I am there'. You may say, 'I want to go there'. This 'here' and the sense 'I am', they are one. But the person is its play, And its wisdom dancing, also. But each one will grow in understanding, experiential understanding, grasping. Growing, growing, expanding in what? Joy. Limitlessness. Limitlessness! Is your form limitless? No. It's a construct. Is the Self a construct? There is a field now, [Mooji] Yes or no? [Mooji] Yes. What is it? Space given to That, which is everywhere! The very ground, the heart of Being. What language is it? Consciousness is its language. Hold on to your self-definition, hold, hold, hold him, hold him. Hold on to your problem. 'Ughh!' Actually, all problems, but also to dissolve them. And it's dissolved in real understanding. Meaning they lose their influence Were we not supposed to feel this? We are permitted to have to make use of them to transcend into If we are hoping that, 'Will I have money?' 'Will I have, you know, worldly success?' Maybe. Maybe not. Do you have worldly success now? OK. Come here. [Q.4] Thank you, Guruji. something that's been with me that I feel like But it's more around this fear of survival. And yesterday, I could see that because something happened. And I remember what Prem said, I thought, 'Where is that [strong exhale] And then it came, because I've never known life without it. Like, I've never truly lived a life without this... [Mooji] Without what? fear of, maybe, not being taken care of. And I can see that it's an ego construct. It's really becoming quite clear that it has created this hyper-independence, also, that, 'Oh, I can do it myself'. Or like, when something comes like there's this feeling of, And I can see that because I'm surrounded by so much abundance. But inside, it's really robbing my life [Q.4] and it has done for a very long time. [Q.4] And you know I had these anxiety attacks, and I didn't realise that They would just come But through satsang, without the story of them. [Q.4] And it became easier when ... [M.] Let's start with this little thing now, about the anxiety attacks. Give me something, give me some The attacks are happening. Put some pictures, The attacks are actually happening, Just slow it down. Just look at your answers. The attacks are happening, of course, internally, about the thought that, [Q.4] I'm not entirely sure [Q.4] As, like I said, when I ... [Q.4] Yeah. [Q.4] There's no anxiety attacks now. But there is this underlying fear here, that's always here, [Mooji] So does it come spontaneously, or do you call it up, or some situation? [Q.4] The situation that usually happens [Q.4] is always to do with financial stuff. [Q.4] Or like what God's really doing. [Q.4] Recently, [Q.4] Like my rent goes up. [Q.4] My work dries up [Q.4] But I see it's necessary also, [Q.4] I'm like, 'I'm good, I'm good'. [Q.4] Like the satsang [Q.4] where you were talking about [Q.4] You said, 'You're drowning'. [Mooji] Are you and your mind Just let the question be asked. Take a moment. We're not in a hurry. Are you, your sense of who you are, Just take a moment. I don't want right answers. I want true, truly. You and your mind, OK. You, and your thoughts, and feelings, OK. So, the feelings and thoughts, They move, relative to the 'you', relative to the one you call yourself, the thoughts and feelings are the traffic The 'you' [Mooji taps his heart] Is the 'you' constant? Are you constantly, always, [Q.4] No. It's like a mix, [Q.4] It feels not constant. And if I sit ... [Q.4] Right now? [M.] Because there is a little trouble with reporting about something that was, But the now, in the now. Because now, So, what is your seeing? So, report of now. [Q.4] OK. So there's a lot of density [Q.4] which I'm able to observe. [Q.4] And I can't give you a total clear answer about that possession actually, because ... [Mooji] No. What was my question? Are you and your mind the same thing? Because we speak a lot about the mind, and all the information 'How I feel at the moment.' 'How I was and what I'd like things to be.' A lot of reports come from the mind. The one who is reporting about the mind, or you talk about your mind, [M.] are they the same thing? One thing? [Q.4] No it's not the same thing. [silence] [M.] Which is the one, the point from which The life, the senses and the mind, or the sense of the person? Which one we couldn't do ... So if you take one out, Which one could you take out? Of this trinity of my Self, my mind, and, say, my life. Which one can you take out [Q.4] If I take out my Self, [Mooji] Right. So the rest [Q.4] Yeah. [M.] It's everybody's question, by the way. [Q.4] I don't just want to give you ... [Q.4] Because I'd really like before I go. [M.] Isn't this person that you're referring to, [M.] as the, 'I really want to', [Mooji] Isn't that what the mind is saying? 'I really don't want to leave here with this, [Mooji] Isn't that also the mind? [Mooji] So, you are what? If you're seeing that whatever the mind, 'But you know, last week it was like this, I keep having these things and stuff', is that other than the mind? 'My life ... 'And every time I try to just sit, and really think about it, it just ...' [M.] Is that other than the mind? [Mooj] I'm going to put identity Can I? Can we go a little bit? [Q.4] Mind was always like thoughts but now it's like, OK, that's also mind. [Mooji] Is not the thinker of thought, Is the thinker stable? So would it hurt if I include as also a form of thought? 'How dare you!' No, is the thinker also a thought? Meaning something phenomenal Is the person also observable, or not? [Voice in group] Yes. It's observable. [M.] Only there? [Group] No. [Mooji] If it is observable, [Mooji] Is that personal? [Mooji] Madam? [Q.4] So you're telling me, [Mooji mimics preparing to fight] [Mooji] OK, come, come. [Q.4] The one that's thinking the thought [Mooji] Yes! [Mooji resumes fighting stance] [Mooji] Think about it. [laughter] [Mooji] On what basis can it be said that, On what credible basis can it be said that, [Voice in group] I can perceived it. [Mooji] It can be perceived. The person can be perceived. [Mooji] The biography you write, is it you? [M.] Is that person a constant? [M.] Nuisance. Sorry! Is it a constant? [Mooji] This person is a factor, this identity, who you take yourself to be, all of these are mind states, [Voices in group] Yes. [Voices in group] Yes. [Mooji] Observed by what? [Mooji] Known by what? [M.] No. Answers must not be theoretical. Answers must be direct! [Q.4] Guruji. What my question is, OK, That which is observing the mind senses and their play, is that the mind? You say, 'No'. OK, what is it? And I don't want What is it that knows this, that sees, but that's also the mind? Because even to come to this point is not normal in our world. 'What are you talking? I have a vote! I voted last week.' This one, is it constant? Is it a form of mind, Or is it kind of like a mind split? Where it's kind of the mind, and kind of something else? Yes, I would say that. I would say, everything is a part Everything! So, the mind, the ego, the devil, the life, it's all a part of something greater but itself is beyond all its play. The clue is the witnessing, If the person and its world, its history, its biography and autobiography are observable phenomenon, what is observing this? Can that be observed? And if it can be observed, by what? [silence] This class is an experiential environment. [Q.4] So you said, 'The thinker of the thoughts is also a thought. And if the thinker doesn't have any thoughts, the thinker could still be there, [Q.4] Like the identity could still be there ... [M.] Tell me a thought that is not there, that you're suffering from. [Mooji] Just in its absence. I won't tell it. [laughter] [Q.4] I don't ... [laughter] [Mooji] Just that? [Mooji] Only that? Maybe in the world of non-sense [Mooji] My question is still there. Do we have to revert to theory to address this question of mine? That if the mind ... Take a little time to get over the shock. Like, 'You mean, my person is also a thought?' Yes! 'Whose thought?' Oh, it is your sister's thought! 'You mean my existence is my sister's ...?' Whose is it? Whose thought is it? 'Oh it's God!' No, let's leave Him out of the picture. [M.] Whose thought is it? [M.] Something says, 'It's me!' 'Me' being what? We've got the person up on the screen now. 'Me' being what now? [Q.4] Because if there are no thoughts really, you're just perceiving without any distortion. [Mooji] Yes. You being what perceiving? [Mooji] Slow down. It's OK. These are existential questions, so I don't what to [Q.4] Well it's not someone who has a history. [Q.4] It's not loaded. It doesn't feel loaded. [Q.4] So, it just feels very natural. [M.] It feels very natural? [Mooji] Who is presenting this report? It, or something on behalf of it? [Q.4] Well ... [Q.4] 'It'. It feels like it. [M.] It feels like it to what? [Q.4] Because it doesn't ... It feels like it. I don't know ... [M.] Isn't the, 'I don't know', that in this moment, [M.] I'm sorry, we just have to go [M.] a tiny bit, but actually ... [Q.4] It doesn't have to report [Mooji] Right. Where is it? [M.] Where precisely is it? [Q.4] It doesn't have a location! [M.] Ah, sorry! I'm sorry to upset you like this. [Q.4] But there is a lot of ... There is a very beautiful vibration here, [M.] Yes. [M.] The seeing? [M.] Yes. [Mooji] Yes, you can observe the vibration [M.] Look, I can observe the flowers. You can observe the vibration from where? [Q.4] Well, I'm looking for that place. [Q.4] There's no place. There's no place. [Q.4] I can't tell you, 'Oh, it's back here'. [M.] Who can confirm as in co-ordinates of a place? [Q.4] Well, I'm saying it! [M.]Yes, as what? You are who? [Mooji] Which is your person? [Mooji] Ah, thank you. [Q.4] Just like that? [Mooji] Does it have a problem? [Q.4] It has no problems. [Mooji] Yes. [Mooji] Can something come out of there now, [Q.4] Nothing can come out because nothing ever came before, [Mooji] Yes. [Q.4] Nothing is added. [Q.4] It's not like that. [Mooji] Yes. It's like what? [M.] Choose your words carefully. [Q.4] You know, but I'm going to try, OK? [laughter] [Q.4] It feel so pure that ... It just feels so true. [Mooji] Yes. What is seeing this? [Q.4] It is seeing from itself. [Q.4] It knows itself. [Mooji] Any problems? [Mooji] OK. I only want to talk to it. When it has a problem, you tell me. [Q.4] I'm so happy to talk to you. [laughter] [M.] Very good. Very good. [Q.4] It's nice to talk to you [laughter] [Mooji] Are we going back down that road? The sense of a problem is not something ... Yes, they can play like normal stuff. You know, interrelationship or activity based in the field of comings and goings. 'My back is hurting.' 'Wow, I need to eat something.' All of these can be there. It's fine. But it's not the same place When seen in the light of this, somehow it seems a paradox, And what knows this? It's It and it has no problem, something to do with a problem and the body, that can be seen for now. And if there was one answer where would it come from? From the field of the diversity, Where would a true response come from? OK. OK. [silence] Sorry. Somebody has a problem here? Do you have a problem you want to share? [M.] You don't have? You have a problem? [laughter] A survivor. Come. [Q.5] It's coming through the satsang, that I kind of lost something. Something changed for me And I really ... I really cannot answer the questions so fast. [Mooji] Oh good. That's good. That's fine. [Q.5] There's a part which I can observe, which is really sad about it Because it's new, there is a fear, if it is going inside, I think. [M.] Is there not a space, from which you say, Which I take. Fine, fine, fine. Is there not a space, let's call it a space, where speed doesn't matter? Like, it doesn't have something to sort out? [Q.5] It is and I can see it. It's a character and it doesn't trust it. [Mooji] Yes. The character doesn't trust it? [M.] OK, which was the first, which was there from before, the character or this place? [Mooji] Which was first, Do you understand what I mean by presence? The sense of being. [Q.5] It's always the presence. [M.] So the person is born from the presence? [M.] And the person doesn't trust [Q.5] Yes. [laughing] [M.] It has good cause? It has reason to? We are in court. Does the person have authentic reason to not trust its parent? [Q.5] I'm getting stuck. but not through the heart. [M.] Yes. What is reporting this, [Q.5] Both. [M.] Ah, the head and the heart are reporting. So the heart is complaining [Q.5] Now I lost it again. [laughs] [M.] No, I'm really up for simplicity. Simplicity works for me. The most simple. What's the most simple we can be, What's the most simple we can be What do you need, absolutely, to be? Let's try that one. Without which I am not. What is needed? [silence] I'll help you a little bit. No oxygen, no body, OK? Does the Beingness breathe? [Q.5] No. [M.] Unusual question. [M.] Is it a fair question? [M.] Do you have the capacity [Group] Yes. [M.] You're not sure. [Q.5] I need to sit with those things much more. [Q.5] It feels like ... [Q.5] Yes. [M.] What are you doing about the breathing? [M.] So whether you're attentive [M.] it's just kind of happening. [M.] You see it there all the time. which is more constant [Q.5] Yeah, I mean that I see that I am here. [M.] You see that you are here. [Q.5] It's just ... [Q.5] Myself. [M.] You're always here as yourself. [Mooji] Yourself being what? [Q.5] There are no words for it. Presence? [M.] There is no word for it. [Q.5] Never. [M.] Never! OK. But we have to ... [M.] Yes? 'But' .. [Mooji] A very important word, 'But ...' [Q.5] I feel than from 'the now', right now. [M.] Right. [M.] then you can say, [Q.5] Yes. [Q.5] I don't trust memory, anymore. [M.] You don't trust the memory, anymore. [M.] Do you trust the Beingness? [Mooji] Can I hear [silence] [M.] If I can have an unreliable witness which should I choose? You, yourself, said Do you trust the Beingness? Can we hear what the Beingness has to say? Is this word games? [Voices in group] No. [Q.5] There is just ... [M.] There's no feeling? [M.] Internal feeling. [Q.5] I don't know. [M.] Yes. OK. [Mooji] OK. Did it bring you here and leave you? [Q.5] No. [Q.5] Thank you. [M.] Can it separate from you? [Mooji] No. What's the problem? [Q.5] I need to sit with it. [Q.5] I need to sit with this. [Mooji] I very much recommend this, [M.] I'm good. We are good for now? We're good for now? If there was never another satsang after this, [M.] Because these things are possible, no? I'm not threatening, but if there wasn't ... Are we putting something Or is there something that needs a next time? [Voices in group] No. [Mooji] So, if it doesn't need a next time, what time is it then? [Voices in group] It's here. [Mooji] Is it 'now' for the time being? [Voice in group] No, it's now, for always. [M.] You see, the thing is that There is a looking, a refining. I don't ask anyone Just somehow, in looking, just ordering itself, somehow. You don't have to go out You're just only asking, in this place, no matter from any dimension, Yet nothing sticks. Can anyone see? Nothing sticks. OK, nothing sticks. Is this space imagined? [Voices in group] No. [Mooji] No. OK. Is it looking to be left alone which is seemingly chaotic This space that Is, is it hoping for, or working towards suppressing or destroying, [Voices in group] No. [Mooji] Does it mean [Voice in group] No. Or it means that [Voice in group] I don't know. [M.] Well, if you wanted to, and you need to go for a pee, But it's a choice, no? Or generally, you feel, 'I need to go'. OK? So it doesn't matter To feel comfortable. Is it wrong to say, 'No, I'll just poo myself'? Hunger comes and the need to eat. You may say, 'I am taking care of it'. Yes, in a way, a great feeling of 'I' We will need more reflection. We don't need more truth. We need more reflection that are disturbing your natural peace. Remember, I'm not saying you can create peace. Like sickness means, It obstructs the health. So you don't have to create that state. The organism is, by nature, Whatever, no? I don't know Thank you, everyone. We are good? [M.] We're good for the moment? OK. Thank you, those who are joining. They are joining via broadcasting I hope this has been, [these] words, of more deeper introspective value And to that extent, I would count it as being a profoundly practical opportunity. Because to learn something to learn and keep information, it's not knowledge and it is not realisation. But it's the beginning of it. We have some model, Applied introspection, applied like this, it transforms the raw material of information Yes, it harmonises and it reveals And to that extent, our lives shine and joy and wisdom. [silence] Thank you. Very good. Very good. Very good. [Mooji] Satsang is not merely nor to suffer them, of course not! I mean it's not like having fun But setting it free You are never not free. As a person, it's debatable. And all the entrapments of personhood are to serve the awakening process. To reawaken to our original nature. It's not that the universe I would even say, Can I say like that? It's its baby. It loves it also. OK, but the whole point is not just to It has to wake up. [Questioner 6] Guruji, is it OK [Mooji] Sir, they want to hear. [Q.6] Is it OK that, [Q.6] I can be in this state of Mount Ego? [Q.6] Alive but sleeping? [M.] The whole purpose of satsang, is for you to awaken to that which you are, never sleeping. To that which is never sleeping. It was never dead. It was never not there. And each one is kept alive by it because it is the cause of your breathing. It makes it that you are sleeping; It still has the capacity to discern, to feel joy, and love and empathy. All of these things. It gives the capacity for them, you see. But if it gets distorted or takes itself to be something else, then all kinds of sickness, or faulty perception, any movement of hatred or selfishness, or arrogance or any of this is a form of sickness, spiritual sickness, for everybody, right across the planet. I don't know if there is anyone We all have to go through the sickness. It's all part of the play through evolution. So, it needs to be corrected to say, 'Yes, I am ignorant'. Yes, there is ignorance for the moment. The ignorance is covering something. But the thing it's covering And it's profoundly important because it even creates and supports ignorance to be there for a bit, Does that make sense at all? Yes it keeps something ... I remember, some time ago in India, And a man came to me and said, on this point, I'm remembering, he said, 'For a long time, But at a certain point, I started to be very, very shy. And now, I have to go out with my friends and I'm always behind them. They do ... They are sociable. They all have partners, but I'm too shy.' And he asked, 'Please could you help me So my response, is not an universal response; Because I found myself saying, Sometimes the Source keeps you shy. Because if you were not shy, We don't know. You may be full of ... It can hold back something And then, when sufficient, But he wasn't so happy with that. He wanted to be able to go out And of course, at an Earthly, we want to help each other like that. But sometimes it's not what you need, actually. But who is to know what you need? It can only come from intuition. And so sometimes, You say, maybe some inhibition is there But also, whatever it is that also brought you here. It's amazing how it works. But I just try and invite you to open up that nothing in the universe Except the replay It has to play out. Some dormant, some latent tendencies they keep bearing for both one's self and others as well. And we are here to settle that account. Life gives all the opportunities. No human being It is inherent in life to bring to you the kind of challenges and even the attacks, or even fights and stuff, to somehow educate back towards here. That's why I was saying to trust it. Don't just trust things that feel good We can taste all kinds of things. We have to go through them, And not necessarily past them that way, So you know, don't keep any tight definitions It's strangling. You don't need to have because actually you are concept-free. In the Beingness, you are concept-free. Concept free is universal. Very relatable. In any direction it's relatable. But when we have strong human conditioning, where we become very conditioned. You like what you think looks like you ... But life has made it that way. Many things that don't look like you For us all, it's like this. So I said, Yes. Everything for a while. Nothing for you And so, like when we met I already felt this warmth and some humility. Where did that come from? You see, who can tell? Anybody who comes to satsang, it's like part of your destiny It may not keep you in satsang. It doesn't mean it was wrong to come. You may come and find that The vasanas are trying to get you, You may have to go off for a while If your soul is not mature enough It's still OK. You're still under the umbrella So you go off for a bit, 'I was really wanting this taste. You can put it down So some beings, are going like this, and like this, and then a little bit ... Some are sort of [indicates sinking] And some are like ... [going round and up] [laughter] But nothing is so predictable. Nobody can tell you, But still the will of God And you're going to make use of that, It's so absolutely wise, you see. You can't study Him. and your sitting. Simple things. 'How can I do all those things Everything comes right. You see? [Q.6] Thank you that we can be with you. [Mooji] Thank you that I can be with you, too. We can be like this. [Questioner 7] Guruji, [Q.7] I just wanted to thank you ['Gem of the Week' videos] [Q.7] Speaking about receding from the vasanas, I realised that with the vasanas, [Q.7] I was trying to push them away. [Q.7] And in receding, I came more to the Self. [Q.7] And less to the person who was pushing. [M.] Yes. So you recede, also, from the person. ... It's obvious. Simple ways, you see. And, in the world, And for a while you may be attracted to them. And it is fine! Everything has its time. But if you come into an environment like this, then this is what we point out, Taste and see. Yes? Thank you. Very good. Thank you. [silence] [Voice in group] I love you, Guruji. [Mooji] I love you, too. It's all love. Love is doing everything. [silence] [Mooji] It's love. Love is doing everything. It's the one playing all the mistakes, I, somehow, see it. And then finding its way and sitting in its own heart and going, 'Ha, ha'. I don't want to fragment and say, Yes, there's a place for that. Some moments when we can use but in a holistic way. It's all done by the universal consciousness. It's all the play of God. Every part of it. [Questioner 8] You are the Master. [Q.8] You are the truth [Mooji] Yes. Maybe so. Copyright 2024 Mooji Media Ltd.
