Hello everyone! This is YUGO from THE KYOTO! Today, we're at Sanzen-in Temple! The reason I came to Sanzen-in is because there were comments on YouTube asking me to visit Sanzen-in Temple! Today is Thursday, November 28th. This isn't Sanzen-in Temple yet; this is the approach to Sanzen-in Temple... It's the path leading to Sanzen-in, but even on the approach to Sanzen-in, there are incredibly beautiful maple leaves. Aren't these orange ones incredibly beautiful? Too beautiful If the approach is this beautiful, I'm excited to see how beautiful Sanzen-in Temple itself will be. But still, the maple leaves at Sanzen-in are yellow and brown, and falling... Many of the maple leaves are sadly falling. Really, something is wrong with Kyoto this year... I feel like something is off. The maple leaf tunnel is also incredibly beautiful. With a stream flowing alongside... while watching the maple leaves... you can hear the sound of the river. And it's incredibly relaxing. Isn't Sanzen-in incredibly beautiful? It's definitely in its prime right now. If you're planning to visit Sanzen-in Temple, hurry! I think a week from now, many of the leaves will have fallen... I think it's best to go now. I think they'll start falling around early December. Beautiful Incredibly, incredibly beautiful! The red maple leaves are also starting to fall. Incredibly beautiful We're still on the mountain path. This isn't Sanzen-in yet. I wonder just how beautiful Sanzen-in will be. You can get to Sanzen-in from Kyoto Station by a single bus ride for 680 yen or 630 yen... ...It's a direct route; you just get on the bus at Kyoto Station... ...and the bus terminal is Sanzen-in, so... ...you just need to stay on the bus until the end, so there's no risk of oversleeping... ...it's really easy to get there. But, the distance is quite... ...long, so from Kyoto Station to Sanzen-in... ...it takes about an hour and 40 minutes by bus, I think. So... ...for those who are going by bus, it might be a bit tough. Beautiful, this... ...feeling of sunlight coming in is incredibly beautiful. There's someone taking pictures with the same camera. It's beautiful... Wow! Incredibly beautiful! Amazing! Everyone, can you see the maple leaf in the center of the screen? It's incredibly beautiful. Too beautiful! Burning... ...red. The wind is crazy. Don't fall yet! Hold on for another week! It's beautiful. Sanzen-in must be even more beautiful, right? We've arrived at the entrance to Sanzen-in. Even the entrance is beautiful, but the leaves are starting to fall. Sanzen-in is at its peak right now. If it stays like this for a week... it'll probably be quite scattered. There are also snack shops. It seems you can also eat soba noodles next door. Let's go in then. The weather is also amazing. Perfect Sanzen-in weather. The wind is very strong, so it's cold, though. These beautiful... beautiful maple leaves... are mitarashi dango. They look delicious. Four for 600 yen... a little expensive. It seems to be like this. Looks delicious. There are a lot of shops. Sanzen-in's precincts. I guess it was written by people from long ago. This is the entrance. Let's go in. Maple Festival. It's until today. November 28th. Oh no. Everyone. Oh no. It's until today. Please watch this before I upload the video. That's impossible, is it? Will there be no maple leaves from tomorrow onwards? No, that can't be the case. No, it absolutely should still be on tomorrow and after. Probably. Should we ask at the reception? Is this until today? Will I not be able to see the autumn leaves from tomorrow onwards? Is that so? So I can still see the autumn leaves from tomorrow onwards? I see. It seems you can still see the autumn leaves from tomorrow onwards. We're taking off our shoes. It seems photography is not allowed inside the buildings of Sanzen-in Temple, but it's okay to take pictures in the garden. So let's... first show you this beautiful garden. There are also quite a few beautifully bright red maple leaves... further in, so we'll go there later. This garden is also amazing... It's so calming. What do you think, everyone? This is incredibly beautiful. These maple leaves would normally turn bright red, but I think this year they will probably fall while remaining this color. That's a shame. The ones further in are quite beautifully colored, an orange hue. Photography is prohibited in this building, so I'll skip ahead to the next location. There was a garden here as well. There aren't any maple leaves here, but... these two streams of water are incredibly soothing, wouldn't you say? It's incredibly beautiful. It's so beautiful. We've left the building. It's incredibly beautiful, beautiful from the moment we leave. Isn't it gorgeous? These colored maple leaves are definitely at their peak right now. I checked at the reception desk, but... even though the maple leaf festival ends today, that doesn't mean you can't see the maple leaves; you can still see them perfectly. I think it's probably because the exhibits... inside the building are only open until today. The old man at the reception desk didn't give me much detail. Anyway, it seems you can still come here tomorrow, so let's go take a look. The sunlight makes it so beautiful. That forest... ...in the depths of the forest, you can see... ...it shining gold! Look! It's shining gold, it's completely golden! It's too beautiful! There are... ...a lot of maple leaves. Beautiful, but they're starting to fall. The wind is too strong, they're falling a lot. Anyone coming to Josai-in Temple, please hurry! Josai-in Temple last year... ...the video I shot actually has the most views in THE KYOTO history... ...I think it got around 100,000 views. But I can understand it getting 100,000 views. It's too beautiful. Many people may have gotten to know me through this Josai-in Temple video. It's good, really. It's really beautiful. Which way should I go around? Which way should I go? This way, this way. This is it, the maple leaves that shone golden earlier. Who threw away the bag? The maple leaves are reflected in the pond. You can all see it, right? The yellow and red maple leaves are reflected in the pond... ...on the surface of the water. Too beautiful. By the way, Josai-in Temple is 700 yen for adults. It's not 700 yen quality. Really... ...it's too beautiful. This is good. One more time, one more time, the maple leaves reflected on the water surface. It's beautiful. A beautiful theme park for 700 yen! Isn't it too beautiful? And since there are people over there, there must be a path leading to that area! I'll go around everything today! Yeah, there are a lot of people from Taiwan here. Surprisingly few people who look American... ...and more people from China and other Asian countries. That's my impression. As usual, there aren't many Japanese people here. There are really no Japanese people. Going all the way around brings me back to where I was before. This angle is the best, isn't it? What is this? Seriously. Right? This is amazing. Okay, okay, okay, I have to go around everything. I don't have time to take it slow. There's a building behind me, where my camera is pointed right now... ...but photography is prohibited there, so I won't film it. Everyone, please pay 700 yen to visit Sanzen-in... ...and see the inside of the building. The inside was also incredibly amazing. I truly felt the history. Sanzen-in is amazing! I came here once last year, but I haven't been back since. I had completely forgotten about it. This place is so beautiful. Warabe Jizo (child Jizo statues). Ultimately, this is what feels truly Japanese. This is nice. Fudo Myoo statue ahead Aren't Japanese kanji characters too difficult? I really can't read them at all. Even without reading them, I can somehow understand the meaning, so I gave up on reading them. Can you read this? I read it as &quot;Ugasin&quot;. But apparently it's &quot;Oon Ugaya Jayagyarabayesowaka&quot;. I have no idea. Using the wheelchair accessible path... I'd like to film the previous location... from above. I think I will. Can you all see? Oh! It's a little hidden by the trees... hidden by the trees. I'm filming it now, everyone... Wow! Beautiful... Too beautiful! This is too beautiful. Really. This is seriously amazing. These beautiful... maple leaves are within reach. maple leaves Can you all see the pond? I can film the place I just walked through... from above. Too beautiful! This is seriously amazing. And right in front of me is a bright red and beautiful... maple leaf. It's truly bright red. Extremely beautiful. For those coming to Sanzen-in, it's peak season now! Ah, this is beautiful too. It's the best time to visit now, so don't wait until next week or the week after... Come today, tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow! It's truly beautiful. Actually, Sanzen-in is way too big! This is totally worth the 1000 yen entrance fee... no question! Maintaining this garden must be incredibly difficult. What is that... orange color? It's unbelievably beautiful... amazing! I'm surrounded by beautiful maple leaves... it's too beautiful! Oh no, I seem to be walking the wrong way. Since I'm here, I'll walk down this path... Looking up, I see beautiful maple leaves. Please, everyone, come this week! Today is Thursday, so come this Friday, Saturday, or Sunday! Please, everyone! It's the best time to see them now, they're just starting to fall. I want to go over there too, but I'll go this way for now. This way is more beautiful. Isn't it nice? Someone's pointing a camera! Could this be amazing?! Here! Wow! It's incredibly beautiful. Excuse me. Isn't it beautiful? Can you hear the sound of the river? Please relax, everyone. The sun is shining, and that side is becoming incredibly beautiful. Amazing, it's about five times more beautiful than a moment ago. Around here, the leaves are starting to fall. Look, just a little... They're starting to fall, aren't they? Oh my... People all over the world, are you watching?! This beautiful Kyoto autumn foliage! Please come to Japan! Kyoto is truly incredibly beautiful right now! Only during this period once a year! The leaves turn red like this... ...and become beautiful. Please, everyone in the world, come to Kyoto! What do you think? I really have to thank the person who created Sanzen-in. A happy time... ...like me, there are probably many people... ...who are happy all over the world. The person who built Sanzen-in is amazing for creating this! If I were Prime Minister... ...I'd want to give them some kind of award. This angle is amazing. Isn't it incredibly beautiful? Everyone, do you have a place like this? In your life... ...on the path you walk every day, is there such a beautiful place? I don't. It seems that Fudo Myoo is enshrined here. Nice. Could it be, plum blossoms? Plum blossoms... Are these plum blossoms? The plum blossoms are starting to bloom! Everyone, look at this... The plum blossoms are starting to bloom! The autumn leaves and plum blossoms coexist! What a fantastic sight! I'm speechless! It's true, but plum blossoms usually bloom around December... that's what it's like every year. This year was a bit warmer, so maybe they bloomed early. Those maple leaves are also incredibly beautiful. I wonder about that Fudo Myoo statue... I bought a ticket, so I'll properly look at the Fudo Myoo statue... and then go home. I don't think it's allowed to film it, so if you all want to see the Fudo Myoo statue, please... come visit this place. Amazing! I feel like I'm getting moved every 30 seconds. It's too beautiful. They were from China. I love people from China. People from Taiwan and Hong Kong are somehow... so kind. I travel quite a bit, you know. When I went to Taiwan the other day, they gave me extra soup dumplings. It looks like a hydrangea garden. For those overseas viewers who don't know what hydrangeas are, they are... ...flowers that bloom during the rainy season. I highly recommend looking them up. They bloom during the rainy season in Japan... ...which is around June. Around May or June, somewhere around there. It's a blooming flower, and it's also colorful and beautiful. Now, it's preparing to bloom next year... by putting out leaves like this. Hydrangeas are also beautiful. Please, everyone, don't just see the autumn leaves, but also the hydrangeas... Come and see them. Beautiful. It's beautiful... This is the spot where I was quite moved a while ago. Let's go back. Have we gone around everything? Oh, there's a statue. I wonder who that is. Sanzen-in Temple has proper restrooms. Something like Kiyomizu-dera Temple has... women's restrooms... that are crowded. But Sanzen-in Temple's restrooms aren't very crowded. There's a path... I wonder how to get there? I think we've seen enough of this area... so I'd like to go to the next zone. Isn't it amazing how the maple leaves have fallen on the moss? Green and red, and brown and yellow... This collaboration is the best. This gate is nice too... It feels very Japanese. It's bright red. It seems like you can get a Goshuin stamp here... If we go this way, it'll be the exit. This is insane! Beautiful. Incredibly beautiful. It's amazing. Restrooms. Those were the restrooms. Wow, it's so beautiful. These maple leaves are truly beautiful. Too beautiful. Why is this so beautiful? It's amazing. It's lovely. Really. This is so beautiful. &quot;So beautiful&quot; in English is &quot;so beautiful&quot;. In Kansai-ben dialect, &quot;so beautiful&quot; is &quot;Meccha kirei yan&quot;. I want to get closer. I can see the souvenir shop area I just passed through. Too beautiful. Everyone, please come to Sanzen-in Temple. It's unbelievably amazing! Please come this Friday, Saturday, or Sunday! If you come after December starts, it might be quite scattered, I think. I don't know for sure though. It's unbelievably beautiful. It's too amazing. This is 700 yen. Really. Unbelievable, right? Ohhhhhhh! It's beautiful. And everyone, look at these stairs. It's still a little messy, but... maybe that's because it's been cleaned. Like this, you see, the white stairs... and the red maple leaves. Falling down, it gives you a little... seasonal feeling. It's lovely, isn't it? It was really great, Sanzen-in. Sanzen-in was the best! Please, everyone, come to Sanzen-in. You'll be moved. This is definitely not 700 yen quality. Well, I'd like to end today's video here!
