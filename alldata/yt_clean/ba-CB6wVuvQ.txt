Hi, I'm Michael. This is Lessons from the Screenplay. From the first shots of Whiplash and Black their respective disciplines. Andrew Neiman practicing the drums, Nina Sayers Both of these films bring us behind the scenes Both were relatively low-budget, leaned heavily great performances. But most importantly, both of these films who must first endure suffering and sacrifice. But how do they tell this story? There are plenty of variations between them... ...jazz drummer and ballerina, gender expectations, which give each film a unique personality. But today, I want to focus on the structural To examine the elements used to tell the story And how their arrangement determines the fate Let's take a look at Whiplash and Black Swan. Act 1: Inciting Incident, Desire, and Dramatic Every story has its first turning point. The moment at which the protagonist can no on their journey. This turning point is called the inciting An inciting incident creates a specific desire path to change. In Whiplash it happens very early, on the &quot;I'm sorry.&quot; &quot;No, stay.&quot; ...with a chance encounter with Fletcher &quot;You know who I am?&quot; &quot;Yes, sir.&quot; &quot;So you know I'm looking for players?&quot; &quot;Yes, sir.&quot; &quot;Then why did you stop playing?&quot; Andrew gets the tiniest taste of attention in Studio Band--the best of the best at Shaffer. In Black Swan the inciting incident comes company will be performing Swan Lake this &quot;A new production needs a new Swan Queen.&quot; &quot;A fresh face to present to the world.&quot; Nina wants to be chosen as the new Swan Queen. But as an audience, we only care about the at stake. When we understand their fears. Both screenplays use the characters' home Nina's mother is a former ballerina who She refuses to let Nina grow up, surrounding Andrew's father is a moderately successful &quot;Mild-mannered, soft-spoken, average in every &quot;Has the eyes of a former dreamer.&quot; For Andrew and Nina, their parents represent and will come to despise. So now that we know what the protagonists desires. But they can't just walk up and take their This is where the mentors come in. They both wield absolute power, holding the &quot;May I?&quot; And most importantly, they give the protagonists &quot;Not so controlled!&quot; &quot;Seduce us!&quot; &quot;Not just the Prince, but the court, the audience, C'mon!&quot; "Double-time swing.&quot; &quot;No, double-time.&quot; &quot;Double it.&quot; &quot;Faster.&quot; &quot;Faster!&quot; The mentors introduce the dramatic question Will Andrew be able to push himself to play himself to being the greatest? Will Nina be able to stop worrying about precision, the Black Swan? So driven by desire and fear, they each practice and more importantly, take their first Andrew asks out the girl he's had a crush &quot;Would you want to go out with me?&quot; ...and Nina goes to Brennan's office to These actions signal that they're ready to start Brennan gives Nina the part of Swan Queen. &quot;Drums, with me.&quot; And when Fletcher auditions players, Andrew &quot;No, no, other drums.&quot; They've each had their first victory, and But little do they know, this was the easy The real challenge is still to come. Act 2: Struggle And Sacrifice The second act of a screenplay is where the and in doing so are forced to change in a Both Nina and Andrew are being held back by They begin to change, but take it too far, of self-destruction. A key motivating factor that both films share In a scene not in the final film, Fletcher testing the Nassau Band. Specifically mentioning to have his double-time Thus, Andrew first ascends to Studio Band But what goes around comes around, and to brings Ryan into Studio Band. &quot;Am I late?&quot; Suddenly, Andrew's newly-secured spot is &quot;Look, I can play these charts.&quot; &quot;Now is not the time.&quot; &quot;I can play it, okay?&quot; &quot;I said NOT NOW!&quot; &quot;If you want the fucking part, earn it.&quot; In Black Swan, the threat of replacement takes Lily is the new girl, and everything Nina The screenplay describes Nina's dancing &quot;Although her movement is incredibly precise, &quot;Exactly as the White Swan should be: fear And Lily's dancing: &quot;...is explosive, exudes sex.&quot; Lily embodies the persona she must adopt. The Black Swan. As Nina struggles to dance the Black Swan, For both Nina and Andrew, the Threat of Replacement important element of Act 2. Descent into Madness. In Black Swan, Nina begins to go crazy. She starts seeing a double. First in a passerby, then in mirrors, then The personification of her doubt, fear, and Andrew's is a slow descent into madness, The main force of antagonism is Fletcher. From the first day of Studio Band, Fletcher are, while being violent and abusive. &quot;Count again.&quot; &quot;1, 2, 3, 4--&quot; &quot;1, 2, 3, 4--&quot; &quot;Rushing or dragging?&quot; &quot;Rushing&quot; &quot;So you do know the difference!&quot; Overwhelmed by the pressure and torment, they Andrew breaks up with his girlfriend, is rude starts taking pills. Nina disobeys her mother by going out with out with strangers, and hallucinating having As they approach the end of act 2, both protagonists of control. Nina's madness crescendos when she maybe-murders her most vivid transformation into a swan And as Andrew scrambles to get to their second self-destruction. The Descent into Madness shows how can be taken too far. &quot;You're done.&quot; But here at the end of Act 2, there is a to setting up their endings. Andrew's car crash forces him to stop his And it's coupled with the revelation that Fletcher has committed suicide. Nina encounters a similar warning, when the replaced -- tries to kill herself. But the difference is that in Nina's story what the pursuit of greatness can do to you. So the warning goes unheeded -- an important Thus, Andrew's descent into madness is brought And her pinnacle of self-destruction lays Act 3: Transformation And Perfection The climax of both stories takes place during The stakes are high. Mentally, the characters are in two very different Because Andrew was forced to take a break from drumming, he's had time to gain some perspective. Nina, on the other hand, has just reached keeping it together. But despite these differences, both Nina and They're not ready. There is still a piece of their old selves Andrew is still playing for Fletcher, trusting set him up to fail. &quot;You think I'm fucking stupid?&quot; &quot;What?&quot; &quot;I know it was you.&quot; Nina still doubts herself. And after seeing Lily flirting with the dancer belongs to the White Swan--Nina's double And so as Nina and Andrew have the first taste &quot;Nina freaks, jerking her body.&quot; &quot;David's grip SLIPS.&quot; &quot;And Nina SLAMS onto the stage.&quot; &quot;It's a horrific moment that feels like &quot;On Fletcher's face, the look of a victor...&quot; &quot;As he turns back to the audience we hear...&quot; &quot;...a smattering of polite, muted applause, &quot;Quiet, half-hearted, pitiful.&quot; &quot;No one here has ever seen a disaster quite Faced with this ultimate failure, the characters their journey. Andrew turns around and walks back on stage. &quot;...before Fletcher can even turn back around into double-time Latin.&quot; Andrew isn't playing for Fletcher anymore, He's confident and in control. Meanwhile, Nina returns to her dressing room &quot;How about...I dance the Black Swan for you?&quot; Nina attacks her double, who fights back, &quot;It's my turn!&quot; &quot;My turn.&quot; Until Nina is finally pushed to finish her "It's MY turn!" Both protagonists have destroyed their The stories answer their dramatic questions of their lives. &quot;It is time for the Coda.&quot; &quot;She takes a brief pause, closing her eyes &quot;She spins with ferocity.&quot; &quot;More BLACK FEATHERS burst out from her shoulders and back.&quot; &quot;At last, she truly embodies the Black Swan.&quot; &quot;The audience looks on, mesmerized. &quot;Too stunned to clap at first.&quot; &quot;I will gouge out your mother-fucking eyes.&quot; &quot;Fletcher's words only seem to strengthen &quot;The band roars into overdrive, the brass &quot;Fletcher steps back.&quot; &quot;Andrew just keeps looking straight ahead &quot;Unafraid now.&quot; &quot;A machine.&quot; The storytelling during the finale of Whiplash After Andrew seizes control, Fletcher's &quot;...his face now says one thing and one thing And moments later: &quot;Fletcher almost smiles.&quot; &quot;Was this his plan all along...?&quot; Then, Fletcher goes from defeated opponent &quot;Fletcher stands there, nodding, focused, &quot;Waves his hand, pushing Andrew on...&quot; Here, at the end, both films diverge one final Nina returns to her dressing room and discovers but instead mortally wounded herself. Her un-disrupted madness has lead to the ultimate But the show must go on, and Nina returns White Swan. Nina's mentor has a line that didn't make to the emotion of both finales. He's talking about dance, but I think it He says: &quot;What we do is beautiful, but fleeting.&quot; &quot;Dance is not immortalized like music, poetry &quot;It doesn't grow old in museums and churches.&quot;&quot; &quot;It lives for now.&quot; &quot;For this moment only.&quot; &quot;And this is your moment.&quot; Nina and Andrew look into the crowd. The audience is theirs. Their parents watch, astounded. This is their moment. Black Swan and Whiplash use similar story In doing so, they each express their own variation Black Swan tells the story of a young woman fleeting moment of absolute perfection... ...suggesting &quot;absolute perfection requires Whiplash tells the story of a young man who from a mentor, but manages to grow from the &quot;...the next Buddy Rich, the next Charlie Which raises the questions: Do the ends justify Is it true that... &quot;There are no two words more harmful in the Comparing stories can reveal the common elements elements can be used.
