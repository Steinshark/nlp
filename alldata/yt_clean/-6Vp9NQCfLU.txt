hi everyone in this video I'm going to show you how to configure DHCP in a switch okay and for this I'm going to use a layer two switch this video is going to be very very interesting for beginners so make sure to watch it till the end so for configuring DCP I have taken one switch and here I am going to take 10 computers this is five computers and here I have five computers and what I want this five computers belongs to One Network and these five computers belongs to another network and on both the network I'm going to assign different ranges of IP address now let me connect the cables to the port of the switch and the PC so this is a simple scenario okay now see in switch Port we cannot assign a IP address that is the main thing then how we can configure DHCP let me show you the live example okay so let's go to the command line interface enable the privileg mode go to Global configuration mode now here first of all we have to configure V okay that is called virtual l so I'm going to create V number 10 hit enter exit let's create another V by the name vill number 20 hit enter exit now next step is I'm going to assign the port to this villain so the first five ports you are able to see right this is Port it number is f is 0 by 1 to F is 0x 5 right so let's select all the port together the command is in NT F a0 by1 that is a first Port of the switch give hyphen and then typee five hit enter oh sorry now here before that I have to type the command called range okay I NT range and then this is the first port to five port hit enter so as you can see all the five ports are selected now I'm going to assign all of this five port to One V that is called V number 10 for this command is switch Port access V number 10 hit enter right exit now the remaining five ports you are able to see here this port starts from F a06 and here you can see f010 so let's run the same command int range F a06 to F a010 right hit enter I want to assign this port to which villain villain number 20 that we have already created here enter now exit so what we have did we have created two virtual L villain number 10 villain number 20 we have assign the first port to the villain number 10 this first five ports to villain number 10 and the another five ports from 6 to 10 we have assigned it to the villain number 20 all right now see switch do not have any port where we can assign the IP address so for this reason we're going to create a virtual interface virtual interface means a interface that is logically available but not physically we're telling switch that just assume that there is a port available where I am assigning the IP address okay the command for creating a virtual interface is int villain just give the villain name so we have created villain number 10 so let's enter vill number 10 and hit enter and as you can see the port is up now and here I can assign the IP address normally how we assign the IP address follow the same steps so this network I'm going to assign the IP address as 10.0.1 assign the sub mask 255.0.0.0 hit enter run the command no Shir hit enter next is let's select the another virtual interface in ven this time I'm going to select interface number 20 the time you create the time you enter the command in V 20 means it is going to create a virtual interface by the name 20 okay now same like this here I'm going to assign the IP address as 20.0.0 do1 and here is a submit mask that is default subit Mark 255.0.0.0 hit enter run the command no shot to enable the port okay just too easy to remember so let me type here so this network able to see here it's belongs to 10.0.0.0 /8 and the another Network belongs to 20. 0.0.0 /8 all right so all the default configuration is done now whatever configuration you do for configuring DHCP you have to follow the same normal steps so let's go back to configuration mode now what is the command for DHCP run the command IP DHCP pool give the pool name as a now here I'm going to type Network this pool belong to which network first of all this network right it is 10.0.0.0 give the subnet mask 255.0.0.0 hit enter now here to enter the default gateway right the command is just enter default and give the gateway gateway means which Gateway tell me here we have to enter the Gateway of this right virtual interface number 10 we have created virtual interface 10 so this is going to act as a Gateway so what is the IP address of this interface it is 10. 0.0.1 so for this network default gateway will be 10.0.0 do1 hit enter done exit now next is I'm going to create another DHCP pool that is for another Network let's give the pool name as B hit enter now this pool belongs to which network this network that is 20.0.0 so let's type here Network 20.0.0 submit mark 255.0.0.0 hit enter and it default gateway will be what the port number of second interface that is second virtual interface that we have created that is 20. 0.0.1 right so let's enter default gateway as 20. 0.0.1 hit enter let's click on exit that's it so finally we have configure DHCP on a switch pull means creating a group of IP address so in pool a whatever devices you are able to see here they're going to get IP address from this network that will starts from 10.0.0.0 and all the five computers you are able to see on the second Network that is we have created pool B right so all of this computer going to get IP address from this range that starts from 20. 0.0.0 now let's go back to the computer and do the live practical so for example I'm selecting the first computer go to desktop IP configuration and here I'm going to select DHCP and here you can see I am I'm getting the IP address 10. 0.0.2 same like this if I choose this second computer here also you will get the same let's go to DHCP here it should get the next IP address that is 10. 0.0.3 are you able to see guys all the computers you able to see in the first Network are going to receive IP address from the first DHCP pool okay now this five computer able to see here they are going to receive IP address from which network from 20 Network let's see uh let's go to desktop IP configuration DHCP and here you can see I'm receiving IP address from 20.0.0 networks so like this you can configure DHCP on a switch I hope you have found this video helpful for complete cisos course you can follow the link given in the description section below and I will see you inside the course thanks for watching
