A boy who burns from the atomic bomb "My father said that it's him" &quot;I've loved my husband. He was very kind.&quot; Is the boy in the photo really his father? &quot;The only information we have is that he is being treated in a hospital.&quot; &quot;I thought there's no way to know for sure.&quot; The Truth We Revealed is... The story about a boy suffered burns from the atomic bomb Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum This facility continues to convey the horrors of the atomic bombing. One photo is on display here. A boy with severe burns on his face and arms is being treated by a doctor. &quot;It is filmed in Hiroshima in the very early days after the bombing.&quot; "That's very valuable." "People who burns from a-bomb are looking too miserable." There are not many photographs left of the immediate aftermath of the bombing. Anyone who sees this photo will understand what happened in a split second of the bombing. So this picture is important. Summer of 2023, 78 years after WWII We finally found out who the boy in the photo is. It all started with a single phone call to the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum. &quot;He told me there was a picture of his father in our museum.&quot; "I asked him which picture he was referring to.&quot; The picture he was referring to was the one of the boy being treated for his burns. All we know is that it was taken at the Hiroshima Red Cross Hospital four days after the bombing. &quot;I wish the person who took the picture had asked for the name, or I had a record of where he was from.&quot; "The only thing I have on record about the boy is that he is being treated at the Japanese Red Cross Hospital." "I didn't think there was any way to be sure." Osaka,Japan We visited the man who made the call. "Hello"" "Please come in"" Shogo Harada(50 years old) He was told about 30 years ago that the boy in that picture was his father. He went with his parents to the Peace Memorial Museum in Hiroshima. &quot;Until we went to the museum, we didn't even know that my father had been exposed to the atomic bomb" &quot;My father pointed to a photo at the museum.&quot; &quot;He said &quot;It's me&quot; &quot; &quot;I was so surprised&quot; &quot;I knew the picture, but I never thought it was my father.&quot; His father : Nario Harada Nario had a tragic experience in Hiroshima when he was a boy. Nario was 16 years old at the time of the bombing. He had volunteered to join the army from Kagoshima. He came to Hiroshima as a soldier. His unit was a suicide squad. The mission of his unit was to load the ship with bombs and body slam it into the enemy ship. He was a troop operator. He was exposed to the bomb during a morning assembly at the school where he was camped. It was 1.7 km from the hypocenter, a heavily damaged area He was rushed to Hiroshima Red Cross Hospital. &quot;The hospital was a mess.&quot; &quot;There was little medicine or bandages.&quot; &quot;Nurses at the time recalled that...&quot; &quot;They never felt sad or hard or didn't like the smell at all.&quot; &quot;They told us that they continued to treat the patient with no emotion.&quot; Remaining documents revealed Nario's injuries at the time of the bombing. He had burns all over his body from the bomb. His burns were all over his face, limbs, and other parts of his body. The burns on my face and head were especially bad. He had difficulty opening his mouth and eating. There were times when he would go into a coma. &quot;Nario must have been in so much pain.&quot; &quot;His burns are too severe.&quot; &quot;Burns are very painful, even if only a little.&quot; &quot;How painful would a burn across the face be?&quot; &quot;How painful it must have been for Nario.&quot; &quot;I would guess that there was no pain medication.&quot; Nario was hospitalized for months. He finally got his life back. After the war Nario married his wife Minako. &quot;I was a student when I first met him.&quot; &quot;He was an office worker and he approached me.&quot; &quot;Nario was always fashionable.&quot; &quot;He always wore a cool jacket.&quot; &quot;On holidays, we went to department stores together.&quot; &quot;My father used to cook for me.&quot; &quot;His specialty was okonomiyaki.&quot; Nario died of cancer in 1999 at age 70. Mr. Harada told the Hiroshima museum about his father many years after his father's death. A news prompted Mr. Harada to contact Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum. The news was that the doctor in the photo had been identified. He was Koichi Nagata, an obstetrician and gynecologist. He was dead, but his daughter worried about what happened to the boy afterwards. She said, &quot;My father was able to live out his natural life, but... what happened to that boy after that? That's what I'm worried about.&quot; &quot;No one knew the boy's name.&quot; &quot;I wanted to tell my father's story for posterity.&quot; &quot;That's why I called the Hiroshima museum.&quot; But there was no evidence that the boy was really his father. Tokyo Dental College We commissioned a person-specific expert to investigate. &quot;Hello&quot; Masatsugu Hashimoto Professor Emeritus He has identified many victims of incidents and accidents. He compared and appraised the boy's photo at the museum with that of Nario. He noted the ears in the photos. Left : from the museum /Right : Nario as a boy He superimposed images of the ears and compared the shapes by varying the transparency. &quot;The two ears have matching contours and detail features.&quot; &quot;Ear shape is different for each person, just like a fingerprint.&quot; &quot;In conclusion, it is reasonable to assume that...&quot; &quot; the boy being treated for burns and Nario are the same person.&quot; &quot;It means I have concluded they are the same person.&quot; He authenticated a number of photographs of Nario. All of which matched the boy's description. The boy, unidentified for 78 years, has now finally been identified. We shared our findings with Nario's family. &quot;I am relieved. Glad to hear that.&quot; &quot;My heart is full. I am speechless.&quot; &quot;He was kind to me, and I miss him.&quot; &quot;If my father had died in the bombing... "I wouldn't be here either.&quot; &quot;And my children would not have been born.&quot; &quot;I am glad I am his son.&quot; Hiroshima Okonomiyaki &quot;Delicious. It's so delicious.&quot; (Is it different from Osaka okonomiyaki ?) (How about you?) Mr. Harada and his mother came to Hiroshima for the first time in several years. &quot;I haven't been here in three or four years.&quot; &quot;Haven't we?&quot; &quot;It's hot.&quot; They visit where Nario was. &quot;Nario could have come to this port.&quot; &quot;Those must be the mackerels.&quot; (Have you ever fished with your father?) &quot;My dad used to take me fishing.&quot; &quot;We used to go to the sea fishing park in Suma (Kobe)&quot; &quot;On the train ride home, the box with the fish in it broke.&quot; &quot;The train was full of mackerel.&quot; &quot;We had a hard time, but it was funny.&quot; (Did your father pick up fish?) &quot;My dad and I picked them up together.&quot; &quot;People were leaving that vehicle.&quot; &quot;Because of the fish smell.&quot; &quot;It's a memory of my father.&quot; The wall of the Red Cross Hospital at that time Mr. Harada also suffered from malignant lymphoma in his 30s. The father's exposure to the bomb may have influenced the onset of the disease. Thanks to a bone marrow transplant, he managed to survive. At last they go to my father's picture. He faces his father's A-bomb experience. &quot;This is it.&quot; &quot;I wonder how much pain he must have been in.&quot; &quot;I had heard he had burn marks.&quot; &quot;It's amazing he survived with such severe burns.&quot; &quot;It must have been the doctors' hard work that did it.&quot; Mr. Harada had plans to meet a woman here. &quot;Hello&quot; &quot;Thank you for coming today.&quot; &quot;I'm Nagata&quot; Her name is Yoko Nagata. She is the daughter of the doctor pictured. She is the daughter of the doctor pictured and... She was worried the boy had survived. &quot;Thanks to your father's treatment, "my father survived.&quot;" &quot;I believe it was because the boy had a strong life force.&quot; &quot;This was a really bad injury.&quot; &quot;Thank you for your kind words.&quot; &quot;I was happy to hear he was alive.&quot; &quot;I didn't realize he had survived and started a family.&quot; &quot;Does he have grandchildren?&quot; &quot;He said the doctors and nurses kept him alive.&quot; The doctor and the boy met under difficult circumstances. After 78 years, the two families met again in Hiroshima. "I was so moved." &quot;I never expected something like this to happen&quot; &quot;Not only for Mr. Nario, but for his family....&quot; &quot;I think there was a lot of suffering other than the person himself.&quot; &quot;Many people were suddenly robbed of their daily lives by the atomic bomb.&quot; &quot;When I think of those tens of thousands of people...&quot; &quot;We must value this peace even more.&quot; &quot;The photo of Nario and the doctor continues today to convey the preciousness of peace.&quot;
