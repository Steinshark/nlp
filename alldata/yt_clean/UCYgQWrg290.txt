Last year I surprised my friends at The UK Special Forces. And they absolutely destroyed my friends. But after that video came out, a buddy of PRESTON: What's going on? Sent me a text. 'The US Marines would destroy the SAS.' Oh, really? Well let's test that. I hired some US Marines and a squadron of the SAS, all whilst under the command of myself, and Preston. So that we could determine once and for all PRESTON: America! But what Preston didn't know, was all of the challenges involved [SCREAMING] [DRAMATIC CRESCENDO] Preston was over in London for a couple of days We drank some pints... Watched men kick a ball around, and then I had one more surprise in store for him: PRESTON: Like... Like chant USA? MAX: [LAUGHS] Yeah! That is one way to make sure that everybody I've heard people really like that here. You guys drink warm beer? Yeah. Just as warm as it gets. MAX VOICEOVER: But the further the more suspicious Preston became. This doesn't really feel like where a pub would be. It feels like we're driving into the forest. MAX V/O: And that's because, we were. Go- Go paintball. PRESTON: [LAUGHS] No dude! MAX V/O: No, Preston, we weren't going to the pub at all. So we will be paintballing, but, there is a twist. OK. PRESTON: Are we going to be on a team? MAX: We are playing with some friends of mine. If you've seen the last video I think you can work out No! Preston... [LAUGHTER] MAX: These gentlemen are the SAS, PRESTON: I'm kind of scared. MAX V/O: But there was one more So, you texted me, six months ago 'The US Marines, could of course beat the SAS'. So today, I will be fighting with the SAS. OK. And you'll be fighting with the US Marines. From a similarly secret source, just with a different accent, So after a brief hello, Preston signed a waiver to say it's not PRESTON: Is this me signing my life away? INSTRUCTOR: Yeah, something like that. You've always got to read And then it was time to prepare, for battle. MAX: I think you'd look great in this. I have a feeling this is going to be covered, MAX V/O: And as the two newly appointed generals prepare to lead their squadrons into battle, let's meet the teams. First up, Max Fosh, and Preston Summerrow. Neither know how to fight and are Preston would be leading the US Marines, the only thing more American than And I would be in charge of a group of men with PRESTON: I've never done this before. MAX: Well done, chaps. MAX V/O: Each team would be facing with either Preston or I For the first game of the day: the gauntlet. Preston and I would take it in collect our country's flag, All the while, the opposing team soldiers have The winner? Whoever gets hit There's not much to understand, guys. You see the guy in white and MAX V/O: Things were not looking PRESTON: So it's here, and then MAX: And back. PRESTON: Oh, that's far. MAX V/O: And the first one to be target practice, was me. INSTRUCTOR: Three... INSTRUCTOR: One... Game on! [HEAVY ROCK MUSIC PLAYS] [MAX SCREAMS] [MAX SCREAMS] INSTRUCTOR: Game over! PRESTON: Aaaah! Ow! Ooooow! Great job, Americans. MAX V/O: Next up, Preston versus MAX: Good luck. PRESTON: Thank you. MAX V/O: But little did I know Preston INSTRUCTOR: Three... Two... INSTRUCTOR: Game on! PRESTON: Oh my God! Ow! Aaah! Ah! Oh my God! Ah! [PRESTON LAUGHS] I asked the people at the front desk. It didn't really work, to be honest. MAX V/O: Both of us had been but it looks like the umbrella With self- protection not technically against the rules, and it was time for Paintball Dom to assess the damage. PAINTBALL DOM: The Army did a great job, but Max was quick. With Preston, you really impressed me, So, the winners, are the US Army. PRESTON: Yeah! MAX V/O: Thanks in part to Preston's it was one-nil to Uncle Sam's boys. But could the SAS even the score in game number two? Next up: Bodyguard. Preston and I, with no weapons, will need to be protected, We must make our way from the starting point, at the other side of the map. Once again, the winner is whoever completes the challenge, while getting hit the least. First up this time: Preston. PRESTON: Hands in, USA on three. MAX V/O: With one of the most 1, 2, 3, USA! PRESTON: OK. [LAUGHS] MAX V/O: It was go time. I'm not sure about Preston in this round. INSTRUCTOR: US Army! [INAUDIBLE] Three... two... one... Game on! MAX V/O: The US were off to a blazing start, [VIDEO GAME DING] Looks like Preston's found the special item. [SLURP] PRESTON: I've never been more hydrated. Paintball's thirsty work, so this video is sponsored, by Air Up. Air Up is just water but it works through Hm! 'Wild Berry', as if I've picked those Ow, that's a nettle. PRESTON: Oh! It's recommended that big boy adults like myself and my Air Up bottle helps me get With such flavours as Raspberry, [PRESTON LAUGHS] But for me, I'll stick to my Wild Berry. PRESTON: Thanks very much. Guys, if you want some, use the promo code PRESTON: Should I make a run for it? Air Ups help me cut down on my fizzy drink intake So thanks Air Up, and thanks for sponsoring the video. [PRESTON BREATHES HEAVILY] Alright, I think it's my turn. Am I in pain? Yeah. Great job, guys, really destroyed me. [LAUGHS] I got hit the neck, and the head, MAX: That was good, OK. MAX V/O: Now it was the Brits' turn, and thankfully for this round it sounded like Well, what should we do? MAX: OK. I'll be sticking with one of my soldiers, INSTRUCTORS: 3... 2... 1... Go, go, go! The plan was paying off. SAS SOLDIER: 3, 2, 1, let's go. We managed to secure the secret item, without a lick of paint on me. SAS SOLDIER: There you go, good job. 3, 2, 1, move. But then, disaster. MAX: Ah, shit. With my sole protector out of the game, I had to risk the hits and make a run for it. For England! [MAX SCREAMS] [MAX BREATHES HEAVILY] Got hit in the head. Ow. PRESTON: Wow! Did it break on your- on your face? But what were the official results of game number two? PAINTBALL DOM: Based on the levels of paint, MAX: Yeah! One all! One a piece. With two games complete and the scores even, against an immovable object. That was so sweaty, and we drew. PRESTON: A proper tie. With no final way to decide it. I feel like... it should be mano a mano. Standoff? I think there's only really one way in which we can settle this. With the score tied at one game each, No soldiers, no bodyguards, Good luck, Max. Good luck. INSTRUCTOR: Five... Four... Three... Two... One... Fire! [SHOT] [SHOT] [IMPACT SOUND] [SAD VIOLIN MUSIC PLAYS] PRESTON: Ah! Ah! Ah... Preston? You OK? Preston? PRESTON: Hey man. Good shot. And there you have it, the US and UK Special Forces but when it comes to floppy-haired YouTubers, 10 days later back in LA, and before he does, He's making the best vids on YouTube right now,
