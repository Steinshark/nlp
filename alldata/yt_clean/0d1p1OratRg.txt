This ancient alkali lake bed 7 offers Alan an unobstructed expanse to test his equipment - Get this guy strung up. Start putting tension in here. - [Narrator] Alan is an and in his free time, he puts those skills towards each piece of his custom bow. - It takes a while. Can you can hear that pitch change? (ratchet cranks) - [Narrator] So the first with testing his homemade equipment. - The angle I have it set at, 40 degrees. The brace height is 4 and 7/8 inches. - [Narrator] The goal of the day is to fire his bow by hand and foot. - [Alan] There. - [Narrator] But to dial in his equipment, he starts with a tripod. - Fire in the hole. - [Narrator] And a ratcheting crank.

For decades, Alan has what Harry Drake did in 1971. - There's only three people of all time that ever shot an arrow past a mile. And I'm one of them. But I'm number two. And then there's Harry Drake. (hammer thuds) This is exactly the record So Harry Drake's right and I put one right about And yeah, like I say, I could almost hear him Like, &quot;Stop.&quot; (chuckles) Is it breaking his record, or is it just trying to There's a lot of mysteries - [Narrator] When he is not testing his bows and arrows in the Alvord, you can find Alan in his garage back in Portland making them. - [Alan] You just need so it's like I take my time.
