Now, I'm in Beaune. It's the center of gastronomy! Really? Yes! How about Paris, Lyon, Bordeaux? One of the centers of gastronomy. You're going to piss off Parisian and Bordelais. Shh! Le Monge... I'm glad we made a reservation... it's a must, I think? Everyone's waiting to sit outside. Aha! Hello, we made a reservation for two? Have a seat at the small table there. In the middle? Yeah, we'll serve you once you're seated. Okay, thank you. This is adorable. Badoit, Evian... It's like Korean restarants getting sponsored by soju companies. They give out soju glasses with logos on it, you know? Evian and Badoit must have done the same thing here. Yeah, you're right. Ah, I'm starving. Sorry! *confused laughter* Escargot... Escargot? Hello. Why aren't they taking our orders? They'll come. We've been waiting here for 25 minutes now. I'll raise my hand. Is 'Medaillon de foie gras' a grilled foie gras? Foie gras? Yeah, Medaillon de foie gras. It's just sliced fois gra. I mean, is it grilled or not? No. It's just... it's not grilled. Okay, I'll have Oeuf en meurette, then. And for main course... How about this 'Souris d'agneau confite'? Souris d'agneau(Lamb's smile)? It's lamb, what else could it be? So is it a lamb steak or.... No, it's just... (lady sitting next to us) It's very good. Very good? Okay, thank you! I'll have Souris d'agneau confite... And I'll have le menu bourguignon, please. And I'll have a glass of champagne as an aperitif. I'll have a blackcurrant Kir. For white wine... A bottle of Pernand-Vergelesses 1er cru. And for red... A bottle of Gevery-Chambertin 1er cru, please. Pernand and Gevery, okay. Yeah, that's it. He drinks a lot. I just love to drink! Guests are more polite than staffs here! Where are you from? The Netherlands. Ah, Netherlands. I'm from South Korea. Ah! Yeah, it's a little bit far. They've also been waiting a lot, haven't they? What did you order? Hamburger. Enjoy your aperitif, And we'll bring you the food when you give a command. Okay, I'll do that. Like this! Yes, perfect! They're saying, after we're done with this, Just let them know when we want the appetizers? Pardon? You don't look South Korean. No? Very tall. *laughs* Because I ate a lot of French Cheese! Another plate of cheese, please. Stop, are you mad? And wine. I grow up like this. I drank a lot of wine. Cheers! I like this kind of thing. Even if the waiters are rude, You can just talk it out with the guests. And the atmosphere affects the waiters as well. But not everyone can talk to strangers like this. No. Even if you speak the language, if you're introverted, It doesn't matter how well you speak English or French. It's hard to make a conversation! You're right. I was the same too! Before we got married, I couldn't speak a word. You're good now, honey. I changed a lot, you know? She's rude to both locals and tourists. Doesn't matter you're from Europe, Asia... Even if you're a local, she's rude all the same. You know what's funny? But the French people next to us are still... They've been waiting for desserts. After all this time! They're now just taking their orders! Imagine if we didn't speak their language. We might have thought we were ignored due to our race. It could have come off as racism. They won't explain the menu, even when you ask in French. Yeah. Neither in English. The guests explained the menu for us! It's not a pleasant experience, the opposite actually. Yeah. It's easy to think they're neglecting me because I don't speak French well. They should have at least what kind of meat it was. There are all sorts of restaurants, I guess. She's one of the worst waitress I've seen. I didn't know it could get this bad. There are all sorts of people. But talking it out with the people next to us makes this experience kind of enjoyable. He's starting to get pissed. 'Why are they not taking orders?', he says. Do you want the appetizers now? Sure. Raise your hands, your hands! *waves* We'll have our entree(appetizer) and white wine now! *laughs* What a great guest we have today! I love it! Thanks! I'm so embarassed... I'm blushing, aren't I? I just did as I promised. Even our rude waitress is laughing now. It's the first I've seen her laugh. We don't have Pernand white wine. No? No. Do you have Chassagne-Montrachet 2017? From Girardin winery. I'll go and check, and then let you know. Okay, sure. I'll leave the wine list just in case. Chassagne Vieilles Vignes, right? I'll go check. (She's polite...?) We're waving at everyone before they take a sit. Hello~ Since you insisted on splurging on good wine today... Yeah, I'll let you make that excuse this time. I upgraded our white wine. Cheers! The acacia is strong on the nose. Ah... I can tell it's really minerally from the smell. Here, cheers! Woah, it really sticks to the palate! Tasty! They've got lots of complaints to this restaurant, it seems. (We didn't order red wine) They didn't order red wine... So you want us to take this back? Yes. Did you order white wine? Yes. Ah, okay. Thank you. Here you go. (why does she fold the napkin?) Perfect. A seatbelt for the wine bottle! Thank you. We're getting the best treatment here, I think? She seems to be in a better mood when she's serving us. It's funny, really. It's like guests are serving the staffs here. Though, these kinds of establishments are fairly common in France. Yeah, you see these from time to time. It's got all to do with communicating. In France, I think they don't judge people based on their race or how much money they spend. It's got more to do with your willingness to participate. That's how they judge and treat people here, I think. Yeah, even at a restaurant, ordering food, You have to keep communicating what you want. That's how you get a good service here. Yeah, but for people who aren't aware of this culture, It can be really hard to adjust to. Especially for Asians. Yes. Because we don't share the same culture. Yeah, we expect good hospitality Because we're paying for their service. It's a bit weird for us that our effort is an important factor in this. That will be for me. Uh-oh! (dish slipped) Sorry. My wife ordered six extra escargot. So it should be twelve, not six. Yeah, could you go check with the kitchen? Thanks. (Nothing ever seems to come out right the first time) *knowing laughter* Feels like a movie. Yeah, that's true. Cheers! Feels like it's organized, right? Cheers. Okay! Thank you! Finally! So we have twelve snails~ And mine is Oeuf en meurette! A gift for you. A gift? Ooh-la-la~ Thank you! (What's gotten to them?) Okay, this is... You're eating a whole family of snails! Yeah, a big family! So there's a gift, sudden gift! We've been complaining nonstop! And we get six escargots for free? Have a good evening, good bye! This goes good with wine. She just gave this away. Just because we were nice to her. Ah. They could have just sent this back to kitchen. They're using good ingredients, I think. Yeah. It's light, neat, and delicious. This is much better to escargot we had a few days ago. It was the sauce that was good. Yeah, not the escargot itself. That was frozen, but this is fresh. Yeah, yeah. And the butter is tastier as well. When we get older, we might travel like the couple next to us... Sure, yeah. They did order a main dish, right? Yeah. That's not it, right? Yeah, she's been saying her food hasn't come out after all this time... *sigh* That's rough. The table behind us is same as well. There! There's our waitress! There, there, there! I'm watching. Okay, we will try to call her! (You CAN'T miss!) Okay, okay! *laughs* You're such a charmer. At least she's having fun. Yeah. Thanks to us! We finished this, too. I'll be right back after I put these away. I have a sign that works everywhere! *laughs* Wow, you're not eating all the food at a restaurant, But entertaining all the people as well! Thanks to years of experience. Let's get this bottle out of the way. And put the water in the ice instead. Okay. He doesn't seem angry anymore. Yeah! He's having fun! Let's be frank, it would have been exhausting if we were quietly waiting around. Yeah, that's frustrating. We've been waiting for about 30 minutes now. Yeah, frustrating. But no one came to ask, &quot;Shall we serve the main?&quot; Everyone in this aisle is the same. And the aisle behind us, too! The lady next to us is starving right now. Ah... she didn't have any appetizers. It's ridiculous! She had nothing since she sat down! For an hour and a half... Yeah. At least they're serving our wines. All right. Here's the empty bottle. Thank you. Let's get this out of the way. I'll place this here. Put these two glasses away. Here you go! We didn't have 2014, so I brought 2013. Okay, that's fine. Would you like to taste? Yeah. Thank you. He must be an expert in wine. You're the center of attention here, honey. Yeah, it's good. I'm just a good drinker. Thank you, Salt? And pepper... Yeah, they need salt and pepper. The waitress is nice to us now, but... Yeah, there's nothing we can do. How do you like the wine? It's so good. How's it so smooth? The best time to drink this! The best, yeha? Does it age more than this? It does, and it gets better. (Surprised) Better than this? So this is Domaine Faiveley, Gevrey-Chambertin 1er cru Clos des Issarts Monopole, 2013 My wife loves this! She just told me, &quot;Why haven't I tasted this kind of wine before?&quot; Seriously, it's my first time to drink this kind of good wine! That's not true. Aww... She must have been really hungry. He's really a gentleman. As she's having her hamburger, He noticed there wasn't any salt or pepper, So he got up and got it for her. Since asking the waitress isn't an option... It'll take at least 30 minutes. What if we run out of wine? How much is this? About $200 It's expensive, huh. It is. The white wine was about $120 Burgundy is an expensive place. Yeah The white wine I wanted to order was about $70, But they didn't have any, so I upgraded to $120 wine. Well, so we might as well finish with this. We don't have to. But I'm already tipsy. Not saying we order a better wine than this. No. But we can order something good enough. Something that can just keep us buzzed. How much would this cost in Korean restaurants? In restaurants, about $650. Might as well just spend some money here. I was going for 2014 vintage. But they only had 2013. This is not a bad vintage, though. Second best? Yeah. Old vintage wines are common here. Restaurants in Beaune keep a stock of them. But today's Sunday. Yeah, they close a lot on Sundays. At this place, this is the best. We didn't have many options. Yep. In terms of price-quality, this wine was the best one today. We're in Beaune. This is what we came for. So good. Cheers! Be careful, this is seriously, extremely hot. Okay, thank you. Ooh-la-la~ Thank you! This looks serious. It's Boeuf bourguignon. Which looks really great. Everyone around us is staring, honey. I'm so embarassed! And this one is Souris d'agneau. They got their lamb! Did you notice how everyone hold their breath when it came out? Yeah... Why are they staring? I'm so embarassed. But this lamb looks great. The lamb? Oh, this is good. But it may be too much for you. It's too gamey for your taste. Let's find out how Beaune's Boeuf bourguignon is different. I've never had Boeuf bourguignon in Burgundy. Mmmmm~ So good! Good food. Yeah. Wow, it goes freakishly good with wine. Why is no one ordering this? It's so good! Maybe because it's so common here. No, no. It's amazing with this wine. I guess you won, honey. Mmmm~~~~ Pour! The lady's laughing at me! Mmmm~~~~~ *laughs* Sorry, this is so... Good food, yeah? Yeah, for sure. Ah, it's so good. (local next to us)You speak French really well. Oh, thanks. You too! *laughs*(They are French) Where are you from? South Korea. You came a long way. Just a bit, yeah. What brings you here? We're visiting Germany and France to travel. How's your trip so far? Good! Great, I love it! Meaning she loves me, which is great. *laughs* Thank you. You're welcome. This sauce's got a lot of wine in it. That's where the sourness comes from. That good? One more bottle, please. Okay. We just can order carafe wine. No, going to carafe now is... There shouldn't be too much of a gap. Ah... because you get disappointed. You can taste the difference even when you're drunk. The wine list, please? My wife says she's thirsty! I'm alright, though. She's going to bed early today. Yep! A bit early. Maybe here, at this table? *laughs* Thank you. Great. (Wait...) No, no! No, no!!! Another bottle of wine. For the peace of my family. (Thumbs up) See anything nice? Do you want fruity and rich? Or do you want powerful and delicate? Powerful and delicate. The latter? Okay. You're amazing, you know. Why? The staffs were rude. And every client was upset because of her. Yeah. But you managed to make her laugh, And entertain the guests here as well. That's the power of good wine. A bottle of Aloxe-Corton 2017 Domaine Pierre-Ravaux, please. Thank you. *laughs* It's not me who's drinking! No... No, no, no, no. I'm very dry. That's the reason my glass is almost empty and... Her glass is full! You want cheese after this? Or... Cheese? Cheese would be nice. Cheese good? Mm-hmm. Even the people who weren't drinking are ordering wines too... Because when you see people next to you... Yeah, makes you thirsty too. It stimulates your appetite. Yeah. (To the lady next to us)Excuse me, what's that? Jet 27. It's a mint liquor called Jet 27. ABV 27%. About twice as much of wine's. You mix Perrier with it. It's digestif. You should try this! Okay. No... Yes! No...... Yes!! Thanks for the answer. So you're finished? He's laughing. *laughs* My gosh... (Empty dishes) (Empty bottles) Thank you. (And glasses, too) Everything just... *laughs* I love him! (Doing the dishes) Let's finish this and... Desserts? Mm-hmm. I want to try that mint liquor, too. But I forgot what it was. Just ask again. You're not going to remember when this moment is over. I'm so full of appetite today! (Is there anything left) Sorry, what was the name? Jet 27. Jet as in plane, and the number 27. Jet 27 mixed with Perrier. Okay. Thanks a lot. Got it? Jet 27! There you go. Jet 27! Mm-hmm. You're ordering something? Yeah... Jet 27 mixed with Perrier, please. For me, for me. Just a moment, I'll be right back. I'm not really in the position to take order right now... (She's holding tablecloths) (table next to us) You're going to make your bed or something? *laughs* You've got a great sense of humor. Why? She was holding a lot of tablecloths. So she made a joke. 'Do I really have to take your orders like this?' But then... What the man next to us said meant, 'You don't even do your work right.' 'So you're going to sleep now?' At the end of the day, the guest is king.
