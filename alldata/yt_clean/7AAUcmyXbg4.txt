&gt;&gt; BILL MOYERS: Hello, and welcome to this special We want to tell you the story whose lives embody what's of millions of Americans It's a story that begins when we first met the Stanleys families my mother, would have called &gt;&gt; I want my kids to... &gt;&gt; Grow up to be good kids. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I want good children. &gt;&gt; I can tell you've been You're saying, &quot;Yes, ma'am.&quot; MOYERS: Hard workers, caring parents, faithful church-goers trying to secure a foothold But as we came back to visit we watched their children grow &gt;&gt; Now I'm putting longer hours but it's not that much, &gt;&gt; MOYERS: We saw by the powerful economic that were altering &gt;&gt; Here's my paycheck. $9,646.89. That's poverty. &gt;&gt; MOYERS: And as America in Milwaukee, working people found themselves barely staying even at best. So now, 22 years in the making, the intimate and revealing story (choir singing) &gt;&gt; Tony and I since we were probably His mother and my mother at Pulaski High School, and our grandparents, you know, they played cards, so I don't know, we just started spending a lot of time and he just asked me out, We were crazy about each other. We had to spend a lot of time and I could just picture myself spending the rest And our expectations were, you find the man that and have a family, and get a house, you know, all those little Um, some of it came true, but some of it I didn't expect either. You know, I knew they weren't but you don't think of all the &gt;&gt; MOYERS: Terry Neumann dreamed of a good, &gt;&gt; When we got married, we had He was working factory And he made pretty good money you know, for a young couple &gt;&gt; Grab a couple &gt;&gt; I don't know, we had so we had another one, You know, and then I got and he had lost his job. Then he got hired at Briggs &quot;Okay, this is a very stable and we bought the house. &gt;&gt; MOYERS: Buying a home was But Tony had a good job with the engine maker then the largest employer &gt;&gt; Years ago, you got a Briggs and Stratton. &gt;&gt; MOYERS: Briggs and dozens of other had helped make Milwaukee just about the American dream's celebrated in sitcoms... &gt;&gt; Give us any chance, &gt;&gt; MOYERS: And sentimentalized &gt;&gt; So when Miller time we raise a glass to you, You've earned it. &gt;&gt; MOYERS: When we met American manufacturers chasing cheap labor Of over 40,000 good-paying jobs lost from Milwaukee about 4,000 One of them was Tony Neumann's. &gt;&gt; It sort of goes like this. Here and here. &gt;&gt; He gets into Briggs &quot;Oh, this is a good company, Now we have the house, &gt;&gt; We gotta drill a hole. How big a hole do you want? &gt;&gt; Not that big. &gt;&gt; But it's either rent for and we prefer to own. I mean... &gt;&gt; MOYERS: That's supposed to be &gt;&gt; That's supposed to be Where is it? &gt;&gt; MOYERS: Tony had been making Now the jobs available commonly paid &gt;&gt; I've applied over at grocery &gt;&gt; McDonald's. &gt;&gt; Hardee's, Super America, Most of them will not pay They're all less than Little do they know &gt;&gt; Thank you, have a nice day. &gt;&gt; Then one of these. And then you need a business &gt;&gt; MOYERS: While her husband Terry tried to bring in She bought skin care products and then tried reselling them &gt;&gt; Look in the mirror and say, well, you know, &gt;&gt; It's softer, yeah. &gt;&gt; The complexion, the color... And that's basically why &gt;&gt; MOYERS: But she lost money and their troubles &gt;&gt; Are you gonna call him back? &gt;&gt; Am I gonna call him back? Yeah, I'm gonna have &gt;&gt; Well, you talked &gt;&gt; MOYERS: How much is &gt;&gt; I believe it's $820. &gt;&gt; $819? &gt;&gt; Yeah, $820 &gt;&gt; MOYERS: And have you been &gt;&gt; No, and we're behind. And today, the mortgage company &gt;&gt; MOYERS: Again? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; MOYERS: What did they say? because I wanted to talk So I wanted to talk to him. &gt;&gt; MOYERS: You must dread it &gt;&gt; I do. I cringe. &gt;&gt; MOYERS: Long before the term was on America's lips, laid-off working people &gt;&gt; I did send probably a few weeks back, but the check was sent back &quot;We will not accept I don't really think of that I think of that and a good gesture on trying Right now we're going through My husband's out of work. He went to school And I'm basically just trying so we can get on our feet again, so we can get caught up. I would think that this is just not a permanent thing, and I really don't want Are you just trying to tell me that you have to foreclose if I don't have that You would recommend it. &gt;&gt; Is he putting this on paper? I want to know. Is he putting this on paper? Dear? &gt;&gt; It really bothers us that we I just wanna get up just go in the car and have a normal life again. &gt;&gt; You get the peanut butter &gt;&gt; I don't like having to go &quot;I have no food in the house, Where when you would go and work and come home &gt;&gt; You'd be giving this food &gt;&gt; Well, now the shoe's Makes me feel very I'd rather be on the giving side &gt;&gt; They have peanut butter, I understand that if you put it and maybe add a little onion &gt;&gt; Oh, what happened to his ear? He wants to go back He doesn't like all you kids. &gt;&gt; He don't have no house. &gt;&gt; Can you reach that high, &gt;&gt; I wanna hold him &gt;&gt; Okay, you can hold him &gt;&gt; They've made comments too, like, &quot;Mom, They've got little baseball and that hurts, because they're willing to help their parents out. &gt;&gt; I've been getting I've been losing my temper I've tried doing things. I work in the garage when I get angry, I'm having a hard time (TV voices) &gt;&gt; What are you doing today? &gt;&gt; MOYERS: How do you deal the anger and the... &gt;&gt; I can't. It's very difficult. &gt;&gt; Yeah, our marriage This is really difficult time... this is a real difficult time. I've been thinking about divorce &gt;&gt; MOYERS: Why? &gt;&gt; I can't deal I'm just having a real hard time &gt;&gt; MOYERS: You feel guilty? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I do. I feel I should be &gt;&gt; MOYERS: You think he really or is this just an escape? &gt;&gt; I think it's an escape and I just think he figures But really the problems are because he's still going to have and I feel it's going I just feel it's just and if we can just get then we'll be back (choir singing) (choir finishes hymn) &gt;&gt; Good morning, everybody. &gt;&gt; Good morning, Father. &gt;&gt; We gather on this Sunday to praise our triune God, in the name of the Father &gt;&gt; MOYERS: As Tony and Terry across town, in Milwaukee's a second hard-working family Like Tony Neumann, Claude He lost his assembly line job A.O. Smith. &gt;&gt; When I got laid off but I could not stand I just said, &quot;It's not me. This is not me.&quot; They want to give me food I don't want no food stamps.&quot; I say, &quot;I got my strength, I'm gonna find me a job,&quot; &gt;&gt; MOYERS: He found a job for less than seven dollars not even half of what &gt;&gt; You got to look at it I cannot live like I was making Okay, that money is not there. So you might as well get it it's not there no more. So okay, bring yourself down. &gt;&gt; MOYERS: Claude and his wife their daughter Nicole, about to the oldest son, Keith, the twins and the youngest, Omega. &gt;&gt; I think the hardest time is when you have to worry like I say, and then there's a bill saying the water's cut off, The guy just called saying or the electricity's off. And you have to wait until Mom and Dad can get enough &gt;&gt; MOYERS: Their neighborhood, was mostly African American and had once thrived that paid enough Now those jobs and people here were trying People like Jackie Stanley, &gt;&gt; Do you have any houses that we could show? &gt;&gt; While I was on the motor line I began to study my real estate. I went ten times The tenth time, I passed. And I promised that as soon as I was going to go on And that's exactly what I did. &gt;&gt; Hi, Joe. This is Jacqueline Stanley &gt;&gt; It's just like anything else. It's really unsure. &gt;&gt; Okay, I just got in &gt;&gt; You only get excited when and have the check in your hand. You never get overexuberant. And I'm learning that every day. &gt;&gt; Mom's real estate I've seen her try They seem so good and at the last minute, &gt;&gt; The listing is for September. It's already October... &gt;&gt; And that falling apart that falling apart And to someone else that they decide not but for us, it's a matter but it's a matter of light And that's scary. &gt;&gt; MOYERS: As good jobs the number of African Americans from about 25% in the 1970s The Stanleys vowed But as property values fell so did real estate commissions. And when Jackie tried to sell she met resistance. &gt;&gt; It was on the market &gt;&gt; It's because they didn't have &gt;&gt; (laughs): Okay. &gt;&gt; People of color really have a much more difficult time than white people. It may be a situation where and not get the courtesy Maybe her client that she takes has a much more difficult time, getting the mortgage. &gt;&gt; All right, fax it to me. &gt;&gt; I can't sell suburbs. I can't sell the most And that hurts. But they'll call me &gt;&gt; You talk to your friends, &quot;Well, I'm going to be Well, how about you?&quot; And you're like, &quot;Well, That's all you can say right now They always ask me, &quot;Why don't you go out there like the rest of the kids do?&quot; You say you can't, You have to go out there &gt;&gt; MOYERS: To help out, Claude Jr. and Klaudale, They called it the Three Sons &gt;&gt; How much money when you grow up? &gt;&gt; Probably about Something like that. Three hundred million, &gt;&gt; Do you think you will? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I've seen my mom on the phone asking them when they would when they were about She was pleading She asked the bill collectors and sometimes the gas on, and that makes me want &gt;&gt; MOYERS: The country was deep The president predicted &gt;&gt; We will get this recession and return to growth soon. (applause) We will get on our way and achieve the competitive that will carry us into the next &gt;&gt; MOYERS: But the problem By 1991, Milwaukee's new economy depended on non-union the vast majority of them and fewer benefits. That was still the case when we returned to the city But by the beginning of 1993, that things were &gt;&gt; I, William Jefferson Clinton, and will to the best preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United &gt;&gt; Congratulations. (applause) &gt;&gt; From the way it was more like he would than Mexico, Europe, He wasn't going to send out of the country, And I guess that maybe we might have openings and maybe you might not have to More people will have jobs, and things'll probably &gt;&gt; Ladies and gentlemen, the President William Jefferson Clinton. &gt;&gt; This president, and relate to somehow. &gt;&gt; Four more years, You need to grow up &gt;&gt; Today, we celebrate &gt;&gt; I've been there with Reagan, I'm not saying It's that you say a lot of stuff Even if I was running for &quot;Everybody get free candy So you say a lot of stuff &gt;&gt; We inherit an economy that is but is weakened by business &gt;&gt; I think if they work a lot of people will probably Give people something to wake up A purpose! &gt;&gt; A purpose &gt;&gt; Right. I think that will change &gt;&gt; Changed mine. &gt;&gt; I invited the Neumanns because a year ago, they may not have had as You didn't have a steady job &gt;&gt; That's a fact. &gt;&gt; That's a fact. What is the fact today? &gt;&gt; I have more than enough work. &gt;&gt; More than enough work! &gt;&gt; MOYERS: Tony Neumann making engine parts (organ playing) Amen, amen... &gt;&gt; MOYERS: Like many in the new the job was non-union. It paid $8.25 an hour, It got the Neumanns but it wouldn't balance &gt;&gt; Just with the mortgage we And it will take us two years because they tack on interest and whatever else. So that three months That's a long time. So whatever extra money we have, because we want to make sure we have it paid off &gt;&gt; MOYERS: To make ends meet, &gt;&gt; Guess what? I'm on the honor roll. &gt;&gt; That's great. &gt;&gt; MOYERS: And Terry, realized she would have despite needing to be home She began taking a series of &gt;&gt; Anyone for peas? &gt;&gt; Nope. &gt;&gt; MOYERS: Meanwhile, worked the night shift &gt;&gt; One nation, under God, with liberty and justice &gt;&gt; Tonight is Boy Scouts. They have a pack meeting where all of the dens get &gt;&gt; Adam Neumann has passed &gt;&gt; Congratulations, Adam. &gt;&gt; They have their awards being so this is kind of like &gt;&gt; Daniel Neumann, please come &gt;&gt; That's one thing Tony misses, because he used to be very So he had to give that up. &gt;&gt; Good job, Daniel! &gt;&gt; Can I have this? &gt;&gt; Sure you can. &gt;&gt; Daniel! &gt;&gt; Daniel! &gt;&gt; Daniel, look for your &gt;&gt; Get in here! &gt;&gt; And your backpack! &gt;&gt; And shut the door! &gt;&gt; With me working and Tony and we weren't all together &gt;&gt; Karissa, where is it? &gt;&gt; How can he lose a backpack? &gt;&gt; In the room. &gt;&gt; Daniel started getting and he kept to himself a lot. His attitude just changed You know, he got really distant. &gt;&gt; Daniel, he's still having &gt;&gt; I'm sure that Daniel of your relationship with Tony, and the work issue, Some kids almost blame in a family, you know, and they have to realize that's a tough situation Everybody's doing You love him, and you'll always be there &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; A lot of our children here are getting themselves up coming home to an empty house Ideally, we would have a parent and someone there when they come home at night. But that's, you know, and you know, we do what &gt;&gt; Danny Neumann. &gt;&gt; Period at the end. &gt;&gt; Period at the end. &gt;&gt; MOYERS: Even as working were just hanging on, the new economy the stock market was and for investors, the good &gt;&gt; Thank you, hallelujah. Yes, Lord, Lord, we thank you, how you make ways Lord, we thank you &gt;&gt; MOYERS: Claude Stanley served on Sundays. &gt;&gt; We thank you, Lord, and we thank you &gt;&gt; MOYERS: he was on his By 1993, to foreman which paid him less than &gt;&gt; Factory job, This job, You're only making about seven. Yeah, you might get some bonuses but ain't that great. &gt;&gt; I think he made about &gt;&gt; At Smith, yeah. &gt;&gt; And I made $35,000 &gt;&gt; At Briggs, mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; And that's... so we're out half of that. If we made what we made we would be really well off. House would be paid for, kids at least would have some &gt;&gt; But we look on each other You know, some days she has bad but like, if I'm not producing, You know, when I can't, We try to find a way You got some families probably you know, how do we make it? &gt;&gt; We don't even know. &gt;&gt; How do you make it? &gt;&gt; We just keep holding on. You know, we shop, we shop. I found out that there are that have food half-price We rummage. &gt;&gt; Oh, my goodness, Omega! These are $70 in the store, &gt;&gt; I come here because I work they come in the offices. From the cologne to the shoes, And I can't afford &gt;&gt; For $24, this one I want. This is for work. My accessories that I wear, they're, like, five, I pay 99 cents. &gt;&gt; This is something &gt;&gt; Something I would wear? No, I think Elvis Presley (laughing) No, I wouldn't wear that. &gt;&gt; Nobody wants to be that doesn't have Even if you have to, as one &quot;Fake it 'til you make it.&quot; And that's what we do We wear exactly what the people &gt;&gt; $63.03. &gt;&gt; That's the very same house. Are you planning on keeping &gt;&gt; MOYERS: For Jackie, the home It was the pay &gt;&gt; And with my kind of work I get paid on commission, And it's rough. &gt;&gt; MOYERS: Jackie was just handling this sale, and had &gt;&gt; Don't go in the back hallway, &gt;&gt; MOYERS: After also paying to her employer, she figured to &gt;&gt; If we're going to do then you also have to remember they take the 28% out of the so you're down again. &gt;&gt; MOYERS: She reckoned that if she could keep a larger share &gt;&gt; I've set goals and I plan on going because I've got to come out That's it. &gt;&gt; Are you happy? &gt;&gt; And there's something &quot;So a man thinketh, If I think poverty I can't afford to talk negative and then allow my children down or depressed. &gt;&gt; MOYERS: As she persevered her neighborhood seemed to be &gt;&gt; Even on this street, just about every door here I wanted you to see here. There was &quot;Kill you&quot; written if you don't join the gangs, &gt;&gt; MOYERS: Just blocks Jackie's uncle was murdered &gt;&gt; All I can tell them Every day, and I have to encourage them. Many times Keith has said to me, He did a 3.5. &quot;What does it matter?&quot; And I said &gt;&gt; Watch out! &gt;&gt; The other day we was... the snow was heavy And someone stood at the window &quot;Look at your family, And they called us I know they meant to say And they said, &quot;We see it looks good.&quot; But it<i> looks</i> good. &gt;&gt; MOYERS: Two years later, getting a job wasn't the problem There was even a shortage &gt;&gt; Employers in some parts they can't find enough and Governor Thompson announced to address those shortages. &gt;&gt; MOYERS: The problem, still, was that jobs Like millions of others, the Neumann family a second full-time income and Terry Neumann and proud to be doing so. &gt;&gt; I have a new job. I'm a driver and a guard. And a messenger. My hourly pay right now To start. It has very good which my husband doesn't have. He gets more money and I've got less money so hopefully &gt;&gt; It kind of works out. &gt;&gt; I get a lot of looks A lot of double takes, that, I love it. I think it's great. You know? &gt;&gt; MOYERS: Working? &gt;&gt; Working, yeah. And having the power behind I like it. &gt;&gt; MOYERS: The power &gt;&gt; Yeah, I get a lot more looks than sitting in the kitchen (laughing) &gt;&gt; Good morning! &gt;&gt; MOYERS: I remember your how important it was that you were home with the kids. Daniel was having a few approaching teenage years. You just felt it was best &gt;&gt; Right, I still feel that way, we're put into a situation, &gt;&gt; You got any homework? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I got a lot. I got this little worksheet. I got a couple other things, &gt;&gt; MOYERS: The Neumanns from their combined income But the kids were coming home &gt;&gt; She probably thinks about us how we're doing at home. Gets a little worried and if we made it home. &gt;&gt; MOYERS: You're not the only where both husband and wife Or kids are coming home &gt;&gt; There's a lot of kids There's quite a bit of commotion as far as the kids doing pretty much &gt;&gt; Because they're not &gt;&gt; Yeah, they're never &gt;&gt; The parents aren't here and that's the reason why you have so much teenage &gt;&gt; Yeah, violence. &gt;&gt; That's what I'm worried I want my kids to... &gt;&gt; Grow up to be good kids. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I want good children. &gt;&gt; MOYERS: So you're betting the kids will come through &gt;&gt; I've tried and to teach them right And I'm just hoping that through all of this. I hope they've learned how hard it is and how everybody needs to make This is how it is in order to get through this &gt;&gt; MOYERS: In the Stanley oldest son Keith becoming the first man to graduate high school. &gt;&gt; Aw, Mommy! (Jackie crying) &gt;&gt; I've been talking for years You're the first one. &gt;&gt; Keith Kenyatta Stanley. (applause and cheers) &gt;&gt; That's my boy! &gt;&gt; MOYERS: He was heading but Keith was determined That meant college. And in the fall, he enrolled &gt;&gt; MOYERS: How do you afford &gt;&gt; I negotiated two transactions and closed them And you're talking &gt;&gt; MOYERS: only paid for part They would have to find &gt;&gt; MOYERS: What does it take &gt;&gt; It's $7,000 a year. Keith? Hi. How you doing? &gt;&gt; MOYERS: Is he gonna be able &gt;&gt; I just received a letter that or Keith will have to be put out We were concerned that came from your school. But again, Keith had applied for a lot We came up with something. Oh, that's so sweet. I can tell you've been You're saying, &quot;Yes, ma'am.&quot; Your Discover card came in. I called the Discover card and I told them we wanted &gt;&gt; MOYERS: expect God to give them What you got was a $1,000 credit &gt;&gt; But it'll tide me over So then this semester You hear me? All right, I love you. It's called, And I'm robbing Peter so much that Peter is just Send it to the bank. &gt;&gt; MOYERS: The Stanleys trying to survive the good times Living on credit Over that decade, for the average American family For low-income families, And the paychecks Claude Stanley was making as he had been As a supervisor, he did have Those he supervised? They weren't so lucky. &gt;&gt; MOYERS: What do these guys do &gt;&gt; There's no benefits. That's the main thing, &gt;&gt; MOYERS: Claude's benefits proved A serious lung infection required an extended stay and kept him out of work When we next saw him, He told us the family faced approaching some $30,000-- $30,000 they didn't have. &gt;&gt; It will be rough, you know. It'll hit us financially, you know, we depend on the Lord but we ain't going We gotta keep moving, &gt;&gt; Welcome to Burger King. Can I take your order, sir? &gt;&gt; Could I have &gt;&gt; MOYERS: meant that paying for college was out of the question. &gt;&gt; Let's see that pose again. &gt;&gt; MOYERS: but the twins had graduated. Claude, Jr. including doing some modeling. His twin Klaudale took (officer shouting) He joined the Navy. &gt;&gt; I, Klaudale Lamar Stanley, do solemnly swear that I will &gt;&gt; MOYERS: He went through &gt;&gt; Six more days &gt;&gt; MOYERS: And would soon be at the Pentagon. &gt;&gt; Navy Washington operator #30, &gt;&gt; MOYERS: Older brother Keith, was now a senior and on his own financially. He had some aid as a resident assistant and the organist at his church. But when we visited in 1999, we found him on the verge of &gt;&gt; So what I do usually is, I just have to go and pay for it and that's the only way And if that's what it takes that's what I'm going to do My current balance for this The interest on this is, I &quot;No fee first year. Apply now.&quot; They're everywhere. &gt;&gt; MOYERS: Keith's parents had decided to become entrepreneurs. Borrowing against their home, they bought a Central City where Jackie could start and Claude could set up shop &gt;&gt; We're talking that's so quick to get rich and quick to go somewhere. &gt;&gt; MOYERS: They would use it Claude had become Their faith remained as strong as their future seemed &gt;&gt; God is good, he's good, &gt;&gt; I got an article from<i> &quot;Every person is going to need at least (laughs) &gt;&gt; MOYERS: Across town, with the toll on family life exacted by their different hours especially since Tony was still &gt;&gt; It takes a little It seems like you only get somewhere between four and you have to be able &gt;&gt; Sometimes I like him but since he's on third shift, he can't really help me because he's normally sleeping he gets really irritable &gt;&gt; I already told you, food is going to be off limits &gt;&gt; The only time is towards the time That's when I have to ask him on if I can do stuff or I need him to sign papers and then I normally go to bed &gt;&gt; Actually, I would prefer to I would really like to sit down and have a nice dinner I would really enjoy that. Terry and I are never really We're not really getting along We don't sleep together anymore. It's really... It stinks. &gt;&gt; MOYERS: The Neumanns began &gt;&gt; I don't like going because I don't want &gt;&gt; It's like he's, &quot;Hello, (laughing) He never laughs, &gt;&gt; Well, he's serious. He wants to get to the root &gt;&gt; And Dad even said that and then you guys scheduled and I told the boys that and they got all happy. Because the boys don't like &gt;&gt; MOYERS: At decade's end, Daniel, now 17, and Adam, 15, but having trouble focusing &gt;&gt; Goodbye! Behave, be in by curfew. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay, I'm going to work now. &gt;&gt; MOYERS: for one that paid more: But her schedule was Sometimes she worked from 4:00 and might have to come back and work the overnight. She was always on call on just two hours' notice. &gt;&gt; By the time I get home, I get tired. &gt;&gt; MOYERS: Terry and Tony than he had made working But despite all the hard work, these two American families one of the most prosperous &gt;&gt; We began the new century the fastest economic growth the lowest unemployment rates We have built a new economy. &gt;&gt; MOYERS: before we came back We found a city with over a quarter of its Some people had done very well. Parts of the city And over the previous decade, &gt;&gt; A future of hope with a growing economy. And that is what we have. Unemployment is low, inflation This economy is on the move. &gt;&gt; MOYERS: But the promises two costly wars, and a housing market &gt;&gt; The Obama administration says to keep struggling homeowners &gt;&gt; MOYERS: American families by the greatest economic since the Great Depression. &gt;&gt; We're raised to believe that each generation can and But is that really true? &gt;&gt; MOYERS: We wanted to know to the two American families We found Jackie Stanley How are you? &gt;&gt; The graduate! &gt;&gt; MOYERS: Along with a grown-up &gt;&gt; I never would have never would have made it &gt;&gt; MOYERS: But Jackie quickly that when we called her to see she almost said no. &gt;&gt; MOYERS: She said that after she had quit doing real estate that her dream of having her own that she hadn't done enough &gt;&gt; Sometimes we gonna go through and God ain't gonna bring it out like you think the way you want it to come out. &gt;&gt; MOYERS: Turns out Claude's hadn't worked out either. &gt;&gt; You might be and you hear about and you might go home &quot;Lord, don't let that happen I want to keep my job.&quot; And guess what? Guess what? You get laid off anyhow Guess what? You got to praise God anyhow. Glory to God, Thank you, Jesus. God is good. &gt;&gt; MOYERS: Now the couple on a job Claude had taken &gt;&gt; MOYERS: How did you find &gt;&gt; I was looking and it said something &gt;&gt; MOYERS: Forestry? &gt;&gt; During the summertime I do work with the boulevards, all the boulevards with the flowers, the grass being cut. &gt;&gt; MOYERS: And the winter? &gt;&gt; Right now I'm in sanitation, &gt;&gt; MOYERS: &gt;&gt; Yes it is, Bill, &gt;&gt; I think one of the biggest is just his work ethic. I remember he helped me install I was tired by the end My dad is on the ground, and showing me how to put And I was like, &quot;Man, this guy, &gt;&gt; MOYERS: &gt;&gt; I'm almost 60 years old. &gt;&gt; MOYERS: How long do you think &gt;&gt; Not too long. (laughing): &gt;&gt; MOYERS: Claude is a member He makes about $26,000 a year, It's one of a series of jobs since we last saw him and inspecting homes. &gt;&gt; And you talking about doing I had to work at the airport &gt;&gt; MOYERS: &gt;&gt; I worked on the runway, directing the planes to come in, take the luggage to the tunnel, It was all kinds of stuff &gt;&gt; MOYERS: &gt;&gt; Definitely was minimum wage.
