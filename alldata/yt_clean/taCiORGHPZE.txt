In order to pull this deal, I had to If you're gonna tell me your life We were all set to pull a job in Abilene. The Clifton people had clean hands. They only passed on the information. They said they were going to alibi for me. Everything was perfect, there were no risks. We were to split the money down the middle. And those clean hands tricked you. You're damn right they did. They testified against me. The money disappeared. Well, what could I do? My word against a banker? A judge? The rest of those... And, so, my 50,000 ended up Exactly.

All those people that are The Perkins ranch is to the north so they should be coming from down there. Scott, remember... A man on horseback has his horse and his gun. So you cannot let them dismount. Now, find yourself a spot where you can't be seen. - You want me to shoot? And when you shoot, shoot fast. And hit your target. Uh-huh. Your boys on the watch, huh? Where have you put your little errand boy? You'd better step aside Give yourself up, Talby. Listen, men. There's been a trial You're putting yourself So clear out of here Since when you protecting killers You'd better listen to me, Mackenzie. Remember what happened to Hart. He met the wrong man and had a bad end. Why listen to this fool'? We didn't come here Come on, let's make this Talby dance! Better get out of here. He's spread Go to the devil, will you? You stay back. What are you waiting for? What's going on here... Good work, Scottie. Now, nobody will dare get in your way. - Not in this town. No problem. It's just on the left side. Four dead and two wounded. I want to know I only shot after Scott... I think this town is ours. Nothing more to be done Absolutely unbelievable. - Unbelievable. You'll have to acquit Where is he? You've taken plenty of time. My friend is wounded. This one's much worse! That's one of the men who attacked us. Scott. You've been drinking. Don't touch me, you bastard. I'll not be sweeping in front of your Now, get out, you bastard, you! What did you do to him? He's acting like some rabid wolf. He was born a wolf. You made him rabid, not me. Good boy, Scott Mary. You've always been underestimated. I'm the first to recognise it Bring me the broom. - What? The same one you gave me Scott... go back to the stable. After you, Marshal. Pigs go before. - I'm gonna show you... Don't go anything foolish. Not now. What you been needing is a beating, Scott. With a big, big stick. A big stick, huh? I used to have one once. Watch this. Hold it, Murray. No! Mm... Scott... This isn't what I wanted for you. Come away. Go to hell. All of you! You're pretty damn fast, Scott Mary. - Not bad. Go ahead. Was he your friend? He the one - Yes, that was him. Murph Allan. That's right. He works in the stable Murph Allan SHORT. NOW I remember. He's gotten so old - You know him? He was a marshal in Abilene once. Ran me out of town with a rifle at my back. It was a long time ago, You know, maybe he was right. I should take your gun away Don't try it, Talby. It's too late. Yeah. It's too late. Oh... You've made yourself Thanks. Been hit, Talby? The old wound hasn't healed yet. Who was he? Is he with us or against us? Why did he save your life? Pretty soon we'll find out. Gentlemen... Owen, what's the idea? Why did you save the life of that man, Owen? We've brought you here to kill him. I've travelled for 500 miles to get here. And I couldn't let a barber Then you must have known it was Talby. - And you went and saved him. Well. Since you're so sure here's a third of it now. - The rest after. It may cost you a little more this way. Drink to my health, Nigel? Now... this was Corbitt's. Now it's yours. It's a great rifle, I gotta warn you: Owen is able to shoot Poor old Corbitt was Nigel... the weapon that's gonna Who knows? I've heard that you're And I don't want to question that... Talby. But who knows if you'd take on a real duel? You mean one of those games Almost. Except on horseback. And with front-loading rifles. You got a reason for this? I've already told you once, Talby... - You've made a lot of enemies. All right. I'll kill you any way you want. Tomorrow morning. At sunrise. No.No, no.No. No, please. Don't do it. It... it... it... it wasn't my idea. Oh... don't. No, no... Don't ruin me. No. It wasn't me. I didn't want to. I'll do whatever you want. You know something, Murray? - I don't like this place anymore. Pretty soon, I'll be You know what I'm gonna call it? The Forty-Five. In honour of this one. Uh-huh. I'm dissolving our partnership. Now I want my half. Your thousand dollars? Now come on, Murray. You know Now, I'm not good at mathematics, But you gave me... $20,000. But I don't - A note for payment on demand. Sign it. That's it. I'll fill in the amount later. Mr Talby... Here's your receipt. Where did you find that pistol? That? Oh, the marshal gave it to me. Huh... Who are you now? Murph Allan Short? Or are you simply plain Murph? One day I made my choice. You can never go back. Tell the truth. You don't like my being with Talby. You watch out. They've been saying You may be faster and quicker but... in order to survive, - Experience. Talby should be about 45. That's a bad age for a gunman. Every day you feel yourself getting slower. Your muscles still react, Talby's done the same He's taken a helper. Somebody young who shoots That's a lie. But even if it was true, what's bad in that? The day will come when you'll This is his last chance. His last city. Either he sets himself up here for life or he leaves his skin. I don't believe anymore Scott... Never hammer a hammer. Just... caress it. And that's just what Talby said. - I don't get it. But, Murph... What's the point? That's one of his tricks. You shoot like this. And he shoots like... this. But if you hold the barrel like that... you'll make sure... Of course, that's why He can fire six shots And he's more accurate. It's all in the gun. Was it he who chose your gun? Yeah, Murph. It's a beautiful weapon. Beautiful, huh? But the barrel is seven inches long. Huh... The best size for me. Have you seen Talby's gun? Yes, it's one like mine. Erm... only it's missing the sight. Exactly. It hasn't got a sight You have two more inches of barrel. Two more inches to draw. You know what that means? Look, I've had more But you think you're putting me a pistol much shorter than mine? Think of me, when the day comes, if you - I'm going. If anything should happen to me, I've hidden a package there, in that box where Bah... Take it... if you remember me. But leave it there, Forget it! Place your bets. Place your bets. Fourteen for the gentleman. - Deuce or house... Where she stops, nobody knows. Get your bets in, please. Looks like you won, sir. Well... you're very lucky. Here you are. Two deputies are outside. They'll get what they're looking for. Two deputies are outside. What do we do? Stand guard at the upstairs window. You can go out the back where I came in. Be careful. These guys aren't just cowboys. You go ahead. What do you want? You are going to get yourself killed Scott. Shut up. I don't believe you. Wait and see. He'll step in just one second to late to be in danger. Look I'm going. I had enough. Listen, nobody is gonna shoot at your back. I just wanted you to know that. I'm not afraid of anyone. Hey, Cross. Looking for someone? What do you say? Want to leave things up to the pistols? You begin, Cross. I'm a deputy. You got that clear? I represent the law. You're just like All right. I'm ready. Scott... everything all right? Put away your spitfire, Talby. It's all over. In this town, there ain't Come on inside. We gotta celebrate. His songs were sad... He won't play anymore. I don't think this is a night to celebrate. When did you get so sentimental, Scott Mary? Beginning now. Scott Mary. Will you come with me? Is that so? I remember being chased away. I know. You're right. Will you? They're waiting Please... We want you to come over... On our side. So we can bring... some order which is just as much your town as ours. I've known your order but you're wasting your time. You're right, Scott. But you know me well. And you should think about Our worst problem, at the moment, is Talby. Eliminate him and then No, Murph. As far as I know Talby's done only justice. He may have killed, but only He'll kill anyone who comes Good or bad alike. But I'll chase him out of Clifton, 20 years ago... Scott. I don't want to see the two of us... face to face. Then just forget Talby. Step aside. Scott. I told you he wouldn't accept. Much worse for him. The bastard is about to die. And then... it's your turn. Why, you son of a... - Eileen. I made it. I killed Scott Mary! 'Got him! - Scott. Ah... the plan worked out. Murderers! I hope he's dead. The bastard. You're going to hell, Turner. No! Well, this time it's nothing It's murder. Hand me your gun. We'll see what the jury has to say, Nigel. You won, Talby. Obviously, it wasn't just luck. This country is developing. And Clifton along with it. But now, maybe more than ever before, you need a judge... as your friend. What's done inside the law is sometimes And I'm to believe that this Scott Mary Just like that. Absolutely. When Scott Mary used his pistol, boy, what a spectacle. Scott Mary, the wonder boy. Last three weeks he's been enjoying Doctor Cullen says, in order to extract he had to cut a muscle. In fact, we'll be holding the glass to his It's a lot of bull. When you drop dead you get a name Yeah. Just like Doc Holliday, for instance. When he died, that gun You know, if Scott Mary there's lot of folks gonna think he was able to light a match One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Champagne. We've got to celebrate. You're looking good. How's your arm? I can take care of myself. You're faster than before. Because I exercised. I pushed myself out of bed to do it. To your recovery. The marshal's star. Who did it go to? There is a new marshal, ain't there? Yeah. Murph... Allan... Short. He... might make a good sheriff. A tough one. In Clifton, I owe nothing to nobody. But to Murph, I'm very indebted. Talby! Talby! I hear you. As from today, it's forbidden Unbuckle your belt and let it drop. You better come and get it. I'm coming. I may not be as fast as I used to be, but you could lose again on account of me. No! I gave you plenty of warning, Talby. Now I'm gonna get you. &quot;Dear Scott, &quot;When you read this, &quot;I will be dead. &quot;The only thing I can leave you &quot;is this pistol. It's an old one, &quot;but it belonged to Doc Holliday. &quot;It's also been mine. Now it's yours. &quot;It's endowed with the tricks &quot;The firing pin's been modified &quot;so that all you have to do &quot;The trigger fires immediately. &quot;This pistol is now in your hands, Scott, &quot;but if you still think the way Talby does, &quot;I beg you: Throw it away.&quot; Scott. - Hey, Scott. They're coming over here. You're surrounded by They might kill you, Scott. Don't be worried. Come on out, Scott Mary. Talby wants to speak to you. Now, are you coming out immediately? I'm coming out... You never should beg another man. That's the first lesson Don't move. Drop your gun, Scott. Yeah, friend. You mustn't trust anyone. That's the second lesson. - Did you see him? Never get between a gun and its target. The right bullet at the right time. Talby. Now it's your turn. There's nobody out here left A challenge shouldn't be refused, Remember saying that to me? Sure I do, Scott Mary. You sure you want it this way, Scottie? You saw what happened to Murph. But you won't do it to me. Tell me: Did you go to church to pray? If I waited for you in the saloon, I don't believe your tricks will be enough. My gun will do it. That's where you're mistaken. If I was alone, maybe you could've done it. But not against me and Murph. Now I got a pistol that's equal to yours. Sight missing, calibrated perfectly. Your last lesson, Scottie... When you start killing, you can't stop it. Any time you're ready. Find me a horse, Scottie. I'll get out of your way. No. I'd be stupid to help you. I've learned your lessons like a good boy. When a man has been wounded, you've gotta end it. Or it might be that later You won, Murph. Scott. Scott!
