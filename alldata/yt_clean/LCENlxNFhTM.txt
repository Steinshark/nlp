Your friends are like, You're like, &quot;Busy.&quot; &quot;Super busy, I got good 8:00 PM is the overdose of early bedtime. That's when you've gone too far. You wake up 3:00, refreshed.

She kept beating me at board She beat me at Scrabble, On the fourth game night I was like, &quot;I brought Hungry, Hungry Hippo.&quot; I have a little two that is unstoppable and I brought Uno. I'll teach you the language and after that we can arm wrestle.&quot; She did defeat me at those as well. I've heard that men are intimidated to date successful women. What they don't mention are less interested in dumb losers. What's up with that ladies? Give us a chance. But the biggest argument she called me out for know what that is, if you But it made me think and I realized I wasn't We were just having a disagreement and she didn't like what I was saying. And I do think that's between a man speaking if you hate what he said, If you like what he's saying, that's just a nice man talking. And just for the sake of thought, I had to wonder about the I think it would be a that are impossible to answer. And she did that a lot. I just don't think we have Like Ladyriddling. Or a Woman's . She asked me, &quot;Who do you I was like, &quot;I thought we Now I gotta grind.&quot; And I'm looking at her, I can tell there's a lot of wrong answers. And I thought I solved it. I was like, &quot;You're both so cute.&quot; And she said, &quot;No, you have to pick.&quot; I'm like, &quot;What is the answer?&quot; Finally I said, &quot;You're the cutest woman and your cat's the cutest cat.&quot; And she was like, &quot;That's correct.&quot; I was like, &quot;That was a close call.&quot; That was way closer than anyone realizes. I know there's wrong answers 'cause we were watching her favorite show, &quot;Love Island Australia&quot; one &quot;Who do you think's And I'm like, &quot;I didn't I don't even like &quot;Love Island&quot; and now I gotta choose between And I said, &quot;Courtney,&quot; For a month she was like, &quot;Yeah.

Always asking to be excused. &quot;Please can I go back to my life? How much eating do we Kids hate meals and bedtime. That's all I have now, Right? I call those the big two. And if I ever do hang out it's never playful anymore. It's always like, &quot;Hey, I You wanna get together and eat? We could like talk and eat.&quot; Best case scenario, We don't even have to speak. We can just watch other men playing. &quot;They're playing well, I love that. Don't you love it when our They always play better when That play was unbelievable. That was so nice. Maybe after this we could play. Yeah, no you're right. We ate a lot. Sleep would be incredible. You're my best friend.

Yeah, I wish I had spent I wish I had learned more in science class because now I really liked I saw that James Webb telescope came out and like Hubble Telescope is old news now. You know, Hubble Telescope compared to James Webb. And as soon as they came there was a headline that said &quot;Universe, bigger than And I feel like we I'll be more impressed when and they're like, &quot;We overshot it. It's pretty reasonably sized. We feel bad about our last estimates.&quot; I like the science studies 'cause I feel like half of scientists are trying to save the cure cancer, and the other &quot;I wonder if orangutans &quot;No they can't.&quot; &quot;How about Bonobos? No. They're kind of playing soccer though. Let's publish it.&quot; It always made me wonder monkey scientists, like smartest smartest in college, And then the rest of &quot;Bongo, no biting.&quot; &quot;Don't you dare pull No Bubbles. No Bubbles. I love you too. I love you too Bubbles.&quot; Apparently, they struggled evolved in humans because it and then they figured it out. A study shows that sad people are better at predicting future outcomes. So if you feel bad, you're correct. Mmh-hmm, you sure are. But don't let that make you feel good because happy people So if you're happy and that you just got a little smarter. I guarantee it was a depressed person that was the first person to figure out to play dead for a bear. All his optimistic friends &quot;We can make it.&quot; He's like, &quot;I'm just &quot;It's fine. It's fine guys. I'll take this one for It just sniffs at him and goes And depression passes on Like, &quot;How'd you think &quot;I was just being myself.&quot; You know. Alarm clock at 8:00 PM. Time for bedtime.

And people have bad They say things like, &quot;Scorpios are full of They've been saying that They're like, &quot;You're wild in the sack.&quot; You're like, &quot;Am I?&quot; And then you just grow into it, you know? But I'm tired of horoscope And one thing you can I wrote down an evil historical figure for all of the other 11 star signs. So then when they give &quot;Oh, and you're a Capricorn? Those are good. Kim So that's a good one. Good for you. Way better than me.&quot; What's your horoscope, sir? - Gemini. Let me see what we got here. Gemini, ever heard of Jeffrey Dahmer? Watch out for this guy. How about you sir? What's your star sign? - Aries. Kim Jong Un's dad. And Logan Paul. Ouch! That hurts. That one stings. Anybody feel like you I see a hand over here. - Leo. Known for seeking attention. Yes. First hand up, just like Hermione Charms. Mussolini and Roman I saw another hand right behind her. - Yeah, I'm a Leo too. - Oh yeah, both are Leos. Not one other hand in the room. That's beautiful. Horoscopes. They're so real, right? They're kind of true if There's something to it. Yeah, it's 'cause people they want attention since And they're like, &quot;Oh, We'll do one more. One more. Okay. How about you sir? - Aquarius. Very rare. Jeff Epstein, so... Watch out for that guy. Yeah, yeah, I don't feel old, but I did recently identify a bird and that doesn't seem good. &quot;Is that a whip-poor-will?&quot; &quot;Why do I care and why I got into birdwatching over the pandemic, went down to Central Park. At first I did it ironically. I was like, &quot;I'm so alone.&quot; Two hours later I'm like, &quot;Martha, look at that owl, gorgeous.&quot; She's like, &quot;That's a robbin.&quot; And I'm like, &quot;I'm new, But that is gorgeous.&quot; And I actually met a He gives birding tours and I said, &quot;That sounds like a fun job.&quot; And he goes, &quot;Well you get a lot of egos.&quot; &quot;In birdwatching?&quot; And he explained that people they've identified in their career. And the best part is how they is they just say that they did. &quot;So I've seen every bird, prove I haven't. All 10,000.&quot; &quot;Oh yeah. Where'd you see the &quot;Asheville.&quot; &quot;They only live in Tasmania.&quot; &quot;Yeah. I was surprised.&quot; &quot;I was like, 'Weird, here?'&quot; Check. But if you ever meet an arrogant birder, you could actually have more fun if you went too low with your number. If they're bragging, just be &quot;Well you've seen more than two birds.&quot; &quot;I wish.&quot; &quot;Yeah. It's just been Super bad at it.&quot; &quot;How long have you been birdwatching?&quot; &quot;Four years. I don't know if I'm looking I've seen chicken nuggets, I like what is doing. They're trying to remove animal violence from figures of speech. They want us to stop saying, and they want us to replace it with &quot;Feed two birds with one scone.&quot; And that's so sweet. And I could almost see it And I want all of us to The next chance you have, no explanation. &quot;Hey, while you're grabbing gas, could you grab some milk as well? Feed two birds with one scone.&quot; &quot;What?&quot; &quot;Just grab some milk &quot;Two birds, one scone.&quot; But birds, a lot of them So if you feed two birds, one scone, you could kill two birds with one scone. Yeah, the violence remains. And I spend a lot of time in coffee shops. I know I didn't need to say And scones will get rock hard about two hours after they were fresh. So you could even kill two style as well. There's more than one way to skin a cat. I mean pet a cat. More than one way to pet Tail and back, whiskers. You can kill a bunch of Mhh-hmm, you sure can. You sure can. I was just in Arizona, and somebody told me to I didn't know what those are. We get out there, they're and there's a plaque that says, &quot;Unfortunately there's no way to translate what these mean today. However, this little And you're like, &quot;Yeah, I could see that.&quot; And then they go, &quot;And this into another world.&quot; &quot;Wow, you really took some No way to translate, but you're gonna guess portal off of that? Okay. You're not gonna guess that they were drawing Portal? All right.&quot; And this lady, I didn't see and she goes, &quot;Don't you wish and ask 'em what they really meant?&quot; And I think that's why I don't because you have to be polite. You can't be honest and be like, &quot;Actually that would be a Spend trillions of dollars on fuel. 'Hey, we're here from the We we were so curious that you did on this rock. Is that a snake? We're from the future&quot; &quot;I was trying to draw a worm.&quot; &quot;It's a worm. Good thing we time traveled Martha. &quot;Well, we're gonna head right through this circle.&quot; He's like, &quot;Whoa, cool portal.&quot; &quot;Wow. Wrong about the snake. Right about the portal. Didn't see it coming.&quot; Anytime time travel comes up, it's always a short walk Some of you familiar? It's the ethical debate. Would it be better to, to the moment Hitler was a baby, would it be better to kill Classic ethical paradox. It's Hitler. You can save a lot of people. - Kill the baby. - You're gonna kill the baby? - Yeah. Okay, that's fine. Now you saved a lot of people, but it is a baby and we do need You're a time traveling assassin. How do you do it? - A time machine, I'd - Oh yeah. I don't understand why you wouldn't wanna field this question, sir. He's requested to move where we will still No, it's cool. It's just a special, it's just a special. And it's just my first And so... Pretty much the fate If you have a good answer, If you don't answer, it's going to Quibi. What would you do? - Sorry, what's the question again? - How would you kill a baby? Gosh. It's not that complicated. If I was the time traveling assassin, I don't think I would And that's fine if you would kill a baby. I just don't think I would be able to. That's just me. But I do think I would to the time machine They're like, &quot;Why do you have a baby?&quot; I'm like, &quot;It's Hitler.&quot; &quot;Who's Hitler?&quot; I'm like, &quot;It worked.&quot; And now I just have baby Hitler. Is this why I never had kids? Was I meant to raise I would try so hard to teach him to love, find out if it's nature or He grows up, goes off to art school. I'm like, &quot;I'm so proud I still call him that.&quot; He calls me, he's like, &quot;I fell in love.&quot; I'm like, &quot;That away baby. Love wins.&quot; I guess it is nurture over nature. Couple years later he's like, &quot;She dumped me for a rabbi, I hate Jews.&quot; I'm like, &quot;Easy. Hello?&quot; &quot;Kanye was right.&quot; &quot;No boy, that is not what we teach in the Zimmerman household.&quot; I'm actually not Jewish. A lot of people ask me if I'm Jewish 'cause of my last name, I'm not. And then that is something just as a precaution.

And his book should have to be the prince, how awesome get any private jets, any But the mistake he made was he was kind of whiny in the book. He was like, &quot;My brother was mean to me. He pushed me and he hung Sounds like you have a And people feel bad for him. They're like, &quot;He was born into a job. He was born into an institution.&quot; Every human is born into a job. He's the only one born into a job where you don't have to do a job. And when he moved to I have a friend that moved parking lot in his car and after a year he moved back to Sevierville, People should feel bad for Douglas. But do they? No they do not. They make fun of Douglas. They're like, &quot;I can't believe He's like, &quot;I know I suck.&quot; Prince Harry moved to with Tyler Perry's mansion, I would like to see.

That's my Myers-Briggs. It's bad. But ultimately, I don't 'cause I don't like doing chores, which is why I was thinking Just get the gravy. And actually that's why I'm doing some recruiting and follow me. I'll teach you the meaning of life, which is to do chores for me. But you know, cult leaders But we only ever hear that got famous, the ones that made it.

I'm paying you $12 to be here. And he said, &quot;If you're too hot, you can just lay it down on your mat. You'll be fine. It'd be better for the rest of the class if you didn't leave.&quot; And I'm looking at the rest of the class. They're avoiding eye contact. So I just lay down for 70 more minutes. Just so hot and so angry. I hope I die. So this guy gets fired. I hope I die loudly. So Just furiously obedient. The class ended. I was fine unfortunately. But I went home and looked up Bikram, they're trained not to let anybody leave because once one person And I recently learned he I win the line. I hung in there for the win. Yeah.
