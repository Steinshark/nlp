The finest there is, good sense is all it takes. You say you need to plow. I have the best. You know it because it's &quot;Jones Irongoods&quot; Company. The best there is Yankee. You won't sell us Confederates one thing that's not made in Dixie. Oh, how long are you going to live in the past? Yankees, the CSA... Are you forgetting the civil war Does it make a difference where your You will see for yourselves. You can get a much better I'll offer one of you $31 to $40 a month. I want a Southerner to help Let him sell to the north! That Yankee doesn't know I'm ready to try mister. I'm willing. Now tell us why do you want to stick your I need the money. And if you think you can use me, I'll do the job for you. We can give it a try. What's your name, boy? Bill. Bill Grayson. You hear what he said? Bill Grayson. What did you say the name was? Billy Grayson. He should know. Now you don't happen to know Yes, sir. He's my father. Good gracious, is this your idea of hospitality? The man's alone. You really should try not to lose your tempers. Damn it. What was I saying. Our plows are made for the finest work. One moment, gentlemen. First I have to settle a personal matter One... and two... That's enough. He's Colonel Graysons son. You heard what I said, boys. Is it true that you are the son of Colonel Grayson? Yes, yes. He's my father. What about it? Here. You want to defend your father. I know, but you have to Fighting only makes things worse. Everyone here thinks he took that gold. The other four returned. All that money disappeared. He stole a good half million dollars. My father is no traitor, and I'll prove it to you. The wisest thing to do is go away. Let's hope it will be forgotten one day. You better just go and not come back here. I have no money and no horse. I can't give you cash, It sure took you and your thoroughbred Who are you? What do you want from me? Me first, chico. When one man is unarmed and the other has a colt, the second one asks the questions. Tell me, is your father really Grayson? That's right. I'm Bill Grayson. Do you want to fight with me? I wouldn't dream of it. You're going to help me get my hands on the gold. - What do you mean? Have a cigar. No thanks. I prefer not to. I just want to be friendly. Well. Let's see if I have still some more coffee. Are you going to tell me? You should know the truth about your father. You have a fool, don't believe those lies. I know the truth. How do you know? Because I was a scout for those officers. Then you know him. Where is he? Your father was killed, murdered by the other Florida patrol. They shot him while he was sleeping. They were forced to murder him because he was an honest man. The other four wanted the gold. Where did it happen? It's three days ride from here. They murdered your father first, and then it was my turn. They thought I was dead and they buried me. When I came to my senses, everything was black. I struggle as hard as I could and clawed my way out of that grave. The men, they like your father. Sometimes we would gather around the fire and he would tell us stories about the beginning of the war. All about &quot;bull run&quot;. A brave soldier. Fierce and courageous. A pity he had to leave on us. But you can't expect anyone to be perfect. It was the gun of your father. Who was there? Bennington, Avery, Latour, and Captain Hawkins. All right, let's go. Tomorrow, is time enough to move on. We must rest for a couple Look, Charro, I'm going. I got a lot to do on Black Point. Very bad, chico. You should take care of everything you really need. And boy, I've had to. Remember your six gun and remember your horse. You'll be all right. That guy is Joe Latour. He thinks he's safe. The last thing he's worried about is you. He bought into a bank, and the filthy cheat If you knew where he was, why didn't you kill him? And who would believe Every one of us knows his place here. Then why did you let him go? Because I happened to be in jail. My little Maria. I sealed his wounds but he dies home to Maria. That was a very sad day. How did she take it? I murdered the poor thing. She was with a friend, a gringo friend. When I arrived there, I finished that. Man... A man has his pride, am I right? But there is one thing I forgot. Jail. - Who told you? They put me in one of your prisons. You break their laws, and the first thing they do is run for the sheriff. Men are fools. I'm very sorry. Don't be. Don't waste time on tears. You know anything about the other three? I know where to look for Bennington and Avery. But, uhm... our Captain Hawkins, I know he got a place near a Mesa. I think... What is it. It's some idiot, who got himself into trouble. Come here. Look, they're going to rob the stage. Go on, shoot! Go on! What shall we do? We should stay out of trouble. It's time to go. No, I think we should help them. Just like your father. How did she get like that? I bet your face frightened her. Beware, gringo. If you stick your neck out for a woman, you could end up losing your head. But, every man must take his chances. - Will you be warm enough? Would you like another blanket? No Bill, then Chato would be cold. Oh, he wouldn't mind. What a pity, Bill, it would have been so nice if we'd met before. But I know you. No, it's impossible. I'd have remembered your kiss. Bill. I'm sure of it. Well Jenny, this is where we say goodbye. I won't ever forget you, Bill. I don't want you to, Jenny. Hey, chico. Black Point is not more close than it was. But didn't I? You passed through Laredo last August. I'm certain. No. I already told you no. But I could swear I knew that kiss. Sweet matrimony. Well friends, it finally happens to all men. Even I got caught. Just remember, I'm going to be as happy as you are. Don't forget it. Something I wanted all along. Raise your glasses. Let's make a toast to the happiness of my Abuela and Mr. Jacques Latour. I'll drink to that. Hey, senor! What time does the bank open? It's closed because Latour is getting married today. It's Latours wedding day. Hey, listen. What do you think if we invited ourselves? We shall go, he's a very old amigo. Did you bring my father's notes? But Helen, we're not married yet. You mustn't forget I need them before the wedding. Some wine, dear? You are forgetting, that now I give the orders. Why can't you take orders? You can't make me until I am your wife. Now you are still an old fool. You won't mind, if we borrow her for a while? Excuse me. Hey, boss. What is it, Sam? There's a guy who wants to deposit Tell him to come back tomorrow. The banks closed today. He wants to deposit $20,000. Well, maybe I should see him. Good morning. Good morning. Well, I see you're admiring my war decorations. I fought as best I could for we all ought to forget it. But good southerners, aren't forgetful. Yes, you're right. Well, what can I do for you, mister? The name's Saul Benson. From Nevada Way. I've $20,000 with me. I want to leave it with someone. Well, you have come to the right place, Benson. You see, I have my guests. But I'll send my assistant. He'll help you. I'd rather you take care of it personally. If you could take a minute, I'd meet you at your office Perhaps you're right, Benson, and I'll meet you Then I'll see you at three, is that all right? Fair enough, it's my pleasure. Thank you. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. You are punctual, Mr. Benson. I'm always punctual. This is a very important appointment for me. It's a family affair. Good afternoon, Lieutnant. Charro! Surprised? I bet, you never suppose you see me again after all this time. But my amigo here I refer to this son of Colonel Grayson. I came here to avenge the death of my father. Surprise. Boy, you have to be a bit faster. You want to make it a deposite, huh? Sam, Sam. Take my friends up to the cabin. I'll tell the sheriff they robbed the bank I use the money, as visual proof of the robbery. Get moving. Latour is coming. Here it is, Sam, $40,000. I've told the sheriff all about it. He's going to look for them. Down the Rio Pecos. Now we're going to have a little fun with them. This time you're going to stay dead, Charro. You should pay your men better, No, please, no. Look Sam, you want money? I'll do anything. Anything! The men have your money. You brought it. They'll tell the sheriff that they couldn't catch us. It's just a big pity Latour got killed. It's too bad about this, unfortune. Now he's yours. I don't have a gun, Grayson. Give him a gun. Well, divide that money like brothers, mojitos. Hasta la vista. Let me add some of this. It's what I told you all along. You believe it now? With a bullet talking, boy you don't have to argue You're a murderer, Charro. A real murderer. You don't mean that, do you? You know they double crossed old Latour. Now listen, we've got to take that money We got to do what? You're kidding. Too many people here in the South, lost everything after the war. And what do you think I care, if Or if you want to help a friend why not me? Listen to me, Charro it would be useless to avenge my father, if I could not also clear his name. And we can do that by stealing. Well, about time that each of us understood. Why do you think I got all mixed up Only because of this. That money, we're taking to Black Point. - Give it to me. But you have to come and take it. All right. I will. Good, I'm waiting. You are hard to frighten, Chico. Sometimes I don't understand you at all. Wait a minute, Chico. It's about time I teach you A first lesson: Stop standing around if No, it's unfair. That's that's not the way. I go by the book whenever I can. Second: Don't hit a man with your head. That's not fair, either. All right, then we have a fair fight. Fine. That's the third: Don't forget to smile. You know what? That was a good kick. And fourth... That, I learned from my grandmother. I bet you did. Must have been a rough teacher, the old lady. 29th: Head clear, reflexes ready. I'm afraid I hurt you. I was about to say the same to you. You really have to learn I'll teach you. Just let me know when you are ready, when you are. I promise that even if you are a hopeless case, I will teach you something. Anything for that money? Boy, look over that way. A kiss from one of those $200. That's what it's going to cost you And I won't ask any questions. Thanks. And after I've come all this way to ask a favor of an old friend. What do you mean? This is my house. You think I'd be asking you if it wasn't? I've still got to live some place. Remember? But you're wasting your time, you know that. You won't be able to get in. Bennington and Avery, Well it would be like child's play to kill you. Those two won't let you get near them. I wouldn't be too sure of that. If they're willing to play, we are too. Right, Charro? Just so, Chico. But they won't understand that Don't talk like that. Do you hear what's waiting for you at the French palace? Well, that's why we're here. You tell us everything. Now you're making little sense. It won't be easy, I mean it. If you want to get out of that now you listen to me. Whoever walks in the French palace First, there is &quot;Big Burt&quot;, outside Bennigan's office. He shoots with both hands, so there's two guys right there. The third one is hidden behind the painting of a naked girl. The fourth is hidden under The bartender's got the fith one. He can shoot through a hole in the bar. Are you drinking, mister? What do you give me for a Just hold. I will kill the pain. Tequila, whiskey, apple juice, with a little bit of gunpowder in it. Well, if it helps. Hey, watch where you're going! You spilled that rotten stuff all over me, Get out of here. Mexicans don't belong in a saloon. And you get go on. help. Sheriff, sheriff, where are you? Sheriff, my house is on fire. What's going on? You got to do something. While there's still something to do. Let's get. Help. Get anyone who can, and see that they bring plenty of buckets. I warn them at the Party's over, there's work to be done. Josef's house is on fire. We got no time to lose. Come on, men. What are you waiting for? Come on, let's go. (talking in confusion) Let's go. We can't let it spread! Sheriff! Yes, Mr. Avery. I'm listening. Where's everyone going? Old Sam's house is burning to the ground. Oh, just let it burn. Who will say anything? If we do that, You better go then. See you later. Give me whiskey. Hey, shouldn't you be out there with the others? Do you know of a dentist who is good but painless? No, there's Is he painful? Yeah, I'm a four time loser. Don't you move! Hands up, mister. Put those hands up, I said! Put them up! Don't try it. If you don't want a bullet in your gut. Get those hands up and turn around. Hands up, pretty boy. You move them hands and you're dead. They are upstairs. You go ahead. One more step and I'll blow your brains out. Why do you want to throw away your stinking life. Listen mister, get out of the way. I don't want to have to kill you. Be smart. Let me buy my way out. Who's paying you, boy? Whatever you get paid, you get more if you let me get through. Than my reputation would start to smell a little. All right. You... I know you. Benito, that makes two. You never waste any time, do you Charro? I just figured we could use it to pay back what you did to Old Zebulon's house, chico. Gracias amigo. Checkmate. Lyman? Lyman! Blackie! - How have you been? We'll play. Come on, Lou. You don't mind Lou? This here's the best doggone Last time we played I lost $20, now I'm going to try to win it back. - What do you say? You'll get a chance to win it back, this time instead, all business. I'm on a case. What kind of case? There was a big, saloon robbery down in Warlock. The two who did it got away. My best guess is, that they're I don't know. The &quot;Muir Trail&quot; is the only one Better for you and me. I know every inch of that trail, right Paco? Yes. Charro, couldn't we have taken another trail? Sure, why not, chico? It might have been easier but then the sheriff and all of his deputies You're right. I'm just anxious to find Hawkins. I'm as anxious as you are, but you know, with what we got from So what do you say It'll be very nice in Mexico, and it's just across the border. What do you say? Don't start that again.

This is what's hurting, but the feeling is in the body, not the spirit. Now would you mind telling Last house down the road. I've got to go and bring the horses. - You go ahead. I drunk a lot of bourbon. You're in a bad way. Satan and Sin are waiting You're on the wrong track. You can't go on like this. Your soul is ill. - In the psalms it is written. Please, the scripture will wait, won't it? Yeah. Sure. Up you go, my son. Thanks, Padre. I wish I could do more. The Lord watches over us. I only hope that right now he's not looking this way. Adios.

Bill I can't let you rest now. They must be on our trail. How do we get through it? We'll cut them off there. Hold it! Put your hands up. You move a finger and I kill you. Watch out. And the money? Is gone with our horses. Once they cross the river, we can rest. But first, we got to do some walking. Let's try it. Why do you suppose they let the horses go? They didn't let them go. No, sir, not without this. We better try to get to the river. Are you sure to head over there. We'll have to leave Frank behind. That way, we're sure to get them. One way or the other. You got that, Frank? You stay behind. Are you all right? I can't go any further. You better go on. You have got to, the river is near here. Wait here. I'll be back. I found one of them. You better not. You'll bring on the sheriff. Come on, great. Let's go. Come on. Can you imagine we're going to go Looks like they've already gotten across. We can't waste a minute, they're going to get away. We can't let them do that. There must be another way to cross it. There is, but it's over two miles. Remember, they haven't got horses. We can go a lot faster. I think we just might make it. Yeah, I'm with you. Come on. What are you talking about? I already told Milo want's the knife. Yea, but my relatives stay loud. The little girl, she brought a cat with her. What's wrong with that? I hate little girls. I hate my mother a lot more No, you don't. - I hate mine more! Of course, that's easy to say. What is it? You think I don't know? What do you tell me a thing like that for? I still say you don't listen to her talk. She's got a big voice. - You have to be fair... I'd sold them all out! With all of their clothes and and all that they own! The only solution. - I'm going to tell them. or I kick them right out! I've had enough. I'm really mad. Let me tell you about my relatives. No, leave me alone. - You got me mad. Mine are terrible, I don't want to hear about it! They're like animals. Well, good morning sheriff. We're looking for two men who just crossed the river near here. One is a Mexican. No, they didn't pass us, we were just down - You see anyone? Anything we can do? Oh, you just keep watching. Adios. - Adios. Now, if you breathe a word of what I said, Oh, what are you worried about I completely forgot about what you were saying. You think I go around worrying about your problems? What is it His mother law? What did I tell you? You say one more word and I'll... - Adios. When you see miss Dolly, tell her 'hello' from me, will you? Mrs. Dolly! Don't be afraid. It'll be all right. Well. Oh, no, please don't shoot. You have got to help me He's your brother? We were... we were raised together. Look at him, he's so pale. If you could only help us, it has been just terrible. I know it's asking too much, if only you would senorita? You're cooking is something else that you've learned to do well. Did you know we had a visit from the sheriff? The sheriff? And what did he want here? I don't know. He talked to senorita Dolly for a while. But I didn't hear what he said. When does Mr. Stewart arrive. Tomorrow, I think. Tomorrow, we'll have to go. I don't want you to go away. I'll talk to father. If only you didn't have to go. The Sheriff of Growthpoint. What do you suppose he wants? Never mind. Let me take care of it. - Where's miss Dolly? Senorita Dolly! Morning sheriff. Morning. You back already? Anything wrong? No, nothing to worry about. We're only passing through. Have you seen any strangers? I'm certain. Has your father come back yet? No, we're expecting him tomorrow, though. Sorry to bother you again. Tell him to make sure to see me later. Don't worry. Where the hell did they go? Every day that goes by, This time, I'm afraid you're on your own. I think I better start heading So I'll be heading back to Warlock. - Good luck, Blackie. Are you crazy? Where have you been all this time? Looking for a lost love, amigo. You suppose that's the right moment? Well, since you're asking. It depends, doesn't it? Lyman. I'm happy to have them home again. You should let me have the money. We'll have to hide it. Oh no, this coat has no hole. Is that Lyman's? No, it was offered to us by the hotel, for bedtime. I wanted to find out what it feels like to go to bed using a cushion of $100,000. Good night, Chico. Don't move, Chico. This is the most difficult part, nice and smooth, that's lovely. You mustn't be rough on a lady. After a few days, you'll be better We'll have to leave. You don't have to stay for me. I'll be all right. Go on. You're forgetting that we must still find Hawkins. He's important for you. You don't think you can find him Do you? - Good morning. - Hello. I didn't bring anything for you because I know you don't like milk. Only babies drink milk. I know where I get something better. Much better. Careful Charro, my father will be coming back today. Oh, don't worry, senorita. What on earth are we going to do? Anything else, Mr. Stewart? No, you men get some rest. Let's go. Good evening, Captain Hawkins. I'm very pleased to see my old friend, so well taken care of. Charro. Fine memory, captain, but I too, have important reasons, I guess that you're special to me. By the way, sir. What was it that ever happened to all that money? I don't know. You find it, or else. Be still. You can't have what I haven't got. Then you make me an offer. For what you have got. It's yours. If you take what I have here and then go. Very well, captain. Now I feel friendlier. All right, now sit at the table over there. That's good. I'll just add this. Now pick up the pen and The pen. All right. &quot;I, Jack Hawkins,&quot; Don't worry. I know him well, he won't say no. He's always giving in to whatever I ask. Bill, I know he'll say yes. Pa is dead... Pa is dead. I didn't want you see this. It was just bound to be. What are you saying? Captain Hawkins, he killed Colonel Grayson. Now your father's name is cleared. Here is his own confession I must leave you to comfort each other and to everyone his own. Hasta la vista! Yeah. And everyone his own. Oh Bill. Get off your horse. Chico. Let's not play, I almost got killed, you know? What's the matter with you? You surprise me, Charro. &quot;When a man is disarmed &quot;it's the second one, who asks the questions.&quot; What is it? Haven't I done enough for you? Sure. And I'm real grateful to you. Get over there. And everyone his own. What the hell are you doing? Giving it to the government? You idiot. Why is it you haven't understood? It's mine. Just say that again. I've never known, nor have I ever seen Colonel Grayson. You are not his son? Who are you then? Just someone who was looking Then I heard about Colonel Grayson. I needed help. And when you came, I knew I'd found someone. Have a cigar. Hasta la vista, Charro. I remember what you told me, Charro. &quot;A good gun,&quot; &quot;and a good horse.&quot; Ain't that waht you're saying? Oh, yeah, forgot.
