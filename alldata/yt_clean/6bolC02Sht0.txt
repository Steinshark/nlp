Man this is fun, No sports, people just come to the show. Fresh, I like that. I hate it when people I have to hope that your team has won It's just too much Last week the springboks lost people came to the show, There's just like a row of Afrikaans guys, It was like I was the ref. They are sitting there in I mean it could have been the Look, because I don't know I only know a few guys, They are there, super angry. Afrikaans people get super angry &quot;The bloody ref! He robbed &quot;Bloody guy giving out yellow cards I'm like, who gets yellow &quot;That's not the point! Shut up, What a horrible Christmas that would be. &quot;Merry Christmas!&quot; &quot;10 minutes. Go away, go away!&quot; I am not surprised when the I am not surprised when because rugby itself is a very angry I always get weird-ed out, the they are crunching and You know, it's weird for me That is the weirdest thing, &quot;Hey guys, stop. Come on, we don't need and they go play the game. *sound of players bashing into each other* &quot;That's better.&quot; People walk off the field, One guy came back on with a bandage. Why would you come, you are bleeding. Just sit, you are bleeding. Like, blood is your body's that's what your body is saying and you come back, Where is your mom? Just sit down and relax. &quot;No, I want to play rugby!&quot; You are not playing rugby, that's what they should say. &quot;I suffer rugby every Saturday.&quot; Such a rough sport. and then you get these ministers that are like, &quot;We demand a quota system.&quot; &quot;We want more black players and black people are like, &quot;Maybe you&quot; &quot;You go, yes you go.&quot; &quot;Me, I am here. &quot;Me, I am here.&quot; &quot;Quota system, no, no, no.&quot; Ah, it's tough. People get angry at the Springbok's, Just one game and They are like an A student that Whereas if Banana loses, *Laughing* Oh, Bafana Bafana. We have become Like anything is enough for us, Yea, Bafana is like our We are just there like, "Hey, welcome "What happened? You got a D? "Well done boy, boy." "Got a D hey?" "At least you finished the test this time." "Well done Bafana's." Bafana Bafana, that's what they do. They Drawing is a win for They lose, although they won. They won their last qualifier match Bafana Bafana beat Botswana. Yes, the great Destroyed them! Two goals to one. They won't mess with us again. I am glad Bafana won, I am glad. It was a weird match though, we were in And it was a weird day, because Banana won. But then they weren't through yet In order for them to go through. Which is always weird. Bafana does that to us, you It's so much stress. Now you And so Bafana won, but those people in the So they were happy, they were cheering. The people were happy, the guy in the stadium went, "Well done Bafana Bafana" The people, "Yay!" "Unfortunately" "Ethiopia has qualified for It was the first time in my life I heard It sounded like an animal Because one minute it was there, confident. *confused and disappointed vuvuzela sound* But it's good that they won, they needed to win. The only reason I want Bafana to win is Xenophobia goes up in South Africa. This is a trend I have noticed. It even happens at the matches. Beat them. And then as the Zambian The Bafana fans started throwing Yes, throwing stones. Thousands of Fans. They could have hurt the people badly. I don't Because they didn't win. But they were throwing at the Zambians. Could have hurt them. Nobody was hurt though, luckily. Because Bafana fans were just like, Just couldn't hit the target. *sound Xenophobia always go up, yes. It's gotten so bad that foreigners have You will go to the matches and see giant "______________" "______________" "______________" "______________" You are like, "Yo man, you are He's like, "I support my life, hey." "Don't worry about me I support my life. ______________." It's tough, it's tough out there. It's good times though, good times. The Bafana vs Botswana. A lot of people came out to the There where Dignitaries, a lot of politicians the ANC was out in full force and the DA didn't come. &quot;We don't do soccer, thank you. The ANC was there, Jacob Zuma was because elections are coming up so you There waving. Yeah, you going to You're going to see him Yeah, he is going to be out mostly his babies, but still. &quot;Vote for me.&quot; Because he knows he has the ANC's having a This is one of the worst times in ANC history. Highest levels of corruption, The ANC is just a shadow Yeah, people in the ANC They stand there &quot;No man, no man, No, enough man, no.
