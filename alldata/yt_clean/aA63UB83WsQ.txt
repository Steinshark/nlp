I was honestly scared for Reem because it's the first time she rides it. -As for me, I'm used to it. Were you scared a lot or little bit this time? I was just a bit scared, not like before. We're watching ourselves. The scariest part is when you feel like you're flying. It is when you want to go back to the ground. Yes. -Thank God for your safety. Let's go carry on playing, girls.
