Hi, I'm Michael. This is Lessons from the Screenplay. True Detective and Se7en share a number of They both feature an investigation into a They both bring their characters and the audience worst horrors imaginable. And they both have themes which are ultimately So today I want to talk about how these themes How they are expressed in the beliefs of the and the serial killers they are hunting. And examine how exploring the darkest parts Let's take a look at True Detective and Se7en. In her book, Creating Character Arcs, author K.M. Weiland discusses the important connection "Not only does character arc directly influence it is also a direct influence on theme. In some respects, we might even go so far So before we examine character arc, let's There are many ideas explored in both True as they ponder morality and religion and philosophy. But I think there is one central theme that and influences the story structure. At the beginning of the November 1st, 1994 there is a quote from Ernest Hemingway, which &quot;Ernest Hemingway once wrote, 'The world is I agree with the second part.&quot; I think these lines concisely summarize the The world is not a fine place. It's filled with inescapable pain and terrible But there is also good, and at the end of So now that we have an idea of what the theme beginning with the beliefs of the protagonist. &quot;Where you headed?&quot; &quot;Far away from here.&quot; Somerset has become cynical. He's repulsed by the apathy he sees every and he believes that he can't go on fighting In True Detective, Rustin Cohle very clearly &quot;I think the honorable thing for our species &quot;Stop reproducing.&quot; &quot;Walk hand-in-hand into extinction.&quot; At the beginning of their stories, Cohle has and Somerset has succumb to apathy. But why are they this way? There's always some experience that has shaped This is often called the character's ghost. A character's ghost, also referred to as their is something in their past that haunts them. In their book &quot;The Negative Trait Thesaurus, Angela Ackerman and Becca Puglisi point out that... &quot;Wounds are often kept secret from others an untruth that the character believes about Self-blame and feelings of shame are usually generating fears that compel him to change in order to keep from being hurt again.&quot; Both Cohle and Somerset have ghosts that feed and both have to do with their children. &quot;You believe in ghosts?&quot; Two-thirds of the way through Se7en, Tracy--Detective They discuss her hatred of living in the city, Somerset then reveals the only specific piece his ghost. &quot;I had a relationship once, it was very much &quot;I remember thinking, 'how can I bring a child &quot;'How can a person grow up with all this around The conflict within his ghost is directly Then comes the part of his ghost that haunts &quot;I told her I didn't want to have it, and In this final part of the scene, we see a &quot;I'm positive that I made the right decision.&quot; &quot;But there's not a day that passes that I The inherent contradiction in these lines his beliefs...with the theme. In True Detective, Cohle's ghost also has &quot;I was married, Marty, for three years.&quot; &quot;We had a baby girl.&quot; &quot;She died.&quot; &quot;Car accident, she was two years old.&quot; And just like with Somerset, Cohle's ghost Cohle: &quot;You know, I think about my daughter now...&quot; &quot;You know, what she was spared.&quot; &quot;Sometimes I feel grateful.&quot; In struggling with the pain of losing his into something he's grateful for. And in order to feel like your child was spared one has to believe that existence is a burden. The ghosts for both Cohle and Somerset establish and hint that somewhere deep inside they both With these starting beliefs established, it's of change. And in both Se7en and True Detective, one is their partners. At this point, it has become almost cliche to be partnered up, but it's a great way to generate conflict. And when it's done well, it's not just that the characters can't stand odd-couple traits, it's because they have intrinsically different This allows for their conflict to be a discussion In Se7en, Somerset and Mills have very different After all his years on the force, Somerset while Mills... &quot;You actually fought to get reassigned here.&quot; &quot;I've just never seen it done that way before.&quot; &quot;I thought I could do some good.&quot; Slowly, Mills helps rekindle Somerset's passion, reminding him why he finds value in being a cop. Until finally, toward the end of the second &quot;You say that 'The problem with people is &quot;It makes no sense.&quot; &quot;I don't think you're quitting because you believe &quot;I don't.&quot; &quot;I think you want to believe them, because This gets to Somerset. It shakes his beliefs ever so slightly, enough that he takes his metronome--the device a symbol of apathy--and throws it across Just as in Se7en, Cohle and Hart do not get &quot;Every time I think you've hit a ceiling you &quot;You are like the Michael Jordan of being Throughout the series, Hart serves to show &quot;You're funny, Marty.&quot; &quot;The shit you get soft about.&quot; But it's not necessarily the partner's job beliefs are wrong. In fact, the main character's beliefs should and Hart's definitely do not move Cohle. &quot;I just want you to stop saying odd shit.&quot; &quot;Like you smell a psycho-sphere or your in &quot;Just stop.&quot; &quot;Given how long its taken me for to reconcile your account, Marty.&quot; It's only by truly overcoming the antagonist And True Detective demonstrates this in an It gives the characters a false victory. Cohle and Hart think they've gotten the killer And afterward, they each have a period that &quot;Pretty good, for awhile.&quot; But it's not happily ever after, because their The real killer is still out there. Both Cohle and Hart have gotten what they By 2012, Hart even seems to realize this, &quot;You know, I cleaned up.&quot; &quot;But maybe I didn't change.&quot; &quot;Not the way I needed to.&quot; This false victory is one of the great benefits Se7en takes place over seven days, True Detective Se7en is a two hour film, True Detective is This extra time allows for the two characters go their separate ways for a decade, and then reunite to finish what they began seventeen And in order to finish it, they must overcome As Nic Pizzolatto, writer of True Detective, &quot;I thought we could make room for one more On the spectrum of thematic orientation, Somerset But the beliefs of the antagonists--the serial are in many ways similar to the protagonists. &quot;We see a deadly sin on every street corner, &quot;We tolerate it because it's common.&quot; &quot;It's trivial.&quot; &quot;We tolerate it morning, noon, and night.&quot; Both Somerset and John Doe are disgusted by and people's apathy toward it. Similarly, the serial killer in True Detective, He's not a dumb, out-of-control murderer. He's self-educated and seemingly well-versed &quot;My ascension removes me from the disc in This is a reference to the flat circle idea back in 1995... &quot;You'll do this again.&quot; &quot;Time is a flat circle.&quot; COHLE: &quot;What's that, Nietzsche?&quot; &quot;Shut the fuck up.&quot; In regards to this flat circle idea, Nic Pizzolatto &quot;Childress believes the murders ritually enacted permit him an ascension that removes him from Childress wants to ascend and escape this And Cohle has always been struggling with and by the end of the series there are moments &quot;My life's been a circle of violence and degradation &quot;I'm ready to tie it off.&quot; Both Rustin Cohle and Errol Childress believe and want to escape this life, one way or another. Having the protagonists come face to face an extreme version of themselves, is a way to force them to re-evaluate their So as they go into act three, there is only The final battle. Se7en has, in my opinion, one of the most As Somerset and Mills drive out into the middle it seems impossible to guess how John Doe And what happens next leads to one of the &quot;What's in the fucking box?&quot; &quot;He just told you.&quot; While the scene is masterfully crafted for it's the last decision made by Mills that There were actually several different versions For example, in one draft I read, Somerset kills John Doe before Mills can pull the trigger. This, apparently, was done to try to make But I feel this would have robbed the film which occurs in the final scene where Mills The captain asks Somerset... &quot;Where are you gonna be?&quot; And Somerset, despite all he's experienced go exactly as planned, says... &quot;Around.&quot; &quot;I'll be around.&quot; In fact, it's not despite what he's experienced, Somerset is changed. His beliefs have been moved, not even toward but simply to the point where he won't give And with his arc completed, the theme is fully &quot;Ernest Hemingway once wrote, 'The world is &quot;I agree with the second part.&quot; COHLE: &quot;On your knees, now!&quot; &quot;No.&quot; In the final battle of True Detective, Cohle and is invited deeper into the twisted mind &quot;Come on inside, little priest.&quot; Cohle is stabbed by Childress and a fight ...and Cohle saves Hart's. The horrific journey that these two men have but in the end they did what they needed to And through this catharsis, Cohle changes. &quot;It's just one story.&quot; &quot;The oldest.&quot; &quot;Light versus dark.&quot; &quot;It appears to me that the dark has a lot And in the last lines of True Detective, Cohle dramatic shift in belief, and fully expresses the theme. &quot;You know, you're looking at it wrong, the &quot;How's that?&quot; &quot;Well, once there was only dark.&quot; &quot;If you ask me, the light's winning.&quot; Examining True Detective and Se7en shows how having a clear understanding of your theme can guide the decisions you make when creating And that when the design of the characters, it provides a cohesion that makes for enjoyable I sometimes step back and think about the I wonder why I enjoy films and shows that the atrocities we can inflict on each other. But I think that True Detective and Se7en of profound optimism. They show us that someone can be subjected and rather than fall victim to it, come out the other side with an even stronger resolve to keep fighting. To not give in to apathy. To make sure the light keeps winning. Hey guys! You may have noticed that I've mentioned the Creating Character Arcs by K.M. Weiland a couple times now. I've been really enjoying it.
