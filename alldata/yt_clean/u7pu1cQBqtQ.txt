&quot;OHHHH&quot; &quot;That's insane!!&quot; Today I'm testing out some insane tech and let me start from the beginning... [REWIND] Okay. Think of your favorite movie. Have you ever seen how they filmed it? weird. The tech behind how they make movies these And it's not just HollywoodI It's gotten to the point be totally sure what's real... and what's not. I'm not in my studio right now, full of the tech behind my favorite movies. with Marques Brownlee who knows &quot;The old rules about how are basically rewritten. You ZeroSpace has given us full of amazing movie-making toys. three truly wild tech tools that are changing how you and we can use them. &quot;This might be a very expensive &quot;Let's do it!&quot; &quot;Hey everyone! If you want to come over here... that'd be really helpful... Hello Cleo and Marques, thank you for coming we're super excited to have you The first tool that we get to play with is taking Welcome to the XR stage. In its simplest form, an XR stage is a giant on it, which is what you saw me doing at the start studio trick that we tried to pull on you: This is my perspective just on Maybe one of the reveal takes that we I just walk in? [Laughing] I'm like lost, what's going? Marques pulled a similar trick on his channel... Is this rolling already? Hey what's up MKBHD here, So what would you use this for? We would just design awesome sets over The XR stage is already amazing but we haven't even gotten to the new part yet. more like an old movie, where they'd use a still another place, like driving scenes and classic &quot;rear projection technique.&quot; You see how in this shot with closer shift at a different speed than the ones even if you didn't know its name you can tell XR stage actually solves this problem because in the background and perfectly match it to the So before we just had our a flat 2D plain reference image. entire background and there's a lot more going was actually a background. This is parallax. And the things in the foreground move differently I thought that an LED screen actor, but it has these kind of overlaid boxes... Like moving windows... Yeah! This moving window is camera sees. the window adjusts perfectly which it can do because it This little gadget top of the camera, what's giving them the position information... Now, you might be thinking, &quot;Hello there!&quot; &quot;That's been around forever, and it also allows you The problem though with green visual effects teams in Hollywood have And you can see it in this behind the scenes reflection on the shield? That is called spill, especially if you have a character who, let's [HEY MANDO] With an XR stage, the lighting looks No green spill. No matter how The spill problem is so real. or blue screens or any of that, it works and really this good and you have the lights matching the room is just matching perfectly, This is how they shot Disney's The Mandalorian using an XR stage they call &quot;The Volume,&quot; which &quot;Mando's got a reflective armor. If we weren't be replacing all of his armor with CG armor.&quot; That is Richard Bluff, You might have seen his work in little or Star Trek or Iron Man... &quot;So the scene with Mando walking into what we call the safe house, that for us was an In this scene, the walls, the ceiling, all virtual, but characters inside. Of course, some things in these Here's another example: Can you tell where the Figuring out what to make real an interesting challenge. &quot;- taking a a cookie cutter which is the slicing it straight through &quot;It's extension of the real. So they'll have sand on the &quot;But it also must mean that you can A big benefit of this? Just change like time of day... That is a big deal. The power to change backgrounds &quot;If we were Star Wars movie, maybe we would lot, but for the Mandalorian, we only had three yet we wanted to tell a Star Wars story that different planets. But utilizing we could load different sets up And that brings us to the coolest thing closely, you may have noticed there's not just one are two cameras filming at the &quot;...it must be showing different things to &quot;How are you showing different &quot;The wall is actually refreshing at 120 then the other camera is &quot;So why is what he just said so interesting?&quot; &quot;That's incredible. Okay. So. 120 frames per second what they show every other frame...&quot; &quot;It's like if you and I were blinking &quot;That's really clever tech. So you can point two cameras at they will see completely different things.&quot; The best way to watch this in &quot;This camera is probably... oh look at that! It's And a blue screen on that one!&quot; And here's my favorite part: You sees the correct color reflections too! &quot;That's insane!&quot; &quot;That's... [shook].&quot; And it's not just two cameras. This wall can go up a minimum of 180 frames per second 30 frames per second and &quot;That's the fun we've been able pushing the boundaries of We could have played on the XR stage all day high tech movies that's &quot;Pleasure to meet you&quot; &quot;Same!&quot; &quot;I'm gonna give you this suit&quot; &quot;Okay&quot; &quot;If you could put this on...&quot; &quot;Getting in the game!&quot; &quot;I'm now a completely velcro human. &quot;20... 22... 24... 26... 28. 28 dots!&quot; &quot;36 now.&quot; &quot;54...&quot; &quot;60 independent tracking orbs....&quot; These motion capture or performance capture suits, or Planet of the Apes or Lord of the Rings. The being tracked by a handful of cameras around us, movement to any character we wanted including by getting scanned inside &quot;So what are we about to go do?&quot; &quot;We're about to scan ourselves Once we had our scans, a few minutes to calibrate so we started playing [FLEXING VERY HARD] &quot;Flexing? Are you a bodybuilder?&quot; &quot;You're The Rock.&quot; &quot;Yep. I'm The Rock.&quot; &quot;Ok, you do a celebrity.&quot; &quot;Okay. Alright, ready?&quot; &quot;Yeah.&quot; [LOSES IT] &quot;Who was that?&quot; &quot;You just won. That was amazing.&quot; &quot;Oh! Chill, my face is in there.&quot; [Laughing] [Laughing] &quot;Wait Cody, you gotta see -&quot; These suits were awesome, but I had a big the latest Avatar and how they put actors in Kate Winslet said she held her breath for My question was: &quot;Why did the &quot;Some of it might just be a physics thing. When I shot out of the bus and I was on like a cable. You and then you land, and it's it's 90% convincing &quot;Ahahah. Ah that's hot!&quot; &quot;So I feel like putting the actual actors &quot;What you try to do with motion capture is So if the scene is supposed to be underwater, you If you're thinking &quot;Cool for Hollywood but what about me?&quot; &quot;This looks like the setup for Avatar 1 you're doing it right now with an iPhone.&quot; &quot;That's kind of where my mind goes so like when you look at the future of a tech, on one hand better and better but on the other more and more accessible &quot;You can almost already do a lot of this over time you're right it's going to become more Some of the implications of are a little mind-bendy. Marques &quot;Marques, we've now made you into Cleo.&quot; &quot;I am Cleo!&quot; &quot;He could do anything!&quot; &quot;I mean, I trust you, but I'm glad this &quot;Yeah. I AM CLEO. I have all the power. Okay, I know he doesn't really look like me in more realistic versions of this are getting close &quot;If that tech really is photo real, an actor's IP of their retirement they're still acting in movies.&quot; Or imagine for example a their choreographer dances &quot;Are we mad at that? Is that weird?&quot; &quot;Weirdly I'm not that mad about it...&quot; &quot;Cause like if you're a stunt double in a movie, look like it was you but it wasn't really you&quot;... &quot;The reason I don't mind when I assume that Scarlett Johansson isn't jumping still assume that she's actually the one acting The Rock was physically there on the shoot or if &quot;Yeah they just grab his likeness from the motion capture, drop him does the body movements. Is that the future?&quot; &quot;Or it could be hundreds of videos but you just type in your script and you &quot;Man! I don't know if I like that. If there's a world does level the playing field but it also feels I felt really mixed. For one thing, the &quot;Would it be advantageous to me if I had a digital double that looked like I'm 30? comfortable with, in a way that's like worth it, allowing myself to age and then I'm giving into &quot;Right. These are the gray areas.&quot; We could get lost in these gray areas. But we had felt most like it might change how Marques and &quot;Marques, Cleo, come on in to the &quot;Sure! Ok so we're in.&quot; This is volumetric video. By placing it creates a real-time 3D hologram which allows &quot;You don't need to put on a suit, you don't you step into this volume you &quot;So how many cameras are we &quot;For this demo, there's six cameras.&quot; &quot;The camera angle I'm looking &quot;That's right.&quot; &quot;It's a stitch of the six.&quot; I liked beaming in and out of places sure but tech could be used on YouTube that blew my mind: &quot;This is one of those things where like people have asked, &quot;Marques what is the few future make videos as realistic as possible which is device in your hands and it almost feels like device in your hands so I'm now holding flat version of that which is 360 video. I did moving through my studio and you could look sphere but you couldn't like look to the side didn't do that. And so this is like an added &quot;Thank you so much, this is so so cool.&quot; &quot;Beam us out, Scotty!&quot; 50 years ago, the idea that with my own little digital camera, totally unthinkable. Today made me wonder what I don't know. But from what we've learned today, I more people's creativity. We're just going to tech are allowing creators to tell stories that pace and a budget that's just been unheard of. As the screen or how many dots or how many cameras. &quot;There's lots and lots of stories we just for the technology that exist today.&quot; So the only question left is: What story will you tell? &quot;I'm gonna have Cleo choreograph an MKBHD even touch, I won't lift a finger, Coming soon, our next collab...
