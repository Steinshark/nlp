<i> NARRATOR: Taronga Zoo is home (hooting) <i> They come in all shapes,</i> <i> sizes,</i> <i> and temperaments.</i> (hooting) <i> And while they all like <i> there's one species that REBECCA: There are over 100 They're all very unique but I guess ringtail lemurs You might notice they have 13 black and 13 white stripes and it always ends which is just a fun fact. They use their tail for balance. They also keep their tails when they're walking a little bit like a flag. So, they can all band <i> NARRATOR: And for these <i> being in a close-knit group</i> <i> means they do REBECCA: Grooming is really It's how they bond They do have a grooming, uh, tooth comb with their teeth so basically through that tooth comb. They tend to sleep so often you can't see how many They kind of tuck and they really hold on tight. So, this is Bamboo, <i> NARRATOR: Every day, keeper <i> with some human interaction.</i> REBECCA: Good boy. He's a great leaper. Come on. Good boy. <i> NARRATOR: But when it comes <i> not even their preferred treats</i> <i> can drag them away REBECCA: So, a natural behavior is that they absolutely We call it sun worshiping. They sit on their bum, they hold and they soak up all that sun. They love it. Here we've got, you know, We've got Dia and Andre here, and they're all sitting around so it's a very social thing <i> NARRATOR: But, just like us,</i> <i> a day in the sun REBECCA: This is Andriba. About a week ago, um, Andriba presented The wound hasn't healed too <i> NARRATOR: The wound <i> because of Andriba's history <i> so today he's got an WOMAN: Once he's stabilized, we'll get you KIMBERLY: Andriba's who has had a malignant melanoma The tumor he had before It was about maybe really round and raised. And I didn't get great margins, so the fact that that tumor Just have a feel of his abdomen. <i> NARRATOR: And Kimberly's <i> that the cancer's returned.</i> KIMBERLY: So, they can spread and some of the other organs. WOMAN: All right, REBECCA: It's always hard up to the vet block, um, especially when they have to but they're I've got every faith LIZ: We're just <i> NARRATOR: Given his age, <i> could be terrible news <i> Taronga's two zoos <i> all working closely KEEPER: No cuts here today? KEEPER: Good boy. <i> NARRATOR: It takes years of KEEPER: Good boy. <i> NARRATOR: But like any job <i> you have to start somewhere.</i> HARMONY: As a trainee keeper, Um, there's so much to learn. I'm learning something new I've been here and I'm still getting surprised I started my traineeship <i> NARRATOR: Trainee keeper <i> how to look after <i> for the last few months.</i> HARMONY: As a trainee keeper, it's great to learn of working with all KEEPER: This is John. He's a native budgerigar. <i> NARRATOR: But not all birds <i> and eat from your hand.</i> <i> Today Harmony <i> with the most dangerous bird <i> the southern cassowary.</i> HARMONY: They are the second so they're definitely not <i> NARRATOR: And taking Harmony <i> is keeper Corrine.</i> CORRINE: All you have to do to just be They're our direct link Those prehistoric feet and they have a dagger-like claw Now, that claw can grow and then they can use to jump up and kick out, and they can do a lot of damage so that's what classifies them I personally, I would keep my distance, um, because I know <i> NARRATOR: Because <i> trainee keepers must be closely CORRINE: All right, Harmony, This is where we feed out HARMONY: Yep. CORRINE: They also come in here They've got a lovely heater if the temperatures I'm teaching her how to safely all the protocols Because they are you always want to make sure are actually secured. We also always want between the two bowls here They can pick and they don't need to compete HARMONY: One of the notes was remain calm and that's because they are to be that close to. Their height CORRINE: The apple and pears into the food hopper here. HARMONY: Okay. CORRINE: We actually have here through the door, so we can actually see when we need to call them in. So, if you want they might actually be So, you can see our male She's going to come up So, we know they're out there. They're ready, they're keen, So, here comes Macca. HARMONY: A female. Okay. CORRINE: And if you'll notice, she's a lot larger HARMONY: Okay. So, is that how you tell CORRINE: Absolutely. So, come on in, Mac. Macca... HARMONY: She seems CORRINE: ...is HARMONY: Okay. CORRINE: It's one and is part of the protein so as a reward HARMONY: Yep. CORRINE: ...just gently HARMONY: Oh, she's very gentle. CORRINE: She is She's dropped the egg, She'll pick that up HARMONY: They eat better CORRINE: I would not HARMONY: No. (laughs) CORRINE: We might just sprinkle in here for her. HARMONY: Yep. So, because she is gentle, you're able to open that CORRINE: Absolutely. HARMONY: Can I ask what CORRINE: The thing on her head, HARMONY: Casque. Okay. I've been calling it That's embarrassing. Um... CORRINE: There's a few different as to what the casque but most recent studies regulate HARMONY: Wow. CORRINE: It is So, it's not hard and bony It's quite soft and spongy And the outside layer is made out of the protein that is found HARMONY: That's pretty... CORRINE: If you push your There's a lot of things a lot of competencies, We will still train with Harmony before she's qualified and we will watch her to make sure she's following And as you can see, she's done, <i> NARRATOR: And the next part <i> that Harmony has to learn CORRINE: It's part Um, you can't get around it. So, if you, you gotta have <i> NARRATOR: Taronga Zoo <i> in recreating environments</i> <i> that animals would inhabit <i> ...whether it's on land,</i> <i> in the water,</i> <i> or a bit of both.</i> GRACE: Hi, Mana. Hi, handsome. <i> NARRATOR: Six common hippos</i> <i> call Western Plains Zoo GRACE: Mana. Open. Hold. Hold. Good, good boy. <i> NARRATOR: But when it comes to <i> that you can't judge GRACE: Hippos are a fantastic My favorite thing about working A lot of people think and they are, but they're in their personality as well. This is Mana. He's our breeding bull He's 23 years old. He's our biggest hippo Hippos in general are quite in particular, their speed. They can actually run and they can swim very fast But the most impressive thing is actually their jaw, These guys can open their mouth, um, almost straight Good. Excellent. Good boy. They actually have a bite down so that's like having a small if you were in a hippo's mouth, which I hope Um, and so they've been known uh, bite crocodiles in half Good. Good boy. Excellent. <i> NARRATOR: As the only bull <i> Mana has already <i> and breeding female Cuddles <i> And keepers are counting down CAROLENE: We're not sure a little boy or a little girl, but I really hope because it will be born in our region And that's going to play in the hippo breeding program <i> NARRATOR: And it seems <i> have to wait too long <i> Back in Sydney, lemur keepers <i> on the back <i> It's concerning because KIMBERLY: When the keeper I was really worried that LIZ: 28 for respiration. <i> NARRATOR: Vet Kimberly <i> a thorough examination <i> under general anesthetic.</i> LIZ: Do you want the light on? KIMBERLY: Sure. Trying to find the incision the prior melanoma because it would be good But the fact is a good indication that The fur is so thick and dense. But if it had a little tumor, Do you want to have a look? Do you want to have a look REBECCA: I cannot find it. KIMBERLY: Yeah, Today I could not where I removed so that's great news because that tumor could have That's a good sign. REBECCA: There is nothing KIMBERLY: Yeah, okay. <i> NARRATOR: So, while the outside <i> Kimberly wants to make sure</i> <i> the cancer hasn't LIZ: There we go. It's fine. KIMBERLY: Okay. <i> NARRATOR: X-rays will give KIMBERLY: Oh, Often you don't get So, I'm checking the lungs cancers and melanoma can spread like liver, uh, So, if I was worried to his lungs or his liver, in the liver area some masses, And then in the lungs, you can see little white spots I don't see that at all. The lungs look pretty clear, That's a good sign. LIZ: Done for x-rays? KIMBERLY: Done. LIZ: Okay. 1, 2, 3. <i> NARRATOR: Now that <i> Andriba's heart <i> she moves on to examine REBECCA: But, um, his new one... KIMBERLY: Show me the new one. REBECCA: ...is around here. KIMBERLY: Let's put him REBECCA: Sternal? KIMBERLY: Yeah, sternal. So, here's a wound here. So, if we can get in there. He might have to have REBECCA: Yep. KIMBERLY: Sorry. REBECCA: He's going KIMBERLY: He might have (laughs) Don't become a, (laughter) LIZ: It's definitely KIMBERLY: Oh, my goodness. <i> NARRATOR: <i> the new wound is obvious.</i> KIMBERLY: This is a new lesion. I can see that it's raised. <i> NARRATOR: And it's got KIMBERLY: It's a bit gooey. CORRINE: Because we always want to make sure HARMONY: Yep. CORRINE: So, you just <i> NARRATOR: Trainee keeper <i> for the world's most dangerous CORRINE: So, here comes Macca. HARMONY: A female. Okay. CORRINE: So, if we want to walk it might encourage them HARMONY: Today I'm lucky enough with our southern cassowary. As they are such there's definitely the nerves but you've got to really focus to make sure that you're properly and correctly everybody else, and the <i> NARRATOR: After watching <i> of the viewing area...</i> CORRINE: Checking. Good. No cassowaries inside. <i> NARRATOR: ...today she will <i> for the first time...</i> CORRINE: All right, Harmony, are safely locked in now. HARMONY: Yep. CORRINE: So we can move on out <i> NARRATOR: ...to learn <i> most important roles CORRINE: So, around 20 different on being ingested They've been referred to as the gardeners and this is because of The cassowaries They're important to the so without the cassowaries and dispersing them a lot of those plants in therefore, we really need So, what we'll be out here is just some of their scats so we want to do a bit of a rake <i> NARRATOR: And just <i> a scat, in this context, CORRINE: Touching scats, Um, you can't get around it, so if you, you've got to have All right, I think we've found HARMONY: Yes. CORRINE: So, this is the perfect example their digestive system works. HARMONY: There's CORRINE: So, there's still So, I think we can see maybe a little bit You've got rock melon skins, and the blue HARMONY: That's the tree that's CORRINE: Yeah, absolutely. You can actually see that their started to break down but it leaves it completely That is ready to germinate. It's sitting in a nice pile of HARMONY: It was so impressive to see how and how gentle it can be and how important they actually CORRINE: So, HARMONY: Oh, wow. CORRINE: ...are actually eggs HARMONY: That's so amazing. CORRINE: So, they're The sheer size of them. HARMONY: Yeah. CORRINE: Um, they come out-- HARMONY: Can I hold one? CORRINE: Of course. CORRINE: They come out If there's lush plants around, you'd be hard pressed But, um, yeah, won't get another chance to see unless you're working HARMONY: This is a beautiful... CORRINE: I'll have to take it You can't have it. HARMONY: Damn, what a shame. (laughs) The training is quite It's not done in one day. um, so every day, CORRINE: So, as we were HARMONY: Some grapes. CORRINE: ...grapes, HARMONY: Kiwi, banana. CORRINE: Yep. Macca and Chuck and down the bottom, sultanas, which is one <i> NARRATOR: And although Harmony HARMONY: to getting fully signed off, <i> NARRATOR: ...training to work <i> has been a real feather HARMONY: I have been I've learned so much. I'm definitely on the right path to start working <i> NARRATOR: And it looks like <i> she'll enjoy nesting HARMONY: I'm so happy here. I found my home, and I want to <i> NARRATOR: Six months ago, <i> to remove a malignant melanoma,</i> <i> and vet Kimberly is concerned KIMBERLY: So, so if we could get in there. So, he's also got now It's raised. It's a bit gooey. <i> NARRATOR: But Kimberly <i> to find out exactly what it is.</i> LIZ: We are going to vacuum, WOMAN: You don't do LIZ: No. KIMBERLY: You can see the skin It's got two punctures there. Do you reckon that looks like REBECCA: Yeah. KIMBERLY: This looks more but that's not saying it's not because tumors can actually Let's measure the distance and see if that looks LIZ: Do you want calipers? KIMBERLY: Yeah. LIZ: Do you want tip to tip? KIMBERLY: Yep, tip to tip. Okay. That's close. and see if that looks like LIZ: Yep. <i> NARRATOR: All evidence <i> to one obvious thing.</i> KIMBERLY: I reckon maybe REBECCA: Yeah, There was tension and there was a few aggressive Where it's located on the back, it seems like a sneak attack, so it's where a lemur um, they, they grab ahold, um, and then they'll jump off. KIMBERLY: But it's very given the distance and the aggression history and the fact that we and that's not come back, so I'm really, So, we'll start him and some antibiotics, but I'm going to take (beeping) So, we're just taking so we can look at the cells, and the biopsy I am pretty sure it's probably but with his history, so we'll look at the cells to see if it's just inflammation If it's melanoma, <i> NARRATOR: Once the site of <i> the team take the opportunity <i> of 21-year-old Andriba.</i> KIMBERLY: I can see which means he can see out. His eyes actually He is an old guy, but his eyes He's got a beautiful very classic He's got these beautiful teeth. On the bottom, that act like a comb, but He's just going to We're not going because he's doing okay. He has got a bit of tartar <i> NARRATOR: <i> Andriba is in surprisingly KIMBERLY: Ketamine could the midazolam may hang out. <i> NARRATOR: And with <i> it's time to wake him up.</i> LIZ: Starting to wake up.

I want him to just have and continue without having to deal <i> NARRATOR: Out at Taronga <i> there's some exciting news CAROLENE: Our beautiful female to a little male calf, which means strength. Cuddles actually gave birth in Uh, that's quite natural in the shallows of the water. This precious little hippo calf, he is the first male calf born so he's going to play an extremely valuable within the future <i> NARRATOR: Today keeper Carolene CAROLENE: Cuddles! Kani! <i> NARRATOR: Checking in on <i> is an important part CAROLENE: Good girl, Cuddles. Kani, are you hiding? (laughs) He's thriving. He's approximately so he's developing really well. As you can see, he's putting on and that's just due to his mum, But her milk so they tend to pack it on <i> NARRATOR: The first few months <i> are hugely important.</i> CAROLENE: During this mum Cuddles likes to keep and protected Little Kani, as he develops, how to behave and this is where Mum especially when he meets Dad when he meets his elder sisters So, everything how he moves in the water, is, um, pretty important Hippos are naturally even though they come out on Hippos have where they are able 'cause they're very, and that stops into their respiratory system. Kani, for the first few days was very clunky. He was trying but now he's starting and he's actually quite or water system now, and he can hold his breath <i> NARRATOR: At the zoo, <i> seasonal adjustments <i> so for Kani and Cuddles,</i> <i> it means today <i> the hippo version CAROLENE: Hippos in winter tend to be out of the water as opposed to what so that means that their skin which forms lots of cracks, and they can be to little bacterial sores so we need to apply what I call Um, it's just a mixture so it's a little bit uh, mixed with water, of course. Hippos need a bit of pampering. I think they're probably um, that I know of. <i> NARRATOR: It's clear that Kani <i> and as one of the only <i> Kani will have a big future <i> But for now, life is <i> Taronga Zoo Wildlife Hospital <i> all sorts of emergencies <i> from animals both inside <i> And today they've received LARRY: Wow. <i> NARRATOR: ...an adult LARRY: Who brought it?

These are the challenges Two centimeters Part of being a zoo vet is you've got to think and adapt whatever your to, to any shape or size WOMAN: How's that? LARRY: Perfect. (beep) So, looking at this turtle, there's certainly no hooks, Uh, we wouldn't be able of plastic or fishing line. We routinely take x-rays that is a big issue obviously, ingesting, uh, Um, but so far there, you know, this was a completely that unfortunately So far, nothing terribly wrong <i> NARRATOR: Happy <i> Larry wants a closer look at WOMAN: 61 centimeters. LARRY: So, I think they're sort of welts in a way, and, um, they're pink, and that's a typical part that we see because they're swimming along Their front part gets caught.

That's it. JO: Good girl. That's it. Little plodder. MICHELLE: In the normal course we would take them before the zoo guests arrive, uh, but at the moment, because of COVID-19, it means that we can do it uh, and we have to sort of have some fun JO: Gari came to us She was brought in and you can see when she walks, And you can see her foot here.

LARRY: Oh, we don't know, but so but she could be SARAH: So, we're just of the Heads at Sydney Harbor. The reason why we go is because it just gives them not to come back stay away from the boats and and just to be in deeper water. It's so great that we can For her to be going and hopefully to be able and better the species <i> NARRATOR: With the boat <i> it's time to let this turtle LARRY: So, I think we'll just get and then just unwrap her there.

LARRY: And slip her off. Whoa. Not very elegant, but anyway. SARAH: Straight under the boat. Soon as we took yeah, she just kind of, get the smell, and then, They know what they're doing, LARRY: You know, over time, and, uh, you know, ultimately hopefully she'll, you know, that she usually turns up on, and, and lays a good clutch and many more to come.
