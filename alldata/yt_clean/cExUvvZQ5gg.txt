It's better not to let others misunderstand Your relationship is good. Sheng Yize. You're too much of a bully. The Sheng family is unrivaled in the Haicheng business district. The Sheng family is unrivaled in the Haicheng business circle. The Sheng family. He's the only heir. Everyone's trying to suck up to him. That's why he, Sheng Yize. That's why he has no fear. What do you mean? What do you mean? There's a second heir to the Sheng family? Sheng family? There are illegitimate children in the Sheng family. That's not what I meant. Soon. The Sheng family will have A second heir. Sheng Yize. Will he be able to inherit the Sheng family? Is still unknown. Really? If you want to completely Sheng Yize's morale. We have to start with the company he started. A I Company. As long as we work together. You're right. Sheng Yize. Thank you, Mr. Sheng. For what? For thinking that I'm targeting Zhang Qi.

I know. I don't hate you. I hate myself more. Why should I hate you? But I can't help it, The one Want to be close to you, J he one J he one Every time I lose control H he one It's all because Don't be like this. You can't just kiss anyone. It makes you look cheap. You're the one who told your roommate We don't know each other well Obviously, I'm the one who's passive. That's because I'm afraid of being self-righteous. If you're not afraid Then go public. I'm not afraid. Aren't you afraid that I'm I'm using you to get back at your mom. If your mom and Sheng Kuo Wa knows that we are in love. She will never be able to She'll never be able to marry into the Sheng family. Coward. I'm not a coward. Then let's make it public. That day. Zhou Xizi told me. Even if we really are together. It won't last more than a month She's crazy. She's so unsure of herself. Then you should try harder Try to make me like you more. I've already tried very hard I'm trying to make you like me more Sang-yu. Didn't you say You're Sheng Yize's sister? Can you help me? I like Sheng Yize. How can you be like this? I'm sorry. I can't. I can't. Why can't you? He's not your boyfriend. He's my boyfriend. Sheng Yize. Something's wrong with you lately. This Sang-tso. When did she become Your girlfriend? None of your business. No wonder. You hate her mom so much. But you're still so devoted to her. I won't even let her touch me. So it's because I like her. Cut! I'm his boyfriend. But you said he's your brother. Then why didn't you tell me before? You wanted me to? It's okay. I've already told you. Tell her not to pry into other people's privacy. What you said is true. It's true. Sang-yu's mom Sang Yun-man was never married She got pregnant before she got married She had Sang-yu In the past few years Sang Yun Man has always been She worked hard to bring up Sang-yu When Sang was 8 years old He followed her to Haicheng It was Sheng Guohua who gave her money He secretly gave her money. That means It's possible that Sang Yeo Is the illegitimate daughter of Sang Yun Man Sheng Guohua's illegitimate daughter? I think so too. Otherwise, Sang Yun Man Why would she be a mistress? That would be much more interesting. If Sheng Yize knew Sang Ye Zee is His blood sister At least they can't be together They can't be together for the rest of their lives. Lovers become brother and sister. What lovers? Sheng Yize treated her It's just a whim. Xichongsheng's property management. I just heard it in the cafeteria. Sang-yu and Sheng Yize have made an official announcement. Telling people they're in love. That bitch! Wait for me! Xizi, tell me. If they're really siblings. Sang-yu's mom If Sang Wan Man finds out Xi Fei Chen's property Then who's going to tell her? You and Sang Yeo When did you get together? I should be celebrating her. But when I see her with someone else. I get so jealous. I'm afraid if I'm a little late. I'd lose her to someone else. Sheng Yize, you're finished. I knew I was doomed. He's the only son of the richest Sheng family. Yes, that's him. Don't bully him! Someone's coming! There's a human trafficker here! Sheng Yize! Let's go to the hospital. Zou Jin! Send someone to the police station. Investigate clearly. Is everything okay? It's fine. Get an anti-inflammatory injection. You'll be fine after the fever goes down and you get some sleep. Can you stop burning? I'll do it for you. Hey! Sang-tu! What am I supposed to do with you? Why are you pinching me? I guess I didn't burn myself silly last night. Look if you want to I'm your boyfriend now Did you stay here all night yesterday? Yes, I did. That's tiring, isn't it? What do you think? I'm sorry for the trouble. Go home and get some rest. Last night was so dangerous. Aren't you afraid of dying? I didn't think about it at the time. Sang-yu. Promise me. Don't do anything dangerous again. I admit I'm finished. Even though I know She's Sang Yun Man's daughter I can't let her go. Zoe, you can only be mine. I'm going out for a while. I'll be right back You scared me to death yesterday. That man had a knife. I didn't have time to think. I'm glad you're okay. Otherwise, Sheng Yize I'd be worried sick. What? You don't know. When he carried you here. You fainted from the pain. He kept sweeping. When he begged the doctor to save you. He even cried. Was he scared? Did you find out who it was? No, he didn't. He just said You took something that belonged to him. That's a lot of talk. Looks like we're being watched. Who could it be? In Jiangcheng. There's still someone who dares to mess with you The bastard son of the Jiang family. Ze. I heard you were injured. I came here to take a look. Can you? Ze. Auntie wants to ask you something. What is it? I'm going to school. I'm going to ask for a vacation for Tzu-Tzu. I ran into her roommate.

I don't approve of your relationship. You have to break up. Why? Anyway. You must not fall in love. Let's pretend this never happened. You didn't let her To get close to me So that she could marry into the Sheng family. Why? Now you think she's influencing you To marry into my family. That's not true, Ze. You can't be together. I'm begging you, Auntie. I just wanted I just wanted you to be taken care of. I didn't realize. I can't do that. Ozawa. It's not right. It's not right. What about when you were with my father? When you were with my dad and killed my mom. Did you think It was wrong. Your mom's death Was really just an accident I had nothing to do with it. Ozawa. The police investigated it. It was an accident. Why don't you believe me? What about your affair with my father? Is it true? You dare to say that you two Don't you dare say that you two didn't have an illicit relationship? It makes me sick. Don't ever see me again. Mom! I asked you to take care of Ozawa. That's how you took care of him. How old are you? Don't you have any more shame? You're the one who did it. Auntie, Sang-tae's hurt. Why did you hit her? Break up with Ozawa. Break up with Ozawa. Or else. Don't blame me for being cruel. I don't recognize you as my daughter. I won't break up with you. Lok Lok. Go back to school first Yes, I'm fine I'll see you later You're all grown up now! You've grown up, haven't you? Sheng Yize wants to eat me alive. He'd like to eat me alive.

Are you really a mistress? You broke up someone else's family. And killed Sheng Yize's mom. Right? His mom is the mistress. What do you mean? It's nothing. Anyway. You should never be with Sheng Yize. He doesn't really care about you. He's just a toy. And what happened between you two. You mustn't let Uncle Sheng know. Uncle Sheng know about it. If he finds out. What would he think? Mother and daughter. He'll kick us out of the Sheng family. I like Sheng Yize. I've liked him for a long, long time. I've always liked him. I've liked him for a long time. So I won't I won't break up. Zoe. Why have you become so selfish? What about mom? Have you ever considered Mom's feelings? If I marry your Uncle Sheng. Then you two will be brother and sister. You'll never work out. Mom. I've always been obedient. I've always listened to you. But this time I want to make my own decisions. Sang-tae, I'm telling you. You can't make this decision. You must separate from Sheng Yize. Otherwise. Don't blame mom for being cruel. She hit you again. She wants us to break up. Why? She's afraid I'll hurt you. I'm not good to you. Or is she afraid that this matter To my father. It'll affect her ability to marry into the Sheng family. I think it's both Here. They're all your favorites. Fried chestnuts. Phoenix claws and lots of fruit Zou Jin How do you know I love these things. Sheng Yize said so. I've loved you for so many years. How could I not know? What you like to eat. Thank you, Mr. Sheng.

You're quick on the uptake. You've got a lot of nerve, Xie Jingyu. I'm going back to the Jiang family. Your uncle has conditions. He wants me to. I had to take this project. But you took it from him. That's because you're incompetent. Do you really think Jiyang Technology chose you Because you're more capable than me? It's because they're afraid of the Sheng family. It's to give your father face. Xie Jingyu, I'm warning you once more. From now on If you ever touch Sheng's hair again. I won't mind sending you to hell Ha ha ha! Sheng Yize, you're in deep shit. You've got a soft spot.

Xie Jingyu had someone do it. How can that be? Do you believe me or him? Yes, but He's the bastard son of the Jiang family He's my uncle's son Such a complicated relationship And as far as I know You can't be Sheng Guo Hua's illegitimate daughter. If you are his daughter.

You wouldn't have put it off until now. I think You're just concerned about the Sheng family's reputation. You think my mom Married into the Sheng family Married to the Sheng family. Would bring shame to the Sheng family. And me. I'm not good enough for Sheng Yize. You think Sheng Yize Deserves someone better. You're a smart girl. The Sheng family We do need a good match. That's why. So you have no intention To marry my mother You're just trying to trick her. Right? I'm talking about you and Ozawa. Between you and Ze. Uncle Sheng. What's between me and Ezawa. I won't bother you with that. If he thinks I'm not good enough for him. Or if one day he thinks We're not suitable anymore. I'll leave on my own accord. I won't get involved. Uncle Sheng. You should trust your own son. If he's not good enough for you. He won't stay together for long. And won't really be attracted to him. You're overconfident. You think Ozawa is attracted to you. Is it because you're good? No, it's not. Uncle Sheng. I'm just using your mind. To comfort you. You think I'm not good enough for him. Then we won't We won't be together for long. Not even There's no need for you to intervene. I'm really not worried that my son Will be interested in you for too long. But the honor of the Sheng family Can't be tarnished in any way. When you gave my mother When you give my mother a chance. The honor of the sheng family Was already tarnished. You never reflected on yourself. You never reflected on yourself. But you started with your juniors. That's what I'm talking about. Only the officials are allowed to set fire You don't allow the people to light the lamps. Sang-soo. Uncle Sheng. I'm not like my mom. I haven't spent a penny of your money. I used a student loan for school. I'll pay it back when I graduate. I paid for my living expenses myself. I've been working hard to pay for my living expenses. I've never received any favors from you. So You have no right to threaten me. That's true. You're really different from your mom. Maybe. I am like my father. Although I don't know who he is. Mom. I want you to be happy. But I also want you to see clearly. No matter how hard you try. There's no way to wake up The person who pretends to be asleep Look at the good daughter you raised Now she dares to challenge me So this is what you mean by nurturing her well. She'll marry into the Sheng family in the future. To work for the Sheng family. Let's go back to school. What did he offer you? How much did he pay you to leave me? He doesn't believe you're true to me. He doesn't believe you're true to me. He just thinks Our little fight. It's affecting the Sheng family's reputation. I knew it. Everyone thinks We won't last. Do you think so, too? At least. For now. But what happens in the future? Who knows? Maybe someday. I'll be good enough And you won't be good enough for me. You want to be good now. And dump me. I've always thought &quot;The mountains are falling down. The people who depend on you will fall apart. Only if you become hard enough That's the only one who belongs to you. It won't be taken away from you. So, Sheng Yize. If you're true to me. Then please wait for me. I'll try my best to catch up with you. If You're only interested in me on a whim Then please wait for me Before you lose interest in me Please tell me You're good enough for everyone A coward. It's always been me. I asked Uncle Sheng.

Nor do I want you to be My brother. Mr. Sang-tso. When did you start When did you start to love my beauty? The first time I saw you Guohua. Why are you so angry? Did something happen to you? It's not that Fu Chul-ming. He's been against me all these years. Calm down first. The Fu family. The top family in the business world. The Fu Group. In Hong Kong, it's no less than the Sheng family If you two continue to be at loggerheads. It's no good. That's enough. Stop pressing the button. You're good at cooking and washing. What else can you do? You can't help me at all. If Feng Ling were here. She could help me with my social life. Yun Man Sit down first I didn't mean it like that.

The news has already been released. Sheng's family hasn't reacted at all. What's the hurry? A man like Sheng Kuo Hua. He cares most about his reputation. The campus forum is just a little bit hot. Has been suppressed by Sheng Yize It's been suppressed. It can't threaten the Sheng family at all. The only way is to get to the root of the problem. The only way to get Sheng Guohua to take action Then we can get Sheng Guo Hua to take action. What do you mean? He, Sheng Yize. Didn't he always think that Sheng Yunman His mom's death? Then let's do what he wants. Let the media publicize it. Sheng Guohua for the sake of his mistress. For the sake of his mistress. Sheng Yunman's evil mistress rose to power. Sang's illegitimate daughter She has no sense of shame Seduced her own brother If things get out of hand. It will affect the Shengshi Group And Yize's company. Yize has just started his own business. Do you even care about that now? I just want He breaks up with Sang-yu, that's all. Zhou Xizi. If Sheng Kuo-wah doesn't make a move.

Don't talk to her. She's a princess. The last time the forum falsely accused The last time she framed someone on the forum. She hasn't learned her lesson yet. I heard that she was written up by the school. I guess she's got a grudge. She deserved it. I put my bracelet under Sang-tae's pillow. I put it under Sang-tae's pillow. Sang-tae. You got me a demerit. And my dad beat me up. Wait for me! Sang-tae! I'm sorry. I was wrong about what happened last time. I want to apologize to you. Can we still be friends?

You've gone too far. I know you need money. You've been picking up garbage for others. And you work as an escort. (Wow, really) I can give it to you. Sang-tae. Don't be too hard on them. After all. We're all in the same dormitory. We don't see each other. Besides, he's so sincere Slander and rumor It's a crime. She'll only get a demerit. Not expelled. I'm being kind. We're not all saints. Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Sang-tu. Let's see how you're going to act when you get back to the dormitory. How can you be so cocky? Where's my bracelet? My bracelet is gone Have you seen my bracelet? My father bought it for me It's over 300,000 dollars. I'm not going to be able to stand up to these rich people. We can't stand each other.

My dad bought it for me. Sang-tae must have stolen it. I heard that Sang-tu is short of money. Today in class. Lee Eun made a pass at her She didn't agree. I think so too She doesn't even have a father. She relies on student loans to pay for school. She must have a motive. What's going on? Auntie. My bracelet was stolen. Sang-tae must have stolen it. Search her stuff and you'll find out. Okay, Lee Eun. You're waiting for us here. It wasn't enough for you last time. Now you're doing it again. I'm begging you. Give me back my bracelet. Mr. Sang-tae. Cooperate with the inspection. We need to search Your things. What if we can't? Think of it as a favor to your classmate. If we don't find anything, it'll put her mind at ease. If you really took it. Give it back to your classmate as soon as possible. If you want to search, fine. But if you can't. You, Lee Eun You'll have to move out of the dormitory. And you. You'll apologize to me. Okay. If you're not here. I'll move out of the dorm. But if it's here. I'll call the police. That's not true. How can it not be here? You never change. Come up here and look under the pillow. Look under the pillow. Where did you hide my bracelet? Where did you hide it? It was on the table, wasn't it? It's so obvious. It's right there. Can't you see it? No way. Why is it here? If you're going to frame someone. Please use a little bit more Be smart about it. Lee Eun said I'm poor in front of everyone today. In front of everyone, he said I'm poor. I need money. General Studies [One] I don't think this is right Is she holding something back? I also think this Lee Eun I don't think she's up to no good.
