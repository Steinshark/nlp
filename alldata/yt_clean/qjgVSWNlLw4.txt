(upbeat music) - [Narrator] Line up the top and this is how it looks today. But JetBlue's $3.8 billion last month would change this picture. The tie-up would see moving JetBlue one rung - You know, the word they've and that's probably right that, you know, if they're able to get this deal done, it really puts them in a different class really quickly. - [Narrator] But the so-called Big Four, American, United, Delta and Southwest, would maintain their places. - If you look at what this is it's really an acquisition about assets. It's about JetBlue acquiring and for the crew members, who - [Narrator] The question is can a bigger JetBlue compete and how? Let's take a look at a few key metrics to see where the company stands now, where it will be if the deal goes through, and if there could be a Big Five? First, pilots. Anyone who's been to an airport recently knows that travel is rough right now. One of the challenges to grapple with this summer, there aren't enough pilots. Globally, demand for pilots is projected to exceed supply by 2024. But in North America, it's already here and airlines are scrambling to both hire and retain employees. - You've seen carriers Allegiant, JetBlue lose to United, American, Delta, Southwest. And so this is really a way acquire a cadre of pilots - [Narrator] By adding from having around 3,800 That's still about half of Delta's industry-leading 13,180 pilots. - Having more pilots it just And so when they go into a new market, they can offer multiple flights a day instead of maybe just one, or they can go into more new markets, where they're not already present. And you know that just more meaningful competitor. - [Narrator] JetBlue would also benefit from the type of pilots the deal brings. JetBlue and Spirit, both - To have pilots who and qualified to fly an Airbus A320 or an A321 simplifies things and really reduces cost for a JetBlue. - [Narrator] Next up fleet. Without its deal for Spirit, in its fleet putting it - Getting planes it's just There's delays in deliveries, So just the idea of just quickly acquiring a couple hundred planes was - So acquiring Spirit's all Airbus fleet would give JetBlue a total with some 300 more on order. - That would take it many years, I think they've said eight to that size that they So they kind of looked around and deciding really the best way to that can even begin to compete is through an acquisition. - [Narrator] These planes Spirit's yellow will be painted over and JetBlue has said Spirit's packed planes with JetBlue's roomier model, but even taking seats away, this deal would bring JetBlue So let's talk about seats. To see how the airline stacks up, it's best to look at a metric This metric is calculated by multiplying the number of seats by the number of miles - The more ASMs you have, So it's a great metric to show the size from a capacity standpoint of an airline. - [Narrator] In 2021, available seat miles. Combining with Spirit's 40 billion would edge the airline closer then sixth place, Alaska. But even with Spirit, JetBlue's slice of overall seat capacity will sit at 8%. Analysts say to grow that, JetBlue will need to expand its reach. - I think what really to get its share closer United, Delta, and America is to set up some sort of a focus in the middle of the country. - [Narrator] And lastly destinations. Currently, JetBlue flies Spirit flies to 90. The combined airline That number is more like - Often in airline mergers regulators say, well, We need you to cut or need you to divest so there's not so much overlap. If the deal is allowed to go forward there will likely be - 127 destinations would move which currently flies to 121 locations. The other three would all have more than double JetBlue's destinations. (plane whooshing) The deal would make Fort Lauderdale JetBlue's busiest airport The combined airline would then surpass Southwest and Delta to become carrier by seats after American. - Florida has been, especially just one of the busiest It is important to airlines to have a meaningful presence there and growing there can be - [Narrator] JetBlue says like Ford Lauderdale, would However, JetBlue would be out of the equation. And some argue that less raising prices for all. Proving that competition after the deal will be key to getting regulators to bless the merger. - JetBlue has argued that the government has of four really big airlines by allowing all of these mergers. And that the only way to is to allow another and get big enough to challenge - [Narrator] Spirit and had previously argued that regulators would almost between Spirit and JetBlue and that the review for up to two years. JetBlue has said that any deal, including the failed combination between Spirit and Frontier of pushback from regulators. JetBlue expects the and be finalized by the first half of 2024 followed by a four to five And analysts say an even longer time before it might truly - It won't be five years from now. Won't be 10 years from does is create a combined with those Big Four and really makes the future JetBlue relevant in the industry. (gentle music)
