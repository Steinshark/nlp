It's harder than expected to find... immortal truck drivers here, huh? I found one! How do you feel when you have to cross such narrow roads? Absolutely terrified! This time we weren't lucky. We have to climb up back there... to hitch a ride. Now I totally understand what it means to be loaded onto a cattle wagon. When I travel on dangerous roads with the mountain on one side and a sheer drop on the other, it's a game of life and death. My name is Giuseppe, and I have a mission: to travel the world meeting the most extraordinary people on the planet and ask them one simple question: What does happiness mean to you? Welcome to &quot;PROJECT HAPPINESS.&quot; This time it's going to be really hard to convince you that this is Pakistan's largest beauty center. Here, Pakistani trucks are decorated and transformed into incredibly unique vehicles, often dubbed the most beautiful trucks in the world. In these workshops work the finest craftsmen in the country, who with meticulous precision transform the body of these trucks, making them unique. It can take up to three months of work to go from this... to this. They say that in Pakistan, it's impossible to find two trucks alike. And it's believable because each of the over 200,000 registered trucks that cross mountains, deserts, and cities, aren't just simple vehicles; they're moving works of art, a real expressive language for the drivers, a way to show their identity and pride. Hearts, flowers, animals, Bollywood stars, folk singers, politicians, angels, and prayers. And often these decorations include elements that remind the truck drivers of their home, their family, so they don't feel lonely during the long and dangerous journeys. All these stories and emotions are told through the decorations of master craftsmen, who for a century now have passed this art down from generation to generation. I learned this craft back in 1987. From the finest artisans in the country. Just like a person our trucks want to go around well-groomed. It's like we're giving them a bit of perfume to make them stand out when they pass. We sew a suit on them to make them elegant and beautiful. When our works of art travel across the country, we bring honor and glory to our homeland, Pakistan. I think you can feel how much we love our work. For example, now we're working on an old truck that will become wonderful. The owner trusts us. He just told us he wants it to be unique. Everyone wants their truck to be the most beautiful. It's like a competition between them. But Pakistan's roads are among the most dangerous in the world, and the good luck decorations are often not enough to keep the drivers safe. In fact, Pakistani truck drivers risk their lives every day to deliver their loads, and that's why they're known and celebrated as the immortals here. The goal of this mission is to hitchhike to get onto one of these trucks and accompany one or more immortal drivers along their journey on one of the most dangerous roads on the planet. Okay, the real adventure starts here. Because we're at a crucial crossroad for immortal truck drivers who stop here, apparently to drink their favorite drink, which is the truckers' energy drink: sugarcane juice. They say it's the best here, I don't understand how, because it's just one ingredient. But now we'll try it and ask the sellers at these stalls how we can approach these truck drivers and get on their trucks. Let's go. By the way, we shouldn't use the ice because it might cause stomach problems. But I want the full experience. Here it is, let's try it. It's delicious. They even add a touch of lime, and it's a powerful sugar concentrate that helps keep truck drivers alert during their long hauls. Often loaded to the point of bursting, these trucks make their way through small villages, up and down rugged mountain roads, and across deserts, carrying tons of goods ranging from gravel, cement, and iron to wheat, cotton, and fruit. Most of them are majestic old Bedford trucks, no longer in production, of course, but here they defy time, remaining faithful allies to the immortal truck drivers. It's harder than expected to find... the immortal truck drivers here, huh? We found one, after two hours we did it, he stopped here. and he said he's going to Chitral. Let's go... Look at the details, beautiful, made of wood. It's so small, wow, what excitement. There might be some communication problems, but we'll try to manage. Ah, he took the camera, "you keep it." Okay, nice, thank you. We can go? Oh, and there's also... there's a fan, hahaha... there's a fan. He can't even change gears because... here we go. How long have you been driving trucks? It's already been 13 years. Do you see your truck as a good friend in some way? Is it your work partner? This truck is literally my heart. How do you feel when you have to drive on narrow, very dangerous roads? Terribly scared! I'm always afraid. I'm even afraid of this busy road. But I have a mission to complete. And even though I'm scared, I do it anyway. The windshield is very small and narrow, how do you manage to see well? Sometimes I can't see anything and have to rely on memory or intuition. Sometimes I even close my eyes. And even though I have mirrors everywhere, it's often my sixth sense that guides me. Would you ever sell it for any amount of money? Would you ever sell it to someone? No, no! I wouldn't sell it for anything in the world! How could I sell my heart? There are so many of us here. There's another one over there... Ali has practically become a sardine. Another brother of Nayyat... another brother of Nayyat... We're five, and... There should be at most three people here. Brother, your brother... Brother. Uh, maybe it's better if... My new friend tells me a really moving story. In recent years, the art of Pakistani trucks has been used to help find missing children. They painted their portraits on the trucks, with all the contact information, and so each truck became a true messenger of hope on the roads of Pakistan. A truly touching story that makes the history of these trucks even more fascinating. Let's take a look; I'm really curious to peek inside here. He has papers, but look how beautiful these... these compartments are. This is the plaque. There's some junk but... Can I try? The kids asked him to honk... the horn... and I helped him. Tobacco? Yes. All truckers put some... tobacco paste in their mouth. Like this... and then... here. Here. It's a tobacco paste, they put it here and slowly it releases nicotine. Here? Yes. Well, it's... obviously addictive like cigarettes. But here in Pakistan, truck drivers use it... to relax. I think we'll have to get off soon because there's no room for his brothers he works with. But we need to ask him one last question. Nayyat, I have a question for you: what makes you truly happy? This truck is my happiness! It's like a friend that keeps me company. And I'm proud of it because it's my vehicle. I bought it with my life savings. And every time I get in, I smile, remembering it. I had only ever read about these trucks. I had studied their history, their culture, but I had never ridden in one. And it's really an emotion being here because you see the world and the road from a different perspective... from above. And especially from a work of art, this is truly one of the most beautiful I've ever seen. Furnished down to the smallest details as they used to be. But I think we'll have to get off soon. He hinted at it very politely, very kindly, but... his brothers can't fit inside, the younger brother is squashed there, while he's half outside, so in a little while, Ali and I will have to get off, and rightfully so. Well, our journey with him ends here. Because otherwise, his brothers won't be able to fit inside the truck, poor guys, so we say goodbye to him, and now we need to find another one. So, can I stay behind? This time we weren't lucky. The truck driver isn't alone, he's with all his colleagues, so I have to climb in the back to, to hitch a ride. Could it have gone worse? There could have been, wow!, oxen... But now the goal is to not fall off the truck. I don't need to tell you that we're flying here. We certainly don't go unnoticed on the back of a truck in a remote village in the mountains of Pakistan. People might be wondering, like... what are they doing? A short journey, but definitely intense. Okay, bye. And now we need to find another one, because they're continuing on. What an adventure, guys, what an adventure! I'm becoming an expert on trucks now. This one is much newer than the others, it even has a rearview camera. And he's taking us a bit further north. He already explained that he can only take us a few dozen kilometers, because for example, he's afraid of the checkpoints. He's afraid the police will stop us and give him trouble, so he doesn't want to take any risks, but he was kind enough to take us a bit further. Now we're trying to talk, even though there will be big communication and language barriers, but we'll try. It's been almost six or seven years. I've been driving for six, seven years now, but I just bought this vehicle to transport stones from one part of the country to another. Driving makes me feel alive. Especially when it's dangerous. For me, it becomes a mission to deliver the load to its destination. But these are the roads of Pakistan. Not everyone is capable of driving in these conditions. Only the best truck drivers can master them. Maybe only the craziest have the courage to drive here. What's the secret to being a good truck driver? You have to consider that these are very heavy trucks, and on these mountains, every small mistake can be fatal. But I love that thrill. That's why I love my job. Our new friend asked me for a few minutes' pause because it seems he got lost. But I'll take advantage of this to tell you something very important. Yes, because below the video I've left you a link to try out NORDVPN's new "ULTIMATE" plan, it's not just a VPN, but a true digital shield that includes: NORDVPN, which lets you browse safely and quickly from anywhere in the world; NORDPASS, to create, protect, and manage all your passwords; "Threat Protection Pro" to block ads, dangerous sites, and protect you from phishing; and then "NordLocker," an encrypted cloud space to protect your most important files. I always keep it on because it blocks ads, warns me if I'm entering dangerous sites, and when my email ended up on the dark web, it protected me by immediately notifying me so I could take action right away. Plus, with just one subscription, I can protect up to ten devices, so my whole family can feel safe. And as always, even in the most remote part of Pakistan, I've left you a link in the description to try NORDVPN and finally browse in total safety. Now let's get back to driving with our friend. We stopped for a moment because on the side of the road there are some colleagues who had a mechanical problem, so they're fixing it. When you see a colleague in trouble, you must always help him. The guys are explaining to me that these are the typical risks you face when driving one of the toughest and most treacherous roads in the world, in fact, due to the heavy weight of the loads they have to transport, mechanical parts can break or fail, so this can... can happen. But now they're stuck here, and another trucker is coming from Peshawar, a city 10 hours away from here, to help them. So now all we can do is support them like this. In the meantime, I take the opportunity to chat with one of them, who tells me his story. My uncle was an immortal truck driver. He had one of the most colorful trucks in the country. I was still a child, but once I finished school, I had no doubt, I wanted to be like him. I followed him everywhere to convince him it wasn't just a whim. I was determined. And I remember he said: "Alright, if this is truly what you want, I'll teach you, but don't die." When you drive on roads like these, you need to be an experienced truck driver, otherwise you won't make it home. If you're not perfect in every maneuver, then you can't drive on these mountains. Better stay in the city. But we who take the risks, get to see breathtaking views from our windows. We meet amazing people in the villages. For us, this is not just a job, it's a great journey where you only know the starting point and the destination, everything else is a big adventure. Incredible, he's showing me his most difficult load. There were two... two huge blocks of marble that he transported from one city to another, and he said it was really complex to transport them because the truck was completely unbalanced, he couldn't control it and was really scared. These are the risks that an... an immortal trucker can face. And even the journey with Hamza ends here, but before we say goodbye, we share a good &quot;chai&quot; at a kind of rest stop where, according to him, I'll have a better chance of finding someone to give me a lift. We're helping this trucker in exchange for a ride. Up north. We are heading to Chitral to load some cement. Actually, we don't know exactly what we'll find there. It could be that we'll load steel. It's a hard life, but we like it this way. You're certainly never bored. And thank God it allows us to earn a living for our children. It's more than a job because it blends with our life. We are Muslims. Traveling across our great country, Pakistan, makes us extremely proud. Praise be to God. Our truck is like a country house for us, big, solid, and welcoming. In this vehicle resides our destiny. It's all a matter of fate. Because our job is very risky, few people know how to drive like I do. It requires courage and madness. I fear only Allah, He will decide when my time comes. I could fall into the river down here, off a mountain cliff, or have a heart attack while driving. It's all in His hands. How do you deal with fear when traveling on such difficult roads? When I travel in such dangerous areas, with the mountain on one side and the cliff on the other, it's a game of life and death. This will be my last stop, but before getting their truck back on the road, they share their concept of happiness with me. He taught me to be happy. He's my teacher, but I consider him like a father now. He's teaching me techniques and tricks to become, God willing, a great truck driver. But I'm already happy because, thanks to this job, I earn honestly and can help others. I can send money to my parents to make them happy and proud of their son. Just as you are showing passion and courage in your work, it's the same for me driving my truck. It's the source of my happiness because thanks to it, I feed my children. Our bread, clothes, and home, it's all thanks to it. I love it for this, and I'm grateful for it. Allah sent this truck as a means of halal sustenance, and I thank Him every day for this gift. Every journey has the power to transform us, and this adventure along Pakistan's most dangerous roads was no exception. It was an honor to share the road with the immortal truck drivers, who are the beating heart of a country that moves, grows, and evolves. Their work, often invisible, is the engine that keeps the commerce and transport of an entire nation running. Far from the spotlight, they face treacherous roads every day, extreme conditions, and unimaginable challenges. But they do it with a dignity and strength of spirit that I won't forget. And of course, I won't forget their wonderful trucks, faithful companions and shelters during long nights away from home. Every little decoration that adorns their vehicles tells their story, representing a part of their life and identity, welcoming me into their world with simplicity and generosity, they showed me how their work is a metaphor for life. Every step of our journey, every dangerous curve we face, defines and enriches us. And we must never forget to value the journey itself. The importance of living it with courage and passion, just like them.
