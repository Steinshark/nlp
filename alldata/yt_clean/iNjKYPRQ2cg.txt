I would call this the largest scale we've ever seen in this game. He was forced to confess, it was not It changed an entire two years top player history. I know how much money It wasn't a small amount. All of us have that one game that we share either because it helped us get through a rough time in our life, or it allowed us to meet others, and form long term friendships. In my case, that game is Geometry Dash, a silly little mobile game have had on your phone But do not let that undersell you, that has occurred over Because it turns out, There's millions of other players just as much as I do, and when a community it is only natural OH MY GOD HI HI HI HI WHAT, I just beat XO [...] It is hard to put into words these players have, from executing almost pixel to pushing the limits of what Tonnes of friendly rivalries with top players helping each other out and cheering It was all about pushing However, the story that I'm going When one of those players decides that everyone else is worth... JACK. SHIT. [Dramatic Effect] Welcome to Geometry Dash. Originally starting as a mobile game, it was eventually released The gameplay is actually very similar to the old classic &quot;The Impossible Game&quot;, way more layers added An editor. This means anyone can go and upload them to the servers This feature alone is this game over the years. The developer himself clearly has shown no signs of maintaining the game on an active basis, to create levels and content OH MY GOD they do it well. This game is truly blessed, and creative communities out there, A badge that we should wear But it's not just on the creative side where players have pushed over the years. Just like in any game, One of the most prestigious titles is to be the verifier of the current hardest level. The community has to create a list that ranks on their difficulty. With the Level that sits being the current hardest level that anyone has EVER beaten. An absolute horrid and treacherous task that has taken a toll in the game. Beating a top one demon is not something it's a journey that can take HUNDREADS of thousands of but at the end you stand as a true symbol of determination and skill with everyone's attention on you. So what would happen their way to the top? [AeonAir] There's a lot of people say which I personally kind of believe. On one end, It's just kind of like But because the game is the number one player is kind what you should reach after. Kind of like a swimmer trying [Samifying] Yeah... The history of the number one player Over the years a countless have actually shared that title. Whoever was considered the best player was actively beating the hardest levels, and pushing the boundaries This title however would always For a majority of this game's lifespan, it actually always was a group of players that was hanging around at the top. You would have constant rivalries just pushing each other further and further and while they were having DragonBallZ(tm) fight up there, the rest of the community from an outsiders point of view. This was absolutely amazing to watch. Sitting around in streams all day, watching them throw attempt *seemed* to be It's like rooting for your You want them to succeed, you want them to beat that level because you know how much work and effort There's a certain level of trust that the community has between them Trust that... Sadly, has been abused As I explained in my Impossible one of the biggest rivalries was between Riot And if you watched that video, It turned out Cyclic Apparently not a single one that we all knew him for, that we all loved him for, was legit. :( This is something that struck A dagger Up until that point, It wasn't really precedented that, a community figure, that we all looked up to, would abuse our trusts, in such a blatant way. and you would think that from that people When you cheat, Sure! and people think you're actually but long term... you're but an entire community hard working players. And the person I'm going for some reason, just didn't get that. &gt;:( [TrickGMD] He... he was hard to comprehend He was such a weird player, [WolveZ] Like he was beating stuff... It was something like people It was like way faster than nswish, like faster than anyone. [Samifying] Put yourself in the mind of At this point, the game has almost of incredible achievements on its back. We went from hating the spectacles of the community. But even then, at this point in 2020, new players were improving This was an era defined of incredibly versatile players, that were beating things Tartarus, the hardest had just received some competition. A new level was just added and some people were saying This means that for the first time a level was actively for the number one spot This is a list that archives and ranks the 150 hardest levels that currently have been completed There was a lot of hype Just like Tartarus, it seemed to push the boundaries It took the Verifier, nSwish, who was considered 2 entire months and 52,000 attempts The moment this happens, a tonne of top players immediately rushed to give it a try and get progress themselves. These players... Included Sviborg, rori, Wolvezz, All players that were names in the community. However, there was one player someone almost nobody had heard of &quot;SpaceUK&quot; This guy was a nobody. To put it bluntly, before this, only some players were actually to begin with. But that's only part of the reason Apparently it was his FIFTH ever Demon. [SpaceUK] I BEAT THE GOLDEN! [Friend] Oh, you did? [SpaceUK] Yeah! Holy $h!t, that was one attempt. (claps) [TrickGMD] That was like- hearing &quot;The Golden&quot;, as a top one, was unheard of... [AeonAir] To the naked eye, he like we knew he existed, and knew he was doing it, but no one really cared [Samifying] This was insane. A demon is the hardest difficulty rating a level can receive, and it is split into 5 subsections, ranging from &quot;Easy Demon&quot; Up until this point, reached extreme demon status, would normally be a monthslong journey, where you would consistently practise and hone your skills for an upcoming battle. You would not just do Playing an extreme demon is one of the toughest and even then, just being categorised doesn't even mean There's tonnes of extreme levels but we only actively keep HERE is why This entire thing This is &quot;SpaceUK&quot;'s progression He started playing the game roughly and then beat his first ever demon &quot;DeCode&quot;. A really easy demon that to playing harder levels in the game. As his second ever demon, he immediately decided to jump &quot;windy landscape&quot;. As his third, he decided to go &quot;Layak&quot;. That already... kinda was amazing. New players should not as their second and third ever. You're supposed to show which intern helps you practise From having a heavy focus to being memory based, there's tonnes of different styles that So what did &quot;Space&quot; do next? [AeonAir] A lot of people give &quot;Space&quot; credit and with jumping, it... basically means going much, significantly harder level. And &quot;Space&quot; was like the *pioneer* Going for the #2 demon [Samifying] it's really hard to put how big of a jump this is. This was the moment that into the mainstream community, and little did people know, that this was *still* just the start. (Frantic Panting) [SpaceUK] Oh, this level is SO $H!T This level is so F______ $h!t. [Samifying] Not only... did he beat the Golden, but three months after that decided and a month after that At this point in time, this player that just came out of nowhere had beaten the entire top five hardest levels ever. He was slowly cementing himself as the fastest improving player and he wouldn't stop there. It was level after level after level. He just started destroying [Varium] It was also just like... to just see someone so nonchalantly, Like, SHRED the entire demon list. [Samifying] Mhm... [Samifying] Mhm... [Samifying] Damn... It seemed like he was here Throughout 2021, he would just be on a tear, gaining more respect and therefore with every completion that he uploaded. It was so insane, in fact, that it would actually lead player of 2021 alongside Crisis, Wolvezz and Trick. But there's probably one more thing It's October the 24th... Tartarus was roughly one month away from having its second anniversary No other level in the history of the game The only one that ever came close with its one year and two-month This is an achievement that would kind of deserve a video on its own. But the reason I'm telling you this Tartarus was denied its 2nd anniversary on the top. [SpaceUK] Ohh. *cough* *HARD CAUGH* ohmygo- I can't F______ react, I'm gonna cough so much. hu h o m y g a w d It was verified by &quot;SpaceUK&quot; in what's known This is when the original creators of the level choose to just race for the verification, almost as a sort of: &quot;Here it is, and good luck.&quot; This means that for the case any of these ten players could have been the first to beat the level legit Whoever survived that first as the player to push the limits of the game And that is exactly what &quot;Space&quot; did. &quot;Space&quot; was *such* a dominant that people were already using it to nominate &quot;Space&quot; Which, we now know, he won! By a landslide, at that. This alone would already but Slaughterhouse was special. It wasn't just the level to one up Tartarus, it was a *L E A P* in difficulty to show you just how much To this day in May 2023, sits on the number four spots OH maoOk whs It is ough chfn fna fn FNNN Tartarus sits at #20. Do you realise how insane that is? The longest surviving level has been pushed down by 21 spots, in one and a half years. As you can see, a LOT of stuff and &quot;Space&quot; would play a really big part in that. People weren't aware of it back then, but the next two years were about as the Slaughterhouse Era. The level would remain on top Which is a testament actually improving. At this point, &quot;Space&quot; had overtaken the rest of the world, and was officially crowned purely based on stats alone. That would be a title that he would hold because you see... he was nowhere near his peak yet. [SpaceUK] I beat Arcturus I think. [Friend] How you literally just got 91% ?! yEEESsSSUUHHH H U y e s l e t s f _ _ _ _ _ _ g o M A N HO MY GOD bru- I cant man this level's sooo baaaad this level's sooo baaaad YES DUDE Oh my God YES ? no no no no ? t h i s i s F _ _ _ _ _ _ h u u h o m y g a w d b r o o o achouuoohmygod YES I just beat K y o u k i. [Friend] No you didn't! [SpaceUK] I DID! I just beat it, ? what ? [Friend] Ohoho. OK. [SpaceUK] Oh my God, OK. hough OK, ool F_____ GO bruh I BEAT ACHERON I JUST BEAT ACHERON x 1 I JUST BEAT ACHERON x 2 I JUST BEAT ACHERON x 3 I JUST BEAT ACHERON x 4 I JUST BEAT ACHERON x 5 I JUST BEAT ACHERON x 6 I JUST BEAT ACHERON x 7 I JUST BEAT ACHERON x 8 [Samifying] At this point, he basically had *can* achieve in this game. Acheron marked the third time that &quot;Space&quot; had conquered a new top one demon over the years. He eventually also went on not only beat the top 20, but the entire main Demonlist. YEAH! all 75 levels completed I can only imagine, were actually looking up to him He must have been such a big inspiration &quot;Space&quot; himself was doing His YouTube channel was popping off, he had garnered the respect and it seemed like he would go down in the games history, for being the best player to ever touch this game. Until April 2023, where one notable dared to ask the question: &quot;Hey Space!&quot; &quot;Why do your clicks not line up I would call this the largest scale we've ever seen in this game. He was forced to confess, it was not He changed an entire two years top player history. I know how much money It wasn't a small amount.
