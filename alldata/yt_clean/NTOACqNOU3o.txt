You might be surprised, but we here at Mythical are And sometimes in polite society, we're forced to pretend to we don't really like. Well, I like everything. Of course. Of course you do. But the Mythical crew is another story. They have a wide array of diverse palates. Some who are picky eaters, and some who can't get weirdest, But are our BS detectors strong enough hater trying to be polite? It's time for... making ourselves look better by Okay, it's time to play Face Detectives. But before I explain what that means, please say hello to our first Hello, first lineup. Jordan. Jordan, Matt, and Rachel. You guys look hungry. Yeah, I love food. And what I was told, is that everyone on our panel either loves or hates. Oh, wow. Okay, but then check if that's the case. Sometimes Chase comes and go ahead. So everyone loves or hates these foods. These polarizing foods. We have to watch them each eat it. Like these oysters. We also will eat it, whether they... like it or hate it. Like, gets a check, hate gets an X. But we don't have to eat it. Right? Did I just make you irrelevant? No, because. Okay, I'll take back my good job on the tip of my tongue. I'm kidding. Yes. You got it all correct. At least one person loves the thing, and at least one person absolutely hates the thing. So it's not like everybody else loves it, And yes, the whole point is that they're because if you guess the one that they're gonna have to that they hate. We're coming for you. What is this? What is this stuff? That's vinegar with onions in it. Trust me. Load it up. Yeah, I want that. This is mine. Load it up with Tabasco. And this sauce, that's the whole point of oysters. It's a delivery mechanism See? And look, even your brow furrowed. I'm concentrating. But you like it? I like vinegar and Tabasco sauce. Would you like to know what it But can you look like you do like it? there's much worse things, I think. It's slimy, it's uncooked. It takes all of these other things what it is you're eating. I don't know why anybody does it. And it can give you a crazy, illness. Well, you know, a bad oyster can. But these are all good oysters, Jordan Myrick, What? Yeah, it's an aphrodisiac. Perfect.

It's one of the best dishes you can pay for because it's expensive, You know, which I love. That's true. That's one of the fanciest people on this panel. Are we discovering that it's impossible? Keep it coming. It's impossible to look like you're I think so. Yeah. I never put the onion thing on it before, and those are. I maybe overdid it. Yeah, it's a little vinegary.

This helps us out a little bit. Oh, that was quick. Oh, that's beautiful. That's excellent. That's excellent. I got no notes on that oyster. I'm gonna sit back. Wow. Wow. Okay, you have to use your whiteboards. Was that... Mm. Since... I don't know. it could have been like a, almost. Every... correct guess on your Every incorrect guess deducts a point. The question is, did you buy the aunt story? Okay, see what you got, Link. I thought that the boys did not actually like it, I thought that everyone... except Jordan Morris liked it. Oh, nobody bought the aunt story. Sorry, I make up a lot of fake aunt It's a tick. Okay, did Matt Lieb actually like it, but kind of lie? I guess. Matt Lieb. Did you. Do you like oysters? You want the real answer? No, I do not. I do not like oysters. Ah, see, I got you. But in Jordan Morris, Do you even have an aunt? I do. I have an auntie Sandra, when I visit her, Which makes it a little more palatable. Makes it easier to lie. It makes it food. Yeah. Right. And not just pure slime. Mm. Okay, Jordan? I love them. Yes. Yeah. They're so luxurious and fancy, and you can put all kinds Yep, yep. A weighted blanket is luxurious. This is slime. I'd love to wear a weighted blanket That sounds incredible. And, Rachel. Yeah, I genuinely love oysters. They're amazing. They're perfect. Jordan's description is exactly right. They're briny and they taste of the sea. So I nailed it across the board. And Jordan Morris, so you gotta have another one. And Matt Lieb, you... Didn't fool me. You didn't fool Link, Can I have a tub of Hidden Maybe that would help. Can someone deep fry it, please? Auntie Sandra... She's too far away. So much Tobasco. There you go. And now you don't have to act. You did that so well. There you go. So that's the face you would have been. That's the Jordan Morris we know and love. This is the face. It is nasty, huh? Oh, the way that... I can hear it in his throat and you're shaking so much. I know. It's like that second one was I'm always shaking because I'm so horny. Okay, we have liver, guys. this is my nemesis. Also, who's joined us over on the What's up, Leonard? Hello, Leonard. You got your own. Oh, liver Leonard, they call him. I knew there was liver and onions, Okay, A lot of times that we it's not prepared in a way But this is, like, seasoned and fried. There's onions over here. I'm really gonna try to give it a chance. I'm a big, big fan of onions. I couldn't fake it if I were you guys. It's just so metallic tasting. I applaud you for trying. I can't do it. I wanted to... It's so bad. I mean... I felt like I was gonna do it that time. You know it's bad when you have to, like. wipe your tongue. I don't understand. Jordan and Rachel, your reactions are... I don't understand. Have you guys seen the show before? I hate it. I'm scared. I'm sorry, y'all. And if it turns out that I mean, likes this. Yep, that's right. No judgment, but a lot of fascination. Let's start with Jordan. All right, I like it. I think I like it because. So my parents don't eat meat. And growing up, I didn't eat meat. Cause my parents don't eat meat. And my grandma would make this. So it was the one meat I got to eat. And I think that felt fun to me. Oh, gosh. Wow. So this could be a fake grandma story. I mean, there's dancing happening. Not flinching. Oh, wait, hold on. This one's a little chewy. Okay. But there's still a smile, kinda. Oh. I can't do it. She did gag. Oh, it was... You were doing so good. You were doing so good. If you don't like it. I really thought I had it. Hey, if you don't like it, isn't it? That was an amazing performance, Myrick. I really thought I paid so much and I really thought I had it, I've had other liver. Ooh, I still feel like I'm gonna throw up. I do not like that. Okay, well, I'll go ahead and put my. I'll go ahead and put my. Wow. You did so good. Just so I don't forget. Yep, that was a true gag. I really almost threw up live But your grandma, that whole story. That was a lie. And it was very believable. Do you even have a grandma? I have a grandma. My whole family doesn't eat meat, really. So that really was. I said I would do this for this show, and I have to stop saying No, but we we're all so entertained by it. I need a Dr. Pepper. Matt Lieb. She making demands. Oh, it's my turn. We're not doing every other. Okay. All right. So I grew up eating liver and onions. And so I think if you haven't then I can see how this is, probably on the list of one of the more you know, But it's actually really good. He's going heavy on those onions. Yeah, that's a lot of onions. All right. You just gotta go. It was chewy because you took a big bite of it. You just want to have a little guy and then some onions, and that's. How, you know you love it. You take a really small bite. That's Right. Yeah. So Just do it. He's stalling so much. I just wanted to explain myself... Like I said, eating it, And it just becomes that's you know? Well, for me, it was... I like it, so. Wow, that's very. He's not. That was a moment of weakness. Moment of weakness, yeah. The swallow's the hard part. We don't go to. It's still in there. It's still in his mouth. Oh, well. But no, no, no. I'm gonna... No, no, we need the completion. Matt Lieb, swallow. I'm going to. It takes a second. Let's move on. Okay, yeah, we'll move on. It's his turn. Leonard, we got to make sure he swallows. He loves it there. There we go. He loves it. Now, I actually also love... I love Dr. I love Dr. Pepper as well. It's okay. So I'm having some, but that says nothing about it. Oh, wow. He gave it a really good college try. Yeah, he did. Leonard. Hey. What's going on? Nothing much. I'm so excited to have this nice Very excited. My dad, he would eat fried chicken livers. So this is beef liver. It's very different. A little onion.
