Hey, it's me, Destin. There's a story that I've been trying and I tried to tell it back Today, we're going to tell that story, Hey, it's me, Destin. Stop and listen for a second. You hear that? If you live anywhere but Antarctica, They're called cicadas. I happen to know an entomologist. We're here at Tamo Plata Research Center. And Phil is going to explain to us [P] So there's a couple There's one part So this is where it's like If you click it, a lot of times However, what's really cool about these actually hollow, and that serves So what we're going to try to get that this is actually [D] Sweet. frames per second, but I'm So that's what Jeff's doing. Jeff is the photo tour guide We struggled to try to get the cicada in the right spot for a long time, We couldn't tell if it was because of our frame rate or if we just didn't I think that thing's opening [P] No way. It actually ended up being six I want you to understand the reality As you've probably heard by now, Some pop out after 13 years, I think we have the 13-year brood here But what I do know is they're You'll be driving down the road windshield wiper and hitch your ride, which blew my mind that he I went to one of my favorite There's just a cicada in the floor. The people that own the restaurant, But if the door opens for any amount It's just going to happen. Notice. Just everywhere. This particular tree, for some reason, look at all the holes in the ground Oh, my goodness. That's nuts. What tree is this? And then these are all their... I guess they're called shells, It's nuts. It doesn't smell great. It's inches thick. It's crazy. That is a lot cicadas. So to be clear, these cicada exoskeletons are the result of the cicadas, for years and years and years, depending They've been living underground, sucking They come up out of the ground, and then they go, they hang on a tree, they have these wings, And what we've been trying to show with that video in Peru, here, we were trying to show what's making so loud, that tymbal Now, the fact that this camera couldn't show it is a significant thing because So today we're going to try to continue telling the story with this camera, But the problem is we need a cicada, and I have misplaced the one I had here, This is George. [D] It's time. [G] It's overwhelmingly. We have to. [D] We have to do it. [G] Well, we have to try. [D] So here's the deal. It's 2024. The cicadas are out in force. My understanding is only one I don't really know all that. [G] It's a big brood, though. [G] I don't remember it being this loud. [D] It's crazy. We're going to get out of the truck It's insane. We're on a wildlife refuge, So how would you describe this? There's two sounds, right? [G] Yeah, there's a high pitch clicking. [G] And then somehow underneath it, when a subway train is pulling when it's still 100 yards down [D] It's like the slipping [G] Yes, that's exactly what it is, [D] So I'm looking at this truck. [G] I've been trying to think of what is You just connected it for me. [D] I think this this is a... This might be a wildlife refuge, guy. [G] It is, it's US government. How's it going? [D] Are you all wildlife refuge people? [D] I'm making a video. [M] Yeah. [M] Oh, okay. I'm Destin. [M] Hi, I'm McKenzie. [D] Mckenzie. [T] Tyler. [M] We're Pathways intern [T] Us Fish and Wildlife Service. [Both] Yes, we are. [M] They're loud. [T] Cicadas, they're loud and obnoxious. I know there's different types of groups of cicadas that are not I don't know if this is the 13 but I think they're all coming up around [D] Where is they the loudest? [T] They'll be around the edges of the trees. That's what I think anyway. [M] They're louder right here than [T] Deep into the wood, yeah. [M] We've noticed on outside edges, it'd be louder, but we've noticed [D] Can you write us a cicada permit [M] I cannot. [G] This is an app, and it tells you the decibel level, See, it'll start doing data. I think that top band, the high band, Then the very consistent one is [D] The subway car sound? And now our voices are So if we let it rip for a second. What I want to know is what What causes the bottom one? Is there two different animals doing one Is there a call and response, Is it one creature making [D] So there's clearly two sounds going And one of the smartest people I know when He makes all the slow motion sound To top it all off, the first time I ever collaborated with Gordon, which actually incorporates generated I made a slow motion video of bottles blowing up, and Gordon So let's ask Gordon what's going on. All right, this is Gordon, He does all the audio and the music you're Gordon wrote it. [G] I did. [G] Yes. [D] Out in the field, we saw two frequencies, What is this? [D] Spectrum analyzer. [G] Yeah, totally. [George from audio recording] Are you screen recording? I'm recording the data. [D] All right, so can you show us what's [G] Okay, we have two distinct One is between 1,000 and 1,200 hertz, and then the other is roughly 3, If we listen to them separately. [D] So that's what George says One of the teachers around here said it [G] Yeah, it's cool. the one that most of us would recognize [D] So here's the question. What's the street car sound and thing? [G] My guess is that these are I think that would be the first thing we animals, but we can see that they are My second guess is that the cicada is which is interesting because that requires I bet it maths out, you'll see [D] Using the information we got from the Wildlife Refuge interns, yards away from the Tennessee River, We need a net. Why do we not have a net? [G] There's going to be one right here. [D] Oh, they're doing it. They're making other cicadas. Oh, dude, can I see that? [D] This seems to be the point. Look at this. They're mating. What are you doing under there? [G] Well, two cicadas love [D] This is how they make baby cicadas. There's a question I have. If these things come out every Do they plant eggs? [G] Yeah. [D] Got one. [G] There you go. [D] Get in there. Two. [G] We have four. [D] We've got four cicadas. Oh, they're loud. [G] I think we got to go do [D] Yeah, let's go try slow-mo. This The cicada hunting trip took longer than expected, so we rushed back to try one slow-mo shot before Hit it. All right, we're going to see something. [G] You can see it. You can see it moving, yeah. [G] Holy cow. So that's the tymbal. This is 25,000 frames per second. [Both] Ohhh!!! It's like a reed, and this is like hollow [D] Okay, the bad news is I found The good news is it has the exact type of lid I need because it's the same type Okay, so look at this. When you click this thing like this, But when you put it on a resonant chamber, I don't know if you can hear that, That's how the abdomen of a cicada works. It's hollow on the end there. And so as the tymbal is vibrating, it is resonating in the abdomen down Now, imagine instead of just one tymbal imagine if we had a can like this and we It would be much louder. But it's not just louder I've read some papers and they all It looks like because you have a tymbal that it's something called constructive Now, the cool thing about the cicada right of the hollow abdomen, you've got a tymbal So that acts like the two cans like this, They're folding back and dithering or whatever we're going to figure So when they're producing sound, And because they're opposite each other at exactly the same time, at the same time, and they hit and add I think that's amazing. And the thing that's really Like these jars, like these jars Like I was expecting, there seems to be a lot Your face, dude, is like, what? [G] I know that- [D] Look at it. We were at 25,000 frames per second. If we knew the frequency of the sound, [G] The vibrate. We ran out of light, from a gas station and we So I got a cricket bucket. They should be able to go So it's an open top. Open top. We got to transfer our most &quot;cicadas do not eat.&quot; [G] You get it? [G] Yeah, that's one. [Destin laughing and giggling] [D] He's loud. That was nice. [D] That was backhand. That was impressive. That made up for a couple of the other After we collected all of our cicadas for the day, we put them We remembered not to eat them, and then This time, we were going to try Get it. [D] Yeah, we got it. Then we ramped it up to 110,000 If you look at several of the clicks over a sequence, if you realign it so that you you can see that the depth controlling the tymbal is different on different strokes. We wanted to see the tymbal really, really close at really high speed, macro to a 65 MPE, which is basically a I don't think the muscle is pulling and relaxing. [G] It's pulling and it's getting each And so it looks like it's going dung, [D] Pull vibrate, pull vibrate, pull vibrate I think that's what's happening [G] But I think it has to overcome the the stress force of each of these. So then that's what each one it goes. So it pops, pops, pops. [D] I'm imagining an arch, And it's easier to buckle a longer arch So if you pull from one side and you start pulling in, Progressive buckling, is that a thing? A direct approach In case buckling occurs due It's intentional buckling. [G] Progressive buckling. [D] Progressive buckling. We're just making words up. [G] We are, but somebody else has used them. [G] In a scientific Okay, so we can clearly see what's but it's not obvious how this It's time to go show this [G] It looks like it's caving in. It looks uncomfortable. [G] One, two, three. One, two, three. -One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. so it's three, four time or triplets, [D] So if you look at the tymbal in slow-mo, It's like you've got all these striations or these pleats, and they're buckling But as they buckle, they each wobble. So it's like, buckle, wobble, wobble, and that happens all the way up, So now we can look at the spectrogram We have this mechanical device that's and then we have this spectrogram My guess are that the wobbles correlate on the spectrogram, and the buckling, the But I don't really know, so I don't want to come down definitively time analysis and measure the delay Furthermore, as millions of cicadas area, who knows what I think it's so cool that years ago, Gordon wrote a song called Cicada's Waltz tymbal of a cicada works I think that's awesome. [soft guitar music starts] We have a problem. We have all of these cicadas The way I want to release them incorporates the sponsor Dan at Ridge said, Destin, we would love for you to incorporate our I'm going to test I don't think they were thinking I'll tell you about Ridge as I think that'll be fine. Oh, get it, get it, [G] I did it. This is my wallet. It's called a Ridge Wallet. I'm going to tell you why this is in your pocket, like credit cards, I love this thing. My favorite thing about it is that I I like being able to pull out It's a big deal. But let me tell you some reasons Number one, That's a lot of people. Number two, it's crazy customizable. You can get whatever color you want. It comes with a little screwdriver. You can do a money clip or a money strap, like a cash strap, or you can even You can take it apart. Just the act of putting You can also personalize certain models of somebody you're giving Ridge has a new type of wallet that will stick to your phone with MagSafe, But the question is, If you don't love it, after 99 days, They give you your money back. If you don't, you get your money back, But you will love it I genuinely think it's the answer, Go to ridge.com/smarter when you do that, I have asked them if they would throw it's awesome, and it Ridge is only doing this If you go to ridge.com/smarter, when you spend at least 76 you can get an AirTag money If you want the free AirTag money clip, and then at checkout, use the promo code That lets them know that you came incentivize them to sponsor So you'd be doing me a solid. Plus, you'd get the coolest I genuinely believe that so Ridge.com/smarter check it out. If you're an academic and you think this cicada tymbal footage would I would love to communicate about that and see if we can figure out some The thing I haven't seen described in the literature so far is this So, yeah, reach out.
