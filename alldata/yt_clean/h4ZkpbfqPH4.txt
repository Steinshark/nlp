I'm going to clear Karl of Karl, when did you come back? - I just did. Can we talk about how perfect that was? Guys, are we going to talk about If we're being honest, That was the best thing Initially I thought Courage But now that Courage is dead, I have to trust his word It could be Karl killed 5up, Well, I don't think so either.

I don't know what to do. I don't know where to go. I don't know to go. One of them is 5up and I He was about to go before No, I just checked vitals Nah, yeah... I still think 5up didn't - He was running in circles. I would never make a mistake. 5up and Courage were I wouldn't kill Courage if But I did see you both walk by me. And what I'm thinking was supposed - so that way, there's no way I would...
