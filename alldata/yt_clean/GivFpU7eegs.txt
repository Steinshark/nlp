Pam, you're so pretty. You are everything. I had plans to meet a friend tonight, which I had to cancel, but this is cool too. I'm not a complainer. Wow. For the bugs. Nice. And that's excellent because bugs love my famous grilled cheese sandwich. Wow. Nice. I can't remember the last time someone made me dinner. Hey, hey. We can go. That's fine. Uh, not a bad day. You know, you don't have to answer calls during a party. Um, just thought you should know. No, I was just, um, checking out my present. But I traded with Dwight. Um, just. I figured, you know, you went to a lot of trouble, and it means a lot. And also, Roy got me an iPod, or, uh, was going to get me an iPod, so. Well, either way, this is an amazing gift because it comes with bonus gifts. Look inside. Oh my God. The yearbook picture. Yeah, I think I made the right choice. Oh my God. It's incredible. Is this the boggle timer? I didn't think you were gonna get that one. I really did, not that one. I do not think that is funny. Jinx. Buy me a Coke. Oh, no no, no no talking. Jim is not allowed to talk until after he buys me a Coke. Those are the rules of jinx, and they are unflinchingly rigid. Sold out. That is never happened in the history of jinx. Sorry, that's not my problem. Quick. So I guess I'll see you in ten hours. What are you gonna do with your time off? Travel? Yeah, I've been looking forward to it. It's gonna be. Really nice. I'm gonna find myself. Do you have new music? Yeah. Definitely. I did the coal walk. Just. I did it, Michael. You couldn't even do that. Maybe I should be your boss. Wow. I feel really good right now. Why didn't any of you come to my art show? I invited all of you. That really sucked. It's like sometimes some of you act like I don't even exist. Jim, I called off my wedding because of you, and now we're not even friends. And things are just, like, weird between us. And that sucks. And I miss you. You're my best friend before you went to Stanford. And I really miss you. I shouldn't have been with Roy. And there were a lot of reasons to call off my wedding. But the truth is, I didn't care about any of those reasons until I met you. And now you're with someone else, and that's fine. It's whatever. That's not what I'm. I'm not okay. My feet really hurt. The thing that I'm just trying to say to you, Jim, and to everyone else in the circle, I guess, is that I miss having fun with you. Just you. Not everyone in the circle. Okay, I am going to go walk in the water now. Yeah, it's a good day. Pam. That was amazing. But I am still looking for someone with a sales background. We're friends and I'm sure we'll stay friends. We just. We never got the timing right. You know, I shot him down, and then he did the same to me, and. But you know what? It's okay. I'm totally fine. Everything is going to be totally fine. Sorry. Um, are you free for dinner tonight? Yes. All right then, it's a date. I'm sorry. What was the question? Margaret, I know you just got yourself kicked out of your apartment. Oh, I don't care. I don't really like that place that much anyway. I'll just move. Oh, really? Who's gonna take you in? You're messy. You're a klutz. You spill everything, and you leave the volume on the TV way too loud. Yeah. Maybe I'll just move in with my boyfriend because he's kind of a slob, too. Okay, sure. Let's do it. No, I, um, well, I'm not gonna. I'm. I'm not going to move in with anyone unless I'm engaged. Have I not proposed to you yet? I don't know. Oh, no. Well. That's coming. Oh. Right now. No, I can't do it right here. That would be rather lame. Okay, so then when. Pam, I'm not going to tell you. I hate to break it to you, but that's not how that works. Oh, right. Yeah. Wait. I'm serious. It's happening. Okay. And when it happens, it's going to kick your ass, Beesly. So stay sharp. I've been warned. I am not kidding. Got it a week after we started dating. What have we got here? Good pizza. Yeah. Cheese. Or do we have other flavors or different stuff? Which one's this? Perfect. Do you remember what you said to me on my first day at work? Just before you walked me over to my desk? Yeah. Enjoy this moment, because you're never going to go back to this time before you met your desk mate, Dwight. And that's why I knew you. You came up to my desk and you said, this might sound weird, and there's no reason for me to know this, but that mixed berry yogurt you're about to eat has expired. That was the moment that you knew you liked me. Yep. Wow. Can we make it a different moment? Nope. I did something bad. Huh? I stole this for you, Pam. You took me. By the hand. Maybe up there that one night. One night. My veil tore. I knew when we were getting married and I'm five months pregnant, that I'm not going to be able to wear the dress that I always wanted or high heels. Hey. You look just as I imagine you. Pam, you're so pretty. Yeah. Thank you. Who cares? It's a stupid veil, right? No. This is the one thing I was supposed to be able to control. Was this veil. There. Now we're even. Is it? Is it pebbles from that beach in Jamaica? Oh, go easy with the shaking. Oh my God. Well, you like it. I love it. Yeah, I do make great Christmas gifts, but I couldn't make that. All right, my turn. Oh, um. It's just I didn't I didn't have a lot of time, so that's just a placeholder, right? Of course. The Adventures of Jimmy Halpert. Oh, my God, this is awesome. That's my bike. That's my desk and that is my daughter. I mean. Just you and me. Let go! Yeah. Oh, yeah. Like that. Oh, there we go. You got it. Five tickets on the windshield. Hey. Hi. We did it. You used my move, didn't you? I used a variation of your move. It was like a little gentle. Deep jolt. To be honest, I still can't believe he didn't call her back. Who doesn't call a dork like that back? Oh, wow. Spinach in a can. Power from spinach. Ga GA GA GA GA GA GA. Oh my hero. All right, I'm going to go warm up the car. Okay, okay. Oh, you dropped something, Jim. Okay, I know I've been crying easily today, but. I mean, that's just pretty killer, right? I mean, maybe it's stupid. No. It's wonderful. I'm going to frame it. I can always unframe. Oh, you saved this. And I won't waste a minute without you. You watched it? Yeah. Well, then I guess you're ready for this. What's that? It's from the teapot. Everything you'll ever need to know. Is in that note . Not enough for me. You are everything. Thank you.
