I'm Tian Boon Keng, 36 years old I joined a secret society I gambled, stole, swindled, took drugs I'm a rotten guy beyond redemption Boon Keng became addicted to gambling and accumulated a huge debt to loan sharks He then started taking drugs Due to the various crimes he committed, he was sent to prison four times I started to gamble and owed a lot of money The loan sharks then asked me They said I just needed to splash paint... and write some words on the wall... and I will get $50 I did this for slightly over one year The first time Boon Keng was sent to prison, he was sentenced to 16 months in jail I was very scared when I first learnt about I heard it would be very painful Some people fainted after the caning After the first stroke, The second stroke was slightly better Boon Keng didn't turn over a new leaf He only felt it was very boring... and returned to his old ways The moment I was released, my friend came to fetch me I didn't change my ways My life simply revolved around taking drugs, After I got tired of stealing, Then when I got tired of that, It was an endless cycle Boon Keng was mired in a cycle Shortly after his release, during a random inspection... and was sent to After his discharge, his girlfriend and he became a father It was a shotgun marriage Things happened very quickly... and we got married in a rush After having a kid, I initially wanted to change myself I took up two jobs as a private hire driver Both jobs took up a lot of my time to cover my expenses I then thought about getting a third job... and wondered how to make it work There was a drug I took before I needed it so that I could continue working After taking the drug, I could continue working for days However, it produced I became controlled by the drug I gave up my third job, and eventually my first job I started to have criminal thoughts Since I couldn't earn enough money out of desperation, I would go to the supermarket I would steal from 8 am to 5 pm, sometimes even till 11 pm Boon Keng turned to illegal means... to support his living expenses He later turned himself in, However, things didn't turn out I was sentenced to 10 months in jail... but could be released after 6 months During this period, She asked for a divorce, Boon Keng was hopeful yet, what awaited him She also didn't allow Boon Keng to go home The reason why I went to prison initially... was because I wanted to rebuild my family However, things took a complete turn It made me feel that going to jail I felt bitter for not being able to see and my mother also fell ill There were many things I couldn't accept To escape, I started to take drugs again I gave up on my life I told myself that it didn't matter I didn't owe anyone anything Boon Keng became homeless He could only sleep at the void decks staircases or the self-service laundromat I couldn't go back because my father is a very traditional man If he knew that his son he would probably dislike my ex-wife Those days were very tough so I just lay down to rest People would give me looks as if thinking why such a young man I had to get up around 4 or 5 am... before the morning crowd I was completely aimless during that time My life felt useless and meaningless Fortunately, Boon Keng At a time when he most needed help, he got in touch with an ex-offender friend... who helped him to find a job There was a delivery driver job so I went for the interview After earning my salary on the first day, I thought to myself that since I needed a place to stay Boon Keng found a budget hostel and settled down there for the time being He was finally sheltered from the elements, but he felt lonely and angry deep inside My family is quite traditional My father favoured sons I have two brothers and three sisters Among my siblings, When my father brought us out, he would describe me and a future garbage collector Actually, Boon Keng's mother although he was unaware of it My mother loved me a lot Every day, when I came home from work, She brought us up since young, doing all the cooking, laundry and all that Whenever I caused trouble in school, or was arrested for fighting and needed bail, or when I needed money, she was always there for me She was a person of a few words... and a little old-fashioned But her love for me was the purest Before Boon Keng's fourth incarceration, his mother bailed him out My mother had cancer then, but she still came to bail me out... even though she had difficulty walking I jumped bail in the end So, I ran away She kept telling me that that she was getting on in age She told me to turn over a new leaf She also kept telling me... to live a simple lifestyle... and that would be good enough I must stop doing all that bad stuff It was for my own good, but I didn't understand Despite repeated attempts to jump bail Boon Keng couldn't escape the law ultimately Never did he expect that he would be forever separated When I was in prison for the fourth time, and saw a familiar face I paused for a while That's what I kept telling myself... before I flipped back to that page... and saw that face again I didn't know or it could be that She had called me three months ago I was stunned for a moment I saw my name, my father's I broke down on the spot I went to a corner where no one could and hit myself a few times Throughout my life, my mother was the only one Her love and care for me... were unconditional and unwavering You could say that... I suddenly lost my pillar of support I couldn't accept it While Boon Keng he suddenly came across His family didn't inform him at all He had to face the pain of losing and the realization of being abandoned Boon Keng's mother passed away It was a huge blow to him He remembered which made it very hard for him to let go In this world, the person My biggest regret was wasting my time which caused me to lose the chance... to see my mother for the last time No one can take away this regret My mother left with regrets Only she had the key, so there is nothing in this world No matter how much my mother can no longer see it I have let her down After his release, Boon Keng decided At the Hair for Hope event organized by he shaved his head to fundraise I just want to remember my mother What about it? She had cancer, so she left in 2022 Today is Boon Keng's mother's He bought tea and went back to his old home Although his mother is no longer his family members have started to accept him I hope for him to be successful, earn money and get a wife Mending ties with his family He's already in his thirties, Boon Keng is very relieved that... he can get along with his father now As he rebuilds his life, One important person... is his current fiancee I call her my fiancee I feel that there is no one better than her I already knew her before I went to jail I was at the lowest period of my life then She had to endure a lot of hardships such as having to sleep in the car But she has never complained She is very nice to me So, I really love her a lot CNA once documented A manager at a training academy and wanted to employ him I'm Jefferson Tan, I asked my friend if Boon Keng needed a job I got my friend to ask him When he arrived, &quot;Thank you for giving me a chance!&quot; It was so loud that everyone turned I then quickly brought him into a room By chance, Boon Keng met another person... who was willing and assist him on his journey He's a very important benefactor in my life He has given me a lot of support Whenever there's an opportunity he will try his best to arrange it for me I always ask myself... why is this manager so good to me?
