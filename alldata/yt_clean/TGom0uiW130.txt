[narrator] In 1903, the Wright brothers made kick-starting the age of aviation. Or did they? I don't know that we really of the airplane flying in 1903. [man] When I found out is really nothing more I didn't like people lying to me. [narrator] Australian aviation expert is on a quest to reassess There's now solid evidence but Gustave Whitehead was the first person [narrator] Could German inventor be the true contender for the crown? It's a claim that has outraged many... There is no evidence that I buy to suggest that he ever left the ground. [narrator] ...including [man as Orville] Whitehead did not possess to build a successful motor, Release! [narrator] Was Gustave Whitehead or a genius discredited I know he flew. [narrator] Did the Wright brothers Was history fixed by a special arrangement with America's greatest This contract dictates what version [man] If the price of telling the truth to me, a museum tells the truth. [narrator] The Wright brothers Who really kick-started Flight. One of humanity's It's celebrated here in Washington, DC, Center stage is the plane The Wright brother's Flyer from 1903, But is everything really as it seems? In 2011, an Australian aviation expert began research John Brown came across evidence that challenged the Wright brothers' Sensational pictures showing a motorized plane As a pilot and aircraft builder, was... everything's in the right place. This plane can fly. [narrator] The plane was built but who was this man The rumor was two years before the Wright brothers. So why isn't this plane also honored In Munich, where he works as John Brown set out to uncover the truth. [Brown] The first thing I did that have newly become available and that nobody had known about, [narrator] It was the beginning into Gustave Whitehead's flights, taking him to museums, on both sides of the Atlantic, revealing crucial new sources Brown wanted to know, been deliberately erased from history? As he continued to dig, in a bitter dispute spanning over one of the greatest the world's first powered flight. In the 1930s, for the coveted first flight crown. The most fervent contender was who claimed that he had made the first motorized flight But in 1934... -[knock on door] ...researcher and writer of an explosive document that challenged -You mentioned an interesting article? It's in a special collection, [narrator] The New York newspaper report detailing a flight by in Bridgeport, Connecticut. [Brown] She was fascinated. Her father had been a fan and she looked at this and said, &quot;This article is about two years before the Wright brothers.&quot; So, at the height of the Great Depression, a single woman on a low salary decided to research the story [narrator] By 1937, Stella had expanded detailing the names of people It contained 11 by people attesting to Whitehead's flights [Brown] This book changed the perception quite considerably. But when the Second World War came along, uh, Stella Randolph's efforts to prove that a German had flown before [narrator] Until her death in 1989, Stella Randolph campaigned to have But her evidence fell on deaf ears. In 1948, the Smithsonian recognized the Wright brothers And today in Kitty Hawk, more than half a million people So what had happened to Stella's claim As Brown expanded his research, he began to suspect that there He discovered an article quoting one of Whitehead's [man as Orville] Whitehead never succeeded He was eccentric, a visionary, to such an extent that he actually [narrator] Today, America's is inclined to agree. Did Gustave Whitehead fly? You can't say no, But I don't think the evidence not within a country mile, So if he did fly, um, the evidence We haven't seen it. [narrator] John Brown was not going In search of new evidence, he travelled to the German town where Whitehead was born in 1874. A local museum is dedicated whose original name was Gustav Weisskopf before he changed it The main item in the collection of Whitehead's plane, the No. 21, and what Brown discovered from it There are two ways of looking that's conjured up is it looks a bit But the remarkable thing about Whitehead and most aeroplanes these days so he was ahead of his time on that. And the layout, the way the four vectors is reminiscent of modern aeroplanes. There's not much we do We have different materials, but we don't [propellers whirring] [narrator] The museum is run by a group who believe that history needs to be Their archive is a treasure trove including background Even in his youth, as his younger brother Nicholas wrote. [man as Nicholas] About Gustave's youth, was to fly little open balloons with attached corks or candles. [narrator] On the other side Whitehead's future competitors, were equally fascinated by flight. -You think that's good? [narrator] A flying toy left a profound impact Two, one... [man] A toy so delicate it only lasted but its memory was abiding. [narrator] What the Wrights and Whitehead was their interest in the German [man] Lilienthal, on first appearance, that they always show when they show when the things go straight down, because what he did was and he ran down the hill and glided. That seems like almost But before he did that, Lilienthal had taken tens of thousands of aerofoils, to determine which would be He made 2,000 glides, so, in fact, rather than being he turned out to be the pioneer that inspired the Wright brothers [narrator] Lilienthal's revolutionary One day, it would also become Whitehead basically did He basically just put an engine The only thing he had to change is he had to put this fuselage in here, And Whitehead himself, he stood here and from there he steered the plane. [narrator] Here in his hometown, A memorial commemorates him for having conducted Andy, how are you? [narrator] Overseas, there are others Including the US state of Connecticut. In Bridgeport, physics teacher built a replica of Whitehead's He claims he has proven Well, I heard about it at a lecture and I said, &quot;Gee, this looks I think I could build this aeroplane.&quot; We need a safety wire on here to make sure I started all by myself and offered to help. Many of these people were older men, in their 70s and 80s, but they knew They'd learned it from their parents. Some of them even knew people So they joined in with me We took it out to Bridgeport Airport. Started taxiing, just moving Then it just leapt [narrator] A decade later, the Leutershausen Museum's replica evidence that Whitehead had designed two years before the Wright brothers. But it doesn't prove Critics say that Whitehead couldn't possibly have to get his plane off the ground. [typewriter keys clacking] This criticism harks back to a quote [man as Orville] Whitehead did not possess to build a successful motor, [narrator] So, was Whitehead a dreamer Brown now focused on this question. [in German] Here are the negatives. [narrator] How could a poor young man acquire the skills to produce engines Germany in the 1880s was one According to recently discovered articles young Whitehead trained as a fitter at one of Germany's leading Yet Gustave never lost sight The question was where to pursue it The answer was a job at sea, [Brown] At the time, sailing boats Working with the sails was one part of what The other part was keeping [narrator] Around 1894, Whitehead's years [bell clanging] [thunder crashes] His ship ran into some trouble in two separate places, which is known as &quot;the ship's graveyard.&quot; That's when he decided to stay on land. [narrator] Gustave Whitehead From now on he would be dedicated Brown's next stop was the United States, became a leading pioneer of aviation. Newspaper articles from the 1890s and a remarkable discovery about [Brown] He was employed here called the Boston Aeronautical Society, and it was the official representative the German glider designer, here in the United States, and Whitehead was the one and all of the weather kites [narrator] At last Whitehead was able Responsible for constructing his work was published Soon after, the young aspiring aviator embarking on one of the most By day, the 25-year-old worked but at night in his workshop, to attach to his gliders. Pass me the file. [narrator] He later claimed he first attempted to fly His critics say the Pittsburgh flight Yet in 1934, Stella Randolph who'd been in the plane Please. I flew with Mr. Whitehead on the occasion when he succeeded in flying his machine, [narrator] Mechanic Louis Darvarich stated half a mile down a Pittsburgh street. But this 1899 flight was regarded because despite being airborne, So who should we believe? The critics or the testimony To check, Brown and researcher Paul Beck unavailable to Stella Randolph. Just one year ago, nothing was known except what Stella Randolph Now we have more than 30 articles We know where he took off and we also know where he so we can confirm that it was This is the first time It's the first time I'm going to see made his first powered flight attempt. So it's all very interesting [narrator] Next day, Brown and Paul Beck team up with local historian Leading up here, is the location where Gustave which is Magee-Women's Hospital, He would have taken off, straight down Valmont Street, where he [Brown] Where exactly did he hit? There. Approximately right [narrator] Brown is convinced. If Whitehead's plane the age of motorized flight a point never acknowledged Instead, the enduring story were the pioneers of aviation. As young men in the 1890s, they started a successful business The demand for It laid the foundation one of America's [Goldstone] They were two -[camera shutter snaps] [photographer] Thanks, boys. Wilbur was a genius. He was one of the great instinctive Orville was a great technician, but Orville did not have Wilbur's genius. [narrator] After 1899, the Wright brothers But they needed light-weight engines just like the ones invented by Whitehead. And here, the two stories Around the time Wilbur Wright received a letter recommending Whitehead's engines. Wilbur responded enthusiastically. [man as Wilbur Wright] is certainly a wonder Even if the inventor it still would be an extremely Yours truly, Wilbur Wright.&quot; [narrator] By 1901, had moved to Bridgeport, Connecticut. -How much longer will you be? [narrator] Whitehead had secured to fund a new plane design Did the Wright brothers During her research, who claim they saw the Wright brothers In a sworn affidavit, one of them describes the scene [man as Steves] &quot;I, Cecil A. Steves, to my best knowledge and belief. When a boy, I lived only one block It was here that the Wright brothers during the early 1900s, coming from Ohio under the guise of offering to help finance [Gustave] It's very light-weight. [as Steves] &quot;They actually received inside in completing their own plane. I was at the shop and waited outside After they'd gone away, 'Now since I have given them they will probably never do anything this proving to have been [narrator] Steves repeated his story But for some reason it has never gained [Crouch] That just isn't true. Unlike Whitehead, the Wrights, not only in diaries and letters but their father's diary, and when people adamantly claim, I just say, &quot;Nonsense,&quot; and I see that as proof that I'm not going to the rest of what you say [narrator] What we do know for certain Gustave's work on his new plane We should have this working in no time. [narrator] The result was the plane Gustave's 21st flyer, The design was based on one that he'd built, but bigger and with an undercarriage Whitehead decided risking his life once again to become At the same time, the Wright brothers were still harnessing the strong coastal winds After two years of experimenting, an engine was attached A first attempt, on the 14th [plane crashing] But the flyer was soon repaired. Three days later, on the 17th of December, According to Orville Wright's diaries, It's a story well known to historians [Crouch] They made The first one was only 120 feet They took turns and, uh, so Wilbur made the fourth flight. And on that flight, he travelled He was in the air almost a minute that they had achieved sustained flight. [narrator] The Wright brothers conducted Back in the early 1900s, To answer their critics, five years after the event, in 1908. That was one of the most reprinted historically significant pictures The very first flight, and when you look you will see that the flyer [narrator] But how much can we trust Visiting Kitty Hawk is aeronautical design Bullmer is an expert in and reported Congress and the White House. He has discovered in the Wright brothers' [Bullmer] The Wright brothers unless you flew at least a tenth that you hadn't proven anything. any flight shorter than 300 feet and proved nothing, But this flight is portrayed by many but in fact, the airplane only went that they felt was a minimum for success, and as you can see, this elevator here That was a problem because and it would flop either and that's why Orville went up, down, and then hit the ground So this flight, really, by was not a success. [narrator] According to the first three flight attempts But the fourth flight did qualify, So, what is the evidence for this? This is supposedly a picture But the propeller blades so the engine was stopped either on the ground So, this is at or very near Now, the Wright brothers claimed went 852 feet in 59 seconds. However, the mensuration using standard shows that aeroplane to be between 300 and 340 feet not 852. Not only that, when we look we notice that the wing is bent Now that's characteristic but the next thing is that there What are they? [narrator] The question is puzzling. Close-ups of the Wright brothers' show a horizontally mounted engine nothing that would look like In contrast, this footage of flown in 1908 shows two people sitting Three blobs from a distance. So these three blobs are much more than a 1903. The Wrights did bring the two-seat model and they flew it dozens of times So, I really am not a hundred percent sure [chuckles] Whether it is, in fact, I don't think the photography by itself [narrator] Joe Bullmer's analysis suggests that proof of the Wright brothers' relies essentially on the journal Orville Wright. [Goldstone] One of the key issues is, can we verify that they did How reliable are they, and how reliable were the people who claim Now, in the Wright brothers' case, they were out in Kitty Hawk with and Orville claimed his fourth flight There is no independent verification, except &quot;the Wright brothers did not lie.&quot; [announcer] And there it goes! [narrator] So do attempts to replicate vindicate Orville Wright's story? [announcer] He's working hard! [woman] Aww, crap! [Bullmer] No one has had any success In fact, the farthest that I know of is about 130 feet. Many people have gotten injured and two people got killed. [narrator] Five months after Kitty Hawk, the Wright brothers invited the press of their latest flyer near Dayton, Ohio. The day was a disaster, Yet by 1905, the Wright brothers managed to get a modified version These first moving pictures By now the Wright brothers had taken out for their control system. With that patent, they tried to either or take ten percent They ended up spending a lot of time [narrator] One long wrangling case The judge that adjudicated their case admitted that he was because they were [Brown] For the Wright brothers, about inventing the aeroplane That's quite well illustrated when you see what happened after They put no effort into developing They put all their effort who tried to fly an aeroplane. [narrator] Wilbur died in 1912. But by the 1920s, was busy writing the history of aviation, placing himself and his late brother Based on the Kitty Hawk flights, Orville built a strong reputation [newsreader] The nation's tribute [narrator] But in the mid-1930s, Stella Randolph's book threatened to torpedo At the heart of her book was attributed to the respected journalist in the Bridgeport Sunday Herald, published more than two years claimed flights at Kitty Hawk. Howell's account began in the early hours as Whitehead was heading for a field He wrote... [man as Howell] &quot;By this time The nervous tension was -Do you think you can get this to fly? Well, good luck. Start the engine. Let's go. [Howell] &quot;It was an exciting moment.&quot; And release! [man] The machine darted up through The newspaperman and the two assistants watching the airship in amazement. She was flying now [narrator] According to Howell's article, Stella Randolph knew but she also knew she had to convince the world Travelling to Bridgeport she found people still talking about Many claimed to have seen Whitehead fly I was present when Mr. Whitehead succeeded in flying his machine propelled by motor. The distance flown was approximately one mile and a half. The first flights made by Mr. Whitehead lasted approximately five minutes time. [narrator] Stella required in front of a notary. [Brown] She came up with This number and diversity of sources is something that would as clear and convincing evidence. This is way beyond a shadow of a doubt. [narrator] When Stella Randolph she hoped Whitehead would be recognized as the aviator who made But she hadn't banked on Orville Wright When, in 1945, referred to Whitehead one of Orville's friends was alarmed. [man] Reader's Digest, July, page 57. Whitehead. Feel this should be dynamited. [narrator] With much to lose Orville set out to destroy writing the influential 1945 article, First, Orville cherry-picked who said Whitehead hadn't flown. I, James Dickie, worked [narrator] James Dickie was mentioned as one of those present I believe the entire story I was not present and did not witness on August 14, 1901. [narrator] Brown believes Dickie's Well, the thing that Dickie in the first few lines I was not present. Now, somebody who was not there I believe the entire story So, why did Mr. Dickie say this? Well, another thing Mr. Dickie said and then had never repaid him. [narrator] Orville's second attack caused the most damage centered on an unsigned statement attributed to Whitehead's He paraphrased Beach saying... [man as Orville] &quot;Although Beach in the years from 1901 to 1910, Whitehead never told him Beach has said that he does not believe that any of Whitehead's machines [narrator] Brown believes because it directly contradicts when Beach was aeronautical editor [Brown] This is It's almost three months to the day to have flown on December 17th of 1903. What it tells us is that Whitehead to this glider. The plane was made to skim without the pilot touching the ground about 300 meters. [narrator] It appears that Beach changed after the two men Conveniently, Orville's article quoted by Stella and by the 1960s, a total of 17 eyewitnesses But the Smithsonian Institution We all know what problems there are and I just discount the witness testimony. I, Anton Pruckner, was acquainted with the late Gustave Whitehead and was employed by him in the construction of motors and heavier-than-air flying machines. Their memories were so vague. Uh, they weren't necessarily memories I was present and assisted on the occasion when Mr. Whitehead succeeded propelled by a motor. I was present when Mr. Whitehead succeeded in flying his machine propelled by motor. The dates, uh, in many of those 14th of August 1901. September or October 1901. [narrator] In his scathing article, Orville also attacked of Whitehead's first flight. [man as Orville] &quot;The strangest part that Howell's article I think the article in the August 18th may have been Richard Howell and just putting it down on paper. It may well have been something like that, [narrator] But Brown disagrees. He believes the article [Brown] The evidence for Whitehead's Besides the chief editor there are two other witnesses who confirm having seen Whitehead fly We know now that all four also reported Whitehead's first flight. [man] &quot;In 1901, he made a flight &quot;He has demonstrated &quot;Mr. Whitehead made Since that time, two more flights Here's a very recent find. It's the front page of the Bridgeport Evening Post. This article appears to be a description and confirms in another newspaper that Whitehead successfully flew in the West End of Bridgeport. [narrator] Brown has discovered published around the world But 40 years after the event, had its effect and helped to side-line who threatened [fanfare plays] [newsreader] In Washington, [narrator] In 1948, of the US government as the world's first aviators. Since then, the Wright brothers' of the Smithsonian's [Goldstone] The Wright brothers' But if Gustave Whitehead achieved he should be recognized for that and he should be recognized by America's [narrator] In 2013, as the first to achieve powered flight and the world's oldest aviation journal, So why won't the Smithsonian as a serious contender What the world didn't know is the Smithsonian entered into Revealed only because of a Freedom the contract stipulates that the museum that any other aircraft flew This contract dictates what version and it actually specifies is never allowed to say that somebody else I think it's unfortunate that a great would be contractually bound [narrator] So long as the Smithsonian a major drawcard to the museum, So how did this contract come into being? For 40 years, the Smithsonian built by its former secretary, as the first capable of flying. But following relentless pressure the Smithsonian finally caved in Well, I'm not a lawyer, I'm an historian, what I see, um... is sort of an important monument uh, having nothing to do with but having to do with those years was, in fact, not playing fair [narrator] So will the Institution paving the way for a truly independent Whether the Smithsonian were ever to but if it was my decision, [Goldstone] If the price of telling to me, a museum tells the truth. -Release! [narrator] Whatever the final judgement his recorded words were prophetic. [man as Gustave] I have no doubt as common as automobiles And before you and I are old men, there will be more travelling through [narrator] But back in 1902, Whitehead needed money Unlike the Wright brothers, An investor called in the loan. Markopf! This is my shop! [narrator] Locked out of his workshop, By the time Stella Randolph on the lost flights of Gustave Whitehead, the German aviator had disappeared He spent the later years of his life In 1927, Whitehead died and was buried And so we are left with the story When they first flew we have believed their version of history, that the Wright brothers flew first Today, the standing of the Wrights handed down through generations... ...achieved by dauntless resolution [narrator] ...and protected by the Smithsonian secretary on behalf If somebody ever came up that someone had flown [Brown] Seven separate flights in contemporary newspapers and magazines, predating the Wright's We have the 17 witness This is way beyond a shadow of a doubt. The current history of aviation [narrator] Who flew first? Eighty years after the battle lines remain clearly drawn At stake is the truth credit where credit is due.
