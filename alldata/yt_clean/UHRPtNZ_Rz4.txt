hello everyone in today's lecture we will see the subnetting as usual let's start the session with our outcomes upon the completion of the session the learner will be able to outcome number one we will understand subnetting and outcome number two we will know the procedure to subnet a network let's start with the class full addressing we know there are five classes of ipv4 addresses class a b c d and e and we know class a b and c are for our purpose for example if we want to create two networks and we want 10 computers in each network obviously we need to go for class c and we know class c we can have a maximum of 254 usable hosts or usable ip addresses but our requirement is just 10 for one network so class full addressing obviously weighs ip addresses and that's why we are migrating from class full world to classless world and classless addressing is possible with the help of subnetting let's see subnetting what is this subnetting a sub network or subnet is a logical subdivision of an ip network for example if we have an ip network and we are going to create a logical subdivision of the network say how many computers should belong to this network how many computers should belong to the other network and these kind of logical subdivisions are created using the subnetting concept and the practice of dividing a network into two or more networks is called subnetting computers that belong to a subnet are addressed with an identical most significant bit group in the ip addresses how does the computer come to know whether the computers are belonging to its own network or other network it is decided based on the most significant bit i will explain about this third point when we see some examples using subnetting for time being we must understand that in a subnet all computers are addressed with the help of the most significant bits let's see an example for subnetting say this is a classy network without subnetting this is a class cip address because it's starting with 192. if the first octet in an ip address is between 192 and 223 it is obviously class c network so in this example we don't have any subnetting say this is the network address 192.168.14.0 and we know what will be the default subnet mask for classy it is 255.255.255. or when we use 255.255.255.0 with this ip address then the first address represents this whole network and the last address that is 192.168.14.255 is the broadcast address except this 0 and 255 other ip addresses can be assigned to the hosts this is a classy network without submitting let's see the same classy network with two sub networks say here is the network address that we had in the previous example but i am not going to use this as a single network like in the previous case here i am going to create two logical networks say this is 14.0 this is like the previous network but what i am going to do is that with this ip address i am going to create two logical networks say how many ip addresses are possible a maximum of 256 ip addresses are possible in this network right so what i am going gonna do is i'm gonna break this 256 into two equal halves that is 128 ip addresses in one network and 128 ip addresses in the other network say i'm gonna create two sub networks this is sub network one and this is sub network 2. the network address of this sub network will be 192.168.14.0 and the network address of the second sub network will be 192.168.14.128. so from 0 to 127 will be in this network and from 128 to 255 will be in this network why we are not able to use 127 because in any sub network the first ip address represents the network address and the last ip address represents the broadcast address so in the first subnet the ip address 192.168.14.127 represents the broadcast address whereas in the next sub network the ip address 192.168.14.120 this is the starting ap address of this subnet and this represents the network address and the last ip address that is 192.168.14.255 represents the broadcast address and what about the subnet mask here will it be 255.255.255.0 if it is 255.255.255.0 then we don't have any two logical sub networks it means everything will be in the same network why because the default subnet mask of class c is 255.255.255.0 it says that the first three octet should match so in this example the first three octets are matching so all the hosts in this scenario will be in the same network but we are going to create a logical network or a sub network so the subnet mask will not be definitely 255.255.255.0 rather it will be a different subnet mask and this subnet mask only says whether computers belonging to the same network or different network so with the new subnet mask that we are going to create that will say these computers are in one network and if this computer let's say the computer with the ip address 192.168.14.1 wants to communicate with the computer with the ip address 192.168.14.129 so they can't do the communication with the help of a switch because this 129 is not belonging to its own network the subnet mask says that it is not belonging to its own network so using a router only this communication is possible with the help of a switch computers belonging to this cub network can communicate with the help of switch the computers belonging to this sub network can communicate with each other or communicate among themselves but if these two sub networks want to communicate with each other then they need a router to do this so this is what the logical partition of a sub network how we are going to do this submitting basically the submitting involves five steps step number one we need to identify the class of the ip address that we are going to submit and we need to note the default subnet mask once the default subnet mask is noted we are going to step number 2 to convert the default subnet mask into binary once we convert this into binary we will note the number of hosts that are required per subnet for example in the previous case we require 128 hosts per subnet and we need to find the subnet generator and the octet position no worries i will be explaining about these things with an example in the next lecture but for time being we will just note what are these five steps and step number four we need to generate the new subnet mask because if we go with the existing or the default subnet mask we can't say what is the logical partition but once we create the new subnet mask we will be able to say whether computers belonging to its own network or different network and finally using the subnet generator that is what we have seen in step number three we are going to create the network ranges we call these network ranges as the subnets and this submits in the appropriate octet position these are the five steps we are going to adopt in order to solve the subnetting problems let's take another example so that we will be having a better understanding about the subnetting we have two devices let's say one device is assigned with ip address 10 or 10.10.1 and the other device is having the ip address 10.10.10.9 when we have these two ip addresses with this subnet mask whether it is 255 or 255.255.0 or 255.255.0.0 or even 255.0.0.0 these two devices will be belonging to the same network why because all the subnet must say if we take a class a subnet mask it says anything that starts with 10 will be in the same network if we take class b it will say anything that starts with 10 or 10 will be in the same network so in this example both are matching if we use class c subnet mask it says anything that starts with 10 or 10.10 will be belonging to the same network so in this example both these devices are belonging to the same network instead of these class a b or c subnet mask if we use another subnet mask which is 255.255.255.248 then these two computers are not belonging to the same network so they do actually belong to a different network it means if we use these two ip addresses with any of these subnet mask switches enough to establish communication among these two devices if we use these two ip addresses with this subnet mask then switch cannot establish a communication among these two devices because they are actually belonging to different networks because the subnet mask says it's 248 the last octet says it's 248 i know it will be difficult for you to understand at this stage but definitely we'll be exploring these things in the upcoming lectures with examples at the time it will be more clear for you to understand in this example a switch is enough in order to make a communication with this class a b or c subnet mask but with this subnet mask these two devices cannot communicate with each other they need a router because a router can connect two or more different networks i hope now you understood subnetting and we know the procedure to subnet a network in this lecture we have just seen the procedure to submit a network in the next lecture we will see an example i hope you guys enjoyed this lecture and thank you for watching [Applause] [Music] you
