CONCEIVABLE GIVEN THE GLOBAL &gt;&gt; I WOULD SAY THAT THE COME LIKELY THAT THIS CONFLICT WILL AND THAT PHASE MAY WELL INVOLVE KIND OF CEASE-FIRE THAT IS THE SETTLEMENT. SCENARIO, PEACE PROCESSES TEND SO I THINK THERE IS NOBODY THAT DONALD TRUMP WOULD END THE SAID. AND MAKING IT MORE LIKELY THAT TO AT LEAST LOOK AT THE THE QUESTION IS WHETHER IT WILL THAT WOULD DEPEND ON EUROPEAN WILLINGNESS TO GUARANTEE ANY SUBSEQUENT PEACE AGREEMENT. &gt;&gt; WHEN IT COMES TO A WAS IN BRUSSELS LAST WEEKEND A OF A POTENTIAL CEASE-FIRE BUT INCLUDING CESSATION OF MORE CHECKS ON NUCLEAR MISSILES RUSSIA. IN THOSE NEGOTIATIONS, HOW MUCH UNDERPLAYED? &gt;&gt; I THINK FROM A DISTANCE IT AN ISSUE OF FINDING A BUT THE CONCERNS OF UKRAINE ARE FEAR IS NOT ONLY ABOUT GIVING FEAR IS THAT IF RUSSIA BELIEVES THROUGH FORESTS, IT MIGHT COME VLADIMIR PUTIN MADE IT CLEAR ON FUNDAMENTALLY HE DOES NOT INDEPENDENT AND SOVEREIGN HE SEES IT AS A HISTORICAL PART THAT DOES NOT MEAN HE HAS THE THINK LIKE MANY LEADERS HE WENT THINKING IT WOULD BE A SHORT FORCES WOULD TAKE OVER KYIV. CONTINUES TO BE THE FEAR FROM ONLY PAUSE THE CONFLICT. SECURITY GUARANTEES ARE REALLY AGREEMENT. AGREEMENT IS RESPECTED AND YEARS DOWN THE LINE? STILL WOULD LIKE TO HAVE AT KYIV. THAT UKRAINE WILL BE TEMPTED TO TERRITORY. ENFORCEMENT ARE IMPORTANT BUT RUSSIA IS CONCERNED, IT IS HARD CREDIBLY GUARANTEE IT IN THE SMALLER CONFLICT. &gt;&gt; IN THE SCENARIO OF A ON THE TABLE, TALK TO US ABOUT THE NARRATIVE LAST WEEK WAS INCREASING.
