Hello friends welcome to this new video tutorial in this video tutorial we will discuss about displaying multiple plots on waveform graph so let's get started now when we are going to display multiple plots on waveform graphs then we have to give the input to the waveform graph in the form of 2D array of values where each row of the array is interpreted as a single plot by the waveform graph so the waveform graph interprets the row data as the Y data points on the graph for that particular plot the number of rows represents the number of plots on the waveform graph which will be plotted simultaneously on the same waveform graph the X index starts at x equal to 0 and increments by itself by one till all the array values for the various rows are plotted to the corresponding X indexes so let's practically see on the program so here is the program to show the three plots on the waveform graphs will be which will be plotted simultaneously so I'm generating three data random data uh first is this Loop which is generating the random data the second is this Loop which is generating the random data and third is this Loop which is generating the random data so this is plot one data which is an array this is plot two data which is also an array and plot three data which is also an array all these three arrays are 1D arrays generating 10 values of random data and these three arrays 1D arrays are um are built together or combined together to form a 2d array using a build array function so here that is 2D array of the corresponding uh um combined data of 1D arrays and this 2D data is fed to waveform graph and waveform graph plots each row as a single plot so first row would be plotting this data the second row would be plotting this data the third row will be plotting this data so let's see so when I run the program I'm going to run the program program so see there are three different plots plotted so this is plot one plot two plot 3 actually plot 0er is plot one plot one is plot two and plot two is plot three because the plotting starts from zero so let's rename them as plot one this is plot two and this is plot three so let's figure out now this was the first data generated uh first array generated and this was this is the first array this is the second array and this is the third array which is 1D data all the 1D datas are generated to be plotted on the waveform graph now we have to plot them simultaneous ly on the waveform graph so have we have used the build array function to build a 2d array out of the 1D arrays so here we have a 2d array now what is this first row this first row is actually plot one data the second row is plot two data the third row is plot three data now first row is plotted as plot one data so let's verify so first uh first row is plotted by white so we have 5.2 so this is 5.2 correct um this is approximately 3.99 correct then 7.5 this is also correct then we have 9.4 this is also correct then we have 7.2 this is also correct then we have 2.69 this is 2.69 and we have 7.51 we have 7.51 over here uh yes over here we have 7.51 then we have 7.75 we have here and 1.61 is here and 6.59 is here so let's um uh create um cursor Legend So we add cursors for the various plots create cursor single plot so we have cursor for we have cursor let's so this is three then it is I think we have to create a multiple cursor delete cursor create cursor multiplot cursor snap to all plots okay so when I move I don't have the values watch all plots so here I have the values so when I'm having the zero values we are here then we are having one values plot one we have this 5.2 correct plot 2 we have 3.19 which is correct then plot three we have 17.45 which is correct then next values 3.99 correct 11.87 3 correct and 28355 which is correct then I have plot 1 7.5 correct 10.65 correct 19. 7173 correct so we can verify various values like this we have we are going to verify so this is approximately 7.5 which is correct and then plot two value is 10.65 over here this is correct and the third value is 19 7175 so this green plot is actually this plot these values all these values are the green plot and these values are the red plots over here and these values are the white plots and we can verify all the values from the graph so this is the way how multiple plots are simultaneously plotted on the waveform graph so this has to be kept in mind that each row will represent a single plot so whenever we are going to plot it we are going to build the array from 1D arrays so that brings us to the end of the video thanks for watching this video and stay connected for more videos coming soon on this series
