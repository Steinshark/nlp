All of this started on [October 31st, 2008 with the] with the publication of a piece of software by an 'Satoshi Nakamoto.' They proposed a system of electronic cash, but with A system that is decentralized, A system [with] certain mathematical properties meaning you can have something that It cannot be copied, which seems like an antithesis. The quintessential characteristic of digital you can create infinite copies of it at almost zero cost. But you can't create infinite This idea of having a digital thing that is rare and cannot [which has] not happened before [in computer science]. A decentralized peer-to-peer network that [relies on] If I make a transaction, everyone who is checking every aspect of my transaction. [It is] an open system for securing and no one can spend the same [outputs] twice, solving a as the Byzantine Generals' Problem. The basic idea is: how do you know If I give it to one merchant, what stops me from taking and giving it to another merchant? Until the invention of Bitcoin, there was only one suitable When that central authority sees the first transaction, That works, it is very efficient. Visa does it. If you buy something for $10 in one shop and buy something else for $10, they will make sure They won't let you spend the same money twice, or more than your credit allows. That's great. Those systems work. They are efficient and can do But there is one problem: you are trusting that You are not just putting trust in that company With that trust comes enormous power: the power to refuse to give you an account; this economic activity; the power to demand that you That is something which is different from I can use cash without showing papers, I don't have an intermediary, pay [them] a I can just transact directly, person-to-person. When you introduce this third-party company, you have a I want to give one of you $10. Who in this crowd Can anyone take a Visa card from me? Who accepts Visa here? No one, not a single person. Because [that system is not] about people to pay companies to maybe pay people. Bitcoin is peer-to-peer. Our financial systems have become peer-to- Everybody takes a little cut, everybody They take great advantage of that. What is the end result? Billions of people billions of people who will Many of them don't have [identity documentation], literacy and numeracy, to walk into a bank. Or they &quot;look wrong,&quot; because they are The untouchables can't walk into a bank; they will be This happens all across the world, a direct result Bitcoin is different. It allows us By the end of today, everyone in this room will be able with software running on their smartphone. At that point, I can pay you or you can pay me. as a community, without involving any third-party Without the requirement to present [identity documents], You fulfill human-worthiness. You don't need to be human; autonomous software can The invention [of Bitcoin] in 2009 It is not just a weird form of PayPal. Bitcoin takes an obscure branch of mathematics called [which] is then applied to the domain of establishing without giving any one [entity] control over the system. This unique property is what makes Bitcoin special. You can send money to someone else without knowing You can trust that the mathematical rules in the unforgeable, and spendable (as soon as it clears You don't need to know the person who gave it And yet we do it every day with cash. If I tip my taxi driver with a 2,000 rupee note, Do they need to 'process a transaction'? Cash is a representation of value. [To] verify that it is [not a fake], the person who receives They can [usually] do that on their own, they don't [need] to call someone and You don't need to check with You can verify with your own eyes that it is real money. If you receive a bitcoin transaction, the [node] software without asking anyone else. [If that is the case], the identity of the The value is there. You don't need to trust them. That is revolutionary in a way we've seen once before at Many people who [grew] up with the internet still They look at the internet and see it as a [platform But we had publishing [platforms] before the internet, We had ways to disseminate What was different about the internet? For the first time ever, it enabled a global free flow to anyone who had the technical capability to connect. As long as you have the technical capability, whether you are a human or a software agent. [It doesn't care] what race, religion, or gender you are. [You have] the power of the free flow That is the magic of the internet, the transformative To many people, this idea is terrifying, that anyone can Without control, without a license, qualification, diploma, [To many, this is] terrifying. For my generation and generations that follow, It is the way things have always been Bitcoin creates the exact same circumstances, It enables the free flow of money, the free simply through their choice to participate The free flow of money, the free flow of value, It is not an investment scheme. It is not just a It adds the free flow of money to the other I guarantee you this is a terrifying idea to many without asking for permission [from an intermediary], My generation finds it liberating. They will never know a world in which you a world in which money only works a world in which the privilege of having for other people to store your money; a world in which some destinations are prohibited; a world in which, in order to open a bank account, [These will] seem like bizarre ideas. Get ready for I've met them. They love the fact that Parents will find that terrifying, Ten years [later], they will walk into a bank because They will have a conversation with a banker, which will In order to open an account, they need to present a process that will take an hour. Afterwards, they have limited access for a high fee, only [This] account can only use one currency and only send An account they can't use to send money to their They will look at that and say, &quot;My grandparents &quot;It is almost as bizarre as when they asked me to send This [is happening]. The people who are afraid of We live in a new world. There are two ways we can adjust: pretend it is not We now live in a world where you can send value We can embrace that or pretend it's not happening. In my previous talk, I used an analogy If you turn on the [weather channel] and the weatherman but that doesn't suit your plans because [there is an If you're powerful, maybe you can complain to the news [But no matter what you do], Governments are looking at Bitcoin and the &quot;How do we control it? How do &quot;How do we enforce our authority, our legal purview?&quot; They ask questions like, &quot;Who is in charge? [Laughter] No one controls this. No one is in charge. Or you can go for the more sophisticated approach: &quot;Well, it's based on an open-access model, with based on game theoretical outcomes that ensure without anybody having the ability to cheat, based on mathematical rules and strong cryptography.&quot; [Applause] To which they respond, &quot;Yes, yes... I've had people come up to me after meetings [Laughter] &quot;Who is in charge?&quot; They think I'm It [does seem] bizarre to say, &quot;Here is a system &quot;A system without hierarchy, without control.&quot; Why? Because we've never had any of those things [before]. Every system of trust we've ever had in our a 19th-century hierarchical organisation a bureaucracy based on internal [There is always] ultimate authority vested in someone Maybe it's hereditary, maybe it's dictatorial, but you You just let your eyes follow to the top, In some cases, that person is [merely] an actor, with but nevertheless authority is vested in that person. Then you look at Bitcoin, and it is a flat system. You [wonder], &quot;Maybe those people are in control. Then you noticed that these people alone can't The funny thing is, when people look at Bitcoin, which is [a common reaction to] new technology. They look at Bitcoin and say, &quot;The miners and developers Why doesn't one of the groups just say, &quot;This is [No one has] that ability. It is a system of We are in deadlock because consensus overrides They look at Bitcoin and say, &quot;You keep squabbling, That is a feature, not a bug. They look at Bitcoin and say, &quot;But you can't reverse &quot;How can you do that? What if something goes wrong? Bitcoin guarantees the execution If you put the script that says, &quot;Here is one bitcoin. That is the script [which will] be irreversible It is not a very good script [in this case], There is no one who can make that bitcoin come back That is one form of irreversible promise. Of course, I can say, &quot;Here is one bitcoin. It is currently locked &quot;After thirty days, if there is no dispute, it will by a trustworthy third-party who I have chosen.&quot; I can introduce third parties if I want to, I can introduce reversibility if I want to, but I can choose who my escrow agent is; I can [still utilize] the feature of irreversibility, but I can soften that promise to apply consumer It is a feature, not a bug. Bitcoin is this strange being, it really is. It forces us to consider whether we actually Do you remember when you were in school and No? You neither? We didn't do it either. You would think that one of the one of the resounding artefacts of human civilization -- would be an important topic at school. Not one day. Maybe, in some places, you did that gave you this vague idea about money Most of us cannot hold a fifteen-minute The six-year-old has good questions and we [usually] Well, the correct answer is: I think it has something to do with the through the International Monetary Fund [where currencies] compete through trade of inflation-adjusted exchange rates. These can be used to create local debt issued printed by the central bank, then distributed partial reserve leverage at approximately This creates either inflationary or deflationary effects, through the exchange of an abstract token but is depreciated by the rate of inflation [Applause] &quot;So why can't we have more of it, Mommy? That conversation doesn't go that way. Usually, &quot;Clean your room.&quot; &quot;One day, you'll understand.&quot; And that is the first lie, because If you ask the average person on the street, They have a theory, a fairytale, a story which is about delivered in bundles dropped through the chimney. [The story] is about as solid as Santa Claus. What gives money value? It says right there, on &quot;By the full faith and credit of the Royal Bank of India.&quot; It says, &quot;one note applies to all debt, public and But most people have no idea how that works. I guarantee that if you ask the average person the is because there is a cave, vault, or box in direct proportion to the money that circulates. This has not been true since Yet that is the Santa Claus Or they believe the government guarantees [raises] other interesting questions: why does inflation Did the government not try hard enough to guarantee it? That is the inconvenient truth at the core of We don't understand it. We simply don't. You are participating in a shared hallucination in which you firmly believe that this that if you go to the store and present someone will give eggs, chicken, spices, Something for this colored piece of paper. It takes an incredible hallucination for us to believe It [can be] pretty, but it is not pretty at that level. Nobody gives you products or services That shared hallucination took hundreds of years with the introduction of paper money, gold certificates, [These were just] pieces of paper that could be In the most amazing magical trick, they switched What? This was supposed to be redeemable for Nope, not anymore. It is just a piece of paper. What gives it value is your belief that, if you go The moment that belief suffers a crack, Imagine some crazy scenario where the promise of As of four hours from now, these two I mean, that couldn't possibly happen... [Laughter] Here is the interesting [part]: if the value was and the people who gave that promise now what is the value of that piece of paper? Zero, right? But that is not what happened at all. For months after that announcement, the paper was Even though [they] told you it was [worth nothing], in one of the many locations where &quot;corruption no longer You know that story, unless of course you are connected It still only depreciated by 20%. I bet you I bet they still don't have a value of zero. In fact, we rarely find [the value of any] I can go to Rome in Italy and [buy] silver coins [they] have not been in circulation for almost one In fact, their value exceeds their worth in silver. Your money did not go to zero because its value That illusion was shaken, but not destroyed. You panicked at first, thinking, &quot;This has zero value!&quot; Then someone says to you, &quot;Don't worry, I know this guy Now it has just depreciated [in value]. You give it value through your use; In order for that promise to hold, It [must] be unforgeable; if it can be forged, known in economics as Gresham's Law, If you get your hands on the &quot;good&quot; money, you Sound familiar? It happened here. If you have an old note and a new note, until you are rid of all the old notes. The new notes disappear from circulation, their If they trade the old note, then it is [still] in circulation. The longer it remains in circulation, the longer Gresham's Law in action. I did not believe Thank you, India, for validating my economics professor [The experiment] sucked [and was very] painful, Money [must] be unforgeable and portable. I'm sure [the conference organisers The reason you don't pay with gold It sucks as money is because, for the value that You can't make it lighter, its density is fixed. At the moment, other currencies have a similar situation. To buy a cup of coffee, you need a wheelbarrow of cash. &quot;Aren't you worried someone will steal your money?&quot; They said, &quot;No, I'm worried someone will steal my Bad money chases good money out. [Good money must] be unforgeable, You [should] be able to validate, independently It [must be usable] as a unit of account; you need One of the reasons barter is not working, at any scale more than the extremely local, Yes, I can give you a chicken for a goat. I can give the water-carrier a chicken for litres of water. But now I [would need] to track the exchange rates Meanwhile, the hairdresser has to track the price of [and probably] accounting services, etc. We [would need[ to track every price exchange rate for The whole point of money is that you only [which] has no value [in itself because] you It is not the value, it is the token of value, It [must] be unforgeable, portable, Then come the difficult [characteristics]. It [must] be Yet [groups of] people [who lived] in the From archaeological dig sites, we find that never [if they were] on a beach, always in On the beach, they used crystals, quartz, and minerals, As long as [a lot of it] doesn't exist [And there lies] one of the big problems I have bad news for you: the rupee is not rare. just like the dollar, the euro, the yen, Worse, the power to decide how much to create is If you are a debtor, then you want the money If you are a saver, you want the money to be worth If you give the government -- the biggest debtor of all they will print money [to infinity] in order to In this process, they transfer In a culture of savers, that [would be] a terrifying thought and [use a few] little nifty tricks. We tell people, &quot;The a rate of inflation will not What is 2%? I don't even know [how much that] is. I was never good at division. [What would] 2.2% do? If you tell people &quot;Eh, two percent, five percent, ten percent... Let's rephrase it: in ten years, [about 25% of the value of] [Laughter] &quot;I save [money] like crazy, I work two jobs, &quot;Where does it go? Who took it from me? &quot;Oh my god, [a quarter of] my money in ten years?!&quot; Inflation took your money. More accurately, the government, corporations, and banks For them, the money they owe is also worth That is where we see a fundamental difference Bitcoin is money. Bitcoin is a store of value, a medium It gradually acquires these characteristics as it grows As more people participate in the exchange of that economy creates value, that value and the reduced volatility makes it more suitable It makes it better as a store of value. [meaning each] unit gets transferred Eventually, the value stabilises to a point Where you can say, &quot;A talk is worth half a bitcoin. I can't do that today because it is still too volatile, One day, I will price my bitcoin in [satoshis]. The correct answer is: one thousand millibits. There will come a day when the question but &quot;how much bitcoin is a rupee worth,&quot; That is when you [will] know things have changed. There is something special about a global currency. Here is the magic: twenty-one million [coins] There are not any currencies which can do that. There is only one thing in the world which shares the supply that [becomes harder Except you can't email gold. You can email bitcoin. Suddenly, you notice [Bitcoin] may have a bigger People will point at it and say, But the market will give it a [price], You can use currency controls, propaganda, lies, They point at Bitcoin and say, But anybody who is involved in Bitcoin points right &quot;Oh no, yours is the fake money. This shit is real, &quot;Delivered to Colombia and smuggled across Fake money can be resolved by the market. We are [still] at the very beginning [of Bitcoin]. This is not This is a technology which has radical, For the first time in human history, it creates anywhere, at any time, without restriction, That technology [will] be difficult to use. The internet used to go down Some of the companies [currently] in this that also happened with the internet. In 2000, [about] 90% of the companies were But the internet didn't go anywhere, it just found That will happen in [cryptocurrencies] too. We may change the name, we may change We will certainly change the technology [in various It will be a fundamental part of the future of humanity. because it already did. Thank you. [Applause]
