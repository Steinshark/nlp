[light piano music] You've probably heard the old adage, &quot;Boys don't cry&quot; That sentiment has been floating around in our culture for a very long time. It's a curious phrase though, isn't it? When we hear someone say &quot;Boys don't cry&quot;, we know it isn't meant literally. That is, we know that boys, and by extension men, do, in fact, cry. We see it all the time. Both in real life - and at the movies. Even tough guy characters cry, So, what does that phrase really mean? Well, &quot;boys don't cry&quot; is an assertion of a cultural ideal for manhood. Spencer: &quot;Don't cry, don't cry, What most people mean is closer to, &quot;Boys aren't supposed to cry.&quot; Daniel Plainview: &quot;Stop crying, But even that isn't entirely accurate. Because there are a few situations where Ron Swanson: &quot;Crying, acceptable at So, the more accurate statement would be, &quot;Boys aren't supposed to cry, except under It doesn't really have the same ring Romeo: (crying) &quot;I defy you stars!&quot; But it's that narrow set of circumstances in this video. Because those moments of vulnerability, the construction of masculinity. Now, I wanna be clear that the inclusion does not necessarily equal In many of the examples we'll be looking Some of the scenes are incredibly and the actors' performances Roy: &quot;Like... tears... in rain.&quot; As with most of my video essays, examining over-arching media patterns, and looking at how those patterns help Darcy: &quot;Woah.&quot; Lloyd: &quot;I feel like crying.&quot; Of course, all men aren't painted Chiron: &quot;Shit, I cry so much sometimes, I Since they haven't yet entered into given more emotional leeway on screen. Earl: &quot;It's enough to make a but not this man. Get back in there, tear.&quot; [pop] And because of hyper-masculine stereotypes the allowable window for vulnerability than it is for white heroes. Eric: &quot;Just sick of everyone Gay men in media, meanwhile, tend to more emotionally expressive Even though we all understand that men and boys do cry, there's still an unwritten rule that men are only allowed to openly in a small handful of social situations. Think of it like an emotional window, wherein men can display without jeopardizing their manhood status. The more extreme the situation, the more unrestrained the crying can be. So for instance, if a male character audiences have learned this means whatever is going on, it must be really, really unthinkably bad - like never-going-to-see-his-family-again or just-killed-a-whole-bunch-of-people Anakin: &quot;I killed them.&quot; or did-cannibalism bad. Patrick: &quot;I ate some of their brains.&quot; Curtis: &quot;I know what people taste like.&quot; Frank: &quot;Soylent Green is made Now, admittedly, Soylent Green is on the far end of the spectrum. The most common set of circumstances, where the crying window involve death. Usually, the death of a loved one. Forrest: &quot;And I miss you, Jenny.&quot; Especially if they have been victimized [sob] This can include tears relating to an impending death, or a breakdown immediately following a near-death experience. War, in particular, is often represented as a setting that provides access to those extreme situations, when it's socially permissible to be but at a tragic cost. It's also sometimes permissible for men to shed tears relating to Alfred: &quot;You trusted me... Though it has to be a great failure, like the failure to provide or protect. Occasionally, that can include the but more often it's the failure to stop a catastrophe. The crying window also opens briefly in another social arena. Jimmy: &quot;There's no crying - [woman sobbing] Tom Hanks is a funny man, but he is wrong in that scene - there IS crying in baseball And in other men's sports. Rocky: &quot;This is the greatest night But notice it's only around particularly heightened moments of competition - like the final game of the season, or qualifying for the playoffs. These intense situations may be the only time all year where a grown man gets to cry in public and not be ridiculed for it. Data: &quot;I am happy to see Spot - Tears of joy are probably the rarest acceptable type for men in media. These are restricted to post-traumatic reunions, recognition for a life's work, the birth of a child, or a father at his daughters wedding. Though, tellingly, very rarely at his own wedding - or the wedding of a son. [man sobbing] There are a few other fringe cases where the crying window opens. But notice that all of these situations Simon: &quot;Hey, stop crying&quot; - Dad: &quot;I'm trying, (rushed) I'm trying&quot; So rare that they may only come around a few times in a man's entire life. On average we do see men crying slightly more often in dramas or romance stories. [thuds] But in order for men to cry in action-driven media, an almost supernatural level of trauma is usually required. Even when it's a tragic or the flow of tears can still be noticeably constrained for male We're all familiar with the One solitary drop of emotion is allowed to to let the audience know that he harbors feelings that will likely remain unspoken. But often we don't even get the we just see damp, wet eyes and the tears aren't allowed to escape. On many occasions, I found myself having to pause and zoom in on a still frame to try to figure out if the guy was really shedding tears or not. Ronny: &quot;Are you crying? - Zip: &quot;No.&quot; The reason why we're spending so much time talking about men's vulnerability is because tears are healthy - both physiologically and emotionally. On a biological level, and helps reduce anxiety. On a social level, the ability to cry and be openly vulnerable in front of others, is critical for human connection and Jerry: &quot;You ... complete me.&quot; It's difficult to built and maintain emotionally supportive friendships Rebbeca: &quot;There we go... there we go.&quot; Ted: &quot;I promise you there is something worse out there than being sad, and that is being alone and being sad.&quot; With that in mind, it's instructive to consider the wide array of social situations that fall outside of the permissible crying window. Leonard: &quot;So it's cool if I cry Penny: &quot;Yeah, I probably wouldn't.&quot; Men may fear losing masculinity points - John: &quot;You're not gonna cry, are you?&quot; - if they are seen crying due to things Jack: &quot;No, I'm fine&quot; - fear, heartbreak, pressure at work, experiencing depression or anxiety, embarrassment or hurt feelings. George: &quot;As a man, you are crying Ira: &quot;I'm not crying.&quot; George: &quot;People are gonna think we just stop doing what you're doing.&quot; Crying is also frowned upon for men when doing things like watching a sappy movie or witnessing a beautiful sunset or even connecting on an intimate level. Rachel: &quot;Are you crying?&quot; - Peter: &quot;I'm so sorry that I'm being Notice that all of these life events are relatively common. They're the kind of things that are likely to happen to men in their everyday lives. If we do see men crying for one of those everyday reasons it feels so remarkable, Stan: &quot;Check the, uh, check the Like all social constructs, the rules governing the crying window can be bent from time to time. But if the rules are broken, the guy runs the risk of becoming the objects of ridicule amongst his peers or worse being turned into a meme on the internet. As should be evident by some of the clips we've just been looking at, when men are depicted getting emotional outside of the permissible window, their tears are routinely played for comedy. Ron: &quot;I'm in a glass case of emotion&quot; This is the space Will Ferrell, Adam Sandler and other comedic actors build their pathetic male characters in. Henry: &quot;Why would you do this to me, [Alan wailing] It's a world where men who cry too long, too intensely or at inconvenient times are mocked - mercilessly. Dylan: &quot;I thought big people weren't Megan: &quot;I think it's sweet that he's Sara: &quot;Megan!&quot; Comedy that makes fun of men for crying consistently frames outbursts of emotion or vulnerability as pathetic, weak - Raj: &quot;Oh my god, I'm crying already.&quot; - and decidedly unmanly. Woman: &quot;Why don't you just put on a dress The association of tears with femininity is explicitly illustrated in the countless jokes deriding men for crying like a little girl. [laugh track] Monica: &quot;Still crying?&quot; Rachel: &quot;Like a little girl.&quot; Skinner: &quot;Right now superintendent crying like a little girl.&quot; [laughing] Jeremy: &quot;Stop crying John: &quot;I wasn't crying like a little girl.&quot; The insult is used to police men's expression of emotion while also reinforcing the sexist idea that women are somehow overly emotional or lack self-control. David: &quot;You know women. They get Ian: &quot;Yeah, David, you seem emotional.&quot; David: &quot;Yeah, I'm kinda having Even though crying is a basic human response for everyone, regardless of their gender, it has come to be thought of as a gendered phenomenon. Paul: &quot;I cried for 45 minutes. You slap Vito: &quot;You can act like a man, what's the matter with you?&quot; Charlotte: &quot;Oh, you can cry, it's okay.&quot; Emerson: &quot;It is not okay for with a bunch of happy families This is why the social pressure for men to put on a brave face and not cry in the Emerson: &quot;If you can't hold it, you take and cry in private on the toilet, As therapist Terrance Real has noted, [quote on screen] If men do get emotional in media, notice where and when they do it. Most of the time, vulnerable moments only It's a classic bit of cinematic because we, as the audience, get to see of true vulnerability. But they rarely share those feelings Since the expression of vulnerability is so strongly coded feminine, stories often have women acting as conduits for men's feelings. The emotional labor of caring for typically falls on the women And, more often than not, that support One of the consequences of living in a where men are taught to is that they don't want to be around other people who are crying. Jerry: &quot;What are you doing, George: &quot;No!&quot; Jerry: &quot;Just get yourself together. I don't know if I can be friends with you George: &quot;Oh, shut up!&quot; Men may be unwilling to take care of or provide emotional support to those Oscar: &quot;There, there&quot; - because that close proximity undermines their own sense of masculinity. When in the vicinity of another man Vic: &quot;Oh come on, you need a tissue? You got a blankie in the trunk, They might pat their friend on the back - Tony: &quot;Hey, let's stop hugging.&quot; - or give a quick hug before Cliff: &quot;Woah, woah, hey&quot; Rick: &quot;I'm sorry about that... Cliff: &quot;Here put these on. In fact, if caught shedding tears, male characters will frequently deny it Schmidt: &quot;Are you crying?&quot; Nick: &quot;I'm not crying.&quot; and pretend everything is fine. Ken: &quot;Are you crying?&quot; David: &quot;What's that?&quot; Ken: &quot;Are you crying?&quot; David: &quot;Am I crying? No, I'm not crying. Raj: &quot;Are you crying?&quot; Howard: &quot;No, I have allergies.&quot; Rusty: &quot;You okay?&quot; Daniel: &quot;Yeah, no, I just Jules: &quot;Are you crying?&quot; Seth: &quot;No I just have something Variations on the classic quip &quot;I just are written to communicate to viewers that the character does indeed Davis: &quot;No, no! No, No, No, I wasn't crying, okay? There's a lot of Michaelangelo: &quot;Are you crying?&quot; while also giving him a measure Raphael: &quot;No Ding-Dong, just a little Popular media frequently reinforces Patton: &quot;Shut up!&quot; that men need to hide their feelings. Patton: &quot;Won't have a yellow bastard in front of these brave men who have been In the fantastic stories Hollywood tells, feeling and action are often presented as Private Hudson: &quot;This can't be happening, as if one precludes the other. Rocket: &quot;Are you crying?&quot; Thor: &quot;No... yes. I feel like I'm losing it.&quot; Rocket: &quot;Get it together!&quot; Movies tell us over and over again that if men allow themselves they will be rendered useless. Not only will their emotions paralyze [Troy groans] but the whole world may fall apart Kirk: &quot;Snap out of it. Start acting It's not true, of course. Crying does not preclude action. [dramatic music] But the myth that vulnerability is [lion wailing] and therefore incompatible with power is so corrosive and so strong [slap] that many men have come to believe they must kill their emotional sides Montrose: &quot;I cut out all the soft parts of (Montrose) Just to be a man.&quot; Emotional disconnection has other even Jimmy: &quot;And it's really starting to piss for her. My own little daughter The process of working through hurt or loss can be slow and painful, but it's also necessary for And yet when we do see men breaking down the moment passes quickly. That's because the permissible crying window only remains opens for a short time. Even when finding the dead bodies of his the tears come and go in the space of This means we very rarely see who are given the time to properly mourn. Jed: &quot;Don't cry! Hold it back. Let it turn to something else&quot; [crying] (Jed) Just let it turn to In fact, in countless pieces of media men's tears essentially function [shot] Sometimes the transformation from profound grief to extreme aggression even happens within the same scene. Far too often in media we don't see men we see them getting mad and then getting even. [shots fired] Narrator: &quot;He goes wild - blood drunk.&quot; [shots fired] In this way violent retribution is presented as a replacement for the normal grieving process. This pattern then encourages men to channel all of their feelings [screaming] and to use that aggression to express in nearly all situations. [screaming] Now anger isn't necessarily a When directed in constructive ways, it can be an appropriate response The problem is that since are in many ways the opposite of Rage and anger are almost universally seen as signs of strength for men. Whereas prolonged grief or sadness Or worse as a sign of instability. This helps explain why filmmakers will so often use men's tears as audio-visual shorthand for a descend Or a descend into evil Or both. In his book &quot;Cracking the Armour - Micheal Kaufmann observes that [quote on screen] It's illuminating to consider men's emotional pain is translated in Hollywood narratives. Howard: &quot;I'm so sad, I'm so fucked up.&quot; [screaming] Just like violence directed outward, violence directed inward is as an intrinsic, almost inevitable of men's emotional pain. Riggan: &quot;Bang.&quot; Rather than being critiques of disconnected or violent masculinity these depictions end up glamorizing or at least mythologizing and poetizing male characters who almost never figure out in a healthy way. So instead we are treated to images in lovingly realized, cinematic In her amazing book &quot;The Will to Change&quot; bell hooks notes popular culture very rarely presents us with alternative [quote on screen] Indeed, stories in which men break the and successfully work trough in transformative ways, are few and far between. [crying] Sean: &quot;It's not your fault.&quot; &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; is a rare film in which the protagonist chooses to [sobbing] and instead chooses to follow the more vulnerable path of emotional Joel makes a similar choice in when he decides to face his rather than erasing them. In Berry Jenkins &quot;Moonlight&quot;, Chiron also hardened by isolation and embrace the vulnerability of emotional intimacy. Representations like these are rightfully but such depictions are still and remain the exception rather than the rule. As I said earlier, it can be genuinely gutwrenching when media allows us to glimpse cracks Seeing a man finally, at long last, letting a tear slip, a lip tremble or, in the most extreme circumstances, can be quite moving. Even in scenes that are meant to be Kayla: &quot;Oh, dad, come on. Come on, Still, I think it's important to recognize that these rare moments are seen as so precisely because disconnection is still for men in our society. Perhaps we wouldn't be as moved by the small cracks in the dam if we got to see the free flow of tears Movies and TV shows are much more than They also present us with, what bell &quot;the art of the possible&quot;. Zuko: &quot;How can you forgive me so easily? Iroh: &quot;I was never angry with you. I was sad because I was afraid you lost And that's why it's critical for media to show us more than just the rare, We need to see men crying Men connecting emotionally with women and with each other. And ultimately, to see men healing as they embrace the full range of their We need the crying window always open. [emotional music] I hope you enjoyed this video.
