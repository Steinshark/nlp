I worked my whole life and this is what it comes down to? Some greedy person wanting his big chunk out of what little bit I had? [Host] to live in your home? One month. I don't know what I'm going to do. Hope that I don't wake up tomorrow? That's crossed my mind. One of the most important forms of affordable housing is under threat. They're called manufactured housing communities. You might know them as mobile home parks or trailer parks, and they often get a bad rap. But 22 million Americans call them home for a reason. [Resident] oasis of affordable housing in this country. [Sam] of America's housing market, often the last line of defense against homelessness. But over the last decade, these communities have become the target of a new kind of landlord. [News Anchor] are increasingly getting involved. Some of the biggest investors in America have moved into this industry. People living in a local mobile home park outraged over the sharp increase in lot rent. Rents were raised by nearly 60%. Their rent could increase by thousands of dollars a year. A group of mobile home residents are protesting their living conditions. [Resident] a superior predator and let 'em loose in a target-rich environment. This is actually a good day. Sometimes it's like mud. [County Prosecutor] of the safety and welfare of our local citizens. And this we will not allow. [Sam] become private equity's latest target? And what can be done to save one of the last forms of affordable housing in the country? [Resident] 50 years, maybe more. [Sam] outside of Lansing, Michigan. [Madalyn] a good park should be run, by the same couple for years and years and years. They were a little stern. Or she was a little stern. She was a lot stern, but nobody pulled any punches with her. [Sam] Madalyn owns her home, but pays monthly rent to the park owner for the land it sits on. [Madalyn] I looked at my money and my situation and I'm like, "Okay, great." I knew what the rent was. It was a third of my income. I don't live high on the hog. You know, I'm not going to Paris anytime soon. And then the conglomerate came in and offered, apparently, the owner money that he couldn't resist. I looked it up and I went, "Oh dear, I think we are in trouble." [Sam] bought Madalyn's community, and later sold to another firm. Since then, her monthly rent plus fees have jumped 50%. Instead of what I thought the rent was going to be, it's $200 more. I have nowhere to go. Just the other day, my daughter went with me to the food bank and I hadn't done that before. I haven't been poor. I worked for 45 years. There is no American dream anymore. All it is is survival. [Sam] institutional investors started to buy more manufactured housing than ever before. Between 2020 and 2021, they made nearly a quarter of all manufactured home purchases in the U.S. Today, 12 private equity firms own at least 1,200 parks nationwide, according to the Private Equity Stakeholder Project. In Michigan, private equity owns 1 in every 10 parks. There is an overall trend in our economy to identify who has the fewest choices and then squeeze them. [Sam] housing residents in Michigan. [Paul] they're not really particularly mobile. Wall Street investors, private equity firms, hedge funds kind of figured out that folks living in manufactured housing communities are trapped. They can't move. [Sam] to move one of these homes, and most people who live in them can't afford that. [Paul] that the average manufactured housing resident lives on about $35,000 a year, that's generally out of people's range. [Sam] they're uniquely vulnerable to predatory landlords, who can charge the highest rent residents can bear. [Paul] who runs something called Manufactured Housing University. Okay, we're now at her second park. We're getting out again. So, here we are. [Paul] something along the lines of, "Owning a mobile home park is like owning a Waffle House and having your customers chained to the booth." The big thing is, they can really tolerate rent increases really well. And it pretty much works throughout America because there's so much need for affordable housing right now. [Sam] a reliable stream of payments from captive tenants, is a big reason why these parks are so lucrative, providing investors with one of the highest annual returns of any asset in real estate -- higher than offices, commercial, industrial, you name it. [Photographer] [Group] [Resident] They don't care about us. They'd just as soon evict us, take our homes and then rent them out to somebody else for $200 more. [Sam] Three years ago, it was taken over by Homes of America, an affiliate of the hedge fund Alden Global Capital. Alden Global is best known for buying newspapers across the country and stripping their assets. [Theo] before Homes of America. We still pay the same amount as though we had a pool and as though we had a community center. But we have no community center either. [Sam] Homes of America has gone on a buying spree, spending nearly $300 million to acquire a 138 parks across 17 states. They've raised rents and aggressively evicted residents. After years of neglect, only about 15% of the lots in Theo's park are still occupied. [Sam] Homes of America is just a shell within a shell within a shell. Homes of America is Randy Smith. [Sam] and Chief Investment Officer of Alden Global. He lives in Palm Beach, Florida. As of 2017, he owned 17 mansions. He has since sold 14 of them for a reported profit of $57 million. Yeah, this is the plunder of private equity. This is what they do. Okay, everybody ready? Everybody rolling? Hi, good afternoon. [Sam] the county prosecutor brought charges against Homes of America's local LLC for operating the park without a license. It's the first time that the owner of a manufactured housing park in Michigan has ever faced that criminal charge. [County Prosecutor] inability to obtain a license is its seeming refusal to fix the park's water problem. [Theo] it kind of ruins your whole day. [David] of the out-of-state corporation that owns this park and force its officers and directors to do the right thing for the residents of this community. It's clear to me this corporation is putting profits before people. [Theo] Randall Smith, CEO of Alden. But he's hidden himself behind multiple shell layers. So getting to him is hard. These big companies buying up these communities now need some oversight, because right now they're free to abuse residents in pretty much every way they want. [Sam] owned by private equity firm Havenpark Communities. That's the same company that bought Madalyn's park, and it owns 63 other parks across the country. In the last six years, Havenpark has doubled Holly's housing costs. To avoid homelessness, she's had to take on two roommates. What power do you have right now in the existing legal structure to do anything about the rising rent or any of the fees? There's absolutely no recourse right now. About a year after this started, it's like something just broke in me and I started talking to some neighbors, saying, "We've got to gather and do something about this." [Paul] and they started going to their local township council meetings, and their city council meetings, and a few of them were able to make contact with a couple of state representatives, a Democrat named Senator John Cherry. [Holly] and told him about what Havenpark was doing, and that's what got him interested in drafting the bill package. [John Cherry] in the broadest sense, is to weed out the bad actors in the industry. What we're trying to do is make sure that folks don't get exploited. That's what this is about. [Sam] is the sponsor of legislation that would protect residents from the worst abuses of predatory landlords. The bills were drafted in 2021 by a coalition of residents and advocates, in direct negotiation with the landlord industry group. [Paul] that actually included the Michigan Manufactured Housing Association. [Sam] to justify any rent increase above the rate of inflation in front of the state commission. It would also limit the fees that landlords can charge, make utility charges transparent, require notification when a park is sold, and force landlords to pay fair market value for a home if a resident is evicted. These are really modest protections, so it's not everything that we need right now. It's not going to set the rents back to what they were or anything like that, but it would start to make things more fair. It would just be a modest start. [Sam] the legislation passed the House with overwhelming bipartisan support. The bill is passed. [Sam] In the early part of 2022, the Michigan Manufactured Housing Association did a 180, pulled their support, and it died in the Michigan State Senate. When we looked at the records, we did see that that coincided with the Michigan Manufactured Housing Association PAC suddenly getting some very big donations. [Sam] two Havenpark executives gave $358,000 to the industry PAC. [Holly] Manufactured Housing Association just totally pulled their support. [Paul] that I know, that's their grocery money. That's their prescription copay. That's the medicine that they're doing without and the food that they're doing without, because these people were gouging them. [Holly] are being taken advantage of. And some people have to choose between rising rent, medications and food. [Sam] went to the state capitol to lobby for a new version of the bill package. I'm testifying in support of Senate bills 486 through 490. There's no free market when residents are trapped. [Sam] in the upcoming legislative session this September and October. [Paul] from the Democrats in the House, and we have some Republicans who've committed to support as well. How many legislators would you say you've met with? I would say at least 100 of them. We've met with almost all of the Michigan Senate or their staff, and now we're starting to work on the House. [Sam] are just one type of property that large investors have targeted in recent years. But these parks are ground zero in a fight that affects all of us, the fight for meaningful control of our neighborhoods and for housing that people from all walks of life can afford. [Madalyn] and everybody deserves to have affordable housing. We just want a livable place.
