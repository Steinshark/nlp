Jonathan: &quot;Yeah, so feel free to have a play! I don't know if you played mercenary already?!&quot; Catmaster: &quot;I did, I did! I was so excited to check out the... No, no! It's a great idea because that's actually the class I'm most interested in...&quot; Catmaster: &quot;... 'cause so far I've only played the shooting while moving in LA on the controller.&quot; Jonathan: &quot;Right, right! Okay!&quot; Jonathan: &quot;So if you use the Q, uh, shotgun, with the ice then there's a specific mechanic here where frozen enemies can be shattered by the shotgun!&quot; Catmaster: &quot;Okay, so: I first press R, freeze, and then I use the Q and...&quot; &lt;enemy shatters&gt; Catmaster: &quot;ALRIGHT!&quot; Jonathan: &quot;So, there's also an AOE when you do that so it's actually very good in packs, because you get overlapping AOE circles and...&quot; Jonathan: &quot;Uh, can be quite a lot of damage.&quot; Jonathan: &quot;The other thing as well is that in PoE2 the resistances do mater more, so you're more encouraged to use different skills so when you have those plant guys...&quot; Jonathan: &quot;...it's best to use the fire shotgun, which is on middle click.&quot; Jonathan: &quot;So, middle and then left click to shoot!&quot; Jonathan: &quot;So, this fire thing, you know, it's going to do a lot more damage to trees, being that it burns them, so, yeah that's kind of...&quot; Catmaster: &quot;I used that a lot in the gameplay demo where you start at level 13&quot; Catmaster: &quot;Okay, so... try that... and the trees are extra vulnerable?&quot; Catmaster: &quot;Oh, it's a Ritual!&quot; Catmaster: &quot;Familiar faces!&quot; Jonathan: &quot;Just, uh... try not to die! Use grenades by the way! Right click!&quot; Catmaster: &quot;Oh yeah! Right, right! Grenades for big AOE coverage!&quot; Jonathan: &quot;Yeah, yeah! &lt;laughs&gt; The, uh... we've put multiple projectiles on there so, you know, you can... uh...&quot; Catmaster: &quot;Awesome!&quot; Catmaster: &quot;Wow, this is so cool!&quot; Catmaster: &quot;I've never played on such a big screen but I always figured it would be amazing! Because I know that all the assets are so high resolution that...&quot; Catmaster: &quot;You can theoretically scale it up to 4K or 8 and it'd look great but I never had such a big screen in front of me. That's cool!&quot; Jonathan: &quot;Honestly, I wish this was a 120 Hz display. So, at home, I play on a 55 inch TV. Like, I use a TV as my monitor and it's 120 Hz and uh... yeah...&quot; Jonathan: &quot;Huh, they spawned right next to each other! ...and it's a much... it's a very nice experience!&quot; Catmaster: &quot;Yeah, yeah! T hat directly makes me want to go in with some praise, because you really didn't hold back on investments this time for gamescom!&quot; Catmaster: &quot;Because, like, downstairs in the B2C area the displays and the computers are so good!&quot; Catmaster: &quot;Like, it runs with over a hundred fps and I think they also have some GSync or Freesync... so, it's a... a tearless wonderful gameplay...&quot; Catmaster: &quot;...and I finally get to experience how beautiful the game is 'cause that was one of my biggest complaints last year was...&quot; Catmaster: &quot;Unfortunately, everything wasn't quite as good Catmaster: &quot;...because the game is so amazing!&quot; Jonathan: &quot;So, uh, yeah! Obviously there's the skill... uh, don't pay too much attention to the individual placement of everything because...&quot; Jonathan: &quot;...we're still highly under development! One thing/feature you might be interested to know is that...&quot; Jonathan: &quot;...if you hold down Shift, then you can see, uh, the DPS changes that this Skill will give you.&quot; Catmaster: &quot;Okay, that's just that one particular passive? Or all the ones leading up to them?&quot; Jonathan: &quot;Uh, just that one passive!&quot; Jonathan: &quot;So it isn't PoB! It's just... you get one at a time but there's still PoB for that, but it is just useful for new players to be able to see...&quot; Jonathan: &quot;...you know, what it'd do. And if you do it on, like, a non-damaging thing, then you should be able...&quot; Jonathan: &quot;...to see like what the changes on your character from one to the other so it's just quite handy&quot; Catmaster: &quot;Yeah!&quot; Jonathan: &quot;this changes quite a lot of things about your character so you get all the stats and you know it's quite... quite interesting!&quot; Jonathan: &quot;We actually are gonna have this also for items, too! It's not implemented yet.&quot; Jonathan: &quot;So when you're hovering over an item to see whether or what it will do to your character...&quot; Jonathan: &quot;...you can see what DPS change it will have on all your skills and other... the other stat changes and in one screen as well as leveling up skills and, uh....&quot; Jonathan: &quot;now in one screen... as well as leveling up skills and things like that!&quot; Catmaster: &quot;Uhh, do you mind if I just go into attack speed or do you have any...&quot; Catmaster: &quot;I would just path directly into the attack speed...&quot; Catmaster: &quot;I'm not looking for... I'm not planning to get that in PoE2 when it releases but... like, for now I think that's probably a good thing.&quot; Jonathan: &quot;Yeah Yeah! The other thing is, of course, yes, we now have the ability to specify what attribute and...&quot; Catmaster: &quot;Is that... for all the travel nodes?&quot; Jonathan: &quot;And you can actually re-spec them without having to un-spec down to them either so you can change what attributes you have on the tree...&quot; Jonathan: &quot;...just using gold if you want.&quot; Catmaster: &quot;Okay!&quot; Catmaster: &quot;Yeah, that's amazing because I... I think that's really important that the barrier of entry gets lowered.&quot; Catmaster: &quot;And especially.... especially when I was starting Path of Exile back in 2014 it was a much smaller game than it is now.&quot; Jonathan: &quot;Right!&quot; Jonathan: &quot;You can hold this one down by the way to just keep firing! The assault rifle!&quot; Catmaster: &quot;Oh right, yeah!&quot; Catmaster: &quot;You... are you calling it an assault rifle?&quot; Jonathan: &quot;That isn't its real name but basically that's what it is!&quot; Jonathan: &quot;So, uh, yeah!&quot; Jonathan: &quot;Yeah, yeah! Uh, use the... yeah, yeah! There ya go!&quot; Catmaster: &quot;I haven't internalized the combos yet!&quot; Jonathan: &quot;So,...&quot; Jonathan: &quot;Oh! Uh, sorry, the dev build - as I mentioned - has, you know, problems. Yeah and I'll just uh revive you!&quot; Kikis (in background): &quot;I've seen that freeze death of yours!&quot; Catmaster: &quot;yeah I had that on live before I think! Jonathan: &quot;Hehe, right, okay! Yeah, hang on! Let me just deal with this.&quot; Catmaster: &quot;But yeah, I had a segue-question from, you know, lowering the barrier of entry because there's so much to learn for a new player...&quot; Catmaster: &quot;I always felt like I had to tab out constantly and now there's so much information in the game, streamlined. You get, like, the choice of gems...&quot; Jonathan: &quot;Yeah, yeah!&quot; Catmaster: &quot;What I wanted to ask in relation to gems is: When Catmaster: &quot;...but I also get to level up existing skills!&quot; Jonathan: &quot;...and we now have this system and - honestly - this change was so good!&quot; Jonathan: &quot;It's funny because, you know, one of the classic 'noob questions' in Poe is like 'why do I have to manually level up my skills?'&quot; Jonathan: &lt;looks at screen&gt; &quot;What the hell?! Oh, did I put... I think Catmaster: &quot;Oh!&quot; Jonathan: &quot;Yeah, I just did it by accident earlier... Jonathan: &quot;Right, what the hell was I saying? Uh, that's right, yes!&quot; Jonathan: &quot;Right, right, right! So, a classic 'noob' question in PoE1 was: &quot;why do I have to manually level up my skills?&quot; and there were reasons...&quot; Jonathan: &quot;But the thing - that I didn't realize until recently - is that the reason, uh... What that implies is that leveling up a skill isn't a fun thing to do.&quot; Jonathan: &quot;So, I was like: Okay, what's an easy way we can make leveling up fun and we discussed all these options and honestly the really simplest one...&quot; Jonathan: &quot;...is just giving you a choice of what skill to level. And as soon as you do that...&quot; Jonathan: &quot;... because you got the choice of what to level now it just immediately, like... there's like: 'Uuh, am I going to pick this? Am I going to pick that?'&quot; Jonathan: &quot;Like, it just immediately does that! So it's like a free character customization system that was always just sitting there waiting to be discovered.&quot; Jonathan: &quot;And really when you come right down to it it's just D2, right?&quot; Jonathan: &quot;Like, uh, that's effectively with the skill system and skill tree system that we have now there.&quot; Jonathan: &quot;Of course when you allocate the skill you get, you know... There's still items and so on and, uh,...&quot; Jonathan: &quot;Leveling them up, you know, requires you to find Uncut Gems. So effectively now the quest at endgame is going to be...&quot; Jonathan: &quot;...to get level 20 skills is now not gonna be a grind. It's, well, I mean, it still is ultimately but it's, uh...&quot; Catmaster: &quot;It's not an experience grind but a drop grind!&quot; Jonathan: &quot;So, uh, yeah, that is going to be a thing that means of course you can trade for level 20 skills now and that means getting Level 20 skills.&quot; Jonathan: &quot;I mean, I suppose you could before 'cause you could just trade the gems but, you know, you can trade for a generic Uncut gem...&quot; Jonathan: &quot;... and get a lvl 20 from whatever you want immediately.&quot; Jonathan: &quot;So, it just makes that gameplay I think quite a little better and honestly it's way more fun during leveling and...&quot; Jonathan: &quot;It's also quite interesting I think to have the choice of what skills on my character do I want to be the ones that I'm focusing on.&quot; Jonathan: &quot;So yeah I think it improved things quite a lot!&quot; Catmaster: &quot;Uhh, I'm curious, I have to ask because when settlers was announced and we were all trying to figure out what Settlers is going to be...&quot; Catmaster: &quot;...we dug into the old podcasts and dev interviews on Baeclast (podcast) and here and there because I was so sure...&quot; Catmaster: &quot;...there's more references to board games that we can find out.&quot; Catmaster: &quot;Because we know you're friends of board games, but there was surprisingly little material.&quot; Catmaster: &quot;Is there anything that you can talk about in relation to your board game hobby inspiring decisions in the professional game design?&quot; Jonathan: &quot;I mean, I try to take inspiration from everywhere be it board games or, you know, or any movies or just literally anything, right?&quot; Jonathan: &quot;I mean one of my favorite things to do is take some mechanic from another genre and bring it to PoE but, you know...&quot; Jonathan: &quot;I mean like obviously I wish I got more time to play board games these days! Uh, right now, since I have a small son...&quot; Jonathan: &quot;I'm pretty much restricted to the most basic uh the Jonathan: &quot;But, you know, I've always been a fan of this kind of thing and, you know, yeah, all the classic euro games, you know, I'm a big fan.&quot; Jonathan: &quot;But, you know, probably my first love when it comes to physical games is Magic the Gathering and I think you see a lot of influence in PoE from that.&quot; Jonathan: &quot;Just from the way... especially in PoE2 now as well...&quot; &lt;looking at screen&gt; Jonathan: &quot;Wha... Uh, what the hell? Okay?! That was...&quot; Catmaster: &quot;The monster was stuck...&quot; Jonathan: &quot;Uh, but uh, yeah! I mean you see a lot of that in PoE2 especially, where... we're keywording a lot more things.&quot; Jonathan: &quot;And then we're utilizing those keywords across different classes a lot more.&quot; Jonathan: &quot;And that kind of thing just leads - I think - to a lot more interesting Combos and, you know, just like in Magic the Gathering, you...&quot; Jonathan: &quot;You know, give people a lot of tools and they'll find interesting ways to use them Jonathan: &quot;Which I mean we always had in PoE from a... uh... in some way but not usually within the actual active skills themselves...&quot; Jonathan: &quot;You know, like, you usually would just be spamming one skill and it was all about maximizing that one thing.&quot; Jonathan: &quot;And I was very keen to have more combo gameplay between skills and actually have that be more of a factor.&quot; Catmaster: &quot;But without, like, basically forcing the player into it?&quot; Jonathan: &quot;No you don't HAVE to do it, of course, but, you know, you're gonna be rewarded if you do it and, uh...&quot; Jonathan: &quot;It's funny actually, because a lot of the time people are like 'oh, I just want to spam this, it's the best!' and then you're like...&quot; Jonathan: &quot;'Oh but if you just add this one skill, you know it'll be, your build will be, like 30% better, and they're like: 'Oh well, yeah, I guess I'll use that then.&quot; Jonathan: &quot;And then, like a few... after not too long they've added three or four more things that uh improve things and they're happily comboing away!&quot; Catmaster: &quot;I noted that with the armor piercing rounds and the high velocity rounds...&quot; Jonathan: &quot;So, that one is very good for very high... very high defense monsters but also using the High Velocity rounds to...&quot; Jonathan: &quot;...just prepare for a shotgun blast is actually very good as well.&quot; Jonathan: &quot;Because, uh, since armor as you... I'm sure you know is better against small hits than big ones it means that...&quot; Jonathan: &quot;Breaking the armor off before using the shotgun is very important 'cause the shotgun actually hits uh I believe 12 times...&quot; Jonathan: &quot;...with lots of tiny hits and so it's actually... Armor is very very, it makes monsters with armor very resistant to it (the shotgun).&quot; Jonathan: &quot;So you really want to break the armor off, if you want to use it effectively.&quot; Catmaster: &quot;Yeah, so... you also recently revealed that...&quot; Catmaster: &quot;You're making defenses work against everything, so there's... Jonathan: &quot;Yes, exactly! So that was something where I want the... You can tell what element an attack is fairly easily, especially in PoE2.&quot; Jonathan: &quot;We're being very careful to be very consistent with the visuals for our elemental attacks, but it's very hard to judge sometimes...&quot; Jonathan: &quot;It's very hard to judge sometimes what thing is an attack versus a spell.&quot; Jonathan: &quot;I mean I think people who play PoE for a long time kind of understand that, but I think it was something that was actually detracting from readability of things.&quot; Jonathan: &quot;So that's why we decided to change that!&quot; Catmaster: &quot;Well, I mean, there's a lot of things in PoE1 that look like spells but they're coded as attacks and they work as attacks.&quot; Jonathan: &quot;Yeah, so, you know, I think that it's better.&quot; Jonathan: &quot;Like if you if you can't tell in advance what something is I think it's better that we don't have your defenses care about it.&quot; Jonathan: &quot;Yeah, that's something that I believe in and hence why we're changing it, but...&quot; Jonathan: &quot;You know, there's no life on the tree now so that means that defenses are, you know, something that you have to care more about.&quot; Jonathan: &quot;Although, you still can get flat Life with Strength. You now get three Life per Strength and since any class can get it no matter where they are...&quot; Jonathan: &quot;That actually is quite an important element of getting life and in fact all three of the attributes are sort of important, right?&quot; Jonathan: &quot;Because you can get Mana and Accuracy from the other two...&quot; Catmaster: &quot;Okay there, the other two are still the same?&quot; Jonathan: &quot;All these three things are things that every player Jonathan: &quot;So having the ability to pick those at any time I think is actually quite an improvement.&quot; Catmaster: &quot;It gives you more freedom to navigate the tree to the things that you really care about.&quot; Catmaster: &quot;Instead of like having to pick up the basic requirements or having to cover them elsewhere.&quot; Jonathan: &quot;I don't know if you also noticed the way that support gem requirements have changed now by the way?!&quot; Jonathan: &quot;If you kill these monsters and then open the skill Jonathan: &quot;So, yeah, if you open the Gem Screen, so G...&quot; Jonathan: &quot;So uh the way that we've uh done this so at the top you'll see there's... You can see how many Support Gems of each colour you can have.&quot; Jonathan: &quot;And the way it works is that every five points of an attribute will give you one more slot for that type of gem.&quot; Jonathan: &quot;So, effectively, you're always exactly one attribute node away from being able to get another socket of that colour.&quot; Jonathan: &quot;So right now, because obviously you're a Strength/DEX Character you can put a reasonable number of Strength and DEX things.&quot; Jonathan: &quot;But you can't have too many INT gems on your character. But if you want to have a lot of INT gems you could just allocate some more INT to be able to do that.&quot; Jonathan: &quot;So it works differently than requirements normally do and I think it's actually improved things a lot because it, uh, yeah,...&quot; Jonathan: &quot;It still has that feeling of, like, if I want to go off-attribute I still have to put some effort into it but I think it works a lot better than the requirements in PoE1 did.&quot; Catmaster: &quot;Okay, but you still have to do the Jeweler thing and roll the sockets on the Skill Gems? (or is that something...)&quot; Jonathan: &quot;So, there's no socket colors anymore they're all just white um but uh the the attributes effectively control which one you do.&quot; Jonathan: &quot;Now, there are items that add more sockets and those you find as you go through the game so the upgrade from two to three is quite a big one.&quot; Jonathan: &quot;And then you can get, you know, three to four, four to five, and five to six.&quot; Level Infinite Lady &lt;looking at Jonathan's schedule&gt;: Jonathan: &quot;Ah sure, no problem!&quot; Jonathan: &quot;Yea, we probably covered a bunch of random stuff without you looking at your questions.&quot; Catmaster: &quot;Yeah! No, I'm really curious about... A couple months ago you took everyone for a ride when you teased...&quot; Catmaster: &quot;...that there will be Rhoa mounts. Has there been any evolution on the idea of a mount in PoE?&quot; Jonathan: &quot;I mean they're still there on the Ranger. We just haven't been... it's just too high level for the these demo characters to do.&quot; Catmaster: &quot;Okay, so it's like it's a passage in the story or does it have a place in endgame?&quot; Jonathan: &quot;No, No. It's a Spirit reservation.&quot; Jonathan: &quot;So what it really is is a Minion. It's just a Minion type, it uses a 100 Spirit to reserve it and then the Rhoa will attack things when you're not mounted on it.&quot; Jonathan: &quot;But, yes, it has a special ability to get on top and then you suffer no movement penalty while shooting on the back of a Rhoa.&quot; Jonathan: &quot;But if you get heavy stunned then it's a very big, uh, it's like a fall down with like it's many seconds to recover from.&quot; Jonathan: &quot;So... you have to be very careful and it can be better to jump off when you're going to engage certain enemies.&quot; Jonathan: &quot;Uh, and any skill that jumps will jump you off the back.&quot; Jonathan: &quot;So, that means that you, yeah, you can get off very quickly if you need to.&quot; Catmaster: &quot;Okay, yeah I was just wondering whether that's that's still something we can get excited to see, because we we've just heard it once and...&quot; Catmaster: &quot;It hasn't been present in the demos or anything.&quot; Jonathan: &quot;Yeah, yeah! As I said it's just too high level, so... you know...&quot; Catmaster: &quot;Okay, just one more question: If we have the chance to play a little bit more downstairs...&quot; Catmaster: &quot;What would you recommend I do? I played the mercenary. What are you really proud that is in this demo?&quot; Jonathan: &quot;Uhhh, well, I mean that's... there... I like all the classes! But I don't know if you've tried the minion class yet?&quot; Catmaster: &quot;No... no...&quot; Jonathan: &quot;I think you might want to try that, you know, it's quite fun.&quot; Jonathan: &quot;Ye, nice!&quot; Catmaster: &quot;Okay, thank you for taking the time!&quot; George W. Bush meme: &quot;I know a lot of people
