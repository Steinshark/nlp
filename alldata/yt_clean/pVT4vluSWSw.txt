(Evil laugh) Ha ha ha ha! Ha! My Grandma can run faster than you. Well guess what? My Grandma taught your Grandma how to run. They have no idea what is in store for them! Ho Ho Ho... Bye-bye Sonic! Why? That's Sonic finally here. Hey Dr. Robotnik... How do you like the slammer? Wipe that smug little smile off your face! You're never gonna get over losing to me in that race...are you? You just wait Sonic I only have one more year in this place here...and then I'm coming after you!! Oh Dr Robotnik... you're so terrifying. Besides you couldn't catch me anyway. You are not the fastest in the land Sonic! Ha Ha Ha Ha Uhh yes I am! Apparently you've never heard of zee Flash. Nice try! No one's faster than me. Then you haven't heard of the Flash? ha ha ha ha ha. If the Flash really does exist one of my rings will show me where he is. Oh no my rings!!! Alright got them all! Show me the Flash! No way this guy is real?! Oh, yes, and he's way faster than you will ever be Sonic! Why have I never heard of him before? My plan is working. (evil laugh) Impossible! I still have so much more to learn about this planet. Oh, yes the Flash is a superhero... There's lots of superheroes on this planet. Superheroes? If you let me out Sonic I will take you to him. I bet you a lifetime behind bars, that you will lose to the Flash in a race. A race?! I don't need you to take me to him, but I'm interested in your bet, and I guess we need someone to start the race. Yes oh yes! Okay, if I win this race and let you out temporarily you promise that you'll be behind bars forever? But of course! Forever! (Evil laughter) Fine let's go find the Flash. For once it would be nice to have a little competition. Can't wait to win this race too! HaHa Ha Ha I'm out of here! I'm out of here! HA HA! Seriously! You knock off you dumb laugh or your not coming. Fine let's go. Ha ha ha it worked! This must be where the Flash lives. Oh, yes it is! That's my trick! Who does this guy think he is?! Oh who's that? What a show off! Ha Ha Ha! Here is comes. Ha Ha Ha! Hey guys are you here for an autograph? Uhhh no way! No Flash this is Sonic the Hedgehog. Sonic the who?! Sonic the Hedgehog. Are hedgehog's even real? I thought they were one of those mythical creatures like unicorns, or narwhal's. Um, yeah hedgehogs are real and by the way, so are narwhals, and this hedgehog is so fast.. they even made a Hollywood movie about me! Well Flash I bet you haven't been in any movies. Ever heard of the Justice League? Flash Point? The Flash? You might be the fastest superhero, but I'm the fastest animal in the universe!! Well, it seems obvious to me that you two need to race each other. Ha ha ha Superhero versus animal..I like my odds. I got this. Good luck Flash. Runners this way with me. Ha Ha Ha here we go! The race of the century! We have Sonic the Hedgehog. Oh yeah! Oh yeah! That's right! versus the Flash! Wow! I can't wait to see who wins! This is incredible! So the race will go around this house three times. What? That's not even a race? That will take 3 seconds. That's so easy! Okay, ummm then to the Statue of Liberty. Okay. Better? That's better. But I still don't think you have any super speed. Oh ho ho..smack talking! Okay, runners take your marks! Sure you want to end this now? I'm totally sure of it. Good luck Hedgehog. Good luck flashy pants! The first one back.. wins the race and will be the fastest in the universe! Here we go! Are you ready?! Yes. Yes. Get setty... and going!!! Oh ho ho it's working! My plan is working. Ha Ha Ha Now to set up the finish line. Ha! My Grandma can run faster than you! Well guess what, my Grandma taught your Grandma how to run! Ha! You sure? Because my Grandma taught me how to do this. Are you sure about your Grandmas? He he he not that we'll be needing this anyways. Ha Ha Ha (evil laughter) Look there's the Statue of Liberty! And then we get to go back home and prove that I'm the real fastest! HaHaHaHa (evil laughter) Oh ho ho Sonic you should not have dropped your precious rings! I guess you are pretty fast for a human. Huh I never thought a hedgehog could be that fast. They have no idea what is in store for them when they come to the finish line! Ha Ha Ha! Oh ho ho here they come! Here they come! (evil laughter) Bye bye Sonic! Whoa! Oh no what..what happened?! Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! Hahaha he's gone! Sonic the Hedgehog is gone! Ha Ha Ha! Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! What happened?! Flash I dropped all my rings and Dr. Robotnik must have taken one. Rings? Hahaha my trap for Sonic zee Hedgehog worked! Now to run and hide before he figures out where he is, and how to get back! No Flash my rings teleport me to other planets! Wait, you mean we're no longer on earth?! Yes, he tricked me! We need one of my rings to teleport us back to earth. So you're saying one of these gold rings will teleport us back to earth. Yes! Wait, what was that? Impossible! What that's just a hair? Could there possibly be another creature like me? What...what is it Sonic? Tell me! You see this? Do you see the resemblance? Wait, what's that? Ahhh Ah! Ah! Ohh a puppy! Ah! Ah! (Gasp) No way! What? What's going on here? Flash she says her name is Swifty and she's the fastest dog on this planet! Whoa! You've got to be kidding me! That sneaky Dr. Robotnik. He must have taken one of my rings when I let him out of jail. He was in prison , and you let him out! Yes, he tricked me into letting him out. So you and I would race, and he said you were faster. Well by now he definitely escaped. She says she's faster than us, and she wants to have a race. Nice try fur-ball.. we all know that I'm the fastest! Plus we're gonna have to come back and race later. Um, nice try... we all know that I'm the fastest here. And yeah, you're right we better get out of here! Well, what are we waiting for? Let's go get that Dr. Robotnik! Good call! Whoa, she really is fast! Well see ya Swifty! Um are you sure this is going to work? Yep! Hi yah! Whoa! Ready? Let's go! Whoa it worked! Of course it worked. Oh no, I was worried about this Dr. Robotnik must have gotten away! Um well your problem now. No Flash help me! You don't know how powerful Dr. Robotnik could be. Superheroes could do anything especially help a little hedgehog out. Thanks Flash I'll take the help. But I think he went that way! Let's go! (evil laughter) Ho Ho Ho my plan worked! Sonic is gone! Ha Ha zee Flash is gone! Ha ha now time for my master plan! I'm going to find a cave. I'm going to build a giant machine! And I'm going to take over zee world!!! ha ha ha ha
