During the 1960s, advanced military trainers demanding better pilot preparation. Amid the rush, a small German company named idea; they set out to build a jet that wasn't The Fan Trainer was a military trainer pretending engine with a ducted fan behind the cockpit at a reduced operating cost. So RFB created a fighter jet like no other, for decades and is looking to make a comeback... Dummy Run During the 1960s, fighter aircraft evolved Consequently, a similar trend followed in Aircraft such as the Northrop T-38, the Mitsubishi response to the escalating demands on new These aspiring aviators were required to navigate the competence needed for flying. Therefore, this advancement in training also training timeline. The transition between pilots qualifying on now complex advanced jet trainers became a Still, this discrepancy prompted the development A modern initiative to bridge this gap led Alpha Jet and the British Aerospace Hawk. However, a humble German aviation company Contemplating the idea of designing an aircraft a basic trainer while incorporating the handling innovation aimed to mitigate the abrupt learning to streamline their trainer aircraft maintenance The result would be a classic tandem two-seat of the Alpha Jet trainer but with a twist. Like A Jet small but adventurous German company set up They began their work with an original one-off-pusher Soon, it was time to push the envelope a bit As modernity dawned, they ventured into the The company was fascinated by the idea of This curiosity quickly turned into action As the decade progressed, the incipient interest In 1970, the company recognized a need in which they believed had the potential to exploit They unveiled ambitious plans for a two-seat as the Fantrainer. The overarching goal was clear: to engineer of jet-powered counterparts while remaining Remarkably, the aircraft's distinctive feature behind the cockpit, situated in the middle This innovation successfully replicated the positioning the powerplant mid-way, a departure in other trainers. Besides, this revolutionary placement resulted jet aircraft. Moreover, these achievements were accomplished fuel costs associated with jet trainers. Admittedly, although the speed was notably novice pilots with an authentic experience of their basic flight training. Indeed, the concept itself appeared highly A Vested Interest distinctive feature, a mid-mounted ducted to offer performance on par with conventional operational costs. When compared to its contemporary counterpart, trainer aircraft, the Fantrainer boasted a one-tenth of the fuel. Furthermore, the Fantrainer was presented asserting that its procurement expenses were T-37 Tweet. Yet, the model had a slightly slower top speed. Nevertheless, the Fantrainer delivered comparable of the fuel. Despite its merits, the primary target audience, interest. Consequently, in 1973, RFB redirected its model named the RFB Fanliner. This civilian version served a dual purpose: to generate interest. Certainly, the introduction of the RFB Fanliner Ministry of Defense. Recognizing the potential value in the concept, construction of two prototype Fantrainer aircraft. By March, Rhein Flugzeugbau had secured a The task at hand was the production and testing These prototypes would undergo rigorous evaluation initial trainers within the Luftwaffe's fleet. Impressively, within seven months of initiating for testing. Peas In A Pod around efficiency, cost reduction, and user-friendliness. Notably, its engine control system employed accustomed to traditional turbojets, emphasizing The innovative engine and fan setup featured speed control. The British Dowty Group's reduction gear reduced fan speed at 3,090 revolutions per minute, measures such as Hoffmann's plastic-coated Key design elements included a foam-plastic clearance, ensuring performance. The fan's ring slot design ensured smooth adjusting asymmetrically for varied inflow Structurally, the Fantrainer featured a metal flexibility in cockpit shape changes. The spacious cockpit housed extensive instrumentation Force aircraft, influenced by the Alpha Jet's Maintenance convenience was a priority, achieved units. The forward-swept wing, influenced by the concerns by avoiding wing root obstruction. Fuel efficiency was achieved with integrated and components like Friese ailerons and air Rain Or Shine registered as D-EATJ took place on October Its power was derived from a pair of EA871 However, the EA871 engine installation encountered Subsequently, the second prototype, D-EATI, Allison 250-C20B turboshaft engine, completed 1978. Tragically, the course of development was On September 7, 1978, the second prototype on the first prototype, leading to its upgrade The modifications included the installation air intake system. As a result of the incident, the Luftwaffe - a comparative analysis involving the Beechcraft Despite the Fantrainer's advantageous cost-efficiency and being regarded by some as the best option, P.149, deeming it adequate for their training However, the absence of a Luftwaffe contract In May 1982, the company announced its intentions in the coming months. By then, the prototype had amassed an impressive five-week marketing tour across America, during per day. Although Rhein Flugzeugbau projected a potential over the subsequent decade, the company set 4 percent, equating to 200 aircraft, acknowledging Notably, enhancements continued. In 1983, the prototype underwent further refinement. The original seven-bladed ducted fan was replaced counterpart. Cockpit improvements were also introduced, and markedly improved external visibility. Debut additional input, RFB decided to refine their resulting in the development of two main models: The Fantrainer 400 model addressed previous engines with the more reliable Allison Model In contrast, the Fantrainer 600 model featured horsepower, enabling a top speed of around of flight time. Both models embraced modular production, sharing manufacturing. However, their success is a subject of debate. The Thai Air Force found the concept of a 400 units in 1982 for primary training and their F-5E fighters. They even held options for 26 additional examples. The Thai FT-600s' cockpit configuration was ejection seats. Production involved two units in Germany and Deliveries began in 1984, with integration To withstand the tropical climate, Thai FT-400s from fiberglass. Unfortunately, this shift caused deployment The FT-400s faced operational issues during smoother performance of the FT-600s. Backpedal the successful sale to Thailand served as in marketing. An ambitious proposal emerged, outlining the for deployment in Paraguay. The vision for this aircraft extended its However, despite the initial enthusiasm, this RFB. Undeterred by the previous obstacles, RFB During the mid-1980s, their aspirations took lucrative contract. Unfortunately, history repeated itself as Faced with reality, RFB opted for a strategic Collaborating with Rockwell International, highly coveted US military's JPATS program. This partnership yielded the Rockwell Ranger disappointment. Nonetheless, the repercussions of this outcome closure of RFB's operations in 1992. Consequently, the prospects for the Fantrainer Moreover, the limited service it had provided geopolitical landscape shifted post-Cold War The Thai Air Force found a more cost-effective Jets. However, the Fantrainer refused to reach its Second Wind Defying the odds, three units of the aircraft These sporadically made captivating appearances enthusiasts of the aircraft's enduring legacy. In a surprising turn of events in 2010, a which acquired all the rights and manufacturing Fuelled by an unrelenting enthusiasm, Fanjet the production of the Fantrainer. The revival plan includes the integration glass cockpit instrumentation. Even so, the realization of this vision hinges to embrace this unique aircraft for their Thank you for tuning into our video!
